many bolts issues i'm assuming three but
the<00:00:25.800> reason<00:00:25.980> why<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.369> title<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:26.970> named<00:00:27.330> it's

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
the reason why this title is named it's

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.769 
the reason why this title is named it's
why<00:00:28.230> it<00:00:28.289> is<00:00:28.470> it's<00:00:28.740> because<00:00:28.949> this<00:00:29.160> gun<00:00:29.490> is

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
why it is it's because this gun is

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.450 
why it is it's because this gun is
extremely<00:00:30.779> powerful<00:00:30.990> i<00:00:31.380> don't<00:00:31.560> know<00:00:31.679> if<00:00:31.769> any

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
extremely powerful i don't know if any

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.680 
extremely powerful i don't know if any
of<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.669> guys<00:00:32.759> have<00:00:32.820> had<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.239> chance<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.570> use

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
of you guys have had the chance to use

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.150 
of you guys have had the chance to use
it<00:00:33.719> yet<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.110> this<00:00:34.230> gun<00:00:34.440> is<00:00:34.469> extremely

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
it yet but this gun is extremely

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.709 
it yet but this gun is extremely
powerful<00:00:35.340> i<00:00:35.670> would<00:00:35.790> actually<00:00:35.940> I'm<00:00:36.300> go<00:00:36.510> as<00:00:36.570> far

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
powerful i would actually I'm go as far

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.049 
powerful i would actually I'm go as far
to<00:00:36.750> say<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.050> overpowered<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.760> the<00:00:38.760> reason

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
to say it's overpowered and the reason

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.100 
to say it's overpowered and the reason
why<00:00:39.149> this<00:00:39.210> game<00:00:39.480> looks<00:00:39.570> kind<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:39.840> weird<00:00:39.899> is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
why this game looks kind of weird is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.510 
why this game looks kind of weird is
because<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.559> recorded<00:00:41.040> from<00:00:41.100> theater

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
because this is recorded from theater

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.549 
because this is recorded from theater
mode<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.969> in<00:00:42.510> black<00:00:42.750> ops<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.170> theater<00:00:43.440> mode

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
mode and in black ops the theater mode

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.049 
mode and in black ops the theater mode
they<00:00:43.739> didn't<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.100> killcams<00:00:44.520> but<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.910> game

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
they didn't have killcams but this game

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.930 
they didn't have killcams but this game
they<00:00:45.239> do<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:46.250> I'm<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.399> one<00:00:47.550> thing<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.730> I<00:00:47.879> did

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
they do so I'm the one thing that I did

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.630 
they do so I'm the one thing that I did
notice<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:48.570> that<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.980> like<00:00:50.219> when<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.399> move

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
notice is that the it like when you move

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.830 
notice is that the it like when you move
really<00:00:50.910> fast<00:00:50.940> since<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.539> as<00:00:51.660> high

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
really fast since I have as high

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.540 
really fast since I have as high
sensitivity<00:00:52.320> i<00:00:52.530> think<00:00:52.710> i<00:00:52.770> plan<00:00:52.949> on<00:00:52.980> six<00:00:53.309> when<00:00:53.520> i

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
sensitivity i think i plan on six when i

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.100 
sensitivity i think i plan on six when i
use<00:00:53.699> regular<00:00:54.000> guns<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.420> eight<00:00:54.600> when<00:00:54.870> i<00:00:54.899> use

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
use regular guns and eight when i use

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.470 
use regular guns and eight when i use
the<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.800> sniper<00:00:56.039> rifle<00:00:56.430> oh<00:00:56.579> I'm<00:00:57.149> using<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the the sniper rifle oh I'm using the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.819 
the the sniper rifle oh I'm using the
high<00:00:57.539> sensitivity<00:00:57.960> when<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.289> do<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.649> like<00:00:58.800> a

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
high sensitivity when I do it like a

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.979 
high sensitivity when I do it like a
really<00:00:59.070> fast<00:00:59.309> jerk<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.820> left<00:01:00.000> or<00:01:00.180> right<00:01:00.210> it

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
really fast jerk to the left or right it

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.270 
really fast jerk to the left or right it
looks<00:01:01.140> kind<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.379> weird<00:01:01.440> so<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.890> don't<00:01:02.160> know<00:01:02.250> if

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:42.740 
a lot of fun playing this game it's a i
thought<00:05:42.210> it<00:05:42.270> was<00:05:42.330> going<00:05:42.450> to<00:05:42.510> be<00:05:42.600> a<00:05:42.630> big

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:42.750 
thought it was going to be a big

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:44.720 
thought it was going to be a big
disappointment<00:05:42.930> because<00:05:43.500> mono<00:05:43.770> or<00:05:43.950> 42<00:05:44.250> it

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
disappointment because mono or 42 it

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.130 
disappointment because mono or 42 it
looks<00:05:44.910> exactly<00:05:45.060> like<00:05:45.420> monomorphic<00:05:45.870> you<00:05:46.080> i

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
looks exactly like monomorphic you i

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:47.750 
looks exactly like monomorphic you i
think<00:05:46.350> the<00:05:46.440> titles<00:05:46.770> and<00:05:46.830> emblems<00:05:47.010> of<00:05:47.280> exactly

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
think the titles and emblems of exactly

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.340 
think the titles and emblems of exactly
the<00:05:47.940> same<00:05:48.120> i<00:05:48.300> was<00:05:49.020> a<00:05:49.050> little<00:05:49.200> disappointed

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
the same i was a little disappointed

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.810 
the same i was a little disappointed
when<00:05:49.890> it<00:05:50.010> comes<00:05:50.130> to<00:05:50.250> the<00:05:50.340> titles<00:05:50.610> and<00:05:50.670> emblems

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 
when it comes to the titles and emblems

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.730 
when it comes to the titles and emblems
but<00:05:51.270> for<00:05:51.420> the<00:05:51.480> most<00:05:51.600> part<00:05:51.720> this<00:05:51.960> game<00:05:52.200> I<00:05:52.410> feel

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
but for the most part this game I feel

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.220 
but for the most part this game I feel
like<00:05:53.160> it's<00:05:53.400> more<00:05:53.700> balanced<00:05:54.270> than<00:05:54.360> 100<00:05:54.660> /<00:05:54.840> 2<00:05:54.990> and

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:55.230 
like it's more balanced than 100 / 2 and

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:56.450 
like it's more balanced than 100 / 2 and
I<00:05:55.290> don't<00:05:55.470> know<00:05:55.560> if<00:05:55.650> this<00:05:55.740> is<00:05:55.800> just<00:05:55.920> that<00:05:56.250> that

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:56.460 
I don't know if this is just that that

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:58.670 
I don't know if this is just that that
new<00:05:56.640> game<00:05:56.990> syndrome<00:05:57.990> that<00:05:58.170> people<00:05:58.440> get<00:05:58.560> when

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
new game syndrome that people get when

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:59.840 
new game syndrome that people get when
they<00:05:58.800> get<00:05:58.920> a<00:05:58.950> new<00:05:59.010> game<00:05:59.250> they<00:05:59.370> think<00:05:59.550> is<00:05:59.640> really

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850 
they get a new game they think is really

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.180 
they get a new game they think is really
awesome<00:05:59.970> and<00:06:00.390> everything<00:06:00.840> is<00:06:01.080> really<00:06:01.230> cool<00:06:01.440> so

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
awesome and everything is really cool so

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:04.220 
awesome and everything is really cool so
I'm<00:06:02.280> hoping<00:06:02.610> I'm<00:06:03.270> really<00:06:03.660> hoping<00:06:03.930> that<00:06:04.110> this

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
I'm hoping I'm really hoping that this

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:05.390 
I'm hoping I'm really hoping that this
game<00:06:04.380> doesn't<00:06:04.620> really<00:06:04.830> make<00:06:05.040> me<00:06:05.190> mad<00:06:05.220> like

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 
game doesn't really make me mad like

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.390 
game doesn't really make me mad like
mono<00:06:05.820> or<00:06:06.030> 42<00:06:06.300> did<00:06:06.560> and<00:06:07.560> i<00:06:07.680> think<00:06:08.010> the<00:06:08.160> the

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:08.400 
mono or 42 did and i think the the

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.030 
mono or 42 did and i think the the
addition<00:06:09.150> to<00:06:09.570> our<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:10.380> addition<00:06:10.740> to<00:06:10.830> the<00:06:10.920> game

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
addition to our the addition to the game

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.400 
addition to our the addition to the game
by<00:06:11.430> putting<00:06:12.090> in<00:06:12.180> the<00:06:12.240> strike<00:06:12.480> packages<00:06:12.960> is

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
by putting in the strike packages is

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.960 
by putting in the strike packages is
definitely<00:06:13.950> going<00:06:14.040> to<00:06:14.130> reduce<00:06:14.370> people<00:06:14.760> from

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
definitely going to reduce people from
