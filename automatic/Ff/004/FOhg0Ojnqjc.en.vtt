different but similar concept the oil
drain<00:00:10.380> plug<00:00:10.559> is<00:00:10.830> here<00:00:11.340> under<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.670> engine<00:00:11.849> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
drain plug is here under the engine the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.850 
drain plug is here under the engine the
easy<00:00:12.540> way<00:00:12.719> to<00:00:12.780> get<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.320> just<00:00:13.349> grab<00:00:13.740> it

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
easy way to get to it is just grab it

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.379 
easy way to get to it is just grab it
with<00:00:13.980> a<00:00:14.009> 24<00:00:14.400> millimeter<00:00:14.549> socket<00:00:15.150> from<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
with a 24 millimeter socket from the

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.359 
with a 24 millimeter socket from the
side<00:00:15.599> now<00:00:16.109> I<00:00:16.170> know<00:00:16.289> that<00:00:16.529> most<00:00:16.710> socket<00:00:17.130> sets

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
side now I know that most socket sets

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.920 
side now I know that most socket sets
that<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:17.699> buy<00:00:17.850> don't<00:00:18.150> have<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> 24<00:00:18.810> millimeter

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
that you buy don't have a 24 millimeter

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.380 
that you buy don't have a 24 millimeter
socket<00:00:19.560> so<00:00:19.710> if<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.250> don't<00:00:20.520> have<00:00:20.789> one<00:00:21.180> either

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
socket so if you don't have one either

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.679 
socket so if you don't have one either
go<00:00:21.600> buy<00:00:21.779> one<00:00:21.990> or<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.529> take<00:00:22.740> off<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:23.220> bolt

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
go buy one or you take off this bolt

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:26.420 
go buy one or you take off this bolt
this<00:00:24.689> bolt<00:00:24.990> and<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.500> bolt<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.099> remove<00:00:26.310> the

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
this bolt and this bolt to remove the

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.070 
this bolt and this bolt to remove the
skid<00:00:26.699> plate<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.420> then<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:27.900> get<00:00:28.050> a

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
skid plate and then you can get a

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.359 
skid plate and then you can get a
crescent<00:00:28.529> wrench<00:00:28.560> or<00:00:28.859> some<00:00:29.010> other<00:00:29.160> kind<00:00:29.340> of

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
big wrench under it and just grab onto

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.659 
big wrench under it and just grab onto
it<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.410> bottom<00:00:31.710> but<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> skid<00:00:32.369> plate<00:00:32.489> is

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
it from the bottom but the skid plate is

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.430 
it from the bottom but the skid plate is
in<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:32.969> if<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.180> don't<00:00:33.360> remove<00:00:33.600> it<00:00:33.750> so

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
we're going to deal with the socket the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.250 
we're going to deal with the socket the
easy<00:00:35.880> way<00:00:36.120> you<00:00:36.540> should<00:00:36.690> watch<00:00:36.840> this<00:00:37.050> whole

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
I've put a drain pan underneath the bike

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.700 
I've put a drain pan underneath the bike
and<00:00:59.879> then<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.059> put<00:01:00.239> foil<00:01:00.600> over<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.020> frame<00:01:01.410> rails

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
drain pan and gets to socket wrench on

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.480 
drain pan and gets to socket wrench on
it<00:01:12.740> turn<00:01:13.740> it<00:01:14.070> counterclockwise<00:01:18.979> yeah<00:01:19.979> there

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
it turn it counterclockwise yeah there

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.719 
it turn it counterclockwise yeah there
goes<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.790> oil<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:22.799> plug<00:01:22.979> comes<00:01:23.250> off<00:01:23.460> and

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
goes the oil the plug comes off and

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.039 
goes the oil the plug comes off and
there's<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.909> spring<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:24.689> that<00:01:24.810> we<00:01:24.900> want

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
there's a spring in there that we want

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.080 
there's a spring in there that we want
to<00:01:25.110> return<00:01:25.500> back<00:01:25.770> when<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:26.759> put<00:01:26.909> it<00:01:26.970> back

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
to return back when we put it back

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.810 
to return back when we put it back
together<00:01:29.540> that<00:01:30.540> was<00:01:30.720> pretty<00:01:30.930> dirty<00:01:31.670> if<00:01:32.670> we

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
together that was pretty dirty if we

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.730 
together that was pretty dirty if we
look<00:01:33.030> inside<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.540> hole<00:01:33.840> this<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.259> what<00:01:34.560> passes

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
look inside the hole this is what passes

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.090 
look inside the hole this is what passes
for<00:01:35.189> an<00:01:35.340> oil<00:01:35.659> filter<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.869> this<00:01:37.590> little<00:01:37.890> gauze

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
for an oil filter is this little gauze

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.240 
for an oil filter is this little gauze
screen<00:01:39.200> here<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.350> you<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.590> want<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.860> check<00:01:41.070> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
screen here so you just want to check it

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.550 
screen here so you just want to check it
make<00:01:41.430> sure<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:41.729> clean<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.810> take<00:01:43.259> out<00:01:43.409> any

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
make sure it's clean and take out any

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.550 
make sure it's clean and take out any
chunks<00:01:44.570> what's<00:01:45.570> neat<00:01:45.750> about<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.079> design<00:01:46.380> of

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
chunks what's neat about the design of

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.109 
chunks what's neat about the design of
this<00:01:46.649> bike<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.159> was<00:01:47.280> designed<00:01:47.579> to<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.759> super

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
this bike it was designed to be super

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.260 
this bike it was designed to be super
cheap<00:01:48.360> and<00:01:48.570> easy<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.780> maintain<00:01:49.850> of<00:01:50.850> course<00:01:51.119> if

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
cheap and easy to maintain of course if

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.060 
cheap and easy to maintain of course if
you<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.570> see<00:01:51.750> any<00:01:51.930> chunks<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.409> your<00:01:52.439> strainer

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
you do see any chunks in your strainer

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.010 
you do see any chunks in your strainer
that's<00:01:53.759> indication<00:01:54.450> that<00:01:54.570> there's<00:01:54.750> something

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
that's indication that there's something

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.060 
that's indication that there's something
terribly<00:01:55.140> wrong<00:01:55.380> inside<00:01:55.799> your<00:01:55.979> engine

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
terribly wrong inside your engine

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.709 
terribly wrong inside your engine
especially<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:56.939> they're<00:01:57.060> big<00:01:57.210> chunks<00:01:57.570> so

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
especially if they're big chunks so

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.569 
especially if they're big chunks so
that's<00:01:58.350> gonna<00:01:58.590> be<00:01:58.680> your<00:01:58.860> first<00:01:58.979> clue<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.430> you

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
that's gonna be your first clue that you

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.770 
that's gonna be your first clue that you
need<00:01:59.700> to<00:02:00.350> get<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.469> there<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.740> fix<00:02:01.950> something

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
need to get in there and fix something

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.969 
need to get in there and fix something
so<00:02:03.780> once<00:02:03.930> I've<00:02:04.020> cleaned<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.380> up<00:02:04.619> you've<00:02:04.950> got

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
so once I've cleaned that up you've got

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.639 
so once I've cleaned that up you've got
the<00:02:05.219> filler<00:02:05.430> cap<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.939> spring<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:07.259> filter

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
the filler cap the spring and the filter

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.460 
the filler cap the spring and the filter
and<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.280> take<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.670> whole<00:02:08.849> apparatus<00:02:09.470> shove

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and you take that whole apparatus shove

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.920 
and you take that whole apparatus shove
it<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.800> hole<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
it in the hole and

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.530 
it in the hole and
and<00:02:12.019> torque<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.739> down<00:02:12.799> to<00:02:13.310> eleven<00:02:13.849> foot-pounds

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
and torque it down to eleven foot-pounds

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.699 
and torque it down to eleven foot-pounds
I've<00:02:14.629> read<00:02:14.810> some<00:02:15.019> people<00:02:15.290> that<00:02:15.379> have<00:02:15.560> said

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
I've read some people that have said

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.199 
I've read some people that have said
they<00:02:15.739> do<00:02:15.920> it<00:02:16.159> to<00:02:16.280> 15<00:02:16.640> foot-pounds<00:02:16.879> of<00:02:17.150> torque

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
they do it to 15 foot-pounds of torque

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:18.849 
they do it to 15 foot-pounds of torque
this<00:02:17.780> is<00:02:17.930> one<00:02:18.079> of<00:02:18.140> those<00:02:18.230> important<00:02:18.769> things

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:18.859 
this is one of those important things

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:21.190 
this is one of those important things
that<00:02:19.280> you<00:02:19.430> don't<00:02:19.549> want<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.819> screw<00:02:20.090> up<00:02:20.200> it's

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
that you don't want to screw up it's

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.509 
that you don't want to screw up it's
good<00:02:21.439> if<00:02:21.530> you<00:02:21.650> have<00:02:21.799> a<00:02:21.829> torque<00:02:22.099> wrench<00:02:22.280> because

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
good if you have a torque wrench because

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.039 
good if you have a torque wrench because
you<00:02:22.760> don't<00:02:22.939> want<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.239> put<00:02:23.359> too<00:02:23.480> much<00:02:23.510> torque<00:02:23.840> on

you don't want to put too much torque on

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:25.959 
you don't want to put too much torque on
it<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.319> rip<00:02:24.500> the<00:02:24.709> threads<00:02:24.980> out<00:02:25.129> if<00:02:25.670> you<00:02:25.819> have

that<00:02:31.459> on<00:02:31.609> my<00:02:31.760> other<00:02:31.879> bike<00:02:32.150> all<00:02:33.139> right<00:02:33.290> there<00:02:33.530> we

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
that on my other bike all right there we

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.240 
that on my other bike all right there we
go<00:02:33.879> get<00:02:34.879> in<00:02:35.180> your<00:02:35.900> hole<00:02:36.260> so<00:02:36.650> we<00:02:36.799> just<00:02:36.980> put<00:02:37.159> it

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
go get in your hole so we just put it

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.309 
go get in your hole so we just put it
all<00:02:37.400> together<00:02:37.609> in<00:02:38.000> there<00:02:38.180> as<00:02:38.299> a<00:02:38.329> unit<00:02:38.689> and<00:02:38.870> just

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
all together in there as a unit and just

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.599 
all together in there as a unit and just
make<00:02:39.500> sure<00:02:39.530> as<00:02:39.799> you're<00:02:39.920> watching<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.310> go<00:02:40.459> in

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
make sure as you're watching it go in

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:41.890 
make sure as you're watching it go in
that<00:02:40.760> everything<00:02:41.000> looks<00:02:41.329> like<00:02:41.480> it<00:02:41.659> went<00:02:41.719> in

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
that everything looks like it went in

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.770 
that everything looks like it went in
smooth<00:02:42.970> all<00:02:43.970> right<00:02:44.120> then<00:02:44.269> I<00:02:44.359> just<00:02:44.389> finished

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
smooth all right then I just finished

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:45.909 
smooth all right then I just finished
the<00:02:44.870> job<00:02:45.019> off<00:02:45.230> with<00:02:45.439> the<00:02:45.560> torque<00:02:45.739> wrench

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:45.919 
the job off with the torque wrench

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:51.300 
the job off with the torque wrench
looking<00:02:46.819> for<00:02:47.739> about<00:02:48.849> 11<00:02:49.849> to<00:02:49.939> 15<00:02:50.389> foot-pounds

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
looking for about 11 to 15 foot-pounds

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.890 
looking for about 11 to 15 foot-pounds
all<00:02:52.310> right<00:02:52.549> then<00:02:53.150> on<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.389> other<00:02:53.540> side<00:02:53.689> of<00:02:53.720> the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
all right then on the other side of the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.860 
all right then on the other side of the
bike<00:02:54.049> I've<00:02:54.230> made<00:02:54.379> a<00:02:54.409> hideous<00:02:55.099> funnel<00:02:55.970> out<00:02:56.120> of

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
bike I've made a hideous funnel out of

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.959 
bike I've made a hideous funnel out of
oil<00:02:56.989> but<00:02:57.439> it<00:02:57.560> works<00:02:57.769> I<00:02:58.219> couldn't<00:02:58.730> find<00:02:58.849> my

00:02:58.959 --> 00:02:58.969 
oil but it works I couldn't find my

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:01.990 
oil but it works I couldn't find my
regular<00:02:59.299> funnel<00:02:59.629> so<00:03:00.049> you<00:03:00.079> want<00:03:00.319> to<00:03:00.409> put<00:03:01.010> oil<00:03:01.669> in

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000 
regular funnel so you want to put oil in

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.729 
regular funnel so you want to put oil in
it<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.450> takes<00:03:02.659> a<00:03:02.750> little<00:03:02.900> more<00:03:03.019> than<00:03:03.169> a<00:03:03.349> quart

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
it it takes a little more than a quart

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.440 
it it takes a little more than a quart
so<00:03:04.310> I<00:03:04.340> would<00:03:04.459> recommend<00:03:04.790> putting<00:03:04.879> a<00:03:05.060> cord<00:03:05.299> in

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
so I would recommend putting a cord in

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.849 
so I would recommend putting a cord in
it<00:03:05.569> and<00:03:05.719> then<00:03:05.810> firing<00:03:06.139> it<00:03:06.230> up<00:03:06.290> and<00:03:06.500> letting<00:03:06.739> the

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
it and then firing it up and letting the

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.490

screw this part up so the way you check
it<00:03:30.889> is<00:03:30.979> you<00:03:31.099> put<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.459> dipstick<00:03:32.180> in<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.870> then

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
it is you put the dipstick in and then

it is you put the dipstick in and then
you<00:03:33.139> don't<00:03:33.530> screw<00:03:33.919> it<00:03:33.949> down<00:03:34.220> you<00:03:34.400> just<00:03:34.430> put<00:03:34.790> it

it's about a quarter of an inch sticking
out<00:03:39.680> of<00:03:39.799> the<00:03:39.889> hole<00:03:40.069> a<00:03:40.340> lot<00:03:40.549> of<00:03:40.669> people<00:03:40.879> will

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
out of the hole a lot of people will

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:41.979 
out of the hole a lot of people will
screw<00:03:41.150> it<00:03:41.209> all<00:03:41.299> the<00:03:41.389> way<00:03:41.449> down<00:03:41.599> to<00:03:41.780> check<00:03:41.959> the

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
screw it all the way down to check the

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.420 
screw it all the way down to check the
oil<00:03:42.109> level<00:03:42.319> and<00:03:42.650> then<00:03:42.739> the<00:03:42.859> oil<00:03:43.069> level<00:03:43.310> is

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
oil level and then the oil level is

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.490 
oil level and then the oil level is
always<00:03:43.699> low<00:03:43.939> I<00:03:44.209> have<00:03:44.720> two<00:03:44.989> Honda's<00:03:45.349> and

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:45.500 
always low I have two Honda's and

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.960 
always low I have two Honda's and
they're<00:03:45.590> both<00:03:45.709> like<00:03:45.769> this<00:03:46.159> so<00:03:46.579> you<00:03:46.639> put<00:03:46.879> the

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:46.970 
they're both like this so you put the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:48.490 
they're both like this so you put the
dipstick<00:03:47.209> in<00:03:47.419> like<00:03:47.569> that<00:03:47.780> stand<00:03:48.199> the<00:03:48.349> bike

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
dipstick in like that stand the bike

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.809 
dipstick in like that stand the bike
upright<00:03:48.979> and<00:03:49.430> then<00:03:50.419> pull<00:03:51.409> it<00:03:51.590> out<00:03:51.739> and<00:03:52.069> check

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
upright and then pull it out and check

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.280 
upright and then pull it out and check
the<00:03:52.970> level<00:03:53.120> on<00:03:53.359> the<00:03:53.479> stick<00:03:53.720> and<00:03:53.750> if<00:03:54.019> it's<00:03:54.169> at

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
the level on the stick and if it's at

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.699 
the level on the stick and if it's at
the<00:03:54.409> full<00:03:54.620> line<00:03:54.829> then<00:03:55.310> you're<00:03:55.489> good
