00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.350 

I<00:01:14.090> heard<00:01:15.090> this<00:01:16.020> is<00:01:16.350> as<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.829> feared<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.759> must<00:01:18.090> get

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
I heard this is as we feared we must get

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.060 
I heard this is as we feared we must get
into<00:01:18.509> those<00:01:18.750> catacombs<00:01:19.170> before<00:01:19.649> that<00:01:19.799> ship

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
into those catacombs before that ship

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.840 
into those catacombs before that ship
reaches<00:01:20.460> this<00:01:20.610> planet<00:01:22.310> we<00:01:23.310> had<00:01:23.429> a<00:01:23.460> big<00:01:23.700> one

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
reaches this planet we had a big one

reaches this planet we had a big one
this<00:01:24.030> time<00:01:24.299> Jack<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:25.229> decoder<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.829> found

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
this time Jack that decoder you found

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.069 
this time Jack that decoder you found
helped<00:01:26.640> us<00:01:26.759> decipher<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.329> gate<00:01:27.509> key<00:01:27.780> for<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
helped us decipher the gate key for the

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.469 
helped us decipher the gate key for the
main<00:01:28.289> cagey<00:01:28.590> war<00:01:29.009> factory<00:01:29.520> we<00:01:30.060> can<00:01:30.090> get<00:01:30.360> inside

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
main cagey war factory we can get inside

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.660 
main cagey war factory we can get inside
now<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.289> we<00:01:31.500> need<00:01:31.590> our<00:01:31.740> best<00:01:31.979> people<00:01:32.460> on<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
now and we need our best people on the

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.450 
now and we need our best people on the
raid<00:01:32.850> okay<00:01:33.810> I<00:01:34.079> wonder<00:01:34.649> who<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:34.979> might<00:01:35.219> be

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
raid okay I wonder who that might be

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.700 
raid okay I wonder who that might be
there<00:01:35.969> is<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.149> good<00:01:36.390> chance<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.929> factory<00:01:37.560> is

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
there is a good chance that factory is

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.889 
there is a good chance that factory is
doing<00:01:37.979> more<00:01:38.219> than<00:01:38.460> just<00:01:38.520> making<00:01:38.909> death<00:01:39.270> once<00:01:39.539> I

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:39.899 
doing more than just making death once I

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:41.809 
doing more than just making death once I
want<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> know<00:01:40.469> who's<00:01:40.770> behind<00:01:41.219> it<00:01:41.429> all

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
how are so many death blocks being made

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.960 
how are so many death blocks being made
where<00:01:43.979> are<00:01:44.130> they<00:01:44.220> getting<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.549> supplies<00:01:44.939> in

ball pods the only other thing is they

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:42.450 
ball pods the only other thing is they
don't<00:03:41.440> really<00:03:41.590> have<00:03:41.830> that<00:03:41.890> good<00:03:42.190> range
