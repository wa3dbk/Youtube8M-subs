00:00:00.786 --> 00:00:04.853
 And now I will tell you how you can apply knowledge of complementary colors. 

00:00:05.946 --> 00:00:08.493
 Usually our lighting is not white, but some kind of color. 

00:00:08.626 --> 00:00:12.373
 For example, in this case we have blue light. 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.453
 And what happens? 

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:21.506
 Those surfaces that are illuminated by this blue light, they turn blue. 

00:00:22.613 --> 00:00:26.493
 And those places where the blue light almost does not fall, 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.866
 that is, these are some shadows, shadow areas and shadows falling. 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.933
 They remain gray. 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.680
 But what happens? It turns out such a situation in which 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.373
 we see gray spots surrounded by blue. 

00:00:43.586 --> 00:00:48.360
 And accordingly, when we look at them with our own eyes, 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.826
 these shadow areas, these gray spots, they are painted in an additional color. 

00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:57.333
 As it were painted, we perceive them so painted in an additional color. 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.880
 That is, in this case, when we have blue lighting, 

00:01:01.373 --> 00:01:04.920
 and all the illuminated surfaces become bluish, 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.960
 then the shadow surfaces of us get an orange tint when we look at them. 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.080
 Our vision mechanisms are different from camera mechanisms, 

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:22.720
 and if you look at this scene live, you can see that the shadows are painted in additional colors, 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.266
 and on the monitor it is unlikely to see. 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.466
 But you can easily check this out if you light a scene with colored light. 

00:01:32.706 --> 00:01:41.160
 To do this, you can simply take either a colored light bulb, or attach colored glass to a light bulb, or a colored piece of paper. 

00:01:42.293 --> 00:01:49.013
 And this scene is a practical application of the theory about complementary colors, which I told in one of the videos, 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.693
 when I showed you a little gray rectangle 

00:01:54.066 --> 00:01:58.066
 on a bright orange background. 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.400
 Here is the same thing. So here we have gray shadows on a blue background. 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.986
 Well, in this case, the blue background is certainly not too bright, 

00:02:07.173 --> 00:02:12.680
 But still, it is enough to see these additional shades here. 

00:02:13.706 --> 00:02:16.053
 You can also see such an interesting effect: 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.746
 here you take some picture 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.720
 look at her and think that, seemingly, everything is normal, 

00:02:23.613 --> 00:02:27.266
 like there are green trees and the sky is blue 

00:02:28.146 --> 00:02:31.986
 but the picture is kind of strange, as if it is somehow not alive or something ... 

00:02:31.986 --> 00:02:33.980
 Like some kind of dead photo. 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.026
 Take a closer look: 

00:02:36.093 --> 00:02:41.400
 Perhaps in this picture there is simply no color lighting and additional shades in the shadows. 

00:02:42.413 --> 00:02:48.840
 Conversely, when you take a picture where it is: color lighting and additional shades in the shadows, 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.200
 then it seems to you very lively and natural.
