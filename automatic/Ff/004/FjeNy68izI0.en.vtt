able to pin me with that gun ready to

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.979 
able to pin me with that gun ready to
bounce<00:02:06.110> me<00:02:06.350> there<00:02:06.650> oh<00:02:06.890> yeah<00:02:07.569> turn<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:08.750> couldn't

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:08.989 
bounce me there oh yeah turn I couldn't

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.749 
bounce me there oh yeah turn I couldn't
have<00:02:09.110> got<00:02:09.530> out<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:09.950> you<00:02:10.190> know<00:02:10.310> did<00:02:10.550> anything

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
have got out and you know did anything

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.850 
have got out and you know did anything
else<00:02:11.090> except<00:02:11.630> stayed<00:02:11.870> there<00:02:12.110> and<00:02:12.230> so<00:02:12.349> he<00:02:12.590> fired

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
else except stayed there and so he fired

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.800 
else except stayed there and so he fired
because<00:02:13.130> if<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:13.849> drove<00:02:14.209> out<00:02:14.420> he<00:02:14.630> could<00:02:14.780> have

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
because if I drove out he could have

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.540 
because if I drove out he could have
shot<00:02:14.930> on<00:02:15.260> my<00:02:15.410> flank<00:02:15.680> which<00:02:16.190> could<00:02:16.370> be

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
shot on my flank which could be

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.320 
shot on my flank which could be
disastrous<00:02:17.739> so<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:19.160> don't<00:02:19.610> really<00:02:19.790> like<00:02:20.030> the

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
disastrous so I don't really like the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.350 
disastrous so I don't really like the
easy<00:02:21.140> eight<00:02:21.470> because<00:02:21.709> of<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.580> low<00:02:22.760> pen<00:02:23.120> and

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
easy eight because of the low pen and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.479 
easy eight because of the low pen and
low<00:02:23.660> alpha<00:02:23.930> but<00:02:24.350> then<00:02:24.500> it<00:02:24.650> has<00:02:24.680> DPM<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:25.430> I

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
low alpha but then it has DPM so I

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:29.949 
low alpha but then it has DPM so I
thought<00:02:25.700> okay<00:02:26.360> let's<00:02:27.610> try<00:02:28.610> on<00:02:28.819> and<00:02:29.209> because<00:02:29.840> is

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
thought okay let's try on and because is

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.400 
thought okay let's try on and because is
a<00:02:29.989> tip<00:02:30.349> bloody<00:02:31.010> any<00:02:31.940> game<00:02:32.209> it's<00:02:32.540> hard<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:32.930> do

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
a tip bloody any game it's hard to do

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.220 
a tip bloody any game it's hard to do
