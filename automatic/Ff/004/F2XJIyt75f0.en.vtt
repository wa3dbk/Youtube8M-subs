00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:06.030
 Yes This looks cube lite monitor of Roland this time 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:09.150
 Review 

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:10.680
 I put the Yes er does not do the opening video 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.580
 Hen stinking because 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:18.869
 I bought this because I was interested a little , iphone and ipad 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:24.330
 It is only that can be used in the ipod touch 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:31.000
 Yes So you body Tot inspector're entering I'm not used in windows 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:33.570
 This is the back It 's very simple It's the microphone and line input jacks 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.699
 Condenser microphone can not be used 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.960
 It's a volume here later and it's a head warm stone and a switch . 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:44.290
 It is the place of that power adapter 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:47.079
 I see here but this is a screw 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:51.640
 It is not a relationship switch 

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:57.210
 After this is the volume and this is the switch I see 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:01:01.950
 And this is it there is a low and medium and lungs 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:08.790
 In Well and after the sword equalizer like a feeling I this is reverb 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:13.440
 Saying become a reverb and reverb and echo I This is the way here and has become 0 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.920
 It feels like going to this side and going to be after that The making of Roland is already the same as this 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.470
 Ne 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.980
 High 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:23.240
 Yes i feel like this 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.240
 Yes this is the front I 'm not so big Width is 20 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.520
 4 cm or 5 cm 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.830
 The vertical one is 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.790
 During ~ 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.940
 Is it about 3 to 4 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.840
 So many songs with this feeling 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.400
 No depth 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.460
 I 'm going 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:47.980
 And about 14 cm 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:54.460
 Is about 4 centimeters in even in the most wide Toko 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:02:00.620
 Yes then connect power action and iphone and ipad 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.659
 It is a life to be connected, but there are 3 because this is standing 3 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.020
 Here of ie 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:10.259
 This one 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:14.590
 Insert it into the earphone jack and put it in the place called iqube link 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:15.500
 Entered when you turn Yes it does not contain 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.830
 To 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.030
 later 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:24.640
 Launch wiring software 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:24.640
 If you do this, you will receive a response 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.860
 Entered was 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:33.480
 I 'll get back a little, but it's the Speaker Grande a bit. 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.480
 It is a creative explanation 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.780
 It is a considerable application 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.780
 me 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.910
 By fireworks 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.910
 me 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.890
 This is a stop- 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.890
 Waken am I this it impossible Ya Do not software or the like cube jam 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.190
 I 'm over 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.350
 The interesting part of 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:13.340
 It is here here sprout 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:17.880
 But it is not possible to specify the playback speed 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:21.960
 This is really 100% of normal 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.830
 Up to 150% if you want to go fast 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.830
 I now 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.830
 It says that after can be a slow sound in 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.370
 It will be a bit tough in the future 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.610
 Hey or roughly this way about 80 per 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.820
 Yup 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:56.590
 I like to style is this usage was in the copy of the 

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.590
 After that you can play the key 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:00.640
 I did my best 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.840
 Of course you can lower it 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.840
 Be reckoned 

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.840
 I understand that a 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.230
 I think speed is I'm down the pitch but I'm the same this in a normal line 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:32.230
 Hmm 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:49.120
 This is to slow down a little high speed when you Toka copy Yappa I think you play quite Ne 

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:52.270
 You can also do 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:58.080
 It is very playable It is good because this is free 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:05:02.509
 You can listen to the music of iphone so there is a problem with playing music 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.509
 Hey this is my original 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:20.520
 So you can of course also use it as a speaker 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:24.120
 How was it? I thought it was about the grade of Noland 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:30.449
 I think it can be used as a mini amp 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:35.789
 Sound molecule maa basically that iphone ipad ipod touch 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:39.449
 I Nde's is ordinary jack I'd basic usage that in Well connected 

00:05:35.789 --> 00:05:41.060
 I can not use a condenser microphone that I think can be used 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:45.500
 After 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:46.090
 You can download a software called cube jam free of charge, so in that 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.860
 What 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:53.770
 Because of moving the house to the middle Once you have this in another stereo that vocal canceller 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:59.110
 There is also a feature that you can put on clothes in the middle of migration . 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:06:01.480
 Meant that it 's such whether Hey Hey It's try using after I do not use 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:07.360
 For example 

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:11.620
 It was there is that behind the operation Gachotto tricky unless you use them to this kind of wind 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.670
 Why stylish it might have this emphasis on appearance 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.480
 I have another pillar 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:24.230
 When you do it after all this at hand when guitarist Toka operation 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:27.710
 Guitar Well at an affordable price but there was is that a little difficult and is attached to the back 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:33.410
 I also do keyboard vocals with 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:36.530
 I think that there is a function that is enough for the Minare department . 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:42.380
 Desukeredo This is it is is to press laid the Ano 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:46.130
 Music production and guitar with iphone and ipad ipod touch 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:47.700
 It is already highly recommended for those who want to do it 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:48.330
 Just for me 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:54.270
 The 

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:59.870
 A substantial say the music is 0 jeans degree of ipad is at the stage where I thought I try to use this 

00:06:54.270 --> 00:07:05.150
 I thought that I would use it and try to make music, so I did this 

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:08.870
 I have a macbook air so I will try to go there 

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:10.180
 It is macbook air and this is not supported for Mac 

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:14.190
 So 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:18.330
 I'm thinking about it a little now 

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:20.740
 ipad and mac you're macbook air's garageband 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.249
 Because the specifications of are different 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:27.749
 Think about that too 

00:07:23.249 --> 00:07:30.540
 Well it is that detailed a more detailed music production Well 

00:07:27.749 --> 00:07:31.950
 With respect to the go doing music constellation 

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:36.450
 Among the 

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:42.600
 It is in the mac to ipad Once was when that comes when was changed to Mac 

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:45.870
 I thought it would be better if it had been done , now it is obtained and it is the mac version with the ground 

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:47.050
 We believe now that say trying to do 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:51.240
 By say 

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:55.840
 If iphone or ipad is really recommended this all , hey 

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:59.410
 At the time of the garage band Toka various music gender differences in the future 

00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:03.010
 Audio interface will be the teeth because this is recommended 

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:04.660
 That's right this time for Roland's cube lite monitor 

00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:07.650
 It was a review 

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:07.650
 Yes then again
