00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
first barrels are generally made of

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.080 
first barrels are generally made of
African<00:00:27.480> Blackwood<00:00:27.720> or<00:00:28.619> cocobolo<00:00:29.099> there's

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
African Blackwood or cocobolo there's

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.540 
African Blackwood or cocobolo there's
other<00:00:30.920> materials<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.009> they're<00:00:32.250> made<00:00:32.369> out<00:00:32.399> of

other materials that they're made out of
exotic<00:00:33.120> woods<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:34.430> the<00:00:35.430> exotic<00:00:35.910> woods<00:00:36.120> tend

exotic woods but the exotic woods tend

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.750 
exotic woods but the exotic woods tend
to<00:00:36.660> be<00:00:36.780> softer<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.590> tend<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:38.010> change<00:00:38.190> too<00:00:38.550> much

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
to be softer and tend to change too much

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.650 
to be softer and tend to change too much
over<00:00:39.239> time<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:40.040> don't<00:00:41.040> stay<00:00:41.309> stable<00:00:42.090> most

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
over time and don't stay stable most

over time and don't stay stable most
clarinet<00:00:43.020> players<00:00:43.260> use<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.680> Blackwood

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
clarinet players use the Blackwood

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.100 
clarinet players use the Blackwood
barrel<00:00:44.399> though<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.059> believe<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.899> every

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
barrel though I believe that every

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.810 
barrel though I believe that every
clarinet<00:00:46.590> player<00:00:46.770> should<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> Blackwood

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
clarinet player should have a Blackwood

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.569 
clarinet player should have a Blackwood
and<00:00:48.030> a<00:00:48.239> cocoa<00:00:48.450> bottle<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.110> their<00:00:49.440> case<00:00:49.649> the

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and a cocoa bottle in their case the

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.090 
and a cocoa bottle in their case the
cocoa<00:00:50.940> bottle<00:00:51.239> has<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> warmer<00:00:51.930> sound<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.949> it

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
cocoa bottle has a warmer sound and it

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.010 
cocoa bottle has a warmer sound and it
changes<00:00:53.520> with<00:00:53.699> time<00:00:53.940> because<00:00:54.300> it's<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.570> softer

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
changes with time because it's a softer

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.290 
changes with time because it's a softer
wood<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.620> change<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.309> all<00:00:56.610> usually<00:00:56.850> all<00:00:57.270> for

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
wood the change is all usually all for

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.040 
wood the change is all usually all for
the<00:00:57.629> better<00:00:57.809> let's<00:00:58.620> talk<00:00:58.859> about<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.280> taper

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050 
the better let's talk about the taper

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.540 
the better let's talk about the taper
there<00:01:01.050> are<00:01:01.109> several<00:01:01.289> tapers<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.160> use<00:01:02.340> on

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
there are several tapers that we use on

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.820 
there are several tapers that we use on
a<00:01:02.579> barrel<00:01:02.969> one<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.080> with<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.379> top<00:01:04.559> being

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
a barrel one is with the top being

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.700 
a barrel one is with the top being
smaller<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.900> bottom<00:01:07.200> being<00:01:07.409> bigger

smaller and the bottom being bigger

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.850 
smaller and the bottom being bigger
that's<00:01:08.670> called<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.030> standard<00:01:09.479> taper<00:01:09.860> usually

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
that's called the standard taper usually

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.250 
that's called the standard taper usually
you<00:01:10.920> go<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.640> top<00:01:11.820> is<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.450> same<00:01:12.659> size<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.140> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
you go the top is the same size as the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.690 
you go the top is the same size as the
clarinet<00:01:13.619> mouthpiece<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> bottom<00:01:14.610> is

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700

the same size as the clarinet

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.160 
the same size as the clarinet
there's<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.430> reverse<00:01:17.759> taper<00:01:18.060> where<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> top

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
there's the reverse taper where the top

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.120 
there's the reverse taper where the top
is<00:01:19.409> bigger<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.670> bottom<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.150> smaller

is bigger and the bottom is smaller

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:25.429 
is bigger and the bottom is smaller
there's<00:01:23.130> also<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.970> double<00:01:24.299> taper<00:01:24.509> where

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
there's also the double taper where

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.649 
there's also the double taper where
tapers<00:01:25.860> from<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> top<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.030> middle<00:01:27.150> and

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
tapers from the top to the middle and

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.969 
tapers from the top to the middle and
then<00:01:27.900> back<00:01:28.110> out<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> bottom<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:30.030> the

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
then back out to the bottom and and the

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.740 
then back out to the bottom and and the
largest<00:01:31.979> part<00:01:32.430> could<00:01:32.610> be<00:01:32.670> either<00:01:33.030> on<00:01:33.329> the<00:01:33.540> top

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
largest part could be either on the top

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.249 
largest part could be either on the top
or<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.079> bottom<00:01:34.430> it's<00:01:35.430> also<00:01:35.729> possible<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.840> go

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
or the bottom it's also possible to go

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:42.560 
or the bottom it's also possible to go
inside<00:01:37.650> and<00:01:39.770> cut<00:01:40.770> different<00:01:41.610> parts<00:01:41.970> inside

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
inside and cut different parts inside

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.499 
inside and cut different parts inside
the<00:01:42.810> barrel<00:01:43.140> to<00:01:43.950> fix<00:01:44.189> certain<00:01:44.399> test<00:01:44.759> turns<00:01:45.270> or

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
the barrel to fix certain test turns or

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.569 
the barrel to fix certain test turns or
certain<00:01:45.930> particular<00:01:46.229> notes<00:01:46.770> on<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.130> clarinet

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
certain particular notes on the clarinet

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.730 
certain particular notes on the clarinet
so<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.390> actually<00:01:48.840> tune<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.140> clarinet

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
so you can actually tune the clarinet

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.280 
so you can actually tune the clarinet
with<00:01:49.890> your<00:01:50.040> barrel<00:01:50.399> so<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:52.140> have<00:01:52.229> a

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
with your barrel so if you have a

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.630 
with your barrel so if you have a
clarinet<00:01:52.680> that's<00:01:52.860> not<00:01:53.040> playing<00:01:53.220> quite<00:01:53.490> in

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
clarinet that's not playing quite in

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.600 
clarinet that's not playing quite in
tune<00:01:53.850> try<00:01:54.540> an<00:01:54.600> aftermarket<00:01:55.110> barrel<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.219> sit

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
tune try an aftermarket barrel and sit

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.160 
tune try an aftermarket barrel and sit
with<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> barrel<00:01:57.090> maker<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.659> see<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.049> you

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
with the barrel maker and see if you

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.080 
with the barrel maker and see if you
just<00:01:58.229> can't<00:01:58.619> make<00:01:58.799> it<00:01:58.950> better<00:01:59.100> the<00:01:59.700> outside

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
just can't make it better the outside

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.660 
just can't make it better the outside
shape<00:02:00.329> is<00:02:00.570> also<00:02:01.110> important<00:02:01.619> these<00:02:02.340> are<00:02:02.399> the

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
shape is also important these are the

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.740 
shape is also important these are the
first<00:02:02.850> two<00:02:03.799> barrels<00:02:04.799> that<00:02:05.399> my<00:02:06.180> partner<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.659> I

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
first two barrels that my partner and I

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.130 
first two barrels that my partner and I
ever<00:02:06.930> made<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.979> as<00:02:08.940> you<00:02:09.239> can<00:02:09.390> see

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.890 

quite<00:02:12.380> different<00:02:12.770> in<00:02:12.860> shape<00:02:13.240> are<00:02:14.240> later

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
quite different in shape are later

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:26.949 
quite different in shape are later
shapes<00:02:16.959> have<00:02:17.959> been<00:02:18.260> more<00:02:18.470> like<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:25.240> if<00:02:26.240> you

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
shapes have been more like this if you

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.430 
shapes have been more like this if you
look<00:02:27.200> at<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:28.010> buffet<00:02:28.430> barrel<00:02:29.050> you'll<00:02:30.050> find<00:02:30.320> that

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
look at a buffet barrel you'll find that

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.050 
look at a buffet barrel you'll find that
the<00:02:30.560> outside<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.100> barrel<00:02:31.310> is<00:02:31.610> almost

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
the outside of the barrel is almost

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.260 
the outside of the barrel is almost
perfectly<00:02:33.020> round<00:02:33.340> what<00:02:34.340> we<00:02:34.550> found<00:02:34.850> is<00:02:35.240> that

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
perfectly round what we found is that

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.590 
perfectly round what we found is that
where<00:02:35.840> the<00:02:36.020> weight<00:02:36.200> is<00:02:36.440> in<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.610> barrel<00:02:37.940> really

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
where the weight is in the barrel really

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.800 
where the weight is in the barrel really
affects<00:02:38.959> the<00:02:39.260> sound<00:02:39.709> and<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.910> intonation<00:02:41.390> and

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
affects the sound and the intonation and

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.430 
affects the sound and the intonation and
the<00:02:42.050> feel<00:02:42.260> of<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.560> barrel<00:02:42.890> so<00:02:43.930> we<00:02:44.930> like<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.170> put

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
the feel of the barrel so we like to put

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.900 
the feel of the barrel so we like to put
a<00:02:45.470> little<00:02:45.680> bit<00:02:45.830> more<00:02:46.010> weight<00:02:46.190> on<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.730> bottom

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
a little bit more weight on the bottom

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.080 
a little bit more weight on the bottom
we<00:02:47.600> think<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:47.930> makes<00:02:48.080> a<00:02:48.320> lot<00:02:48.350> of<00:02:48.620> difference

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
we think it makes a lot of difference

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.610 
we think it makes a lot of difference
with<00:02:50.090> the<00:02:50.239> barrels<00:02:50.600> of<00:02:50.870> all<00:02:51.110> the<00:02:51.260> people<00:02:51.530> that

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
with the barrels of all the people that

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.680 
with the barrels of all the people that
have<00:02:51.769> tried<00:02:51.950> our<00:02:52.130> barrels<00:02:52.519> I<00:02:52.760> think<00:02:53.510> maybe

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
have tried our barrels I think maybe

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:55.570 
have tried our barrels I think maybe
only<00:02:53.959> two<00:02:54.290> or<00:02:54.440> three<00:02:54.470> people<00:02:54.830> haven't<00:02:55.370> bought

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
only two or three people haven't bought

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.300 
only two or three people haven't bought
them<00:02:55.850> and<00:02:56.230> they<00:02:57.230> seem<00:02:57.410> to<00:02:57.530> be<00:02:57.650> very<00:02:57.769> popular

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
them and they seem to be very popular

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.690 
them and they seem to be very popular
because<00:02:58.459> of<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:59.290> so<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.410> shape<00:03:00.650> matters<00:03:01.010> and

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
because of that so the shape matters and

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.750 
because of that so the shape matters and
I'm<00:03:02.000> not<00:03:02.180> saying<00:03:02.860> my<00:03:03.860> barrels<00:03:04.250> are<00:03:04.400> the<00:03:04.519> only

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
I'm not saying my barrels are the only

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.100 
I'm not saying my barrels are the only
ones<00:03:04.940> to<00:03:05.060> buy<00:03:05.269> there's<00:03:05.570> plenty<00:03:05.900> of<00:03:05.930> good

barrels out there and there's plenty of

barrels out there and there's plenty of
good<00:03:08.120> barrel<00:03:08.480> makers<00:03:08.900> and<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:11.000> should<00:03:11.180> try

good barrel makers and you should try

good barrel makers and you should try

some of everybody's next thing I'd like

some of everybody's next thing I'd like
to<00:03:13.430> do<00:03:13.700> is<00:03:13.910> talk<00:03:14.540> about<00:03:14.570> bells<00:03:15.110> in<00:03:15.590> many<00:03:15.860> ways<00:03:16.070> a

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
to do is talk about bells in many ways a

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:23.800 
to do is talk about bells in many ways a
bell<00:03:16.670> is<00:03:16.970> like<00:03:17.269> a<00:03:17.680> stereo<00:03:18.680> speaker<00:03:20.739> the<00:03:22.810> size

bell is like a stereo speaker the size
and<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.799> Flair<00:03:25.100> of<00:03:25.310> the<00:03:25.430> Bell<00:03:25.690> controls<00:03:26.690> the

and the Flair of the Bell controls the

maker will bring the the bore of the

maker will bring the the bore of the
clarinet<00:03:56.299> into<00:03:56.810> the<00:03:56.930> Bell<00:03:57.110> a<00:03:57.440> certain<00:03:57.920> way<00:03:58.070> and

in that case they change you know the

whole overtone series of the clarinet

whole overtone series of the clarinet
which<00:04:04.760> makes<00:04:05.030> different<00:04:05.480> notes<00:04:05.660> more

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
which makes different notes more

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.580 
which makes different notes more
important<00:04:06.470> than<00:04:06.680> other<00:04:06.829> notes<00:04:07.840> also<00:04:08.840> there's

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
important than other notes also there's

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.370 
important than other notes also there's
the<00:04:09.769> weight<00:04:10.150> the<00:04:11.150> whole<00:04:11.329> weight<00:04:11.660> of<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.200> bell

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:15.210 
the weight the whole weight of the bell
here's<00:04:13.100> a<00:04:13.190> very<00:04:13.489> heavy<00:04:13.760> bell<00:04:14.090> you<00:04:14.720> can<00:04:14.900> see

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
here's a very heavy bell you can see

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.680 
here's a very heavy bell you can see
it's<00:04:16.220> got<00:04:16.400> a<00:04:16.669> thick<00:04:17.090> bottom<00:04:19.150> it's<00:04:20.150> got<00:04:20.299> a<00:04:20.359> thick

it's got a thick bottom it's got a thick

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.840 
it's got a thick bottom it's got a thick
middle<00:04:21.229> and<00:04:21.620> it's<00:04:21.799> got<00:04:21.979> a<00:04:22.010> thick<00:04:22.310> top

middle and it's got a thick top
it's<00:04:23.480> very<00:04:23.780> heavy<00:04:24.140> in<00:04:24.500> my<00:04:24.680> hand<00:04:27.220> here's

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
it's very heavy in my hand here's

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.890 
it's very heavy in my hand here's
another<00:04:28.550> one<00:04:28.820> a<00:04:29.260> little<00:04:30.260> lighter<00:04:30.770> I<00:04:31.900> could

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
another one a little lighter I could

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.380 
another one a little lighter I could
feel<00:04:33.080> it<00:04:33.200> in<00:04:33.290> my<00:04:33.440> hand<00:04:33.650> and<00:04:34.060> here's<00:04:35.060> the<00:04:35.240> one<00:04:35.360> I

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:35.390 
feel it in my hand and here's the one I

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
feel it in my hand and here's the one I
use<00:04:35.690> it's<00:04:36.020> very<00:04:36.110> light<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:38.110> it's<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.230> little

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:39.410 
use it's very light and it's a little

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.800 
use it's very light and it's a little
shorter<00:04:39.890> than<00:04:39.920> most<00:04:40.220> barrels<00:04:40.640> and<00:04:40.880> we<00:04:40.910> did

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:41.810 
shorter than most barrels and we did

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.050 
shorter than most barrels and we did
that<00:04:41.960> because<00:04:42.260> it<00:04:42.290> might<00:04:42.560> be<00:04:42.800> my<00:04:43.430> middle<00:04:43.610> B<00:04:43.880> is

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
that because it might be my middle B is

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.280 
that because it might be my middle B is
a<00:04:44.090> little<00:04:44.510> flat<00:04:45.160> so<00:04:46.160> that<00:04:46.190> helps<00:04:46.640> to<00:04:46.790> be<00:04:46.910> a<00:04:46.940> lot

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:47.290 
a little flat so that helps to be a lot

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.490 
a little flat so that helps to be a lot
and<00:04:48.290> also<00:04:49.150> its<00:04:50.150> lightness<00:04:50.750> makes<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.230> sound

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
and also its lightness makes the sound

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.080 
and also its lightness makes the sound
very<00:04:51.860> centred<00:04:52.400> everybody<00:04:52.820> that's<00:04:52.970> played
