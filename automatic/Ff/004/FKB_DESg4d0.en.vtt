00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.960
 you are alone with you the hemisphere are 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.170
 rhythms will hurt and you will get rid of 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.470
 medium 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.270
 in this video I will teach how we are going to 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.400
 to be able to get rid of all those cars 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:19.220
 disgusting that both ass go and not 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.810
 they let us do any tricks with him already 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.130
 either because they are from a very 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.619
 old because we have failed doing 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.510
 other tricks for whatever it is with this 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.060
 trick we will not be able to undo all 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.080
 those disgusting cars &amp; is that not 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.120
 we can do nothing with them 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.079
 we are not going to cover that yes but good 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.359
 At least we 'll get him a hundred and a half 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.609
 that never even more for a car with 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:41.949
 the one that we could not do anything the only 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:45.039
 what we should do for the trick are 

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:48.429
 very simple steps is to ride in 

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:52.390
 the car that we want to sell we will buy 

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:55.030
 a revel having the garage full and the 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.460
 we will substitute the car in which 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.550
 we are mounted that is the car with 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.160
 what are we going to do the trick 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.550
 once we buy it we simply have 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.830
 to wait in the garage to see what 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.970
 we received the message that we have already 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.000
 received the network 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.250
 once we receive that simple message and 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.070
 we will have to go to the saints 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.800
 fair and sell the car 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.900
 he'll let us sell it and we'll get out 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.090
 I already told you in a hundred and some 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.300
 fifty depends on the car you are a 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.700
 cheap car to give a fortune but 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.890
 At least we can get rid of 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.570
 those cars taking out is something of benefit 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.640
 and not having to simply change them 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.950
 and lose everything we have paid for 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.630
 it's better and so on so nothing 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.900
