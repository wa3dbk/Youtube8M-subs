00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.710
 hello through this new video 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.760
 tutorial we will show you how to load 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:12.460
 voice to gps garmin through the 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.320
 program poi loader 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.360
 first of all we must lower the 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.560
 program point loader of the page of 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.699
 garmin 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.699
 for this we enter the garmin page 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.699
 dot com 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.720
 and we look for the game loader 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.250
 we search where Carmen paulo agar says 

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:38.250
 for windows 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:44.330
 and we press 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.330
 download 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.100
 and we download it 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:55.460
 once the download is complete 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.460
 we proceed to the installation of it 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.200
 we double click on the program and 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.200
 the installation begins 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:09.050
 We do next we accept 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.970
 following 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.120
 and we wait for the completion of the 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.120
 installation 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.560
 once the installation of 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.770
 we explain initial power now 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.409
 and we finished 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.679
 the next step is to copy the program 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:33.929
 socks exc in the folder where it was installed 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:36.320
 the power for that we open the cip of the 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:40.940
 boys 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:43.420
 and seek sox exe file and 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.420
 we extract 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.330
 then we copy the shots file 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.890
 and we paste it in the folder where it 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.890
 installed the point loader program 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.870
 this step is essential for 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.420
 copy the sound files when 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.479
 let's get the poys to the gps 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.780
 then we connect our gps to the 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.440
 computer and we run the program 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:17.380
 I can speak we do next 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:20.800
 next garmin device and we tackle 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.110
 that our gps is selected 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.800
 If our gps will not be selected 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.530
 we must press the search button 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.550
 device 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.780
 We do next install new ones 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:34.780
 personalized next 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:45.209
 and here we must in this field select 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:48.450
 the folder where we previously processed 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.610
 the poys with the boy selector program 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:55.160
 we had done it in the video 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:59.790
 previous then we should put a name 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:02.459
 to the file that will be generated and copy hps 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.530
 usually this file is put 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.109
 the name I go but it can take 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.840
 any name the only thing we have 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:12.569
 that being very careful is always 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.519
 by the same name because if they do not go to 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:17.489
 be duplicated with the version 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:20.819
 previous that we have later here 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:24.209
 we select meters and kilometers and the 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.720
 express mode so that it automatically 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.060
 generate the speed alerts 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:32.849
 we do next here let me know that 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.599
 I have a file with the same name in 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:38.720
 the gps confirmed yes and the 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.720
 installation 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.730
 we wait for it to end 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:48.500
 Once finished , it will indicate 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.510
 how many pois were installed in this case 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:55.070
 as in our previous selection 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:58.430
 we had installed 12,291 because we have 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:01.940
 to keep in mind not to load the gps 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.090
 with more than this amount the limit would be 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:09.310
 15,000 so that the embarrassment is not given 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:13.709
 of polis good we passed 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.709
 And that's all, thank you
