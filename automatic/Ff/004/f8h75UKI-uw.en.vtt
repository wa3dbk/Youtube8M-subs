00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
team one of the major improvements and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.319 
team one of the major improvements and
the<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.610> you'll<00:00:32.730> probably<00:00:33.090> notice

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
the one that you'll probably notice

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.360 
the one that you'll probably notice
first<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> brand<00:00:34.440> new<00:00:34.590> physics<00:00:35.010> engine

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
first is the brand new physics engine

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.790 
first is the brand new physics engine
this<00:00:36.360> means<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:36.809> ball<00:00:37.079> now<00:00:37.290> moves<00:00:37.530> more

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
this means that the ball now moves more

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.920 
this means that the ball now moves more
realistically<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.730> performs<00:00:39.420> differently

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
realistically and performs differently

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
on different playing surfaces the ball

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.970 
on different playing surfaces the ball
also<00:00:42.239> curves<00:00:42.719> better<00:00:43.050> when<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.469> passed<00:00:43.710> and

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
also curves better when it's passed and

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.799 
also curves better when it's passed and
crossed<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.910> players<00:00:45.120> react<00:00:45.540> to<00:00:45.690> its

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
crossed and the players react to its

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.290 
crossed and the players react to its
movement<00:00:46.290> in<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.500> more<00:00:46.649> natural<00:00:47.040> way<00:00:47.300> you'll

movement in a more natural way you'll
also<00:00:48.480> notice<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.320> ball<00:00:49.500> reacts<00:00:49.829> more

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
also notice that the ball reacts more

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.040 
also notice that the ball reacts more
realistically<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.910> external<00:00:51.480> influences

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
