00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 hello guys welcome to a new one 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:08.550
 unboxing today we will discard together that 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.530
 burning full and see what this is 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.849
 is my first ps4 game and vi 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.639
 I remember this exclusive video 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.510
 for bit world games 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:21.869
 so let's see the packaging is 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.699
 the general aesthetics of the chosen for the 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.539
 ps4 cases then this is the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.240
 cute cover the beautiful ps4 logo 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.090
 great in evidence only on playstation 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.559
 obviously we are talking about an exclusive of 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.309
 absolute quality 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:42.750
 this is the back of the cover to be noted 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.600
 that there are as many as 40 gigabytes of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.320
 installation because it is not much 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.360
 funny but unfortunately so it is so 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.899
 the defect of the new games because if 4 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.670
 needing an installation 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.989
 really susa so we are an average 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.410
 from 25 to 40 50 of cabaye however it 's fine 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:13.080
 so 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:16.159
 we discard the game and make it there 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:22.740
 they want strong manners 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:27.650
 here we go to see a little sorry 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:33.320
 I tell you that surely there is very little 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.320
 the maize took this bad habit 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:45.050
 let's try 8 the paper seal here 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:49.560
 what is the 50 gigabyte blue ray disc 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:53.040
 season pass this would be season pass 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.900
 19 99 in practice contains the packs of 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.700
 trepak cooperative expansion of maps 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.100
 online cooperatives two additional parts 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.810
 expansion multiplayer mode 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.530
 various bonus items then classic 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.350
 season pass of all shooters 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.500
 also available for ps3 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.380
 here is this leaflet ago 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:16.500
 see how the operation works 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.750
 of 24 with killzone shadow full then 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.480
 we have to see here in motion 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:26.340
 launches melee zoom 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.650
 we say that as you will have understood not 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.540
 the manual no longer exists so this is it 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:37.130
 no bad manuals now 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:43.560
 bulletin for information on the pad 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:47.370
 and then just the classic is advertising 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:50.190
 disk is identical to a ps3 with the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.440
 the only difference between the words ps4 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.420
 so we see a comparison with a 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.130
 title playstation 3 old series 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.630
 the one with the ps3 logo these are is 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:06.030
 was the first ps3 cover with the logo 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.830
 particular effect the archite 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.560
 playstation 3 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:14.570
 so as dimensions I would say they are 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.570
 absolutely identical 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:22.379
 and nothing that's all a greeting 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:26.370
 I remember this is dedicated to this 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:30.120
 unboxing a edward games and coming soon 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.569
 we will see in detail the dualshock 4 hello 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.569
 boys
