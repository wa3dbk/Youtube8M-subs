00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.790
 between January next to the naval base of 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.680
 broken of the oppressive state here we have a 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.720
 piece of fumigated way you can see how 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.480
 the contours are the skies of the 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:15.049
 zones for nothing I will think about fixing 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:18.580
 that trace you will not even think 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.500
 that these are normal heavens 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.090
 these are simply in the moments that 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.210
 remain of the fumigations and even when 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:28.180
 The sun baena will return to its sole in spite 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:30.520
 that anyone who knows anything 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.379
 of meteorology anybody who 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.080
 ask an old man of the place will tell you 

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:36.250
 this winds of water has gotten us the 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.720
 east wind three or four 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.250
 days but we have been changed by a 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.080
 wind that is currently carried 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.790
 a long blanket 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.290
 She is fresh and you can see that 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.870
 from anyone who asks but the 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:47.550
 water where is 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.850
 our water looks back there those 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:53.890
 cables you have an attempt to deform a 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.480
 nubecita is a tiny lenticular 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:00.370
 but it will not form and it will rain and there 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.900
 you have the rest of the sky where it is still 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.610
 more obvious 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.780
 yesterday I posted a video where it was exhibited 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.520
 in the studio is a kid of the 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.170
 University of Seville with some data 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.450
 quite interesting and others of a 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.100
 chain to the chain be that also 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.350
 he talked about the fumigation of dioxide 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.090
 Diatomite lead good to nobody 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.220
 surprise that they fumigate lead dioxide 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.360
 when they are fumigating several strontium 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.780
 biases rivers and all kinds of mills 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.490
 nanotechnological the both pigs 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.340
 so that might be a fake but 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:35.830
 I was goodbye to report a little fake bad 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.450
 Indeed if that be for here 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.820
 we leave it lady and we have the bridge 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.220
 which is becoming the expensive work 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.500
 through here of cÃ¡diz that is us 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.840
 costing and has almost tripled their 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.550
 budgets or quadrupling their 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.260
 budgets takes years of delay 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.200
 and they still sell us, which is the 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.600
 reverse wonder good sir here what 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.340
 we leave is a cock like a pot that 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.610
 Masonic signs more beautiful has 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.980
 true 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.140
 here we leave you gentlemen as I said together 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.350
 to the naval base of broken defeat of 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.330
 hello struts 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.020
 every blur is one more day we continue 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.020
 playing gentlemen
