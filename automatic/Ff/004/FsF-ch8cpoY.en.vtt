00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
happened back in middle school 8th grade

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.570 
happened back in middle school 8th grade
around<00:01:26.090> that<00:01:26.420> graduation<00:01:26.900> and<00:01:27.410> I<00:01:28.010> always

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
around that graduation and I always

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.880 
around that graduation and I always
thought<00:01:28.820> that<00:01:29.090> I<00:01:29.120> was<00:01:29.330> big<00:01:29.660> but<00:01:30.170> I<00:01:30.230> never<00:01:30.530> was

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
thought that I was big but I never was

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.970 
thought that I was big but I never was
and<00:01:31.340> I<00:01:31.970> just<00:01:32.180> never<00:01:32.330> felt<00:01:32.480> good<00:01:32.870> enough<00:01:32.980> so

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:33.980 
and I just never felt good enough so

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.000 
and I just never felt good enough so
that<00:01:34.490> led<00:01:35.090> myself<00:01:35.330> to<00:01:35.960> think<00:01:36.230> that<00:01:36.560> if<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:36.860> was

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:37.010 
that led myself to think that if I was

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:39.580 
that led myself to think that if I was
really<00:01:37.700> skinny<00:01:38.000> then<00:01:38.810> I'd<00:01:38.960> finally<00:01:39.200> be<00:01:39.380> good

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
really skinny then I'd finally be good

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.040 
really skinny then I'd finally be good

self-worth<00:03:33.490> I<00:03:33.850> think<00:03:34.270> that<00:03:34.480> something<00:03:34.960> really

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
self-worth I think that something really

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.260 
self-worth I think that something really
interesting<00:03:35.890> about<00:03:36.250> eating<00:03:36.640> disorders<00:03:36.760> is

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
interesting about eating disorders is

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.670 
interesting about eating disorders is
it's<00:03:37.450> almost<00:03:37.750> like<00:03:37.960> the<00:03:38.140> person<00:03:38.560> that's

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
it's almost like the person that's

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.590 
it's almost like the person that's
struggling<00:03:39.010> has<00:03:39.610> a<00:03:39.670> different<00:03:40.090> filter<00:03:40.330> in

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
struggling has a different filter in

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.930 
struggling has a different filter in
their<00:03:40.750> head<00:03:40.930> so<00:03:41.140> when<00:03:42.040> someone<00:03:42.370> says

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
their head so when someone says

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.290 
their head so when someone says
something<00:03:42.970> like<00:03:43.360> gee<00:03:44.260> you<00:03:44.560> look<00:03:44.590> great<00:03:45.300> it

cold<00:04:20.200> turkey<00:04:20.470> I've<00:04:21.720> always<00:04:22.720> felt<00:04:23.169> like<00:04:23.350> with

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
cold turkey I've always felt like with

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.250 
cold turkey I've always felt like with
eating<00:04:23.950> disorders<00:04:23.979> or<00:04:24.729> sex<00:04:25.240> addiction<00:04:25.780> that

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
eating disorders or sex addiction that

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.020 
eating disorders or sex addiction that
has<00:04:26.560> to<00:04:26.590> be<00:04:26.800> so<00:04:27.190> difficult

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
has to be so difficult

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.540 
has to be so difficult
because<00:04:28.570> they<00:04:29.110> can't<00:04:29.410> tell<00:04:29.650> somebody<00:04:30.070> not<00:04:30.370> to

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
because they can't tell somebody not to

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.270 
because they can't tell somebody not to
have<00:04:30.700> sex<00:04:31.060> and<00:04:31.389> it's<00:04:32.260> impossible<00:04:33.180> not<00:04:34.180> to<00:04:34.450> eat

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
have sex and it's impossible not to eat

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.110 
have sex and it's impossible not to eat
so<00:04:36.280> how<00:04:36.700> has<00:04:37.060> that<00:04:37.330> been<00:04:37.620> trying<00:04:38.620> to<00:04:39.250> reach

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
so how has that been trying to reach

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.430 
so how has that been trying to reach
that<00:04:41.370> balance<00:04:42.540> well<00:04:43.540> it's<00:04:43.900> been<00:04:44.200> difficult

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
that balance well it's been difficult

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.190 
that balance well it's been difficult
but<00:04:45.220> that's<00:04:45.820> why<00:04:46.150> the<00:04:46.210> hearth<00:04:46.570> has<00:04:46.840> different

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
but that's why the hearth has different

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.129 
but that's why the hearth has different
levels<00:04:47.290> of<00:04:47.650> programs<00:04:48.190> and<00:04:48.580> I<00:04:49.510> was<00:04:49.750> putting<00:04:50.050> in

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
levels of programs and I was putting in

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:52.560 
levels of programs and I was putting in
partial<00:04:50.500> hospitalization<00:04:51.120> which<00:04:52.120> is<00:04:52.330> where<00:04:52.540> I

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
partial hospitalization which is where I

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.750 
partial hospitalization which is where I
would<00:04:52.810> go<00:04:52.840> for<00:04:52.930> 12<00:04:53.380> hours<00:04:53.530> a<00:04:53.740> day<00:04:53.919> from<00:04:54.550> eight

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:54.760 
would go for 12 hours a day from eight

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.730 
would go for 12 hours a day from eight
a.m.<00:04:55.000> to<00:04:55.030> eight<00:04:55.300> pm<00:04:55.690> and<00:04:55.930> they<00:04:56.290> would<00:04:56.440> monitor

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
a.m. to eight pm and they would monitor

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:59.670 
a.m. to eight pm and they would monitor
all<00:04:57.070> of<00:04:57.430> my<00:04:57.610> meals<00:04:57.850> and<00:04:58.240> when<00:04:58.960> you<00:04:59.080> don't<00:04:59.350> eat

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
all of my meals and when you don't eat

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.210 
all of my meals and when you don't eat
you<00:05:00.100> get<00:05:00.310> a<00:05:00.520> boost<00:05:00.850> and<00:05:01.320> it's<00:05:02.320> an<00:05:02.740> enhancement

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
you get a boost and it's an enhancement

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.330 
you get a boost and it's an enhancement
with<00:05:03.790> a<00:05:03.820> lot<00:05:04.060> of<00:05:04.150> calories<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:05.340> basically

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.340 
with a lot of calories and basically

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.640 
with a lot of calories and basically
when<00:05:06.580> I<00:05:06.610> first<00:05:06.880> went<00:05:07.090> there<00:05:07.210> I<00:05:07.660> refused<00:05:08.350> to<00:05:08.410> eat

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
when I first went there I refused to eat

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.700 
when I first went there I refused to eat
so<00:05:09.010> I<00:05:09.040> would<00:05:09.310> always<00:05:09.430> get<00:05:09.669> a<00:05:09.730> boost<00:05:10.140> but<00:05:11.140> then<00:05:11.380> I

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
so I would always get a boost but then I

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.970 
so I would always get a boost but then I
realized<00:05:12.400> that<00:05:12.790> I<00:05:13.330> needed<00:05:13.480> to<00:05:13.900> eat<00:05:14.290> in<00:05:14.560> order

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
realized that I needed to eat in order

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.030 
realized that I needed to eat in order
to<00:05:15.250> get<00:05:15.370> better<00:05:15.580> and<00:05:15.970> part<00:05:16.960> of<00:05:16.990> the<00:05:17.080> reason<00:05:17.110> was

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
to get better and part of the reason was

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.960 
to get better and part of the reason was
to<00:05:18.610> help<00:05:19.419> myself<00:05:19.630> and<00:05:20.229> help<00:05:21.100> the<00:05:21.430> other<00:05:21.610> girls

to help myself and help the other girls
in<00:05:22.180> my<00:05:22.300> program<00:05:22.780> because<00:05:23.350> they<00:05:23.979> looked<00:05:24.250> up<00:05:24.430> to
