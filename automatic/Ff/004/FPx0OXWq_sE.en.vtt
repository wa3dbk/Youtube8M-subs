00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
quite opaque on two coats it did build

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.200 
quite opaque on two coats it did build
up<00:00:49.530> really<00:00:49.739> nicely<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.579> still<00:00:50.910> see

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
as it dried it kind of pulled away from

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.990 
as it dried it kind of pulled away from
the<00:00:57.930> edges<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.440> my<00:00:58.469> nail<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> bit<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.730> there<00:00:59.879> is

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
line but I have to look pretty hard to

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.590 
line but I have to look pretty hard to
see<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> beautiful<00:01:14.670> color<00:01:15.299> though

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
spring and simple this one covers pretty

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.580 
spring and simple this one covers pretty
well<00:01:37.970> on<00:01:38.179> the<00:01:38.299> first<00:01:38.479> coat<00:01:38.780> it<00:01:39.020> is<00:01:39.200> going<00:01:39.500> to

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
well on the first coat it is going to

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:40.899 
well on the first coat it is going to
need<00:01:39.770> to<00:01:39.799> because<00:01:40.280> I<00:01:40.310> can<00:01:40.460> see<00:01:40.640> through<00:01:40.880> it

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
need to because I can see through it

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.149 
need to because I can see through it
just<00:01:41.149> a<00:01:41.240> little<00:01:41.270> bit<00:01:41.560> the<00:01:42.560> formula<00:01:42.829> is<00:01:43.009> a

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
just a little bit the formula is a

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.100 
just a little bit the formula is a
little<00:01:43.819> bit<00:01:44.000> thick<00:01:44.329> I<00:01:44.509> feel<00:01:44.659> like<00:01:44.780> it<00:01:44.869> wants<00:01:45.049> to

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
little bit thick I feel like it wants to

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:46.960 
little bit thick I feel like it wants to
run<00:01:45.409> just<00:01:45.590> a<00:01:45.740> tiny<00:01:45.950> bit<00:01:46.100> but<00:01:46.369> it's<00:01:46.490> still<00:01:46.700> easy

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
run just a tiny bit but it's still easy

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.359 
run just a tiny bit but it's still easy
