00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:03.889
 so now let's move from the mechanism 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.889
 gear shift 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.489
 with 

00:00:11.489 --> 00:00:13.459
 it means work bal 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:16.459
 Amur Copernicus about which go 

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:20.169
 such here 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:24.659
 so called 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.589
 gear shift 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:28.199
 then you have to tell me what they are doing. 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.029
 they are pretty here 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.269
 OK 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.920
 and the clearance here is good processing quality 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.320
 not bad you can say that here 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.950
 fought under conditional 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.820
 to work he year 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.350
 do 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.540
 started here wear 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.670
 skillfully shifting uneven 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.160
 showed up 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:50.490
 more precisely from this trick which includes 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.750
 also 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.190
 tenge then you dare search engines 4 transfer 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.010
 but authorized 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.330
 brought it to the side 

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:03.130
 specific that part of the arguability 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.770
 mean why I figured out why so 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.040
 happened 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.040
 gear shift lever 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.880
 installed in the gearbox with us like this 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:14.760
 here 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.120
 with offset 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:17.640
 regarding russia 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.710
 it's worth saying 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.110
 there is a bearing in it 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.180
 such 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.290
 and assumed from now on he presses 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.730
 Sagaisk corpus is clearly installed 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:27.760
 so here 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.600
 started by the lever itself 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.510
 offset that is but it is so arranged that 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.360
 its center of gravity is shifted 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.190
 plus attached to it still 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.360
 shifting gears also adds weight and 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.000
 the lever is somewhat shifted 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.020
 always sideways in this direction 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.079
 so here is the central 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.079
 position of such a position 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.620
 prohibition when the lever is shifted to the side 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.660
 we have influences on this June 6 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.040
 and also squeezes her 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.350
 so here 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.350
 it all looks like this 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 he comes to life in her side 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.420
 besides th court here in spite of 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.519
 center court like this 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:13.209
 squeezing due to its weight again 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.560
 squeezes and since this plug stands with us 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.509
 freedom saved us a goal 

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:20.329
 and she too wrung out in the side and 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.049
 accordingly from this year 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:23.569
 place but forks 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.839
 nudges harder 

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:28.459
 how it takes root on June 6th 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.869
 Tambov gear unpolished stupidly 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:32.919
 zugi go this fork nobody this present 

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:35.019
 wow how came out of buildings and toothy 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:35.749
 and there is 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.619
 onyschuka is made of rather severely 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:39.309
 metal from soft 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:41.469
 I even saw him bend 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:43.529
 even at 5 you might think 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.019
 Here are clear that doctors 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.199
 she naturally cuddles verses 

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:48.219
 wore out 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:50.799
 and so she wore out all clear plug 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:51.959
 change 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.560
 so what was the reason for such wear 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.429
 why did it happen 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:59.069
 I think that's why 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:00.829
 our bearing is 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:02.349
 Well, this one is spherical 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.089
 which is a novelty, he stalled two 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:06.869
 interrogated by rings 

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:09.479
 and boring steel wire 

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:11.879
 ring ring below the top 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:14.529
 what happened to me means this lever 

00:03:14.529 --> 00:03:16.319
 whether from vibration then nothing 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.749
 give out this here's the upper ring 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:20.699
 implicated in place put 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:24.049
 Here they say they will try back 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:25.540
 does not work 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.979
 general squeezed 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:30.019
 this ring is up this way as it were 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.049
 sir hearth failed failed its points 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.019
 the bearings in this bearings 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:36.769
 moved a little over 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:38.980
 but again because he was dangling tax 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.219
 if you remember, he would hang out and sit clearly behind 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.439
 account tension is not required 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:45.699
 that's why some fell out failed 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:47.109
 bearings down 

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:48.919
 but having moved down 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:51.779
 but naturally he firstly twisted 

00:03:51.779 --> 00:03:54.439
 a little bit more and pressed on the plug where 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.659
 then here at the point you can see the place 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:58.729
 even wear most thomas 

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:01.969
 these shiny spot 

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:04.819
 lever pressed the novelty plug from his 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:05.619
 such a straight position 

00:04:05.619 --> 00:04:07.349
 twisted 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:10.399
 and suspension man began actively before 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:12.099
 star asterisk 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:13.829
 that's what his rubbed 

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.019
 but now it needs to be replaced 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.120
 meanwhile, from the abortion ran a total of 20 moto 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.039
 o'clock 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:22.139
 here we can say that he is young 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:24.249
 it can even be seen shame gears they 

00:04:24.249 --> 00:04:26.889
 in some places not even completely recycled 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.889
 so that is clear 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:36.550
 gears 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.550
 gear boxes 

00:04:40.499 --> 00:04:41.849
 correspondent rubles 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:44.929
 fastened with us she suddenly do not fully end 

00:04:44.929 --> 00:04:47.369
 will be and pressed ships hull here they are 

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:49.259
 see attempts to Moscow for a ton of 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.270
 eat us just iota the rest only 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.069
 internal 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:53.779
 rubber between them 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:56.030
 yes and affairs should be vulcanized 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:58.120
 Ie many years adab region temperature 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.970
 cheese rubber so that it does not fall from 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.830
 by metal 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.919
 and at the same time acquired the greatest 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:04.719
 hardness and elasticity 

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:07.169
 now I can not understand whether this plant 

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.120
 rubber 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.860
 short week will 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.599
 Tory itself low quality rubber 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.460
 and in general comfort 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:17.360
 Turks refined salin blocks rubber video 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.130
 already started to creep away only 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:20.969
 rubber from chair to falls 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:22.430
 peels off 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.840
 here and even you can see the pieces disappear 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.509
 savin bok can be said to have come in 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:27.430
 worthlessness 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.529
 and if they don't come, they will come here 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:31.609
 but how will come accordingly then 

00:05:31.609 --> 00:05:33.169
 in the sense of the area relative to 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:34.580
 pieces to hang out 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.599
 go there your hands 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:40.050
 will start or score here for these items 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.470
 but everything is clear here the shelves for the replacement 

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:43.409
 have one year and pedestal
