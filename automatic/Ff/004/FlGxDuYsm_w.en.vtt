00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.900
 a beautiful spring morning in march 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.130
 after a five-day journey, the Dutch cargo ship Johanner reaches the 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.629
 Dillinger harbor 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:17.449
 on board bring a cylinder with a weight of 138 tons 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.439
 and no 148 tons heavy opponents bring those in the Friedrich Wilhelm 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.439
 Hut in Mühlheim an der Ruhr were poured 

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:31.019
 Both components are for mechanical processing by the diet 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.260
 Maschinenbau GmbH has been transported to the valley 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.770
 But to do so, the almost 300 tons of steel must first of all from the boss to two 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.350
 saturated depth NADA be implemented 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.900
 A 350 ton and 1 250 tonne mobile crane of stone crane works are in use 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.670
 the challenge for the drivers 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.670
 with it in the so-called tandem flight 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:59.150
 since these 2 percent 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.090
 Materials are so short that they are unlikely to be exactly the same 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.250
 keep tight 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.260
 because otherwise the ropes can jump winter break and then the driving driver 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.700
 also at a disadvantage 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.400
 and communicate with each other that is not jerky for the movement that is 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:14.940
 beautiful 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.010
 running in a river 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.799
 because just announce 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.799
 There are very different mistakes to avoid 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.640
 for example, the pan in the wrong direction or in that 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.680
 second know above for example about master getting in the way that is 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.460
 stop the problem of Bavaria 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.990
 Perfect interaction between the two crane drivers is one thing 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.750
 However, this is also a key factor in communication 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.240
 ground staff 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:47.509
 that gives both drivers the right commands at the right time 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.570
 not everyone can do it the way he wants or have to give the command and 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.620
 the other two 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.580
 Percent in Dusseldorf so we have a warm floor here and 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.740
 Groundwater near it gives us wings of otherness to pave it 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.860
 and there we have to be able to buy from the outside 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.100
 it works that way too 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.249
 Communication and coordination fit 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:12.930
 and so are in the steel colossus after two hours of use ready for 

00:02:12.929 --> 00:02:14.239
 Departure 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.419
 much to the pleasure of the client 

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:20.829
 that works very well so I thought it would take a bit longer 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:23.069
 but that's really good 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.170
 Maschinenbau GmbH decides in the production halls 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.270
 Both components are after the mechanical processing in a 13 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:35.390
 Meter-long about 700-ton beach press for a blood profile 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:36.999
 installed 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:39.999
 which will be exported to China in late summer 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:42.559
 the first step of this laugh 

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:45.509
 in the production process is mastered 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:49.240
 Thanks to a stalemate and smooth deployment is the expert 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:51.409
 work for special crane 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:55.450
 suitable for a beautiful spring messenger at the port of Büdingen
