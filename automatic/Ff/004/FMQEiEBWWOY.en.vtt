00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.770

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.309
 eternal receives passion showed by your 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:17.510
 thomas and jerry if I see those pots a 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.640
 you will be fatigued again 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.290
 I just received the questions from 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.360
 Admission to the contest we are 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.460
 scientists that I'm sure that 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.230
 you've all heard on the radio the 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.290
 next lessons will be based on the 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:33.710
 we ask scientists is for idiots 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.780
 it is for super idiots to remember that 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.850
 they are the three best students in the final 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.010
 of the district the winners of the year 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.180
 past they won a trip to egypt for 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.180
 study the city 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.360
 the three friends did everything 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.360
 they could to prepare for the prepa 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:16.820
 alright guys let's donate that trip yes 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.820
 starts 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.750
 high unfortunately 20 minutes in the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.689
 library were not enough to 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.880
 exceed four years which means that 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:39.210
 Annota and Marlon will be our 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.230
 representatives in the final 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.330
 and generates good 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:46.450
 of course I know in the eighth team 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.400
 in the reserve was better than nothing but the 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.110
 possibility that the whole class will 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.440
 it would make you sick at the same time 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.440
 very remote 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.280
 poor sea ​​I think it would be fine if 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.190
 we went to visit him I'm sure that 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.940
 it would be good for fine speech for 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.980
 nothing 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.630
 Marlon did not get well and the 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.860
 Professor's predictions were a 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.470
 complete disaster 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.030
 the only students who did not put on 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.920
 bad were the paintings that did not 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.820
 they wanted and lords praises to more

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.780

 I was already in Egypt but tomás adopted 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.630
 a slightly more realistic attitude not 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.630
 we will get 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.140

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.640
 jerry explained her plan to the three friends 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:02.450
 and his desolate faces soon become 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.220

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.860

 correct answer is in the Black Sea 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:56.560
