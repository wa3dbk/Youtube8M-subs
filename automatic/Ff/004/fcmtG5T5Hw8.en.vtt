00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.049
 now all welcome another video this 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.040
 time I'm reaffirming because the rap that 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.040
 He had recorded stay 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.910
 by the focus 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.170
 but if I come to tell you what I read in the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:21.580
 Month of May 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:26.890
 something else my dad stole my tripod 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:30.910
 the tripod is not mine but yes so the 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:33.700
 camera is about seven random books if 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.300
 is greater there are not as many books as I 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.149
 I liked it 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.719
 because I had partial exams of the 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.210
 faculty 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:44.600
 luckily the end of my exams 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.829
 coincided with the one zone oblivion that 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.320
 organized the big king but the 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.820
 projects once vctor favorites and 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.040
 leave your career under commissioner 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.590
 they know what was called set 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.610
 books 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.430
 and if it means tending to irrigate me too and 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.590
 good benitez and join your reason and 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.249
 I just left the name to gather the 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:14.650
 Monday grip 

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:17.410
 and I was a little disappointed the truth 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:22.450
 It was not what I expected, expected less 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:24.040
 action and more info wanted more information 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.800
 about this world because it's very 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.380
 interesting but good not 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.570
 It was not so much the little information that 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.090
 has this book is already I knew about the 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:37.370
 other books there are not many new things 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.830
 does not add much history 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:43.930
 characters were very interesting and I 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:46.720
 they liked a lot marketing are great 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.860
 I really like the story is 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.090
 interesting I really liked it but 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.670
 cut the action a little 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.429
 I liked really do not know but I need 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.590
 more info so trust that you're going to 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.890
 write this prequel between this book 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.520
 and others are worth 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.580
 why 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.950
 I need more information be free of 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.340
 13 5 stars because it is very entertaining 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.400
 but I do not like or love my 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:20.610
 as much as I expected but I did like it and 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.410
 it's a very good book to read has been 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.750
 a pass if they want to read something in a 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.760
 couple of days it seems to me is a book of 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.549
 action and super fast read the next 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.319
 book that I read as you know if they saw my 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:36.569
 interior of the month 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.569
 at the beginning of the month of may law 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.849
 I did it 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.900
 instantly what normo gob this book 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.420
 I had not for almost four months 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.849
 in an instant and I did not read it because 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.720
 because twitter thanks twitter me 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:58.310
 I study so many things in this book that I 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.640
 packing and did not feel like reading it 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:04.430
 because I was like go what happens 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.560
 I do not want to read it to speak spoke 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.860
 but good with the imminent departure of 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.480
 the city of a fire said ok enough 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.010
 Macarena can not deny the most 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.310
 you have to read 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.409
 I read class sites I liked this book not 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.540
 I loved him I gave him four stars from 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:24.450
 five I liked very much the same as 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.150
 solved all the little problem of courage 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:30.120
 link 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.310
 it was very interesting that end 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:35.510
 very good this new character that is 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.040
 integra sebastiÃ¡n that we can finish 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:41.310
 very interesting also its history 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.890
 although quite predictable I did not know and 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:46.520
 there was that kind and quite predictable 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.590
 the truth but good 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:51.710
 they are things that I like to be, I liked it 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.750
 ruined a book yes but it was 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.110
 interesting, you have not resolved 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.210
 soon the mess this clark and 6 because I 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:03.080
 do not bank me more sun and after reading 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:04.400
 class lane sites clockwork on joe the 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.890
 first book of the trilogy the infernal 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.560
 devices also at home a clear one because 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:12.380
 all of you recommended me to read 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.000
 the history interspersed and they the 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.700
 I thank you very much because after 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.910
 explained appears very on the flash site 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.609
 grabbed the flower inter because one reason 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.370
 two 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:26.530
 I wanted to read this book I was not surprised 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.230
 I did not like it as much as I expected 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.140
 like 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.750
 and I was thinking about singing and I did not love it 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.910
 as much as I think I like it 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.169
 I do not know if I explain 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:39.639
 the truth is that 

00:04:38.169 --> 00:04:41.710
 the story is interesting the 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.570
 I like characters 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.610
 the time they are located 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:50.110
 done with a little 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:52.300
 the Victorian era is super cute and blah 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.060
 bla bla everything you want but the 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.759
 fashions and customs to me this time I 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.919
 really hit the machismo about 

00:04:57.759 --> 00:05:03.759
 everything and you see a lot in this book I 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:07.379
 crashes a lot or that is to revoke the 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:07.379
 book crash a lot of style 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.069
 because I did not like the story is that of 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.870
 there's no truth I can connect with the 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:15.120
 characters as much as I would have liked 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.520
 for this Victorian era theme of 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.470
 it really hits me a lot or is the steam 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:22.169
 punk was quite interesting never 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:25.379
 I had read steampunk and it was very good to 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:28.259
 see all the bark but it was not something that 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:30.030
 I will really love with my soul from 4 to 5 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:32.759
 stars this book also just 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.490
 finish reading as by enzo obviously 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:37.020
 Jump to read sites young in house the 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.599
 fourth book in the saga of mortal 

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:42.990
 instruments and I know that this book is like 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.210
 the most hated in the whole saga and the 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:47.729
 I really do not understand why because I do not 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.970
 loved it and so much more than the other 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:54.270
 it was this great triumph is very very 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:57.509
 well I hooked completely to 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.039
 difference from the flash site that was like 

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.599
 good and where it is playing where 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.969
 be this part I did not know anything about 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:05.550
 this nothing what happened in this book I 

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:08.280
 I was not aware I go out for a couple 

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.810
 that is formed thanks twitter 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.660
 except for that couple that way in 

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:14.569
 this book was not aware of anything of 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:17.419
 this book and the truth is that 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:20.749
 super great I loved it I do not know why to 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.449
 nobody I like is full of simon what 

00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:25.900
 which 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:28.150
 this book is all simon and I thank 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:30.249
 that like in the deck I liked it very much 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:34.210
 Twirl taking history despite 

00:06:30.249 --> 00:06:37.539
 that has the art of flash site to 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:40.809
 Although valentine disappears caput 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:43.930
 a very good turn dies so estimated villain 

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:47.020
 that seems really good the truth that I 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.819
 it seemed super interesting is Simon in 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:50.110
 seriously plays such an important role in 

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:51.520
 this book and many beliefs 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:53.319
 really producing that you read first 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.960
 try cher because the references that 

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:58.180
 do this book of this book are 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.039
 many and I liked them a lot because the 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.689
 true that I like the authors do 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:03.219
 references from other books about everything 

00:07:01.689 --> 00:07:04.960
 they are goals for the pages of this book 

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:09.099
 I do not remember when I finish I think that 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.909
 half or two days this book 10 55 

00:07:09.099 --> 00:07:12.249
 stars 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:15.139
 obviously I just finished reading sites 

00:07:12.249 --> 00:07:19.400
 in shows 

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:24.009
 to the love of my life lie law for 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.009
 france the second book of the trilogy 

00:07:25.139 --> 00:07:30.810
 this book was fÃ­os to both ugly not 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:33.419
 you just have to be that these characters 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:35.129
 as it is very installed all this 

00:07:33.419 --> 00:07:36.440
 I liked the book much more than the 

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:38.480
 previous 

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:39.830
 I insist I was still a bit shocked 

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.750
 from the Victorian era but I'm 

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:44.060
 getting used to but I do like a lot 

00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:47.840
 I like how the 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:51.890
 characters in this book and yes very good 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:53.540
 I gave him four and a half five 

00:07:51.890 --> 00:07:56.480
 cord and before you finish the 

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:59.270
 arvidsson and battlements read a little bit of 

00:07:56.480 --> 00:08:02.420
 site to flash shows 

00:07:59.270 --> 00:08:05.569
 I think that and about 60 pages so neither 

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:07.369
 I count for the month of May because 

00:08:05.569 --> 00:08:09.110
 and all these were the books that I read 

00:08:07.369 --> 00:08:12.129
 in the month so the worst the next 

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:14.669
 video that I hope will be soon 

00:08:12.129 --> 00:08:14.669
 Bah
