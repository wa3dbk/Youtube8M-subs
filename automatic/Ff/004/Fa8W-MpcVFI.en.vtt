00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
can see I did the lunar lander glitch I

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:58.160 
can see I did the lunar lander glitch I
had<00:00:56.309> my<00:00:56.519> friend<00:00:56.760> call<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.000> back<00:00:57.179> jump<00:00:57.840> on<00:00:57.989> top

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
had my friend call it back jump on top

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.410 
had my friend call it back jump on top
of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.410> lunar<00:00:58.590> lander<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.670> jumped<00:01:00.120> off<00:01:00.210> at

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
of the lunar lander and I jumped off at

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.200 
of the lunar lander and I jumped off at
that<00:01:00.510> spot<00:01:00.989> right<00:01:01.019> there<00:01:01.199> and<00:01:01.559> then<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:03.059> use

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
that spot right there and then just use

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.029 
that spot right there and then just use
a<00:01:03.300> pack<00:01:03.480> punch<00:01:03.750> machine<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.320> there<00:01:04.800> you<00:01:04.920> go

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
a pack punch machine and there you go

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:06.560 
a pack punch machine and there you go
you<00:01:05.399> have<00:01:05.460> an<00:01:05.580> upgraded<00:01:05.880> weapon<00:01:06.210> before

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
you have an upgraded weapon before

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.169 
you have an upgraded weapon before
whatever<00:01:07.470> round<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.009> want<00:01:08.160> now<00:01:08.789> the<00:01:08.850> only

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:09.179 
whatever round you want now the only

00:01:09.179 --> 00:01:10.609 
whatever round you want now the only
downfall<00:01:09.360> of<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> can't<00:01:10.380> get<00:01:10.470> out

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
downfall of this is you can't get out

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.450 
downfall of this is you can't get out
here<00:01:10.860> until<00:01:10.950> they<00:01:11.250> rocket<00:01:12.240> launches<00:01:12.630> so<00:01:13.500> the

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
here until they rocket launches so the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.609 
here until they rocket launches so the
second<00:01:14.850> glitch<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.330> another<00:01:15.780> spot<00:01:16.110> where<00:01:16.440> you

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
second glitch is another spot where you

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.469 
second glitch is another spot where you
just<00:01:16.830> jump<00:01:17.070> on<00:01:17.190> top<00:01:17.399> of<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.640> lunar<00:01:17.880> lander<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
just jump on top of the lunar lander and

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.300 
just jump on top of the lunar lander and
you<00:01:19.020> have<00:01:19.170> your<00:01:19.320> friend<00:01:19.530> come<00:01:19.710> over<00:01:19.920> again<00:01:20.009> and

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
you have your friend come over again and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.729 
you have your friend come over again and
call<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.700> then<00:01:21.569> you're<00:01:21.959> just<00:01:22.080> gonna<00:01:22.289> stay<00:01:22.560> on

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:22.739 
call it then you're just gonna stay on

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:24.020 
call it then you're just gonna stay on
it<00:01:22.770> until<00:01:23.039> it<00:01:23.220> gets<00:01:23.310> back<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.849> mainframe

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
it until it gets back to the mainframe

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.760 
it until it gets back to the mainframe
and<00:01:24.500> then<00:01:25.500> jump<00:01:26.069> off<00:01:26.280> right<00:01:27.349> when<00:01:28.349> you<00:01:28.500> see

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
and then jump off right when you see

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.620 
and then jump off right when you see
that<00:01:28.950> little<00:01:29.520> box<00:01:29.759> you're<00:01:30.060> gonna<00:01:30.119> actually

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that little box you're gonna actually

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.320 
that little box you're gonna actually
have<00:01:30.899> the<00:01:31.020> Sprint<00:01:31.289> jump<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.709> one<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.330> there

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:33.330 
have the Sprint jump this one and there

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:35.540 
have the Sprint jump this one and there
you<00:01:33.450> are<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.440> can<00:01:34.649> turn<00:01:34.830> around<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.340> walk

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:35.550 
you are and you can turn around and walk

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.309 
you are and you can turn around and walk
out<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.910> go<00:01:36.060> under<00:01:36.330> the<00:01:36.360> map<00:01:36.569> if<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.750> want<00:01:37.020> but

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
out and go under the map if you want but

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:38.690 
out and go under the map if you want but
I<00:01:37.500> really<00:01:37.890> didn't<00:01:38.069> want<00:01:38.190> to<00:01:38.280> do<00:01:38.369> that

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
I really didn't want to do that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.969 
I really didn't want to do that
so<00:01:39.630> now<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:39.840> third<00:01:40.050> spot<00:01:40.410> is<00:01:40.560> kind<00:01:40.770> of<00:01:40.950> a

so now the third spot is kind of a

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.059 
so now the third spot is kind of a
little<00:01:41.880> behind<00:01:42.239> the<00:01:42.300> rocket<00:01:42.539> exploring<00:01:43.229> but<00:01:43.860> I

00:01:44.059 --> 00:01:44.069 
little behind the rocket exploring but I

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:46.969 
little behind the rocket exploring but I
wanted<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.459> talk<00:01:44.700> about<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:45.379> my<00:01:46.379> other<00:01:46.560> channel

and there are ads on the video so
actually<00:02:05.789> no<00:02:05.910> I<00:02:05.940> think<00:02:06.090> it's<00:02:06.360> still<00:02:06.509> pending

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
actually no I think it's still pending

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.320 
actually no I think it's still pending
as<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.709> now<00:02:07.860> I<00:02:08.099> think<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.489> takes<00:02:08.640> like<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> day<00:02:09.000> or

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
as of now I think it takes like a day or

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.259 
as of now I think it takes like a day or
two<00:02:09.509> for<00:02:09.539> them<00:02:09.959> to<00:02:10.140> approve<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.560> but<00:02:11.340> anyways

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
two for them to approve it but anyways

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.059 
two for them to approve it but anyways
if<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.750> upload<00:02:13.080> like<00:02:13.260> three<00:02:13.560> or<00:02:13.650> four<00:02:13.680> more

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
if I upload like three or four more

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.800 
if I upload like three or four more
computer<00:02:14.550> tutorials<00:02:14.819> on<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.269> account<00:02:15.599> and

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
computer tutorials on the account and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.930 
computer tutorials on the account and
they<00:02:15.930> all<00:02:16.050> get<00:02:16.230> revenue<00:02:16.620> sharing<00:02:16.890> then<00:02:17.730> I'm

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
they all get revenue sharing then I'm

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.369 
they all get revenue sharing then I'm
pretty<00:02:18.269> sure<00:02:18.569> I<00:02:18.599> might<00:02:18.900> be<00:02:19.019> able<00:02:19.110> to<00:02:19.260> get

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
pretty sure I might be able to get

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.670 
pretty sure I might be able to get
partner<00:02:19.680> on<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.920> without<00:02:20.160> any<00:02:20.550> hesitation<00:02:21.680> so

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
partner on it without any hesitation so

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.170 
partner on it without any hesitation so
then<00:02:22.980> I'll<00:02:23.069> be<00:02:23.190> able<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.430> link<00:02:23.610> it<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:23.760> my<00:02:23.849> main

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
then I'll be able to link it to my main

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.800 
then I'll be able to link it to my main
so<00:02:24.630> that's<00:02:24.990> always<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.320> plus

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
so that's always a plus

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.650 
so that's always a plus
and<00:02:26.930> third<00:02:27.590> glitch<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:28.420> actually<00:02:29.420> something

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
and third glitch is actually something

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.809 
and third glitch is actually something
useful<00:02:30.230> you<00:02:30.440> do<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:31.010> lunar<00:02:31.250> lander<00:02:31.610> glitch

00:02:31.809 --> 00:02:31.819 
useful you do the lunar lander glitch

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.030 
useful you do the lunar lander glitch
and<00:02:32.260> everyone<00:02:33.260> knows<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.650> truck<00:02:33.860> on<00:02:34.010> the

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
other side you just jump on that and

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.260 
other side you just jump on that and
then<00:02:36.319> they<00:02:36.800> spawn<00:02:37.130> in<00:02:37.250> front<00:02:37.459> of<00:02:37.520> you<00:02:37.610> well<00:02:38.150> if

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270

you<00:02:38.360> jump<00:02:38.630> on<00:02:38.750> this<00:02:38.989> truck<00:02:39.260> it<00:02:39.819> they<00:02:40.819> spawn<00:02:41.090> in

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
you jump on this truck it they spawn in

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.800 
you jump on this truck it they spawn in
front<00:02:41.390> of<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:41.540> also<00:02:41.660> now<00:02:42.620> as<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:44.120> can<00:02:44.209> see<00:02:44.269> it
