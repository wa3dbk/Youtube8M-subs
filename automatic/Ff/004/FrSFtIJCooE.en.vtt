00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.620
 Seattle is a city of about 600 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.780
 thousand inhabitants located on the coast 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.030
 Pacific northwest of the United States 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.490
 our economy is very diverse 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:27.440
 boeing for aviation and microsoft for 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:29.300
 software are the two pillars of 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:31.100
 our economy the sectors of the 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.300
 medicine and health represents a 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.070
 other important part 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.050
 there are also the technologies of 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:40.880
 information and many small 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.470
 companies in the 80's 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.660
 citizens have constituted the organization 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.130
 called sustainable seattle this 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.930
 organization worked with the 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.300
 policymakers and other local actors 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.310
 to introduce the idea of sustainability 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.880
 in the policies of the turn to the end 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.100
 Account 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.020
 in the mid- 90s the city has 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.530
 adopted a new green plan as well 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:02.030
 is it sustainable 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.710
 the main moral duty of our 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.729
 generation and worry about the 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.439
 climate change 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:08.719
 it's decisive for the future of our 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.399
 city in the year 2000 the 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.840
 municipality decided to put in 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.060
 practice the kyoto protocol 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.069
 we reduced our gas emissions to 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:22.219
 greenhouse effect by 8 % compared to 

00:01:16.069 --> 00:01:24.289
 1990 level seattle city ​​light 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.719
 electricity company that belongs to 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:30.020
 the city is committed to having a balance sheet 

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.249
 carbon no seattle saw a light a 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.920
 achieved this goal 

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:38.990
 since 2005 we think that 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.549
 solutions to climate change are 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.590
 also solutions to many others 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.749
 problems in the world like our 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.209
 dependence on foreign oil and the 

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:48.889
 need to create jobs these are from 

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:52.929
 great opportunities for 

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:55.310
 the environment the economy and employment 

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.979
 today there are more than 900 cities 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.959
 in the United States is over 80 million 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.689
 of people who act for a 

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:03.919
 reduced climate effects 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:05.929
 the mayor of seattle's action is very 

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:07.549
 significant and the remarkable 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:09.969
 that so many mayors have joined 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.969
 this initiative 

00:02:12.749 --> 00:02:16.719
 the message we tried to 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.069
 forward with the mayors was that 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:19.689
 the united states would participate in the effort 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.389
 global fight against gas effect 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:25.409
 of greenhouse warming and 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.409
 other effects on climate 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.040
 in the past the transport system 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.170
 in the united states was centered on 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.060
 the automobile so apple we have 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.459
 thought it was not really viable 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.590
 we wanted to combine two aspects 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.940
 make sure we can offer a 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.860
 urban transport system that 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.110
 works in the future is also 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.640
 to respect the environment 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.500
 it means having a plan in favor of 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.989
 bike to convince people to use 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:54.569
 their bike rather than their car is 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:56.459
 also pedestrian scheme that encourages 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.200
 people to walk for recreation or the 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.180
 work rather than taking their 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.680
 car 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.330
 incentives such as the area of 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.890
 free transport in the city center 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:06.420
 allow people to take 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.430
 public transport for free 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:12.510
 this is an easy way to get 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.160
 move without needing a car there 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.750
 there are probably three elements to 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.709
 take into account to transform from 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.860
 effective way 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.630
 a transportation system the first 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.819
 is to ensure coordination between 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.950
 the communes must indeed worked 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.360
 with a large number of partners for 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.819
 change the way people go 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.070
 move also extend the second takes 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.049
 in consideration of the costs we have 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.269
 recently created a car park tax 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.799
 private in the city it is used 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.900
 to pay for the infrastructure of 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:44.040
 transport and improvements and the 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.140
 last is to change the 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.760
 behaviors of people we residents 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.560
 are already very respectful of 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.000
 the environment they are cycling 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.799
 or by public transport 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.170
 so it's easy for us to say 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.310
 use public transport is 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.850
 useful for the city and for 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.850
 the environment 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.580
 at the national level the building 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.710
 represents about 50% of the 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.850
 energy consumption we have a 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:11.800
 new program to improve 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.700
 energy efficiency of buildings 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.830
 existing 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.260
 our goal is that efficiency 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:18.910
 energy increase of 20% 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.560
 we are also working on a better 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.739
 autonomy at the top of buildings in 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.739
 construction 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:30.820
 the new library is a building 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.920
 entirely in very economical glass 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.020
 energy of the dark devices 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.730
 incorporated into the green itself allow 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.800
 to improve the quality of the light 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:41.740
 the building is not totally 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.300
 air-conditioned and pulsed from the 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:48.340
 floor closer to users 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.290
 of building the program called density 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.730
 bonus gives the possibility to 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.710
 promoters to build buildings 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.990
 bigger in the heart of the city 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.930
 if he undertakes to build buildings 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.860
 certified sustainable in principle even though 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.210
 is bigger 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.880
 a high quality building 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:05.740
 provided to the society of 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:08.050
 benefits in terms of water saving and 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.430
 of energy and thanks to the contribution 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.290
 financial statement 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:13.290
 we are buying more social housing 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.090
 was built in 1942 remained 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.170
 low- rent housing up to 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.320
 only a few years 

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:27.900
 it then became a subdivision for 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.550
 mixed income 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.760
 we should have 1700 homes 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:34.690
 about 600 will be for households to 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:38.680
 low income 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.720
 from asia and africa this is a 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:43.620
 true social mix experience 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.620
 in the accommodation 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.680
 we replaced the constructions 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:52.360
 dilapidated used for 50 years to 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:55.770
 to house low-income people 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.770
 economical and sustainable homes 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.260
 the evacuation of rainwater is done 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.260
 in a natural way 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:06.190
 this new neighborhood built for 50 to 100 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:10.030
 years will require tip 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.320
 less electricity and water it presents 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.530
 many aspects 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.530
 ecological 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:22.180
 the new center of the neighborhood is a 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.500
 building of more than 6000 square meters 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:26.290
 it is covered with panels 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:30.340
 photovoltaic it is heated through 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:32.320
 geothermal energy because of its choices and 

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:34.810
 also used materials and 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.730
 economical lighting the project benefits 

00:06:34.810 --> 00:06:38.820
 of low building certification 

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.820
 consumption 

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:43.870
 there will be many ipoints children 

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.000
 we have about 1300 children 

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:47.680
 when we finish we have so 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.660
 planned a lot of playgrounds 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.860
 open spaces for exits and 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:53.350
 outdoor games 

00:06:50.860 --> 00:07:00.670
 furthermore it is a neighborhood that we can 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:07:02.170
 walk the om conference 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:04.540
 it is the world organization of 

00:07:02.170 --> 00:07:05.980
 trade really marked Seattle in this 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.070
 about sustainability 

00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.960
 on this occasion the whole world has worn 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:12.730
 his attention on our city for 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.770
 learn about sustainability 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.830
 while we ourselves are still learning 

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.000
 on this topic think globally and act 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:20.740
 at the local level 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.480
 this is the teaching we have 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.400
 from this conference and it's 

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.540
 also what everyone has learned during 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.540
 this meeting of the om knows 

00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:41.650
 he 

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:41.650
 all 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.030
 we 

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:45.030
 we 

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:55.870
 no 

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:05.720
 not
