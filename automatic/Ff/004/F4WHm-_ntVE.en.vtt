00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.800
With this amazing view

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.100
of the Cala'n Porter beach

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.100 position:88%
I say hello to you once again from the island of Menorca

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.200
I'm Jose Carrasco

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.800
and as always

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.900 position:66%
I bring you another investment opportunity

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.000
In this case

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.200
on this occasion

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.800
it is an apartment

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.200
with these fabulous views

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.100
as you can see

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.900
we are in a place

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
which is very exclusive

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.900
from here you can see

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.900 position:59%
there are very few people on the beach

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.400
there is a machine in the distance

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.900 position:88%
which is carrying out some maintenance work on the beach

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.500 position:84%
and who would not imagine we are making this recording

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.500 position:83%
as you can check out from here the place is fantastic

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:03.900 position:78%
we are surrounded by beautiful natural countryside

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.700 position:64%
and only a few metres away from the beach

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.900
and the access is very easy

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.900
by walking down a few steps

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
as you can see here

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.900
here you can see them

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.800
and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.800
this is the terrace where I am

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.700
a long terrace

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.700
and narrow

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.500
but with

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.800
sufficient space to have a table

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.700
and a few chairs

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.000
and as you can see

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.700
it is a place that is privileged

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.500
from which to enjoy

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.500
all of this spectacular scenery

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.700
that we are looking at

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.400 position:58%
Let's take a look inside the property

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.000
it has recently been reformed

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.600 position:72%
and the outside carpentry is of a high quality

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.600
double glazing and aluminium

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.800
these shutters are the new style

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.900
very light and very resistant

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.600
this is the inside

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.600
it is an apartment with one bedroom

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.100 position:72%
but the fact is that it is extremely appealing

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.000 position:59%
and well decorated and nicely finished

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.700 position:56%
the kitchen does not lack any detail

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.600 position:78%
from here when you are cooking you can see the sea

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.300
which is such a privilege

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.700
here we have

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.400 position:88%
well the little space there is has been used really well

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.800
here we have a sliding door

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.700 position:73%
which is the door to the bathroom with a shower

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.100 position:77%
and here also there is space for the washer/dryer

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.700
and the water heater

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:04.900
as you can see

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.100
it is very bright

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.800 position:63%
because there is a window to the outside

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.400 position:58%
as you can see there is more greenery

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:21.000 position:81%
in reality this property is built into the precipice

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.500
in this cliff

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.500
which overlooks the beach

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.000
you can see the various elements

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.600
have been very carefully chosen

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.400
here we have the shower

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.900
all I feel is spot on

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.500
there are many details of comfort

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.800
such as the towel radiator

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.600 position:66%
all is ready to be used for the first time

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.000 position:70%
here we have the sitting room and dining room

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.300 position:63%
with those views always at the forefront

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.900
fabulous views

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000
and this hallway

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.900
which leads to the front door

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.100 position:75%
later when I finish the filming from the outside

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:19.700
I will add a few fragments of video

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.700 position:89%
showing the wonderful charm of the access to the property

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.500
here as you can see

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.300 position:59%
there is a hallway a distribution area

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:33.300 position:59%
and here there is another sliding door

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.400
to make the best use of space

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.100 position:61%
and here is the entrance to the bedroom

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.400
very bright with its own window

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.800
and ...surprisingly

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.100
we have

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.200
this dressing room

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:58.300
wardrobe and dressing room

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:04.600 position:69%
which disappears thanks to this sliding door

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.100
which we can leave closed

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.100
and is hidden

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:12.400
and here we have all of this space

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.900
very useful

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.500
it is an apartment which is ideal

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.800
for a couple

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.300
or for someone single

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.000
who wants to enjoy Menorca

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.200 position:73%
I think you could even live here all year round

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.600
it is a wonderful location

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.700
it has lots of privacy

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.800
fantastic views

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.300
for this location it is a one-off

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.500 position:67%
the current regulations as most of you know

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.500 position:88%
would now not permit such a building so close to the sea

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.700 position:91%
and for this reason these types of property are now unique

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.200
and furthermore

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.500 position:75%
it is a property which we should consider as new

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.500
since all the installations

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.700
all of the floors

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:06.100
all the windows and shutters

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.900 position:81%
practically nothing remains of the original building

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.100
from this fabulous terrace

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.700 position:80%
I would mention that the design is very sympathetic

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.200
and typical of the Baleares

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.900
always painted in white

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.400
and above all

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.200
for these spectacular views

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:34.500 position:63%
this beautiful beach of soft, white sand

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:37.500
this fabulous bay

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.300
as you can see in this video

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.900
today is the 6th of April

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.400
and we have fantastic weather

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.300
and here you can see

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:55.200
the clearness of the sea

00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.000 position:61%
and with all this wonderful environment

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:04.300
of rocks and vegetation

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.700
which as you can confirm

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:15.500
this is a unique place

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.300
as always I am available

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.900

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.300

until the next video
