 we learned that this is the first restaurant in the world 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.340
 because we met the doctor 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:55.019

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.750

 only tasty and yet interesting 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.900
 looks like 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.900
 but 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.260
 pancakes 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:43.299
 I noticed on my own that you are not following 

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.010

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.159

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:02.189
 I like them and those who are on a diet I students 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.189
 where girls tiramisu are just space and 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.159
 gone day to build such a restaurant in 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:15.280
 Peter I came then when I myself 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:18.310
 I was on a diet for a year and I just know 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.099
 how hard it is for people to eat out 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.259
 this is really a big problem in 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:25.750
 Petersburg probably cafe or restaurant 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:27.220
 which a specializes in healthy 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:32.280
 nutrition but it's all really very 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:37.690
 tasteless and I had an idea by us and 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:40.030
 healthy kitchen actually make and 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.409
 so over a hundred thousand people 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.770
 Petersburg can now come in 

00:04:41.409 --> 00:04:48.030
