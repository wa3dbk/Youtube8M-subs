00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.350
 departure 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.520
 for a lot of freedom from Alex and Ratmansky that he told 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.890
 the story of the little Atlantic chiefs this legend who were not there and 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.590
 who want to make debts of the performance suits that was very strong 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.410
 and soon, costumes 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.760
 actually this edition 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.760
 she runs away very far it's all about drawing simply 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.010
 when I draw clothes that no matter what clothes I think 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.939
 always to the constraints 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.720
 movements 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.830
 the red decade I do not see where it comes from yesterday but in the dance is 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.480
 still many more constraints are the constraints of wearing the 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.990
 constraints of night sweating compared to tissue cleaning 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.160
 terrassa it's full of technical things 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.690
 e besides the couture workshops of the opera garnier mastered extremely 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.440
 well she's at the studio absolutely fantastic monetize a lot of 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.030
 the state is made of very very very good quality silk taffeta 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.330
 for all the flowers hours the same features of self feather for the costume 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.330
 tichy and pikine is an extremely strong case 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.479
 the tests and the costumes of the statistics of course it's 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.479
 hardly synthetic this investment the million center but 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.000
 it was not so constrained that it's a deficit by 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
 report to a finding not at all 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.789
 the important thing is really that he 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.449
 most france that the costume is the most beautiful possible that is the most 

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:15.099
 close to the models that I come from 

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.099
 realize them 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.079
 thank you all the possible trials if all the costumes of the animals of 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.289
 drummondville facets 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.289
 much more than two seconds of the buzzer 

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:27.089
 mons 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.340
 it's at this level of all the victims of this act as well as I 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:32.759
 did not know the work 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:36.509
 and without working very very interesting in talks about it because there is a 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:37.559
 way to be 

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:39.919
 I want to progress in his work which is no 

00:02:39.919 --> 00:02:44.919
 it's really a job fast enough a good design I do not often have the 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:49.079
 387 from moscow like christine because it is rather the torre to qualify 

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.679
 it's important to love% 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:55.039
 butcher flats show the models he understood very very very 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:57.029
 well 

00:02:57.029 --> 00:03:00.699
 dressed in a suit can propose to know among the very advanced 

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.889
 well
