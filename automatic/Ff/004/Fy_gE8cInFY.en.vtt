like a clown because you've got to be
confident<00:02:10.540> when<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:10.780> comes<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.080> lip<00:02:11.230> liner<00:02:11.640> so

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
confident when it comes to lip liner so

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:19.380 
confident when it comes to lip liner so
if<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.810> take<00:02:13.990> your<00:02:14.050> pencil<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:18.150> you<00:02:19.150> start

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
if you take your pencil and you start

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.080 
if you take your pencil and you start
off<00:02:19.660> in<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.990> middle<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:24.280> just<00:02:24.310> draw<00:02:24.640> a<00:02:24.670> thin

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
off in the middle and just draw a thin

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:31.259 
off in the middle and just draw a thin
line<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.570> the<00:02:25.660> outside<00:02:25.810> as<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.350> can<00:02:26.560> see<00:02:30.269> you

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
line on the outside as you can see you

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.180 
line on the outside as you can see you
should<00:02:31.450> always<00:02:31.720> go<00:02:32.080> on<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.320> outside<00:02:32.410> of<00:02:32.860> your

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
should always go on the outside of your

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.210 
should always go on the outside of your
lips<00:02:33.750> or<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:35.709> actual<00:02:36.010> line

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:40.220 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.980 

because<00:02:40.820> then<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.180> gives<00:02:41.450> the<00:02:41.600> impression

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
because then it gives the impression

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.290 
because then it gives the impression
that<00:02:42.410> your<00:02:42.740> lips<00:02:42.920> actually<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.610> lot<00:02:44.270> more

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
that your lips actually a lot more

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:50.170 
that your lips actually a lot more
plumper<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.890> again<00:02:49.130> if<00:02:49.280> you<00:02:49.370> take<00:02:49.580> it<00:02:49.760> from<00:02:49.790> the

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
plumper so again if you take it from the

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.000 
plumper so again if you take it from the
middle<00:02:50.320> all<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:51.500> way<00:02:51.620> out<00:02:53.110> downwards<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:54.320> the

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
middle all the way out downwards and the

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.900 
middle all the way out downwards and the
same<00:02:55.220> on<00:02:55.490> the<00:02:55.670> other<00:02:55.700> side<00:02:57.700> and<00:02:58.700> for<00:02:58.850> the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
same on the other side and for the

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:10.450 
same on the other side and for the
bottom<00:02:59.090> again<00:02:59.510> always<00:03:00.020> start<00:03:00.500> in<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.650> middle

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.610 

I<00:03:10.520> just<00:03:11.270> rub<00:03:11.480> across<00:03:11.600> the<00:03:11.960> end<00:03:12.080> just<00:03:12.290> to<00:03:12.350> get

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
I just rub across the end just to get

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:21.360 
I just rub across the end just to get
any<00:03:12.770> nubbly<00:03:13.160> bits<00:03:13.340> off<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.760> you<00:03:13.880> may<00:03:14.000> have

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.730 

see<00:03:22.370> that<00:03:22.550> no<00:03:22.700> believe<00:03:22.940> it<00:03:23.230> you<00:03:24.230> just<00:03:24.380> move<00:03:24.560> it

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:24.740 
see that no believe it you just move it

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.440 
see that no believe it you just move it
off<00:03:24.860> with<00:03:25.040> your<00:03:25.130> hand<00:03:25.280> so<00:03:25.820> there<00:03:25.970> we<00:03:26.120> have<00:03:26.270> the

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
off with your hand so there we have the

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.940 
off with your hand so there we have the
line<00:03:29.170> doesn't<00:03:30.170> have<00:03:30.290> to<00:03:30.380> be<00:03:30.500> perfectly

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
line doesn't have to be perfectly

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.170 
line doesn't have to be perfectly
straight<00:03:31.160> because<00:03:31.460> you<00:03:31.580> can<00:03:31.700> actually<00:03:31.850> blend

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 
straight because you can actually blend

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.220 
straight because you can actually blend
it<00:03:32.390> in<00:03:34.420> now<00:03:35.420> if<00:03:35.600> you<00:03:35.690> just<00:03:35.840> take<00:03:36.020> a<00:03:36.050> little

totally covered in glass and then if you

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:12.400 
totally covered in glass and then if you
start<00:04:02.390> at<00:04:03.080> the<00:04:03.230> bottom

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:18.759 

Wei<00:04:12.980> Qi<00:04:13.040> all<00:04:13.720> along<00:04:17.170> and<00:04:18.170> again<00:04:18.440> if<00:04:18.530> you<00:04:18.620> feel
