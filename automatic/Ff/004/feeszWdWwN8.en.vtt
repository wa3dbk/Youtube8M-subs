we<00:01:46.509> are<00:01:47.319> we<00:01:47.469> kind<00:01:47.679> of<00:01:47.709> help<00:01:48.429> and<00:01:48.610> we<00:01:48.700> saw<00:01:48.879> it

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
we are we kind of help and we saw it

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.749 
we are we kind of help and we saw it
like<00:01:49.209> Lydia<00:01:49.599> that<00:01:49.959> much<00:01:50.200> of<00:01:50.409> a<00:01:50.709> lighter<00:01:50.950> cord

results<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:56.649> is<00:01:56.770> more<00:01:56.950> than<00:01:56.979> enough<00:01:57.250> time<00:01:57.399> to

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
results this is more than enough time to

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.669 
results this is more than enough time to
gab<00:01:57.729> guard<00:01:58.390> away<00:01:58.659> and<00:01:58.869> step<00:01:59.110> back<00:01:59.289> at<00:01:59.530> least
