00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.930 

you<00:01:00.390> know<00:01:00.480> we<00:01:00.600> had<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.809> beakers<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.890> had<00:01:02.100> our

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.109 
on so it's more of a seating thing for
today<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.369> that's<00:01:08.520> what<00:01:08.670> we<00:01:08.729> were<00:01:08.820> going<00:01:09.000> for

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
today so that's what we were going for

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.719 
today so that's what we were going for
we<00:01:10.020> use<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> dry<00:01:10.439> ice<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:11.220> tailor<00:01:11.400> mixing

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
we use the dry ice for tailor mixing

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.789 
we use the dry ice for tailor mixing
some<00:01:11.880> chemical<00:01:12.329> so<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:13.049> always<00:01:13.200> fun<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.530> grow

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
some chemical so it's always fun to grow

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.010 
some chemical so it's always fun to grow
in<00:01:14.040> a<00:01:14.100> lot<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.250> elements<00:01:14.579> to<00:01:15.210> show<00:01:15.420> who<00:01:15.600> exactly

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
in a lot of elements to show who exactly

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.530 
in a lot of elements to show who exactly
the<00:01:16.110> person<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.770> we<00:01:17.400> have<00:01:17.490> black<00:01:17.759> today<00:01:18.210> or

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the person is we have black today or

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.969 
the person is we have black today or
some<00:01:18.720> little<00:01:18.960> bit<00:01:19.110> different<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:19.680> it's<00:01:19.829> good

some little bit different but it's good

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.499 
some little bit different but it's good
to<00:01:20.009> mix<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.399> up<00:01:20.490> with<00:01:20.729> people<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.060> you<00:01:21.210> book

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
to mix it up with people that you book

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.899 
to mix it up with people that you book
shop<00:01:22.079> before<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.829> each<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.640> different

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
shop before and each one is different

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
know I got the ankles a target area we

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.340 
know I got the ankles a target area we
got<00:01:32.310> names<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.969> my<00:01:33.479> programs<00:01:34.079> who<00:01:34.229> were

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
got names of my programs who were

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.929 
got names of my programs who were
dribbling<00:01:34.799> different<00:01:35.579> aspects<00:01:35.880> of

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
dribbling different aspects of

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.539 
dribbling different aspects of
basketball<00:01:36.329> passing<00:01:36.869> jump<00:01:37.259> shot<00:01:37.530> you<00:01:38.430> know

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
basketball passing jump shot you know

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.980 
basketball passing jump shot you know
certain<00:01:38.909> things<00:01:38.939> are<00:01:39.240> necessary<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.899> have

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
certain things are necessary to have

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.069 
certain things are necessary to have
ankle<00:01:40.320> breakers<00:01:40.740> and<00:01:41.009> speed<00:01:42.000> what<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.899> looks

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
ankle breakers and speed what it looks

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.630 
ankle breakers and speed what it looks
like<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.409> actually<00:01:43.560> break<00:01:43.890> somebody's<00:01:44.310> ankles

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
like to actually break somebody's ankles

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.550 
like to actually break somebody's ankles
then<00:01:45.060> these<00:01:45.270> equations<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.020> actually<00:01:46.380> like

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
then these equations that actually like

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.990 
then these equations that actually like
how<00:01:46.710> would<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.979> actually<00:01:47.159> do<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.640> well<00:01:47.820> you

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
how would you actually do that well you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.539 
how would you actually do that well you
would<00:01:48.119> look<00:01:48.240> back<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.840> got<00:01:49.079> the<00:01:49.229> a

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
would look back you know you got the a

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:53.830 
would look back you know you got the a
minus<00:01:50.549> 1<00:01:50.789> matrix<00:01:51.090> one<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.320> the<00:01:52.409> negative<00:01:52.560> P

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
minus 1 matrix one to the negative P

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.380 
minus 1 matrix one to the negative P
1275<00:01:54.840> 365<00:01:55.799> days<00:01:56.039> a<00:01:56.070> year<00:01:56.189> 12<00:01:56.670> months<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.360> year

1275 365 days a year 12 months a year
and<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.250> know<00:01:59.369> then<00:01:59.549> you'll<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.820> some

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
and then you know then you'll get some

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.889 
and then you know then you'll get some
orders<00:02:00.299> around<00:02:00.600> here

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
orders around here

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.440 
orders around here
but<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:02.039> asked<00:02:02.310> for<00:02:02.340> corn<00:02:02.670> photography<00:02:03.210> and<00:02:03.329> -

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
but you asked for corn photography and -

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.550 
but you asked for corn photography and -
productions<00:02:03.990> they'll<00:02:04.079> probably<00:02:04.229> give<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.500> a

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
productions they'll probably give you a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.800 
productions they'll probably give you a
valid<00:02:04.829> answer<00:02:05.070> -<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.969> appreciate<00:02:06.539> you<00:02:06.659> guys

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
valid answer - so appreciate you guys

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
like to capture him as spider-man also

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.380 
like to capture him as spider-man also
is<00:02:18.920> another<00:02:19.220> aspect<00:02:19.430> of<00:02:19.790> himself

so<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.689> inside<00:02:21.079> shoe<00:02:21.349> was<00:02:21.620> cool<00:02:21.890> because<00:02:22.220> we

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:22.579 
so the inside shoe was cool because we

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.339
