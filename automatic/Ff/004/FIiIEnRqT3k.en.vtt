00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.420
 live feeding is simpler than 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.370
 that one believes 

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.090
 that's good for me is that I eat a hare 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.280
 live for nothing 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.000
 just refers to those 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:25.020
 foods that have maximum vitality 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.170
 that is, they are alive and that therefore 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.760
 they are foods that will bring us 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.180
 a lot of energy will bring us 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.270
 Quality nutrients will provide us with 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.070
 enzymes vitamins 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.830
 all the nutrients that our body 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.400
 you need to function well and for good 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.400
 nourish 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.570
 here the other time when we chat 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.700
 we talk that the feeding 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.190
 It is usually very 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.020
 directed to supply nearly 100% 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.440
 cooked 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.140
 and obviously that brings its consequences 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.480
 and what we try to boost the 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:08.680
 people who have exclusively 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.680
 live feeding 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:14.960
 they mainly eat all raw 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.799
 alive would come to be as a synonym of 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.040
 raw live means that to give you 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.460
 a 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:26.130
 a very complex classification but they are 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.470
 all those things that offered by 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.190
 nature in the case of fruits 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.860
 of legume cereals 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.070
 of the sprouts and others that have not 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.979
 been exposed to a cooking process and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.840
 that the sun has been the only one that has 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.120
 cooked at a temperature that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.210
 generally does not exceed 45 degrees is 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.610
 say all those products that we 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:53.130
 they provide nature and that the sun has 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.010
 done its natural cooking is is a 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.110
 live product 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.240
 and that out there we use 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.520
 different techniques including 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.800
 dehydrated are live products 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.080
 as long as they have not passed the 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.060
 temperature that I mentioned to you that is the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.100
 that supports nature so that it does not 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.650
 damage the structure of the molecule is not 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.290
 true 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:18.640
 the maximum exponent of that of the 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:21.280
 alive vitalizing food are a 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.819
 process that nature uses with 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:27.250
 the seeds and with the kids like that with 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.830
 all the little seeds that is the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.330
 germination 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.820
 and that's a little bit what we're going to 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.320
 chat today gives to talk much more the 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.670
 live feeding obviously not that 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:41.070
 is limited to a duckling to buds 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.920
 sprouted but I could tell you one thing 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.260
 so that you have a clear picture 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.890
 yes if I wanted it 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.340
 if for example you harvest an apple 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.340
 From the tree 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.050
 this was forming part of the plant 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.360
 and at its right point of maturation you are 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.820
 ripping in with the very vital moment 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.370
 when you see it and let it support each 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:08.830
 the manzanita is going to spend a week 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.780
 spend 10-15 days 20 days and you will know 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.550
 that the cascarita will burn 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.620
 starts there starts a whole process of 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.200
 des vitalization until it ends 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.360
 rotting good when I was more alive 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.520
 when I was when you took it out of the 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.440
 plant that a month later the idea is 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.220
 eat all those products as close 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:29.620
 possible harvest harvest 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.240
 because it's when more energy has and 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.400
 we eat just to 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.340
 vitalize our body without subjecting it to 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.709
 no special cooking process 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.900
 that is the idea we are 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:45.079
 used to cooking everything 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.180
 the idea is that we start to incorporate 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.579
 abruptly because otherwise our 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.640
 organism can do what is called 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:55.129
 intense depurative processes and generate 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.739
 certain annoyances I for example always 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:04:00.109
 I advise to go little by little adding these 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.689
 live foods because they are the ones that 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:04.640
 they are really going to nourish your body and 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.560
 they will supply the enzymes and all the 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.900
 vitamins and minerals and everything 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.870
 other is to start incorporating your 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.159
 Feeding some sprouts that is 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.610
 what are they called bud in the 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:19.510
 supermarket and other outbreaks 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.100
 or raw salads as close as 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.540
 ideal I always say and this seems like a 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.670
 madness to help is that everyone can 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.680
 have a small garden in your house 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.900
 even you do not need there 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.040
 indoor horticulture is therefore 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.110
 You can have a little room inside the 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.430
 department on the balcony that is not 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.760
 you need to have one hectare to 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.370
 produce your own food now 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:42.970
 let's see even we go with juan that 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:45.280
 who accompanies us today also goes and we 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.100
 will teach juana how to make sprouts 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.800
 it is very easy we can do it at home 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:52.480
 germinated the same thing that sprout for those 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.880
 they are different stages but of the same 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.610
 germination process at the beginning and 

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.620
 then the young bud and then bud 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:01.900
 adult nest the plants have different 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.640
 properties an outbreak of a germinated is 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.040
 only one instance a process 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.450
 they have different because they have 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.790
 different properties in the sense of 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:13.270
 that the little seed when it is asleep 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:15.720
 has all the proteins and all the 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.850
 complex sugars all like 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.770
 stacked up being the reserve so that 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:22.480
 once the germ that is in its 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:28.090
 interior that life 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:31.650
 mijita once life explodes all 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:36.160
 the nutrients multiply then 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.080
 there is the moment of greatest vitality and 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.650
 of higher concentration of nutrients 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:44.650
 that is that and incorporate sprouts 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:47.020
 germinated in the initial stages to your 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.540
 Food is going to bring you a lot of life 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.660
 much vitality a lot of energy inclusive 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.100
 is going to help repair the body is going 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.750
 to give the possibility of recovering from 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.550
 diseases because so many of the 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.650
 diseases have to do with a 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:01.570
 body that has gone intoxicating that no 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.580
 has vitamins reserves that we 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:06.430
 we have spent all the enzymes that 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.620
 we had reservations then these 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.500
 nutrients to be of high quality 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:13.360
 we are going to return those those nutrients 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:16.420
 so that our body can make it 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.160
 in front of all those diseases and all 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.200
 those those things that have not happened 

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.390
 in the body because the same gone as 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.740
 who says fusing this and this has 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:25.430
 something to do with what are the techniques 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.280
 depuratives 

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:32.090
 lasting is not a depurative technique in 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.010
 if the consumption of sprouts and sprouts 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:36.760
 young people are not productive techniques 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.710
 if they favor debugging because 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:42.410
 they need very little digestive work what 

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:45.770
 can eat at any age is easy 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:48.620
 to make is cheap they can eat it from 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.380
 the babies up to those who are 90 years old is 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.750
 very easy to digest for the process 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.270
 digestive requires almost no work 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:58.840
 so your energy is not distracted 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.790
 all the time went into digestion 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:03.040
 so 

00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.810
 uses that energy to get the 

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.200
 crap that has been leaving us all 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:10.870
 canned processed food 

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.810
 cooked 100% all the time you understand 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:16.210
 all that helps favors for a matter 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:17.770
 that does not allow us to do the 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.300
 cleaning of our body is as if 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:20.590
 I'm going to say I do not have time to clean 

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:23.530
 for already working whether you are 

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:25.660
 working and rested a bit and said 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.450
 well I have time to prepare for 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:31.180
 cleanse the body cleansing that is is 

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:33.250
 the cleanliness that your own organism 

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.690
 of all the garbage that has gone 

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.690
 accumulating in your body
