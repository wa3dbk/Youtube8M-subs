but<00:00:24.590> that's<00:00:25.590> not<00:00:25.859> going<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.189> happen

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.430 

temperatures<00:00:38.790> are<00:00:39.149> down<00:00:39.480> in<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> teens<00:00:39.809> today

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440

temperatures are down in the teens today
and<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> windchill<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.850> even<00:00:42.239> colder<00:00:42.809> so<00:00:43.620> I

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
and the windchill is even colder so I

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.959 
and the windchill is even colder so I
don't<00:00:43.860> think<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.129> bikes<00:00:44.370> coming<00:00:44.640> out<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.910> the

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
don't think the bikes coming out of the

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:45.260 
don't think the bikes coming out of the
garage

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
garage

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.819 
garage
in<00:00:45.739> fact<00:00:46.739> like<00:00:47.190> been<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.760> garage<00:00:47.879> for

there follow the instructions let the
engine<00:01:37.320> run<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.799> little<00:01:38.009> while<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.720> get

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
engine run for a little while and get

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.510 
engine run for a little while and get
that<00:01:39.869> fuel<00:01:40.200> stabilizer<00:01:40.860> all<00:01:41.159> through<00:01:41.400> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
that fuel stabilizer all through the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.490 
that fuel stabilizer all through the
carburetor<00:01:41.909> through<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:42.479> system<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.380> will

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
carburetor through the system that will

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.499 
carburetor through the system that will
keep<00:01:43.649> your<00:01:43.860> car<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.490> your<00:01:44.610> fuel<00:01:44.850> system<00:01:45.119> from

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
keep your car and your fuel system from

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.219 
keep your car and your fuel system from
gumming<00:01:45.869> up<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:47.329> you<00:01:48.329> won't<00:01:48.509> have<00:01:48.720> those<00:01:48.899> kind

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
gumming up and you won't have those kind

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.200 
gumming up and you won't have those kind
of<00:01:49.320> corporation<00:01:50.009> fuel<00:01:50.340> problems<00:01:50.939> in<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
of corporation fuel problems in the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.260 
of corporation fuel problems in the
spring<00:01:51.509> when<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.780> go<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> fire<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.500> up

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
spring when you go to fire it up

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.830 
spring when you go to fire it up
probably<00:01:54.270> another<00:01:54.479> wise<00:01:54.750> thing<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.200> do<00:01:55.619> is

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
probably another wise thing to do is

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.350 
probably another wise thing to do is
change<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.140> oil<00:01:58.200> in<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> oil<00:01:58.950> filter<00:01:59.549> now

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
change the oil in the oil filter now

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.870 
change the oil in the oil filter now
your<00:02:00.600> oil<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.290> your<00:02:01.680> filter<00:02:01.979> gets<00:02:02.399> full<00:02:02.670> of

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
your oil and your filter gets full of

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.130 
your oil and your filter gets full of
chemical<00:02:03.840> particles<00:02:05.210> just<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.360> mod<00:02:06.540> ball<00:02:06.810> stuff

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
chemical particles just a mod ball stuff

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.300 
chemical particles just a mod ball stuff
maybe<00:02:07.380> even<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.710> little<00:02:07.799> bit

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
maybe even a little bit

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.919 
maybe even a little bit
so<00:02:08.729> it's<00:02:08.849> good<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.030> drain<00:02:09.360> that<00:02:09.479> out<00:02:09.660> put<00:02:09.869> some

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
so it's good to drain that out put some

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.339 
so it's good to drain that out put some
fresh<00:02:10.380> stuff<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.730> will<00:02:11.880> keep<00:02:12.090> your

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
fresh stuff in and that will keep your

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:15.080 
fresh stuff in and that will keep your
your<00:02:13.349> whole<00:02:13.560> engine<00:02:14.010> from<00:02:14.220> having<00:02:14.550> any<00:02:14.730> little

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
your whole engine from having any little

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.000 
your whole engine from having any little
my<00:02:15.239> new<00:02:15.420> corrosives<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.380> there<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.830> might

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
my new corrosives in there that might

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.860 
my new corrosives in there that might
damage<00:02:17.280> the<00:02:17.640> engine<00:02:18.000> when<00:02:18.150> it<00:02:18.239> sits<00:02:18.569> for<00:02:18.840> a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
damage the engine when it sits for a

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.170 
damage the engine when it sits for a
long<00:02:19.110> time<00:02:19.410> one<00:02:20.370> of<00:02:20.400> the<00:02:20.550> more<00:02:20.700> important

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
long time one of the more important

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.880 
long time one of the more important
things<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.540> do<00:02:21.720> also<00:02:21.930> is<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.500> check<00:02:22.739> the

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
things to do also is to check the

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.309 
things to do also is to check the
battery

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
battery
