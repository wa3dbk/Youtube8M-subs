00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.649 
pretty heavily let me know what
sensitivity<00:01:53.619> you<00:01:53.710> guys<00:01:53.829> are<00:01:53.950> using<00:01:54.659> obviously

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
sensitivity you guys are using obviously

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.669 
sensitivity you guys are using obviously
it's<00:01:55.840> different<00:01:56.259> from<00:01:56.320> pc<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.039> console<00:01:57.549> but

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
it's different from pc and console but

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:02.279 
it's different from pc and console but
MPC<00:01:59.679> i'm<00:01:59.860> personally<00:02:00.520> using<00:02:00.759> not<00:02:01.659> for<00:02:01.840> console

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
MPC i'm personally using not for console

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.219 
MPC i'm personally using not for console
impersonally<00:02:02.799> using<00:02:03.750> sensitivity<00:02:04.750> three

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
impersonally using sensitivity three

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.959 
impersonally using sensitivity three
right<00:02:05.439> now<00:02:05.619> i<00:02:05.890> just<00:02:05.950> change<00:02:06.429> it<00:02:06.640> but<00:02:06.759> i<00:02:06.819> did

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
right now i just change it but i did

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.180 
right now i just change it but i did
really<00:02:07.149> well<00:02:07.270> too<00:02:07.719> and<00:02:08.049> i<00:02:08.110> really<00:02:08.979> think<00:02:09.069> it

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
really well too and i really think it

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.589 
really well too and i really think it
just<00:02:09.250> depends<00:02:09.519> on<00:02:09.610> map<00:02:09.849> if<00:02:10.030> it's<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.209> very<00:02:10.360> close

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
just depends on map if it's a very close

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.420 
just depends on map if it's a very close
range<00:02:10.810> map<00:02:11.500> should<00:02:12.010> use<00:02:12.129> a<00:02:12.160> higher

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
range map should use a higher

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.479 
range map should use a higher
sensitivity<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.299> if<00:02:13.750> you're<00:02:13.920> bigger<00:02:14.920> longer

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
sensitivity and if you're bigger longer

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.369 
sensitivity and if you're bigger longer
range<00:02:15.700> shots<00:02:16.030> use<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.390> lower<00:02:16.629> sensitivity<00:02:16.870> this

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:17.379 
range shots use a lower sensitivity this

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:20.150 
range shots use a lower sensitivity this
is<00:02:17.530> all<00:02:17.680> common<00:02:18.069> sense<00:02:18.450> in<00:02:19.450> gaming<00:02:19.840> so

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
is all common sense in gaming so

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.869 
is all common sense in gaming so
hopefully<00:02:21.160> guys<00:02:21.280> having<00:02:21.489> the<00:02:21.549> time<00:02:21.730> and

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
hopefully guys having the time and

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.910 
hopefully guys having the time and
playing<00:02:22.060> backup<00:02:22.450> I'm<00:02:23.049> gonna<00:02:23.170> start<00:02:23.410> playing<00:02:23.739> a

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
playing backup I'm gonna start playing a

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.050 
playing backup I'm gonna start playing a
lot<00:02:24.430> though<00:02:24.880> i'm<00:02:25.540> in<00:02:25.750> DC<00:02:25.840> has<00:02:26.140> a<00:02:26.170> lunch

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060
