00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.219
 guys talking here Patriotic dog all here 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.950
 to tell you 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.430
 a cool legal tip difference between 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.300
 bryophytes pteridophyta angels leg and 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.970
 gymnosperms or the vegetables galley 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.490
 many people have doubts then they follow a 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.260
 evolutionary order bryophytes 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.870
 pteridophytes gymnosperms and angiosperms 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.290
 come on bryophytes epithelium pity tape are 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:41.059
 cryptograms plants, ie plants that 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.030
 have hidden reproductive organs 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:48.960
 gymnosperms and angiosperms are plants 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.710
 phanerogams that is has re organs 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.280
 apparent bryophytes producers staff 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.210
 the mosses are very simple plants as well 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.660
 calm plants that are vascular 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.049
 exactly does not have vaz counted on 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.770
 the pteridophytes that are 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.220
 encrypted are personal plans 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.280
 vascular 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.600
 a classic example of pteridophytes 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.330
 ferns or larger plants 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.590
 hospitals of the condition of larger plants 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.500
 that the worst notes 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.450
 the evidence is the low they are plants 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.810
 besides being encrypted 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.670
 are basculus plants have several 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.180
 conductors a very important thing 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.369
 between off pteridophytes is that they have a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.520
 personal life cycle as well as 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.100
 the ones we have in angiosperms they 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.740
 have a lifecycle that will not walk their 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.500
 that is, the plant is in a 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.649
 range and top state and then can itu 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.710
 be sitting off to expose the 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.180
 I enjoyed a lot with par 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:57.869
 bryophytes then epithelium software is 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.210
 The tape opens the cycle in which the 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.590
 you bet a large part of your 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:07.799
 The longest lasting circle is the 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:09.989
 and the less durable cycle 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:13.200
 where the plant passes faster is the 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:13.710
 cycle expose the phyto then bryophytes one 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.800
 cycle 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.710
 but enduring is the gametophyte phase and 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.020
 seconds is the exploited phase 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.200
 tape that does not happen with the 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:27.930
 pteridophytes to pteridophytes to plant 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.630
 passes much of the life in the exposed phase 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.100
 or tape and quickly passes through a phase 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.710
 top range tam 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.510
 So it was really worth you, will you? 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.840
 see this information okay 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.290
 and about gymnosperms yanjiao the legs 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:47.340
 let's go gymnosperms the attention was 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:50.180
 first plant to appear and mind or 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.070
 It's time for legal information to 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.950
 gymnosperms was the first plant 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.490
 to appear mindless are plants 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.920
 vascular phanerogams that have 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:05.100
 seed is a plant that passes its 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:09.360
 I almost lost my life in the ready phase 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:11.970
 the angiosperms that are the most 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.270
 evolved plants are the person's option 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.970
 make some vascular can in 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:23.310
 flower seeds and now has a large 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:26.580
 novelty the presence of fruit or fruit 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:29.670
 personal fruit does not exist or remember 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.940
 office or pedophile or even in the legs 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:36.080
 the fruit is a structure that protects the 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:40.350
 the fruit and comes precisely from the 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:43.650
 ovary of the plant or the personal fruit 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:46.680
 came from the ovary and the seed comes from the ovule 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.510
 and this structure which is the fruit 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.380
 it will only exist in plants 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:55.530
 angiosperms, why does the 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.210
 gymnosperms has no fruit because the 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.990
 people do not wait is not yet a plant 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:03.930
 as superior as the angel then 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:07.050
 gymnospermas personal it has no fruit is 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:10.110
 the only one to have seeds bare seeds 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.960
 naked because there is no protecting fruit 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:17.270
 the seed that does not happen with the two 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:18.480
 legs that have a fruit and protect the 

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:21.150
 seed 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.690
 now watch out you've seen a lot 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.000
 an anj the plant that has fruit that 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.300
 You call it fruit that actually 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.580
 the pseudo-fruit is good then you later 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.800
 see this matter of opinion of your 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:37.350
 fruit and what it is a fruit but I will give 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:41.040
 you a very important tip when 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:44.280
 fruit inside it has seed always goes 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:46.890
 there is seed inside the fruit 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.050
 It's good, so the option is nice 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.510
 over off the pteridophytes of our 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.130
 lands and angiosperms hope to have helped 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.610
 stay with god 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.610
 thank you guys
