00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.830 
I might note there their boots don't
have<00:01:52.439> these<00:01:52.590> really<00:01:52.770> big<00:01:53.130> heels<00:01:53.460> on<00:01:53.759> them<00:01:53.909> it's

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
have these really big heels on them it's

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.500 
have these really big heels on them it's
just<00:01:55.049> an<00:01:55.170> average<00:01:55.530> size<00:01:55.829> boot

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:57.510 
just an average size boot

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.660 
just an average size boot
sort<00:01:58.230> of<00:01:58.320> normal<00:01:58.590> but<00:01:58.680> very<00:01:59.010> very<00:01:59.370> very

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
sort of normal but very very very

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.190 
sort of normal but very very very
accurate<00:02:00.120> in<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.300> respect<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:03.750> at<00:02:04.080> least

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
accurate in that respect so at least

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.140 
accurate in that respect so at least
they<00:02:04.410> don't<00:02:04.530> boost<00:02:04.830> him<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.160> with<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.370> heel<00:02:05.670> it's

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:06.150 
they don't boost him up with a heel it's

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.000 
they don't boost him up with a heel it's
just<00:02:06.330> he's<00:02:06.480> a<00:02:06.510> big<00:02:06.810> figure<00:02:07.170> he's<00:02:07.500> just<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.740> new

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.010 
just he's a big figure he's just a new

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.950 
just he's a big figure he's just a new
tall<00:02:08.369> body<00:02:08.640> that<00:02:08.940> I<00:02:08.970> think<00:02:09.270> is<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> little<00:02:09.510> too

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
tall body that I think is a little too

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.660 
tall body that I think is a little too
tall<00:02:10.910> in<00:02:11.910> fact<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.260> might<00:02:13.920> even<00:02:13.980> notice<00:02:14.340> notice

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
tall in fact I might even notice notice

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.970 
tall in fact I might even notice notice
the<00:02:14.820> gap<00:02:15.090> between<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.840> inner<00:02:16.200> cloak<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.800> the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
the gap between the inner cloak and the

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.490 
the gap between the inner cloak and the
ground<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:17.940> definitely<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.260> niche

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
ground it's definitely it's a niche

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.620 
ground it's definitely it's a niche
there<00:02:19.890> well<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.820> should<00:02:21.060> drag<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.300> ground

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
there well this should drag the ground

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:24.560 
there well this should drag the ground
later<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.620> know<00:02:22.740> this<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.240> it<00:02:24.240> was<00:02:24.360> right<00:02:24.540> on

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
later you know this is it was right on

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.240 
later you know this is it was right on
the<00:02:24.810> ground<00:02:24.990> level<00:02:25.260> or<00:02:25.500> it<00:02:25.560> covered<00:02:25.890> his<00:02:26.010> boots

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
the ground level or it covered his boots

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.000 
the ground level or it covered his boots
if<00:02:26.490> anything<00:02:26.910> seemed<00:02:27.240> more<00:02:27.660> like<00:02:27.810> that<00:02:28.110> this

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
if anything seemed more like that this

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.370 
if anything seemed more like that this
one<00:02:29.220> you<00:02:29.490> can't<00:02:29.760> even<00:02:29.850> get<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.210> down<00:02:30.420> to<00:02:30.870> touch

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
one you can't even get it down to touch

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.310 
one you can't even get it down to touch
his<00:02:31.560> boots<00:02:32.360> so<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.540> should<00:02:33.750> be<00:02:33.780> an<00:02:33.930> indicator

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
his boots so that should be an indicator

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.080 
his boots so that should be an indicator
of<00:02:34.440> why<00:02:34.650> he's<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.800> little<00:02:35.070> tall<00:02:35.310> they<00:02:35.610> added<00:02:35.940> too

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
of why he's a little tall they added too

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.570 
of why he's a little tall they added too
much<00:02:36.120> height<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.750> him<00:02:36.870> I<00:02:37.050> may<00:02:37.680> just<00:02:37.980> get<00:02:38.430> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
much height to him I may just get the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.580 
much height to him I may just get the
figure<00:02:38.880> body<00:02:39.090> cut<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.630> legs<00:02:39.840> down<00:02:40.110> some

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
figure body cut the legs down some

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.400 
figure body cut the legs down some
shortening<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.250> he'll<00:02:41.520> look<00:02:41.760> a<00:02:41.910> lot<00:02:42.060> better

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
shortening and he'll look a lot better

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.990 
shortening and he'll look a lot better
when<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.590> head<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:44.070> height<00:02:44.310> ratio<00:02:44.340> is

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
when that head to height ratio is

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.150 
when that head to height ratio is
reduced<00:02:45.360> he'll<00:02:45.870> look<00:02:46.050> better<00:02:46.110> now<00:02:46.860> while<00:02:47.070> I

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
reduced he'll look better now while I

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.680 
reduced he'll look better now while I
reducing<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.850> height<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.060> my<00:02:48.270> custom

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
reducing to the height of my custom

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.900 
reducing to the height of my custom
probably<00:02:49.200> not<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.530> much<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:50.070> still<00:02:50.670> believe

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
probably not that much I still believe

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.840 
probably not that much I still believe
that<00:02:50.940> mines<00:02:51.240> pre<00:02:51.540> accurate<00:02:52.490> but<00:02:53.490> you<00:02:53.730> know

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
that mines pre accurate but you know

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.430 
that mines pre accurate but you know
some<00:02:54.330> people<00:02:54.360> really<00:02:54.720> like<00:02:54.840> better<00:02:55.170> to<00:02:55.320> be

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
some people really like better to be

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.490 
some people really like better to be
just<00:02:55.709> gigantic<00:02:56.520> you<00:02:57.060> know<00:02:57.270> I<00:02:57.540> still<00:02:58.350> say

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
just gigantic you know I still say

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.330 
just gigantic you know I still say
that's<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.800> little<00:02:59.070> bit<00:02:59.220> Chewbacca<00:02:59.780> for<00:03:00.780> me<00:03:01.340> but

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
that's a little bit Chewbacca for me but

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.699 
that's a little bit Chewbacca for me but
you<00:03:02.940> know<00:03:03.060> I<00:03:03.239> the<00:03:03.390> beholder<00:03:03.959> I<00:03:04.170> the<00:03:04.230> beholder<00:03:04.650> I

you know I the beholder I the beholder I

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.440 
you know I the beholder I the beholder I
can<00:03:05.310> understand<00:03:05.700> some<00:03:05.880> debate<00:03:06.090> on<00:03:06.239> that<00:03:06.390> I

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
can understand some debate on that I

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.570 
can understand some debate on that I
think<00:03:06.540> that<00:03:06.870> I'm<00:03:06.989> probably<00:03:07.140> correct<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.550> that

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
think that I'm probably correct and that

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.840
