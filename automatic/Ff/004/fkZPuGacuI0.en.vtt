00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.620 
come to launch my own collection and
from<00:03:25.660> now<00:03:26.440> I<00:03:26.470> sought<00:03:27.070> the<00:03:27.310> technology<00:03:28.150> as<00:03:28.239> a

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
from now I sought the technology as a

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.740 
from now I sought the technology as a
place<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.290> important<00:03:30.100> role<00:03:30.310> in<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.820> industry

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
place so important role in the industry

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.460 
place so important role in the industry
so<00:03:32.050> I<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.650> will<00:03:33.180> do<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.450> technology<00:03:35.230> things

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
so I I will do the technology things

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.840 
so I I will do the technology things
when<00:03:35.800> i<00:03:35.830> launched<00:03:36.340> my<00:03:36.430> own<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:38.080> line<00:03:38.290> then<00:03:38.850> to

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
when i launched my own the line then to

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.470 
when i launched my own the line then to
maybe<00:03:40.330> use<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.440> social<00:03:41.680> media<00:03:41.890> or<00:03:42.580> anything

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
maybe use the social media or anything

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:45.810 
maybe use the social media or anything
and<00:03:43.750> i<00:03:43.959> think<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.440> for<00:03:44.650> the<00:03:44.769> future<00:03:45.160> that<00:03:45.550> are
