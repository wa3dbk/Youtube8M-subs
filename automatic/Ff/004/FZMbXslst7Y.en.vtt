it's<00:01:53.540> not<00:01:53.810> dead<00:01:54.140> because<00:01:54.409> I<00:01:54.680> can<00:01:54.860> still

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.180

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.660 

that<00:02:13.240> I<00:02:13.270> can<00:02:13.480> get<00:02:13.630> it<00:02:13.720> going<00:02:13.990> again

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
and it will scroll I care usually for a

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.199 
and it will scroll I care usually for a
minute<00:02:24.200> or<00:02:24.380> two<00:02:25.420> then<00:02:26.420> it<00:02:26.540> will<00:02:26.630> start<00:02:26.959> zooming

minute or two then it will start zooming

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:37.800
