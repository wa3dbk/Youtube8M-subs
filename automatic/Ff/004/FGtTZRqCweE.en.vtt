doing<00:00:22.590> dishes<00:00:22.769> it's<00:00:23.609> just<00:00:23.939> it<00:00:24.119> changes<00:00:24.840> your

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
doing dishes it's just it changes your

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.420 
doing dishes it's just it changes your
whole<00:00:25.109> perspective<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.859> think<00:00:26.039> about<00:00:26.250> like

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
whole perspective to think about like

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.029 
whole perspective to think about like
relaxing<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.480> someone<00:00:27.779> else's<00:00:28.080> time<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
relaxing and someone else's time to

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.429 
relaxing and someone else's time to
themselves<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.960> probably<00:00:30.960> because<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.260> have

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
themselves and probably because I have

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.170 
themselves and probably because I have
just<00:00:31.619> three<00:00:31.920> kids<00:00:32.189> hanging<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.850> me<00:00:33.000> and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
just three kids hanging on me and

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.760 
just three kids hanging on me and
drooling<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.570> me<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:33.960> spitting<00:00:34.290> up<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.530> me<00:00:34.680> at

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
drooling on me and spitting up on me at

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.680 
drooling on me and spitting up on me at
all<00:00:34.829> times<00:00:34.890> that's<00:00:35.399> probably<00:00:35.700> why<00:00:35.850> anyways

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
all times that's probably why anyways

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.060 
all times that's probably why anyways
