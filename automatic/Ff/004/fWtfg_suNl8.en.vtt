00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
what fresas means I'm gonna tap stresses

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.070 
what fresas means I'm gonna tap stresses
suppressants<00:02:46.620> is<00:02:47.030> presses<00:02:48.030> are<00:02:48.239> strawberries

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
suppressants is presses are strawberries

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.020 
suppressants is presses are strawberries
so<00:02:49.680> take<00:02:49.860> a<00:02:49.890> look<00:02:50.100> at<00:02:50.220> the<00:02:50.310> upper<00:02:50.519> left<00:02:50.730> corner

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
so take a look at the upper left corner

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.810 
so take a look at the upper left corner
you<00:02:51.420> have<00:02:51.630> three<00:02:52.050> hearts<00:02:52.380> available<00:02:52.820> that

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
you have three hearts available that

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.850 
you have three hearts available that
will<00:02:54.150> go<00:02:54.420> down<00:02:54.660> whenever<00:02:55.170> you<00:02:55.410> make<00:02:55.560> a<00:02:55.620> mistake

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
will go down whenever you make a mistake

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.550 
will go down whenever you make a mistake
so<00:02:56.489> if<00:02:56.880> you<00:02:57.000> make<00:02:57.180> more<00:02:57.390> than<00:02:57.780> three<00:02:58.170> mistakes

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
so if you make more than three mistakes

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.949 
so if you make more than three mistakes
you<00:02:58.830> have<00:02:58.860> to<00:02:59.280> start<00:02:59.550> over<00:02:59.760> again<00:02:59.910> so<00:03:00.600> this

you have to start over again so this

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:01.850 
you have to start over again so this
sentence<00:03:01.470> means

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
sentence means

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.600

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
you the correct solution which is the

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.300 
you the correct solution which is the
boy<00:03:17.970> eats<00:03:18.299> strawberries<00:03:19.140> and<00:03:19.380> take<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.040> look<00:03:20.220> at

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
boy eats strawberries and take a look at

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.100 
boy eats strawberries and take a look at
the<00:03:20.370> upper<00:03:20.549> left<00:03:20.760> corner<00:03:20.880> I<00:03:21.180> lost<00:03:21.480> one<00:03:21.780> heart

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
the upper left corner I lost one heart

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.650 
the upper left corner I lost one heart
so<00:03:22.739> here's<00:03:22.980> another<00:03:23.250> example<00:03:23.370> of<00:03:24.060> a<00:03:24.180> question

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
so here's another example of a question

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:29.170 
so here's another example of a question
it's<00:03:24.989> telling<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.040> to<00:03:26.070> type<00:03:26.400> what<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.150> hear

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:29.180 
it's telling you to type what you hear

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.440 
it's telling you to type what you hear
so<00:03:30.180> if<00:03:30.450> that's<00:03:30.690> too<00:03:31.049> fast<00:03:32.090> you<00:03:33.090> can<00:03:33.239> tap<00:03:33.420> the

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
so if that's too fast you can tap the

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.640 
so if that's too fast you can tap the
turtle<00:03:33.900> rear<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:38.310> it's<00:03:38.580> much<00:03:38.970> slower<00:03:39.360> so<00:03:40.140> let

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
turtle rear so it's much slower so let

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:45.900 
turtle rear so it's much slower so let
me<00:03:40.740> try<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:41.010> write<00:03:41.940> that<00:03:41.970> down

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:56.050 

nosotros<00:03:53.260> and<00:03:54.260> I<00:03:54.650> got<00:03:54.890> that<00:03:55.100> right<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:55.940> the

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
nosotros and I got that right so the

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.700 
nosotros and I got that right so the
translation<00:03:56.420> for<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:56.930> one<00:03:57.080> is<00:03:57.200> reread

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:57.710 
translation for that one is reread

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.880 
translation for that one is reread
newspapers<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.730> here's<00:03:59.390> another<00:03:59.540> example

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
newspapers and here's another example

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.180 
newspapers and here's another example
select<00:04:00.890> all<00:04:01.190> correct<00:04:01.780> translations<00:04:02.780> for<00:04:03.290> we

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
select all correct translations for we
