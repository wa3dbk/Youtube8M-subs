00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.780
 the gun that the oldest organ on 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.199
 Milan area 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.689
 the antegnati organ of 1554 is one 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:24.390
 tool that was restored later 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.820
 who for two years has played and is 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.250
 a restore operation was performed 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.560
 then a sprinkling of the one 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.480
 disassembly of the rods and then a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.579
 reorganization let's say about the tool 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.950
 the initiative of today precisely that falls 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.100
 in the context of the Milan spring e 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.170
 of the exhibition on bernardino luini unites 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.170
 these two events the restoration of 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.359
 instrument precisely the exhibition on luini di 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.460
 where both the monastery and asks 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:54.149
 precisely we know how to be frescoed 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.720
 and therefore a day that wants to give 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.030
 to Milanese citizens 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.030
 the day full of music and art 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.750
 the repertoire suited this instrument 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.710
 what a point a tool 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.979
 sixteenth century all that repertoire 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:02:00.009
 organ of the 5th of the seventeenth century 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:02.229
 I personally hate playing two authors 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.140
 three school authors say 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:08.039
 seventeenth-century Roman representative who 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.039
 they are girolamo frescobaldi 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.750
 bernardo pasquini and froberger that I am 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.350
 been students of marbles point of 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.350
