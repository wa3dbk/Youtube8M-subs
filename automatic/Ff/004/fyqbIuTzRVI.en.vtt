hi<00:00:00.630> everybody<00:00:00.900> this<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.350> CRS<00:00:02.040> camera<00:00:02.460> services

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
hi everybody this is CRS camera services

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:04.579 
hi everybody this is CRS camera services
with<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.120> quick<00:00:03.360> video<00:00:03.540> on<00:00:03.689> how<00:00:03.840> shutters<00:00:04.350> work

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
with a quick video on how shutters work

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.980 
with a quick video on how shutters work
on<00:00:04.799> digital<00:00:05.279> cameras<00:00:05.700> to<00:00:06.450> start<00:00:06.660> off<00:00:06.779> I

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
on digital cameras to start off I

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.720 
on digital cameras to start off I
thought<00:00:07.140> I'd<00:00:07.290> show<00:00:07.470> you<00:00:07.500> a<00:00:07.649> ccd<00:00:08.220> from<00:00:08.550> a

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
thought I'd show you a ccd from a

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.100 
thought I'd show you a ccd from a
point-and-shoot<00:00:09.240> camera

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
point-and-shoot camera

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.730 
point-and-shoot camera
this<00:00:11.040> little<00:00:11.519> guy<00:00:11.700> came<00:00:12.120> out<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.780> one<00:00:13.530> of<00:00:13.620> the

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
this little guy came out of one of the

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.890 
this little guy came out of one of the
cameras<00:00:14.309> while<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.330> was<00:00:15.540> looking<00:00:15.960> for<00:00:16.440> shutters

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900 
cameras while I was looking for shutters

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.109 
cameras while I was looking for shutters
it's<00:00:18.900> kind<00:00:19.140> of<00:00:19.230> cool-looking<00:00:19.520> I'd<00:00:20.520> show<00:00:20.820> it<00:00:20.970> to

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
it's kind of cool-looking I'd show it to

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.480 
it's kind of cool-looking I'd show it to
you<00:00:21.240> it's<00:00:21.689> kind<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.930> interesting<00:00:22.340> it's<00:00:23.340> the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
you it's kind of interesting it's the

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.710 
you it's kind of interesting it's the
back<00:00:23.730> not<00:00:24.210> very<00:00:24.390> interesting<00:00:24.900> and<00:00:26.480> here<00:00:27.480> is

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
back not very interesting and here is

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.529 
back not very interesting and here is
the<00:00:28.400> shutter<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.490> aperture<00:00:29.849> mechanism<00:00:30.449> out

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
the shutter and aperture mechanism out

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.870 
the shutter and aperture mechanism out
of<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.779> same<00:00:30.990> camera<00:00:31.529> or<00:00:31.920> that<00:00:32.070> CCD<00:00:32.520> came<00:00:32.730> out

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
of the same camera or that CCD came out

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.299 
of the same camera or that CCD came out
of<00:00:33.770> this<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.430> aperture<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.800> how<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:38.010> works

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
of this is the aperture and how it works

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.030 
of this is the aperture and how it works
is<00:00:38.730> sliding<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.510> little<00:00:39.809> guy<00:00:39.960> from<00:00:40.440> up<00:00:40.770> and

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
is sliding this little guy from up and

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.360 
is sliding this little guy from up and
down<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:42.059> opens<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.600> little<00:00:43.050> blades<00:00:43.370> up

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
down and it opens the little blades up

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.990 
down and it opens the little blades up
just<00:00:45.360> like<00:00:45.539> so<00:00:47.510> unfortunately<00:00:48.510> on<00:00:50.000> this

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
just like so unfortunately on this

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.830 
just like so unfortunately on this
particular<00:00:52.219> mechanism<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.270> little<00:00:54.600> leaf

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
particular mechanism it's a little leaf

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.369 
particular mechanism it's a little leaf
right<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.250> can't<00:00:56.550> get<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:57.379> which

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
right here that I can't get to which

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.189 
right here that I can't get to which
closes<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.609> opens<00:01:00.590> allowing<00:01:01.590> light<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:03.199 
closes and opens allowing light in and

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.990 
closes and opens allowing light in and
it<00:01:04.199> actually<00:01:04.460> is<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:06.299> little<00:01:06.990> slot<00:01:07.380> right<00:01:07.710> there

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
it actually is a little slot right there

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.440 
it actually is a little slot right there
if<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:09.180> can<00:01:09.330> see<00:01:09.600> it<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.850> that's<00:01:11.850> how<00:01:12.000> point

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
if you can see it and that's how point

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.330 
if you can see it and that's how point
shoot<00:01:12.720> shutters<00:01:13.080> work<00:01:15.650> moving<00:01:16.650> right<00:01:16.770> along

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
shoot shutters work moving right along

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.670 
shoot shutters work moving right along
this<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> shutter<00:01:18.479> out<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.930> digital<00:01:19.229> SLR

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
this is a shutter out of a digital SLR

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:25.030 
this is a shutter out of a digital SLR
camera<00:01:21.680> pretty<00:01:22.680> much<00:01:22.830> all<00:01:23.009> of<00:01:23.040> your<00:01:23.960> SLR

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
camera pretty much all of your SLR

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
camera pretty much all of your SLR
shutters<00:01:26.040> are<00:01:26.250> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.430> work<00:01:26.580> exactly<00:01:26.790> like

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
shutters are going to work exactly like

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.850 
shutters are going to work exactly like
this<00:01:27.420> one<00:01:27.650> this<00:01:28.650> came<00:01:28.950> out<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:30.650> ApS<00:01:31.650> size

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
this one this came out of a ApS size

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.649 
this one this came out of a ApS size
sensor<00:01:32.610> digital<00:01:33.509> SLR<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:35.390> like<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.450> said

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
sensor digital SLR but like I said

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.539 
sensor digital SLR but like I said
pretty<00:01:37.049> much<00:01:37.170> all<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.500> them<00:01:37.619> work<00:01:37.860> exactly

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
pretty much all of them work exactly

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.469 
pretty much all of them work exactly
like<00:01:38.700> this<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.380> so<00:01:40.610> with<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:41.880> mind<00:01:42.060> there

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
like this one so with that in mind there

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.710 
like this one so with that in mind there
are<00:01:42.540> two<00:01:43.229> curtains<00:01:44.100> as<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.299> see<00:01:45.509> right

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
are two curtains as you can see right

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.999 
are two curtains as you can see right
here<00:01:45.829> one<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.130> two<00:01:47.310> Wow<00:01:48.470> before<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:49.590> take<00:01:49.740> the

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
here one and two Wow before you take the

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.940 
here one and two Wow before you take the
picture<00:01:50.479> they<00:01:51.479> start<00:01:51.780> out<00:01:51.899> right<00:01:52.110> here<00:01:52.439> when

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
picture they start out right here when

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.160 
picture they start out right here when
you<00:01:53.100> take<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.549> picture<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.390> first<00:01:54.689> one<00:01:54.899> drops

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
you take the picture the first one drops

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.520 
you take the picture the first one drops
out<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.500> place<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.969> second<00:01:57.420> one<00:01:57.570> drops

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
out of place and the second one drops

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.410 
out of place and the second one drops
right<00:01:58.860> after<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.540> so<00:02:01.159> first<00:02:02.270> exposes<00:02:03.270> your

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
right after it so first exposes your

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.230 
right after it so first exposes your
sensor<00:02:03.860> completely<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.070> then<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.850> second

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
sensor completely and then the second

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.210 
sensor completely and then the second
closes<00:02:06.990> on

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
closes on

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.280 
closes on
now<00:02:09.220> that's<00:02:09.580> true<00:02:09.880> for<00:02:10.149> all<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.390> your<00:02:10.869> shutter

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
now that's true for all of your shutter

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.800 
now that's true for all of your shutter
speeds<00:02:11.650> right<00:02:12.069> up<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.670> till<00:02:13.240> you<00:02:13.360> get<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.660> your

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
speeds right up to till you get to your

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.790 
speeds right up to till you get to your
flash<00:02:14.680> sync<00:02:15.190> shutter<00:02:15.730> speed<00:02:16.200> anything<00:02:17.200> faster

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
flash sync shutter speed anything faster

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.830 
flash sync shutter speed anything faster
than<00:02:17.980> that<00:02:18.130> actually<00:02:18.459> works<00:02:19.330> a<00:02:19.450> little<00:02:19.630> bit

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
than that actually works a little bit

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.980 
than that actually works a little bit
differently<00:02:20.880> when<00:02:21.880> you<00:02:22.180> take<00:02:22.660> the<00:02:22.840> picture

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
differently when you take the picture

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:27.300 
differently when you take the picture
the<00:02:23.950> first<00:02:24.400> one<00:02:24.670> drops<00:02:25.000> just<00:02:25.630> like<00:02:25.900> before<00:02:26.380> but

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
the first one drops just like before but

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.160 
the first one drops just like before but
then<00:02:27.550> the<00:02:27.730> second<00:02:28.180> one<00:02:28.330> starts<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.840> drop

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
then the second one starts to drop

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.390 
then the second one starts to drop
before<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.950> other<00:02:30.310> one<00:02:30.700> hits<00:02:31.000> the<00:02:31.209> bottom<00:02:32.400> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
before the other one hits the bottom the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.290 
before the other one hits the bottom the
faster<00:02:33.880> your<00:02:34.030> shutter<00:02:34.239> speed<00:02:34.300> gets<00:02:36.300> the

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
faster your shutter speed gets the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.900 
faster your shutter speed gets the
smaller<00:02:37.720> that<00:02:38.080> little<00:02:38.350> slit<00:02:38.770> gets<00:02:39.100> this<00:02:39.670> sort

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
smaller that little slit gets this sort

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.630 
smaller that little slit gets this sort
of<00:02:40.030> wiping<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:40.720> image<00:02:41.019> across<00:02:41.410> your<00:02:42.220> sensor

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
of wiping and image across your sensor

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.580 
of wiping and image across your sensor
just<00:02:43.150> like<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:44.250> so<00:02:46.019> that's<00:02:47.019> how<00:02:47.260> shutter

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
just like that so that's how shutter

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.300 
just like that so that's how shutter
works<00:02:47.830> and<00:02:49.260> finally<00:02:50.260> we've<00:02:50.440> got<00:02:50.739> another

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
works and finally we've got another

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.630 
works and finally we've got another
digital<00:02:52.269> SLR<00:02:52.750> shutter<00:02:53.220> we're<00:02:54.220> going<00:02:54.340> to<00:02:54.400> break

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
digital SLR shutter we're going to break

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.170 
digital SLR shutter we're going to break
this<00:02:54.910> one<00:02:56.130> I'm<00:02:57.130> just<00:02:57.610> going<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.790> show<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.060> how
