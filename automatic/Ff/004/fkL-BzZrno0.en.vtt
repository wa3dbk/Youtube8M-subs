has ditched the fake leather design here
to<00:03:12.390> go<00:03:12.540> with<00:03:12.690> something<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:13.049> little<00:03:13.200> different

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
to go with something a little different

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.470 
to go with something a little different
it<00:03:13.829> still<00:03:14.340> feels<00:03:14.609> soft<00:03:15.000> to<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.180> touch<00:03:15.269> but

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:15.480 
it still feels soft to the touch but

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.599 
it still feels soft to the touch but
it's<00:03:15.870> now<00:03:15.989> riddled<00:03:16.410> with<00:03:16.500> dots<00:03:16.920> all<00:03:17.220> across

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:31.190 
which I could call a gimmick but I mean
it<00:03:29.760> could<00:03:29.849> be<00:03:29.970> useful<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.510> someone<00:03:30.750> like<00:03:30.930> Bruce
