the<00:03:20.130> block<00:03:20.640> behind<00:03:21.080> Dave<00:03:22.080> will<00:03:22.380> be<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.800> tree<00:03:23.190> and

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
the block behind Dave will be a tree and

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.060 
the block behind Dave will be a tree and
right<00:03:24.720> beside<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:25.080> tree<00:03:25.320> or<00:03:25.620> maybe<00:03:25.830> right

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
right beside the tree or maybe right

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.979 
right beside the tree or maybe right
behind<00:03:26.400> the<00:03:26.640> tree<00:03:26.910> would<00:03:27.180> be<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.420> creeper

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989
