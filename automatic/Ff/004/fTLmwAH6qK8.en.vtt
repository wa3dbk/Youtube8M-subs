00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 and hello all were at the doors and 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.589
 at candles this point fr is today 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.720
 we meet to show you how 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.059
 update the firmware of your wii 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.400
 play off so the little system that runs 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.980
 the board computer and the gps your 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.450
 peugeot or citroÃ«n so for example here 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.210
 it will be a 308 but it is valid 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.230
 also on the 3008 the c4 picasso 's 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.230
 c4 etc 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.830
 or 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.450
 so before proceeding to update 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.989
 we will check the whitney version 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.480
 so we will start the vehicle 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.140
 to avoid entering economy mode 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.330
 energy 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.489
 then the small screen opens if it is 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:04.250
 not the case you press here so what 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.400
 chrtr fight is that we will pay then 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.560
 by default it is here then focus 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.970
 please we will press the small 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.550
 setup button 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:16.460
 we will then go with the wheel here 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.619
 on the system settings tab we go 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.570
 then on software version we press 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.220
 and you can see that this is the 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.130
 software version so here you go back to 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.560
 the 33 to air 33 0 4 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.050
 so we will proceed with the update 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.399
 so before that you need of course 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.789
 the software you will find on 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:38.240
 google a sd card so by default you 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:40.009
 here is the nd map of gps then 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.649
 what you are going to do is good 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.860
 happen a whole back on the menu 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:48.140
 home you will remove the card sd 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.840
 here is a support on it and that 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:55.880
 go out then we come back here 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:59.869
 so here's sd cards that contains the 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.290
 software updates we serve them here 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.180
 so the system recognizes immediately 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:07.549
 the update it tells us the setting 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:11.000
 day system will start then on yes or 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.760
 not is pressed here is updated 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.290
 current system be sure not to cut 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.070
 the engine otherwise it would be enough 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.440
 dramatic 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.570
 you can of course rolled during the 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.079
 update but do not cut 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.079
 engine 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.760
 normal after 20 minutes 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.950
 approximately two updates so 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:45.829
 the most outrageous between that is that he 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:48.319
 fault let the engine on so at 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.879
 idle for 20 minutes or in the 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.459
 best case you want during the 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:54.530
 update then once the update 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:56.659
 day ended so you have a little 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:01.069
 message that tell you that it's 

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:03.349
 well done we press ok here it is 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:13.819
 go see what's happening now in 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:16.340
 the software version no so here it is 

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:18.769
 must remember to remove the card sd 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.840
 now containing the update 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.480
 since otherwise the system will restart 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.659
 above and will offer you at each 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.169
 restart 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:33.919
 the update 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:36.790
 so I put my GPS card here 

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:40.150
 not press 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.340
 we will now go back to the socket 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.000
 auxiliary because the music is a 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.239
 little boring 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:48.129
 here to check now that 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.890
 it was a day goes back again 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.870
 on this up we will now go on 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.159
 system settings then focus 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:04:01.900
 when you want here we go on version 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:03.849
 software update we are in 33 b 33 09 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.590
 so the update worked well 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:07.930
 for those who would ask the question 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.349
 why I do not film but the nex 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.230
 the answer is in the video since here 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:19.120
 in fact rather this is the SD card of 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:21.160
 monex that's why I do not have 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.990
 other cards it was so theo for 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.849
 theo bullish not fr I hope this 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.199
 video you will have if you have any 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.910
 questions do not hesitate in 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.479
 blog comments or in the chain 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.460
