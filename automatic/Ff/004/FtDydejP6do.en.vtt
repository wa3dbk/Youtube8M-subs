little<00:02:11.430> bit<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.790> a<00:02:11.850> myth<00:02:12.090> so<00:02:14.690> people<00:02:15.690> think<00:02:15.870> it

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
little bit of a myth so people think it

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.220

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
I'm doing the two layers but I think if

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.000

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.710 
both layers in this particular video I
decided<00:02:30.170> to<00:02:30.500> use<00:02:30.709> sections<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.640> the<00:02:32.150> same<00:02:32.390> lace

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720
