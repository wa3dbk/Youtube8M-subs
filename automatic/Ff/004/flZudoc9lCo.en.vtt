I'd actually have a normal ds2 show to
compare<00:00:52.230> with<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:53.370> I'm<00:00:53.879> just<00:00:54.120> guessing

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
compare with this but I'm just guessing

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.090

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
back that slides right down and you can

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.420 
back that slides right down and you can
put<00:01:01.440> three<00:01:01.920> games<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.370> there<00:01:02.550> as<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.480> can<00:01:03.510> see

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
put three games in there as you can see

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.679 
put three games in there as you can see
if<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.729> three<00:01:05.939> games<00:01:06.180> and<00:01:07.490> a<00:01:08.490> dear<00:01:09.390> slight
