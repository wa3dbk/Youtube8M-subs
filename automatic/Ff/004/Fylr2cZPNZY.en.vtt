00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.650
 a very fine rate at the time it squeezes 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:38.830

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.720
 what are you think I played bar 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:17.530
 multinational in his personal opinion is 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:19.989
 a very creative show has a future and is 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.390
 a game that runs on any pc same 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.150
 be how it will work 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.070
 it's not normal it 's framed I think it 's 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.680
 a show that is going to have a future will sell 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.340
