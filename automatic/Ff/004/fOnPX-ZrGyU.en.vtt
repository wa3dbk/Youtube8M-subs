hello so today's video is going to be me

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.749 
hello so today's video is going to be me
testing<00:00:03.570> out<00:00:03.689> the<00:00:04.110> new<00:00:04.140> Beauty<00:00:04.830> Bay<00:00:05.009> blending

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
testing out the new Beauty Bay blending

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.690 
testing out the new Beauty Bay blending
sponge<00:00:05.940> and<00:00:06.420> it<00:00:07.200> looks<00:00:07.560> exactly<00:00:08.069> like<00:00:08.280> the

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
sponge and it looks exactly like the

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.280 
sponge and it looks exactly like the
Beauty<00:00:08.970> Blender<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.599> it<00:00:09.780> claims<00:00:10.050> to

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
Beauty Blender and it claims to

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.140 
Beauty Blender and it claims to
basically<00:00:10.710> do<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.040> exact<00:00:11.550> same<00:00:11.580> as<00:00:12.030> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
basically do the exact same as the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.060 
basically do the exact same as the
Beauty<00:00:12.420> Blender<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.620> where<00:00:13.799> I<00:00:13.830> looks

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
Beauty Blender this is where I looks

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.050 
Beauty Blender this is where I looks
like<00:00:15.139> it<00:00:16.139> comes<00:00:16.410> in<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:17.160> range<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:18.000> different

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
like it comes in a range of different

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.900 
like it comes in a range of different
colors<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.380> comes<00:00:19.560> in<00:00:19.710> yellow<00:00:20.340> purple

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
colors and it comes in yellow purple

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.960 
colors and it comes in yellow purple
white<00:00:21.449> black<00:00:21.930> pink<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.920> think<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.820> might<00:00:23.939> be

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
white black pink I think that might be

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.000 
white black pink I think that might be
it<00:00:24.090> but<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.810> is<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.320> much<00:00:25.350> cheaper<00:00:25.859> than<00:00:25.949> the

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
it but this is so much cheaper than the

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.259 
it but this is so much cheaper than the
Beauty<00:00:26.279> Blender<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.880> actually<00:00:27.150> only

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
Beauty Blender this is actually only

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.960 
Beauty Blender this is actually only
five<00:00:27.660> pound<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.650> a<00:00:29.220> beauty<00:00:29.580> we<00:00:29.699> do

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
five pound and a beauty we do

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.350 
five pound and a beauty we do
international<00:00:30.840> free<00:00:31.080> shipping<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:32.360> that's

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
international free shipping so that's

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.330 
international free shipping so that's
amazing<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.079> I'm<00:00:34.170> hoping<00:00:34.590> it's<00:00:34.800> gonna<00:00:34.920> be<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
amazing so I'm hoping it's gonna be the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.220 
amazing so I'm hoping it's gonna be the
exact<00:00:35.700> same<00:00:35.940> as<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.630> hopefully<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.079> is<00:00:37.200> a

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
exact same as that and hopefully it is a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.260 
exact same as that and hopefully it is a
dupe<00:00:37.530> because<00:00:37.860> spending<00:00:38.100> 16<00:00:38.640> pound<00:00:38.969> or<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
dupe because spending 16 pound or a

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.260 
dupe because spending 16 pound or a
sponge<00:00:39.750> it's<00:00:40.710> a<00:00:40.829> bit<00:00:40.950> steep<00:00:41.219> i<00:00:41.430> think<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.059> i

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
sponge it's a bit steep i think and i

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.660 
sponge it's a bit steep i think and i
know<00:00:42.360> i<00:00:42.480> did<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:42.930> you<00:00:43.620> know<00:00:44.219> i<00:00:44.250> did<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.550> was

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
know i did it and you know i did it was

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.850 
know i did it and you know i did it was
work<00:00:45.000> what<00:00:45.420> i<00:00:45.450> could<00:00:45.510> afford<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.469> know<00:00:46.590> it

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
work what i could afford it you know it

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.819 
work what i could afford it you know it
is<00:00:47.010> it<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.460> very<00:00:47.820> expensive<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.690> spend<00:00:49.410> that

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
is it is very expensive to spend that

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.670 
is it is very expensive to spend that
much<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.579> sponge<00:00:50.940> so<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:52.170> this<00:00:52.500> is

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
much just on a sponge so and this is

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.990 
much just on a sponge so and this is
just<00:00:52.829> the<00:00:52.920> package<00:00:53.219> that<00:00:53.399> comes<00:00:53.520> in<00:00:53.699> which<00:00:53.789> are

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
just the package that comes in which are

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.470 
just the package that comes in which are
a<00:00:54.059> super<00:00:54.420> food<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.020> i<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.530> is<00:00:55.739> um<00:00:56.120> like<00:00:57.120> a

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
a super food and i think is um like a

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.189 
a super food and i think is um like a
better<00:00:58.370> size<00:00:59.370> box<00:01:00.329> because<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.690> box<00:01:00.989> the

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
better size box because the box the

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.569 
better size box because the box the
Beauty<00:01:01.440> Blender<00:01:01.530> comes<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.039> which<00:01:02.129> i'll<00:01:02.280> grab

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
Beauty Blender comes in which i'll grab

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.830 
Beauty Blender comes in which i'll grab
now<00:01:03.979> it's<00:01:04.979> actually<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.790> big<00:01:06.060> is<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> bit<00:01:06.479> duty

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
now it's actually this big is a bit duty

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.090 
now it's actually this big is a bit duty
because<00:01:06.960> i<00:01:07.140> always<00:01:07.320> go<00:01:07.530> back<00:01:07.650> in<00:01:07.830> there<00:01:07.920> but

because i always go back in there but
that's<00:01:08.310> how<00:01:08.400> big<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:09.680> if<00:01:10.680> you've<00:01:10.890> come<00:01:10.920> is
