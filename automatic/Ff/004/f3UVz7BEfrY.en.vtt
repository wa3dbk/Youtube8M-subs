00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 as for occasions when they have read 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.250
 any fashion publication or have you seen 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.470
 a video tutorial like this have you 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.840
 talked about what is the pattern of a 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.580
 tissue do not mix tissue patterns 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.230
 same uses a pattern of tissues of 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.440
 one way uses the tissue pattern 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.199
 from another but you really know what it is 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:23.070
 the pattern of a fabric I am bere squares 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:28.279
 greetings from Spain and this video will 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.279
 will teach what a tissue pattern is 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.510
 there is a fear 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.460
 most of the tissues 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.769
 indistinctly 16 if they are male or 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.190
 they are feminine they have a composition 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:52.039
 natural and then they also go have 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.519
 motives that can be line pictures 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.460
 topos stripes gives exactly the same well 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:00.769
 those reasons with which they are either 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.859
 stamped or constructed those fabrics 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:08.210
 is what we call a pattern 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:09.909
 of tissue let's take an example with 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.609
 a tissue 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.340
 here we have a diplomatic line in 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:18.280
 charcoal gray and if we go to the fabric 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.619
 just superior we would have the same 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.229
 stripe but instead of gray marengo 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:26.649
 we are using a marine observes 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:29.259
 well the lines as you will see coincide in 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:32.310
 width and match in drawings this 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.289
 tissue and this other tissue would have 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.209
 exactly the same pattern we put 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.429
 another example here we have a mini medium 

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:41.560
 with a much wider line than in 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.989
 the previous example if we go to 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:47.110
 woven just inferior we will see that 

00:01:43.989 --> 00:01:50.259
 perfectly matches the width of the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.759
 Stripe width is the same drawing with 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.869
 what we would be talking about the same 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:59.289
 pattern and we continue with the case fairly 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.420
 below but see a difference the 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.770
 woven just that we have from below 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:09.789
 is the line is quite clear influences 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:12.940
 the color in the pattern of the tissue not the 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.540
 knitting pattern is a single drawing 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.300
 it is not the color change that produces 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.160
 each one of those drawings now I'm going to 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.710
 put an example 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.710
 visualizing picture a prince of wales 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.590
 as you will observe we have this prince of 

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:31.450
 wales at the bottom we have another 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.060
 Prince of Wales coincide 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.920
 perfectly the pictures match 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.260
 perfectly the pattern and the only thing 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.200
 we have the bigger picture the table 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:43.990
 upper window we have it in blue and what 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.600
 we have in red that is the difference 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.910
 nothing else with what comes back to fulfill 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.050
 the standard we change colors but the 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.730
 pattern is still exactly the same 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.400
 we have used the fabrics for suit 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.440
 to show you the patterns but if 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.140
 we use the fabric for shirt is the 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.840
 example is much more visual as 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.730
 can observe 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.160
 it's the same pattern that we've been 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.849
 speaking in the tissue we are going to translate it 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.110
 in shirt fabrics all these models 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:18.959
 of stripe would be the same pattern we change 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:22.680
 to a much wider line and everything 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.569
 this what we consider a pattern all 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.580
 this striped pattern indistinctly from 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.709
 the colors we are seeing that they continue 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.410
 being the same pattern 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.989
 even in a micro-ray as we have 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:35.400
 here and a little box bichi a little picture 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.470
 very tiny 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.160
 we are fulfilling the same rule of 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:44.250
 pattern drawings the same indistinctly 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.110
 the color that you have honestly you have to 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:48.120
 make a true fashion expert and 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:51.150
 also have an exquisite taste for 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:53.610
 mix equal patterns with each other and that 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.790
 the result is the result really 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.980
 beautiful is very complicated but it is a 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.959
 work that throughout all these 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.030
 videos that we are going to go up that 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:06.209
 we will be demonstrating and we will have teaching 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.889
 those ways to do it in this case my 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.290
 advice is until that moment arrives 

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:12.209
 let's take a series 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:13.709
 huge a series of rules that I hope 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.480
 to help you very much 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.940
 imagine for a moment that you like 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.739
 Now that you would like to put on a 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.800
 tie with stripes 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.520
 if you wear a suit with a stripe 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.550
 diplomat 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:29.850
 if you use a shirt with a stripe and if 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:31.650
 in the tie you get streaks if you do not 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.979
 you do well you will end up looking like a 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:38.190
 barcode with what accept me 

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:41.610
 this advice and if you need or want 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.780
 put on a striped tie uses the 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.449
 Pattern 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.880
 of the shirt fabric completely 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.390
 smooth 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.969
 the suit or terrain use it as smooth 

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:55.269
 possible 

00:04:51.969 --> 00:04:56.709
 otherwise, we will use 

00:04:55.269 --> 00:04:59.739
 imagine that you want to put a 

00:04:56.709 --> 00:05:01.899
 completely smooth tie that does not have 

00:04:59.739 --> 00:05:02.889
 no kind of reason any kind of 

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:07.179
 Pattern 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:09.969
 You can use a shirt with a stripe but 

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:13.569
 I recommend you not to wear a suit 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:16.179
 with pinstripe wears a suit 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:19.479
 completely smooth if you follow these rules 

00:05:16.179 --> 00:05:22.439
 I guarantee you that in no time you will 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.179
 ridicule in no time you can 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:27.129
 claim that the mix you're 

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:31.360
 doing is not correct and as always 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:33.129
 you will finish in a very elegant way if 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.989
 once seen this video has produced you 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:37.539
 do you doubt or do you want to do some kind of 

00:05:34.989 --> 00:05:40.180
 suggestion uses the bottom part of 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:42.639
 the comments to leave it 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:45.820
 the reflection you have had on the 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:47.889
 issue on the other hand for us very 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.539
 important to know if this video really 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:52.000
 It has lived up to what it expects 

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:55.780
 more than what he expected from us and 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.690
 over all that like that I like we're going 

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:01.810
 to indicate that the video has really 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:03.580
 liked and to end forever 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:05.979
 I always recommend that you subscribe to 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.740
 this channel every week we are 

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:10.630
 uploading new videos videos that are going to 

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.970
 go joining the whole series of those who 

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:15.940
 we have already done and are content that you 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.560
 You should not lose yourself remember that 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:22.770
 here we are doing a very job 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.770
 hard always thinking of your elegance 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:26.880
 do not
