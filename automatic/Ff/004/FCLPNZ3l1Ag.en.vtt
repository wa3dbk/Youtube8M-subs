the<00:00:36.239> sport<00:00:36.540> over<00:00:36.690> here<00:00:36.960> I<00:00:37.290> must<00:00:38.040> say<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:38.670> think

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
the sport over here I must say I think

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.700 
the sport over here I must say I think
the<00:00:39.059> Europeans<00:00:39.719> for<00:00:40.050> Denmark<00:00:40.590> was<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.550> best

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
the Europeans for Denmark was the best

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.860 
the Europeans for Denmark was the best
ambassador<00:00:43.710> ever<00:00:44.010> I<00:00:44.850> think<00:00:45.480> also<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
ambassador ever I think also the

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.830 
ambassador ever I think also the
organisers<00:00:46.530> did<00:00:46.739> a<00:00:46.770> fantastic<00:00:47.039> job<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:48.390> sport

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
organisers did a fantastic job the sport

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.380 
organisers did a fantastic job the sport
was<00:00:49.110> great<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.860> jumping<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.820> power<00:00:51.030> are<00:00:51.270> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
was great in jumping the power are the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.840 
was great in jumping the power are the
dressage<00:00:51.629> I<00:00:52.110> mean<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:52.770> the<00:00:53.670> audience

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
dressage I mean it was the audience

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.720 
dressage I mean it was the audience
could<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.809> had<00:00:55.230> better<00:00:55.680> sport<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.370> watch

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
could not have had better sport to watch

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.610 
could not have had better sport to watch
and<00:00:57.379> I<00:00:58.379> think<00:00:59.539> Denmark<00:01:00.539> has<00:01:00.899> put<00:01:01.109> itself<00:01:01.440> a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
and I think Denmark has put itself a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.460 
and I think Denmark has put itself a
little<00:01:01.859> bit<00:01:02.010> more<00:01:02.219> onto<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.789> map<00:01:03.470> in

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
little bit more onto the map in

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.219 
little bit more onto the map in
questions<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> think<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.780> was<00:01:06.869> a<00:01:06.930> really

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
questions so I think it was a really

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.200 
questions so I think it was a really
really<00:01:07.530> good<00:01:07.860> thing<00:01:08.159> it's<00:01:08.340> taken<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.909> lot<00:01:09.030> of

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
really good thing it's taken a lot of

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.080 
really good thing it's taken a lot of
energy<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.340> sponsors<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.460> all<00:01:11.580> that<00:01:11.790> but<00:01:12.030> I

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
energy and sponsors and all that but I

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.730 
energy and sponsors and all that but I
think<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.170> effort<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.710> was<00:01:13.860> worth<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.340> and

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
think all the effort it was worth it and

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
think all the effort it was worth it and
it<00:01:16.740> was<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.890> very<00:01:17.070> emotional<00:01:17.729> weekend<00:01:18.240> for<00:01:18.420> you

and around her and all that I just try

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.099

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:20.709 
so I'm happy if she does a secure round

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:23.180 
so I'm happy if she does a secure round
where<00:03:21.220> I<00:03:21.250> can<00:03:21.519> keep<00:03:21.730> control<00:03:21.940> of<00:03:22.480> her<00:03:22.660> which<00:03:22.870> is

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
where I can keep control of her which is

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:29.069 
where I can keep control of her which is
easy<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:24.730> then<00:03:25.359> see<00:03:25.930> how<00:03:26.109> it<00:03:26.170> ends<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:28.150> so<00:03:29.019> you

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:29.079 
easy and then see how it ends and so you

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.900 
easy and then see how it ends and so you
have<00:03:29.440> a<00:03:29.470> freestyle<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.160> the<00:03:30.370> public<00:03:30.670> haven't

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
have a freestyle that the public haven't

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.660 
have a freestyle that the public haven't
seen<00:03:31.060> before<00:03:31.209> and<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:32.709> public<00:03:33.069> has<00:03:33.280> seen<00:03:33.519> it

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
seen before and the public has seen it

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.240 
seen before and the public has seen it
before<00:03:33.819> it's<00:03:34.180> Digby's<00:03:34.720> old<00:03:35.250> freestyle

before it's Digby's old freestyle

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.759

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:38.769 
because it's always difficult to really

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.879

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
very very well that's something I really

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.250 
very very well that's something I really
from<00:04:09.819> the<00:04:09.969> beginning<00:04:10.090> thought<00:04:10.629> she's<00:04:11.049> never

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
from the beginning thought she's never

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.289 
from the beginning thought she's never
going<00:04:11.500> to<00:04:11.590> learn<00:04:11.859> and<00:04:12.099> then<00:04:12.400> son<00:04:12.670> leaves<00:04:12.969> she

00:04:13.289 --> 00:04:13.299

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
sort of got the idea of it I think she

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.039 
sort of got the idea of it I think she
does<00:04:17.289> some<00:04:17.560> really<00:04:17.769> serious<00:04:18.160> series<00:04:19.090> one
