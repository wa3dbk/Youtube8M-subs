00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.930
 more the extra money a tutorial of how 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.790
 activate our screen look at houses or 

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.830
 screens miss wireless like 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.270
 you know her to be able to see in 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.770
 our screen our phone in 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.440
 our is marketing first of all 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.630
 let's activate the function of our 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.400
 television and the house in the case that is 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.410
 a gym screen depends on the brand 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.270
 once done this and already having the 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.570
 turned on the function we are going to go to 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.340
 our phone and already having 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.790
 downloaded the application that is in the 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.530
 bottom of the video 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.000
 there will be and it will appear to you from that 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.090
 way then they go to the button look here 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.680
 in my case my television and my phone 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.360
 they had already been in two and colonized 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.640
 previously so automatically 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.570
 makes the connection in your house you go 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.040
 to look for the screen and go to 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.080
 select it and on the screen they go to 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.510
 accept the connection invitation as 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.660
 20 is something very simple for this is not 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.370
 you need to make use of others or modify 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.020
 no type of file in our 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.970
 system so we have no risk of 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.970
 bric if you are not very expert in 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:13.220
 this to modify files something else very 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.619
 important is that it works on the album 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.450
 I living and the roms kitkat anyone 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.890
 that is robust or is some cover 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.570
 well here I leave you with the part of 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.729
 video where I want you to see the 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.500
 demonstrations of how they look 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.729
 function on our screen and what 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.810
 fun that is to play with our 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.060
 video game 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.590
 It should be noted that I am using 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.720
 all video games with the highest quality 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.250
 high graphics to see that 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.930
 you really do not suffer any delay anymore 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.480
 that our phone does this in a way 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.240
 the store thank you 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:46.960
 its processor more however this 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.220
 option is not in our menu but the 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.620
 simple fact of using this application 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.540
 makes you open this option as you 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.160
 I comment it is not necessary to do any 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.260
 type of system modification or 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.240
 be it so it's something very simple and 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.100
 I hope that with this is everything is already 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.320
 Of course, this topic is clear 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.630
 If you have to play some video about 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.030
 some self tutorial or something with a lot 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.709
 like games aside subscribe 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.660
 since I love making these videos 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.850
 for you but I would like very much 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.590
 know what they want them to 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.330
 show and how it is done in addition to 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.270
 show them that it really works 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.690
 thank you very much for your data 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:25.610
 this was done in a kit rom the car 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.340
 last update the rpdc without any 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.520
 type of modification in my case if I have 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.330
 broken my phone but it is not necessary 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:35.060
 as I had already told you 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.610
 previously and says that they fix then 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.170
 there really is not a very big delay 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.600
 it's less than half a second and it 's very 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.970
 normal on phones that do not have 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.840
 activated the wireless screen but 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.790
 that we activate it in another way 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.819
 the dramatic of the maximum channel is not 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.090
 usually any kind of delay I mean 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:57.129
 when controlling or that the graphs 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.420
 distortions not something do this guy to the 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.420
 We are heavy 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.630
 something that stands out is if you 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.620
 can connect a command for example 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.220
 between xbox 360 or playstation 3 through 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.870
 de de gea 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.360
 there are some very good tutorials uploaded 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.910
 about that you can also connect a 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.950
 keyboard or mouse and use our 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.560
 phone as a small mini pc 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.030
 connected on our screen will know 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.319
 I say goodbye and leave you with the video 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:29.010
 thank you very much for having seen it 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.010
