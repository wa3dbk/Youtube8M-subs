 jacques benign bowl I was getting ready to 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.289
 jump over the singing becomes when 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.789
 I realized that it was not a 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:33.760
 candle but rather a fills me with 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.379
 baby dragons spit harmful the 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.140

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.640
 your own story to sleep 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.809
 the problem is that I am under

 the hold of a spell that prevents me from 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.589
 lie and suddenly I do not know

 distort the truth good why do not you 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.980
 will not tell a true story but 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.050
 so dramatic that she 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.059
 would become almost incredible to validate 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.789
 this good since I'm going to find a 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.370
 similar story 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.350
 as you have big muscles that's 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.920

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.800

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:09.940
 choruses on the cupcakes and you dare 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.830
 to say that you are not in love this 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.039
 is not at all romantic is that 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:18.910

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:21.940
 engraved initials in one case we are not there 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:24.429
