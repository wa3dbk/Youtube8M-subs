00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.520
 good day look at the weather news 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.020
 from weerplaza.nl 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.730
 we start with the radar image fall and 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.380
 this afternoon 2:10 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.599
 heavy rainfall when pulled from 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.570
 Belgium towards the Netherlands and see it 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.789
 two cores with heavy precipitation that is the 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.840
 one and the second of course there 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.510
 southeast of 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.220
 and those two places were among others 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.640
 Most thunderstorms have a heading direction 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.960
 the east northeast that is the region 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.240
 who must take this into account 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.050
 tonight and tonight in the west and 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.460
 northwest 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.450
 rain falls but there it will 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.670
 all less heavy 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.050
 so probably that means them 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.239
 to meet a changeable evening 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.340
 involve showers over the land of south 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.829
 to north east in the northwest 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.440
 the first dry and the longest 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:49.410
 it stays wet along the eastern border 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.550
 temperatures 18 to 22 degrees 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.350
 tonight the rain will move to 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.879
 germany road and at the end of the 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.710
 night this is the situation 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.809
 12 degrees and zealand is already there 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.340
 cleared up but in the east it is pit 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.960
 of the country though there are still cloud fields 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.609
 and there is also a degree or 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.379
 seventeen 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.570
 I also draw those clouds and tomorrow during the day 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.770
 largely way to have hefty 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.479
 sunny periods 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.070
 the pressure starts to rise makes 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.020
 make sure that the chance of a shower is minimal 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.729
 perhaps another one in limburg because of this 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.250
 but even there the chance is small 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.740
 in Limburg the highest temperatures 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.390
 25 degrees next to the west coast will turn 20 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.460
 degrees after bite and weak to moderate 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.280
 wind from the sea and on the Wadden Islands 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.530
 it will be 18 to 20 degrees 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.840
 great weather tomorrow so after nice weather 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.640
 we actually keep that on Thursday 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.409
 and on Friday even then it is 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.270
 high pressure area still in front of the door 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.369
 even then dry weather and good sunny weather 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.740
 periods but the clouds do 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.820
 something in comparison with tomorrow 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.770
 the wind gradually turns towards it 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.460
 north and temperature to something else 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.439
 fall 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.869
 on Friday it is 18 degrees up from the age of 17 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.880
 the ramparts and 22 degrees inland 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.170
 but that is of course pretty nice weather 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.790
 type 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.710
 Saturday the high-pressure area will disappear 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.200
 then the chance of a shower increases that 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.490
 also applies to Sunday 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.170
 we take a look at the longer ones 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.509
 in the long term and in particular with regard to the 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.520
 temperature we see it Wednesday until 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.500
 Friday is more than 20 years 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.810
 at the weekend we see a solid one 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.830
 decrease to temperatures from 16 to 20 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.880
 degrees 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.440
 but the longer term leaves lord 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.300
 very slowly an ascending line 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.850
 so see 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.310
 cooler weather in mid-June and so on 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.590
 towards the 20th and 25th the 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.410
 temperatures rise again or far 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.420
 away we wait quietly but a tip 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:29.950
 our website weerplaza.nl I have a 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.480
 article put with all photos of 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.990
 yesterday from the heavy weather 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:37.120
 and worth watching some nice videos 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.080
 wish you a nice evening i'm beginning 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.100
