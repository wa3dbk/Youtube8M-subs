00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:14.040
 every day that passes we see more and more 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.139
 news about the different glasses 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.270
 virtual reality and how several companies 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.430
 compete to create the best version of 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.260
 this the truth occurred to me to tell you 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.480
 dear ones I have the mind on this 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.180
 technology and as in my opinion when 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.619
 it's finished revolutionized not only 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.599
 the videogames but the whole world 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.099
 let's do one thing let's travel ten 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.020
 years to the future imagine that the 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.610
 technology is already perfected and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.470
 we do not have to worry about this 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.170
 It's worth how we could use it where 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.149
 it works where it does not divide it into different 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.309
 steps but you can that several of these 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.199
 steps then in Alberto some were a 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.789
 little more adapted others less just not 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.690
 matter is simply to get organized 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.940
 a little bit 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.890
 step one we have to take into account the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.510
 feeling of being in the place that 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.370
 I want to say that although our 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.859
 main way to receive information 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:00.359
 be the view is not the only one in the case 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.300
 that the player is the reality 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.339
 virtual and his physical movements do not 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.410
 they have with what represented this 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:09.390
 will extract from the game and frustrate a 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.520
 heap because it will not make you feel in 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.830
 control then seen those videos in which 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.060
 see the guys with the oculus begin to 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.799
 fall backwards or sideways 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.220
 because in the game you saw a mountain 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.960
 russian 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.150
 that was because for them the world 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.850
 I was moving towards where they do not want 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.290
 I will go to the cliff 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.180
 let's say some can propose to use 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.070
 a command and it will undoubtedly be part of the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.560
 transition but it will not work many 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.750
 games imagined the fps of the day the 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.400
 weapon comes out from under your face with each 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.140
 turn of your head the weapon would move 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.670
 with you in that era is probably 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.530
 focuses on games with which better 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.090
 this type of technology works what 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.920
 these are the ones that the player is 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.920
 in a fixed position as well as those of 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.780
 racing or one of tanks or the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.430
 airplane simulator I always 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.200
 I imagine controlling a giant robot and 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.240
 using the buttons to control it 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.130
 I think it would be amazing and very, very 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.570
 immersive the second step I think that 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.400
 it would be an evolution of the controls 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.020
 I think the most viable option to do it 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.970
 and in fact they are already working on it 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.590
 that of several receivers in the room 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.420
 or similar to when the dolby is installed 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.670
 surround place multiple receivers 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.649
 movement the four corners or walls 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.870
 the room and that they may well 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.730
 consider your movements you will no longer be 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.770
 playing the game with a controller but 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.930
 you will be inside him may still 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.209
 you need a we type control to trace 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.040
 your movements if you use it as a weapon 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.580
 for example the reason is just because 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.680
 take it off 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.050
 vectors are not as accurate as they are 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.760
 because a certain level of tactile stimulation 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.310
 can facilitate you when handling 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.590
 the game feel you squeeze the trigger 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.180
 or that you push the door when you move your hand 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.980
 you understand, I think this way is a lot 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.690
 more viable than any tape for 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.700
 follow your movements in my opinion is 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.620
 too expensive difficult and cumbersome as 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.480
 to convince the entire public to 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.000
 play with that treadmill step 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.040
 number 3 explore it in the rest of the 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.630
 sectors I do not know if some of you play 3 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.550
 when you were children but imagine yourself 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.470
 a second those places of battles that 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.060
 laser firing laser guns 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.040
 to each other but with glasses 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.720
 of virtual reality would have created a 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.340
 environment that everything is mapped in the 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.500
 You are no longer playing in your city 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.750
 you and your friends are attacking ships in 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.280
 flames beyond orion would no longer have 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.860
 why be two teams can be created 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.360
 enemies with artificial intelligence 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.100
 giant monsters whatever and you 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.110
 you could be shooting with the glazers 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.120
 what would happen if we used in others 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:20.070
 means imagine that eminem gives a 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.959
 new york 'concert and put a camera 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.150
 of virtual reality there you can be in 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.980
 live watching the concert of turning and 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:28.380
 so you would see the whole audience what 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.610
 doing next to you would be practically 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.560
 as if I were there 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.440
 there is not the thing that you think about the 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.350
 idea of traveling and seeing faraway places me 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.180
 I mean very very far 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.920
 imaginary guys for a moment what 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:43.020
 strong that it would be for humanity to be able 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:45.600
 see with our own eyes the moon or 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.880
 even marte walk through where 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.830
 We want this place to be able to look at the sky 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.320
 and see us as a little blue marble in 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.210
 the vastness of space talking about 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.100
 marte imagine the strength that 

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.810
 would get this project if any 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.450
 we could see what the first 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.520
 explorers have managed to walk by 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.620
 where they have walked to be able to look at 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.020
 sky and observe space as never before 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.670
 we had seen and all this while roaring 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.070
 the strong wind on Mars against 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.990
 our ears this is a journey of years 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:14.640
 an impossible trip for most of the 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.530
 humanity but thanks to this technology 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.780
 we could be part of this 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:20.460
 I experience being part of the next 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.440
 great adventure that explores the 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.450
 humanity is a science fiction but it is 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.910
 possible we have already mapped the majority of 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.290
 the cities with the google streetview 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.360
 imagine this with high definition and in 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:31.980
 some of these fantastic places already 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.560
 will not be the achievement of a single euro to 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.420
 cross the space will not be the victory of 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.370
 a country but we will all be 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:40.620
 participants of the greatest achievements of the 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.720
 humanity are many years away but I am 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.160
 eager to see what lies ahead because 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.600
 I really believe that this technology 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.670
 will already make us understand how close 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.360
 we are from each other and how much 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.360
 we can advance
