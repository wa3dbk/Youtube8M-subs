00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.759
 It's cool a lot of uncle much improves this map 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:34.770
 because the medium is very heart or is the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.590
 back if you are going to see the heart or 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.860
 what is it is that here you have to go to sack 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.149
 It's worth to pins and the medium 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.920
