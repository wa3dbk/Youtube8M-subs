00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.630 
I'll try to get some shots of the day
just<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.610> see<00:01:43.189> if<00:01:44.189> there's<00:01:44.399> any

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
just so you can see if there's any

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.499 
just so you can see if there's any
changing<00:01:45.500> because<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.680> think<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.729> know<00:01:47.939> this

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
changing because I think you know this

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.080 
changing because I think you know this
is<00:01:48.570> really<00:01:48.840> helping<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.500> with<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.189> dryness<00:01:50.520> so

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
is really helping it with the dryness so

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.819 
is really helping it with the dryness so
I<00:01:51.360> am<00:01:52.110> going<00:01:52.350> to<00:01:52.470> continue<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:53.280> do<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:54.710> use<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
I am going to continue to do it use the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.160 
I am going to continue to do it use the
same<00:01:56.040> products<00:01:56.759> I'm<00:01:56.939> not<00:01:57.149> switching<00:01:57.360> products

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
same products I'm not switching products

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.709 
same products I'm not switching products
I'm<00:01:59.070> just<00:01:59.219> keep<00:01:59.490> consistent<00:02:00.180> what<00:02:00.420> I'm<00:02:00.540> using

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
I'm just keep consistent what I'm using

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.280 
I'm just keep consistent what I'm using
because<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.170> feel<00:02:01.469> this<00:02:01.619> working<00:02:02.390> I<00:02:03.390> dip<00:02:03.869> use

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
because I feel this working I dip use

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:08.570 
because I feel this working I dip use
the<00:02:04.500> extreme<00:02:04.979> jail<00:02:05.340> too<00:02:05.869> on<00:02:06.869> top<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.580> chest

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
the extreme jail too on top of the chest

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.279 
the extreme jail too on top of the chest
am<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.879> nap

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
am a nap

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.259 
am a nap
for<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.649> whole<00:02:09.829> so<00:02:10.280> maybe<00:02:10.549> that's<00:02:10.789> why<00:02:10.939> I<00:02:10.969> still

00:02:11.259 --> 00:02:11.269 
for a whole so maybe that's why I still

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.690 
for a whole so maybe that's why I still
have<00:02:11.420> crew<00:02:11.659> cuz<00:02:12.019> I'm<00:02:12.170> Johnny<00:02:12.829> one<00:02:13.579> of<00:02:13.640> these

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
have crew cuz I'm Johnny one of these

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.000 
have crew cuz I'm Johnny one of these
times<00:02:13.909> i<00:02:14.120> might<00:02:14.299> try<00:02:14.329> without<00:02:14.870> Jill<00:02:15.379> just<00:02:15.859> to

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
times i might try without Jill just to

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.750 
times i might try without Jill just to
see<00:02:16.250> what<00:02:17.150> the<00:02:17.269> results<00:02:17.750> are<00:02:17.900> but<00:02:18.280> I'm<00:02:19.280> digging

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
see what the results are but I'm digging

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.330 
see what the results are but I'm digging

more<00:02:25.489> consistent<00:02:25.819> with<00:02:26.030> updates<00:02:26.450> because

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
more consistent with updates because

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.720 
more consistent with updates because
