00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
decided to put together those

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:34.780 
decided to put together those
demonstrations<00:00:32.780> because<00:00:33.650> seeing<00:00:34.460> what

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
demonstrations because seeing what

demonstrations because seeing what
should<00:00:34.970> be<00:00:35.120> done<00:00:35.300> is<00:00:35.570> much<00:00:36.170> easier<00:00:36.680> than

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
should be done is much easier than

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.950 
should be done is much easier than

then without moving the upper arms you

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.000 
then without moving the upper arms you
start<00:00:57.799> curling<00:00:58.220> the<00:00:58.909> dumbbells<00:00:59.750> toward<00:01:00.589> your

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.740 

now<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.220> hard<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.640> iron<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.150> someone<00:01:15.570> who

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
now it's hard to iron with someone who

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.040 
now it's hard to iron with someone who
had<00:01:15.990> horses<00:01:16.650> walk<00:01:17.400> over<00:01:17.880> him<00:01:18.060> on<00:01:18.240> planks<00:01:18.900> but

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
had horses walk over him on planks but

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.050 
had horses walk over him on planks but
there<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.320> still<00:01:19.590> two<00:01:20.130> things<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.760> would<00:01:20.910> like

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
there are still two things I would like

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.990 
there are still two things I would like
to<00:01:21.210> remark<00:01:21.600> about<00:01:21.840> that<00:01:22.290> exercise<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.340> number

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
to remark about that exercise and number

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.810 
to remark about that exercise and number
ones<00:01:24.210> you<00:01:24.810> need<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.440> use<00:01:25.710> very<00:01:26.070> small<00:01:26.220> weights

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
ones you need to use very small weights

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.590 
ones you need to use very small weights
because<00:01:27.480> the<00:01:28.350> weight<00:01:28.610> rests<00:01:29.610> at<00:01:29.760> the<00:01:29.820> end<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
because the weight rests at the end of a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.850 
because the weight rests at the end of a
very<00:01:31.350> long<00:01:31.920> lever<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:33.030> is<00:01:33.090> your<00:01:33.870> arm<00:01:34.350> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
very long lever that is your arm and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.440 
very long lever that is your arm and
number<00:01:35.430> two<00:01:35.610> when<00:01:35.940> you<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.420> exercise

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
number two when you do the exercise

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.910 
number two when you do the exercise
there<00:01:37.440> is<00:01:37.650> constant<00:01:38.490> static<00:01:39.390> stress<00:01:40.050> on<00:01:40.650> your

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
there is constant static stress on your

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.550 
there is constant static stress on your
shoulders<00:01:41.400> so<00:01:41.790> when<00:01:41.970> you<00:01:42.060> try<00:01:42.390> this<00:01:42.450> out<00:01:42.810> make

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
shoulders so when you try this out make

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.100 
shoulders so when you try this out make
it<00:01:43.710> really<00:01:44.160> short<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:44.730> see<00:01:44.970> how<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.600> should

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
it really short to see how you should

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.590 
it really short to see how you should
react<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.220> they<00:01:47.700> may<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.210> all<00:01:48.360> be<00:01:48.390> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
react to it they may have to all be a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.960 
react to it they may have to all be a
good<00:01:48.900> reason<00:01:49.140> why<00:01:49.620> no<00:01:49.800> one<00:01:50.190> did<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.460> exercise

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
good reason why no one did this exercise

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.630 
good reason why no one did this exercise
in<00:01:51.240> about<00:01:51.480> 100<00:01:51.960> years<00:01:52.230> or<00:01:52.470> so<00:01:52.500> because<00:01:53.130> your

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
in about 100 years or so because your

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.590 
in about 100 years or so because your
biceps<00:01:54.120> here<00:01:54.210> gets<00:01:54.960> very<00:01:55.850> small<00:01:56.850> range<00:01:57.390> of

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
biceps here gets very small range of

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.590 
biceps here gets very small range of
useful<00:01:57.840> motion<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.680> all<00:01:59.310> this<00:01:59.490> stress<00:02:00.120> for

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
useful motion and all this stress for

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.450 
useful motion and all this stress for
the<00:02:00.720> shoulder<00:02:01.080> is<00:02:01.200> also<00:02:01.620> there<00:02:01.830> so<00:02:02.130> when<00:02:02.430> you

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
the shoulder is also there so when you

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.469 
the shoulder is also there so when you
try<00:02:02.820> this<00:02:02.880> out<00:02:03.210> then<00:02:03.860> do<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.979> for<00:02:05.010> novelty<00:02:05.910> but

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
try this out then do it for novelty but

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.770 
try this out then do it for novelty but
whatever<00:02:06.900> you<00:02:07.110> do<00:02:07.320> keep<00:02:07.580> close<00:02:08.580> tabs<00:02:09.000> on<00:02:09.300> how

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
whatever you do keep close tabs on how

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.080 
whatever you do keep close tabs on how
especially<00:02:10.440> your<00:02:10.740> shoulders<00:02:11.250> react<00:02:11.820> to<00:02:11.970> it

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
especially your shoulders react to it

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.760 
especially your shoulders react to it
and<00:02:12.300> if<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.660> does<00:02:12.870> anything<00:02:13.290> useful<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:15.060> so

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
and if it does anything useful to you so

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.220 
and if it does anything useful to you so
try<00:02:16.770> this<00:02:16.830> 100<00:02:17.610> year<00:02:17.820> old<00:02:17.850> exercise<00:02:18.630> out<00:02:18.930> as
