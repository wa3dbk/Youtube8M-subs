up all of the plastic and areas which
means<00:00:24.990> this<00:00:25.170> nicer<00:00:26.010> for<00:00:26.460> overall<00:00:26.789> usability

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:27.500

the<00:00:28.500> bathro<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.099> exactly<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.670> same<00:00:33.590> it's

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the bathro is exactly the same it's

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.040 
the bathro is exactly the same it's
still<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.920> same<00:00:35.180> so<00:00:36.180> basically<00:00:36.719> pretty<00:00:36.960> much

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
still the same so basically pretty much

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.720 
still the same so basically pretty much
the<00:00:37.380> same<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:37.950> just<00:00:38.010> looks<00:00:38.370> a<00:00:38.489> little<00:00:38.520> bit

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
the same it just looks a little bit

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.030 
the same it just looks a little bit
cleaner<00:00:38.940> there's<00:00:39.329> less<00:00:39.480> clutter<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.829> those

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
cleaner there's less clutter and those

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.740 
cleaner there's less clutter and those
bungees<00:00:41.489> about<00:00:41.760> hidden<00:00:42.000> which<00:00:42.329> it's<00:00:42.510> kind<00:00:42.690> of

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
bungees about hidden which it's kind of

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.310 
bungees about hidden which it's kind of
nice<00:00:42.899> they<00:00:43.170> don't<00:00:43.350> get<00:00:43.500> hammered<00:00:43.739> by<00:00:43.980> the<00:00:44.010> Sun

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:45.320

fun<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.300> play<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.930> loved<00:00:55.770> last<00:00:56.070> year's

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
fun to play with I loved last year's

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.520 
fun to play with I loved last year's
this<00:00:56.940> year's<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.390> very<00:00:57.629> very<00:00:57.899> similar

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
this year's is very very similar

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.040 
this year's is very very similar
you've<00:00:59.219> got<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.489> 5<00:00:59.730> strut<00:01:00.300> design<00:01:00.690> again

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
you've got the 5 strut design again

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.590 
you've got the 5 strut design again
giving<00:01:01.440> rigidity<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.129> wing<00:01:02.399> tips<00:01:02.670> for

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
giving rigidity to the wing tips for

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.210 
giving rigidity to the wing tips for
turning<00:01:04.049> potentially<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> little<00:01:04.769> bit<00:01:04.979> slower

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
turning potentially a little bit slower

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.660 
turning potentially a little bit slower
than<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.869> 2011<00:01:06.869> version<00:01:07.130> but<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.220> wouldn't<00:01:08.490> say

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
than the 2011 version but I wouldn't say

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.539 
than the 2011 version but I wouldn't say
much<00:01:09.470> the<00:01:10.470> best<00:01:10.680> thing<00:01:10.860> about<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.430> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
much the best thing about it is the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.250 
much the best thing about it is the
pivotal<00:01:11.970> turning<00:01:12.180> which<00:01:12.540> for<00:01:12.720> wave<00:01:12.869> ride<00:01:13.110> is

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
pivotal turning which for wave ride is

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.530 
pivotal turning which for wave ride is

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
well it means on-demand power that you

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:20.660 
well it means on-demand power that you
can<00:01:17.340> choose<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.790> use<00:01:17.820> or<00:01:18.390> not<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.250> D<00:01:20.430> power

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
can choose to use or not and the D power

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.969 
can choose to use or not and the D power
once<00:01:20.939> again<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.540> like<00:01:21.659> all<00:01:21.900> times<00:01:22.770> would

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
once again just like all times would

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.560 
once again just like all times would
have<00:01:23.130> that<00:01:23.310> continuous<00:01:23.670> leading<00:01:24.210> edge<00:01:24.360> it's

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
have that continuous leading edge it's

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.929 
have that continuous leading edge it's
really<00:01:25.439> really<00:01:25.619> decent<00:01:26.040> so<00:01:26.250> again<00:01:26.640> you've<00:01:26.820> got

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
really really decent so again you've got

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.929 
really really decent so again you've got
a<00:01:26.970> large<00:01:27.420> range<00:01:27.720> with<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> kind<00:01:28.320> so

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
a large range with the kind so

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.069 
a large range with the kind so
essentially<00:01:29.939> a<00:01:29.970> couple<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.600> kites<00:01:30.810> in<00:01:30.960> your

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
essentially a couple of kites in your

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.050 
essentially a couple of kites in your
quiver<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.380> you'll<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.590> good<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.770> go

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:32.060 
quiver and you'll be good to go
