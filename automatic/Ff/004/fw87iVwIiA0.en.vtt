portion<00:00:58.829> because<00:00:59.160> it's<00:00:59.340> very<00:00:59.489> simplified

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
portion because it's very simplified

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.740 
portion because it's very simplified
almost<00:01:01.710> abstract<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.730> there's<00:01:02.910> no<00:01:03.149> real<00:01:03.449> fine

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
almost abstract so there's no real fine

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.990 
almost abstract so there's no real fine
details<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.500> there<00:01:04.710> but<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.460> on<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.330> faces<00:01:07.140> the

details on there but on on the faces the
the<00:01:09.000> places<00:01:09.420> where<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:09.840> plaster<00:01:10.409> will<00:01:10.560> stick

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
the places where the plaster will stick

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.820 
the places where the plaster will stick
up<00:01:11.159> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.670> inside<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:12.210> mold<00:01:12.420> relief<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:13.770> a

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
up on the inside of the mold relief in a

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.490 
up on the inside of the mold relief in a
really<00:01:14.100> fine<00:01:14.659> detail<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:15.990> mouth<00:01:16.200> and

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
really fine detail like the mouth and

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.649 
really fine detail like the mouth and
around<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.799> eyes<00:01:16.950> I'm<00:01:17.909> actually<00:01:18.180> losing

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
around the eyes I'm actually losing

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.080 
around the eyes I'm actually losing
those<00:01:19.110> pieces<00:01:19.590> when<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.799> pull<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.430> casting<00:01:20.939> out

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
those pieces when I pull the casting out

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.730 
those pieces when I pull the casting out
of<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.240> mold<00:01:21.479> so<00:01:21.720> I'm<00:01:21.900> only<00:01:22.049> getting<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.560> use

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
of the mold so I'm only getting to use

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.249 
of the mold so I'm only getting to use
them<00:01:22.979> once<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.549> think<00:01:23.820> probably<00:01:24.180> using<00:01:24.750> casting

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
them once I think probably using casting

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.289 
them once I think probably using casting
plaster<00:01:25.560> rather<00:01:26.100> than<00:01:26.369> plaster<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.880> Paris

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
plaster rather than plaster of Paris

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.460 
plaster rather than plaster of Paris
might<00:01:27.540> help<00:01:27.979> but<00:01:29.540> we<00:01:30.540> don't<00:01:30.869> have<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.079> pottery

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
might help but we don't have a pottery

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.160 
might help but we don't have a pottery
