00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:10.790
 New Weapons Come on-It's too sudden The weapon we will use this time is a bold marker 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:15.200
 A weapon added the other day, so it's a blaze shooter for super proximity . 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:15.860
 There is a great deal of volume only on the day it was released, so I want to use all the new weapons 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.220
 Will 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.900
 Please take a look at this blaze but it's really out of range 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:26.880
 It is a shooter with quite different pros and cons- The range is 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.810
 Longer than or blatter and shorter than Wakaba shooter, but instead it is an enemy with 3 confirmed shots 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.590
 I can beat it 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.770
 By What I do not have the fire power if the coating is also a problem until there 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:39.420
 I have set up the sub marker beacon of bold marker 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.890
 Paint the surroundings in the off-room before the enemies that you can always get here 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.660
 And it is this to install beacon 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.770
 I think it will be the main way to fight weapons, but the paint performance is so bad there 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.140
 It doesn't mean that 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:55.239
 Because it is a temporary marker system , there is also a high diffusion rate in the young leaf shooter needle 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:01:00.100
 Is it hard to do the alternative ? 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:01.880
 Well, so this weapon does not need to worry so much if it is brought close to the super short distance 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.500
 Play to see if you get close 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:08.600
 Well, it's gradually becoming more and more people are using weapons for long distance nowadays 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.670
 Isn't it white? 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:17.060
 Another weapon came out at the same time as the release of this weapon, 96 was a child in theory 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.330
 It is a set of shield and rhubarb squid from that range of Baron 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.580
 I think yeah you use everyone Do's rumor I pretty strong 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.180
 Four 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.870
 I'm safe gallon than field marker I have become what and care 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:33.600
 It's already burnt, I 'm the way to declare war on ranged weapons 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:37.830
 By the way, the other party will see you like each other fight, if the lower was the dispatch Do because just like 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.600
 I 'm crazy about you I'm a normal fighting enthusiast 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.830
 I can only see this fight-Now the team is in a pinch 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.729
 It has become- I lost this bold marker, such as losing to a bold marker 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:49.960
 Not 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:55.119
 First of all, it's the beginning Ora Olora Where are you-probably will put 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:58.930
 Nara I also ridiculous is the opposite Let's oh so existing data in the back barrage shop 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.590
 It fights in Come short distance But you see how have you come 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.340
 Let's aim at a megaphone 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:08.030
 I found this if I did not hit 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:12.530
 I think that 3 is still good, so I will go further 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:16.180
 I was so lucky I 'm still here even if I knocked it down on the container anyway 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.480
 It's dangerous since the beacon is dangerous. 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:24.280
 I have a series of fires so I can climb if there are enemies 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:28.840
 Because high-power opponent also did a and allies how would be hard to hard to climb 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:33.489
 Really this bold marker is difficult to be active without linkage with allies 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.200
 Or you may have no choice but to specialize in assassination . 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:41.360
 I feel the operation method is still close to the blaster-shaped 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.970
 Shiroko It is almost time for us to take over the area, but I think it's already okay. 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.390
 At first we get the state of here 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:51.980
 Is it still there or is it that the enemy's beacon is still left 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.590
 Maybe the strength of I'll try it Old markers to say so, I feel that here always 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:56.190
 Set up a beacon on the other side and attack your opponent from behind 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.520
 It's easy to fight with numbers 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:03.960
 It will be, but it seems like we have finally got over it 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:09.300
 The remaining time is only a few minutes later, and if you keep the entrance, it will be pretty 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:10.140
 I feel likely to have planted the Sase enemy's come kana last attack saying char here and there painted the 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:16.070
 To do 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.070
 I came to and this is shooting jump and end 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:29.959
 It was a game that the fight in the north which would win if you painted this much was quite hot 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:35.420
 Let's look at the points that it was dangerous if you lost it there 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:37.780
 1204 or this time there was an ally's cover and it was easy to fight, so let's go to the next game 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:41.260
 Let's look 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:46.300
 In Let's continue to paint a plantation stick in bold marker 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:50.319
 It is your favorite stage There are many open places here, so be careful with short range weapons 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:55.569
 I have to fight while I have an opponent but I have a plastic shooter 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:57.800
 I can not win for sure if I fight against the face, let's fight with caution there 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:03.380
 First look at the map without crashing 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:04.310
 Well, there are many people who focus on the area in the future, so avoid putting in a pot with that person 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.960
 Where I want 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:12.190
 It seems that the opponent who has entered is also a dynamo roller. 

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:16.750
 Do you have and there were still enemy's uniform 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.410
 Diffusion rate of the pole Domaka the better of Tana spline shooter become adversaries collecting elastic is a good 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.790
 I from 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:26.560
 I can not run away from that unless I'm in close range, but even then the number of plastic shooters has increased 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:28.120
 I think it's a pretty good weapon, but it 's a Butt special that 's especially easy to win in a match 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.180
 I think it's performance 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:36.289
 However, since the coating performance is not high, points will be caught in the territory 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:41.150
 We did not intend to get off , but because we got a foot, let's paint 

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:42.350
 If you look at the package is not good, think of being on the other side and think of the megaphone laser 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:47.960
 You Once you hit 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:52.169
 Because the megaphone penetrates in a straight line, it can be used quite well to restrict the movement of the opponent 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:56.550
 The position here was out, that dynamo roller may be quite troublesome 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:05:00.029
 Such you sprinkle the ink or Naa from the top of the body from a little while ago Hey Dyna another somehow 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:04.529
 It will be difficult to attack if you don't defeat it and it's a sensor 

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:07.560
 This is not a threat as it has marking guards on the contrary. 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:12.190
 In the guise and there we will try to attack the opposition 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:17.710
 Ally at once if further bomb rush Is this the tornado Semekomu system 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.440
 You can win if you are not seen at close range Here I can reduce the enemy at once and progress on allies 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:24.300
 If not 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:29.850
 It is or is after we defeated two people where you are the enemy, but we accumulate special gauge 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:33.420
 If so, one of the 7th rudder alone is now in the center with his friend and 3 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:38.130
 He did the rest, but I have to push nice 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:39.430
 This sense of communication is a good part of Splatoon , let's go on the offensive at once 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:42.940
 Center ahead of anything 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:46.360
 I'm going to paint, because I'm putting a speed below 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:50.920
 I'm behind is immediately is the front return Oh enemy 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:56.050
 Let's go to the place where the durability of the shield is slightly scraped off and not wet 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:59.160
 After all, I have to fight with the enemy soon after it's getting pretty rough, but now 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.160
 There is little room 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:09.060
 O and Te' hiding in the shield if I There are spline shooter beyond 

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:14.190
 Unfortunately special to know it is by city and Bale is to say Do not I have to be careful 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:17.540
 It may have been a resurgence of the present, but because it is the only weapon to thrust it with that weapon 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:20.870
 Then let's strike a megaphone so that it does not come from here 

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:23.960
 After Do It seems the enemy has been done is it the opposite direction 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:29.330
 I do not miss you say that the rhubarb squid smashed 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:31.790
 How to we heard Poi be seen from the coating range of the ink Do I Tekigai likely on the other side 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:35.500
 Try doing hiding on whether the wall can not be surprise 

00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:40.360
 Oh oh oh old marker is what 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:42.700
 The enemy which was impossible in the end is gathered in a row and this is pretty bad 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.540
 I don't know, but I won't have 10 seconds 

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:53.820
 Anyway, I will jump to the original allies are in place, such is likely to stay the enemy 

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:53.820
 After that, I just paint it on and on. I'm finished by saying that there are more ranges . 

00:06:54.249 --> 00:07:03.069
 It's unexpectedly half wet, so the rest of the time I was beaten is too little and the other gets wet too 

00:06:59.619 --> 00:07:07.059
 You won't win by a very slight difference 

00:07:03.069 --> 00:07:12.099
 There was a weapon that was quite incompatible with the opponent, but somehow managed to 

00:07:07.059 --> 00:07:14.270
 This time it was to show a scene that could be active in bold marker compatibility of this shook quite ally 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:17.720
 It is a weapon where cooperation is important 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:22.430
 So it may be recommended for those who want to practice the assault 

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:25.750
 We need to be careful so that it is not done by forcibly thrust your far this time by saying that the Do 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:25.750
 Thank you for watching
