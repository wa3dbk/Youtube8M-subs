00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.030
 Hello 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.580
 Today's video is a good bracelet. 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.189
 quick and easy to do in which I 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.029
 I used only folds in 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.600
 fabric 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.220
 So let's start to do this. 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.310
 bracelet and I'm wearing fabric 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:32.489
 already has video on the channel showing 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.640
 how I do I'm using two types 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:39.090
 of two fabric prints are seven 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.570
 rectangles of each and the measure is 7 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.960
 and a half by 5, and the fold is fine. 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:53.160
 Simple then with the back side up I 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:01:00.870
 double in half and then I'll take this 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:05.989
 side for this side and there I go 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.989
 here double where they form the triangle 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:15.689
 I 'll mark it well soon, I 'll turn and make the 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:21.240
 same thing here then this side goes 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:26.100
 come to this side and I'll also fold 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:29.189
 here where a triangle formed and became 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:34.320
 so in a small box and I go 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:37.409
 to do this is in the two fabric prints 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:41.369
 they stayed like this and it 's very simple I 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.770
 I said I chose is the white part is the 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.290
 white fabric as the bottom fabric 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.009
 so I'm going to override this stampa 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.100
 Dinho de preto stayed like this, I'm going to double 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.930
 this white was white above the 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.259
 black print and this other flap 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:05.969
 on top of the white as if it were a 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.910
 and white on top and this is 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:12.060
 part that was left here that is left here 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.590
 Look, there's a pocket that's formed. 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.410
 this is where I have 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:24.060
 anyone who finds this tip as the fabric is 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:28.280
 on a lawn and a rectangle is not much 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:32.160
 great is it gets a little sturdy 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:34.379
 but it's not difficult, it's easy 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.989
 and there was so then here we 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:40.459
 need to pass a little glue can 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:44.010
 be with the white can be glued cloth 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:48.390
 but it's very little even where people 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.860
 just fit inside the pocket is 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.959
 here we are going to spend a little bit 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.980
 tail 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:03:00.030
 I'm using white glue and I'm happy. 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:05.250
 What happens here is formal or 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:08.910
 another pocket and there I'm wearing it 's a 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.459
 elastic rubber two centimeters 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:14.160
 black width in my case 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.739
 so I'm going to make seven equal parts for 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.709
 this I need 14 rectangles and it's 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.109
 only you put the elastic 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:28.099
 inside that pocket that 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:30.660
 He graduated and he will be like this 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:34.530
 here are already seven here I just 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:39.000
 garnish with it's adhesive pearls 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.819
 I even took one card that she 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:46.049
 Alone she will not hold on long. 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.760
 here only with adhesive on the cloth 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.720
 so you need a little glue 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.359
 cloth 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:52.650
 here I think the cloth is better than the 

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:57.180
 White glue 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:04:03.299
 but it's just a little droplet and it puts the 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:06.209
 line holds a little and there it is 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.280
 just close like we close where 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:12.480
 You put here that you passed 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:15.450
 has the pocket here and the part is 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.570
 from the front let's call it that way I will 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:21.180
 glue the elastic in this part of the 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.919
 front leaving this part free for 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.270
 to be able to close 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:29.820
 so here I am going to wear fano collar too 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:36.480
 then at the top 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:39.210
 there does not need to be too much glue there is not you 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.550
 will wait for drying can help 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.430
 with a small piece of crepe tape 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:48.030
 let's cut this elastic surplus 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.100
 here and join the other party 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:53.030
 How am I going to cut here? 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.970
 a little is fulfilled 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:59.580
 passing through this part up here 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.780
 You said elastic this part here looks 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.600
 was free 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.600
 So you're going to fit the rubber band here. 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:13.140
 there are certain cute little ones and also glue 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:18.570
 cloth 

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:21.330
 only at this junction did he put the cloth glue 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:24.240
 yes there is our 6 tape crepe 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.270
 to not have to hold the time 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:32.400
 to dry, just take the crepe tape and then 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:35.850
 she will stay is just like that 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.560
 this or that one I'm using 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.240
 The only difference is that in this one I 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.960
 I faced more with hope lines 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.960
 adhesive 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:51.300
 I hope you liked it, I do not know 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:53.750
 forget to give a jewel and sign the 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:57.830
 channel to receive updates 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:57.830
 kisses and until the next
