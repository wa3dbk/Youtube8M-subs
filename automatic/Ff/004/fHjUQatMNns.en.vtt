00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 
remove the shock you have to undo the

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.800 
remove the shock you have to undo the
linkage<00:02:10.869> and<00:02:11.760> then<00:02:12.760> drop<00:02:12.970> the<00:02:13.120> shock<00:02:13.330> way<00:02:13.750> down

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
linkage and then drop the shock way down

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:25.350 
linkage and then drop the shock way down
so<00:02:16.810> and<00:02:17.200> one<00:02:17.350> of<00:02:17.410> the<00:02:17.500> tricks<00:02:17.739> there<00:02:18.010> is<00:02:23.190> so<00:02:24.360> you

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
so and one of the tricks there is so you

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.910 
so and one of the tricks there is so you
don't<00:02:25.420> have<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.720> deny<00:02:25.840> everything<00:02:26.380> if<00:02:26.860> you

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
don't have to deny everything if you

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.320 
don't have to deny everything if you
lived<00:02:27.220> on<00:02:27.310> this<00:02:27.400> because<00:02:27.550> I'm<00:02:27.760> starting<00:02:28.300> I

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
lived on this because I'm starting I

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.259 
lived on this because I'm starting I
think<00:02:28.540> is<00:02:28.810> my<00:02:29.050> buddy<00:02:29.290> but<00:02:30.220> you<00:02:30.549> only<00:02:30.700> have<00:02:30.970> to

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
think is my buddy but you only have to

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:38.610 
think is my buddy but you only have to
remove<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:34.780> rear<00:02:37.170> so<00:02:38.170> you<00:02:38.260> only<00:02:38.380> have<00:02:38.500> to

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
remove the rear so you only have to

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:41.759 
remove the rear so you only have to
remove<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.190> bolt<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.730> fits<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:40.120> here<00:02:40.390> and<00:02:40.780> then

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:41.769 
remove the bolt it fits to here and then

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.990 
remove the bolt it fits to here and then
let's<00:02:42.040> just<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.910> thing<00:02:43.150> you<00:02:43.269> swing<00:02:43.690> down<00:02:43.720> and

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
let's just this thing you swing down and

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.270 
let's just this thing you swing down and
then<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.510> also<00:02:46.690> have<00:02:46.930> to<00:02:47.049> remove<00:02:47.320> the<00:02:47.860> bolt<00:02:48.100> in

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
then you also have to remove the bolt in

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.039 
then you also have to remove the bolt in
the<00:02:48.370> bottom<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.700> the<00:02:48.760> shop<00:02:49.030> so<00:02:49.720> once<00:02:49.900> you've

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
the bottom of the shop so once you've

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.590 
the bottom of the shop so once you've
done<00:02:50.260> that<00:02:50.910> they<00:02:51.910> explained<00:02:52.269> this<00:02:52.390> in<00:02:52.540> the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
done that they explained this in the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.920 
done that they explained this in the
book<00:02:52.810> but<00:02:53.079> it's<00:02:53.260> easy<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.650> overlook<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:55.030> raise

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
book but it's easy to overlook is raise

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:02.330 
book but it's easy to overlook is raise
the<00:02:55.959> rear<00:02:56.440> wheel<00:02:56.650> up

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.520 

so<00:03:03.340> raise<00:03:03.609> the<00:03:03.820> rear<00:03:03.970> wheel<00:03:04.180> that<00:03:04.480> is<00:03:04.540> like<00:03:05.320> the

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
so raise the rear wheel that is like the

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.470 
so raise the rear wheel that is like the
trick<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:05.950> getting<00:03:06.160> that<00:03:06.400> shock<00:03:07.150> into

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
trick to getting that shock into

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.690 
trick to getting that shock into
position<00:03:07.930> and

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
position and

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.100 
position and
wipe<00:03:08.849> out<00:03:09.090> you<00:03:09.660> don't<00:03:09.810> do<00:03:10.020> that<00:03:11.930> you'll<00:03:12.930> be

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
wipe out you don't do that you'll be

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.720 
wipe out you don't do that you'll be
fighting<00:03:13.470> it<00:03:13.560> and<00:03:13.830> you'll<00:03:13.980> scratch<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.489> shot

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
fighting it and you'll scratch the shot

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.770 
fighting it and you'll scratch the shot
cut<00:03:14.940> off<00:03:15.060> and<00:03:15.890> just<00:03:16.890> trying<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.220> no<00:03:17.400> mess<00:03:17.780> so

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
cut off and just trying to no mess so

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.490 
cut off and just trying to no mess so
once<00:03:19.140> you've<00:03:19.319> got<00:03:19.590> that<00:03:21.050> know<00:03:22.050> if<00:03:22.110> I<00:03:22.230> can<00:03:22.379> do

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
once you've got that know if I can do

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.100 
once you've got that know if I can do
this<00:03:22.650> one-handed<00:03:23.040> today<00:03:26.599> and<00:03:27.599> you<00:03:27.690> know<00:03:27.810> once

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
this one-handed today and you know once

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.290 
this one-handed today and you know once
you've<00:03:28.319> got<00:03:28.530> all<00:03:28.709> those<00:03:28.920> pieces<00:03:29.280> out<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:32.300> can

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
you've got all those pieces out you can

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.020 
you've got all those pieces out you can
lower<00:03:33.510> the<00:03:33.599> shock<00:03:34.010> down<00:03:35.010> to<00:03:35.190> work<00:03:35.370> sticks<00:03:35.790> way

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
lower the shock down to work sticks way

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.410 
lower the shock down to work sticks way
off<00:03:36.569> the<00:03:36.720> bottom<00:03:37.019> way<00:03:37.170> down<00:03:37.380> here<00:03:38.239> then<00:03:39.239> you

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
off the bottom way down here then you

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.550 
off the bottom way down here then you
can<00:03:39.569> remove<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:39.989> head<00:03:40.140> pipe<00:03:42.349> after<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.440> head

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
can remove the head pipe after the head

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.199 
can remove the head pipe after the head
pipes<00:03:43.799> after<00:03:44.190> the<00:03:44.280> shot<00:03:44.489> comes<00:03:44.700> up<00:03:44.849> it<00:03:44.970> easily

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
pipes after the shot comes up it easily

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.330 
pipes after the shot comes up it easily
comes<00:03:45.450> out<00:03:45.630> through<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:46.099> triangulated<00:03:47.099> area

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
comes out through this triangulated area

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.949 
comes out through this triangulated area
to<00:03:47.400> hear<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.760> shock<00:03:48.000> just<00:03:48.180> pulls<00:03:48.510> out<00:03:48.660> through

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
to hear the shock just pulls out through

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.630 
to hear the shock just pulls out through
here<00:03:49.849> so<00:03:51.620> that's<00:03:52.620> really<00:03:52.799> about<00:03:52.920> all<00:03:53.069> this

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
here so that's really about all this

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.059 
here so that's really about all this
this<00:03:54.599> is<00:03:54.780> all<00:03:55.019> in<00:03:55.230> the<00:03:55.349> owner's<00:03:55.590> manual

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:56.069 
this is all in the owner's manual

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.699 
this is all in the owner's manual
I<00:03:56.220> think<00:03:56.849> it's<00:03:57.000> back<00:03:57.239> on<00:03:57.530> page<00:03:58.970> 51<00:04:00.349> through<00:04:01.349> 55

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:01.709 
I think it's back on page 51 through 55

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.660 
I think it's back on page 51 through 55
somewhere<00:04:02.310> in<00:04:02.370> that<00:04:02.430> range<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:04.010> I<00:04:05.010> would<00:04:05.400> look

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:05.670 
somewhere in that range and I would look

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:08.180 
somewhere in that range and I would look
at<00:04:05.819> that<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:05.970> couple<00:04:06.209> of<00:04:06.299> times<00:04:06.890> it<00:04:07.890> tells<00:04:08.099> you

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
at that a couple of times it tells you

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:09.319 
at that a couple of times it tells you
how<00:04:08.280> to<00:04:08.310> take<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.549> out<00:04:08.760> and<00:04:08.940> how<00:04:09.060> to<00:04:09.090> put<00:04:09.299> it

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
how to take it out and how to put it

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.130 
how to take it out and how to put it
back<00:04:09.510> in

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
back in

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.390 
back in
same<00:04:11.040> for<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.280> head<00:04:11.430> pipe<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:12.000> so<00:04:12.959> just<00:04:13.400> read

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400 
same for the head pipe and so just read

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
same for the head pipe and so just read
the<00:04:14.489> manual<00:04:14.989> it's<00:04:15.989> all<00:04:16.139> for<00:04:16.320> now
