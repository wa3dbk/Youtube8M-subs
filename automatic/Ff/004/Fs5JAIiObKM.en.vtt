all right this is the intro to just my
imagination<00:00:04.589> by<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:05.339> temptations<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:07.140> just

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:07.620 
imagination by the temptations I just

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.410 
imagination by the temptations I just
learned<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:08.040> less<00:00:08.340> than<00:00:08.550> five<00:00:08.790> minutes<00:00:08.970> ago

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
learned this less than five minutes ago

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.110 
learned this less than five minutes ago
so<00:00:09.690> pardon<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:11.090> mistakes<00:00:12.090> but<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.610> it<00:00:14.610> starts

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
so pardon the mistakes but the it starts

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.950 
so pardon the mistakes but the it starts
on<00:00:15.269> a<00:00:15.630> bend<00:00:16.350> on<00:00:16.740> D<00:00:17.670> just<00:00:18.300> fifth<00:00:18.539> fret<00:00:18.750> on<00:00:18.810> the

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
on a bend on D just fifth fret on the

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.580 
on a bend on D just fifth fret on the
a-string<00:00:21.680> and<00:00:22.789> that<00:00:23.789> ends<00:00:24.060> on<00:00:24.180> C<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:24.930> it's<00:00:25.170> d

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
a-string and that ends on C so it's d

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.500 
a-string and that ends on C so it's d
bend<00:00:26.189> C<00:00:27.410> third<00:00:28.410> fret<00:00:28.619> na

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.690 

and<00:00:31.720> I<00:00:31.750> just<00:00:32.470> look<00:00:32.619> up<00:00:32.710> a<00:00:32.829> chord<00:00:33.070> chart<00:00:33.370> or<00:00:33.640> a

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
and I just look up a chord chart or a

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.340 
and I just look up a chord chart or a
fretboard<00:00:34.480> chart<00:00:34.750> if<00:00:34.840> you<00:00:34.930> can't<00:00:35.110> get<00:00:35.230> the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:35.350 
fretboard chart if you can't get the

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.140 
fretboard chart if you can't get the
notes<00:00:35.530> because<00:00:35.739> it's<00:00:35.890> way<00:00:36.700> easier<00:00:37.090> to

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
notes because it's way easier to

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.440 
notes because it's way easier to
describe<00:00:37.630> it<00:00:37.809> by<00:00:37.930> note<00:00:38.200> names<00:00:38.500> than<00:00:38.770> by<00:00:39.450> fret

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:40.450 
describe it by note names than by fret

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.119 
describe it by note names than by fret
numbers<00:00:40.809> it<00:00:40.960> gets<00:00:41.110> too<00:00:41.230> confusing<00:00:43.980> so<00:00:44.980> the

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
numbers it gets too confusing so the

00:00:45.129 --> 00:01:04.200 
numbers it gets too confusing so the
notes<00:00:45.400> are<00:00:45.699> deep<00:00:46.360> and<00:00:48.360> c-d-c<00:00:49.390> a<00:00:50.010> c<00:00:59.610> d<00:01:00.750> c--<00:01:02.520> d<00:01:03.520> c--

comes<00:01:25.660> the<00:01:25.750> tricky<00:01:25.960> bit<00:01:26.380> which<00:01:27.280> is<00:01:27.550> I'm

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
comes the tricky bit which is I'm

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.859 
comes the tricky bit which is I'm
barring<00:01:30.840> C<00:01:31.840> and<00:01:32.110> F<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:34.000> third<00:01:34.030> fret<00:01:34.600> right

barring C and F the third fret right

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.480 
barring C and F the third fret right
here<00:01:35.140> with<00:01:35.500> my<00:01:35.740> first<00:01:36.039> finger<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.619> playing

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490

here with my first finger and playing
both<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:39.910> those<00:01:40.209> notes<00:01:40.630> and<00:01:40.929> the<00:01:41.860> a<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.069> D

strings

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:55.660 

so<00:01:54.230> what<00:01:54.380> I'm<00:01:54.470> doing<00:01:54.710> is<00:01:54.800> I'm<00:01:54.920> barring<00:01:55.310> both<00:01:55.490> of
