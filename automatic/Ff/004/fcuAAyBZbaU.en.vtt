00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.160
 and I'm going to show you the preparation of the 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:18.720
 pool for summer and its 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.720
 maintenance during the rest of the year 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.960
 for the maintenance of our pool 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:31.309
 we will need as clean tools 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:34.059
 leaf picker and dispenser backgrounds 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.059
 floating 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.790
 ph reducer 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:48.780
 rapid chlorine pH elevator 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:52.140
 Chlorine 4 effects on tablets 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:56.969
 winter cleaner liquid filter cleaner 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:59.420
 to the flocculant suicide and a kit 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.420
 analysis 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:09.010
 so that the water in the pool is 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.660
 clean and the ph level is correct no 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.420
 it is enough with the system of 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:15.130
 debugging you need to add ones 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.360
 chemicals at the beginning of the 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.880
 season 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.820
 first of all we will regulate the level of 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.630
 ph for it we will use the analyzer 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:28.869
 of ph the optimal level should be between 7 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:32.470
 with 2 and 7 with 6 if it is above 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:34.509
 we will use a ph reducer if it is 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.240
 underneath we will add to the water a 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.950
 ph elevator these products are 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.080
 will add to the water following the 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.780
 manufacturer's instructions as 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.020
 we will calculate the meters of the pool if 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.830
 our pool is oval will be the long 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:53.700
 by the width by 0.89 by the depth 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.130
 half if our pool is rectangular 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.920
 the volume will be the length by the width 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.970
 by the average depth if the pool 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:08.410
 round the volume will be the diameter by 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.610
 the diameter by 0 785 depth 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.580
 half 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.520
 the next step is to disinfect the water 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.750
 for this we will add quick chlorine 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.510
 we will eliminate microorganisms 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.189
 such as fungi bacteria and germs 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.060
 we dose it according to the 

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:25.060
 manufacturer's instructions 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.590
 and after a few hours we will analyze 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.250
 again the water with a ph analyzer and 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.100
 free chlorine 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:39.520
 the chlorine level must be between 0 5 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:41.920
 milligrams liter and 15 milligrams liter 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.290
 to prevent the appearance of algae in 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.590
 the pool that we will be dyed green 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.900
 the water and we will get the glass of the 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.540
 very slippery pool is convenient 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.460
 use a algid so that the 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.290
 effective protection is convenient 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.680
 additional in the lxi appointment all the 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.680
 weeks 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.049
 applying the dose recommended by the 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:07.019
 manufacturer last we will add a 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:09.599
 Its function is to agglutinate and 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.069
 precipitate to the bottom of the pool 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:13.110
 small particles that cloud the 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.079
 water and that the filters are unable to 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.640
 retain in this way we can 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.640
 remove with the clean background 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.170
 for the maintenance of the water of the 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.890
 pool during the season we will use 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.610
 4 effects chlorine 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.610
 O well 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.250
 clear multifunction 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.270
 These products can be purchased at 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.640
 pills 200 grams easier 

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:46.010
 apply we will introduce the pills in 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.710
 the skimmer or in a floating dispenser 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.990
 for its correct dissolution the quantity 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:53.900
 will be indicated by the manufacturer according to 

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:56.290
 the volume of the pool an alternative 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.440
 ecological to chlorine is the active oxygen 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:02.959
 It is colorless odorless and does not irritate or 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:05.570
 skin or eyes to be less aggressive 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.400
 does not corrode materials and does not entail 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.590
 the risks of misuse of the 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.450
 chlorine for both people and 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.220
 the environment other tasks of 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.350
 maintenance that we will perform during 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.840
 the season are to control weekly 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.940
 the level of ph and chlorine clean the 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.190
 pool with clean funds at least 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:25.080
 once a week start up the 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:27.330
 purifier daily 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.650
 use the pick up leaves to remove 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.650
 insects and leaves 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.300
 at the end of the bathing season 

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:42.460
 we will leave the pool water ready 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:45.039
 so that the winter passes without losing its 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.349
 properties we will not empty it with results 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.449
 an economic and ecological base option 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.779
 we will clean the filters of the purifier 

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:54.279
 As well as the motor and we have water drain 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:56.409
 to it to prevent frost 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:58.599
 do not break them we will apply a product 

00:04:56.409 --> 00:05:01.270
 wintering according to the recommended dose 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:04.419
 the manufacturer and we will apply it again 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:06.430
 in the months of February and March it is convenient 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.219
 deposit in the water about drums 

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:11.289
 plastic to prevent the ice that is 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:13.599
 form on the surface will damage us 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.490
 Pool walls also suits 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:18.320
 put a protective canvas for 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.090
 keep the water cleaner 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:21.740
 and up to here our demonstration 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.810
 We invite you to visit our stores 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:27.250
