that it's discolored
that's<00:01:08.549> because<00:01:09.000> Windows<00:01:09.869> has<00:01:10.049> begun<00:01:10.409> to

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
that's because Windows has begun to

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
reason we like this software is because

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.429 
reason we like this software is because
after<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.500> choose<00:01:31.860> your<00:01:31.890> hard<00:01:32.340> drive<00:01:32.610> that

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
after you choose your hard drive that

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.499 
after you choose your hard drive that
the<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.130> wanted<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.490> find<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> deleted

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
the that you wanted to find the deleted

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.230 
the that you wanted to find the deleted
photos<00:01:36.979> it<00:01:37.979> organizes<00:01:38.610> everything<00:01:38.850> into

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
photos it organizes everything into

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.490 
photos it organizes everything into
folders<00:01:39.720> so<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.950> not<00:01:41.159> cryptic<00:01:42.350> you<00:01:43.350> can

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
folders so it's not cryptic you can

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.530 
folders so it's not cryptic you can
expand<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.340> then<00:01:44.490> notice<00:01:44.820> it<00:01:45.149> has

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
expand this and then notice it has

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.030 
expand this and then notice it has
broken<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.049> down<00:01:46.200> into<00:01:46.259> separate<00:01:46.829> folders

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
broken it down into separate folders

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.389 
broken it down into separate folders
basically<00:01:47.970> it<00:01:48.420> puts<00:01:48.750> 300<00:01:49.320> photos<00:01:49.740> in<00:01:49.979> each

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
basically it puts 300 photos in each

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.990 
basically it puts 300 photos in each
folder<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.570> then<00:01:52.290> what<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.619> would<00:01:52.740> do<00:01:52.979> is<00:01:53.369> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
folder and then what you would do is you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.490 
folder and then what you would do is you
click<00:01:54.180> on<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.509> folder<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:54.899> you'll<00:01:55.200> have<00:01:55.350> to

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
click on the folder and you'll have to

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.429 
click on the folder and you'll have to
