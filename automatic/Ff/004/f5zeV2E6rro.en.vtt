number one a retractable leash has a

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.490 
number one a retractable leash has a
constant<00:03:25.859> pressure<00:03:26.129> on<00:03:26.459> it<00:03:26.669> so<00:03:26.849> when<00:03:27.510> you<00:03:27.660> when

constantly under the pressure

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:35.420 
constantly under the pressure
meaning<00:03:33.840> if<00:03:34.199> you<00:03:34.319> put<00:03:34.530> that<00:03:34.650> leash<00:03:34.919> to<00:03:35.280> your
