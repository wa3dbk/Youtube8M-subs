Bank but I really didn't think they're

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.660 
Bank but I really didn't think they're
gonna<00:01:57.509> make<00:01:57.750> aliens<00:01:58.259> or<00:01:58.890> a<00:01:58.920> predator<00:01:59.430> and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
gonna make aliens or a predator and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.340 
gonna make aliens or a predator and
since<00:01:59.940> they're<00:02:00.090> both<00:02:00.210> produced<00:02:00.600> through<00:02:01.050> Fox
