00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.590
 and good to all how are you here 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:16.689
 I bring a tutorial on how to download 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.590
 minecraft minecraft upgradeable 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:24.130
 minecraft esp as a pirate for a 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:27.099
 computer a computer a pc pc 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:31.149
 super easy windows has brought problems 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:34.630
 that's why they have removed web pages for 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:38.020
 download it and all that and well then 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:41.739
 I found a good page you need the 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.410
 java and I would be the one left the link in the 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.010
 description link 7 uploaded in stockings and 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:50.550
 puntocom bar then whatever it is not what 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.679
 I'm going to do it because it would be too short 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.100
 So what are you going to do? 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:59.409
 download then download you 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.310
 would unload us a little eyelash 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:05.100
 with the chrome web that would be like a 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.030
 a document with a coffee sign inside 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.330
 so 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.210
 would not this go now to see the 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:15.240
 versions 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.100
 The good thing about this game is that it is 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.869
 upgradeable with all versions os 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.100
 I explain how it is then to see from 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.300
 choose the one that is for 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.030
 It is always better 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.370
 the last but maybe for a server 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.640
 like what john game you need the 1.2 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.100
 point 4.5 then to update it 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.040
 we just click on your plate and 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.200
 they were already then they come out they put the 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:46.560
 name they want this is mine 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.590
 well I have many many many and 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.200
 then what do they do put the name 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.940
 who want to change everything 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.530
 everything can be changed everything 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:59.220
 you need a password and you can 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:02.780
 then they would have this language 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:06.660
 normal single multiplayer then 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:09.660
 to play online we would need to love 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.200
 guys and it's not a connection server 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.210
 direct pirate like the one I am that 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.840
 that if he asks for my password, I'm not going to 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.480
 put and good but others need 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.000
 would you need the machi passed us the 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.710
