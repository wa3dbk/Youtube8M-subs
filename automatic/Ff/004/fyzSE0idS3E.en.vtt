00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
this is the code so i just showed guys a

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.410 
this is the code so i just showed guys a
script<00:03:14.420> if<00:03:14.630> you<00:03:14.870> guys<00:03:15.050> can<00:03:15.380> figure<00:03:15.709> out<00:03:16.420> are

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
script if you guys can figure out are

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.259 
script if you guys can figure out are
going<00:03:17.630> to<00:03:17.690> be<00:03:17.810> very<00:03:18.080> happy<00:03:18.700> just<00:03:19.700> give<00:03:19.970> me<00:03:20.000> the

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
going to be very happy just give me the

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
credit so this is the code this is just

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.970 
credit so this is the code this is just
the<00:03:25.190> visual<00:03:25.459> call<00:03:26.000> so<00:03:26.330> it<00:03:26.510> never<00:03:26.980> liked

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
the visual call so it never liked

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.430 
the visual call so it never liked
doesn't<00:03:28.640> appear<00:03:29.090> like<00:03:29.420> changing<00:03:30.019> just<00:03:30.290> to

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
doesn't appear like changing just to

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.420 
doesn't appear like changing just to
make<00:03:30.590> it<00:03:30.709> more<00:03:30.769> beautiful<00:03:31.340> and<00:03:32.470> this<00:03:33.470> is<00:03:33.830> the

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
make it more beautiful and this is the

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.809 
make it more beautiful and this is the
script<00:03:35.060> itself<00:03:35.299> if<00:03:36.230> you<00:03:37.220> guys<00:03:37.400> want<00:03:37.790> it<00:03:38.299> ask<00:03:38.540> me

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
script itself if you guys want it ask me

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.319
