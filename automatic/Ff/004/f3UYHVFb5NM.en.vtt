see<00:01:56.280> it<00:01:56.369> in<00:01:56.460> my<00:01:56.520> form<00:01:56.850> it's<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:58.170> little<00:01:58.770> funny

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100

because I'm getting another 12 reps out

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.620 
because I'm getting another 12 reps out
of<00:02:01.320> my<00:02:01.439> set<00:02:01.770> so<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.549> weight<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.820> clearly<00:02:03.299> fine

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
of my set so the weight is clearly fine

why<00:02:04.969> just<00:02:05.969> my<00:02:06.149> my<00:02:06.479> stamina<00:02:06.840> in<00:02:07.079> this<00:02:07.200> exercise

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
why just my my stamina in this exercise

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.719 
why just my my stamina in this exercise
seems<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.069> little<00:02:08.250> shaky

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
seems a little shaky

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.130

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
seems a little off and that's literally

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.410 
seems a little off and that's literally
just<00:02:10.289> because<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.920> have<00:02:11.519> not<00:02:11.760> done<00:02:11.970> dumbbell
