00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
one here is trays these are series of

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.390 
one here is trays these are series of
trays<00:00:26.770> I<00:00:27.689> think<00:00:28.689> should<00:00:28.779> be<00:00:28.840> unbanded<00:00:29.680> and

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
trays I think should be unbanded and

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.360 
trays I think should be unbanded and
easier<00:00:30.849> there<00:00:31.060> she<00:00:31.300> comes<00:00:31.509> out<00:00:32.160> it<00:00:33.160> could<00:00:33.280> be

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
easier there she comes out it could be

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.910 
easier there she comes out it could be
unbanded<00:00:34.180> and<00:00:34.390> you<00:00:34.900> can<00:00:35.050> do<00:00:35.140> your<00:00:35.320> harvesting

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
unbanded and you can do your harvesting

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.470 
unbanded and you can do your harvesting
back<00:00:36.730> in<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:38.829> if<00:00:38.920> you<00:00:39.040> note<00:00:39.340> on<00:00:39.700> the<00:00:39.820> bottom<00:00:40.060> us

back in but if you note on the bottom us

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.850 
back in but if you note on the bottom us
you<00:00:40.600> can<00:00:40.750> get<00:00:40.870> fairly<00:00:41.170> close<00:00:41.620> to<00:00:41.920> bottom<00:00:42.250> left

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:19.800 

one<00:01:16.810> of<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.020> first<00:01:17.850> units<00:01:18.850> I<00:01:19.000> ever<00:01:19.149> made<00:01:19.450> is

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
one of the first units I ever made is

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.069 
one of the first units I ever made is
directly<00:01:20.170> above<00:01:20.350> it<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:21.040> you<00:01:21.189> see<00:01:21.399> a<00:01:21.430> little

00:01:22.069 --> 00:01:22.079

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.270 
directly above it and you see a little
guy<00:01:23.079> here<00:01:23.350> trying<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.680> come<00:01:23.829> out<00:01:23.860> with<00:01:24.159> to<00:01:24.250> a
