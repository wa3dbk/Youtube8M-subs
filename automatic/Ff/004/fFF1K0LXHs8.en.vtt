armor while not over exposing your side
hull<00:00:38.399> armor<00:00:38.700> there<00:00:39.570> is<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:39.930> interesting<00:00:40.370> flaw

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
hull armor there is one interesting flaw

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.619 
hull armor there is one interesting flaw
and<00:00:41.670> the<00:00:41.790> armor<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.090> this<00:00:42.210> tank<00:00:42.450> actually

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
and the armor of this tank actually

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.180 
and the armor of this tank actually
didn't<00:00:42.960> realize<00:00:43.260> this<00:00:43.440> until<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.829> looked<00:00:44.070> at

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
didn't realize this until I looked at

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.400 
didn't realize this until I looked at
this<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> tanks<00:00:44.940> GG<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.629> tank<00:00:45.960> inspector

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
this in the tanks GG and tank inspector

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.740 
this in the tanks GG and tank inspector
but<00:00:46.620> this<00:00:47.070> neck<00:00:47.370> area<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.820> under<00:00:48.180> 80

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
but this neck area is under 80

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.110 
but this neck area is under 80
millimeters<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.620> armor<00:00:49.980> but<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.789> don't<00:00:51.030> think

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
millimeters of armor but I don't think

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.400 
millimeters of armor but I don't think
most<00:00:51.329> people<00:00:51.600> know<00:00:51.629> that<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.989> guys<00:00:52.079> can<00:00:52.289> let

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
jamb tanks like this tier 8 medium is

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.640 
jamb tanks like this tier 8 medium is
trying<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.570> finish<00:01:03.809> me<00:01:04.049> off<00:01:04.080> since<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.470> only

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
trying to finish me off since I only

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.469 
trying to finish me off since I only
have<00:01:04.830> 80<00:01:05.129> hit<00:01:05.339> points<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:05.850> come<00:01:06.150> up<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.390> I

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
have 80 hit points so I come up and I

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.660 
have 80 hit points so I come up and I
jammed<00:01:06.840> him<00:01:07.080> initially<00:01:07.830> when<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.220> approach<00:01:08.490> him

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
jammed him initially when I approach him

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.240 
jammed him initially when I approach him
my<00:01:08.850> hull<00:01:09.210> is<00:01:09.360> angled<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.380> still<00:01:10.650> angled<00:01:11.070> and

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
my hull is angled it's still angled and

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.460 
my hull is angled it's still angled and
then<00:01:11.820> you<00:01:12.030> know<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> finished<00:01:12.479> him<00:01:12.540> off<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
then you know I finished him off the

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.870 
then you know I finished him off the
really<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.860> only<00:01:13.979> weakness<00:01:14.250> of<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.670> tank

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
really the only weakness of this tank

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.399 
really the only weakness of this tank
has<00:01:15.060> is<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.630> silver<00:01:15.990> or<00:01:16.110> ammo

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
has is that the silver or ammo

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.249 
has is that the silver or ammo
penetration<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.189> pretty<00:01:17.400> lackluster<00:01:17.670> at<00:01:18.259> 198

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
penetration is pretty lackluster at 198

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.380 
penetration is pretty lackluster at 198
and<00:01:19.470> notice<00:01:20.009> as<00:01:20.159> this<00:01:20.310> chrono<00:01:20.580> comes<00:01:20.970> up<00:01:21.210> I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
and notice as this chrono comes up I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.270 
and notice as this chrono comes up I
track<00:01:21.689> him<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:21.990> then<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.170> approach<00:01:22.950> him<00:01:23.100> at<00:01:23.250> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
track him and then I approach him at a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.390 
track him and then I approach him at a
30-degree<00:01:23.610> angle<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:24.780> keep<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.320> front<00:01:26.220> hull

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
30-degree angle to keep that front hull

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.399 
30-degree angle to keep that front hull
armor<00:01:26.689> significantly<00:01:27.689> angled<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.259> much

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
armor significantly angled and much

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.380 
armor significantly angled and much
therefore<00:01:28.770> stronger<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.670> he's<00:01:30.090> actually

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
therefore stronger and he's actually

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.569 
therefore stronger and he's actually
firing<00:01:30.650> APCR<00:01:31.650> which<00:01:31.799> he'll<00:01:31.950> say<00:01:32.130> in<00:01:32.220> chat<00:01:32.400> here

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
firing APCR which he'll say in chat here

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.819 
firing APCR which he'll say in chat here
in<00:01:32.670> a<00:01:32.729> minute<00:01:33.030> but<00:01:33.659> I<00:01:33.689> totally<00:01:34.170> jammed<00:01:34.619> him

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
in a minute but I totally jammed him

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.819 
in a minute but I totally jammed him
came<00:01:35.100> up<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.460> finished<00:01:35.729> him<00:01:35.880> off<00:01:36.740> like<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.799> was

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
came up and finished him off like I was

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.080 
came up and finished him off like I was

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.210 
saying you know the silver penetration
is<00:01:39.240> relatively<00:01:39.750> low<00:01:39.960> at<00:01:40.049> 198<00:01:40.500> but<00:01:40.920> if<00:01:41.070> you're

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
is relatively low at 198 but if you're

penetration<00:01:48.149> value<00:01:48.390> of<00:01:48.509> 245<00:01:48.960> and<00:01:49.470> APCR<00:01:50.040> is<00:01:50.460> you

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
penetration value of 245 and APCR is you

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.819 
penetration value of 245 and APCR is you
know<00:01:51.479> much<00:01:51.659> preferable<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.229> heat<00:01:52.500> since<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
know much preferable to heat since you

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.319 
know much preferable to heat since you
don't<00:01:53.009> end<00:01:53.220> up<00:01:53.340> having<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.880> deal<00:01:54.000> with<00:01:54.030> spaced

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.359 
don't end up having to deal with spaced
armor<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:55.320> we're<00:01:55.409> gonna<00:01:55.500> look<00:01:55.619> at<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.770> replay<00:01:55.920> of

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
armor so we're gonna look at a replay of

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.819 
armor so we're gonna look at a replay of
a<00:01:56.909> tier<00:01:57.180> 8<00:01:57.210> alpha<00:01:57.659> Luke<00:01:57.960> battle<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.590> great

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
a tier 8 alpha Luke battle so it's great

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.530 
a tier 8 alpha Luke battle so it's great
for<00:01:59.009> me<00:01:59.189> that<00:01:59.399> I'm<00:01:59.490> top<00:01:59.729> tier<00:02:00.000> but<00:02:00.180> if<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.329> look

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
for me that I'm top tier but if you look

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.969 
for me that I'm top tier but if you look
at<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.719> relative<00:02:00.869> team<00:02:01.320> compositions

152 actually stops behind a bush which
is<00:02:24.560> like<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.830> mile<00:02:25.160> back<00:02:25.490> from<00:02:26.030> kind<00:02:26.720> of<00:02:26.810> any

tracked<00:03:15.140> but<00:03:15.410> I<00:03:15.440> don't<00:03:15.860> panic<00:03:16.430> and<00:03:16.580> I<00:03:16.610> don't

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
tracked but I don't panic and I don't

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.540 
tracked but I don't panic and I don't
burn<00:03:17.030> my<00:03:17.180> repair<00:03:17.510> kit<00:03:17.750> because<00:03:18.530> I<00:03:18.800> know<00:03:19.220> that

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
burn my repair kit because I know that

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.190 
burn my repair kit because I know that
I'm<00:03:19.670> not<00:03:19.880> in<00:03:20.090> any<00:03:20.239> kind<00:03:20.450> of<00:03:20.600> position<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:20.959> take

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
I'm not in any kind of position to take

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.470 
I'm not in any kind of position to take
meaningful<00:03:21.380> damage<00:03:22.010> so<00:03:22.280> if<00:03:22.910> we<00:03:23.060> look<00:03:23.239> at<00:03:23.330> this

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
meaningful damage so if we look at this

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.960 
meaningful damage so if we look at this
from<00:03:23.750> their<00:03:24.380> perspective<00:03:25.040> what<00:03:25.640> you'll<00:03:25.790> see

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
from their perspective what you'll see

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.090 
from their perspective what you'll see
since<00:03:26.180> my<00:03:26.330> tank<00:03:26.600> was<00:03:26.780> leaning<00:03:27.140> back<00:03:27.170> when<00:03:28.070> I

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
since my tank was leaning back when I

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.009 
since my tank was leaning back when I
was<00:03:28.280> tracked<00:03:28.610> the<00:03:29.060> upper<00:03:29.269> front<00:03:29.450> laces<00:03:29.840> is

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
was tracked the upper front laces is

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:32.199 
was tracked the upper front laces is
super<00:03:30.650> angled<00:03:31.070> so<00:03:31.220> that's<00:03:31.400> pretty<00:03:31.760> much<00:03:31.850> Auto

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
super angled so that's pretty much Auto

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.210 
super angled so that's pretty much Auto
Bounce<00:03:32.480> territory<00:03:33.019> and<00:03:33.260> they're<00:03:33.920> not<00:03:34.040> gonna

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
Bounce territory and they're not gonna

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.370 
Bounce territory and they're not gonna

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.140 
be able to penetrate you know my turret
it's<00:03:36.560> it's<00:03:36.739> almost<00:03:36.920> impossible<00:03:37.310> because<00:03:37.850> I'm

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
it's it's almost impossible because I'm

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.420 
it's it's almost impossible because I'm
leaning<00:03:38.540> back<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:38.959> the<00:03:39.050> angle<00:03:39.440> the<00:03:39.950> cupola<00:03:40.370> is

most part you know you're not going to
be<00:03:57.800> set<00:03:57.980> on<00:03:58.010> fire<00:03:58.340> I<00:03:58.370> found<00:03:58.760> that<00:03:58.940> in<00:03:59.180> about<00:03:59.480> 450

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
be set on fire I found that in about 450

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.060 
be set on fire I found that in about 450
battles<00:04:00.530> between<00:04:01.160> my<00:04:01.580> m103<00:04:02.060> and<00:04:02.600> the<00:04:02.840> e5<00:04:03.800> that

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:04.070 
battles between my m103 and the e5 that

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:06.250 
battles between my m103 and the e5 that
I<00:04:04.100> was<00:04:04.340> only<00:04:04.459> set<00:04:04.670> on<00:04:04.790> fire<00:04:05.060> about<00:04:05.420> five<00:04:06.049> times

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
I was only set on fire about five times

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.020 
I was only set on fire about five times
so<00:04:06.530> about<00:04:06.680> once<00:04:06.890> every<00:04:06.980> 90<00:04:07.280> battles<00:04:07.700> which<00:04:07.880> is

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
so about once every 90 battles which is

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.289 
so about once every 90 battles which is
an<00:04:08.239> acceptable<00:04:08.660> risk<00:04:09.130> the<00:04:10.130> t29<00:04:10.640> I've<00:04:11.000> tagged

00:04:11.289 --> 00:04:11.299 
an acceptable risk the t29 I've tagged

an acceptable risk the t29 I've tagged
him<00:04:11.450> a<00:04:11.510> couple<00:04:11.690> times<00:04:11.810> he's<00:04:12.140> now<00:04:12.290> dropped<00:04:12.560> down

to<00:04:12.739> one-shot<00:04:13.040> territory<00:04:13.760> I<00:04:14.000> should<00:04:14.420> be

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
what I've been doing is holding the edge

what I've been doing is holding the edge
hard<00:04:30.360> so<00:04:30.539> that<00:04:30.570> they<00:04:30.900> can't<00:04:31.169> come<00:04:31.229> up<00:04:31.380> and<00:04:31.710> look

hard so that they can't come up and look

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.279 
hard so that they can't come up and look

the most important thing is I got over
5,000<00:07:41.600> damage<00:07:41.840> blocked<00:07:42.080> which<00:07:42.380> is<00:07:42.500> a<00:07:42.530> pretty

00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:42.800 
5,000 damage blocked which is a pretty

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.500 
5,000 damage blocked which is a pretty
huge<00:07:43.070> number<00:07:43.460> for<00:07:43.490> a<00:07:43.640> tier<00:07:43.880> 8<00:07:43.910> battle<00:07:44.330> and

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:44.510 
huge number for a tier 8 battle and

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.420 
huge number for a tier 8 battle and
really<00:07:45.410> it's<00:07:45.530> just<00:07:45.590> a<00:07:45.890> credit<00:07:46.190> to<00:07:46.310> the

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:46.430 
really it's just a credit to the

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:49.030 
really it's just a credit to the
strengths<00:07:46.820> of<00:07:46.970> this<00:07:47.270> particular<00:07:47.600> tank<00:07:48.020> in<00:07:48.920> the

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.040 
strengths of this particular tank in the

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:50.500 
strengths of this particular tank in the
next<00:07:49.220> video<00:07:49.430> we're<00:07:49.520> gonna<00:07:49.610> look<00:07:49.730> at<00:07:49.850> the<00:07:49.970> m103

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:50.510 
next video we're gonna look at the m103

00:07:50.510 --> 00:07:52.540 
next video we're gonna look at the m103
I<00:07:50.780> think<00:07:51.140> it's<00:07:51.260> one<00:07:51.410> of<00:07:51.470> the<00:07:51.560> most<00:07:51.740> incorrectly

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:52.550 
I think it's one of the most incorrectly

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:53.860 
I think it's one of the most incorrectly
played<00:07:52.880> tanks<00:07:53.300> and<00:07:53.420> all<00:07:53.510> of

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:53.870 
played tanks and all of

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:56.500 
played tanks and all of
of<00:07:54.020> tanks<00:07:54.350> and<00:07:54.470> so<00:07:55.340> that's<00:07:55.610> up<00:07:55.790> next<00:07:56.150> hope<00:07:56.390> you

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:56.510 
of tanks and so that's up next hope you

00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:59.680 
of tanks and so that's up next hope you
enjoyed<00:07:56.690> the<00:07:56.810> video<00:07:56.960> take<00:07:57.470> care
