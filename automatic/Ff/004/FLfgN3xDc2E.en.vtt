you've<00:01:44.579> already<00:01:44.670> asked<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.000> question<00:01:45.180> I

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
you've already asked that question I

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.270 
you've already asked that question I
already<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.259> gone<00:01:46.409> through<00:01:46.710> that<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> said

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
already have gone through that I said

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.300 
already have gone through that I said
the<00:01:47.430> same<00:01:47.729> way<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.869> brain<00:01:49.530> started<00:01:50.100> out

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
the same way that that brain started out

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.670 
the same way that that brain started out
of<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.520> mud<00:01:50.700> hole<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.780> have<00:01:52.049> yet<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.320> tell

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
of a mud hole and you have yet to tell

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.100 
of a mud hole and you have yet to tell
us<00:01:52.890> what<00:01:53.130> your<00:01:53.340> naturalist<00:01:53.909> view<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:54.689> to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
us what your naturalist view is as to

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.440 
us what your naturalist view is as to
origins<00:01:55.829> you<00:01:56.040> said<00:01:56.430> you<00:01:56.610> don't<00:01:56.790> know<00:01:57.060> but<00:01:57.329> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
origins you said you don't know but you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.149 
origins you said you don't know but you
still<00:01:57.689> want<00:01:57.869> us<00:01:57.899> to<00:01:58.049> listen<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.500> what<00:01:59.009> you

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
still want us to listen to what you

still want us to listen to what you
don't<00:01:59.310> know<00:01:59.520> so<00:01:59.759> you<00:01:59.880> don't<00:02:00.000> believe<00:02:00.509> a<00:02:00.719> brain

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
don't know so you don't believe a brain

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.660 
don't know so you don't believe a brain
came<00:02:01.439> out<00:02:01.619> of<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> mud<00:02:01.979> hole<00:02:02.100> but<00:02:02.340> you<00:02:02.460> do

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
came out of a mud hole but you do

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.700 
came out of a mud hole but you do
believe<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.329> rotten<00:02:03.719> brain<00:02:03.990> can<00:02:04.229> think<00:02:04.469> is

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
believe that a rotten brain can think is

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.620

that what you're saying that's what you
saying<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.740> said<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.429> the<00:02:08.580> end<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.239> bar

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
saying you said that the end of the bar

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.910 
saying you said that the end of the bar
is<00:02:09.920> rotting<00:02:10.549> and<00:02:10.759> I'm<00:02:11.510> saying<00:02:11.870> that<00:02:12.379> the<00:02:12.620> brain

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
is rotting and I'm saying that the brain

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.030 
is rotting and I'm saying that the brain
actually<00:02:13.750> continues<00:02:14.750> on<00:02:14.959> now<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.530> want<00:02:15.830> to<00:02:15.890> know

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
actually continues on now I want to know

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
what you all believe as naturalist how

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.729 
what you all believe as naturalist how
did<00:02:21.980> it<00:02:22.129> all<00:02:22.310> come<00:02:22.340> to<00:02:22.790> be<00:02:22.940> going<00:02:23.690> Intel<00:02:24.049> trying

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
did it all come to be going Intel trying

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.979 
did it all come to be going Intel trying
to<00:02:24.860> tell<00:02:25.069> you<00:02:25.250> how<00:02:25.459> you<00:02:25.519> weren't<00:02:25.909> always<00:02:26.450> been

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:26.989 
to tell you how you weren't always been

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:31.089 
to tell you how you weren't always been
here<00:02:29.140> combinations<00:02:30.140> of<00:02:30.290> molecules<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.040> I

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
here combinations of molecules and I

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.069 
here combinations of molecules and I
think<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.640> atoms<00:02:31.970> of<00:02:32.090> hydrogen<00:02:32.269> in<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.810> Sun

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
think the atoms of hydrogen in the Sun

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:34.809 
think the atoms of hydrogen in the Sun
are<00:02:33.290> the<00:02:33.379> same<00:02:33.590> as<00:02:33.739> the<00:02:33.860> atoms<00:02:34.129> of<00:02:34.220> hydrogen<00:02:34.400> in

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
are the same as the atoms of hydrogen in

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:37.710 
are the same as the atoms of hydrogen in
your<00:02:35.090> John<00:02:35.540> did<00:02:36.140> you<00:02:36.170> say<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.530> think<00:02:36.860> that<00:02:36.980> a

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
your John did you say you think that a

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.899 
your John did you say you think that a
minute<00:02:38.720> did<00:02:38.959> you<00:02:38.989> say<00:02:39.230> you<00:02:39.290> think<00:02:39.620> that<00:02:39.909> has

00:02:40.899 --> 00:02:40.909 
minute did you say you think that has

00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:43.569 
minute did you say you think that has
anybody<00:02:41.239> been<00:02:41.510> to<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:41.900> Sun<00:02:42.109> and<00:02:42.440> measured<00:02:42.980> the

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
anybody been to the Sun and measured the

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.020 
anybody been to the Sun and measured the
molecules<00:02:44.030> of<00:02:44.180> hydrogen<00:02:44.299> on<00:02:44.660> the<00:02:44.750> Sun<00:02:46.030> well

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
molecules of hydrogen on the Sun well

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:53.920 
molecules of hydrogen on the Sun well
there's<00:02:52.269> you<00:02:53.269> don't<00:02:53.299> want<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:53.599> answer<00:02:53.810> that

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
there's you don't want to answer that

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.990 
there's you don't want to answer that
question<00:02:54.049> do<00:02:54.409> you<00:02:54.530> has<00:02:55.069> anybody<00:02:55.340> been<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:55.700> the

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
question do you has anybody been to the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.539 
question do you has anybody been to the
Sun<00:02:56.239> to<00:02:56.659> measure<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.170> molecules<00:02:57.709> of<00:02:58.370> hydrogen

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
Sun to measure the molecules of hydrogen

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.460 
Sun to measure the molecules of hydrogen
so<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.299> they<00:02:59.450> can<00:02:59.659> in<00:02:59.750> fact<00:02:59.989> prove<00:03:00.230> they're

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
so that they can in fact prove they're

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.170 
so that they can in fact prove they're
the<00:03:00.590> same<00:03:00.769> as<00:03:00.950> the<00:03:01.069> jaw<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:01.730> you<00:03:01.819> don't<00:03:01.970> have<00:03:02.090> to

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
the same as the jaw so you don't have to

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.940 
the same as the jaw so you don't have to
go<00:03:02.299> to<00:03:02.359> the<00:03:02.480> Sun<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:02.840> have<00:03:02.959> spectrometers<00:03:03.920> and

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
go to the Sun you have spectrometers and

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.130 
go to the Sun you have spectrometers and
other<00:03:04.190> instruments<00:03:04.519> that<00:03:04.930> religious<00:03:05.930> people

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
other instruments that religious people

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:07.750 
other instruments that religious people
don't<00:03:06.409> spend<00:03:06.650> too<00:03:06.769> much<00:03:06.920> time<00:03:06.980> you<00:03:07.459> know<00:03:07.549> what

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
don't spend too much time you know what
