about<00:02:23.890> the<00:02:24.010> halfway<00:02:24.190> point<00:02:24.370> of<00:02:24.880> in<00:02:25.209> time<00:02:25.510> with

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
about the halfway point of in time with

about the halfway point of in time with
you<00:02:25.959> he<00:02:26.770> started<00:02:27.160> revealing<00:02:27.459> himself<00:02:28.000> a

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
you he started revealing himself a

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.360 
you he started revealing himself a
little<00:02:28.270> bit<00:02:28.480> more<00:02:28.800> and<00:02:29.800> I<00:02:29.920> knew<00:02:30.070> at<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.250> point

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
little bit more and I knew at that point

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.580 
little bit more and I knew at that point
that<00:02:30.940> you<00:02:31.420> know<00:02:31.540> the<00:02:31.690> next<00:02:31.870> couple<00:02:32.260> stories

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
that you know the next couple stories

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.620 
that you know the next couple stories
were<00:02:32.800> going<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:33.280> have<00:02:33.400> this<00:02:33.610> his<00:02:34.030> perspective

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
were going to have this his perspective

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.539 
were going to have this his perspective
because<00:02:34.810> I<00:02:35.080> think<00:02:35.140> he<00:02:35.830> felt<00:02:36.070> comfortable<00:02:36.250> with

00:02:36.539 --> 00:02:36.549 
because I think he felt comfortable with

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:37.530 
because I think he felt comfortable with
me

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
me

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.009 
me
I<00:02:37.600> had<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.260> greater<00:02:38.560> understanding<00:02:38.739> of<00:02:39.340> him<00:02:39.670> and
