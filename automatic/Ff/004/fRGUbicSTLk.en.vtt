00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
right there with our 86 wires in here we

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.010 
right there with our 86 wires in here we
had<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.789> figure<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.210> how<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.750> without

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
had to figure out how to do this without

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.860 
had to figure out how to do this without
having<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.789> switch<00:00:59.789> on<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.120> exterior<00:01:00.539> or

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
having a switch on the exterior or

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.540 
having a switch on the exterior or
something<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.379> up<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.949> bottom<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.370> good

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
something so up in the bottom is a good

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.600 
something so up in the bottom is a good
idea<00:01:02.780> now<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.019> this<00:01:04.229> when<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.710> truck<00:01:05.580> is

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
idea now in this when the truck is

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.660 
idea now in this when the truck is

the next section of lights is the course

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.710 
the next section of lights is the course
headlights<00:02:14.230> the<00:02:14.769> headlights<00:02:15.129> are<00:02:15.480> nice<00:02:16.480> wide

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
headlights the headlights are nice wide

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.899 
headlights the headlights are nice wide
millimeter<00:02:17.170> LED<00:02:17.650> and<00:02:17.920> my<00:02:18.159> little<00:02:18.459> trick<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.700> do

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
millimeter LED and my little trick to do

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.460 
millimeter LED and my little trick to do
with<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.180> headlights<00:02:19.510> is<00:02:19.689> actually<00:02:20.110> to<00:02:20.200> paint

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
with the headlights is actually to paint

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.500 
with the headlights is actually to paint
the<00:02:20.620> end<00:02:20.769> of<00:02:20.920> the<00:02:21.010> lens<00:02:21.189> so<00:02:21.939> the<00:02:22.090> end<00:02:22.269> of<00:02:22.420> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
the end of the lens so the end of the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.149 
the end of the lens so the end of the
LED<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:23.049> painted<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.620> there's<00:02:23.799> no<00:02:23.920> light

00:02:24.149 --> 00:02:24.159 
LED is painted and there's no light

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.740 
LED is painted and there's no light
coming<00:02:24.370> out<00:02:24.549> the<00:02:24.730> end<00:02:24.849> it<00:02:25.000> all<00:02:25.120> reflects<00:02:25.510> back

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
coming out the end it all reflects back

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.819 
coming out the end it all reflects back
into<00:02:26.079> the<00:02:26.170> bucket<00:02:26.379> and<00:02:28.079> that's<00:02:29.079> the<00:02:29.260> stage<00:02:29.500> 2

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
into the bucket and that's the stage 2

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.009 
into the bucket and that's the stage 2
stage<00:02:30.310> 2<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.730> the<00:02:31.120> lighting<00:02:31.420> only<00:02:31.659> just<00:02:31.870> adds

stage 2 of the lighting only just adds
the<00:02:32.200> headlights<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.829> then<00:02:32.950> when<00:02:33.069> we<00:02:33.189> go<00:02:33.310> to

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
the headlights and then when we go to

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.960 
the headlights and then when we go to
stage<00:02:33.670> 3<00:02:34.379> stage<00:02:35.379> 3<00:02:35.739> adds<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.220> full<00:02:36.549> off-road

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
stage 3 stage 3 adds the full off-road

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
of ambient lighting in the interior so

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.140 
of ambient lighting in the interior so
we've<00:03:26.829> actually<00:03:27.040> got<00:03:27.310> some<00:03:27.489> little<00:03:27.910> white

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
we've actually got some little white

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:31.319 
we've actually got some little white
spots<00:03:28.540> here<00:03:29.230> at<00:03:29.409> low<00:03:29.590> wattage<00:03:30.120> just<00:03:31.120> right

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
spots here at low wattage just right

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.059 
spots here at low wattage just right
inside<00:03:31.659> here<00:03:31.690> there's<00:03:32.319> one<00:03:32.530> in<00:03:32.650> each<00:03:32.739> corner

00:03:33.059 --> 00:03:33.069 
inside here there's one in each corner

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.210 
inside here there's one in each corner
of<00:03:33.250> the<00:03:33.549> cabin<00:03:33.840> here<00:03:34.840> in<00:03:34.989> the<00:03:35.079> back<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.590> then

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
barely see and they're tucked underneath

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.680 
barely see and they're tucked underneath
the<00:03:39.280> seats<00:03:39.639> here<00:03:39.819> you<00:03:39.970> can<00:03:40.120> kind<00:03:40.299> of<00:03:40.329> see<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.599> in

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
the seats here you can kind of see it in

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.379 
the seats here you can kind of see it in
there<00:03:40.900> and<00:03:41.099> so<00:03:42.099> if<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:42.549> watch<00:03:42.760> in<00:03:43.000> there<00:03:43.209> I'll

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:43.389 
there and so if you watch in there I'll

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:45.360 
there and so if you watch in there I'll
turn<00:03:43.569> them<00:03:43.720> off<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:43.870> on<00:03:44.169> so<00:03:44.829> you<00:03:44.919> can<00:03:45.129> have<00:03:45.340> a

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
turn them off and on so you can have a

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.640 
turn them off and on so you can have a
see<00:03:45.659> you<00:03:46.659> kind<00:03:46.870> of<00:03:46.959> see<00:03:47.109> where<00:03:47.229> the<00:03:47.379> floor<00:03:47.620> is

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
the rim of the spare tire I cut a rim in

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.600 
the rim of the spare tire I cut a rim in
half<00:05:18.670> as<00:05:19.260> you<00:05:20.260> can<00:05:20.410> see<00:05:20.560> and<00:05:20.800> glued<00:05:21.250> a<00:05:21.370> little
