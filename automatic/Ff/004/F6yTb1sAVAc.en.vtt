00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
was probably the easiest of it made

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.330 
was probably the easiest of it made
weight<00:01:20.109> in<00:01:21.109> my<00:01:21.229> professional<00:01:21.679> career<00:01:21.890> which

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
weight in my professional career which

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.880

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
is which is which is pretty funny but I

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.429 
is which is which is pretty funny but I
do<00:01:25.789> believe<00:01:26.240> there<00:01:26.960> are<00:01:27.020> a<00:01:27.049> couple<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.320> little

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
do believe there are a couple of little

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.669 
do believe there are a couple of little
areas<00:01:27.890> that<00:01:28.219> I<00:01:29.000> tried<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:30.170> little<00:01:30.469> bit

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
areas that I tried a little bit

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.039 
areas that I tried a little bit
differently<00:01:31.130> that<00:01:31.310> that<00:01:31.520> may<00:01:31.880> have<00:01:32.689> or<00:01:32.899> have

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
differently that that may have or have

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.989 
differently that that may have or have
not<00:01:33.079> affected<00:01:33.619> me<00:01:33.920> in<00:01:33.950> certain<00:01:34.159> way<00:01:34.399> so<00:01:34.429> that

00:01:34.989 --> 00:01:34.999 
not affected me in certain way so that

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:37.359 
not affected me in certain way so that
there's<00:01:35.799> definitely<00:01:36.799> things<00:01:37.009> that<00:01:37.130> I'm<00:01:37.280> going

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
there's definitely things that I'm going

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.249 
there's definitely things that I'm going
to<00:01:37.429> get<00:01:37.579> back<00:01:37.759> to<00:01:38.030> what<00:01:38.659> I<00:01:38.689> used<00:01:38.960> to<00:01:39.079> do<00:01:39.229> that

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
to get back to what I used to do that

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.950 
to get back to what I used to do that
are<00:01:39.619> no<00:01:39.770> works<00:01:40.429> and<00:01:40.909> you<00:01:41.450> sort<00:01:41.600> of<00:01:41.659> get<00:01:41.780> to<00:01:41.929> a

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
are no works and you sort of get to a

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.690 
are no works and you sort of get to a
certain<00:01:42.380> stage<00:01:42.770> where<00:01:43.070> you<00:01:43.130> want<00:01:43.310> to<00:01:43.399> improve
