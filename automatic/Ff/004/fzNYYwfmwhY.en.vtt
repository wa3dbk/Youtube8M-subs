I<00:01:49.439> mean<00:01:49.700> what<00:01:50.700> we're<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.119> doing<00:01:51.329> here

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
I mean what we're going to be doing here

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.929 
I mean what we're going to be doing here
is<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:51.930> really<00:01:52.710> take<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.100> four<00:01:53.369> yards<00:01:53.790> at<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
is just really take it four yards at a

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.789 
is just really take it four yards at a
time<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.750> principle<00:01:54.960> behind<00:01:55.290> this

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
time that is the principle behind this

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.760 
time that is the principle behind this
scheme<00:01:56.329> it's<00:01:57.329> really<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.079> about<00:01:58.290> hitting<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
scheme it's really not about hitting the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
scheme it's really not about hitting the
major<00:01:59.040> plays<00:01:59.369> all<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.670> time<00:01:59.820> there<00:02:00.750> will<00:02:00.990> be

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
major plays all the time there will be

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.020 
major plays all the time there will be
one<00:02:01.380> or<00:02:01.500> two<00:02:01.530> plays<00:02:01.950> couple<00:02:02.460> plays<00:02:02.759> throughout

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
one or two plays couple plays throughout

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.010 
one or two plays couple plays throughout
the<00:02:03.210> game<00:02:03.390> where<00:02:03.630> you're<00:02:03.719> going<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:03.930> go

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
the game where you're going to go

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.810 
the game where you're going to go
negative<00:02:04.290> because<00:02:05.040> they<00:02:05.250> shed<00:02:05.549> like

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
negative because they shed like

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.630 
negative because they shed like
ridiculous<00:02:06.630> blocks<00:02:07.099> what<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.190> want<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.429> avoid

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
ridiculous blocks what you want to avoid

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.480 
ridiculous blocks what you want to avoid
is<00:02:08.910> fumbling<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:10.170> there<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.890> ways<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.310> do<00:02:11.430> that

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
is fumbling and there is ways to do that

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.060 
is fumbling and there is ways to do that
and<00:02:12.610> also<00:02:13.120> which<00:02:13.480> one<00:02:13.720> avoid<00:02:14.080> is<00:02:14.350> making<00:02:15.040> big

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
and also which one avoid is making big

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.030 
and also which one avoid is making big
mistakes<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:16.000> turnovers<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:17.350> you<00:02:17.410> know<00:02:17.740> keep

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
mistakes and turnovers so you know keep

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.530 
mistakes and turnovers so you know keep
that<00:02:18.250> in<00:02:18.400> mind<00:02:18.580> when<00:02:18.880> you're<00:02:18.940> selecting<00:02:19.180> your

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
that in mind when you're selecting your

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.360 
that in mind when you're selecting your
plays<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.140> figuring<00:02:20.800> out<00:02:20.800> what<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.160> want<00:02:21.340> to

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
plays and figuring out what you want to

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.880 
plays and figuring out what you want to
do<00:02:21.550> and<00:02:21.940> this<00:02:22.720> is<00:02:22.780> my<00:02:22.900> first<00:02:23.260> set<00:02:23.530> for<00:02:23.800> an

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
do and this is my first set for an

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.580 
do and this is my first set for an
audible<00:02:24.220> package<00:02:24.990> you<00:02:25.990> can<00:02:26.050> definitely<00:02:26.500> run

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
audible package you can definitely run

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.040 
audible package you can definitely run
with<00:02:26.770> different<00:02:27.100> sets<00:02:27.360> that's<00:02:28.360> just<00:02:28.660> I<00:02:28.840> think

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
with different sets that's just I think

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.250 
with different sets that's just I think
the<00:02:29.440> easiest<00:02:29.620> one<00:02:30.100> to<00:02:30.130> run<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.960> simplest<00:02:31.960> and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the easiest one to run and simplest and

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.680 
the easiest one to run and simplest and
the<00:02:32.290> cleanest<00:02:32.980> one<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.280> run<00:02:33.460> and<00:02:34.270> maybe<00:02:34.510> the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:34.690 
the cleanest one to run and maybe the

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.900 
the cleanest one to run and maybe the
best<00:02:34.840> one<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.260> don't<00:02:35.500> know<00:02:35.560> yet<00:02:35.590> really<00:02:36.580> depends

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
best one I don't know yet really depends

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.410 
best one I don't know yet really depends
on<00:02:37.090> you<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:38.530> know<00:02:38.740> your<00:02:38.980> type<00:02:39.190> of<00:02:39.430> skills

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
on you and you know your type of skills

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.720 
on you and you know your type of skills
and<00:02:40.750> what<00:02:40.930> abilities<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.830> plays<00:02:42.250> fits<00:02:42.580> you

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
and what abilities and plays fits you

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.510 
and what abilities and plays fits you
best<00:02:43.050> but<00:02:44.050> uh<00:02:44.080> i<00:02:44.590> think<00:02:45.100> i'm<00:02:45.250> going<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.430> go

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
best but uh i think i'm going to go

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.460 
best but uh i think i'm going to go
ahead<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.880> pick<00:02:46.210> a<00:02:47.400> bunch<00:02:48.400> z<00:02:49.330> spot<00:02:49.690> as<00:02:49.930> mine

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
ahead and pick a bunch z spot as mine

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.700 
ahead and pick a bunch z spot as mine
and<00:02:51.300> i'm<00:02:52.300> running<00:02:52.480> gore<00:02:52.870> is<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.260> running<00:02:53.530> back

to<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.870> single<00:03:31.870> bag<00:03:31.990> munch<00:03:32.290> tight<00:03:32.680> at<00:03:32.830> an

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
to the single bag munch tight at an

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.550 
to the single bag munch tight at an
angle<00:03:33.490> you<00:03:34.300> know<00:03:34.420> we<00:03:34.540> got<00:03:34.570> the<00:03:34.840> counter<00:03:35.260> we<00:03:35.410> got

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
angle you know we got the counter we got

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.920 
angle you know we got the counter we got
the<00:03:35.710> full-back<00:03:36.070> dive<00:03:36.310> we<00:03:36.520> got<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:36.790> toss<00:03:37.030> that

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:37.930 
the full-back dive we got the toss that

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.530 
the full-back dive we got the toss that
is<00:03:38.230> probably<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:38.890> most<00:03:39.160> vicious<00:03:39.640> 3-play

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
is probably the most vicious 3-play

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.200 
is probably the most vicious 3-play
combo<00:03:41.020> for<00:03:41.230> a<00:03:41.260> running<00:03:41.590> attack<00:03:42.210> especially

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
combo for a running attack especially

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:46.340 
combo for a running attack especially
out<00:03:43.870> of<00:03:43.990> this<00:03:44.080> formation<00:03:44.470> it<00:03:44.950> is<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:46.270> my

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
out of this formation it is in my

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.680 
out of this formation it is in my
opinion<00:03:47.350> far<00:03:48.250> superior<00:03:48.490> to<00:03:48.790> the<00:03:49.060> strong<00:03:49.330> close

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
opinion far superior to the strong close
