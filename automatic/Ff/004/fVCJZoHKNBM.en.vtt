a<00:01:32.030> good<00:01:32.510> measure<00:01:32.750> for<00:01:32.900> the<00:01:33.140> success<00:01:33.590> of<00:01:33.680> a

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:33.770 
a good measure for the success of a

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.260 
a good measure for the success of a
project<00:01:34.190> is<00:01:34.310> what<00:01:34.460> you<00:01:34.550> don't<00:01:34.670> hear<00:01:34.970> about<00:01:35.030> it

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
project is what you don't hear about it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.140 
project is what you don't hear about it
afterwards<00:01:35.900> and<00:01:36.190> it's<00:01:37.190> music<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.760> my<00:01:37.790> ears

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
afterwards and it's music to my ears

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.270 
afterwards and it's music to my ears
when<00:01:38.330> nobody<00:01:38.750> speaks<00:01:38.990> about<00:01:39.140> the<00:01:39.950> david

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
when nobody speaks about the david

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.090 
when nobody speaks about the david
project

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.190 

find<00:01:46.100> the<00:01:46.190> solution<00:01:46.700> has<00:01:47.090> got<00:01:47.390> to<00:01:47.540> be<00:01:47.660> to<00:01:48.020> get

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
find the solution has got to be to get

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.250 
find the solution has got to be to get
the<00:01:49.130> sensors<00:01:50.090> that<00:01:50.330> are<00:01:50.390> on<00:01:50.570> the<00:01:50.690> sides<00:01:50.930> of<00:01:51.110> the

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
the sensors that are on the sides of the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.320 
the sensors that are on the sides of the
cakes<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.680> proximity<00:01:52.280> sensors<00:01:52.730> built<00:01:53.150> into

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
cakes the proximity sensors built into

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.920 
cakes the proximity sensors built into
the<00:01:53.540> cakes<00:01:53.830> sensing<00:01:54.830> 100%<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.730> the<00:01:55.820> time<00:01:56.000> and<00:01:56.270> I

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
the cakes sensing 100% of the time and I

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.570 
the cakes sensing 100% of the time and I
think<00:01:57.170> when<00:01:57.320> we<00:01:57.410> can<00:01:57.590> get<00:01:57.770> that<00:01:57.950> problem

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
think when we can get that problem

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.400 
think when we can get that problem
resolved<00:01:59.240> and<00:01:59.810> where<00:01:59.960> we<00:02:00.050> can<00:02:00.200> get<00:02:00.320> the

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:00.410 
resolved and where we can get the

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.270 
resolved and where we can get the
pallets<00:02:01.000> resolved<00:02:02.000> only<00:02:02.990> then<00:02:03.170> would<00:02:03.979> I<00:02:04.040> be

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
pallets resolved only then would I be

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.730 
pallets resolved only then would I be
able<00:02:04.370> to<00:02:04.490> say<00:02:04.700> yeah<00:02:04.910> I<00:02:04.940> think<00:02:05.180> now<00:02:05.390> we<00:02:05.570> can<00:02:05.780> we

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
able to say yeah I think now we can we

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.509 
able to say yeah I think now we can we
can<00:02:06.920> take<00:02:07.040> that<00:02:07.220> off<00:02:07.400> as<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.640> 100%<00:02:08.330> success
