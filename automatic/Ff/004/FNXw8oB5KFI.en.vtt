00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.280
 paris is a natural recipe seeds and 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:09.709
 grape oil the veins that run 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.719
 our body are blood vessels 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.289
 responsible for bringing blood to 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:14.629
 heart 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.170
 therefore they play a very important role 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:20.660
 important in blood circulation 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:23.450
 however when they swell and they 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.300
 deformed are not able to comply with 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.720
 its function to offer a smooth flow of 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.960
 blood to the heart since it is 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.120
 is retained giving way to the appearance of 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.630
 what we usually know as 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.460
 Varicose veins Varicose veins 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:44.060
 usually develop in the 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.880
 legs and ankles however 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.190
 they can also appear in viscera and 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.309
 organs as is the case of the 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.130
 hemorrhoids condition in which 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.950
 generate varicose veins around the 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.739
 anus generating a great pain the veins 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.170
 They have a valve system that 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.989
 they prevent the backflow of blood and 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.880
 when they weaken 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.420
 a vein development factor 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.700
 varicose being the possible reasons 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.270
 that generate this situation of weakness 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.180
 for example the overweight 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:22.360
 pregnancy remain standing or sitting 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.030
 for long hours all these 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.850
 conditions are responsible for the 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.039
 appearance of varicose veins another condition that 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.189
 motivates the appearance of varicose veins 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:36.009
 is the condition thrombosis that 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.369
 characterized by the obstruction generated 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.409
 for the formation of blood clots 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:44.440
 which usually occurs at levels 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:47.619
 deep and therefore receives the name of 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:50.679
 Deep vein thrombosis most 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.039
 of the times is not so serious and can 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.929
 be cured with certain home remedies 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.959
 diet and the improvement of habits 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.840
 unhealthy as the postural changes 

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:05.259
 for example not to stay long 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.539
 standing or sitting including a base
