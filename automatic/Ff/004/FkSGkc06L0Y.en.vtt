exactly<00:01:34.220> standard<00:01:34.700> procedure<00:01:35.450> they've

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
exactly standard procedure they've

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.620 
exactly standard procedure they've
assured<00:01:36.530> me<00:01:36.950> that<00:01:37.160> when<00:01:37.880> the<00:01:37.970> pulse<00:01:38.149> radiates

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
assured me that when the pulse radiates

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.980 
assured me that when the pulse radiates
that<00:01:38.990> the<00:01:39.770> car<00:01:40.009> will<00:01:40.220> not<00:01:40.280> explode<00:01:40.789> so<00:01:41.300> like<00:01:41.869> to

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
that the car will not explode so like to

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:44.469 
that the car will not explode so like to
say<00:01:42.110> to<00:01:42.170> my<00:01:42.350> family<00:01:42.500> I<00:01:42.710> love<00:01:42.890> you<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.580> to<00:01:44.360> the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
switch the pulse came through find out

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.270 
switch the pulse came through find out
the<00:02:26.370> electronics<00:02:27.240> as<00:02:28.140> far<00:02:28.410> as<00:02:28.530> the<00:02:28.740> starter

that's<00:02:31.500> why<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.740> windows<00:02:32.190> still<00:02:33.030> work

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
that's why the windows still work

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.320 
there it just dies I'm traveling at the
speed<00:02:45.360> of<00:02:45.630> light<00:02:45.810> a<00:02:46.260> BMP<00:02:46.860> attack<00:02:47.490> would<00:02:47.940> strike

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
speed of light a BMP attack would strike

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.330 
speed of light a BMP attack would strike
everything<00:02:48.990> directly<00:02:49.470> in<00:02:49.590> its<00:02:49.770> line<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.100> sight

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
everything directly in its line of sight

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.300 
everything directly in its line of sight
the<00:02:51.300> higher<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.780> altitude<00:02:51.900> the<00:02:52.290> greater<00:02:53.040> the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
the higher the altitude the greater the

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.360 
the higher the altitude the greater the
devastation<00:02:54.000> at<00:02:54.690> 30<00:02:55.140> miles<00:02:55.410> above<00:02:55.800> the<00:02:56.010> United

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
devastation at 30 miles above the United

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.340 
devastation at 30 miles above the United
States<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.060> device<00:02:57.360> would<00:02:57.660> have<00:02:57.690> back<00:02:57.930> up<00:02:58.200> to

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
States the device would have back up to

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.420 
States the device would have back up to
half<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.590> dozen<00:02:58.920> states<00:02:59.870> but<00:03:00.870> at<00:03:01.110> 300<00:03:01.950> miles<00:03:02.160> of

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
half a dozen states but at 300 miles of

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.370 
half a dozen states but at 300 miles of
the<00:03:02.580> whole<00:03:02.790> continent<00:03:03.360> of<00:03:03.570> North<00:03:03.630> America

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
the whole continent of North America

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.220 
the whole continent of North America
would<00:03:04.860> be<00:03:05.010> brought<00:03:05.280> to<00:03:05.580> an<00:03:05.700> irreversible

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
would be brought to an irreversible

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.230 
would be brought to an irreversible
standstill
