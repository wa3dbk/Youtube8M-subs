00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.380
 good summer kids are already going 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:26.300
 we are approaching autumn 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.800
 i already see the first primros to bloom 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.329
 thoughts will also begin soon and from now on 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.839
 we will talk about all the plants of autumn and winter 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.590
 is one of the plants that blooms all winter is already starting from 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.810
 December approximately the end of November and December 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.900
 and the flowering can last depends on where we place it until April 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.030
 that abundant flowering 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.280
 and it is a plant that can be placed also in garden in pots and 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.280
 planters where we want 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.789
 on the second floor that 

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:09.740
 we have to cultivate lanÃ­n bierno 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.780
 it is important especially because 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.510
 as we do not know what winter will come to us if you are going to have a rainy winter 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.430
 habanero dry winter 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.859
 it is important to place it in the base of the pots 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.280
 in reborn in such a way that it gets in a very rainy winter we do not have the 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.120
 constantly waterlogged plant 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.010
 I'm going to show you two types of drainage that we can place in the pots for 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.120
 to avoid the flooding of the courts we have this one that was given 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.450
 must volcanic 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:46.970
 the experts 2 the two things become called is like one of the villas 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.500
 and it's very porous is a very material by the joint controls 6 was very 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.750
 well the water and the air the two things 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.230
 and then we have skate tracks and expanded 

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:02.230
 jesus bothers us very light 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.820
 who is also his wife in turn 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.470
 and 11 reb unda because it never compacts then only so much lets me pass very 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.089
 well the water and the air 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.449
 a good orientation for this city plant the east 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:17.399
 at sunrise 

00:02:17.399 --> 00:02:21.449
 when the sun's rays are softer and another a room could be the 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:22.489
 west too 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.459
 the south in the face of winter we do not have very strong rays of the sun 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:30.149
 and then the plant further developed easily 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:34.469
 but to the south 

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:35.599
 in March or April 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.589
 this plant breaks down easier 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:42.389
 in the ideal temperature for the growth and flowering of the plant 

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.849
 well to be about 12 and 22 degrees 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.989
 the plant that withstand the cold year 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.329
 what happens that for the growth that signed today a proper approval 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:56.029
 from 12 degrees is when the plant is active 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:59.389
 when it drops below 12 degrees and the plant remains as 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.399
 oo asleep it's green and it's pretty or it can have flowers but it's not that it's going to 

00:03:03.399 --> 00:03:05.759
 bloom more and it is like a little paralyzed 

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:07.509
 in flower times 

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:10.959
 it is important to remove these flowers that have withered 

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:14.789
 because if you are not suns you ended up imposing 

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:17.909
 they are rotting arrest that has around 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.619
 totes fish an important task 

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:25.089
 It is not a plant that requires excessive careful but like all 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:27.389
 plants that in the goshawks 

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:30.389
 in time of flowering it is important 

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:35.400
 the contribution of fertilizers especially so that I continued with force looking for 

00:03:35.399 --> 00:03:36.729
 all the winter 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:37.999
 it could be done 

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:42.019
 well applying a granulated fertilizer at the time of planting me one with work not what 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:43.520
 that can last us until 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.839
 three four months 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:48.389
 we could also do it with a soluble fertilizer 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:50.519
 applying every week 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.549
 and yes no liquid fertilizer that can also be applied all week 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.559
 It is not a plant that requires excessive risk because above all we are in 

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:00.449
 winter and in winter we have 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:03.579
 cold humidity then 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.670
 sunny days are the days that are a little bit then when 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:09.919
 we should apply a little water 

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:14.279
 I take care of a little bit special you have to give them from february march that they start 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:15.279
 to warm up 

00:04:15.279 --> 00:04:17.039
 the first rays of the sun 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:21.070
 and the plant may seem to lack water 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.999
 i touched the substrate 

00:04:22.999 --> 00:04:26.689
 we must have a moist substrate but despite this the plant remains as 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:27.939
 as the cia 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:31.490
 then we should spray a little water to cool 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.490
 the primroses also have their guests 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.110
 in the end it bothers him 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.930
 then one of the most important pests in stimulation to be 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.199
 in the lungs we all know how 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:47.860
 sucks the sap from the plants as it is one of the important fringes of the 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:48.740
 first 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.529
 as well as the white fly 

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:52.279
 that response those prevented 

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:54.969
 we introduce the earth an ecstasy pill 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:57.400
 here the little plant that mule 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.699
 will not have any white fly aphids and looking is the safest thing is that 

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:04.089
 neither because he also acted very well against the worms 

00:05:04.089 --> 00:05:08.780
 Another of the important summer fragas are usually the famous ones 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.689
 snails 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:13.229
 that is to hide face 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.229
 the winter they respond but the slugs are active then 

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:20.759
 they are the ones that damage the leaves in the area and the primroses applying them a 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:22.089
 little bit of granulate 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:23.580
 a count to put 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.900
 young we would avoid holes in our plants 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.370
 good since I carry all of vacations and to alleviate a little the syndrome of 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.370
 post-vocational point is that that country that we have 

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:38.789
 plants that can help us 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:42.559
 the balconies the pots and planters we wanted to sing at home
