00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hey my dear and welcome 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.810
 to a doodle surfing tuesday 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.360
 I want to show you today as I feel 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.700
 sewn this jersey dress and how 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:14.389
 ye also very easy for young 1 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.389
 can take 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.560
 so my dear that is now mine 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.210
 spread fabric that's the dress 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.250
 what i use as a cut pattern 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.689
 you want and you should choose 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.119
 of the fabric pay attention that all 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.400
 parts really take care of the fabric 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.100
 I would use it now either 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.870
 tailors no scissors in any case 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.360
 trace the parts and then 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.890
 cut out and then that is now 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.110
 the part i do for the top 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.970
 I would like to use now 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.399
 first my dress to make sure 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:48.960
 that there is enough space everywhere 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.180
 I do not really need a new entry 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.410
 pay attention why I share the parts too 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.160
 simply cut out with scissors 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.719
 can 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.420
 That's where I'm going to put it 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.730
 upperside and then at the edge 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.879
 cut along as I approach 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.140
 must pay attention to the same things 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.390
 I now with the front and the 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.970
 fall for the rock then I can too 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.780
 quite simply at the seam of the dress 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.850
 cut along and through that 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.619
 I'll get a little bit kinked, too 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.619
 exactly the shape I need 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.460
 that would be the cut out rock 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.890
 form and that's what my parts look like 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.590
 I need this for the dress here 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.390
 are the sleeves I have now 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.609
 taken twice and cut out that 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.079
 So we are the front part and that 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.079
 the two back parts for the dress 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:58.250
 of course now an opera love machine 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.349
 Of course you can also do a normal one 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.780
 Sewing machine and a zigzag stitch 

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:04.670
 or a degree stich and a twins 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.539
 needle then use this together 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.099
 connect to 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.750
 because I have an overlack machine 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:09.289
 I'll be me, of course, too 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:11.660
 use 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.329
 this is this one with the four rolls 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.879
 behind and that creates an elastic 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.799
 approaching what cloths are perfect 

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:21.140
 So now I'm taking mine 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:24.019
 front part and my back part of the 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.310
 top parts and put these two on the 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.959
 shoulders with each other and I take 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.940
 then also on the upper lure machine 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.160
 almost what is great about it is that they are the 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.980
 Remains on the side with the same way 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.849
 cuts and I'm such a clean seam 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.940
 get and in the end I can also 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.099
 just cut off so that looks 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.799
 approaching a overlooked machine so 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.840
 this is now the finished shell 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.340
 so to speak that's different now 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.989
 and the good thing about the overlook machine 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.760
 is really that you sew nothing 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.739
 must or so the stitches hold 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.650
 Just like that if you end up with that 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:03.819
 nor should because you have nothing 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.739
 do something else that is very very 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.930
 handy and very fast and very fast 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.060
 It definitely looks like 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.610
 so at least one of the tops works 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.530
 So now I have the rock ready 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:17.230
 mowed the turn I now synonymous times 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.209
 and now I basically have to 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.549
 only inside these two parts 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.989
 sewing together so very important to me 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:27.340
 I have this wrong around here 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:28.769
 so put in both content 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.409
 really has the right side and 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:33.609
 outside, so to speak, where I now closer 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.310
 that's just these two printed pages 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:38.709
 lie on each other and there I go now 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.810
 once around and then the dress is 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.780
 hopefully already done 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:45.849
 that would be solid enough now 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.470
 Of course, the sleeves are missing 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.810
 we already have that before 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.329
 cut and they should now 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:54.700
 just turn around and do that 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.750
 I'll just put these two axels 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.540
 I'll call them parts now 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.519
 on each other and then sew them on 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.590
 the overlook machine firmly as we 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:05.859
 before with the two shoulders 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.900
 and then I turn 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.329
 Of course, the sleeve will do the same, too 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:11.680
 with the second and now I should 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:12.280
 actually a twin needle 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:14.230
 use 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.120
 Unfortunately, that does not work for me now 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:19.930
 That's why I just take the 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:21.690
 normal needle and close to the sleeve with 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.099
 I gossiped along 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.690
 since it is a pity that he is now 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:27.760
 not elastic I have now 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.220
 anyway, just put two in it 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.860
 optics to fake a bit if he does 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.440
 still want to have it elastic 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.870
 like a zigzag stitch of the looks 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.650
 not so nice but fulfilled 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:44.349
 its purpose and around the sleeve now with 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:46.270
 the axel hole into it is now time to time 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:49.120
 I connect now as well 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:52.200
 in here and near a turn-around for the 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.400
 that looks like that 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.380
 this is the dress that looks 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.720
 pretty much done but still missing 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.370
 a crucial part here 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.090
 probably have seen that 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:03.430
 collar 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.530
 and that's actually easier too 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:10.000
 you just need it for that 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:11.320
 a longer strip of cloth and if 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.150
 you should not be long enough then 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.110
 just connect it again 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:16.360
 another 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.460
 It is only important now 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:20.320
 that you pay attention to the paths 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.470
 should be just like me 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.890
 here and not like here at my 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.770
 Collar because otherwise beats wrong 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:31.870
 I then form a ring and 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.170
 I beat this on the edges 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.750
 on each other and just put them on 

00:05:35.170 --> 00:05:38.290
 the edge of the dress and then sew around 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.300
 around 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:42.220
 I still have it with needles 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.310
 pinned to make it better when sewing 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:48.550
 stops and not as I said once 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:51.280
 all around and that looks from the inside 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:53.890
 so it should look like and from 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:55.540
 outside so and now even better 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:59.040
 You can fix it here again 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:06:01.360
 to go straight along a degree 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:03.010
 I'm coming to the rock now 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.080
 unfortunately a bit odd, too 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.490
 a bit longer at the front than at the back 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.230
 I'll do it again 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:10.420
 and if I did that then 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.700
 I'll just knock down and 

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.890
 Nidda again with a degree I am 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.720
 along the edge you can optional 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:18.720
 but also use a zigzag stitch
