let's<00:00:46.680> try<00:00:46.890> loading<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.370> tubing<00:00:48.500> first<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
let's try loading the tubing first you

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.470 
let's try loading the tubing first you
want<00:00:50.100> to<00:00:50.160> open<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.550> pump<00:00:50.760> by<00:00:51.030> turning<00:00:51.300> the

release<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.210> retainer<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.920> open<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.039> door

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
release the retainer and open the door

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.139 
release the retainer and open the door
now<00:00:57.320> lift<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.379> latch<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:59.370> release<00:00:59.670> and<00:00:59.969> open

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
now lift the latch to release and open

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.830 
now lift the latch to release and open
the<00:01:00.660> inclusion<00:01:01.109> bed<00:01:01.289> I<00:01:01.879> time<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.539> it

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the inclusion bed I time that it it

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.830 
the inclusion bed I time that it it
helps<00:01:04.339> to<00:01:05.339> align<00:01:05.640> one<00:01:06.030> roller<00:01:06.299> with<00:01:06.720> the

the<00:02:35.160> inlet<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.760> outlet<00:02:36.420> side<00:02:36.660> just<00:02:37.590> so

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:37.739 
the inlet and the outlet side just so

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.250 
the inlet and the outlet side just so
that<00:02:37.920> when<00:02:38.069> i<00:02:38.100> turn<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.550> drive<00:02:38.819> on<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.510> it

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
that when i turn the drive on and it

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.140 
that when i turn the drive on and it
starts<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.709> run<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.250> make<00:02:41.430> sure<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.730> tubing<00:02:42.060> is

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
starts to run to make sure the tubing is

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.630 
starts to run to make sure the tubing is
not<00:02:42.180> creeping<00:02:42.810> through<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.170> pump<00:02:43.410> if<00:02:43.890> by

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
not creeping through the pump if by

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.910 
not creeping through the pump if by
chance<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.090> does<00:02:45.360> just<00:02:46.019> take<00:02:46.200> the<00:02:46.230> retainer

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
chance it does just take the retainer

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.229 
chance it does just take the retainer
knob<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.760> give<00:02:47.940> it<00:02:48.000> one<00:02:48.209> more<00:02:48.239> good<00:02:48.750> turn<00:02:50.239> that

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
knob and give it one more good turn that

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.130 
knob and give it one more good turn that
concludes<00:02:51.720> you're<00:02:52.410> ready<00:02:52.709> to<00:02:52.950> run
