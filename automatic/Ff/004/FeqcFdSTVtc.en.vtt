flock<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.629> birds<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.769> you<00:02:19.829> have<00:02:20.069> the<00:02:20.250> actor

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
flock of birds so you have the actor

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.539 
flock of birds so you have the actor
actually<00:02:20.940> wearing<00:02:21.840> he's<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> bird<00:02:22.680> he<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.250> one

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
actually wearing he's a bird he is one

has<00:02:26.130> three<00:02:26.430> more<00:02:26.610> birds<00:02:26.940> so<00:02:27.239> he's<00:02:27.420> he's<00:02:28.019> almost

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
has three more birds so he's he's almost

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.920 
has three more birds so he's he's almost
like<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.470> corporate<00:02:29.069> puppet<00:02:29.459> he<00:02:29.940> is<00:02:30.060> not<00:02:30.269> one

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
like a corporate puppet he is not one

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.470 
like a corporate puppet he is not one
one<00:02:31.560> character<00:02:32.129> but<00:02:32.340> he's<00:02:32.519> many<00:02:32.849> characters

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
one character but he's many characters

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.660 
one character but he's many characters
and<00:02:33.750> when<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.290> had<00:02:34.470> to<00:02:34.620> have<00:02:34.829> a<00:02:35.099> herd<00:02:35.400> of

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
and when you had to have a herd of

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.180 
and when you had to have a herd of
gazelles<00:02:36.269> or<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.410> stampede<00:02:37.980> of<00:02:38.099> the

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
gazelles or the stampede of the

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.160 
gazelles or the stampede of the
wildebeests<00:02:38.760> I<00:02:38.790> had<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.060> find<00:02:39.299> various<00:02:40.049> ways

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
wildebeests I had to find various ways

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.619 
wildebeests I had to find various ways
of<00:02:40.650> creating<00:02:40.890> multiples<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:42.060> sometimes<00:02:42.480> you

00:02:42.619 --> 00:02:42.629 
of creating multiples so sometimes you

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.259 
of creating multiples so sometimes you
have<00:02:42.660> a<00:02:43.079> dancer<00:02:43.860> who<00:02:44.069> will<00:02:44.190> have<00:02:44.370> three<00:02:44.730> masks

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
have a dancer who will have three masks

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.150 
have a dancer who will have three masks
and<00:02:45.450> there<00:02:45.720> there<00:02:46.170> are<00:02:46.200> three<00:02:46.410> wildebeests

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
and there there are three wildebeests

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.780 
and there there are three wildebeests
and<00:02:48.049> for<00:02:49.049> the<00:02:49.140> principles<00:02:49.709> we<00:02:50.040> actually<00:02:50.519> have

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
and for the principles we actually have

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.539 
and for the principles we actually have
masks<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.840> are<00:02:51.900> worn<00:02:52.319> off<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.829> the<00:02:52.950> actors<00:02:53.370> in

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
masks that are worn off of the actors in

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:54.289 
masks that are worn off of the actors in
different<00:02:53.850> places

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
different places

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.020 
different places
the<00:02:54.569> Mufasa<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.650> scar<00:02:55.950> masks<00:02:56.459> are<00:02:56.609> worn<00:02:56.850> like

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
the Mufasa and scar masks are worn like

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.509 
the Mufasa and scar masks are worn like
headdresses<00:02:57.540> on<00:02:57.930> top<00:02:58.260> of<00:02:58.440> the<00:02:58.560> actors<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.430> you

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
headdresses on top of the actors so you

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:01.849 
headdresses on top of the actors so you
see<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> actors<00:03:00.329> face<00:03:00.600> you<00:03:01.290> get<00:03:01.470> all<00:03:01.620> of<00:03:01.769> the

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
human part of the actor but the animal

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.180 
human part of the actor but the animal
is<00:03:06.030> represented<00:03:06.690> by<00:03:06.720> the<00:03:06.870> mask<00:03:07.230> on<00:03:07.530> top<00:03:07.799> and

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:13.109 
for instance can you spread spread open

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:14.960 
for instance can you spread spread open
a<00:03:13.200> little<00:03:13.319> bit<00:03:13.440> like<00:03:13.680> that<00:03:13.709> you<00:03:14.310> get<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.670> sense

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
a little bit like that you get the sense

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.150 
a little bit like that you get the sense
of<00:03:15.239> what<00:03:15.540> would<00:03:15.660> be<00:03:15.840> feathers<00:03:16.260> here<00:03:16.709> but<00:03:17.040> it's

designer Michael curry is a genius on
mechanics<00:03:42.570> and<00:03:42.900> he<00:03:43.560> actually<00:03:44.070> invented

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
mechanics and he actually invented

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.340 
mechanics and he actually invented
invent<00:03:45.450> that<00:03:45.600> what<00:03:45.750> you're<00:03:45.900> hearing<00:03:46.080> over

there<00:03:46.530> is<00:03:46.710> the<00:03:46.860> steam<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.310> has<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.760> go<00:03:47.850> off

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
there is the steam that has to go off

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.690 
there is the steam that has to go off
okay<00:03:48.330> he<00:03:48.780> invented<00:03:49.290> this<00:03:49.470> technique<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:50.550> that

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
okay he invented this technique so that

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.030 
okay he invented this technique so that
with<00:03:51.360> a<00:03:51.390> very<00:03:51.720> simple<00:03:52.020> movement<00:03:52.710> that<00:03:52.860> is

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
with a very simple movement that is

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.010 
with a very simple movement that is
expressive<00:03:53.610> from<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.850> shoulders<00:03:54.330> of<00:03:54.540> the

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:55.020 
expressive from the shoulders of the

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.380 
expressive from the shoulders of the
actor<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.590> actually<00:03:56.100> can<00:03:56.280> create<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:57.180> whole

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
actor you actually can create the whole

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.570 
actor you actually can create the whole
group<00:03:57.630> of<00:03:57.840> them<00:03:57.900> flying<00:03:58.350> yeah<00:03:58.950> were<00:03:59.520> you

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
group of them flying yeah were you

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.940 
group of them flying yeah were you
yourself<00:04:00.330> a<00:04:00.450> little<00:04:00.690> surprised<00:04:01.200> that<00:04:01.380> Disney
