00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.840
 this has 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:13.120
 8th 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.730
 joho people of simple entertainment 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.410
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.310
 little tutorial again about the 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:28.689
 premium pro at this time ccm i had someone 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.310
 I am writing ice tube 404 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.280
 invented may tutorial with the render so 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.809
 for the mac quite cool but had one 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.399
 So he's the first question I have 

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.680
 already answered me and second 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.840
 ask yes he has the test person of it 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.280
 downloaded and wanted to 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.610
 cut video and then we have 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.559
 Of course, imported as normal yes 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.059
 So he goes to the concert at the club 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.949
 means that I climb the 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.609
 different on the incisions 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.440
 can reinziehen him appear at 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.789
 It seems to me that top left and me 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.829
 bottom left is not a problem though 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:02.089
 is not bad anyway yes 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.309
 can not pull it in the bar and 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:07.180
 edit exactly and the same problem 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.040
 I also have adobe premiere pro cch 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.960
 but I am now a net maker 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.280
 tutorial for that because I have the book 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.570
 and I have about it for a long time 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.159
 pondering how to do it 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.630
 but I found out so 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.590
 First, you import something 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.850
 who in club I have sometime 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.890
 prepared fraps movies and easy 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:26.090
 nothing more a reader then it will be 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.869
 now the beautiful inserted so then goes 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.850
 one on file new sequence then yes 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.100
 simply sequence 1 then press ok 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.539
 because at the premiere pro cs4 he should 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.320
 Getting asked in the beginning like sequence 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.649
 to be called 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.820
 wants it or automatically 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.020
 This was automatically the 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.479
 cut window sill individual traces 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.180
 created okay and since we have that 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.950
 cut window yes then you can see that 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.210
 just as always very good there 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.409
 it has not changed anything 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.229
 Change sequence decision bla bla bla 

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:55.670
 bla there you can already look so 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.920
 the usual actually all quite 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.060
 just yes and I think that we 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.039
 not difficult now 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.600
 I'll get the tutorial right now 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:03.710
 We'll be right back after only 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.020
 I knew it soon 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.750
 for mac because on the mac 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.610
 does it also a function 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.380
 actually just as well but yes again 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.090
 a little different almost exactly the same again 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.230
 a bit different and we the people, the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.670
 mac have me not natural 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.940
 disadvantaged because I have so well in 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.020
 Erkner and then for the people 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.310
 we can have windows now 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.409
 then I thank you for switching off 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.840
 spectators and thank you and see you 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:29.150
 next time 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.370
 Here we are again and make it this time 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.650
 we do the whole mac for the mac 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.030
 is a little easier better said there 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.730
 I also just because I have now only 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.260
 26 but that's about the same thing 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.930
 We start the whole krimskrams times 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.310
 again as always ballade tenberge 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:44.890
 landstrich that works for me 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.629
 fortunately relatively fast 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.250
 usually not always but so here 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.540
 is that so I have six now 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.670
 but that can not keep up with how much 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.080
 different so here goes is then first the 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.330
 new project that is also quite normal 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:00.590
 at adobe premiere pro cs4 also that 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.329
 so ok for pictures and named 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.790
 and then ask yourself that right here 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.739
 new sequence that's just what 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.900
 at adobe several per cc not am 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:12.709
 the beginning comes but where you then on 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.690
 file new and sequence must go so well 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.489
 then just okay so would the whole 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.670
 whole came started so then we would have 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.290
 that too young people there we are 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:23.690
 again and this time you do the whole thing 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.790
 for mac yes at merck is a little 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.560
 easier, that's the way I have it 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.989
 only I have now so about 6 but that 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.489
 is about the same way we start 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.489
 the whole junk like again 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:35.480
 always so Tenberge was ballade country underlined 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.579
 luckily, that works for me 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.319
 quite fast 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:40.940
 usually not always but so here 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.099
 is that so now I have x 10.6 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.720
 but that can not be otherwise 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.940
 Here is the first project 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.380
 that is also quite normal in the 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.340
 premiere pro cs4 also from either of 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:54.049
 BÃ¼nder unnamed okay we stride that way 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.510
 and then ask yourself that right here 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:58.430
 new sequence that's just what 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.590
 at adobe several processes are not on 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.430
 the beginning comes but where you then on 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.530
 file new and sequence must go so well 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.180
 and just okay so the whole thing awaits 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.389
 whole came started so then we would have 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.829
 that's the way it is now at about 6 then 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:16.070
 You can do that here as well 

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.049
 here make new sequence and then have 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.970
 we're the same okay and then we have 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:20.989
 here also the cut window yes that 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.650
 Tutorial was actually pretty easy 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.940
 and well, there are probably many people here 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.110
 problem and no real 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.510
 tutorial did not do too 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.800
 youtube and google searched 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.270
 yes, if you liked it, it would be 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:34.130
 cool if the thumb up there 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.539
