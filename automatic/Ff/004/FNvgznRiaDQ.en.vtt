00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.560
 with everyone good in this video I'm going to 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.620
 speak in a very simple and very 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.450
 summary about muscle fibers 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.130
 maybe you think this means does not have much 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.980
 utility but it is essential that what 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.660
 let's understand if we want to understand the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.150
 following videos may be a tad more 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.310
 complete I made a small table 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.929
 classificatory so that we understand that 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.330
 the human body there are three types of 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:28.850
 fibers 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.850
 On the one hand we have the slow fibers and 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:33.770
 On the other hand we have fast fibers 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:35.750
 the slow ones are type 1 fibers and they are 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.570
 those of slow oxidation while the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.220
 faster are type 2 fibers and type 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.350
 2b which are the oxidation glue 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.610
 fast policy and political policies 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.590
 fast 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.990
 we have to understand that the distribution 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.700
 of the fibers ie the predominance of 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.680
 one with respect to others for example the 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.750
 fast compared to slow is 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.190
 genetically determined you were born with 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.500
 a certain distribution of these 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.450
 fibers this would explain for example that 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.790
 certain people are very good at 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:05.180
 a sport of strength but quite bad 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.040
 or in worse proportion in sports of 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.170
 resistance and it's precisely because of this 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.670
 for its predominance of some fibers 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:15.369
 fast compared to slow fibers 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.680
 as we can observe the type 1 fibers 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.659
 that is to say the slow paintings have a 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.090
 very slow contraction speed and a 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.740
 contraction force very low if the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.810
 we compare with the fast ones we can see 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.640
 that they have a speed of 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.560
 very fast contraction and a force of 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.070
 very high shrinkage both the fibers 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.799
 type 2 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.140
 as the type 2 p fibers therefore 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.450
 we can deduce that the type 1 beasts 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.250
 slow migrations are not the most 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.530
 are not the most powerful 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.860
 muscle is people and consequently a 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.539
 person who has a distribution 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.369
 priority of type 1 fibers is not going to be 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.990
 good in strength sports however 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:52.149
 yes it will be very good people by test of 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.759
 resistance because as we can observe 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.009
 The fatigability of these fibers is very 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.640
 falls much lower than the fibers 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.709
 type 2 and type 2b fibers but good 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.869
 this is even clearer when 

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:07.330
 we attend to your aerobic capacity and your 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.340
 anaerobic capacity because we can 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:12.040
 observe how fiber is type 1 have 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.739
 a very good aerobic capacity 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.719
 however the fiber is type 2a and 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:20.140
 Type 2 fiber have a capacity 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:21.969
 very low aerobic this means that 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.269
 a person a predominant fibers type 

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:24.609
 two 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:26.950
 vivientes type 2b ie fibers 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.590
 fast is not going to be anything good in 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.560
 resistance 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.569
 However, it will be very good in 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.330
 how to sports features 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:39.680
 anaerobic which is where the 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.680
 fibers type 1 slow fibers 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.209
 one of the fundamental characteristics 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.760
 of the slow fibers ie profiles 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.730
 type 1 is that they have a high density 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:53.790
 capillary and is therefore so too 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.829
 it is called the red fiber because 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.180
 have a higher capillary density have 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.280
 higher concentrations of 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.860
 hemoglobin very much more than fiber 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:04.260
 is type 2 and the type 2 fibers that are 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.690
 fast fibers on the other hand we have 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.730
 to understand that between the fiber is kind 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.010
 1 are the slowest and type 2 fibers 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:15.420
 which are the fastest we have a point 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.129
 intermediate in the books 2a now very 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.989
 explained the distribution of the fibers 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.840
 It depends mainly on our 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:24.209
 genetic but through training 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.459
 in one way or another we can make 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.950
 these fibers types two are closer 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.000
 to the first type 1 or closer 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.260
 to type 2 fibers 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.570
 say that with a training of 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:36.540
 resistance fiber is type 2 it 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.310
 would approximate more bad type 1 fibers 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.500
 we will improve our resistance and the 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.160
 Hall force type 2 fibers 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.770
 would improve by adapting something similar to 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.420
 type 2b fibers it can be said that 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.830
 fibers type 2 to which are the intermediates 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.570
 can be transformed depending on the 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.770
 training so despite 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.920
 be limited in terms of distribution 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.270
 of fibers genetically with the 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.340
 training we can improve towards a 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.980
 side or towards another 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.599
 the activation of muscle fibers 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.849
 depends on the size of your motor unit 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.830
 as we can see the type 1 fibers 

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:10.840
 they have a very large motor unit size 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.080
 small compared to the worst types 2 a 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:15.840
 type 2 fibers vÃ©lez whose size of 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.859
 motor unit is the largest of all 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.109
 what this means is that the 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.780
 very light surveys only 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.580
 would activate the type 1 fibers that are 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.860
 that have a motor unit size more 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.550
 small and as we add weight to 

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.470
 the bar 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.530
 little by little they would go away they would be activating 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.230
 first it 's type 1 fibers and I put the 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:37.880
 sooner fibers 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:40.190
 the maximum fiber recruitment 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:41.870
 muscles would be produced in pesos in 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.210
 Port ranges nearby student of 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.410
 paddle in which it is compulsory 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:47.569
 active 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.729
 2b 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.039
 size of motor unit that is the most 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:54.080
 great of all this is one of the 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:55.699
 fundamental principles of 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.610
 strength training since 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:05:01.009
 with maximum weights with close to 1 rm 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.929
 is when the activation of 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:05.240
 all the muscle fibers both 

00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:07.129
 fast as slow they have to 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.240
 activate first before you activate it 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:09.800
 this type of orbs 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.599
 well this has been all about 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.910
 muscle fibers I hope you have 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:16.250
 stayed a little clearer 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.930
 and study it and understand it because although 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.400
 everything is not explained I think it's the 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.290
 basis so we can understand the 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.580
 next videos so nothing see you 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:24.580
 the following once to all
