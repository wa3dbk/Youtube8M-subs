think I said that Roswell happened in
1945<00:00:33.570> obviously<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.440> did<00:00:34.590> not<00:00:34.739> happen<00:00:35.010> in<00:00:35.690> 1947

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
time I was in the Illuminati so I'm much

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.729 
time I was in the Illuminati so I'm much
much<00:04:11.069> older<00:04:11.310> than<00:04:11.669> I<00:04:11.790> look<00:04:11.819> but<00:04:12.599> I<00:04:12.959> was<00:04:13.410> not<00:04:13.560> in

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
much older than I look but I was not in

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.180 
much older than I look but I was not in
charge<00:04:13.950> of<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:14.310> um<00:04:15.380> basically<00:04:16.380> he<00:04:16.739> was<00:04:16.829> coming

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
charge of it um basically he was coming

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.250 
charge of it um basically he was coming
to<00:04:17.220> to<00:04:18.060> terms<00:04:18.359> with<00:04:18.539> the<00:04:18.660> fact<00:04:18.690> that<00:04:18.959> we<00:04:19.139> were

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
to to terms with the fact that we were

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.469 
to to terms with the fact that we were
just<00:04:19.289> about<00:04:19.590> to<00:04:19.739> wrap<00:04:20.010> up<00:04:20.250> humanity<00:04:20.940> perhaps

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
just about to wrap up humanity perhaps

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.520 
just about to wrap up humanity perhaps
and

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
and

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.760 
and
the<00:04:22.590> Anunnaki<00:04:23.040> were<00:04:23.190> coming<00:04:23.580> and<00:04:23.700> so<00:04:24.770> he

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
the Anunnaki were coming and so he

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.260 
the Anunnaki were coming and so he
thought<00:04:26.040> it<00:04:26.250> might<00:04:26.460> be<00:04:26.580> a<00:04:26.610> good<00:04:26.670> idea<00:04:26.850> that

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270 
thought it might be a good idea that

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:28.610 
thought it might be a good idea that
when<00:04:27.389> they<00:04:27.480> got<00:04:27.690> here<00:04:27.930> they<00:04:27.990> saw<00:04:28.320> all<00:04:28.590> of

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:28.620 
when they got here they saw all of

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.070 
when they got here they saw all of
humanity<00:04:29.340> combined<00:04:30.300> together<00:04:30.480> you<00:04:30.960> know

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
humanity combined together you know

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.870 
humanity combined together you know
working<00:04:31.380> together<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:32.070> nothing<00:04:32.310> seems<00:04:32.790> to

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
working together and nothing seems to

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.640 
working together and nothing seems to
bring<00:04:33.210> people<00:04:33.389> together<00:04:33.630> like<00:04:34.080> a<00:04:34.110> threat<00:04:34.500> from

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
bring people together like a threat from

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.060 
bring people together like a threat from
the<00:04:34.800> outside<00:04:35.250> in<00:04:35.700> in<00:04:36.690> fact<00:04:37.020> nothing<00:04:37.800> brings

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
the outside in in fact nothing brings

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.920 
the outside in in fact nothing brings
people<00:04:38.280> together<00:04:38.730> like<00:04:39.120> a<00:04:39.360> threat<00:04:39.600> from<00:04:39.750> the

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
people together like a threat from the

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.450 
people together like a threat from the
outside<00:04:40.350> that's<00:04:40.620> about<00:04:40.889> the<00:04:40.980> only<00:04:41.040> thing<00:04:41.190> that

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
outside that's about the only thing that

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:43.990 
outside that's about the only thing that
will<00:04:41.580> bring<00:04:41.910> people<00:04:42.270> together<00:04:42.440> unfortunately

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
will bring people together unfortunately

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.840 
will bring people together unfortunately
we're<00:04:45.000> very<00:04:45.210> cooperative<00:04:45.870> species<00:04:46.500> but<00:04:47.010> you

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
we're very cooperative species but you

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.930 
we're very cooperative species but you
know<00:04:48.110> when<00:04:49.110> we<00:04:49.200> get<00:04:49.320> threatened<00:04:49.790> then<00:04:50.790> we

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
know when we get threatened then we

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.870 
know when we get threatened then we
really<00:04:51.240> come<00:04:51.389> together<00:04:51.540> and<00:04:52.400> so<00:04:53.400> he<00:04:53.669> thought

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
really come together and so he thought

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.450 
really come together and so he thought
hey<00:04:54.150> let's<00:04:54.450> see<00:04:54.960> if<00:04:55.169> we<00:04:55.320> come<00:04:55.680> together<00:04:55.830> you

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
hey let's see if we come together you

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.870 
hey let's see if we come together you
know<00:04:56.580> after<00:04:56.820> that<00:04:57.450> disk<00:04:57.750> crash<00:04:58.050> and<00:04:58.440> no<00:04:59.370> they

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
know after that disk crash and no they

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.170 
know after that disk crash and no they
didn't<00:05:00.210> they<00:05:00.390> just<00:05:00.570> didn't<00:05:00.840> care<00:05:00.990> so<00:05:02.120> you<00:05:03.120> know

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180 
didn't they just didn't care so you know

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:04.730 
didn't they just didn't care so you know
that<00:05:03.390> idea<00:05:03.660> was<00:05:03.780> all<00:05:03.870> out<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.080> window<00:05:04.350> he

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
that idea was all out the window he

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.050 
that idea was all out the window he
didn't<00:05:04.980> really<00:05:05.070> follow<00:05:05.310> through<00:05:05.669> anyway

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
didn't really follow through anyway

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:07.760 
didn't really follow through anyway
because<00:05:06.270> you<00:05:06.630> know<00:05:06.720> if<00:05:06.930> he<00:05:07.080> thought<00:05:07.320> through

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
because you know if he thought through

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:09.590 
because you know if he thought through
he<00:05:08.280> would<00:05:08.430> find<00:05:08.669> out<00:05:08.790> that<00:05:08.850> when<00:05:09.060> the<00:05:09.150> Anunnaki

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 
he would find out that when the Anunnaki

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.909 
he would find out that when the Anunnaki
got<00:05:09.780> here<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.169> they<00:05:10.230> saw<00:05:10.440> us<00:05:10.560> all<00:05:10.710> working

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
got here and they saw us all working

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.650 
got here and they saw us all working
together<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.850> very<00:05:12.030> thing<00:05:12.240> that<00:05:12.300> brought<00:05:12.600> us

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
together the very thing that brought us

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.630 
together the very thing that brought us
together<00:05:12.960> it<00:05:13.290> would<00:05:13.440> be<00:05:13.590> them<00:05:13.919> and<00:05:14.220> then<00:05:14.430> we

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
together it would be them and then we

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.370 
together it would be them and then we
would<00:05:14.790> probably<00:05:15.000> attack<00:05:15.540> them<00:05:15.870> and<00:05:16.110> then<00:05:16.260> they

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
would probably attack them and then they

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.400 
would probably attack them and then they
would<00:05:16.560> kill<00:05:16.830> us<00:05:16.860> anyway<00:05:17.390> anyway<00:05:18.390> it<00:05:19.200> wouldn't

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:19.410 
would kill us anyway anyway it wouldn't

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:22.040 
would kill us anyway anyway it wouldn't
work<00:05:19.620> either<00:05:19.800> way<00:05:20.040> but<00:05:20.970> yeah<00:05:21.660> that's<00:05:21.840> the
