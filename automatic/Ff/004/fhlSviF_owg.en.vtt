00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 This node is called the fishnet lush 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.809
 bollards rapport is 6 loops this 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:14.250
 this means that the number of loops must be a multiple of 6 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:16.230
 6 in 1 17 and at the end of the set you need 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.949
 add 2 loops that is just me 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:26.930
 get 20 now I'm doing the first 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:36.090
 loop and dial 20 air loops 1 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:41.190
 2 3 4 5 and so on all i need 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:44.820
 dial 20 so I gained 20 air 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.829
 loops now i need to climb i 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:56.280
 tie 3 air loops 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:59.250
 1 2 3 dancing the dog this hook and skipping 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.190
 data 3 loops in the fourth one that is in 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:08.810
 first on the corner I knit a column with 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:13.350
 nakida then 2 air loops and 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:14.720
 here I am knitting the second column with 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.320
 nakidom 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.310
 getting the first element of this pattern 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.830
 so now i will knit the next 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.479
 element is a lush durable column 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.299
 I miss two air loops on a chain 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:37.250
 I do a nakid and here in this loop that is 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:38.610
 nakid pull the thread then nakid again 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:45.020
 pulling the thread 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:48.390
 This already 2 nakid I pull the thread and nakid and 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.710
 I pull the thread that is only 4 times to me 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:56.530
 need to pull the thread with dan 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:00.500
 this loop then I connect all 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.880
 loops and fasten this column 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.390
 so I get a magnificent 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.390
 strong column 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:20.020
 now i need to bind skip 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:23.200
 rather 2 air loops below and here 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:28.750
 here connect the same item as 1 then 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:33.790
 there is a double crochet then two 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:38.620
 air and here is another column with 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:43.270
 nakida so get here 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.250
 such is knitting further knitting 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.860
 repeats now i need 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:54.550
 miss two air and visit again 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:03:00.870
 skin column consisting here elongated 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:05.070
 these loops 3 and 4 through all the loops and 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:09.520
 fasten the air then let down 2 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:16.900
 air down and knit with posts 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:19.930
 nakida two air and the same vessel another 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:23.380
 column so here are the elements 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.360
 repeated there are two columns lush 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.220
 column two column lush durable 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:33.280
 column so you need to link to the end of the row 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.590
 I donate the gift of knitting 1 row skip 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:41.970
 two air see two columns with 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:45.970
 nakida first column 2 2 air 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:48.760
 the second bar and now I have left so 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:52.330
 Now I kind of see there was one 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:58.900
 loop not and I knit a double crochet this 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:02.710
 there will be a side bar like this 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:05.890
 it will be and now I need to dial 3 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:10.400
 air loops to climb and 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:13.970
 next I will knit the second row 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.579
 so on second row lush durable 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:16.880
 posts will be linked here in these 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.289
 here 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.370
 elements that is now i need here 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:32.030
 in the first element 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:36.889
 link such a column so it is 1 2 3 and 4 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:40.250
 collect all the loops and fasten so 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.440
 then I'm in this item 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.139
 that is, where I have a magnificent durable 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.650
 column on the previous slush row that is 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:53.150
 here I knit double crochets first 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:05:00.380
 column 2 air and here the second 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:05:02.240
 A column is obtained such a pattern 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:11.389
 and so on, then here goes 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:15.500
 lush durable time two three 4 5 we hover 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:17.870
 through all the loops and fasten on here 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.880
 Accordingly, here in this lush will 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.699
 knit such an element of two 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:26.169
 double crochets dock this row 

00:05:22.699 --> 00:05:28.520
 turn to knitting until the end 

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:32.690
 repeated that is the third row will be 

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:34.610
 as 1 so I add the second row 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.490
 practically already to the end and 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:40.430
 here I will have a sidebar here 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:44.030
 are you attached to the top air 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:52.340
 chain loops on the previous row somewhere 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:56.659
 gone sharpness sharpness now i'm here 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:59.289
 here I wind up the upper air column 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:59.289
 double crochet 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:07.289
 that's the way I continue to knit again 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:10.680
 chain of 3 air loops and repeat 

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:11.879
 the first row that is here in this 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:13.319
 lush column 

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:22.050
 I will have a strong column 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:23.520
 knit crochet bars and 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.830
 so on then there is further and for not 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.300
 repeated 

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:34.319
 imposing the required number of rows 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:36.719
 and so I connected several rows that is 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:37.500
 I have here two three four five 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:41.039
 six rows 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:43.169
 here is such a pattern turns out a layer of rows you 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:45.620
 choose for yourself as well as 

00:06:43.169 --> 00:06:49.219
 number of loops 

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.219
 get the same
