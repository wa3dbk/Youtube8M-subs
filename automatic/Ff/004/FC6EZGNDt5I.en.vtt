00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.420
 I do n’t know somehow everything came spontaneously 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.580
 thought gray why don't we 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.410

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:30.330
 in the mountains after we visited ac3 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.120

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.380
 can we do it in Ukraine and 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.059
 decided that we can go to bukovel 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.129
 the more so because we have friendly 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.720
 relationship with the director of this resort and 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.120

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.640

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.520
 anyway the city is the city as it were 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:11.610
 a large crowd of people here it is not 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.830
 here we can say everything is set 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.830

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:43.110
 training here is such a mode you know 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.730
 there is such there is such a scheme 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.200
 Naturally I throughout 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.200
 the time that i do boxing i 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.870

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.400

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.820
 pass then naturally we take them for 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.280
 base and hone if something goes not 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.920
 so we postpone them and make that 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.290
 work that turns out well 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.440
 Well of course the mother of repetition exercises 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.030

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:24.830

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.630
 they show phenomenal 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.800
 some abilities its the same 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.500
 the boxer doesn't need to invent anything 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.780
 if you beat well 1 2 you can this 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.130
 so twos to develop that no one with this 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.130
 two can't cope 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.180
 Well, honestly, I looked at it 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.030
 dude i thought 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:54.180
 definitely can not even get it 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.250
 in the body area somewhere not at all in the shoulder 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.500
 not in hand because but really 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.620
 streams are now healthy trapezoid splint 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.780
 all by himself he was a giant when 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.220
 was weighing you know I went out 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:11.400
 weighting and a crowd of people who 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.100
 attended they started their type but 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.260
 he came out and I went out and they started like that well 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.120
 there is laughing getting something in between 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.250
 like what look 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.250
 came out such a skinny guy and such 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.430
 the big fellow for me is not the first time to go 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.560
 against such giants there are healthy 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.150
 some harder we were no harder 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.200
 this one was of the same weight even there on 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:36.630
 kilogram seems to be less than me 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.400
 absolutely no fears before 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.970
 healthy guy who can well 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:44.630

 I also want to can hit decently 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.840
 In general, when I left 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.900
 when I was introduced I was very happy 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:01.650
 know so pleased and eye and 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.269
 inside I looked a large amount 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.390
 people in the hall yes there but if there 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:09.000
 the capacity was there 12,000 about 12-13 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:12.180
 then I think ten thousand unequivocally on 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.780
 my fights were present and great 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.340
 the number of our flags that is in different 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.519
 points where the light fell 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.030
 i saw flags people shouted supported 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.970

 look at the wallpaper vladimir because i 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:42.210
 I think that before this fight, they somehow I 

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.770
 I think that they did not know who such 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:49.940
