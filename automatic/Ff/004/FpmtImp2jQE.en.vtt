hello all

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.880 
hello all
Clif<00:00:05.940> cramp<00:00:06.270> in<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.080> video<00:00:07.440> I'm<00:00:07.560> going<00:00:07.770> to

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
Clif cramp in this video I'm going to

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.180 
Clif cramp in this video I'm going to
take<00:00:08.240> the<00:00:09.240> same<00:00:10.050> silhouetted<00:00:10.740> treat<00:00:10.980> I<00:00:11.040> went

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
take the same silhouetted treat I went

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.799 
take the same silhouetted treat I went
ahead<00:00:11.280> and<00:00:11.429> cleaned<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.090> up<00:00:12.300> just<00:00:12.599> a<00:00:12.780> little

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
ahead and cleaned it up just a little

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.010 
ahead and cleaned it up just a little
bit<00:00:13.110> more<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.620> turned<00:00:13.889> it<00:00:14.009> into<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.280> grayscale

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
bit more and turned it into a grayscale

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.260 
bit more and turned it into a grayscale
and<00:00:16.020> I'll<00:00:16.350> show<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.710> in<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.940> particular

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
and I'll show you in this particular

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.320 
and I'll show you in this particular
video<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.990> way<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.010> start<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.730> develop<00:00:20.789> the

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
video a way to start to develop the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.790 
video a way to start to develop the
foliage<00:00:21.689> light<00:00:22.350> side<00:00:22.650> dark<00:00:23.010> side<00:00:23.330> and<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.990> have

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
foliage light side dark side and I have

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.759 
foliage light side dark side and I have
several<00:00:26.070> different<00:00:26.220> techniques<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.449> this

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:27.769 
several different techniques to do this

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:31.759 
several different techniques to do this
or<00:00:28.769> how<00:00:29.010> to<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.340> this<00:00:29.519> I<00:00:29.760> could<00:00:30.199> just<00:00:31.199> do<00:00:31.380> direct

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
or how to do this I could just do direct

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.560 
or how to do this I could just do direct
paint<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.369> still<00:00:32.610> in<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.820> grayscale<00:00:33.329> right

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
paint and still in the grayscale right

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.750 
paint and still in the grayscale right
now<00:00:33.719> I<00:00:33.750> haven't<00:00:33.989> considered<00:00:34.680> color<00:00:35.219> remember

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
now I haven't considered color remember

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.560 
now I haven't considered color remember
I<00:00:35.790> start<00:00:36.329> with<00:00:36.510> shape<00:00:37.200> form<00:00:37.649> color<00:00:38.070> detail<00:00:38.570> so

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
I start with shape form color detail so

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.090 
I start with shape form color detail so
in<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.870> one<00:00:40.079> I'm<00:00:40.200> starting<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:40.500> develop<00:00:40.620> more

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
in this one I'm starting to develop more

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.010 
in this one I'm starting to develop more
of<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.280> form<00:00:41.579> but<00:00:41.670> I<00:00:41.820> am<00:00:42.149> going<00:00:42.540> to<00:00:42.629> keep<00:00:42.809> it

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
of the form but I am going to keep it

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.779 
of the form but I am going to keep it
pretty<00:00:43.320> much<00:00:43.700> still<00:00:44.700> in<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:45.410> grayscale<00:00:46.440> as<00:00:47.430> I<00:00:47.730> do

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
pretty much still in a grayscale as I do

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.450 
pretty much still in a grayscale as I do
this<00:00:48.090> again<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.840> can<00:00:48.989> direct<00:00:49.289> paint<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.739> I<00:00:50.100> can

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
this again I can direct paint it I can

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.250 
this again I can direct paint it I can
bring<00:00:53.460> me<00:00:53.699> in<00:00:53.910> a<00:00:54.270> particular<00:00:54.690> texture<00:00:55.050> which

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
bring me in a particular texture which

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.200 
bring me in a particular texture which
I'll<00:00:55.410> show<00:00:55.559> you<00:00:55.590> in<00:00:55.739> another<00:00:55.890> video<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.579> then

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
I'll show you in another video and then

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.270 
I'll show you in another video and then
in<00:00:57.449> this<00:00:57.660> one<00:00:57.770> what<00:00:58.770> I'll<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.129> I'll<00:00:59.250> just

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
in this one what I'll do is I'll just

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.299 
in this one what I'll do is I'll just
show<00:00:59.609> you<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.820> few<00:00:59.940> brush<00:01:00.480> techniques<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.980> some

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
show you a few brush techniques and some

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.509 
show you a few brush techniques and some
layer<00:01:02.520> function<00:01:03.030> techniques<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:04.369> get<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
layer function techniques to get the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.850 
layer function techniques to get the
desired<00:01:05.909> effect<00:01:06.060> or<00:01:06.630> at<00:01:06.750> least<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.110> start<00:01:07.500> of

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
desired effect or at least the start of

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.810 
desired effect or at least the start of
the<00:01:08.820> desired<00:01:09.180> effect<00:01:09.540> that<00:01:09.750> I<00:01:09.780> want<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.890> what

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
the desired effect that I want so what

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.280 
the desired effect that I want so what
I'm<00:01:11.880> going<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.030> do<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.390> create<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.840> new<00:01:13.049> layer

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
I'm going to do is create a new layer

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.820 
I'm going to do is create a new layer
and<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:14.540> come<00:01:15.540> on<00:01:15.570> over<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.500> my

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
and then come on over to my

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.539 
and then come on over to my
impressionist<00:01:18.110> brush<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.950> this

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
impressionist brush and on this

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.580 
impressionist brush and on this
particular<00:01:21.210> layer<00:01:21.570> what<00:01:21.930> I'm<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.140> to<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.350> is

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
particular layer what I'm going to do is

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.620 
particular layer what I'm going to do is
take<00:01:22.979> the<00:01:23.159> layer<00:01:23.340> function<00:01:23.970> and<00:01:24.180> I'm<00:01:24.270> going<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
take the layer function and I'm going to

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.469 
take the layer function and I'm going to
go<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.350> overlay<00:01:26.130> what<00:01:26.790> this<00:01:26.909> essentially<00:01:27.330> does

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
go to overlay what this essentially does

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.840 
go to overlay what this essentially does
is<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.470> almost<00:01:28.680> creates<00:01:29.100> what's<00:01:29.369> underneath

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
is it almost creates what's underneath

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.859 
is it almost creates what's underneath
as<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.090> mask<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:32.310> won't<00:01:32.729> be<00:01:32.880> painting<00:01:33.600> even

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
as a mask so I won't be painting even

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.740 
as a mask so I won't be painting even
though<00:01:34.049> I<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.409> way<00:01:34.829> out<00:01:34.860> into<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.090> negative

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
though I go way out into the negative

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.730 
though I go way out into the negative
space<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.740> won't<00:01:38.130> be<00:01:38.670> showing<00:01:39.509> well<00:01:40.500> I'll

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
space here it won't be showing well I'll

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.100 
space here it won't be showing well I'll
demonstrate<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.579> right<00:01:41.820> now<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.060> if<00:01:42.420> I<00:01:42.509> if<00:01:43.020> I

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
demonstrate that right now so if I if I

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.819 
demonstrate that right now so if I if I
go<00:01:44.009> to<00:01:44.070> white<00:01:44.790> and<00:01:45.210> again<00:01:45.299> scaling<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.530> and

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
go to white and again scaling up and

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.830 
go to white and again scaling up and
down<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.159> my<00:01:47.310> brush<00:01:47.610> by<00:01:47.850> using<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.329> option

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
down on my brush by using the option

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.960 
down on my brush by using the option
command<00:01:49.229> key<00:01:49.520> I'll<00:01:50.520> go<00:01:50.670> ahead<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.210> start<00:01:51.810> to

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
command key I'll go ahead and start to

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:57.230 
command key I'll go ahead and start to
just<00:01:54.259> develop<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.649> light<00:01:56.310> side<00:01:56.640> with<00:01:57.030> some

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
just develop a light side with some

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.670 
just develop a light side with some
texture<00:01:58.229> here<00:01:58.969> and<00:01:59.969> what<00:02:00.509> I'm<00:02:00.600> gonna<00:02:00.689> do<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.350> go

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
texture here and what I'm gonna do is go

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.399 
texture here and what I'm gonna do is go
ahead<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.219> bring<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.149> opacity<00:02:03.180> down<00:02:04.079> to

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
ahead and bring the opacity down to

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.570 
ahead and bring the opacity down to
about<00:02:05.040> 50%<00:02:06.560> on<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.979> because<00:02:08.310> I<00:02:08.369> want<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
about 50% on this because I want to

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.589 
about 50% on this because I want to
creep<00:02:08.910> up<00:02:09.090> on<00:02:09.379> creep<00:02:10.379> up<00:02:10.560> on<00:02:10.709> it

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
creep up on creep up on it

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:15.160 
creep up on creep up on it
and<00:02:12.040> we'll<00:02:13.040> just<00:02:13.540> start<00:02:14.540> to<00:02:14.689> develop<00:02:14.930> this

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
and we'll just start to develop this

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.300 
and we'll just start to develop this
with<00:02:15.379> a<00:02:15.409> larger<00:02:15.890> brush<00:02:16.400> first<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.560> then<00:02:18.829> if<00:02:19.129> I

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
with a larger brush first and then if I

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.140 
with a larger brush first and then if I
go<00:02:19.519> darker<00:02:20.060> here<00:02:21.069> it<00:02:22.069> will<00:02:22.310> give<00:02:22.640> me<00:02:22.879> a<00:02:22.909> little

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
go darker here it will give me a little

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.819 
go darker here it will give me a little
bit<00:02:23.269> more<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:24.319> mid-tone<00:02:25.040> and<00:02:26.319> some<00:02:27.319> lights

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:27.829 
bit more of a mid-tone and some lights

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.280 
bit more of a mid-tone and some lights
it's<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:30.730> attribute<00:02:31.730> of<00:02:31.909> the<00:02:32.359> impressionist

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
it's the attribute of the impressionist

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.559 
it's the attribute of the impressionist
brush<00:02:33.560> gives<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.310> few<00:02:34.640> different<00:02:34.700> values

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
brush gives you a few different values

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.099 
brush gives you a few different values
and<00:02:36.290> if<00:02:36.439> I<00:02:36.560> bring<00:02:37.220> back<00:02:37.280> here<00:02:37.939> into<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.750> dark

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:39.109 
and if I bring back here into the dark

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:43.569 
and if I bring back here into the dark
press<00:02:39.500> a<00:02:39.530> little<00:02:39.709> harder<00:02:39.859> on<00:02:40.400> my<00:02:41.920> Wacom<00:02:42.920> tablet

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
press a little harder on my Wacom tablet

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.629 
press a little harder on my Wacom tablet
start<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.120> develop<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.810> little<00:02:44.989> bit<00:02:45.109> more<00:02:46.010> of<00:02:46.370> a

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:46.639 
start to develop a little bit more of a

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.110 
start to develop a little bit more of a
dark<00:02:46.909> value<00:02:47.510> it's<00:02:48.109> some<00:02:48.349> dark<00:02:48.590> under<00:02:49.340> the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
dark value it's some dark under the

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.319 
dark value it's some dark under the
underside<00:02:50.810> of<00:02:50.840> the<00:02:51.109> tree<00:02:51.379> here<00:02:51.739> and<00:02:51.970> I'm<00:02:52.970> just

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.329 
underside of the tree here and I'm just

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.839 
underside of the tree here and I'm just
playing<00:02:53.750> with<00:02:53.959> again<00:02:54.560> trying<00:02:55.310> to<00:02:55.430> create<00:02:55.669> my

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
playing with again trying to create my

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.509 
playing with again trying to create my
light<00:02:56.030> side<00:02:56.329> in<00:02:56.540> my<00:02:56.689> dark<00:02:56.930> side<00:02:57.169> with<00:02:57.530> this

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:58.519 
light side in my dark side with this

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.860 
light side in my dark side with this
particular<00:02:59.000> value<00:02:59.180> now<00:02:59.359> if<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.599> go<00:02:59.780> to<00:03:00.250> a

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
particular value now if I go to a

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.289 
particular value now if I go to a
smaller<00:03:02.870> brush<00:03:03.379> I<00:03:03.980> can<00:03:04.340> kind<00:03:04.730> of<00:03:04.790> bounce<00:03:05.030> back

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:05.299 
smaller brush I can kind of bounce back

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.429 
smaller brush I can kind of bounce back
and<00:03:05.659> forth<00:03:05.750> when<00:03:06.049> we<00:03:06.139> go<00:03:06.290> here<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:07.090> white<00:03:08.090> and

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
and forth when we go here to white and

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:15.550 
and forth when we go here to white and
we<00:03:09.439> will<00:03:09.739> just<00:03:10.750> get<00:03:11.750> some<00:03:12.139> smaller<00:03:14.019> leaves<00:03:15.019> and

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
we will just get some smaller leaves and

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.180 
we will just get some smaller leaves and
things<00:03:15.709> like<00:03:15.919> that

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
things like that

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.640 
things like that
and<00:03:16.489> again<00:03:16.879> this<00:03:17.060> isn't<00:03:17.329> necessarily<00:03:18.139> to<00:03:18.379> get

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
and again this isn't necessarily to get

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:24.580 
and again this isn't necessarily to get
me<00:03:18.949> to<00:03:19.250> detail<00:03:19.909> yet<00:03:20.269> it's<00:03:20.479> just<00:03:20.720> to<00:03:20.870> get<00:03:21.169> me<00:03:23.590> to

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
me to detail yet it's just to get me to

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.670 
me to detail yet it's just to get me to
a<00:03:24.620> point<00:03:25.430> where<00:03:25.849> I<00:03:26.389> can<00:03:26.959> get<00:03:27.079> to<00:03:27.139> detail

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
a point where I can get to detail

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.539 
a point where I can get to detail
actually<00:03:28.209> so<00:03:29.379> we're<00:03:30.379> just<00:03:30.409> going<00:03:30.829> to<00:03:31.069> continue

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
actually so we're just going to continue

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:41.469 
actually so we're just going to continue
to<00:03:35.500> develop<00:03:36.500> this<00:03:37.659> texture<00:03:38.659> here<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:40.609> again

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:41.479 
to develop this texture here and again

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:43.599 
to develop this texture here and again
you<00:03:41.720> can<00:03:41.870> notice<00:03:42.049> that<00:03:42.530> I<00:03:42.590> can<00:03:42.889> go<00:03:43.010> way<00:03:43.310> out

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609 
you can notice that I can go way out

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.729 
you can notice that I can go way out
over<00:03:43.790> here<00:03:44.090> it's<00:03:44.329> not<00:03:44.540> adhering<00:03:45.139> to<00:03:45.169> anything

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:45.739 
over here it's not adhering to anything

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:47.619 
over here it's not adhering to anything
because<00:03:45.949> it<00:03:46.280> isn't<00:03:46.430> overlay<00:03:46.909> layer<00:03:47.120> so<00:03:47.510> it's

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:47.629 
because it isn't overlay layer so it's

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.229 
because it isn't overlay layer so it's
just<00:03:48.260> a<00:03:48.409> gearing<00:03:48.799> adhering<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:52.239> value

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
just a gearing adhering to the value

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.860 
just a gearing adhering to the value
that's<00:03:53.590> underneath<00:03:54.590> and<00:03:55.010> like<00:03:55.340> I<00:03:55.430> said<00:03:55.669> before

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:55.870 
that's underneath and like I said before

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.369 
that's underneath and like I said before
essentially<00:03:56.870> creating<00:03:57.349> a<00:03:57.590> mask<00:03:59.109> will<00:04:00.109> drop<00:04:00.139> a

00:04:00.369 --> 00:04:00.379 
essentially creating a mask will drop a

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:02.140 
essentially creating a mask will drop a
little<00:04:00.650> bit<00:04:00.769> down<00:04:01.069> here<00:04:01.579> get<00:04:01.790> a<00:04:01.849> little<00:04:02.060> bit

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
little bit down here get a little bit

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.149 
little bit down here get a little bit
smaller<00:04:02.540> with<00:04:02.870> some<00:04:03.079> of<00:04:03.199> these<00:04:05.530> darker<00:04:06.530> values

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.399 

and<00:04:10.159> again<00:04:10.430> I<00:04:10.459> can<00:04:10.699> go<00:04:10.879> into<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.389> exterior<00:04:11.840> and

00:04:12.399 --> 00:04:12.409 
and again I can go into the exterior and

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.120 
and again I can go into the exterior and
always<00:04:13.009> adjusting<00:04:13.699> what<00:04:14.659> you're<00:04:14.840> doing<00:04:15.139> so<00:04:15.500> we

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
always adjusting what you're doing so we

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.640 
always adjusting what you're doing so we
start<00:04:16.400> general<00:04:17.120> and<00:04:17.359> then<00:04:17.479> we<00:04:17.659> move<00:04:17.930> towards

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
start general and then we move towards

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.310 
start general and then we move towards
the<00:04:18.949> specific<00:04:19.579> we're<00:04:19.760> still<00:04:20.029> in<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.320> fairly

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
the specific we're still in that fairly

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.640 
the specific we're still in that fairly
general<00:04:21.799> stage

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:23.650 
general stage

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:26.730 
general stage
and<00:04:23.740> if<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:24.669> want<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:25.060> I<00:04:25.090> can<00:04:25.510> go<00:04:25.720> ahead<00:04:26.199> and

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
and if I want to I can go ahead and

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.150 
and if I want to I can go ahead and
create<00:04:27.070> a<00:04:27.130> new<00:04:27.280> layer<00:04:28.110> and<00:04:29.110> in<00:04:29.320> this<00:04:29.470> layer<00:04:29.740> I'm

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
create a new layer and in this layer I'm

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.180 
create a new layer and in this layer I'm
going<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.520> take<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:31.090> airbrush<00:04:31.960> tool<00:04:32.860> and<00:04:33.130> I'm

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
going to take the airbrush tool and I'm

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.379 
going to take the airbrush tool and I'm
going<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.400> take<00:04:33.660> pepper-spray<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:35.470> I<00:04:35.800> will

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:36.389 
going to take pepper-spray and so I will

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:40.200 
going to take pepper-spray and so I will
drop<00:04:37.389> this<00:04:37.660> value<00:04:38.139> down<00:04:38.290> to<00:04:38.500> about<00:04:38.680> 50%<00:04:39.250> also

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
drop this value down to about 50% also

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:48.240 
drop this value down to about 50% also
and<00:04:41.050> we'll<00:04:41.410> grab<00:04:41.650> a<00:04:44.520> light<00:04:45.520> here<00:04:46.030> and<00:04:47.070> I'm<00:04:48.070> just

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
and we'll grab a light here and I'm just

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:53.219 
and we'll grab a light here and I'm just
going<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.430> create<00:04:49.060> this<00:04:50.550> light<00:04:51.750> peppery

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
going to create this light peppery

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:58.500 
going to create this light peppery
spray<00:04:53.740> here<00:04:54.400> a<00:04:54.699> little<00:04:55.419> bit<00:04:55.630> dark<00:04:56.970> and<00:04:57.970> as<00:04:58.389> you

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
spray here a little bit dark and as you

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.620 
spray here a little bit dark and as you
can<00:04:58.660> see<00:04:58.870> I'm<00:04:59.110> overspray<00:05:00.040> and<00:05:00.400> then<00:05:01.240> again<00:05:01.510> if

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
can see I'm overspray and then again if

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:07.969 
can see I'm overspray and then again if
I<00:05:01.750> set<00:05:02.050> this<00:05:02.229> to<00:05:03.240> overlay<00:05:04.620> it<00:05:05.620> just<00:05:06.070> adheres<00:05:06.639> to

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:07.979 
I set this to overlay it just adheres to

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:11.370 
I set this to overlay it just adheres to
the<00:05:08.979> value<00:05:09.669> that's<00:05:09.850> underneath<00:05:10.380> there's

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
the value that's underneath there's

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.020 
the value that's underneath there's
spray<00:05:11.889> just<00:05:12.100> a<00:05:12.280> little<00:05:12.490> bit<00:05:12.610> more<00:05:12.790> and<00:05:12.940> then

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
spray just a little bit more and then

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.230 
spray just a little bit more and then
I'm<00:05:13.120> going<00:05:13.240> to<00:05:13.330> back<00:05:13.630> this<00:05:13.900> about<00:05:14.229> this<00:05:15.240> way

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:16.240 
I'm going to back this about this way

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.840 
I'm going to back this about this way
down<00:05:16.750> because<00:05:17.050> it<00:05:17.139> just<00:05:17.500> want<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:17.950> little<00:05:18.310> bit

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
down because it just want a little bit

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.620 
down because it just want a little bit
of<00:05:19.800> texture<00:05:20.800> on<00:05:21.130> there<00:05:21.520> so<00:05:22.240> a<00:05:22.690> little<00:05:23.320> bit<00:05:23.590> more

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
of texture on there so a little bit more

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.350 
of texture on there so a little bit more
like<00:05:25.630> to<00:05:25.840> be<00:05:27.720> so<00:05:28.740> contrasting<00:05:29.740> and<00:05:30.180> then<00:05:31.180> in

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
like to be so contrasting and then in

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.469 
like to be so contrasting and then in
this<00:05:31.570> layer<00:05:32.440> I'm<00:05:32.590> going<00:05:32.740> to<00:05:32.800> go<00:05:32.889> back<00:05:33.160> to<00:05:33.479> the

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
this layer I'm going to go back to the

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:36.120 
this layer I'm going to go back to the
layer<00:05:34.660> underneath<00:05:35.169> and<00:05:35.560> then<00:05:35.680> this<00:05:35.830> one<00:05:36.010> just

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
layer underneath and then this one just

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.210 
layer underneath and then this one just
allows<00:05:36.520> me<00:05:36.550> to<00:05:37.090> play<00:05:37.510> with<00:05:37.539> the<00:05:38.080> contrast<00:05:38.889> just

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
allows me to play with the contrast just

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.740 
allows me to play with the contrast just
a<00:05:39.310> little<00:05:39.550> bit<00:05:39.669> more<00:05:39.880> that's<00:05:40.120> why<00:05:40.240> I<00:05:40.300> started

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
a little bit more that's why I started

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:50.040 
a little bit more that's why I started
the<00:05:41.460> 50%<00:05:44.550> opacity<00:05:48.150> boosted<00:05:49.150> up<00:05:49.270> to<00:05:49.419> about<00:05:49.570> 60%

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050 
the 50% opacity boosted up to about 60%

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.450 
the 50% opacity boosted up to about 60%
so<00:05:50.530> that's<00:05:50.710> one<00:05:51.130> way<00:05:51.340> to<00:05:51.370> start<00:05:52.180> developing

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
so that's one way to start developing

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.040 
so that's one way to start developing
some<00:05:54.460> of<00:05:54.490> the<00:05:54.610> foliage<00:05:54.820> obviously<00:05:55.720> this<00:05:55.870> is

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.050 
some of the foliage obviously this is

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:59.250 
some of the foliage obviously this is
these<00:05:57.039> are<00:05:57.099> short<00:05:57.430> videos<00:05:57.820> so<00:05:58.270> just<00:05:58.510> a<00:05:59.050> few

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
these are short videos so just a few

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.020 
these are short videos so just a few
minutes<00:05:59.530> in<00:05:59.680> to<00:05:59.860> start<00:06:00.130> getting<00:06:00.370> texture<00:06:00.940> and

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
minutes in to start getting texture and

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.339 
minutes in to start getting texture and
then<00:06:01.090> you<00:06:01.150> would<00:06:01.330> start<00:06:01.570> to<00:06:01.690> clean<00:06:01.930> it<00:06:02.139> up<00:06:02.229> with

00:06:02.339 --> 00:06:02.349 
then you would start to clean it up with

00:06:02.349 --> 00:06:04.320 
then you would start to clean it up with
a<00:06:02.410> number<00:06:02.590> of<00:06:02.770> different<00:06:03.099> techniques<00:06:03.490> I<00:06:03.760> mean

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
a number of different techniques I mean

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:08.070 
a number of different techniques I mean
if<00:06:04.419> I<00:06:04.539> if<00:06:05.200> I<00:06:05.500> go<00:06:05.710> in<00:06:05.889> real<00:06:06.250> quick<00:06:06.550> if<00:06:06.760> I<00:06:07.020> go<00:06:08.020> to

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
if I if I go in real quick if I go to

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.190 
if I if I go in real quick if I go to
the<00:06:08.500> water<00:06:08.860> rape<00:06:09.490> brush<00:06:09.910> get<00:06:10.750> a<00:06:10.780> little<00:06:11.050> bit

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
the water rape brush get a little bit

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:15.570 
the water rape brush get a little bit
smaller<00:06:11.740> I<00:06:12.039> could<00:06:12.460> start<00:06:12.729> to<00:06:12.910> blend<00:06:14.400> some<00:06:15.400> of

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
smaller I could start to blend some of

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.460 
smaller I could start to blend some of
these<00:06:15.729> values<00:06:16.599> like<00:06:17.380> so<00:06:17.919> and<00:06:18.250> just<00:06:18.310> kind<00:06:18.910> of

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
these values like so and just kind of

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:25.860 
these values like so and just kind of
move<00:06:20.470> around<00:06:22.740> with<00:06:23.740> them<00:06:23.889> so<00:06:24.490> they're<00:06:24.700> not<00:06:24.880> so

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:25.870 
move around with them so they're not so

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.010 
move around with them so they're not so
uniform<00:06:26.349> as<00:06:26.800> far<00:06:26.979> as<00:06:27.099> the<00:06:28.020> impressionist

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
uniform as far as the impressionist

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.940 
uniform as far as the impressionist
brush<00:06:29.260> goes<00:06:30.419> and<00:06:31.419> there<00:06:32.080> you<00:06:32.289> have<00:06:32.469> it<00:06:32.650> so<00:06:32.800> this

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:32.950 
brush goes and there you have it so this

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:36.780 
brush goes and there you have it so this
is<00:06:33.070> the<00:06:33.190> start<00:06:33.640> of<00:06:33.849> the<00:06:34.860> creating<00:06:35.860> a

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.790 
is the start of the creating a

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:41.290 
is the start of the creating a
foolish<00:06:37.790> for<00:06:38.360> your<00:06:39.190> future<00:06:40.190> thanks<00:06:40.699> again<00:06:40.910> for

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
foolish for your future thanks again for
