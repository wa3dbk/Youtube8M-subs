00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:05.420
 here is a presentation of the circle the beating 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.870
 It's a singer 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.870
 two cents to w 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:14.740
 the bmw why louis perron 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.099
 that is to say, while being given that it contains 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:20.150
 hide it 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.409
 in his sentence 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:24.259
 swimming pool 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:25.390
 behind 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.390
 the new crisis 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:30.560
 he aims 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.220
 protective plastic some say it was folded and then cover 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.380
 the whole circle 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:38.570
 in any case bad weather 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.910
 two of these heat pills eventually 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.030
 and especially 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.510
 to protect him from support 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.410
 it's a fifth who carry shoulder 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.010
 crossed 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.700
 across the globe 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.190
 it's particular 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.130
 the t5 for them is a singer 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.480
 and who inscribes 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 all its originality 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.690
 so it's through a specifically radio bag but a fifth in the front 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.940
 veolia comes the barrel is still across 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.039
 which makes some say that there is more comfortable 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:17.640
 either because it's very good it's for women who have a chest and 

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:20.290
 which can hinder his transport 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:24.740
 they are more so the idea that once he's on the com he goes 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.740
 power 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.410
 past of the tour 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.510
 we find 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.900
 he thus presented 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.670
 the user 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.930
 it turns out that 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:40.350
 a place where tomorrow 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.030
 I find it good 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.560
 presented to the user 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.090
 his side pocket 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.090
 which can open 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.910
 and give access immediately 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.840
 to the case without needing in the bags simply by rotating it 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.480
 across 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.460
 and then 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.460
 access the device in one ream 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.129
 right here 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.199
