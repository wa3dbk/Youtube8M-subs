00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.610 
and that's it to begin I laid my fabric
out<00:01:50.800> on<00:01:51.100> a<00:01:51.159> flat<00:01:51.580> surface<00:01:51.970> and<00:01:52.540> using<00:01:53.470> my

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
out on a flat surface and using my

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.860 
out on a flat surface and using my
scissors<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.100> one<00:01:54.790> of<00:01:54.909> the<00:01:55.060> stripes<00:01:55.390> from<00:01:55.750> the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
scissors and one of the stripes from the

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.960 
scissors and one of the stripes from the
flannel<00:01:56.229> pattern<00:01:56.650> as<00:01:56.860> a<00:01:56.920> guide<00:01:57.100> I<00:01:57.550> cut<00:01:57.940> a

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
flannel pattern as a guide I cut a

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.000 
flannel pattern as a guide I cut a
straight<00:01:58.390> edge<00:01:58.630> and<00:01:58.960> this<00:01:59.140> step<00:01:59.320> is<00:01:59.470> important

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:00.010 
straight edge and this step is important

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.950 
straight edge and this step is important
because<00:02:00.220> if<00:02:00.580> your<00:02:01.120> edge<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:01.390> not<00:02:01.540> completely

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
because if your edge is not completely

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.750 
because if your edge is not completely
straight<00:02:02.260> when<00:02:02.560> you<00:02:02.650> fringe<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.100> it<00:02:03.310> will<00:02:03.580> will

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
straight when you fringe it it will will

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.270 
straight when you fringe it it will will
be<00:02:03.940> very<00:02:04.240> difficult<00:02:04.479> so<00:02:05.440> then<00:02:05.620> I'm<00:02:05.860> taking<00:02:06.070> my

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
be very difficult so then I'm taking my

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.020 
be very difficult so then I'm taking my
tweezer<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:07.090> I'm<00:02:07.840> just<00:02:08.349> pulling<00:02:09.190> out<00:02:09.340> threads

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
tweezer and I'm just pulling out threads

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.210 
tweezer and I'm just pulling out threads
one<00:02:10.750> by<00:02:10.929> one<00:02:11.200> but<00:02:11.470> once<00:02:11.620> you<00:02:11.739> get<00:02:11.830> further<00:02:12.099> up

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
one by one but once you get further up

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.330 
one by one but once you get further up
you<00:02:12.370> can<00:02:12.760> pull<00:02:13.120> multiple<00:02:13.330> at<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.720> time<00:02:14.340> this

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
you can pull multiple at a time this

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.460 
you can pull multiple at a time this
process<00:02:16.120> can<00:02:16.330> be<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.510> little<00:02:16.569> bit<00:02:16.930> tedious<00:02:17.200> but

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
process can be a little bit tedious but

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.059 
process can be a little bit tedious but
the<00:02:18.250> results<00:02:18.730> are<00:02:18.879> beautiful<00:02:19.840> so<00:02:19.870> I<00:02:20.170> continued

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
the results are beautiful so I continued

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.900 
the results are beautiful so I continued
this<00:02:21.250> process<00:02:21.730> until<00:02:21.970> I<00:02:22.180> had<00:02:22.420> about

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
this process until I had about

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:25.840 
this process until I had about
centimeter<00:02:23.360> in<00:02:23.630> length<00:02:23.660> of<00:02:24.200> Fringe<00:02:24.590> and<00:02:24.830> I<00:02:25.670> did

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
centimeter in length of Fringe and I did

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.550 
centimeter in length of Fringe and I did
this<00:02:26.000> all<00:02:26.240> the<00:02:26.510> way<00:02:26.600> around<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.080> all<00:02:27.200> four

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
this all the way around to all four

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:50.240 
this all the way around to all four
edges

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.130 

when<00:02:51.250> you're<00:02:51.400> all<00:02:51.549> done<00:02:51.790> you'll<00:02:52.060> have<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.540> large

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
when you're all done you'll have a large

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.170 
when you're all done you'll have a large
pile<00:02:53.440> of<00:02:53.650> thread<00:02:53.980> but<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.400> beautiful<00:02:54.909> looking

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180

jacket because it's just so warm and

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:24.210 
jacket because it's just so warm and
then<00:03:22.599> at<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.019> restaurant<00:03:23.440> but<00:03:23.859> you're<00:03:23.980> kind

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
then at the restaurant but you're kind

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.220 
then at the restaurant but you're kind
of<00:03:24.340> sitting<00:03:24.640> like<00:03:24.910> not<00:03:25.420> super<00:03:25.780> close<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:26.109> the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
of sitting like not super close to the

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.539 
of sitting like not super close to the
door<00:03:26.379> but<00:03:26.560> there<00:03:26.709> was<00:03:26.829> definitely<00:03:26.859> a<00:03:27.250> draft

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
door but there was definitely a draft

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.580 
door but there was definitely a draft
coming<00:03:27.940> in<00:03:28.030> from<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.390> door<00:03:28.599> so<00:03:28.870> I<00:03:28.900> put<00:03:29.200> this<00:03:29.349> on

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
coming in from the door so I put this on

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.710 
coming in from the door so I put this on
my<00:03:30.129> legs<00:03:30.459> and<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.940> just<00:03:31.120> kept<00:03:31.299> me<00:03:31.390> so<00:03:31.599> much

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
my legs and it just kept me so much

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.270 
my legs and it just kept me so much
warmer<00:03:32.049> because<00:03:32.230> I<00:03:32.319> was<00:03:32.440> wearing<00:03:32.650> a<00:03:32.709> skirt<00:03:32.980> so

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280 
warmer because I was wearing a skirt so

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.890 
warmer because I was wearing a skirt so
just<00:03:33.790> simple<00:03:34.030> ways<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.390> you<00:03:34.450> can<00:03:34.629> use<00:03:34.750> this

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900 
just simple ways that you can use this

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.199 
just simple ways that you can use this
really<00:03:35.200> F<00:03:35.319> blanket<00:03:35.920> but<00:03:36.310> it's<00:03:36.579> a<00:03:36.700> stark<00:03:36.970> so

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
really F blanket but it's a stark so

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.180 
really F blanket but it's a stark so
it's<00:03:37.810> really<00:03:37.989> versatile<00:03:38.500> and<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:38.890> lot<00:03:39.069> of

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
it's really versatile and a lot of

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.740 
it's really versatile and a lot of
people<00:03:39.430> say<00:03:39.609> that<00:03:39.640> these<00:03:40.299> stars<00:03:40.540> are<00:03:40.690> really

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
people say that these stars are really

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.210 
people say that these stars are really
great<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.079> travel<00:03:41.260> with<00:03:41.440> I<00:03:41.650> don't<00:03:41.709> do<00:03:41.920> too<00:03:42.099> much

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
great to travel with I don't do too much

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.039 
great to travel with I don't do too much
traveling<00:03:42.790> but<00:03:43.060> I'm<00:03:43.269> sure<00:03:43.510> this<00:03:43.720> would<00:03:43.870> be

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
traveling but I'm sure this would be

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.199 
traveling but I'm sure this would be
really<00:03:44.859> useful<00:03:44.890> because<00:03:45.340> you<00:03:45.489> can<00:03:45.760> use<00:03:46.180> it

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
really useful because you can use it

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.300 
really useful because you can use it
