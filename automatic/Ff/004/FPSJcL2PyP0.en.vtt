00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
looks like that one was stuck to this

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.830 
looks like that one was stuck to this
one<00:00:28.349> because<00:00:29.340> you<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.490> see<00:00:29.849> some<00:00:30.119> rust<00:00:30.449> there

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
one because you can see some rust there

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.209 
one because you can see some rust there

and rust on that side so those two are

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:36.650 
and rust on that side so those two are
probably<00:00:35.460> stuck<00:00:35.969> together
