hey everyone so today miss you could mix
a<00:00:02.070> tank<00:00:02.310> and<00:00:02.520> it<00:00:02.700> looks<00:00:02.850> like<00:00:02.939> this<00:00:03.300> you<00:00:04.259> you

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
a tank and it looks like this you you

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.120 
a tank and it looks like this you you
can<00:00:05.160> use<00:00:05.339> on<00:00:05.640> uni<00:00:06.480> elastic<00:00:07.109> beads<00:00:07.680> and

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
can use on uni elastic beads and

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.480 
can use on uni elastic beads and
scissors<00:00:09.000> so<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:10.410> cut<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.889> piece<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.160> elastic

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
scissors so you cut a piece of elastic

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.169 
scissors so you cut a piece of elastic
40<00:00:12.360> inches<00:00:12.690> and<00:00:12.929> use<00:00:13.650> thicker<00:00:14.250> elastic<00:00:14.940> like

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
40 inches and use thicker elastic like

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.029 
40 inches and use thicker elastic like
at<00:00:15.420> least<00:00:15.570> point<00:00:15.900> seven<00:00:16.260> but<00:00:16.500> if<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:16.830> don't

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
at least point seven but if you don't

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.429 
at least point seven but if you don't
have<00:00:17.279> point<00:00:17.670> seven<00:00:18.000> if<00:00:18.210> you<00:00:18.449> use<00:00:18.750> point<00:00:19.140> five

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
have point seven if you use point five

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:26.420 
have point seven if you use point five
or<00:00:20.010> i'm<00:00:20.520> using<00:00:20.880> point<00:00:21.210> one<00:00:22.010> but<00:00:23.010> um<00:00:25.310> it's<00:00:26.310> like

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
or i'm using point one but um it's like

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.359 
or i'm using point one but um it's like
little<00:00:26.849> segments<00:00:27.480> now<00:00:28.380> my<00:00:28.619> using<00:00:28.920> plan<00:00:29.279> i'm

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
little segments now my using plan i'm

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.820 
little segments now my using plan i'm
using<00:00:29.670> one<00:00:29.849> millimeter<00:00:30.300> so<00:00:30.929> it's<00:00:31.109> thick<00:00:31.529> and

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
using one millimeter so it's thick and

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.440 
using one millimeter so it's thick and
it's<00:00:32.130> tight<00:00:32.899> so<00:00:34.100> you'll<00:00:35.100> need<00:00:35.250> i<00:00:35.550> use<00:00:35.880> 6db

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
it's tight so you'll need i use 6db

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.220 
it's tight so you'll need i use 6db
treatise<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:38.040> at<00:00:38.399> least<00:00:38.670> 60<00:00:39.149> beads<00:00:39.420> and<00:00:39.780> then

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
treatise so at least 60 beads and then

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.310 
treatise so at least 60 beads and then
you'll<00:00:41.100> need<00:00:41.280> like<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> color<00:00:42.270> pair<00:00:43.020> like<00:00:43.200> this

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
you'll need like a color pair like this

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.279 
you'll need like a color pair like this
inside<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.399> then<00:00:44.700> an<00:00:45.000> outside<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.840> used<00:00:46.020> to

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
inside and then an outside I used to

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.350 
inside and then an outside I used to
pray<00:00:46.950> this<00:00:47.100> one<00:00:47.340> but<00:00:47.850> i'm<00:00:47.910> just<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.239> to<00:00:48.270> use

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
pray this one but i'm just going to use

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.709 
pray this one but i'm just going to use
one<00:00:48.660> so<00:00:49.020> gray<00:00:49.620> is<00:00:49.860> my<00:00:49.980> inside<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.579> yellow<00:00:51.449> is

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
one so gray is my inside and yellow is

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.529 
one so gray is my inside and yellow is
my<00:00:51.750> out<00:00:52.340> so<00:00:53.340> we<00:00:53.640> should<00:00:53.820> use<00:00:53.910> cut<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> piece<00:00:54.480> of

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
my out so we should use cut a piece of

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.340 
my out so we should use cut a piece of
elastic<00:00:54.989> 40<00:00:55.680> inches<00:00:56.100> add<00:00:56.399> on<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.390> gray<00:00:57.719> bean<00:00:57.960> he

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
elastic 40 inches add on a gray bean he

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.979 
elastic 40 inches add on a gray bean he
ran<00:00:58.770> outside<00:00:58.949> bead<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.609> then<00:01:00.890> two<00:01:01.890> of<00:01:02.989> your

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
ran outside bead and then two of your

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.780 
ran outside bead and then two of your
inside<00:01:04.470> beat<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.129> yellow<00:01:06.470> whoops<00:01:07.520> but<00:01:08.520> just

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
inside beat so yellow whoops but just

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:17.690 
inside beat so yellow whoops but just
like<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:09.299> great<00:01:09.900> b<00:01:10.020> phila<00:01:12.740> ok<00:01:15.439> so<00:01:16.439> now<00:01:16.619> this<00:01:17.070> will

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
like a great b phila ok so now this will

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.260 
like a great b phila ok so now this will
definitely<00:01:18.240> get<00:01:18.950> confusing<00:01:19.970> so<00:01:20.970> i'm<00:01:21.060> going<00:01:21.150> to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
definitely get confusing so i'm going to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.880 
definitely get confusing so i'm going to
zoom<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:23.280> then<00:01:24.140> which<00:01:25.140> you<00:01:25.500> just<00:01:25.680> leave<00:01:25.860> a

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
zoom in and then which you just leave a

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.600 
zoom in and then which you just leave a
little<00:01:25.950> at<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.369> end<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.939> you<00:01:27.180> could<00:01:27.330> I<00:01:28.549> leave<00:01:29.549> a

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
little at the end so you could I leave a

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.310 
little at the end so you could I leave a
little<00:01:29.700> strength<00:01:30.180> end<00:01:30.500> so<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:32.189> have<00:01:32.460> your

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
little strength end so you have your

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.649 
little strength end so you have your
gray<00:01:34.320> or<00:01:34.680> whatever<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.280> on<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.640> left<00:01:35.850> then

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
gray or whatever it on the left then

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.450 
gray or whatever it on the left then
your<00:01:36.840> 2<00:01:36.960> b's<00:01:37.110> on<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.380> right<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:38.009> take<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
your 2 b's on the right you take the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.219 
your 2 b's on the right you take the
string<00:01:38.820> mine's<00:01:39.479> coming<00:01:39.750> out<00:01:39.960> through<00:01:40.079> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
string mine's coming out through the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.630 
string mine's coming out through the
right<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.860> i'm<00:01:40.979> just<00:01:41.040> going<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.340> show<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.520> that

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
right so i'm just going to show you that

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.410 
right so i'm just going to show you that
it<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.689> way<00:01:42.869> then<00:01:43.310> thread<00:01:44.310> through<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:45.390> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
it that way then thread through like the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.170 
it that way then thread through like the
way<00:01:45.840> you're<00:01:46.439> outside<00:01:47.009> beads<00:01:47.280> are<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:48.030> I'm

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
way you're outside beads are so I'm

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.100 
way you're outside beads are so I'm
threading<00:01:48.509> through<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:49.350> right<00:01:51.350> like<00:01:52.350> that

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
threading through the right like that

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.630 
threading through the right like that
like<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.259> learned<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.649> from<00:01:55.770> ginger<00:01:56.219> candy

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
like I learned this from ginger candy

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.060 
like I learned this from ginger candy
and<00:01:56.790> can't<00:01:57.030> really<00:01:57.119> show<00:01:57.540> how<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.869> do<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.469> so<00:01:58.680> i

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and can't really show how to do it so i

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.719 
and can't really show how to do it so i
got<00:01:59.310> confused<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.320> just<00:02:01.770> kind<00:02:02.100> of<00:02:02.250> made<00:02:02.610> up

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
got confused and I just kind of made up

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.370 
got confused and I just kind of made up
my<00:02:02.880> own<00:02:02.909> light<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.570> worked<00:02:03.780> out<00:02:03.930> exactly

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
my own light and it worked out exactly

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.300 
my own light and it worked out exactly
the<00:02:04.590> same<00:02:04.880> then<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.000> add<00:02:06.180> on<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:07.229> more<00:02:07.950> beads

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the same then you add on to more beads

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.450 
the same then you add on to more beads
of<00:02:08.640> your<00:02:09.270> outside

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
of your outside

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.180 
of your outside
and<00:02:11.550> then<00:02:11.790> see<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:13.050> way<00:02:13.230> your<00:02:13.470> string<00:02:13.770> already

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
and then see the way your string already

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.680 
and then see the way your string already
is<00:02:15.020> you<00:02:16.020> just<00:02:16.290> thread<00:02:16.800> through<00:02:17.190> like<00:02:18.090> it's

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
is you just thread through like it's

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.360 
is you just thread through like it's
coming<00:02:18.990> at<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:19.170> right<00:02:19.380> so<00:02:19.680> I'm<00:02:19.980> just<00:02:20.130> going<00:02:20.310> to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
coming at the right so I'm just going to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.610 
coming at the right so I'm just going to
go<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.450> left<00:02:21.720> side<00:02:22.080> and<00:02:22.350> thread<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:24.180> way

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
go to the left side and thread this way

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:32.600 
go to the left side and thread this way
through<00:02:25.620> the<00:02:25.770> bead<00:02:25.980> to<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.490> right<00:02:29.840> and<00:02:31.610> pull

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
through the bead to the right and pull

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.390 
through the bead to the right and pull
tight<00:02:33.350> and<00:02:35.210> there<00:02:36.210> that's<00:02:36.720> like<00:02:37.110> just<00:02:38.100> kind<00:02:38.370> of

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
tight and there that's like just kind of

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.190 
tight and there that's like just kind of
push<00:02:38.610> it<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:38.910> that<00:02:39.120> so<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:39.540> like<00:02:39.660> it<00:02:39.780> looks

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
push it like that so it's like it looks

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.890 
push it like that so it's like it looks
like<00:02:40.410> an<00:02:40.530> X<00:02:40.770> and<00:02:41.550> I'm<00:02:41.820> going<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.060> turn<00:02:42.630> it

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
like an X and I'm going to turn it

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.780 
like an X and I'm going to turn it
around<00:02:43.820> cuz<00:02:44.820> yeah<00:02:45.750> I<00:02:45.930> like<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.380> they<00:02:47.040> sing<00:02:47.370> like

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
around cuz yeah I like it they sing like

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.940 
around cuz yeah I like it they sing like
the<00:02:47.820> left<00:02:48.300> cuz<00:02:48.780> imma<00:02:49.110> lefty<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.590> it's<00:02:49.770> just

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
the left cuz imma lefty and it's just

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.340 
the left cuz imma lefty and it's just
easier<00:02:50.370> for<00:02:50.430> me<00:02:50.610> that<00:02:50.730> way<00:02:50.960> so<00:02:51.960> that's<00:02:52.110> how<00:02:52.200> you

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
easier for me that way so that's how you

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.400 
easier for me that way so that's how you
do<00:02:52.560> with<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.830> right<00:02:53.160> like<00:02:53.750> right<00:02:54.750> side<00:02:55.050> and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
do with the right like right side and

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.120 
do with the right like right side and
that<00:02:56.220> is<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.670> correct<00:02:56.910> way<00:02:57.210> also<00:02:57.860> so<00:02:58.860> then<00:02:59.010> you

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
that is the correct way also so then you

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:03.380 
that is the correct way also so then you
pull<00:02:59.640> like<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.620> then<00:03:02.130> this<00:03:02.790> part<00:03:03.090> might

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
pull like that and then this part might

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.830 
pull like that and then this part might
seem<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.440> little<00:03:04.650> confusing<00:03:05.190> also<00:03:05.880> but<00:03:06.810> you

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
seem a little confusing also but you

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.180 
seem a little confusing also but you
thread<00:03:07.290> on<00:03:09.170> another<00:03:10.170> middle<00:03:10.710> bead<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
thread on another middle bead of the

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.940 
thread on another middle bead of the
same<00:03:11.490> color<00:03:11.760> but<00:03:12.030> keep<00:03:12.600> it<00:03:12.750> close<00:03:13.170> and<00:03:13.590> then

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950 
same color but keep it close and then

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.460 
same color but keep it close and then
there<00:03:16.950> I'm<00:03:17.070> you're<00:03:17.280> outside<00:03:17.670> beads<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.750> yellow

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
there I'm you're outside beads so yellow

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.000 
there I'm you're outside beads so yellow
and<00:03:19.980> then<00:03:20.790> just<00:03:21.270> hold<00:03:22.110> those<00:03:22.410> two<00:03:22.740> beads

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
and then just hold those two beads

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:24.920 
and then just hold those two beads
together<00:03:23.370> because<00:03:24.150> you<00:03:24.180> want<00:03:24.510> these<00:03:24.690> to<00:03:24.900> be

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
together because you want these to be

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.160 
together because you want these to be
close<00:03:25.440> and<00:03:25.770> you're<00:03:26.520> gonna<00:03:26.610> thread<00:03:27.090> through<00:03:27.480> so

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
close and you're gonna thread through so

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.840 
close and you're gonna thread through so
i<00:03:28.200> have<00:03:28.740> my<00:03:28.890> shrink<00:03:29.190> coming<00:03:29.490> out<00:03:29.580> through<00:03:29.700> the

i have my shrink coming out through the

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.380 
i have my shrink coming out through the
left<00:03:30.060> then<00:03:30.750> I'm<00:03:30.930> just<00:03:31.050> gonna<00:03:31.230> thread<00:03:31.740> like

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
like that so that's like an easier way

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.030 
like that so that's like an easier way
to<00:03:47.160> remember<00:03:47.930> it's<00:03:48.930> like<00:03:49.110> you're<00:03:49.830> always

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
going driving in the direction that

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.150 
going driving in the direction that
you're<00:03:53.730> making<00:03:53.940> your<00:03:54.330> bracelet<00:03:54.870> so<00:03:55.680> then<00:03:55.860> add

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
you're making your bracelet so then add

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.380 
you're making your bracelet so then add
on<00:03:57.410> two<00:03:58.410> beads<00:03:58.770> and<00:03:59.190> then<00:03:59.310> since<00:03:59.730> my<00:04:00.090> Springs

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
on two beads and then since my Springs

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.600 
on two beads and then since my Springs
coming<00:04:00.630> out<00:04:00.840> through<00:04:00.930> the<00:04:01.080> left<00:04:01.320> I'm<00:04:02.250> going<00:04:02.520> to

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
coming out through the left I'm going to

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.510 
coming out through the left I'm going to
thread<00:04:03.090> through<00:04:03.590> like<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:04.980> right<00:04:05.160> side

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
thread through like on the right side

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.080 
thread through like on the right side
but<00:04:06.420> ends<00:04:06.960> up<00:04:07.020> going<00:04:07.260> towards<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.580> left<00:04:08.820> and

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
but ends up going towards the left and

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.540 
but ends up going towards the left and
just<00:04:09.360> try<00:04:09.810> and<00:04:09.870> keep<00:04:10.140> your<00:04:10.380> middle<00:04:11.370> beads

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:11.550 
just try and keep your middle beads

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.380 
just try and keep your middle beads
together<00:04:11.960> and<00:04:13.700> then<00:04:14.700> it's<00:04:16.100> oops

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
together and then it's oops

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.290 
together and then it's oops
and<00:04:19.390> it's<00:04:19.540> like<00:04:19.750> that<00:04:20.790> just<00:04:21.790> try<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.120> keep

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
and it's like that just try and keep

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.830 
and it's like that just try and keep
them<00:04:22.510> closed<00:04:23.250> so<00:04:24.250> they<00:04:24.400> don't<00:04:24.640> like<00:04:24.970> separate

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
them closed so they don't like separate

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.250 
them closed so they don't like separate
really<00:04:27.270> pull<00:04:28.270> tight<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:31.270> then<00:04:31.480> you've<00:04:31.960> got

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.260 
really pull tight so then you've got

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.860 
really pull tight so then you've got
this<00:04:33.540> like<00:04:34.540> it<00:04:34.960> looks<00:04:35.200> like<00:04:35.380> this<00:04:35.560> now

through the left of the beam to get that

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.640 
through the left of the beam to get that
and<00:05:33.430> then<00:05:33.700> again<00:05:34.260> adding<00:05:35.260> your<00:05:35.470> two<00:05:35.770> beats<00:05:37.650> and
