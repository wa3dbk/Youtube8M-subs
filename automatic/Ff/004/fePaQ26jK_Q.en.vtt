00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
 hello friends of the movie welcome to 

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.560
 dvd criticism my further trailer check 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.570
 and to a directv the 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.160
 release in the jean claude van 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.230
 damme in a movie with a very 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.370
 strange title and so on 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.220
 we would be in view of the German 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.640
 trailer from junglecamp welcome to the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.640
 jungle 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.050
 That's why we will build all without 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:33.430
 exception to a two-day team building 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:36.100
 siena was my name is tom tom rostek 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.390
 Here you will learn teamwork and if I am too 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.120
 We may be careful 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.560
 even fun 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.060
 you only have two ordinary stones 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.630
 between legs hangs the 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.630
 pilot a 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.960
 Welcome to the kingdom of nature 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.030
 it is right we have a business 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.030
 media 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.080
 and doing so much good when screwing 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.340
 I'll fly you out you can 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.340
 fly we are in the ass 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.780
 would 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.880
 but that's enough 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.260
 the probability that it 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:54.760
 just on this island 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:57.820
 dangerous animals are coming soon 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.590
 is that shit now or is the trash 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.030
 Maybe fans thrashers could do it completely 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.590
 funny would be the place where 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.540
 steam tiger is attacked sees it 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.920
 damned for trash because of that 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.110
 I really know if I strip here 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.970
 Now, brave good 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:11.800
 should because he just produced as a waste 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.510
 or if they are serious because then 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.640
 The trailer looks important but kaka 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.520
 Anyway, welcome to the 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.450
 jungle the and ascot elite 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:22.090
 expected from the 25th 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.010
 march 2014 in not the german cinemas 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.510
 but in the dvd blu ray shelves 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.620
 would bring in for you as always in the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.780
 Video description will tell the story 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.430
 Chris says he works in one 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.140
 Agency but his job does not work that way 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.040
 right one of his colleagues steals him 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.900
 still the ideas 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.460
 He falls in love with a coworker 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.130
 as works but not really the 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.050
 love around chris life is just running 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.370
 pretty bad and as the boss of the 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:44.110
 agency still on the idea comes one 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.880
 to do team building action namely 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.440
 on the tropical island to fly around 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.209
 There all in the small little more 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.040
 to weld this post together 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.810
 whole but led by an ex marine 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.640
 Live played by Jean Claude 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.530
 ladies then it's kind of chaos 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.480
 perfect because chris is anything but 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.150
 a tough guy and explore this 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.530
 she looks pretty angry and somehow has 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.850
 then just this trailer together 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.500
 and those strange titles in that one 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:07.030
 please do not think jungle camp 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.690
 title why do you have to pull on this train 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.550
 jump up 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.200
 at this point and there you stay 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.150
 Just go back with a puzzled face 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.560
 wonders this is really kag now 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.820
 or will that be properly shit on purpose 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.670
 accordingly, no idea at all 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.290
 whether the film like me with the now 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.400
 which experience I should go there 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.870
 but i will definitely do that 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.550
 because I'm looking for trashfilm or 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.260
 Trash movie fan am and I'm curious 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.090
 what you have to say about the matter you have 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.560
 exactly 90 minutes the film goes what 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.480
 any such sign is that one 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.790
 just trying so happy and one 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.440
 normal running length to press in and 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:37.660
 ask me again can then upgrade 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.250
 but some criticisms the film 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.480
 have already pointed out 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:42.610
 that the film may be more than 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:44.350
 now the cover suggests somehow 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.670
 and with that I am with a lot of tension 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.160
 finished with my short little one 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.050
 maybe different trailer check 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.580
 to have a different movie that 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.780
 like to thumb the world that would let it 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.100
 Remember when I otherwise there yet 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.650

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.760
