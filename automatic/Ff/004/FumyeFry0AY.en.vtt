00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.440
 I am satisfied counters 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.280
 i'll get into the closest training to get too many insights 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.080
 that would be really in the area of â€‹â€‹SEM 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.300
 which is usually fun only 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.000
 most exciting for me 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 could realize his own child 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.960
 Mon Westrup for example new tract DC for Frank automatons or one multiplies 3 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.060
 4 and 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 or you will see and when banking with 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.300
 We are also allowed to participate in major projects right from the start 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.300
 and he already enjoys it 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.140
 I'm curious 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.880
 I constantly have to discover something new that users like in the little Miranda 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.880
 Build everything up and watch how it works 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.909
 it is certainly not our network 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.850
 CAD too big a operation as the situation is quite normal 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.480
 understand which systems are linked like 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.400
 you have to imagine its terabytes in what information the 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.640
 The banks need the operators to store it over 15 years 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.060
 and that these data are not lost and permanently ready for it 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.020
 we take care of each other 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.270
 open is still open when is the most important 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.020
 you knew every day any other topics now it is not like that 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:10.699
 one now 

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:13.789
 permanently in the same job and then someday says that is quite 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.789
 nice boring 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:20.259
 the limits 

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:24.229
 I also had his branch computer science on the west side in school 

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:25.639
 do 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:28.639
 the connections drove a partner very well 

00:02:30.039 --> 00:02:33.099
 the most exciting were doctors my education offered them 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.709
 location factor 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.989
 In other companies, it may be that you just put a department 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:42.379
 and stay there for three years and here you can 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.379
 that was exactly what Ahlen knew 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:51.949
 in computer science, there is no turn easy business is the main reason 

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:55.009
 merged eg Sindel 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:57.939
 You can do a lot with it later 

00:02:57.939 --> 00:02:59.239
 and around 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.999
 No, mean 

00:03:00.999 --> 00:03:03.999
 it has good future prospects 

00:03:06.609 --> 00:03:10.409
 in the area honored ones circumvented more aptly and I do not have it until today 

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:13.090
 versatility 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.539
 it is probably the most beautiful 

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:19.819
 Persian disappears work Russell approaches 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.649
 but one on 

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:24.649
 but he does not break 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:32.819
 with the shoulder 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:33.889
 until the 7th 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.889
 and then Lehmann and enter 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.879
 the donor of it a department 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.120
 among others, they have complained to them 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.829
 help and promote with image 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:59.229
 soulful and enormous 

00:03:59.229 --> 00:03:59.909
 King injured
