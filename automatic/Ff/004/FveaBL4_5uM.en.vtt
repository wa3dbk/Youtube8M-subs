into<00:05:53.380> the<00:05:53.500> hot<00:05:53.740> liquid<00:05:53.950> because<00:05:54.430> it<00:05:54.550> will

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
into the hot liquid because it will

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.990 
into the hot liquid because it will
curdle<00:05:54.940> so<00:05:55.660> what<00:05:55.840> you<00:05:55.930> want<00:05:56.110> to<00:05:56.200> do<00:05:56.380> is<00:05:57.280> you

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
curdle so what you want to do is you

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.340 
curdle so what you want to do is you
want<00:05:58.210> to<00:05:58.300> take<00:05:58.510> a<00:05:59.820> ladles<00:06:00.820> worth<00:06:01.060> of<00:06:01.360> the<00:06:02.110> broth

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:09.030 
and slowly pour it in as you mix and

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:12.060 
and slowly pour it in as you mix and
what<00:06:10.030> this<00:06:10.210> does<00:06:10.510> is<00:06:10.840> it<00:06:11.410> brings<00:06:11.440> the

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
what this does is it brings the

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.490 
what this does is it brings the
temperature<00:06:12.550> of<00:06:12.760> the<00:06:13.330> eggs<00:06:13.479> up<00:06:13.780> and<00:06:14.169> I

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
temperature of the eggs up and I

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.590 
temperature of the eggs up and I
normally<00:06:14.890> will<00:06:15.100> do<00:06:15.250> it<00:06:15.370> twice<00:06:16.740> and<00:06:18.120> this<00:06:19.120> way

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
normally will do it twice and this way

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.830 
normally will do it twice and this way
the<00:06:19.900> eggs<00:06:20.080> aren't<00:06:20.430> cold<00:06:21.430> and<00:06:22.090> when<00:06:22.630> they're

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840 
the eggs aren't cold and when they're

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:24.930 
the eggs aren't cold and when they're
added<00:06:22.990> they<00:06:23.740> won't<00:06:23.950> curdle<00:06:24.160> so<00:06:24.700> we'll<00:06:24.820> go

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
added they won't curdle so we'll go

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:33.640 
added they won't curdle so we'll go
ahead<00:06:24.970> and<00:06:25.120> do<00:06:25.240> that<00:06:25.270> now

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:33.650

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
and as you see it should be like this

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:40.640 
and as you see it should be like this
nice<00:06:36.690> cream<00:06:37.229> color<00:06:37.699> if<00:06:38.699> your<00:06:39.090> eggs<00:06:39.270> do<00:06:39.539> curdle
