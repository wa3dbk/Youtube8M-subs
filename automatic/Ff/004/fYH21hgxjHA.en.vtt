00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
working on them and I could not for the

that<00:00:54.270> controls<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.730> mic<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:57.090> has<00:00:57.510> also<00:00:57.809> the

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
that controls the mic it has also the

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:01.910 
that controls the mic it has also the
volume<00:00:59.039> rocker<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.489> it<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.350> what<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.379> found<00:01:01.710> out

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
volume rocker on it and what I found out

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.820 
volume rocker on it and what I found out
was<00:01:02.160> what<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.579> kind<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.149> expected<00:01:03.780> they<00:01:04.589> use

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
was what I kind of expected they use

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.300 
was what I kind of expected they use
very<00:01:05.479> small<00:01:06.479> wires<00:01:07.140> in<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> actually

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
very small wires in this and actually

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.270 
very small wires in this and actually
I'll<00:01:08.460> show<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.820> it's<00:01:09.570> got<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:10.140> instead<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.189> the

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
I'll show you it's got a instead of the

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.429 
I'll show you it's got a instead of the
standard<00:01:11.610> round<00:01:12.180> cable<00:01:12.900> they<00:01:13.740> use<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.700> flat

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:15.439 
standard round cable they use this flat

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:18.320 
standard round cable they use this flat
cable<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.860> kind<00:01:17.070> of<00:01:17.159> help<00:01:17.369> with<00:01:17.640> rollovers

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
cable to kind of help with rollovers

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.160 
cable to kind of help with rollovers
from<00:01:18.810> your<00:01:19.110> your<00:01:20.100> chair<00:01:20.400> or<00:01:20.549> whatever<00:01:20.780> it<00:01:21.780> you

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
from your your chair or whatever it you

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.480 
from your your chair or whatever it you
know<00:01:22.259> they<00:01:22.380> try<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.799> think<00:01:22.950> about<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.310> gamer

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
know they try and think about the gamer

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.980 
know they try and think about the gamer
but<00:01:24.710> what<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:25.830> does<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.720> wires

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
but what that does is that the the wires

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.499 
but what that does is that the the wires
on<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.409> exterior<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.250> cable<00:01:29.670> actually

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
on the exterior of this cable actually

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.170 
on the exterior of this cable actually
flex<00:01:31.320> and<00:01:31.560> Bend<00:01:31.770> more<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.400> get<00:01:32.490> pulled<00:01:32.850> more

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
flex and Bend more and get pulled more

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.140 
flex and Bend more and get pulled more
as<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.720> cable<00:01:34.049> gets<00:01:34.229> run<00:01:35.009> over<00:01:35.040> or<00:01:35.670> bent<00:01:35.939> in

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
as the cable gets run over or bent in

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.800 
as the cable gets run over or bent in
normal<00:01:36.540> usage<00:01:37.939> what<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.170> causes<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.530> by

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
normal usage what that causes and by

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:50.450 
normal usage what that causes and by
expected<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.200> be<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.439> issue<00:01:44.570> was<00:01:45.570> that<00:01:49.460> since

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
expected to be the issue was that since

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.240 
expected to be the issue was that since
that<00:01:50.670> happened<00:01:51.630> I<00:01:51.869> don't<00:01:52.799> know<00:01:52.890> if<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.100> can

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
that happened I don't know if you can

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.200 
that happened I don't know if you can
see<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.880> or<00:01:54.030> not<00:01:54.060> if<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.720> get<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> focus<00:01:56.570> but

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
see that or not if I get the focus but

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.359 
see that or not if I get the focus but
if<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.299> can't<00:02:00.509> get<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.810> focus<00:02:01.369> and

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
if I can't get that the focus and

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.639 
if I can't get that the focus and
basically<00:02:03.000> broke<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:04.909> farthest<00:02:05.909> outlying

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
basically broke the farthest outlying

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:13.580 
basically broke the farthest outlying
cable<00:02:07.819> the<00:02:08.819> white<00:02:09.149> wire<00:02:10.370> from<00:02:11.370> the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
cable the white wire from the

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.110 
cable the white wire from the
control<00:02:13.980> board<00:02:14.190> and<00:02:14.959> when<00:02:15.959> that<00:02:16.110> broke<00:02:17.120> it

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
control board and when that broke it

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.680 
control board and when that broke it
severed<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.900> line<00:02:19.140> for<00:02:19.319> the<00:02:19.380> mic<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.760> if<00:02:21.180> you

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 
severed the line for the mic so if you

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.390 
severed the line for the mic so if you
have<00:02:21.989> this<00:02:22.560> set<00:02:22.920> of<00:02:23.160> headphones<00:02:24.290> you<00:02:25.290> will<00:02:26.220> be

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 
have this set of headphones you will be

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.570 
have this set of headphones you will be
voiding<00:02:26.790> the<00:02:26.819> warranty<00:02:27.560> you<00:02:28.560> can<00:02:28.590> pop<00:02:29.370> the

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
voiding the warranty you can pop the

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.410 
voiding the warranty you can pop the
casing<00:02:30.030> open<00:02:30.890> the<00:02:31.890> alpha<00:02:32.489> set<00:02:32.760> has<00:02:33.030> this

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
casing open the alpha set has this

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.699

little kind of beveled casing right here

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.100 
little kind of beveled casing right here
and<00:02:37.890> then<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.790> wire<00:02:38.970> would<00:02:39.269> run<00:02:39.480> out<00:02:39.750> of<00:02:39.930> each

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
and then the wire would run out of each

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.640 
and then the wire would run out of each
side<00:02:41.180> it's<00:02:42.180> got<00:02:42.390> the<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:43.140> can<00:02:43.260> see<00:02:43.380> the<00:02:43.470> holes
