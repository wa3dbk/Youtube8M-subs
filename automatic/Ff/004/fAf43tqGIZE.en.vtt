bit wet so I'll wipe it out next thing

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.800 
bit wet so I'll wipe it out next thing
is<00:01:53.990> we're<00:01:54.740> going<00:01:54.890> to<00:01:55.040> outline<00:01:55.550> a<00:01:55.610> star<00:01:55.970> you<00:01:56.570> can

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
is we're going to outline a star you can

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.540 
is we're going to outline a star you can
use<00:01:57.230> a<00:01:57.620> sharp<00:01:58.550> point<00:01:58.910> of<00:01:59.680> scissors<00:02:00.680> ruler<00:02:01.130> and

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
use a sharp point of scissors ruler and

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.830 
use a sharp point of scissors ruler and
just<00:02:01.970> trace<00:02:02.300> it<00:02:02.330> or<00:02:02.720> you<00:02:02.870> can<00:02:03.020> use<00:02:03.230> a<00:02:03.260> sharpie

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
just trace it or you can use a sharpie

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.110 
just trace it or you can use a sharpie

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
so we're just going to trace it once

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.210 
so we're just going to trace it once
your<00:02:11.390> stars<00:02:11.660> trace<00:02:12.080> that<00:02:12.380> is<00:02:12.530> time<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:13.010> cut<00:02:13.190> it

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220 
your stars trace that is time to cut it

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:30.550 
your stars trace that is time to cut it
out<00:02:28.270> watch<00:02:29.270> every<00:02:29.570> star<00:02:29.810> we're<00:02:30.020> just<00:02:30.200> going<00:02:30.440> to

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
out watch every star we're just going to

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.160 
out watch every star we're just going to
bend<00:02:30.860> it<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.160> little<00:02:31.430> bit<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.300> it's<00:02:32.480> not<00:02:32.900> as

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
bend it a little bit so it's not as

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:41.230

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.740 
scissors a ruler we're going to do
little<00:02:54.890> folds<00:02:55.250> from<00:02:55.340> the<00:02:55.490> tip<00:02:55.760> to<00:02:56.209> the<00:02:56.300> bottom

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:56.750 
little folds from the tip to the bottom

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:58.990 
little folds from the tip to the bottom
the<00:02:57.110> tip<00:02:57.380> to<00:02:57.620> the<00:02:57.680> bottom<00:02:57.980> tips<00:02:58.220> bottom<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.820> the

the tip to the bottom tips bottom to the
bottom<00:02:59.300> now<00:03:00.220> this<00:03:01.220> ruler<00:03:01.550> will<00:03:02.060> move<00:03:02.330> so<00:03:03.850> go

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
bottom now this ruler will move so go

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.350 
bottom now this ruler will move so go
slow<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.950> don't<00:03:07.190> mess<00:03:07.340> up<00:03:07.520> hopefully<00:03:07.790> and<00:03:08.239> if

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
slow and don't mess up hopefully and if

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.270 
slow and don't mess up hopefully and if
you<00:03:08.480> do<00:03:08.690> you<00:03:08.930> still<00:03:09.230> have<00:03:09.500> plenty<00:03:09.830> of<00:03:10.100> the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
you do you still have plenty of the

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:25.740 
you do you still have plenty of the
aluminum<00:03:10.700> can<00:03:10.910> left<00:03:11.150> to<00:03:11.270> do<00:03:11.390> another<00:03:11.630> star

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:29.250 

okay<00:03:26.530> so<00:03:26.590> that<00:03:26.980> is<00:03:27.160> one<00:03:27.600> you<00:03:28.600> can<00:03:28.840> if<00:03:29.110> you<00:03:29.230> can

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
okay so that is one you can if you can

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:35.550 
okay so that is one you can if you can
see<00:03:29.680> the<00:03:30.460> fold<00:03:30.760> on<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.900> bottom<00:03:34.320> that<00:03:35.320> means

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
see the fold on the bottom that means

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.560 
see the fold on the bottom that means
you<00:03:36.040> did<00:03:36.220> a<00:03:36.250> good<00:03:36.430> job<00:03:36.490> you<00:03:37.240> don't<00:03:37.390> want<00:03:37.510> to

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
you did a good job you don't want to

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.480 
you did a good job you don't want to
make<00:03:37.630> it<00:03:37.810> too<00:03:38.020> deep<00:03:38.260> because<00:03:38.770> the<00:03:39.100> aluminum

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:39.490 
make it too deep because the aluminum

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:43.980 
make it too deep because the aluminum
can<00:03:39.700> will<00:03:41.280> break<00:03:42.280> apart<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:43.660> then<00:03:43.870> you're

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:43.990 
can will break apart and then you're

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.290 
can will break apart and then you're
gonna<00:03:44.080> start<00:03:44.440> over<00:03:44.670> so<00:03:45.670> this<00:03:45.850> is<00:03:46.000> how<00:03:46.150> your

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:46.300 
gonna start over so this is how your

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.580 
gonna start over so this is how your
star<00:03:46.570> should<00:03:46.810> look<00:03:47.020> right<00:03:47.260> now<00:03:49.260> before<00:03:50.260> we

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
star should look right now before we

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.140 
star should look right now before we
start<00:03:50.650> pinching<00:03:51.400> our<00:03:51.900> ends<00:03:53.340> there's<00:03:54.340> two<00:03:54.880> ways

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
start pinching our ends there's two ways

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.910 
start pinching our ends there's two ways
to<00:03:55.390> go<00:03:55.510> about<00:03:55.540> making<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:57.370> little<00:03:58.120> string<00:03:58.570> end

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
to go about making a little string end

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:01.620 
to go about making a little string end
to<00:03:59.920> hang<00:04:00.310> your<00:04:00.490> star<00:04:00.760> you<00:04:00.970> can<00:04:01.150> either<00:04:01.360> take<00:04:01.570> a

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
to hang your star you can either take a

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.420 
to hang your star you can either take a
really<00:04:01.990> small<00:04:02.290> hole<00:04:02.590> punch<00:04:02.890> which<00:04:03.160> you<00:04:03.280> could

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
really small hole punch which you could

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.300 
really small hole punch which you could
probably<00:04:03.640> find<00:04:04.030> that<00:04:04.120> Hobby<00:04:04.480> Lobby<00:04:04.600> and<00:04:05.310> punch

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
probably find that Hobby Lobby and punch

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.550 
probably find that Hobby Lobby and punch
a<00:04:06.490> hole<00:04:06.640> in<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.300> top<00:04:07.510> that<00:04:07.959> way<00:04:08.140> you<00:04:08.230> can<00:04:08.380> just

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
a hole in the top that way you can just

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.710 
a hole in the top that way you can just
put<00:04:08.860> some<00:04:09.010> strength<00:04:09.310> through<00:04:09.490> it<00:04:09.580> call<00:04:10.360> a<00:04:10.390> day

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
put some strength through it call a day

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.880 
put some strength through it call a day
or<00:04:11.530> you<00:04:12.100> can<00:04:12.370> just<00:04:12.700> after<00:04:13.570> folding<00:04:14.080> put<00:04:14.680> some

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
or you can just after folding put some

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
or you can just after folding put some
glue<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.580> a<00:04:16.299> wire<00:04:16.600> hook<00:04:17.169> on<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.500> back<00:04:17.910> put

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
glue and a wire hook on the back put

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.120 
glue and a wire hook on the back put
some<00:04:19.120> strength<00:04:19.419> through<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:19.810> wire<00:04:19.989> hook<00:04:20.410> and

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
some strength through that wire hook and

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.490 
some strength through that wire hook and
you're<00:04:22.030> done<00:04:22.240> that<00:04:22.419> way<00:04:22.630> now<00:04:22.930> we're<00:04:23.140> gonna<00:04:23.230> do

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
you're done that way now we're gonna do

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.500 
you're done that way now we're gonna do
that<00:04:24.100> we<00:04:24.220> have<00:04:24.370> our<00:04:24.520> perforated<00:04:24.970> folds<00:04:25.360> is

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
that we have our perforated folds is

00:04:25.510 --> 00:05:03.220 
that we have our perforated folds is
just<00:04:26.260> start<00:04:26.500> pinching<00:04:27.100> at<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.550> ends

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.980 

and<00:05:03.620> this<00:05:04.370> is<00:05:04.520> what<00:05:04.700> happens<00:05:05.090> if<00:05:05.390> it's<00:05:05.600> two

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
and this is what happens if it's two

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.830 
and this is what happens if it's two
folded<00:05:06.470> so<00:05:06.830> let<00:05:07.640> me<00:05:07.760> make<00:05:07.880> another<00:05:08.060> one<00:05:08.420> and<00:05:08.630> I

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
folded so let me make another one and I

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:18.220 
folded so let me make another one and I
will<00:05:09.020> be<00:05:09.740> back<00:05:16.030> take<00:05:17.030> to<00:05:17.180> it<00:05:17.240> now<00:05:17.960> with<00:05:18.110> the

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:18.230 
will be back take to it now with the

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.360 
will be back take to it now with the
first<00:05:18.440> start<00:05:18.740> I<00:05:19.040> folded<00:05:19.700> it<00:05:19.850> way<00:05:20.780> too<00:05:21.500> much<00:05:21.770> so

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
first start I folded it way too much so

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.670 
first start I folded it way too much so
we<00:05:22.490> need<00:05:22.610> to<00:05:22.700> be<00:05:22.850> extra<00:05:23.540> extra<00:05:23.690> careful<00:05:24.050> while

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:24.680 
we need to be extra extra careful while

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.570 
we need to be extra extra careful while
folding<00:05:25.220> our<00:05:25.430> ends<00:05:26.950> we're<00:05:27.950> not<00:05:28.100> going<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.310> fold

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:28.580 
folding our ends we're not going to fold

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.110 
folding our ends we're not going to fold
them<00:05:28.760> down<00:05:28.790> as<00:05:29.270> much<00:05:30.220> but<00:05:31.220> more<00:05:31.430> get<00:05:31.970> an

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
them down as much but more get an

00:05:32.120 --> 00:06:10.380 
them down as much but more get an
outline<00:05:32.390> of<00:05:33.230> it<00:05:33.560> like<00:05:34.250> that

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.230 

this<00:06:10.960> is<00:06:11.110> what<00:06:11.290> I<00:06:11.320> have<00:06:11.560> now<00:06:12.250> I'm<00:06:12.670> going<00:06:13.090> to
