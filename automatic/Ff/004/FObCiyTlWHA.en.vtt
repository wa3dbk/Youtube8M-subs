00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.990 

alright<00:04:07.800> now<00:04:08.130> let's<00:04:08.489> put<00:04:08.700> that<00:04:08.849> together

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
alright now let's put that together

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.460 
alright now let's put that together
let's<00:04:09.330> start<00:04:09.510> at<00:04:09.569> the<00:04:09.630> very<00:04:09.690> beginning<00:04:09.930> and<00:04:10.319> go

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
let's start at the very beginning and go

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.089 
let's start at the very beginning and go
that<00:04:10.650> far

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
that far

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:23.070 
that far
one<00:04:11.370> two<00:04:11.910> ready<00:04:12.239> go

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.320 

so<00:04:24.080> this<00:04:24.230> manager<00:04:24.620> a<00:04:24.770> minor<00:04:25.070> is<00:04:25.340> low<00:04:25.610> a<00:04:25.640> then

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
so this manager a minor is low a then

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:27.690 
so this manager a minor is low a then
the<00:04:26.420> right<00:04:26.570> hand<00:04:26.720> comes<00:04:26.930> in<00:04:27.050> with<00:04:27.230> a<00:04:27.290> middle<00:04:27.530> a

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
the right hand comes in with a middle a

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.520 
the right hand comes in with a middle a
don't<00:04:28.700> play<00:04:28.820> C<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.300> E<00:04:29.420> together<00:04:29.690> with<00:04:30.260> three

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
don't play C and E together with three

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.470 
don't play C and E together with three
and<00:04:30.650> five<00:04:30.860> as<00:04:31.100> you<00:04:31.130> play<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.460> thumb<00:04:31.880> a<00:04:32.090> on<00:04:32.390> the

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:32.480 
and five as you play the thumb a on the

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.860 
and five as you play the thumb a on the
left<00:04:32.660> hand<00:04:33.310> if<00:04:34.310> we<00:04:34.430> go<00:04:34.550> back<00:04:34.700> to<00:04:34.730> in<00:04:35.360> Lane<00:04:35.570> and

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
left hand if we go back to in Lane and

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.230 
left hand if we go back to in Lane and
we<00:04:36.380> go<00:04:36.470> back<00:04:36.620> to<00:04:36.770> the<00:04:36.860> C<00:04:37.040> and<00:04:37.160> E<00:04:37.250> so<00:04:37.520> this

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:38.240 
we go back to the C and E so this

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:45.760 
we go back to the C and E so this
measure<00:04:38.600> is<00:04:38.840> one<00:04:43.780> let's<00:04:44.780> add<00:04:45.050> that<00:04:45.260> on<00:04:45.500> okay

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
measure is one let's add that on okay

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:57.640 
measure is one let's add that on okay
back<00:04:45.950> to<00:04:46.070> the<00:04:46.160> beginning<00:04:46.550> ready<00:04:46.850> go

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:04.040 

then<00:04:58.100> we're<00:04:58.190> gonna<00:04:58.280> do<00:04:58.490> this

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.260 

okay

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
okay

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.240 
okay
this<00:05:06.780> measures<00:05:07.260> a<00:05:07.290> little<00:05:07.380> bit<00:05:07.740> tricky<00:05:08.070> so

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
this measures a little bit tricky so

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.970 
this measures a little bit tricky so
watch<00:05:08.430> here<00:05:08.670> we<00:05:08.790> have<00:05:08.910> low<00:05:09.120> E<00:05:09.470> and<00:05:10.470> then<00:05:10.590> up<00:05:10.830> to

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980 
watch here we have low E and then up to

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.270 
watch here we have low E and then up to
be<00:05:11.390> here<00:05:12.390> Oh<00:05:12.480> do<00:05:12.660> G<00:05:12.930> sharp<00:05:13.230> B<00:05:13.350> D<00:05:13.710> of<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.070> right
