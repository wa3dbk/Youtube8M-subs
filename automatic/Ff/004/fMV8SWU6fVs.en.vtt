basically what I plan on doing is I am
going<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.090> probably<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.720> sky<00:01:39.960> bridge<00:01:40.290> as

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
going to probably do the sky bridge as

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.460 
going to probably do the sky bridge as
well<00:01:40.829> as<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> tunnel<00:01:41.659> just<00:01:42.659> like<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.290> xbox

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
well as the tunnel just like in the xbox

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.170 
well as the tunnel just like in the xbox
360<00:01:43.890> version<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.610> was<00:01:44.729> trying<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.030> do<00:01:45.149> I

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
360 version like I was trying to do I

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.850 
360 version like I was trying to do I
will<00:01:45.509> tunnel<00:01:45.720> to<00:01:45.869> Orlan<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.409> then<00:01:46.500> probably

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
will tunnel to Orlan and then probably

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.770 
will tunnel to Orlan and then probably
build<00:01:47.220> the<00:01:47.369> skybridge<00:01:47.790> out<00:01:48.030> there<00:01:48.329> hopefully

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
build the skybridge out there hopefully

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.280 
build the skybridge out there hopefully
to<00:01:49.470> orland<00:01:49.860> i'm<00:01:50.850> not<00:01:51.030> sure<00:01:51.240> i'm<00:01:51.720> not<00:01:51.810> sure<00:01:52.079> if

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
to orland i'm not sure i'm not sure if

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.330

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
know if it's ever expanding and stuff

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.559 
know if it's ever expanding and stuff
they<00:04:52.229> never<00:04:52.439> really<00:04:52.650> have<00:04:53.250> said<00:04:53.969> I<00:04:54.000> know<00:04:54.180> that

they never really have said I know that

00:04:54.569 --> 00:04:58.519 
they never really have said I know that
it<00:04:54.719> is<00:04:54.810> on<00:04:54.960> xbox<00:04:55.259> but<00:04:55.590> like<00:04:56.389> I<00:04:57.389> don't<00:04:58.110> know<00:04:58.259> like

00:04:58.519 --> 00:04:58.529 
it is on xbox but like I don't know like

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:02.240 
it is on xbox but like I don't know like
I<00:04:58.740> just<00:04:58.800> I<00:04:59.069> don't<00:04:59.129> know<00:04:59.430> how<00:05:00.020> far<00:05:01.020> if<00:05:01.439> biomes

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:02.250

00:05:10.399 --> 00:05:10.409 
all of that stuff and I can't wait I

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:11.990 
all of that stuff and I can't wait I
can't<00:05:10.770> wait<00:05:11.039> and<00:05:11.279> we<00:05:11.340> grab<00:05:11.520> some<00:05:11.550> this<00:05:11.789> coal

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 
can't wait and we grab some this coal

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.279

because I need coal I need that Cole

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.080 
because I need coal I need that Cole
need<00:05:13.949> be<00:05:14.069> careful<00:05:14.430> because<00:05:14.580> we're<00:05:14.849> going<00:05:15.000> to

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
need be careful because we're going to

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.480 
need be careful because we're going to
new<00:05:15.629> territory<00:05:16.139> and<00:05:16.349> that<00:05:16.529> spawns<00:05:17.009> more

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
new territory and that spawns more

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.379 
new territory and that spawns more
zombies<00:05:18.060> so<00:05:18.210> that's<00:05:18.360> going<00:05:18.479> to<00:05:18.569> be<00:05:18.659> a<00:05:18.990> little

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
zombies so that's going to be a little

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:22.670 
zombies so that's going to be a little

i<00:05:44.500> think<00:05:45.010> if<00:05:45.490> i<00:05:45.550> remember<00:05:45.700> correctly<00:05:46.030> so<00:05:46.660> the

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:46.900 
i think if i remember correctly so the

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:48.090 
i think if i remember correctly so the
further<00:05:47.050> out<00:05:47.290> you<00:05:47.350> get<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.830> heart<00:05:47.980> of<00:05:48.070> the

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.100 
further out you get the heart of the

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.360 
further out you get the heart of the
article<00:05:48.580> so<00:05:49.260> I'll<00:05:50.260> be<00:05:50.470> all<00:05:50.620> right<00:05:50.650> should<00:05:51.250> be

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
article so I'll be all right should be

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.770 
article so I'll be all right should be
but<00:05:51.640> that<00:05:51.700> dragon<00:05:52.120> is<00:05:52.210> definitely<00:05:52.600> going<00:05:52.690> to

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:52.780 
but that dragon is definitely going to

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:54.210 
but that dragon is definitely going to
FSU<00:05:53.050> because<00:05:53.500> this<00:05:53.710> I'm<00:05:53.920> playing<00:05:54.130> on<00:05:54.190> normal

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:17.920 
tunnel into this mountain and hide I

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:19.590 
tunnel into this mountain and hide I
think<00:06:18.220> that's<00:06:18.310> probably<00:06:18.460> why<00:06:18.640> we<00:06:18.790> do<00:06:18.940> and<00:06:19.450> hide

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
think that's probably why we do and hide

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.300 
think that's probably why we do and hide
from<00:06:19.630> the<00:06:19.840> dragon<00:06:20.260> because<00:06:20.680> I<00:06:20.860> can't<00:06:21.070> kill<00:06:21.220> the

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
from the dragon because I can't kill the

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:22.890
