00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
earthquake spell is it can just be used

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.020 
earthquake spell is it can just be used
to<00:00:30.689> weaken<00:00:31.080> or<00:00:31.230> soften<00:00:31.710> up<00:00:31.890> structures<00:00:32.489> so<00:00:32.940> you

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
to weaken or soften up structures so you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.910 
to weaken or soften up structures so you
can<00:00:33.180> use<00:00:33.360> this<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.719> really<00:00:34.110> take<00:00:34.320> a<00:00:34.350> chunk<00:00:34.770> of

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
can use this to really take a chunk of

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.160 
can use this to really take a chunk of
hitpoints<00:00:35.550> out<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:36.180> high<00:00:36.390> base<00:00:36.690> hit<00:00:36.930> point

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
hitpoints out of high base hit point

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.530 
hitpoints out of high base hit point
structures<00:00:37.710> such<00:00:38.280> as<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> inferno<00:00:38.910> towers<00:00:39.180> or

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
structures such as the inferno towers or

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.810 
structures such as the inferno towers or
expose<00:00:40.290> again<00:00:40.950> remember<00:00:41.340> one<00:00:41.579> earthquake

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
expose again remember one earthquake

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.910 
expose again remember one earthquake
spell<00:00:42.329> is<00:00:42.540> half<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.020> housing<00:00:43.410> space<00:00:43.680> as<00:00:43.860> a

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
spell is half the housing space as a

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.950 
spell is half the housing space as a
lightning<00:00:44.579> spell<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.180> it's<00:00:45.600> actually<00:00:45.719> a

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
lightning spell so it's actually a

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.720 
lightning spell so it's actually a
pretty<00:00:46.170> good<00:00:46.500> efficient<00:00:47.070> spell<00:00:47.340> if<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.579> want

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
high hitpoints structures all right so

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.850 
high hitpoints structures all right so
the<00:00:51.570> second<00:00:51.870> point<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.199> want<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.469> bring<00:00:52.559> up

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the second point I want to bring up

regarding your earthquake spells is you
can<00:00:55.050> sort<00:00:55.260> of<00:00:55.440> view<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:55.770> as<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.280> permanent<00:00:56.760> jump

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
can sort of view it as a permanent jump

spell now based on the tests that we've
been<00:00:59.789> able<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.090> run<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.780> seems<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.350> for

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
been able to run it seems that for

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.160 
been able to run it seems that for
earthquakes<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.550> take<00:01:02.879> down<00:01:03.120> rows<00:01:03.600> of<00:01:03.870> walls

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
earthquakes can take down rows of walls

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.050 
earthquakes can take down rows of walls
entirely<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:05.369> now<00:01:05.549> you<00:01:05.640> might<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:05.880> wondering

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
entirely but now you might be wondering

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.910 
entirely but now you might be wondering
well<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.600> earthquake<00:01:07.020> spells<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.710> means

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
well for earthquake spells that means

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.219 
well for earthquake spells that means
for<00:01:08.159> housing<00:01:08.520> spell<00:01:08.760> spaces<00:01:09.270> if<00:01:09.450> it's<00:01:10.080> only

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
for housing spell spaces if it's only

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.929 
for housing spell spaces if it's only
equal<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.560> one<00:01:10.710> jump<00:01:10.979> spell<00:01:11.250> isn't<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.760> you

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
equal to one jump spell isn't that you

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.120 
equal to one jump spell isn't that you
know<00:01:12.060> to<00:01:12.659> housing<00:01:12.990> spell<00:01:13.200> spaces<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.770> isn't

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
know to housing spell spaces so isn't

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.190 
know to housing spell spaces so isn't
that<00:01:14.189> kind<00:01:14.430> of<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.549> waste<00:01:14.790> well<00:01:15.390> if<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.990> think

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
that kind of a waste well if you think

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.080 
that kind of a waste well if you think
about<00:01:16.380> it<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:17.009> look<00:01:17.189> at<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
about it and you look at the the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.429 
about it and you look at the the
earthquake<00:01:18.420> spells<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.930> damage<00:01:19.290> that

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
earthquake spells and the damage that

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.719 
earthquake spells and the damage that
they've<00:01:19.590> done<00:01:19.770> right<00:01:19.950> here<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.460> actually

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
they've done right here it actually

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.109 
they've done right here it actually
weakened<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> expo<00:01:22.320> so<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.549> also<00:01:23.790> think

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
weakened the expo so you can also think

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.870 
weakened the expo so you can also think
of<00:01:24.270> this<00:01:24.479> earthquake<00:01:25.170> spell<00:01:25.439> as<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.979> mixture<00:01:26.790> of

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
of this earthquake spell as a mixture of

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.700 
of this earthquake spell as a mixture of
jump<00:01:27.420> spells<00:01:27.689> plus<00:01:28.080> lightning<00:01:28.470> spells

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
jump spells plus lightning spells

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.230 
jump spells plus lightning spells
combined<00:01:29.100> it's<00:01:29.250> basically<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.670> jump<00:01:29.970> spell

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
combined it's basically a jump spell

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.109 
combined it's basically a jump spell
that<00:01:30.720> damages<00:01:31.380> buildings<00:01:32.100> as<00:01:32.250> well<00:01:32.520> because

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
that damages buildings as well because

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.880 
that damages buildings as well because
of<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.390> earthquakes<00:01:33.900> unique<00:01:34.259> ability<00:01:34.770> to

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
of that earthquakes unique ability to

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.980 
of that earthquakes unique ability to
weaken<00:01:35.189> structures<00:01:35.729> so<00:01:36.299> again<00:01:36.659> it's

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
weaken structures so again it's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.630 
weaken structures so again it's
essentially<00:01:37.590> a<00:01:37.619> jump<00:01:37.920> spell<00:01:38.009> plus<00:01:38.460> a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
essentially a jump spell plus a

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.880 
essentially a jump spell plus a
lightning<00:01:38.939> spell<00:01:39.210> rolled<00:01:39.509> into<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:39.900> at<00:01:40.290> half

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
lightning spell rolled into one at half

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.940 
lightning spell rolled into one at half

a wall is very weak and weak enough so

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.330 
a wall is very weak and weak enough so
that<00:01:51.780> maybe<00:01:51.930> one<00:01:52.290> earthquake<00:01:52.560> spell<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.189> help
