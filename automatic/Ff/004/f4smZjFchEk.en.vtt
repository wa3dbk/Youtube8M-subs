00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.640
 Hello, sir, Welcome to Modest Taste Cuisine 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.640
 we have a local recipe in this section 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:18.440
 A nice dessert brought by migrants from Thessaloniki in Edirne 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.960
 We will learn the construction of "Barbushka" 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.960
 But if you want to have a look at the necessary materials before 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.440
 1 cup of thinly drawn walnut 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.240
 1.5 cup powdered sugar 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.600
 2 tablespoons of butter 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.080
 1 coffee cup corn flour 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.960
 1 coffee cup of wheat flour 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.200
 and 4 cups of water 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.600
 Let's go to the construction of a barbecue. 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.880
 we put the pot on fire, we left the butter 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.360
 and 1 cup of coconut added 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.840
 we'll roast in medium heat until it changes a little 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.840
 walnut color 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.760
 now we add 1.5 cups of our sugar powder 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.440
 a short turn we're doing this a few turns 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.680
 Now, the corn flour ... 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.840
 and adding wheat flour 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:55.400
 and add cold water to prevent agglomeration 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:03.000
 after that we cook until mixing 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.240
 baking 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.120
 Let's close the fire now and leave it in the bowls 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.160
 Now let's leave the foodstuffs in serving bowls 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.680
 After the first heat is put in the refrigerator and cooling for at least 2 hours 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.760
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.760
 we shared a different and local recipe 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.040
 We learned the construction of "Barbushkan". 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.880
 I would like you to try and remember us as soon as possible 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.640
 goodbye...
