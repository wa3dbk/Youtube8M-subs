00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.100
There was nothing but darkness
My lips trembled ceaseless

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.920
Alone in my departament I was crying

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.300
The more I get close, the more wounds I had

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.860
You must fulfill what you promise

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.000
Nobody will save me

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.040
Only to God I will ask that this love I don't tear it more

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.440
I need your love
I'm a broken rose

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.940
On my head I always hear your song 
It reminds me that I don't have salvation

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:15.360
I need your love
I'm a broken rose

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:22.240
With the sadness I will freeze
It's my pain, save me from my life

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:32.160
I wanna need your love
I'm a broken rose
I wanna need your love

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.280
And when you were next to me
I was like a shadow of you

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.760
You couldnÂ´t stop me

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.640
The more I get away, the most ways I loved you

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.240
Kiss me gentle an with love

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.040
Nobody will save me

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:05.080
I'm like a frozen rose. Mi tears want to rest

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.640
I need your love
I'm a broken rose

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.060
I feel like my soul dies in the solitude
I'm a withered child in the coldness

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.900
I need your love
I'm a broken rose

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.640
With the sadness I will freeze
It's my pain, save me from my life

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.640
I wanna need your love
I'm a broken rose
I wanna need your love

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.780
