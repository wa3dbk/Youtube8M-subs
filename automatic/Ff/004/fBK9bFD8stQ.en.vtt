so let's make the lampshade so you
probably<00:01:48.790> want<00:01:49.060> to<00:01:49.119> start<00:01:49.270> with<00:01:49.390> a<00:01:49.420> dark<00:01:49.630> color

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
probably want to start with a dark color

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.120 
probably want to start with a dark color
for<00:01:50.680> like<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:50.979> outlining<00:01:51.310> part<00:01:51.700> and<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.979> you

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
for like the outlining part and if you

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.499 
for like the outlining part and if you
if<00:01:54.340> you're<00:01:54.490> not<00:01:54.640> onto<00:01:54.850> shading<00:01:55.240> or<00:01:55.330> anything

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
if you're not onto shading or anything

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.670 
if you're not onto shading or anything
that's<00:01:56.140> okay<00:01:56.530> I<00:01:56.560> guess<00:01:56.860> upwards<00:01:57.369> I<00:01:58.560> forgot<00:01:59.560> to

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
that's okay I guess upwards I forgot to

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.389 
that's okay I guess upwards I forgot to
make<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.009> curved

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
make it curved

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.100 
make it curved
I<00:02:00.580> gotta<00:02:01.119> quickly<00:02:01.360> hurry<00:02:01.690> this<00:02:01.869> up<00:02:02.460> okay

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
I gotta quickly hurry this up okay

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.870 
I gotta quickly hurry this up okay
characters<00:02:05.110> like<00:02:05.229> that<00:02:05.259> and<00:02:05.799> you<00:02:06.580> want<00:02:06.700> to

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
characters like that and you want to

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.910 
characters like that and you want to
darken<00:02:07.270> you<00:02:07.960> want<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.170> brighten<00:02:08.470> up<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:08.649> color

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
darken you want to brighten up the color

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.720 
darken you want to brighten up the color
a<00:02:09.009> bit<00:02:09.100> for<00:02:09.580> shading<00:02:10.230> like<00:02:11.230> that<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:12.459> want

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
a bit for shading like that and you want

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.750 
a bit for shading like that and you want
to<00:02:12.850> do<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:13.930> again<00:02:13.989> for<00:02:14.560> its<00:02:15.069> regular<00:02:15.580> color

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
to do it again for its regular color

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.680 
to do it again for its regular color
like<00:02:16.510> this<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.190> you<00:02:18.190> finally<00:02:18.730> want<00:02:18.970> maybe<00:02:19.239> to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
like this and you finally want maybe to

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.460 
like this and you finally want maybe to
maybe<00:02:20.260> have<00:02:20.560> some<00:02:20.769> lighting<00:02:21.069> on<00:02:21.310> it<00:02:25.319> okay<00:02:26.319> I

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
maybe have some lighting on it okay I

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.400 
maybe have some lighting on it okay I
think<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.800> have<00:02:26.920> all<00:02:27.040> my<00:02:27.069> things

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
think I have all my things

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.110 
think I have all my things
yeah<00:02:29.410> so<00:02:29.920> first<00:02:30.430> of<00:02:30.550> all<00:02:30.640> I'll<00:02:30.760> start<00:02:30.970> with<00:02:31.030> the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
yeah so first of all I'll start with the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.170 
yeah so first of all I'll start with the
shading<00:02:31.769> zoom<00:02:32.769> in<00:02:33.600> do<00:02:34.600> this<00:02:35.910> put<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:36.970> down<00:02:37.060> the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
shading zoom in do this put it down the

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.070 
shading zoom in do this put it down the
line<00:02:37.360> where<00:02:37.630> it<00:02:38.080> should<00:02:38.530> go<00:02:38.560> and<00:02:38.920> if<00:02:39.459> an<00:02:39.670> object

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
line where it should go and if an object

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.140 
line where it should go and if an object
doesn't<00:02:41.080> need<00:02:41.350> and<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.250> doesn't<00:02:42.549> it's<00:02:42.700> not<00:02:42.790> it

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
doesn't need and it doesn't it's not it

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.860 
doesn't need and it doesn't it's not it
so<00:02:43.900> that<00:02:44.140> doesn't<00:02:44.470> have<00:02:45.569> you'll<00:02:46.569> have<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.750> make

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
so that doesn't have you'll have to make

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.810 
so that doesn't have you'll have to make
it<00:02:46.989> necessary<00:02:47.440> first<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.829> have<00:02:47.980> shading<00:02:48.489> like

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
it necessary first to have shading like

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.180 
it necessary first to have shading like
this<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.120> like<00:02:49.239> this<00:02:49.510> could<00:02:49.690> be<00:02:49.780> plate<00:02:50.440> made<00:02:51.100> of

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
this is like this could be plate made of

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.870 
this is like this could be plate made of
plastic

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
plastic

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.690 
plastic
like<00:02:52.150> for<00:02:52.299> example<00:02:52.329> Santa<00:02:52.900> hat<00:02:53.459> Santa<00:02:54.459> hat<00:02:54.579> is

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
like for example Santa hat Santa hat is

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.759 
like for example Santa hat Santa hat is
made<00:02:54.850> of<00:02:55.000> felt<00:02:55.329> and<00:02:55.690> felt<00:02:56.170> does<00:02:56.410> not<00:02:56.560> have

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
made of felt and felt does not have

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.190 
made of felt and felt does not have
really<00:02:57.220> much<00:02:57.370> like<00:02:57.670> brightness<00:02:58.150> like<00:02:58.690> a<00:02:58.870> clock

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
really much like brightness like a clock

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.140 
really much like brightness like a clock
of<00:02:59.440> course<00:02:59.709> would<00:02:59.950> have<00:02:59.980> kind<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.000> this

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
of course would have kind of this

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.360 
of course would have kind of this
brightness<00:03:01.420> so<00:03:01.780> think<00:03:01.959> logically<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:02.980> don't

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
brightness so think logically so don't

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.340 
brightness so think logically so don't
give<00:03:03.609> like<00:03:03.910> I<00:03:04.920> don't<00:03:05.920> know<00:03:06.130> like<00:03:06.160> a<00:03:07.109> blanket<00:03:08.109> or

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
give like I don't know like a blanket or

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.699 
give like I don't know like a blanket or
a<00:03:08.799> piece<00:03:09.010> of<00:03:09.040> felt<00:03:09.430> like<00:03:10.269> oh<00:03:10.450> crap<00:03:11.290> plasma

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
a piece of felt like oh crap plasma

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.530 
a piece of felt like oh crap plasma
Empire<00:03:11.980> I'll<00:03:12.250> forget<00:03:12.760> what<00:03:12.820> I<00:03:12.970> just<00:03:13.150> said<00:03:13.299> um

Empire I'll forget what I just said um
you<00:03:13.840> could<00:03:14.140> probably<00:03:14.380> use<00:03:14.680> do<00:03:15.310> um<00:03:15.700> you<00:03:15.910> know

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
you could probably use do um you know

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.190 
you could probably use do um you know
brightness<00:03:18.100> you<00:03:19.030> know<00:03:19.150> like<00:03:19.690> on<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.840> roll<00:03:20.079> of

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
brightness you know like on a roll of

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.720 
brightness you know like on a roll of
tape<00:03:20.440> something<00:03:20.920> like<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.160> which<00:03:21.280> is<00:03:21.310> good

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
tape something like that which is good

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.490 
tape something like that which is good
but<00:03:22.209> don't<00:03:22.540> do<00:03:22.840> it<00:03:22.930> on<00:03:22.989> something<00:03:23.170> that's<00:03:23.350> very

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
but don't do it on something that's very

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.050 
but don't do it on something that's very
that's<00:03:23.950> not<00:03:24.190> necessary

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
that's not necessary

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:27.360 
that's not necessary
plasma<00:03:25.930> Empire<00:03:26.200> just<00:03:26.350> forget<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.829> forget<00:03:27.130> away
