00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 because I need to know where to leave the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.729
 bike 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.420
 do not have this only if it's going to 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:08.420
 leave the bicycles 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.830
 you just have to leave the bar 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.490
 is the response that August received 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.470
 step a santiaguino cyclist when 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.990
 tried to do a procedure in immigration 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.670
 as august there are hundreds of cyclists 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.710
 that they receive this type of 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.330
 answers when they need to perform 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.270
 procedures in the various buildings 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.460
 public of santiago simply not 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.140
 there is where to leave the bicycle at the time 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.540
 to say they have parking the 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.340
 bicycle a roundabout in some places 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.630
 as they have the facility to be able 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.970
 enter and leave the entrance a gate now 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.230
 the issue is that they tell me now but 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.120
 He has also told me in other times 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.160
 then I go back and wait it's not in the 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.650
 general treasury of the republic the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.150
 panorama was not very different from the previous 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.150
 we do not have bikes 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:04.530
 no longer you have problems that leave 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:14.520
 the same difficulty we find in the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.229
 Sernac of the public buildings of the 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.880
 capital for example I would say that in turn 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.399
 in this of their values ​​they did not let me 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.960
 I usually go I to 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:23.399
 bank entered with me if I never the 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.530
 after the experience of a bike 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.569
 like the stream and do not respond for it 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.610
 in our journey the only two 

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:31.979
 public buildings that did think 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.229
 the cyclists were these the library 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.899
 national and the ministry of education in 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.060
 chile are having more cyclists in 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.619
 the streets in santiago there is a quantity 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.349
 incredible of cyclists that has joined 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.720
 the last years and that reality and that 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:47.369
 face it if we want the 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.739
 especially young people use the 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.420
 bicycle is good they have to have a 

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:52.829
 place where to leave it a decree of 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.989
 Ministry of Housing and Urban Planning 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:56.849
 indicates that buildings for public use 

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:59.579
 that are projected with a load of 

00:01:56.849 --> 00:02:02.009
 occupation of more than 1000 people 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.840
 include at least one structure for 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.969
 bicycle parking with 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.250
 ability to park a bicycle 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.110
 for every 10 parking lots for 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.060
 vehicles but that's not an obligation 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.520
 nowadays it is only if the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.660
 regulatory plan points it 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.580
 these should be installed 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.710
 bicycle parking lots in my 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.080
 knowledge today there are no blueprints 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.880
 regulators that incorporate that as how 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.250
 an obligation a regulation that 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.290
 curiously, it is not an obligation to comply 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.020
 so august and thousands of cyclists 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.100
 more will have to keep looking for where 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:34.100
 leave your bicycles
