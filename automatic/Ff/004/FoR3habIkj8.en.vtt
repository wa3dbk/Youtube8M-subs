you can go in and actually do

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.089 
you can go in and actually do
quarter-mile<00:00:09.450> tests<00:00:10.260> it'll<00:00:10.620> actually<00:00:10.769> drop

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
quarter-mile tests it'll actually drop

the<00:00:11.130> tree<00:00:11.429> down<00:00:11.550> for<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.410> it<00:00:13.410> will<00:00:13.559> do

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
the tree down for you it will do

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.180 
the tree down for you it will do
reaction<00:00:14.190> time<00:00:14.900> et<00:00:15.900> mile-per-hour<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:17.010> so

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
reaction time et mile-per-hour and so

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.330 
reaction time et mile-per-hour and so
forth<00:00:17.490> I<00:00:17.730> think<00:00:18.330> it's<00:00:18.449> eight<00:00:19.080> mile<00:00:19.380> here<00:00:19.859> and<00:00:20.100> a

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
forth I think it's eight mile here and a

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.300 
forth I think it's eight mile here and a
zero<00:00:21.150> to<00:00:21.270> sixty<00:00:21.689> as<00:00:21.810> well<00:00:22.020> just<00:00:22.949> some<00:00:23.070> kind<00:00:23.250> of

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
zero to sixty as well just some kind of

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.019 
zero to sixty as well just some kind of
neat<00:00:23.400> things<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.640> think<00:00:23.699> they're<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:23.970> to

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
neat things I think they're going to

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.730 
neat things I think they're going to
have<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> horsepower<00:00:24.449> calculator<00:00:25.140> at<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.590> as

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
have a horsepower calculator at it as

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.160 
have a horsepower calculator at it as
well<00:00:26.180> if<00:00:27.180> it's<00:00:27.390> not<00:00:27.570> already<00:00:27.720> in<00:00:27.990> here

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
well if it's not already in here

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:33.110 
well if it's not already in here
somewhere<00:00:31.189> another<00:00:32.189> kind<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.579> nice<00:00:32.730> thing<00:00:32.969> is

automatically scan for different

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.130 
automatically scan for different
vehicles<00:01:00.649> I<00:01:02.420> think<00:01:03.420> what<00:01:03.629> else<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:03.989> is<00:01:04.019> in

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
vehicles I think what else there is in

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.570 
vehicles I think what else there is in
here

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.050 

we<00:01:10.060> change<00:01:10.420> how<00:01:10.600> bright<00:01:10.900> the<00:01:11.549> backlight<00:01:12.549> is<00:01:12.760> on

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
we change how bright the backlight is on

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:22.469 
we change how bright the backlight is on
the<00:01:13.180> display<00:01:15.270> log<00:01:16.270> files<00:01:19.140> in<00:01:21.210> here<00:01:22.210> is<00:01:22.330> where

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
the display log files in here is where

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:24.300 
the display log files in here is where
you'll<00:01:22.630> find<00:01:22.840> some<00:01:23.290> of<00:01:23.409> the<00:01:23.500> more<00:01:23.770> advanced

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
you'll find some of the more advanced

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.359 
you'll find some of the more advanced
features<00:01:24.729> they'll<00:01:25.210> have<00:01:25.979> several<00:01:26.979> analog

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
features they'll have several analog

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.670 
features they'll have several analog
input<00:01:27.820> modes<00:01:28.710> for<00:01:29.710> use<00:01:29.860> with<00:01:30.100> the<00:01:31.530> plugs<00:01:32.530> on

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
input modes for use with the plugs on

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.130 
input modes for use with the plugs on
the<00:01:32.710> back<00:01:32.950> of<00:01:33.190> the<00:01:33.280> unit

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.840 

usually<00:01:38.140> it's<00:01:38.290> you're<00:01:39.190> just<00:01:39.430> running<00:01:39.700> out<00:01:39.820> of

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
usually it's you're just running out of

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:53.070 
usually it's you're just running out of
obd2<00:01:41.160> instead<00:01:42.160> of<00:01:42.250> having<00:01:42.460> just<00:01:44.220> obd<00:01:45.220> to<00:01:46.619> see

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.640 

instead<00:01:54.080> of<00:01:54.200> having<00:01:54.380> just<00:01:54.700> obd2<00:01:56.470> things<00:01:57.470> to

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:57.650 
instead of having just obd2 things to

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.710 
instead of having just obd2 things to
pull<00:01:57.860> from<00:01:58.100> when<00:01:58.850> you're<00:01:59.030> in<00:01:59.150> your<00:01:59.270> gages

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
pull from when you're in your gages

pull from when you're in your gages
screen<00:02:00.049> for<00:02:00.350> example<00:02:00.440> like<00:02:01.070> here<00:02:01.340> if<00:02:01.430> you<00:02:01.549> want

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
screen for example like here if you want

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.010 
screen for example like here if you want
to<00:02:01.790> data<00:02:01.970> log<00:02:02.150> your<00:02:02.330> wideband

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
to data log your wideband

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.530 
to data log your wideband
you<00:02:03.500> would<00:02:03.590> click<00:02:03.799> on<00:02:03.860> one<00:02:04.190> of<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.369> cells<00:02:04.670> go

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
you would click on one of the cells go

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.899 
you would click on one of the cells go
to<00:02:05.600> a<00:02:05.720> sign<00:02:05.960> signal<00:02:06.530> and<00:02:06.799> then<00:02:07.430> instead<00:02:07.850> of

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
to a sign signal and then instead of

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.710 
to a sign signal and then instead of
having<00:02:08.149> just<00:02:08.330> generic<00:02:08.989> obd2<00:02:09.350> here<00:02:09.770> at<00:02:09.860> the<00:02:09.950> top

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
having just generic obd2 here at the top

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.860 
having just generic obd2 here at the top
you<00:02:11.720> would<00:02:11.840> do<00:02:12.020> analog<00:02:12.650> input<00:02:13.100> as<00:02:13.970> far<00:02:14.180> as<00:02:14.360> raw

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
you would do analog input as far as raw

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.390 
you would do analog input as far as raw
which<00:02:15.560> would<00:02:15.739> be<00:02:17.319> just<00:02:18.319> raw<00:02:18.500> data<00:02:18.770> coming<00:02:19.160> in

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
which would be just raw data coming in

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.240 
which would be just raw data coming in
from<00:02:19.670> your<00:02:19.850> sensor<00:02:20.440> analog<00:02:21.440> incorrect<00:02:22.010> that

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
from your sensor analog incorrect that

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.490 
from your sensor analog incorrect that
would<00:02:22.430> be<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:23.239> the<00:02:23.450> scaling<00:02:23.930> factors<00:02:24.350> that

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
would be you the scaling factors that

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.620 
would be you the scaling factors that
you<00:02:24.620> would<00:02:24.739> enter<00:02:24.890> for<00:02:25.489> your<00:02:25.519> sensor<00:02:26.120> to<00:02:26.390> read

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
you would enter for your sensor to read

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.630 
you would enter for your sensor to read
like<00:02:26.930> instead<00:02:27.470> of<00:02:27.590> reading<00:02:27.769> a<00:02:27.950> voltage<00:02:28.370> for

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
like instead of reading a voltage for

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.520 
like instead of reading a voltage for
example<00:02:28.670> your<00:02:29.600> wideband<00:02:29.989> would<00:02:30.200> read<00:02:30.380> an

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
example your wideband would read an
