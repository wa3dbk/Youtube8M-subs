00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.330
Hi guys FOG of GAMING here and welcome to
part one of our Ultimate Sniper Guide.

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.750
We are going to show you everything that you
need to know to become the perfect sniper

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:20.550
in Battlefield 4, Battlefield Hardline, or
in any other Battlefield game for that matter.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.150
Most of the footage will come from Battlefield
Hardline but almost every tip and trick is

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.109
also valid for Battlefield 4.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:31.410
We are going to create a series of videos
where we will show you everything from the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.110
basics to some pretty advanced stuff.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.630
This is another community request and we will
give you all the tips, even the ones that

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.090
nobody want to share.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.809
We will show you which sniper rifles to start
with and which ones to use when you become

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:45.989
better at sniping.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.270
We will cover all the scopes, attachments
and the optimum settings.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.119
We are even going to try to teach you how
to kill drivers and helicopter pilots.

00:00:56.119 --> 00:01:00.850
Imagine that you are a beginner, or that you
are a veteran player who is good at killing

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.019
people with automatic guns but you don’t
really know how to dominate with a sniper

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.019
rifle.

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:10.100
If this is the case, then this Ultimate Sniper
Guide is for you.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.570
This is part one so we are going to start
with the basics.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.500
Now where do you start?

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.970
A team deathmatch server?

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:18.970
Bloodmoney?

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.030
Maybe even a game of Heist?

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.759
Eum no, hold your horses soldier!

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.689
You’re not ready to fight yet!

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.020
Would you go to war without knowing how to
aim?

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.340
I didn’t think so.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:32.770
The most important thing that I can tell you
is that you can easily train yourself to get

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.190
better at sniping.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.740
Now how do you do that?

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.079
It all starts with your settings.

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.549
Basically you need to get used to a specific
setup that suits you.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.560
And then when you play another game, you need
to take those setting with you.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.000
It doesn’t matter if you are playing on
the PC, Playstation or XBOX.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.509
This is valid for all platforms.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:54.869
You need to build your muscle memory.

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.439
There is a nice definition about muscle memory
on google, they speak about motor learning

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.450
and procedural memory and stuff.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.219
But basically muscle memory is going to allow
you to kill faster in every game that you

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:07.219
play.

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:08.570
That’s what matters right?

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.630
All the pro players are doing it.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.240
And after this video you will be doing this
as well.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.080
We are going to create 2 separate videos.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.150
A settings video for the PC and one for the
Playstation.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.340
The settings for the XBOX are very similar
so the Playstation video will cover that as

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.340
well.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.750
You only have to watch the one that applies
to you.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.099
Or you can watch both of them if you play
on multiple platforms like me.

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.430
Everything what I told you until now will
be the same for both videos so the important

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.310
stuff for your platform starts from here.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.710
If you are playing on the PC.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.900
Got to your mouse settings.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.530
So go to control panel, click on mouse and
then click on pointer options.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.250
Put your pointer speed exactly in the middle
between slow and fast.

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.360
This will give you 100% mouse accuracy.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.470
Make sure that enhance pointer precision is
unchecked because this will cause acceleration

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.560
and this will mess up your aim.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.150
This is a basic setup for everyone.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.810
The only thing that you need to change yourself
is your DPI.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.030
This is very personal.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.520
I can’t recommend a setting because it all
depends on yourself, the resolution of your

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.090
monitor and a whole bunch of other things.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:20.329
You will need to experiment on this one.

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.230
The best tip that we can give you is to lower
your DPI if you don’t have enough precision.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.519
If you need more speed then increase your
DPI.

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.049
I will share my settings later on in this
video but don’t get fixated on this.

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.250
These are my personal settings taking everything
into account that affects my gameplay.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.780
The last thing that you should change is the
polling rate between your mouse and your pc,

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:43.780
if you have a wireless mouse off course.

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.250
Use the highest setting.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.960
The faster that your mouse reports back to
your PC, the more precise your movement will

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.960
be.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.140
It will drain your battery faster but it will
be worth it.

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.019
There are a bunch of other things that you
can change but most of them don’t matter

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.519
that much so we are not going to cover them.

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.569
You are going to want to change a few things
in game as well.

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.550
Start with setting your Raw Mouse Input to
ON because this will make your mouse more

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:09.689
accurate.

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.790
It does exactly what it says, it will take
the raw mouse input.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.230
If for some reason there is a setting enabled
on your PC that affects your mouse, then this

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:20.079
will bypass that setting.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:25.000
The next thing that you should do it to turn
ON Uniform Soldier Aiming.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.890
There is a very complicated and detailed way
to explain this but still, it is very difficult

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:31.080
to understand.

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.140
The easiest way to explain this is to say
that every scope magnification that you use

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.140
will feel natural.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.270
It doesn’t only feel natural, it will even
help you to build muscle memory.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:45.570
That is all you need to know about Uniform
Soldier Aiming.

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.060
Before you turn on this button, you need to
make sure that your soldier zoom sensitivity

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.190
is set to 100%.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:57.020
Then go to advanced options and make sure
that all your soldier zoom sensitivities are

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.630
set to 100%, and that the Uniform Soldier
Aiming coefficient is set to 133%.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.930
Now you may turn ON Uniform Soldier Aiming.

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:12.120
These settings are the basic settings that
everyone should use because this will allow

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.320
you to build your muscle memory.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.010
In other words it will improve your reflexes,
which improves your aim.

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:22.090
And you can take these settings with you to
other games.

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:26.800
There are websites that calculate which settings
you should use when you start playing a different

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.800
game.

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.370
Just google for them, they are very easy to
find.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.380
The very last thing that you have to change
now is your own soldier mouse sensitivity.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.520
This is personal.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.100
There are no good or bad settings because
it all depends on you.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:45.290
If something feels unnatural then try to use
the soldier mouse sensitivity and adjust everything

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.290
that way.

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:50.890
Don’t use the other sensitivity settings
unless you really have to, only do this as

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.370
a last resort.

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.540
But for most people this won’t be necessary.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.540
I will give you my settings just for info.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.460
Feel free to use them, but you don’t have
to because these settings are personal.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:11.550
I have my DPI set at 1800 and my in game sensitivity
to 25 percent and I play on a 1080p monitor.

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.970
There is one last tip that we are going to
give you and that is to get rid of the Chat

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.920
log, the Kill Log and Battlelog In-Game.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.470
Just hide all of them because they are not
there to improve your game.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:24.440
They will only distract you.

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.510
This video is part 1 of a series.

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:31.270
So make sure that you catch the other ones
as well to become a better sniper.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:51.370
This was FOG of GAMING, thanks for watching
and see you on the Battlefield!
