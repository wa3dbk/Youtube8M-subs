00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.610 
hey guys I'm doing another video on how
to<00:00:04.460> change<00:00:05.030> out<00:00:05.420> your<00:00:06.070> differential<00:00:07.070> oil<00:00:08.620> okay

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:09.620 
to change out your differential oil okay

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.350 
to change out your differential oil okay
these<00:00:09.860> are<00:00:10.040> the<00:00:10.070> tools<00:00:10.340> that<00:00:10.490> I'll<00:00:11.030> be<00:00:11.330> using

wrench this is the oil you'll be
replacing<00:00:44.120> I<00:00:44.629> got<00:00:45.050> this<00:00:45.230> at<00:00:45.820> infinity<00:00:47.620> and

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
replacing I got this at infinity and

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.950 
replacing I got this at infinity and
it's<00:00:49.219> the<00:00:49.690> ATW

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
it's the ATW

eight bucks in a pan I'm going to show
you<00:01:11.170> where<00:01:12.170> the<00:01:12.410> hex<00:01:13.010> screw<00:01:13.990> is<00:01:14.990> gonna<00:01:15.200> go<00:01:15.380> in

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:16.690 
you where the hex screw is gonna go in

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:23.020 
you where the hex screw is gonna go in
I'm<00:01:17.690> gonna<00:01:17.840> go<00:01:18.140> down<00:01:21.280> okay<00:01:22.280> so<00:01:22.340> when<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.880> go

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.460 
down you're gonna see here's your
differential<00:01:32.590> right<00:01:33.590> there<00:01:35.050> that's<00:01:36.050> one<00:01:36.320> of

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
differential right there that's one of

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.740 
differential right there that's one of
the<00:01:37.540> hex<00:01:39.730> it's<00:01:40.730> gonna<00:01:40.850> fit<00:01:41.150> in<00:01:41.330> there

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
the hex it's gonna fit in there

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.920 
the hex it's gonna fit in there
that's<00:01:42.380> your<00:01:42.680> drain<00:01:42.980> and<00:01:44.410> on<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:45.650> side<00:01:46.930> right

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
that's your drain and on the side right

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.710 
that's your drain and on the side right
there

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
there
