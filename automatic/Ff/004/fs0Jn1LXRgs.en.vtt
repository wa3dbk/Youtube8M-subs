 always when you kill a zombie and such 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.820

 eat it there actually started time 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.900
 because when they added the 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.879
 probability of you eating and you do not 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.790
 to be poisoned right? 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.640

 When 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.819
 my flesh you get poisoned then 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:51.250

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.560
 run Run 

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:15.100
 whoa it takes to lose food 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:18.370
 Face my god of the sky and faith that I 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.180
 I'm not in the hard pictures of the days at psiu or at 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.340
 ise 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.530
 Look at this, it takes a long time, not good people. 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.380
 to do so I'm going to cut a 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:29.230
 When they lose the food, I'll be back. 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.150
 here then already van beauty i'm already now 

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.470

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.020
 people go with three lost people 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.770
 can you run more simply walk 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.570
 and jump 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:39.580
 so let's eat if you close flash that 

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:43.900
 predict how much regeneration you have seen 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:46.210
 regenerates little but an email but it is not 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.760
 the most important is not flash 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:52.030
 most importantly important flash 

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:55.300
 It's the zombie steak what's this we're going to have 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:59.530
 that the cooked sumbe beef face is there 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:02.980
 Yes, this one is going to regenerate a lot 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:05.770
 Let's put the opa and drugs here. 

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:09.910
 angola to the fesf flash and let's go 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:14.950
 place an entire part here for the 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:16.930
 beauty will see that what will come out of this 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.960
 shape this guy let's see let's see 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.210
 Let's see what will happen, I guess. 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:26.290
 who will see the men take looks only came 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:28.720
 a steak beauty now let's eat these 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:33.820
 men take let's see what they are seeing 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:35.590
 there is missing 12345 né 56 look just look at the 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.670
 so much that it regenerates 

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:42.960
 You realize you regenerate four tires 

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:46.900
 4 guys so it's very important 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:48.730
 is something like that minecraft because 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.730
 are so many foods that regenerate 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:54.910
 rather né the bread for example regenerates 3 

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:58.060
 the apple regenerates less then it is expensive it is 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:07:00.850
 very important you have in your mini 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:03.670
 crash foods that regenerate fairly 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:06.400
 because we can eat a 

00:07:03.670 --> 00:07:09.820
 big now we can eat zombie 

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:10.449
 and the zombie is a fucking thing is easy 

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.930
 You find 

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:15.969
 It's just you wait at night and it's there. 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:20.620
 for you to walk with food with meat unb 

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:23.499
 It's cooked and that's how you'll get it. 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.460
 in case the region was easier it is just 

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:26.860
 food etc 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.360
 to helena so this is a way for today 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:30.669
