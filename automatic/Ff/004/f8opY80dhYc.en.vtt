okay<00:00:06.900> Carl<00:00:07.880> this<00:00:08.880> is<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.590> logical<00:00:10.590> conundrum<00:00:11.340> to

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:11.760 
okay Carl this is a logical conundrum to

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.760 
okay Carl this is a logical conundrum to
a<00:00:12.570> certain<00:00:12.900> extent<00:00:13.260> there's<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.469> little<00:00:13.650> bit<00:00:13.740> of

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770 
a certain extent there's a little bit of

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.440 
a certain extent there's a little bit of
lateral<00:00:14.010> thinking<00:00:14.459> because<00:00:14.760> sir<00:00:14.969> but<00:00:15.330> there

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
lateral thinking because sir but there

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.130 
lateral thinking because sir but there
is<00:00:15.539> only<00:00:15.690> one<00:00:16.049> right<00:00:16.710> answer<00:00:16.950> and<00:00:17.340> now<00:00:18.330> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
is only one right answer and now the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.050 
is only one right answer and now the
pressure<00:00:19.410> isn't<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.890> get<00:00:20.010> this<00:00:20.130> right<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
pressure isn't to get this right the

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.570 
pressure isn't to get this right the
pressure<00:00:21.359> is<00:00:21.890> when<00:00:22.890> I've<00:00:23.009> told<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
pressure is when I've told you the

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.339 
pressure is when I've told you the
answer<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.179> then<00:00:24.330> understand<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.019> because

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
answer to then understand it because

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:26.810 
answer to then understand it because
I've<00:00:25.500> stood<00:00:25.679> up<00:00:25.800> when<00:00:25.949> I've<00:00:26.070> explained<00:00:26.640> this

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
that's deal it's a leap of imagination

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.520 
that's deal it's a leap of imagination
here<00:01:28.530> and<00:01:29.340> I've<00:01:30.150> definitely<00:01:30.480> got<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> ones<00:01:31.230> I've

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
have a feel of the door to see if

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.750 
have a feel of the door to see if
there's<00:01:35.100> any<00:01:35.220> heat<00:01:35.400> or<00:01:35.640> anything<00:01:37.760> they're

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
identical you stand a few yards away you

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.290 
identical you stand a few yards away you
cannot<00:01:41.159> tell<00:01:41.400> from<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.700> outside<00:01:41.729> of<00:01:42.210> these

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
cannot tell from the outside of these

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.000 
cannot tell from the outside of these
doors<00:01:42.360> which<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.900> which<00:01:43.080> what<00:01:43.530> question<00:01:43.950> do

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
doors which is which what question do

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.950 
doors which is which what question do
you<00:01:44.070> ask<00:01:44.330> can't<00:01:45.330> look<00:01:45.420> through<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> keyhole

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
you ask can't look through the keyhole

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.610 
you ask can't look through the keyhole
or<00:01:46.140> anything

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
or anything

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.930 
or anything
there's<00:01:46.979> no<00:01:47.130> KL<00:01:47.520> any<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.880> them<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:50.310> let's

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
there's no KL any of them and let's

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.190 
there's no KL any of them and let's
imagine<00:01:51.120> there's<00:01:51.390> a<00:01:51.420> small<00:01:51.659> rope<00:01:51.930> that

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
imagine there's a small rope that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.420 
imagine there's a small rope that
prevents<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.680> from<00:01:52.740> getting<00:01:53.010> anywhere<00:01:53.310> near

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
prevents you from getting anywhere near
