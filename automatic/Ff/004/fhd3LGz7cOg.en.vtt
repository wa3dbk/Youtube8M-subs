00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.350
 little forza motorsport everybody 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.179
 asked me to record some 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.950
 run unfortunately has no game 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.250
 race on pc then gives to make a 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.650
 super complete video but how does it have strength? 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.020
 either force 3 or force 4 has the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.680
 possibility of exporting images and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.990
 videos 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.119
 so I ended up taking some 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.880
 photos and a few videos that is a 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:30.480
 export console video bag 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.090
 Thank God there is xbox one so much xbox 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.010
 as the ps4 will bring the possibility 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.570
 recording with the ground then I go 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.750

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.059

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.950

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.170
 of balls that I made of indian wells by 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.760
 example moments do not cry 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.340
 but unfortunately it is not possible though 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.899
 for who likes racing game the force is 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.850
 possible to export at least some 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.219
 thing then bringing a little video to 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.859
 You now start with the photos and 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.370

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.750

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.979

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.159
 moments form motorsport that are very 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.340

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.140
 truth, coming back here a little bit is a 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.479
 of a car is the power 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.930

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.550
 he shakes a triplex that the drawing in the 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.770
 side would fit in the field that 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:21.340
 It's really cool, it's just an astonishment. 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.110
