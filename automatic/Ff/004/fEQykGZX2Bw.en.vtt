under<00:01:16.860> which<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.640> grown<00:01:18.479> man<00:01:18.720> could<00:01:19.049> could<00:01:19.680> be

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
under which a grown man could could be

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.100 
under which a grown man could could be
it<00:01:20.009> could<00:01:20.340> be<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:21.030> could<00:01:21.390> dress<00:01:21.600> up<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.960> like

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
it could be I could dress up and like

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.289 
it could be I could dress up and like
pretty<00:01:22.320> think<00:01:22.680> he's<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.830> character<00:01:23.250> so<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.119> made

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
pretty think he's a character so I made

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.690 
pretty think he's a character so I made
up<00:01:24.330> this<00:01:24.420> story<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:25.619> then<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:26.250> started

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.850 
immediately it done what I was asked to
do<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.120> didn't<00:02:12.390> show<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.660> for<00:02:13.290> the<00:02:13.349> last<00:02:13.530> two

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
do and I didn't show it for the last two

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.759 
do and I didn't show it for the last two
years<00:02:14.099> actually<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:15.150> think<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.470> think<00:02:16.500> it

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
years actually I think and I think it

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.319 
years actually I think and I think it
was<00:02:16.860> mostly<00:02:17.130> because<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.459> the<00:02:17.610> popularity<00:02:18.090> of

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:18.329 
was mostly because of the popularity of

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:19.550 
was mostly because of the popularity of
