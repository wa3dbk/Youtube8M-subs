00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.529
 hello today i will tell you about 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.689
 how to care for problem 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:23.430
 skin 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:25.900
 Of course to get rid of acne you need 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.570
 take care of the skin not only outside but 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:32.619
 and cleanse the body from the inside but we are today 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:35.020
 we will not talk about this so the first 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.820
 how to start on caring for 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.270
 problem skin is proper cleansing 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.790
 skin 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.750
 skin needs to be cleansed not just with water so 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:49.739
 water does not cleanse the skin enough 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.640
 make-up from dirt from cornified 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.540
 skin cells and not soap as soap 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.909
 over dry skin and 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.820
 not enough, too, cleans it from 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:07.060
 makeup and impurities need to be cleansed 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.920
 I will take a good cleanser 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.460
 This case is such a cleansing 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:16.530
 means and we put a small amount 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.530
 it on a cotton pad 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.890
 and in circular motions 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:34.149
 on the massage lines of the face she is 17 more often 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:34.149
 happily 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.570
 then wash off warm 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:06.210
 This tool does not tighten the skin very 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.320
 gently removes impurities from the skin 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.210
 next tool we are today 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.480
 will use 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:18.850
 This mask is such a mask deep 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.040
 cleansing mask penetrate the pores of the skin 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.270
 effectively cleans the skin from pollution 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.680
 removes excess sebum 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.680
 then eliminates black dots 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.430
 those who suffer from black dots 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.430
 recommend 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.640
 we put it on the skin of Moscow rubbed 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.660
 apply and smear on the skin 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:16.330
 and leave it somewhere 15 dogs on face 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:20.820
 so our mask has dried up 

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:23.130
 can be washed off with warm water can be removed 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.750
 towel with powerful water 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.020
 use such a brain is two or three 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:32.890
 times a week but if you want quick 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:36.490
 and a good result is a sharp start so 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.110
 let's say you can use for example i 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:44.040
 during the week every day she doesn't 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:44.040
 hurts the skin and remove it from the face 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.140
 next tool that we are with you 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.160
 will use this tonic well or 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:04.430
 toner 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.400
 differently some toners and in tonic 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.600
 it is necessary to use not 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.050
 alcohol-containing alcohol as contain 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.490
 that does not impersonally dry out the skin and 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.450
 promotes peeling and assets and 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:22.160
 active 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:24.389
 sebum therefore take not 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.870
 alcohol tonic i use here 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.870
 so here 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.080
 and 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.569
 on a small amount of it on us and on 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:37.529
 cotton pad here 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:37.529
 and wipe the skin 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:46.210
 along the massage lines as always 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:49.389
 tonic and helps to remove 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:53.099
 remnants of mask residues from the skin 

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:53.099
 tap water residue 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.460
 contributes to the narrowing of pores 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.870
 prepares the skin for active 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.870
 absorption 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:13.950
 cosmetics that we will 

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:15.840
 for tonic applied on face 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.480
 and the last resort on which today 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.940
 i will use this cream cream for 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:26.490
 face skin and eye cream 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.680
 Here are the cream you need cream 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:31.320
 use necessarily as they don't 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.440
 only nourishes the skin but also protects it 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:37.210
 given face cream he with sunscreen 

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:42.669
 success factor 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:47.280
 15 of seemingly do not know the invisible genus from 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:47.280
 such a cream is moisturizing the skin 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.360
 light texture 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:56.310
 do not apply on the skin 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.310
 instantly and tung does not make the skin shine 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.430
 cream 

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:12.960
 and last resort that we are today 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:15.289
 which is used with you some 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.289
 close 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.950
 the same mascara around the eyes can 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.280
 look after 

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.010
 since the first machines image is formed at 

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.640
 us exactly 

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:29.380
 Here's this about-face 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.720
 cooling 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.490
 Gel put on these fingers necessarily 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:36.849
 because they play and are 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.909
 non-working fingers our hands 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:43.400
 and unnecessary skin is not stretched and accurate 

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:46.160
 movement around the eyes 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:49.800
 we put 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.690
 Our grandfather also recommend this gel for 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:55.110
 those who very often sit at the computer 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:58.229
 as it relieves irritation and 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:07:02.130
 eye fatigue relieves excessive swelling 

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:04.850
 ost around the eyes and dark circles under 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.850
 eyes 

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:14.810
 so let's summarize, I think in any case 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:19.310
 if you want to succeed you need not 

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:20.900
 be lazy and if you decide to care and 

00:07:19.310 --> 00:07:23.180
 their course to achieve some results 

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:27.260
 then you need to do it day after day and not 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:31.190
 be lazy I hope you like my 

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:33.820
 video color look quotes just 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.820
 good 

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.320
 and
