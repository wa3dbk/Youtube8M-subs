 the genre of magical realism you know what I 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.610
 I can guess Yandex can 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.409
 to decipher 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.670
 first time this term in relation 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:09.080
 peter round was applied already in 1931 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:12.049
 to some french critics but the point is 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.360
 that magical realism rests on 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.490
 such fine lines of the world as his 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.659
 unusual some surrealism 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.729
 some kind of magic magic ie those 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.979
 features of our world which can 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.689
 lean sings writer artist that is 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.490
 some kind of changed a little real 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.030
 something fantastic than you can write 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:34.609
 create that excites us imagination and 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.039
 yes and inspires us inspires 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:39.590
 feats dear friends in this book 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.899
 specifically a hundred years of loneliness is 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.759
 moments that go beyond our 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:46.280
 Sydney perception I know that there 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.229
 magic house was that is an idea came to 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.299
 to the writer when he visited his house where 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.460
 he grew up and he seemed to him very 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.039
 little books like books 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.439
 tells the story of how a house turns out 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:59.329
 big not childhood on miller least 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.399
 growing up he becomes small and 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:04.460
 accordingly the author wants to punish what 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.679
 thinks and living being that grows 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.750
 changes tapers there becomes evil 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.490
 or kind depending on who he is 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.590
 lives probably tusyat those people 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.080
 who live in the afternoon but in general probably one 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.580
 of the most epic books that I read 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.380
 some particular moment of your life 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.590
 because I used to love science fiction 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.540
 I read this book and I think 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.090
 I will read was a long time ago probably 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.720
 I was 15 may 18 but I could not 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.790
 come off 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.330
 I have it all gone I read read 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.340
 I read that until I read it struck that 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.530
 slowly and very smoothly bailiff they 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.930
 what is even poetic means how 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.730
 the ball coils slowly and smoothly then 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.269
 there is at first a little pack all the more 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.260
 and more 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.670
 tells about a certain family about 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.099
 even generations of this family 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.900
 how she started this family and how 

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:53.420
 proper hot all of her life cycle 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.790
 ended the plot smoothly gaining momentum 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.700
 but it’s really smooth 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.620
 it is felt physically people live like u 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.239
 they are born children like they have some 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.459
 relationship goes with a certain 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.620
 other people like they have some kind there 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:08.569
 learn incest some inside is not really 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.269
 family some family to flow in for example 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:17.239
 the girl who loved the earth like them 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:32.959
 struggling with this task as watched 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:34.790
 when i love the whole clan and with that 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.829
 there are many names and very 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.870
 similar yes there was no such feeling 

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:41.540
 so read because when something 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.670
 already the case itself happens there constantly 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.859
 there is an action 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:48.230
 That's it fascinating and amaze 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.840
 interesting all the time all the time all 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.750
 time here it goes on going all marquis he 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:56.060
 despite the fact that it seems like he recently 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.239
 died by the way in april of that davyd in this 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.690
 year he died at his end 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.480
 eighties found lung cancer he smoked 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:06.950
 Up to 3 packs while working but it seemed to be 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.079
 the operation was cured 

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.269
 but not passed there 5 years in my opinion again 

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:13.790
 some sort of something else 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.650
 Muck two operations again did one 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.260
 mexico one in america again he's somehow 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.780
 miraculously survived and he did a good job 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:22.700
 literally 20 years and by the end he is already 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.340
 according to brother need and what are you his 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.470
 give up he has dementia 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:30.110
 here and here nevertheless I think from something 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.060
 fine in early april but here's the 18th 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.070
 April from the lowest and this year's tuner was 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.050
 declared a three-day mourning in general he 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.090
 even won the Nobel Prize despite 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.040
 on the fact that his book she has a lot of story 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.360
 the stories of the pharamant her so much 

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.669
 literally seven or eight 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.350
 let's click already to wrap it up why 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:47.479
