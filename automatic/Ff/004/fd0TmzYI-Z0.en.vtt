00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
probably have never even used this

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.870 
probably have never even used this
attachment<00:01:16.020> or<00:01:16.830> never<00:01:17.130> even<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.580> know<00:01:17.670> really

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
attachment or never even you know really

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.340 
attachment or never even you know really
thought<00:01:18.150> about<00:01:18.270> using<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:18.960> actually<00:01:19.290> a

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
thought about using it it's actually a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.140 
thought about using it it's actually a
pretty<00:01:19.710> bad<00:01:19.950> attachment<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.580> be<00:01:20.700> honest<00:01:21.030> you

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
pretty bad attachment to be honest you

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.820 
pretty bad attachment to be honest you
can<00:01:21.299> get<00:01:21.420> up<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.659> like<00:01:21.780> six<00:01:22.140> hit<00:01:22.350> markers<00:01:22.680> i

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
can get up to like six hit markers i

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.160 
can get up to like six hit markers i
think<00:01:23.040> with<00:01:23.189> this<00:01:23.310> thing<00:01:23.520> and<00:01:24.020> although<00:01:25.020> it

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
think with this thing and although it

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.260 
think with this thing and although it
has<00:01:25.320> you<00:01:25.619> know<00:01:25.650> like<00:01:26.220> two<00:01:26.460> times<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.909> range<00:01:27.119> of

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
has you know like two times the range of

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.060 
has you know like two times the range of
a<00:01:27.360> normal<00:01:27.600> shotgun<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.290> really<00:01:28.560> weak<00:01:28.890> i

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
a normal shotgun it's really weak i

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.399 
a normal shotgun it's really weak i
think<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.400> only<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:30.000> takes<00:01:30.270> up<00:01:30.479> like<00:01:30.689> 15

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
think it only you know takes up like 15

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.260 
think it only you know takes up like 15
damage<00:01:32.100> at<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> farthest<00:01:32.759> though<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.030> know

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
damage at the farthest though you know

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.999 
damage at the farthest though you know
you<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.780> be<00:01:33.900> pretty<00:01:34.079> weak<00:01:34.320> i<00:01:34.439> think<00:01:34.680> there's

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
you can be pretty weak i think there's

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.490 
you can be pretty weak i think there's
an<00:01:35.250> example<00:01:35.670> here<00:01:36.020> coming<00:01:37.020> up<00:01:37.110> where<00:01:37.259> i<00:01:37.320> get

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
an example here coming up where i get

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.710 
an example here coming up where i get
like<00:01:37.619> three<00:01:37.979> hit<00:01:38.100> markers<00:01:38.430> on<00:01:38.579> a<00:01:38.610> guy<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.210> it's

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
like three hit markers on a guy and it's

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.170 
like three hit markers on a guy and it's
pretty<00:01:39.930> close<00:01:40.170> a<00:01:40.500> pretty<00:01:41.369> close<00:01:41.579> range<00:01:41.880> and

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
pretty close a pretty close range and

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.149 
pretty close a pretty close range and
you<00:01:42.840> know<00:01:42.930> it<00:01:43.049> doesn't<00:01:43.200> even<00:01:43.409> kill<00:01:43.950> him<00:01:44.070> or

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
you know it doesn't even kill him or

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.069 
you know it doesn't even kill him or
anything<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.909> guys<00:01:45.600> will<00:01:45.810> see<00:01:45.840> what<00:01:46.049> i

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
anything so you guys will see what i

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.289 
anything so you guys will see what i
mean<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.500> also<00:01:47.189> i<00:01:47.250> use<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> china<00:01:47.850> lake<00:01:48.060> which

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
mean and also i use the china lake which

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.600 
mean and also i use the china lake which
is<00:01:48.329> actually<00:01:48.659> pretty<00:01:49.110> bad<00:01:49.380> launcher<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.490> be

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
is actually pretty bad launcher to be

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.639 
is actually pretty bad launcher to be
honest<00:01:50.939> and<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.180> think<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:51.540> unlocked<00:01:51.990> the

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
honest and I think it's unlocked the

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.730 
honest and I think it's unlocked the
last<00:01:52.890> launcher<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.399> unlock<00:01:54.380> in<00:01:55.380> my<00:01:55.500> opinion

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
last launcher to unlock in my opinion

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.190 
last launcher to unlock in my opinion
the<00:01:56.159> launchers<00:01:57.149> are<00:01:57.299> actually<00:01:57.689> underpowered

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
the launchers are actually underpowered

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.499 
the launchers are actually underpowered
in<00:01:58.500> this<00:01:58.619> game<00:01:58.829> when<00:01:59.790> you<00:01:59.909> look<00:02:00.060> at<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> china

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
in this game when you look at the china

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.109 
in this game when you look at the china
lake<00:02:00.689> maybe<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.140> RPG<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:02.430> RPG<00:02:02.850> is<00:02:02.909> pretty

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
lake maybe the RPG is the RPG is pretty

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.630 
lake maybe the RPG is the RPG is pretty
well<00:02:03.270> balanced<00:02:03.719> in<00:02:03.780> my<00:02:03.869> opinion<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.549> when<00:02:05.549> you

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
well balanced in my opinion but when you

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.370 
well balanced in my opinion but when you
look<00:02:05.759> at<00:02:05.909> things<00:02:06.210> like<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.630> with<00:02:06.960> like<00:02:07.200> the

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
look at things like the with like the

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.550 
look at things like the with like the
law<00:02:07.890> or<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.780> china<00:02:09.780> lake<00:02:10.020> they're<00:02:10.319> pretty

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
law or the china lake they're pretty

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.290 
law or the china lake they're pretty
underpowered<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.310> then<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.580> Strela<00:02:11.879> 3<00:02:12.150> is

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
underpowered and then the Strela 3 is

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.880 
underpowered and then the Strela 3 is
the<00:02:12.569> show<00:02:13.080> 3<00:02:13.379> is

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
the show 3 is

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.700 
the show 3 is
pretty<00:02:14.280> good<00:02:14.490> pretty<00:02:14.730> well-balanced

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
pretty good pretty well-balanced

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.570 
pretty good pretty well-balanced
considering<00:02:16.710> that<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.920> cannot<00:02:17.160> shoot<00:02:17.340> at

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
considering that you cannot shoot at

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.949 
considering that you cannot shoot at
people<00:02:17.700> but<00:02:17.970> only<00:02:18.030> add<00:02:18.360> air<00:02:18.569> support<00:02:18.930> and

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
people but only add air support and

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:20.630 
people but only add air support and
stuff<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.319> that<00:02:19.380> I<00:02:19.740> think<00:02:20.340> they<00:02:20.430> did<00:02:20.610> a

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
stuff like that I think they did a

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.640 
stuff like that I think they did a
pretty<00:02:20.700> good<00:02:21.000> job<00:02:21.060> other<00:02:21.600> than<00:02:21.630> the<00:02:21.930> Strela<00:02:22.440> I

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
pretty good job other than the Strela I

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.699 
pretty good job other than the Strela I
mean<00:02:22.860> other<00:02:23.069> than<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.310> master<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:25.380> China

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
mean other than the master the China

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.640 
mean other than the master the China
Lake<00:02:26.010> this<00:02:26.790> dude<00:02:27.000> ghost<00:02:27.480> taking<00:02:28.410> out<00:02:28.500> my

Lake this dude ghost taking out my

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.190 
Lake this dude ghost taking out my
sentry<00:02:29.040> gun<00:02:29.330> was<00:02:30.330> pretty<00:02:30.540> upset<00:02:30.870> about<00:02:30.959> that

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
sentry gun was pretty upset about that

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.960 
sentry gun was pretty upset about that
but<00:02:31.410> yeah<00:02:31.530> like<00:02:31.709> I<00:02:31.830> said<00:02:31.860> basically<00:02:32.340> for<00:02:32.760> China

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
but yeah like I said basically for China

you're not going to kill them I get a
lot<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.270> hit<00:02:39.390> markers<00:02:39.660> with<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:39.989> thing<00:02:40.200> I

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
lot of hit markers with this thing I

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.710 
lot of hit markers with this thing I
like<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.470> shoot<00:02:40.739> it<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.100> air<00:02:41.220> randomly<00:02:41.790> and

like to shoot it in the air randomly and

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.960 
like to shoot it in the air randomly and
I<00:02:42.840> like<00:02:42.989> across<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.440> map<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.800> stuff<00:02:43.980> but<00:02:44.910> I

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
I like across the map and stuff but I

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.490 
I like across the map and stuff but I
always<00:02:45.209> end<00:02:45.360> up<00:02:45.420> getting<00:02:45.720> hit<00:02:45.840> markers<00:02:46.170> like<00:02:46.350> I

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
always end up getting hit markers like I

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.550 
always end up getting hit markers like I
said<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:46.890> pretty<00:02:47.100> weak<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:47.600> I<00:02:48.600> think<00:02:49.050> in<00:02:49.380> my

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
said it's pretty weak but I think in my

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.130 
said it's pretty weak but I think in my
opinion<00:02:50.030> probably<00:02:51.030> probably<00:02:51.420> guys<00:02:51.780> will

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
opinion probably probably guys will

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.570 
opinion probably probably guys will
disagree<00:02:52.470> with<00:02:52.680> this<00:02:52.769> a<00:02:52.830> lot<00:02:53.070> but<00:02:53.250> they<00:02:53.400> should

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
disagree with this a lot but they should

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:55.449 
disagree with this a lot but they should
have<00:02:53.670> made<00:02:53.850> this<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.060> little<00:02:54.269> more<00:02:54.390> powerful

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
have made this a little more powerful

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.320 
have made this a little more powerful
considering<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:56.550> get<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.790> at<00:02:56.910> such<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.120> high

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
considering you get it at such a high

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.840 
considering you get it at such a high
level<00:02:57.360> and<00:02:57.900> there's<00:02:58.709> flak<00:02:59.040> jacket<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.640> stuff

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
level and there's flak jacket and stuff

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.930 
level and there's flak jacket and stuff
like<00:03:00.000> that<00:03:00.830> but<00:03:01.830> yeah<00:03:01.980> I<00:03:02.010> actually<00:03:02.340> you<00:03:02.850> know

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
like that but yeah I actually you know

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.190 
like that but yeah I actually you know
I've<00:03:03.030> been<00:03:03.060> using<00:03:03.360> this<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.600> little<00:03:03.840> bit<00:03:04.050> ly

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
I've been using this a little bit ly

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.680 
I've been using this a little bit ly
recently<00:03:04.880> just<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.000> mess<00:03:06.150> around<00:03:06.300> a<00:03:06.570> little

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
recently just to mess around a little

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.979 
recently just to mess around a little
bit<00:03:06.870> and<00:03:07.140> it's<00:03:07.410> actually<00:03:07.739> pretty<00:03:07.860> fun<00:03:08.130> so

really recommend these things this this

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.180

master<00:04:12.150> keys<00:04:12.329> piece<00:04:12.570> of<00:04:12.720> crap<00:04:12.930> to<00:04:13.590> be<00:04:13.950> quite

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
master keys piece of crap to be quite

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.940 
master keys piece of crap to be quite
honest<00:04:14.549> and<00:04:14.820> you<00:04:15.660> know<00:04:15.780> even<00:04:15.810> with<00:04:16.380> scavenger

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
honest and you know even with scavenger

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.190 
honest and you know even with scavenger
it<00:04:17.100> doesn't<00:04:17.400> replenish<00:04:17.880> the<00:04:18.120> shotgun<00:04:18.900> shells

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
it doesn't replenish the shotgun shells

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.820 
it doesn't replenish the shotgun shells
which<00:04:20.010> I<00:04:20.220> think<00:04:20.579> it<00:04:21.239> should<00:04:21.710> you<00:04:22.710> know

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
which I think it should you know

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.490 
which I think it should you know
considering<00:04:23.520> that<00:04:24.270> it<00:04:24.450> basically<00:04:24.690> resupplies

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
considering that it basically resupplies

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.300 
considering that it basically resupplies
everything<00:04:25.950> else<00:04:26.099> but

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
everything else but

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.070 
everything else but
I guess<00:04:27.730> they<00:04:28.030> don't<00:04:28.150> resupply<00:04:28.660> under

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
I guess they don't resupply under

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.480 
I guess they don't resupply under
barrels<00:04:29.440> just<00:04:29.530> like<00:04:29.800> they<00:04:29.919> don't<00:04:30.070> resupply

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
barrels just like they don't resupply

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.909 
barrels just like they don't resupply
the<00:04:30.550> noob<00:04:30.790> tubes<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:31.720> guess<00:04:32.230> unfortunately

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
the noob tubes I guess unfortunately

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:34.700 
the noob tubes I guess unfortunately
they<00:04:33.040> don't<00:04:33.130> resupply<00:04:33.610> the<00:04:33.669> shotgun<00:04:34.270> either

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
they don't resupply the shotgun either

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.230 
they don't resupply the shotgun either
but<00:04:35.710> you<00:04:36.010> know<00:04:36.370> I<00:04:36.400> think<00:04:36.610> they<00:04:36.880> should<00:04:37.090> have

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
but you know I think they should have

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.420 
but you know I think they should have
because<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.750> shotguns<00:04:38.139> weak<00:04:38.320> enough<00:04:38.620> and

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
because the shotguns weak enough and

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.940 
because the shotguns weak enough and
especially<00:04:40.210> with<00:04:40.510> only<00:04:40.930> like<00:04:41.230> 12<00:04:41.470> bullets<00:04:41.680> or

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
especially with only like 12 bullets or

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.129 
especially with only like 12 bullets or
whatever<00:04:42.240> it's<00:04:43.240> pretty<00:04:43.389> much<00:04:43.540> a<00:04:43.600> waste<00:04:43.720> of<00:04:44.020> an

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:44.139 
whatever it's pretty much a waste of an

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:46.890 
whatever it's pretty much a waste of an
