00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
there are several like the parameters

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.519 
there are several like the parameters
for<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.500> lexus<00:00:17.210> so<00:00:18.210> target<00:00:18.660> spotlight<00:00:19.170> and

then you can check shadow on all right

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.310 
then you can check shadow on all right
and<00:00:23.010> then<00:00:23.070> shadow<00:00:23.340> map<00:00:23.730> should<00:00:23.939> be<00:00:24.150> free<00:00:25.080> right

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and then shadow map should be free right

shadow okay so intensely going to be in

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.229 
shadow okay so intensely going to be in
this<00:00:31.830> moment<00:00:32.040> at<00:00:32.279> this<00:00:32.309> moment<00:00:32.640> I'm<00:00:33.000> going<00:00:33.180> to

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
this moment at this moment I'm going to

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.900 
this moment at this moment I'm going to
just<00:00:33.360> apply<00:00:33.660> 3<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:35.570> then<00:00:37.219> this<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.430> important

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
just apply 3 and then this is important

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.880 
just apply 3 and then this is important
things<00:00:39.120> but<00:00:39.540> like<00:00:39.870> parameter<00:00:40.610> so<00:00:41.610> you<00:00:42.480> can<00:00:42.890> add

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
things but like parameter so you can add

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.500 
things but like parameter so you can add
it's<00:00:44.219> just<00:00:44.460> hot<00:00:44.879> spot<00:00:45.360> beam<00:00:45.780> it<00:00:46.530> means<00:00:46.800> like<00:00:47.160> a

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
it's just hot spot beam it means like a

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.130 
it's just hot spot beam it means like a
you<00:00:48.510> can<00:00:48.980> reduce<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.340> range<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.480> hot<00:00:51.750> spot

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
you can reduce the range of a hot spot

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.580 
you can reduce the range of a hot spot
also<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.570> increase<00:00:54.570> the<00:00:54.870> range<00:00:55.079> of<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.440> hot

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
also you can increase the range of a hot

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.729 
also you can increase the range of a hot
spots<00:00:55.980> so<00:00:56.280> in<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.760> time<00:00:57.090> I'm<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
spots so in this time I'm going to

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
spots so in this time I'm going to
reduce<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.949> little<00:00:59.160> bit<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.789> range<00:01:00.210> of<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.570> hot

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
reduce a little bit the range of a hot

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.039 
reduce a little bit the range of a hot
spot<00:01:01.109> and<00:01:01.469> then<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.780> next<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:03.899> can

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
spot and then you can next you can

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.550 
spot and then you can next you can
decrease<00:01:04.530> you<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.129> increase<00:01:05.580> or<00:01:05.790> decrease

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
decrease you can increase or decrease

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.969 
decrease you can increase or decrease
the<00:01:07.560> range<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.750> the<00:01:09.750> fall<00:01:09.990> off<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:11.100> it<00:01:11.340> means<00:01:11.580> um

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
the range of the fall off so it means um

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.249 
the range of the fall off so it means um
from<00:01:13.979> here<00:01:14.430> from<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.180> from<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.540> center<00:01:15.960> to

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
from here from the from the center to

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.550 
from here from the from the center to
hear<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:18.030> area<00:01:18.630> will<00:01:18.869> be<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:19.380> the

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
hear this area will be that the

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.910 
hear this area will be that the
brightest<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:21.119> range<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.200> then<00:01:22.650> from

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
brightest of the range and then from

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.700 
brightest of the range and then from
here<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:23.880> actually<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.570> light<00:01:24.810> will<00:01:25.530> be

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
here to here actually the light will be

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.859 
here to here actually the light will be
defused<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:27.270> if<00:01:27.479> you<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> larger

okay let's go to the front view and then
for<00:01:53.980> this<00:01:54.160> down<00:01:54.430> light<00:01:54.670> i'm<00:01:54.910> going<00:01:55.090> to<00:01:55.150> apply

down lights we in this case I'm going to
select<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.370> instance<00:02:21.880> instead<00:02:22.810> of<00:02:22.990> copy<00:02:23.459> so

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
select the instance instead of copy so

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.320 
select the instance instead of copy so

still<00:02:47.750> need<00:02:47.810> the<00:02:48.680> primary<00:02:49.480> light<00:02:50.480> source<00:02:50.810> on

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
still need the primary light source on

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.640 
still need the primary light source on
the<00:02:51.440> ceiling<00:02:52.239> this<00:02:53.239> fluorescent<00:02:53.989> lights<00:02:54.290> so

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:54.650 
the ceiling this fluorescent lights so

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.270 
the ceiling this fluorescent lights so
I'm<00:02:54.920> going<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.250> add<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:56.360> very<00:02:56.800> light<00:02:57.800> source

00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:58.280 
I'm going to add the very light source

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.440 
I'm going to add the very light source
for<00:02:59.209> this<00:02:59.420> primary<00:03:00.489> fluorescent<00:03:01.489> light<00:03:02.150> on

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
for this primary fluorescent light on

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.250 
for this primary fluorescent light on
the<00:03:02.569> ceiling<00:03:02.930> okay<00:03:03.590> for<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.970> I'm<00:03:05.360> going<00:03:06.140> to

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
the ceiling okay for that I'm going to

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.759 
the ceiling okay for that I'm going to
maximize<00:03:06.830> this<00:03:07.250> left<00:03:07.640> viewport<00:03:08.390> and<00:03:08.769> then

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
maximize this left viewport and then

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:16.390 
maximize this left viewport and then
let's<00:03:09.980> go<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.250> top<00:03:10.580> view<00:03:13.239> this<00:03:14.380> the<00:03:15.400> rectangle

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
let's go to top view this the rectangle

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.850 
let's go to top view this the rectangle
means<00:03:17.200> the<00:03:18.200> rotation<00:03:19.010> of<00:03:19.160> fluorescent<00:03:19.880> light

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
means the rotation of fluorescent light

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.280 
means the rotation of fluorescent light
so<00:03:21.860> from<00:03:22.370> here<00:03:23.050> I'm<00:03:24.050> going<00:03:24.140> to<00:03:25.930> for<00:03:26.930> that<00:03:27.110> I'm

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
so from here I'm going to for that I'm

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.130 
so from here I'm going to for that I'm
going<00:03:27.440> to<00:03:27.530> maximize<00:03:28.040> this<00:03:28.519> left<00:03:29.120> viewport<00:03:29.840> and

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
going to maximize this left viewport and

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.750 
going to maximize this left viewport and
then<00:03:30.530> let's<00:03:30.739> go<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:31.010> tough<00:03:31.459> you<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:33.160> then<00:03:34.160> as

right position this will be in the upper
chur<00:04:47.060> of<00:04:47.270> at<00:04:48.140> war<00:04:48.470> at<00:04:48.980> the<00:04:49.340> ceiling<00:04:51.040> so<00:04:56.380> great

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.650 

I'm<00:05:00.590> going<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:00.889> change<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.940> very<00:05:02.240> light

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
I'm going to change the very light

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.920 
I'm going to change the very light
intensity<00:05:03.410> and<00:05:03.800> some<00:05:04.100> parameters<00:05:04.490> ok<00:05:05.210> so

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
intensity and some parameters ok so

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.689 
intensity and some parameters ok so
let's<00:05:06.199> select<00:05:06.410> light<00:05:06.889> and<00:05:07.220> then<00:05:07.310> let's<00:05:07.460> go<00:05:07.639> to

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:07.699 
let's select light and then let's go to

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:15.129 
let's select light and then let's go to
modify<00:05:08.300> ok<00:05:09.250> then<00:05:12.729> the<00:05:13.729> type<00:05:14.030> web<00:05:14.300> it<00:05:14.449> plain<00:05:14.780> the

modify ok then the type web it plain the

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:18.189 
modify ok then the type web it plain the
same<00:05:15.410> and<00:05:15.680> then<00:05:16.160> the<00:05:16.340> units<00:05:16.760> intensity<00:05:17.630> under

00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 
same and then the units intensity under

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:21.570 
same and then the units intensity under
intensity<00:05:18.919> the<00:05:19.669> unit's<00:05:20.060> going<00:05:20.270> to<00:05:20.540> be

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
intensity the unit's going to be

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:25.719 
intensity the unit's going to be
luminance<00:05:22.660> ok<00:05:23.919> luminance<00:05:24.919> and<00:05:25.220> then<00:05:25.610> the

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:25.729 
luminance ok luminance and then the

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:30.010 
luminance ok luminance and then the
color<00:05:26.060> will<00:05:26.330> be<00:05:26.510> white<00:05:27.470> ok<00:05:28.460> and<00:05:28.729> a<00:05:29.449> multiplier

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 
color will be white ok and a multiplier

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.280 
color will be white ok and a multiplier
it<00:05:30.800> means<00:05:31.220> intensity<00:05:32.090> so<00:05:32.479> I'm<00:05:32.780> going<00:05:33.710> to<00:05:33.740> input

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:35.290 
it means intensity so I'm going to input

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:40.690 
it means intensity so I'm going to input
20,000<00:05:36.430> ok<00:05:37.430> and<00:05:37.930> then<00:05:38.930> let's<00:05:39.500> check<00:05:39.889> cast

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:40.700 
20,000 ok and then let's check cast

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.280 
20,000 ok and then let's check cast
shadow<00:05:41.090> and<00:05:41.479> then<00:05:42.169> being<00:05:42.530> invisible<00:05:43.630> and<00:05:44.630> then

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
shadow and then being invisible and then

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.500 
shadow and then being invisible and then
let's<00:05:45.560> uncheck<00:05:45.970> effect<00:05:46.970> reflections<00:05:47.780> ok
