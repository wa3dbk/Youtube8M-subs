00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
that way I suspect that's one that's

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.270 
that way I suspect that's one that's
very<00:01:36.810> difficult<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.320> work<00:01:37.439> I<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:37.740> think<00:01:38.100> there

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
very difficult to work I do think there

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.990 
very difficult to work I do think there
are<00:01:38.430> areas<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.820> influence<00:01:39.119> on<00:01:40.670> that<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.820> could

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
are areas of influence on that we could

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.530 
are areas of influence on that we could
argue<00:01:42.299> about<00:01:42.420> who<00:01:42.810> has<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.079> most<00:01:44.240> but<00:01:45.240> but

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
argue about who has the most but but

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.469 
argue about who has the most but but
probably<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.079> usual<00:01:46.229> suspects<00:01:46.979> you<00:01:47.549> know<00:01:47.700> who

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
probably the usual suspects you know who

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.289 
probably the usual suspects you know who
