00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 Hello and yes, of course you have again 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.819
 switched on 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.379
 I'll show you six simple and one today 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.799
 also very fast hairstyles for the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.799
 everyday life 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.190
 Today I say the boring hairstyles 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.880
 have a fight and show you mine 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.560
 six favorite hairstyles for everyday life 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.779
 for the first hairstyle we need completely 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.490
 just a hair gum and a 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.890
 Hairbrush I'll show you now 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.289
 the neck helped down chop because the one 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.780
 Lately is very popular and also 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.370
 Currently my favorite hairstyle is to 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
 I just take with my two 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.960
 thumb the top shop of mine 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.950
 hair and make me so high 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.379
 sitting ponytail with that there 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.300
 front not so flat there is loose 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.920
 I keep it up a bit and then 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.570
 the hairstyle is already finished me 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.910
 think it's really nice because it's on 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.039
 there is a bit of volume behind and 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.090
 The hair is not quite whole 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.090
 lying there boring 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.280
 for the second hairstyle I separate mine 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.670
 Hair about ears higher in two 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.930
 make lots of parties from the top party 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.149
 I get a high-heeled 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.700
 ponytail I now with one 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.110
 fix hair gum and so you too 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.720
 I can really see what I am doing here 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:33.119
 I 'll stick you with one 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:35.369
 bracket up from the bottom of the 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.560
 Hair now plait a plait 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.310
 and so he goes upstairs 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.310
 is braided 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.840
 when I'm done with it then really 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.330
 the end of a high-sitting 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.070
 ponytail and would that then in mine 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.620
 hair elastic into it so it also holds well 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.750
 So I do not need any bobby pins 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:02.730
 and the whole thing looks pretty neat 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.540
 that is just in the now 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.640
 ponytail 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:09.149
 but if you look closely then you see 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:13.070
 this cute job down there and still 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.070
 then this is a special hairstyle 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.060
 when I invite for home 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.190
 I want to, and it's going pretty fast 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.320
 then it looks like this but that is 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.000
 Of course not nice and we have to 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:33.180
 do it differently with it a little bit more 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.670
 gets volume and for that I will 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.770
 just pluck up my hair so the 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.020
 Whole hair just wrong around 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.280
 So do that pretty much 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.280
 has a lot of volume 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.220
 and then I'll make it easy 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:56.710
 a bush and I look that one 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:03:00.280
 loop out of it so arises as it 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.110
 but we can see that here 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.270
 as of course not so can still be 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.940
 not very good but now 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.130
 we need a lot of bobby pins then 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.620
 We will fix the braid now 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:15.270
 that makes it a pretty voluminous and 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.270
 big bushes are made of it 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.799
 for the fourth hairstyle we need quite 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.959
 just a hair band 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.670
 you can take any other hair band 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.250
 but I like that best 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.290
 and I'll just say that 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.810
 Crest came out so I just 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:50.360
 have no crest and then 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.970
 I give my hair band under mine 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.269
 Put your hair in and push it over mine 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.560
 ears out 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:59.000
 You could do it now, too 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.799
 But I do not like that 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.019
 really 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.140
 That's why I push it over my hair 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:08.329
 That's not really one thing about it 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.370
 particularly complex hairstyle or so but 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:11.870
 I just remembered it 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.730
 that I have not been that way for a long time 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.560
 I have worn that and that very much 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.760
 nice and that's why I wanted you 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.760
 show again briefly 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.710
 for the next hairstyle I would come 

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.690
 first a note where I am him 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.860
 So my dearest, that's the way it is now 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:46.570
 pretty much a mid-peak and then 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:48.639
 I need to have the same again from 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:50.740
 just as I said you can each other 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:55.120
 I'll take care of that too and now I can imagine that 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:57.490
 about my hair over it because now 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.340
 still looks pretty boring 

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:04.680
 I'm in the front of such a strand and 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:04.680
 Wrapped around a hair band and around 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:20.600
 Of course, I do the same now, too 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.600
 still on the other side 

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:26.790
 and then the hairstyle is already 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.550
 finished I think the whole thing has one 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:31.110
 little bit of hippie because of that 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.240
 I'm also pretty good lately 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:39.960
 just because now in this summer 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:42.090
 The hippie-time to arrive again is for 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.250
 the sixth but also the last hairstyle of 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:46.320
 this video I take a me 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.870
 crest here on the side of mine 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:56.220
 hair and put the back part first 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:58.440
 times away from the front part would be here 

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:00.690
 I have such a kind of time cards now 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.880
 make a compromise since card and to 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.530
 you do not even have to be able to braid because 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.290
 that can not be too good either 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:09.750
 So along the h lichen along it 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:12.150
 I just turn it all in as 

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:14.729
 I take here now rove a screwdriver 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.580
 is one and takes me more and more hair 

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:19.050
 Unfortunately , I did not have one here 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:21.090
 I do not particularly like mirrors 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:23.100
 well seen what I did here 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:26.210
 but I have the whole thing again before the 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.210
 mirror made for you 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.289
 screwing in and always having hair 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:34.530
 I take now at several 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:38.210
 put along this side and stuck 

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:40.560
 it always stuck with a bubi pin behind 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:44.189
 Here it might again take a closer look 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:46.639
 So the strand always turn one and 

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:49.169
 to take hair from behind 

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:51.030
 then I just have the back hair 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:53.370
 which I put away made about it 

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:55.620
 so you do not bobby pins anymore 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:59.250
 can see well and then see the whole 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:01.259
 also really cool out so that 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:05.120
 I will certainly wear more often because there 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:05.120
 all hair is still out of the face 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.509
 that was all six again 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.370
 hairstyles and somehow I am now to 

00:07:09.509 --> 00:07:13.169
 I have come to the conclusion that I am more 

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.449
 Motivate should be more often 

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:18.419
 to do different hairstyles because of me 

00:07:15.449 --> 00:07:20.849
 mostly just this one helped down 

00:07:18.419 --> 00:07:23.039
 Brand or hairstyle I am now 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:26.219
 I should have more 

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:27.509
 motivate and maybe you have 

00:07:26.219 --> 00:07:29.550
 you now also fancy this 

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:31.529
 adjust hairstyles if yes then 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:34.440
 I wish you much fun and 

00:07:31.529 --> 00:07:37.250
 otherwise I will only say until the end of 

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.250
 next video
