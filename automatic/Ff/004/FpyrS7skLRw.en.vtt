00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.099
 Many years 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.040
 Made in Tokyo 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.230
 Medium screen size 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.050
 If there was that scene 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.100
 It was sudden 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.390
 Chiba decided with a head to rob the breakdown 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.010
 The 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.030
 Mountain 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.160
 I want to do it from foreign capital which became Narayanan 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.390
 Was 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.039
 Let's get the show scene 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.030
 It is 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.280
 Harvard has bought in the match that has been in use since 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.340
 It means that it is too much 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.940
 If we work in a company, the author is against the viewer 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.970
 It will be easy to make a success story 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.320
 In addition 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.150
 The first victory that originally entered 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:18.540
 Roughly 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.930
 Face-to-face sales to office workers 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.970
 There is 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.030
 Leader 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.010
 I was a little worried 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.270
 Even if you say that you pick points first 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.250
 I do not know that it is the venue 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 Peace has not come up 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.560
 One to one increase 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.560
 Why are you talking about Koshiro? 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.770
 Because we are animations, there is nowhere else 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.000
 No problem, but the story will go 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.320
 It has been around since I opened Mar 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.610
 I was thinking of listening to something like 104 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.270
 It is a good audience of the sphere that looks like what you are looking at 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.570
 Even if I can not say such a thing 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.730
 It's sweet 104 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.730
 I just eat my heart 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.729
 Point at it 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:15.929
 What do you do if you go to an interview 

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:18.949
 No interview 

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:20.529
 It is less than 1924 

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:24.019
 We had source for road specific revenue source 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.529
 What is it, but you 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.859
 As I said many times 

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:32.680
 It's a smart viewer who looks like Gudagda 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.809
 We have escaped to hate some secret large numbers operations 

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:41.730
 It's something that the Lord lacks until now. 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:42.129
 Was 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.349
 I could not get enough people 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.659
 8 rounds 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:47.469
 Abbreviation 

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.899
 US presidential election 

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:53.039
 rain 

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.039
 I guess you're getting serious again 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.049
 In the first place 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.769
 This story is 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.709
 The place to call the company is the starting point 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:05.919
 I wonder if 10 kg has not come out 

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.329
 If you say what you do, it's completely different, so the story goes on 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:11.159
 Because I am 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.509
 From now on 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:14.400
 Figure 1 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.239
 I can not say anything anymore 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:19.619
 Replay for a game that starts over again 

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:20.509
 in addition 

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.930
 Even if you start over from this season, your hit makes a sudden hit 

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:26.849
 And that's because I got to win 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.110
 Not 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.290
 In charge of the Tigers 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.029
 Just that there is a foundation 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:33.909
 We are saying what it is if we recreate the same Wednesday 

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:37.909
 We have to reshape the author over a long period of time 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:40.909
 I told reporters who were walking on the road 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.199
 Kindergarten or school name written and signed 

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:46.649
 In short 

00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:51.049
 This is because it is commonplace and gone 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.049
 I have not two children 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:57.799
 I was told that I did not say that 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.579
 Let's go to the US 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.139
 That 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.139
 It corresponded to reproduction 

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:10.449
 You are 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.449
 Have you moved to the King's Stage? 

00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:17.039
 I did this time 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:19.799
 I was dismissed because I wanted to be a net shop 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.799
 I hope that you get it when you get it 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:27.710
 I want to fight in the future 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.319
 It was flat 

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:33.319
 So it was for example 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:35.559
 Even me 

00:04:35.559 --> 00:04:37.050
 What to do 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.909
 Suddenly the tone 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:41.909
 At all 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:49.639
 This time also kan I live in kan I look from the feeling I see 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.689
 It was only 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:55.150
 I was worried that I did not migrate data 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.110
 Still I wondered 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.280
 England seems no longer and watch out for changes 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.430
 Please 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.499
 And it seems to be in the middle 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.909
 It's a camel, they're veterans with them 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:11.400
 I see 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.979
 The city is Toyoko 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.999
 I wonder if it will be my opponent 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:18.729
 I 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:21.729
 2 will 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.520
 there were 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.960
 Then 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.199
 Dowitz 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:38.330
 Dowitz 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.839
 What kind of function is Westerners 

00:05:43.839 --> 00:05:44.769
 It's sea
