00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
just about finished here I've got

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.020 
just about finished here I've got
everything<00:00:06.509> set<00:00:06.930> up<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.580> everything<00:00:08.580> is

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
everything set up and everything is

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.110 
everything set up and everything is
functioning<00:00:09.269> all<00:00:09.900> we<00:00:10.110> need<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.290> do<00:00:10.469> now<00:00:10.710> is<00:00:11.120> get

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
functioning all we need to do now is get

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.129 
functioning all we need to do now is get
this<00:00:12.330> group<00:00:14.299> to<00:00:15.299> work<00:00:15.420> with<00:00:15.480> the<00:00:15.660> foot<00:00:15.809> control

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
this group to work with the foot control

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.359 
this group to work with the foot control
because<00:00:16.350> we<00:00:16.470> move<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.740> foot<00:00:16.890> control<00:00:17.190> right

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
because we move the foot control right

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.960 
because we move the foot control right
now<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:18.210> not<00:00:18.600> so<00:00:18.810> anything<00:00:19.289> so<00:00:19.529> just<00:00:19.970> select

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
now it's not so anything so just select

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.720 
now it's not so anything so just select
on<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.449> highest<00:00:21.830> top<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.039> group<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.519> I'm

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
on the highest top of the group and I'm

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.750 
on the highest top of the group and I'm
going<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.880> parent<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.330> to<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.510> foot<00:00:24.689> control

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:25.760 
going to parent it to the foot control

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.550 
going to parent it to the foot control
so<00:00:26.760> no<00:00:27.630> we<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.619> everything<00:00:29.269> functioning<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:30.560 
so no we have everything functioning and

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.280 
so no we have everything functioning and
obviously<00:00:31.560> we<00:00:32.219> need<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.790> pole<00:00:33.210> constraint<00:00:33.630> so<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
obviously we need a pole constraint so I

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.430 
obviously we need a pole constraint so I
dropped<00:00:34.620> in<00:00:34.739> this<00:00:34.860> arrow<00:00:35.160> here<00:00:36.079> from<00:00:37.079> comic

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
dropped in this arrow here from comic

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.790 
dropped in this arrow here from comic
tools<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:38.239> put<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.360> back<00:00:39.600> 0<00:00:40.110> I<00:00:40.230> just<00:00:40.440> want<00:00:40.739> to

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
tools and put this back 0 I just want to

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.369 
tools and put this back 0 I just want to
get<00:00:40.920> it<00:00:41.040> out<00:00:41.100> of<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.280> way<00:00:41.370> there<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.200> I'm<00:00:43.200> not

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
get it out of the way there and I'm not

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.610 
get it out of the way there and I'm not
going<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.530> do<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.829> double<00:00:44.219> group<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.610> this

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:45.620 
going to do the double group on this

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.279 
going to do the double group on this
it's<00:00:46.620> pretty<00:00:46.829> self-explanatory<00:00:47.899> on<00:00:48.899> keys<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
it's pretty self-explanatory on keys to

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.740 
it's pretty self-explanatory on keys to
it<00:00:49.379> so<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.649> change<00:00:49.739> this<00:00:49.920> pole<00:00:50.190> vector<00:00:50.340> so

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
it so just change this pole vector so

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.180 
it so just change this pole vector so
I'm<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:52.260> going<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.440> move<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.800> I'm<00:00:53.010> going<00:00:53.100> to

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
I'm just going to move this I'm going to

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.500 
I'm just going to move this I'm going to
snap<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.390> joints<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.850> then<00:00:56.850> just<00:00:57.329> move

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
snap it to the joints and then just move

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.040 
snap it to the joints and then just move
it<00:00:57.660> two<00:00:57.809> straight<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:59.210> and<00:01:00.210> make<00:01:00.480> sure<00:01:00.510> that

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
it two straight out and make sure that

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:08.870 
it two straight out and make sure that
I'm<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:05.510> oops<00:01:06.510> wrong<00:01:06.659> button<00:01:06.990> object<00:01:07.700> which<00:01:08.700> is

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
I'm in oops wrong button object which is

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.600 
I'm in oops wrong button object which is
I<00:01:08.909> think<00:01:09.270> it's<00:01:09.510> the<00:01:09.600> same<00:01:09.780> anyway<00:01:10.400> so<00:01:11.400> I'm<00:01:11.490> just

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
I think it's the same anyway so I'm just

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.700 
I think it's the same anyway so I'm just
move<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.880> straight<00:01:12.210> out<00:01:12.360> from<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.680> leg<00:01:13.680> now

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
move that straight out from the leg now

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.070 
move that straight out from the leg now
I<00:01:14.369> don't<00:01:14.970> know<00:01:15.060> one<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.330> things<00:01:15.360> I<00:01:15.689> like<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
I don't know one of the things I like to

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.660 
I don't know one of the things I like to
keep<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.350> closer<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.770> look<00:01:16.950> foot<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.369> it's<00:01:17.490> not

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
keep it closer to look foot so it's not

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.490 
keep it closer to look foot so it's not
out<00:01:17.820> here<00:01:17.970> in<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.150> middle<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.360> nowhere<00:01:18.659> so<00:01:18.930> I'm

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
out here in the middle of nowhere so I'm

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.700 
out here in the middle of nowhere so I'm
going<00:01:19.680> to<00:01:19.710> go<00:01:19.799> ahead<00:01:19.830> and<00:01:20.009> just<00:01:20.460> move<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.710> down

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
going to go ahead and just move it down

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.819 
going to go ahead and just move it down
so<00:01:23.840> just<00:01:24.840> out<00:01:25.080> of<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.290> way<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> little<00:01:25.650> bit

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:27.829 

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:30.230 

anyway<00:01:28.829> so<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.549> should<00:01:29.759> something<00:01:29.970> I'm

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
anyway so that should something I'm

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.330 
anyway so that should something I'm
going<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.170> I'm<00:01:31.500> going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.950> freeze

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
going to I'm going to freeze

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.410 
going to I'm going to freeze
transformations<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:33.299> that<00:01:33.770> guy<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:35.420> then

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
transformations on that guy and then

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.920 
transformations on that guy and then
select<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:38.210> obviously<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:39.630> selected

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
select that obviously have that selected

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:46.280 
select that obviously have that selected
I'm<00:01:40.619> going<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.100> name<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.280> though<00:01:44.810> leg<00:01:45.810> oops

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
I'm going to name it though leg oops

00:01:46.290 --> 00:02:04.970 
I'm going to name it though leg oops

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
happened should have a whole vector line

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:40.430 
happened should have a whole vector line
coming<00:02:33.240> out<00:02:33.420> that's<00:02:33.750> pretty<00:02:33.960> weird<00:02:34.140> huh<00:02:39.440> it's

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
coming out that's pretty weird huh it's

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.850 
coming out that's pretty weird huh it's
working<00:02:41.010> but<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.430> don't<00:02:43.610> had<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> pole<00:02:44.970> vector

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
working but I don't had a pole vector

00:02:45.860 --> 00:03:04.010 
working but I don't had a pole vector
come<00:02:46.860> on<00:03:01.940> i'm<00:03:02.940> going<00:03:03.120> to<00:03:03.210> parent<00:03:03.600> these<00:03:03.750> so<00:03:03.960> i

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
come on i'm going to parent these so i

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.540 
come on i'm going to parent these so i
select<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.320> the<00:03:04.410> pole<00:03:04.590> vector<00:03:04.770> first<00:03:05.220> let's

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
select to the pole vector first let's

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:13.880 
select to the pole vector first let's
just<00:03:05.850> select<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.680> control<00:03:07.680> a<00:03:08.240> parent<00:03:12.530> okay<00:03:13.530> so

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
just select the control a parent okay so

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.710 
just select the control a parent okay so
it's<00:03:14.310> working<00:03:14.580> I<00:03:14.970> don't<00:03:15.150> know<00:03:15.240> where<00:03:15.450> the

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
it's working I don't know where the

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:22.729
