00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
 in life 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.260
 although the olive oil and we are going to 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.599
 start with we put a few high 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:11.130
 easy ones that will take very little time 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.889
 while we are cooking a pasta if 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.900
 we are going to run olive oil 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.820
 infused with herbs and we're also going 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.529
 to merge with sauce so add a 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.650
 more quantity is a sauce we are going to 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.810
 use type aliÃ³ glasses down and olive very 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.519
 easy very soft and add a little bit of 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.679
 salt that dissolves inside the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.869
 oil and I will also place parsley 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:32.130
 I add a version with boil because 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.950
 I really like how it is with the 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.150
 herbs that in this case is parsley and 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.640
 I will also place a little bit of 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.740
 green and it's pretty interesting like that 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.690
 that then we mix green parsley or 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.280
 what is important here is that the oil does not 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.140
 be very hot but rather to 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.780
 an average temperature for them to leave 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.680
 merging with all the flavor of these from 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.900
 these herbs that I'm incorporating 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:01:00.270
 we will also get garlic sauce 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:01:02.780
 of scoop finds a new unit 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.780
 measure 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.290
 this is how this is how this is alioli 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.270
 it's going to take a lot of four spiral 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.120
 spirals we're going to place the count it 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.820
 infusion to the herbs slowly I'm going to 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.890
 put a little bit of pepper now I was going 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.650
 to wait for this the pastas that 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.220
 come out a very smooth sauce but 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.170
 very very easy also the aroma that goes 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:29.420
 releasing this the simple thing is very very 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.550
 rich many times we're looking for a lot 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.800
 with ingredients and with a sauce of this 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.840
 low cost type we have something very 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.910
 good flavor can heat milk cream 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.229
 and cream and I told them I was going to 

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.950
 be a version that appears but with 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.720
 blue cheese mixing a little bit 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.940
 true gastronomy trends among 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.590
 Italy and France still hot or cream 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:53.810
 of milk I have blue cheese that I'm going to 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.030
 show a little bit let's see if it's from 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.950
 two denominates technological and what we're going 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.690
 to do is dissolve this in cream 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.259
 Milk at the end we added some leaves 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:05.240
 of basil tomatoes cherrys will come out 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:07.190
 in our sauce very easy I will leave 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.090
 heating milk cream infusion masters 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.030
 also the cream 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.650
 with salt black pepper I'm going to add 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.450
 final because the cheese will also have a 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.129
 percentage of salt and then slow the 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.620
 cream of milk slow fire simmering 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.970
 because what happens if we snatch heat 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.489
 the cream of milk what usually happens 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.170
 is that all the soil evaporates and remains 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.299
 the butter only part of the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.190
 fat and then how it separates 

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:30.140
 like an oil above and that's what 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.970
 that you have to avoid that's why I tell you in 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.150
 the sauce case today we were 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.700
 working over medium heat over low heat 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.280
 just hot water and let's boil 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.440
 pasta you already know how much 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.049
 calculation always for every 100 grams of 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.930
 pasta we will be using a liter of 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.110
 water written there to the pan and we're going to 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:53.599
 minus 10 minutes of cooking so 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.910
 we leave here inside we are going to remove and not 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.650
 it is necessary to add neither oil nor butter 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.030
 no fat if we add 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.650
 fat what will happen is that 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.269
 then the glasses will be like 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.629
 waterproofed and they will not want 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.750
 bind to the sauce there we let boil the 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:11.000
 fire well to intense intense heat 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.599
 and the bases are coming out more or less in 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.599
 9 to 10 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:23.330
 for the challenge of the hot pan 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.560
 dew and what olive oil and let's do 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.050
 the sauce with tuna that I had promised you 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.580
 an easy Mediterranean series has already arrived 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:30.170
 also be salt pereira so I have 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.780
 to add as four more packages 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:34.940
 we add garlic sauce there getting depressed 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.890
 olive oil and direct we started 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.440
 also work with things tomatoes 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:42.770
 cherry alley cut in the room to one 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:44.000
 very easy sauce a sauce practically 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.220
 at the moment these pioneers are made 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.260
 to awaken ideas is to have 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.519
 to be all sitting at the table with 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.989
 that we're going to cut them and 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.390
 there are people who add sugar to the 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:59.030
 tomato sauce but it really gets lost 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:01.250
 totally the taste of what really 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.410
 you have to use well red you can not like that 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.180
 they are more sweeter and we add a pinch of 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.430
 salt add pepper sauce garlic 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.360
 olive oil and let's add now 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.400
 also parsley chopped parsley 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:14.550
 and we add a little you like tea 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.550
 green 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:22.530
 also add large onion 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.160
 for example a delicatessen in cans 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.930
 lemon tuna because the lemon and that 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.450
 is this lemon salt and I add the 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.580
 Lemon Beech Lemon Beech Spicy Garlic with 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.000
 tomato sauce a delicious thing 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.000
 Barbara 

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:48.149
 I have some obviously encouraging videos 

00:04:45.519 --> 00:04:50.259
 but inside 

00:04:48.149 --> 00:04:52.389
 also the and here you do not have to 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:55.019
 complicarte thursday we are already at doors 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:55.019
 To the weekend 

00:04:57.029 --> 00:05:03.819
 it may be that this is heating up 

00:05:00.609 --> 00:05:06.159
 this easy very rich very practical 

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.479
 we mix we mix we mix and it's going to 

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:10.959
 go out of this when you have the 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:13.419
 green from which we run good oil 

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:15.669
 the ringlets come in here so this 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:17.799
 it's easy the chairs you from here in 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:27.609
 mix it more make a sauce each 

00:05:17.799 --> 00:05:29.829
 there is a lot to change a little heavy 

00:05:27.609 --> 00:05:32.759
 obviously what is missing is a good 

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.759
 amount of Sardinian cheese 

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:41.829
 harder girls that will be ready 

00:05:38.589 --> 00:05:45.389
 and then he already eats your hand as 

00:05:41.829 --> 00:05:45.389
 that this girl always magnificent 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:51.780
 easier 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:59.830
 talking about this we have here cheese 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:02.770
 blue what's in there salute the 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:04.870
 cited lover of this cream cheese 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.780
 hot and we go area 2 and some tomatitos 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.820
 that there were integers to go 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.930
 cutting all that excess creaminess 

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:12.930
 that we have that seems to add 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:20.740
 ideal for people and the only thing I say is 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.479
 it says basil chopped basil 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.880
 chopped and say that I'm serving the 

00:06:22.479 --> 00:06:26.710
 challenge and at home how we are doing well 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.260
 until the oil that you relax time 

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:31.479
 massage exercise arms is step 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:33.430
 same you do not need but good basil 

00:06:31.479 --> 00:06:35.470
 then already and running cream 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:37.270
 and we put a touch just now of 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.250
 pepper we said that it's when we're not going to 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:41.410
 put because the cheese already has salt and what 

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.240
 last thing I need for this sauce is 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:45.010
 obviously already I have pasta and 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:47.850
 also cooked the cheese that will give me 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.850
 also a while 

00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:52.000
 we stopped at the end a few sheets of 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:54.100
 spinach and washed 

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.870
 that's ideal for kids of bofa figures 

00:06:54.100 --> 00:07:00.580
 they do not even know and it's almost like 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.440
 a warm salad is so we mix 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.740
 OK with the video and it's going to be ready 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:08.350
 good now that make the pasta 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.000
 alioli the pasta the field is blue and 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.670
 also the Mediterranean sauce with 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.550
 spinach options to eat suddenly 

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:17.500
 pasta healthier always bound with 

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:22.830
 meat so they have a good proposal 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.830
 here everything is peace
