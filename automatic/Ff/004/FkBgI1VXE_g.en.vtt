00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:08.059 
we're gonna give you a four inch deficit

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:12.080 
we're gonna give you a four inch deficit
to<00:00:09.059> four<00:00:09.360> deficit<00:00:09.870> so<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.410> benefit<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:11.090> the

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
to four deficit so the benefit of the

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.030 
to four deficit so the benefit of the
deficit<00:00:12.570> is<00:00:12.690> allows<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.139> get<00:00:13.290> pups<00:00:13.860> to

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
deficit is allows you to get pups to

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.450 
deficit is allows you to get pups to
keeper<00:00:14.400> in<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.519> range<00:00:15.049> so<00:00:16.049> the<00:00:16.139> deficit

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:18.460 
keeper in the range so the deficit

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.370 
keeper in the range so the deficit
that<00:00:19.359> was<00:00:19.509> to<00:00:19.630> do

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:20.380 
that was to do

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.500 
that was to do
good<00:00:20.620> idea

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:23.510 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.750 

last<00:00:24.080> people

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:31.189 
my spine snaps critical of me up here

my spine snaps critical of me up here
getting<00:00:31.490> lower<00:00:32.110> you<00:00:33.110> try<00:00:33.320> from<00:00:33.530> here<00:00:33.710> this<00:00:34.100> can

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:34.250 
getting lower you try from here this can

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:35.790 
getting lower you try from here this can
all<00:00:34.370> kind<00:00:34.579> of<00:00:34.640> see<00:00:34.760> what<00:00:34.879> that's<00:00:35.000> going<00:00:35.180> to<00:00:35.239> do

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
all kind of see what that's going to do

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.840 
all kind of see what that's going to do
it<00:00:36.829> echo<00:00:37.040> 1<00:00:37.340> gluteal<00:00:37.820> flex<00:00:38.120> pay

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.240 

there<00:00:44.230> now<00:00:45.230> what's<00:00:45.440> what's<00:00:45.739> this<00:00:45.859> going<00:00:46.039> to<00:00:46.129> do

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
there now what's what's this going to do

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.509 
there now what's what's this going to do
how<00:00:46.850> does<00:00:46.969> it<00:00:47.059> take<00:00:47.179> to<00:00:47.300> exercise<00:00:48.339> well<00:00:49.339> if<00:00:49.429> you

00:00:49.509 --> 00:00:49.519 
how does it take to exercise well if you

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.069 
how does it take to exercise well if you
need<00:00:49.699> a<00:00:49.850> normal<00:00:49.999> deadlift<00:00:50.510> there's<00:00:50.659> only<00:00:50.780> one

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
need a normal deadlift there's only one

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.349 
need a normal deadlift there's only one
whatever<00:00:51.769> distance<00:00:52.100> right<00:00:52.460> straight<00:00:53.089> up<00:00:53.120> and

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
whatever distance right straight up and

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:55.869 
whatever distance right straight up and
down<00:00:53.420> by<00:00:53.690> doing<00:00:53.960> this<00:00:54.109> as<00:00:54.979> he<00:00:55.190> thrust<00:00:55.489> forward

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
down by doing this as he thrust forward

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:57.579 
down by doing this as he thrust forward
there's<00:00:56.539> a<00:00:56.629> heck<00:00:56.989> of<00:00:57.079> a<00:00:57.170> lot<00:00:57.320> of<00:00:57.379> glute

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:57.589 
there's a heck of a lot of glute

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:00.099 
there's a heck of a lot of glute
activation<00:00:57.789> so<00:00:58.789> he's<00:00:58.909> now<00:00:59.059> instead<00:00:59.809> of<00:00:59.899> losing

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
activation so he's now instead of losing

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:01.359 
activation so he's now instead of losing
tension<00:01:00.439> as<00:01:00.619> he<00:01:00.739> comes<00:01:00.920> up<00:01:01.039> where<00:01:01.309> as

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:01.369 
tension as he comes up where as

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:02.590 
tension as he comes up where as
differently<00:01:01.789> sections<00:01:02.180> becomes<00:01:02.420> a<00:01:02.449> lot

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:02.600 
differently sections becomes a lot

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.880 
differently sections becomes a lot
easier<00:01:02.629> you<00:01:02.960> can<00:01:03.170> put<00:01:03.289> it<00:01:03.350> on<00:01:03.469> the<00:01:03.619> deadlift

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
easier you can put it on the deadlift

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.529 
easier you can put it on the deadlift
now<00:01:04.580> he's<00:01:04.729> actually<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.180> player<00:01:05.360> it's

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
now he's actually the player it's

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:06.999 
now he's actually the player it's
actually<00:01:05.750> really<00:01:05.960> hard<00:01:06.259> right<00:01:06.560> here

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
actually really hard right here

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:09.100 
actually really hard right here
to<00:01:07.580> do<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.759> different<00:01:08.090> force<00:01:08.270> angle<00:01:08.630> which<00:01:09.080> is

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
to do a different force angle which is

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.749 
to do a different force angle which is
asipi<00:01:09.590> one<00:01:09.710> of<00:01:09.770> your<00:01:09.890> favorite<00:01:10.159> exercises<00:01:10.549> the

hard time
back<00:01:15.040> and<00:01:15.250> forward<00:01:15.550> it's<00:01:16.150> different<00:01:16.720> the<00:01:16.870> fan

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
back and forward it's different the fan

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.080 
back and forward it's different the fan
pulls<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:17.800> back<00:01:17.830> and<00:01:18.280> forward<00:01:18.640> so<00:01:18.790> while<00:01:18.940> she

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:19.090 
pulls you back and forward so while she

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.889 
pulls you back and forward so while she
think<00:01:19.450> not<00:01:19.720> about<00:01:19.840> up<00:01:20.200> and<00:01:20.350> down

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
think not about up and down

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:22.719 
think not about up and down
having<00:01:21.470> the<00:01:21.530> racks<00:01:21.770> they're<00:01:22.040> creatures<00:01:22.520> you

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
having the racks they're creatures you

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.100 
having the racks they're creatures you
feel<00:01:23.060> obligated<00:01:23.180> to<00:01:23.540> touch<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.899> floor

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.110 
feel obligated to touch the floor

yeah<00:01:26.690> duh<00:01:27.110> second<00:01:27.410> exercise<00:01:27.770> to<00:01:27.890> this<00:01:29.620> just<00:01:30.620> to

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
yeah duh second exercise to this just to

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.630 
yeah duh second exercise to this just to
make<00:01:30.860> it<00:01:30.890> a<00:01:30.950> little<00:01:31.010> more<00:01:31.160> fun

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
make it a little more fun

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.190 
make it a little more fun
they<00:01:31.910> stabilizing<00:01:32.510> their<00:01:32.600> hands<00:01:32.930> and<00:01:33.110> you

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200 
they stabilizing their hands and you

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.510 
they stabilizing their hands and you
just<00:01:33.290> did<00:01:33.710> a<00:01:33.740> hip<00:01:33.890> extension<00:01:33.920> so<00:01:34.460> you

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
just did a hip extension so you

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.030 
just did a hip extension so you
eliminate<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.970> deadlift<00:01:35.300> so<00:01:36.020> you<00:01:36.410> do<00:01:36.530> 12<00:01:36.770> reps

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
eliminate the deadlift so you do 12 reps

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.940 
eliminate the deadlift so you do 12 reps
at<00:01:37.220> the<00:01:37.310> bar<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.970> the<00:01:38.360> back<00:01:38.510> drop<00:01:39.320> the<00:01:39.440> bar<00:01:39.620> for

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
at the bar and the back drop the bar for

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.520 
at the bar and the back drop the bar for
12<00:01:40.190> more<00:01:40.310> reps<00:01:40.520> just<00:01:40.640> at<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.910> band's<00:01:41.170> so<00:01:42.170> the

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
12 more reps just at the band's so the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.260 
12 more reps just at the band's so the
relative<00:01:42.830> foot<00:01:43.160> position<00:01:43.640> obviously<00:01:43.820> could

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
relative foot position obviously could

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.660 
relative foot position obviously could
dictate<00:01:44.510> how<00:01:45.500> much<00:01:45.560> flexion<00:01:46.040> is<00:01:46.310> happening

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:46.670 
dictate how much flexion is happening

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.830 
dictate how much flexion is happening
your<00:01:46.790> hip<00:01:46.940> versus<00:01:47.270> how<00:01:47.360> much<00:01:47.480> much<00:01:47.690> is

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
your hip versus how much much is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.050 
your hip versus how much much is
happening<00:01:47.990> to<00:01:48.230> me<00:01:48.410> so<00:01:49.370> if<00:01:49.430> he<00:01:49.520> moves<00:01:49.730> this<00:01:49.850> foot

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
happening to me so if he moves this foot

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.620 
happening to me so if he moves this foot
back<00:01:50.240> I'm<00:01:50.840> gonna<00:01:51.020> get<00:01:51.170> more<00:01:51.910> depth<00:01:52.910> as<00:01:53.150> and

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
back I'm gonna get more depth as and

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.300 
back I'm gonna get more depth as and
more<00:01:53.990> flexible<00:01:54.650> more<00:01:54.830> equation<00:01:55.190> to<00:01:55.280> hit<00:01:57.310> it's

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
more flexible more equation to hit it's

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.680 
more flexible more equation to hit it's
right<00:01:58.520> here<00:01:58.670> he's<00:01:58.820> got<00:01:58.940> his<00:01:59.120> foot<00:01:59.360> basically

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
right here he's got his foot basically

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.910 
right here he's got his foot basically
right<00:01:59.870> under<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.260> center<00:02:00.650> of<00:02:00.860> mass<00:02:02.620> so<00:02:03.620> if<00:02:03.770> he

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
right under the center of mass so if he

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.710 
right under the center of mass so if he
were<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.280> stay<00:02:04.520> more<00:02:04.670> upright<00:02:04.970> if<00:02:05.300> he<00:02:05.420> move<00:02:05.630> his

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
were to stay more upright if he move his

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.920 
were to stay more upright if he move his
foot<00:02:05.900> forward<00:02:06.290> more<00:02:06.730> more<00:02:07.750> just<00:02:08.750> a<00:02:08.899> more

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
foot forward more more just a more

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.110 
foot forward more more just a more
upright<00:02:09.320> and<00:02:09.680> even<00:02:10.040> have<00:02:10.160> less<00:02:10.369> travel<00:02:10.940> at<00:02:11.030> the

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
upright and even have less travel at the

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.300 
upright and even have less travel at the
hip<00:02:11.240> joint<00:02:11.480> right<00:02:11.740> and<00:02:12.740> I<00:02:12.800> said<00:02:12.980> hip<00:02:13.100> joint

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
hip joint right and I said hip joint

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.130 
hip joint right and I said hip joint
state<00:02:13.490> and<00:02:13.640> 90<00:02:13.790> degrees<00:02:14.060> now<00:02:14.210> so<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:14.930> the<00:02:15.020> knee

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
state and 90 degrees now so is the knee

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.530 
state and 90 degrees now so is the knee
joint<00:02:15.490> there's<00:02:16.490> gonna<00:02:16.580> be<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.760> lot<00:02:16.970> more<00:02:17.000> shear

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
joint there's gonna be a lot more shear

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.270 
joint there's gonna be a lot more shear
at<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.840> knee<00:02:17.990> because<00:02:18.260> he's<00:02:18.500> shoving<00:02:19.100> this

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280

at the knee because he's shoving this
leg<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:21.140> lot<00:02:21.290> more<00:02:21.320> muscular<00:02:21.830> a<00:02:22.010> lot<00:02:22.190> less

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
leg and a lot more muscular a lot less

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.860 
leg and a lot more muscular a lot less
muscular<00:02:22.670> work<00:02:22.910> where<00:02:23.150> if<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:23.360> lose<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> foot

heels to the ground it's all effectively
the<00:02:41.630> same<00:02:41.720> stuff<00:02:42.230> right<00:02:42.790> again<00:02:43.790> if<00:02:43.880> you<00:02:43.940> think
