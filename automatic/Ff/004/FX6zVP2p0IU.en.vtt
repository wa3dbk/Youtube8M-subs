00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
great for that too another question that

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.440 
great for that too another question that
I<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.530> recently<00:02:07.920> heard<00:02:08.310> about

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
I just recently heard about

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.260 
I just recently heard about
I<00:02:09.509> have<00:02:09.989> yet<00:02:10.200> to<00:02:10.229> try<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.890> a<00:02:10.950> lace<00:02:11.550> front<00:02:11.970> wig

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
I have yet to try is a lace front wig

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:15.619 
I have yet to try is a lace front wig
and<00:02:13.310> one<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.580> reasons<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.030> haven't<00:02:15.480> tried

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
and one of the reasons I haven't tried

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.509 
and one of the reasons I haven't tried
is<00:02:15.840> because<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.260> think<00:02:16.560> my<00:02:16.980> husband<00:02:17.370> will

00:02:17.509 --> 00:02:17.519 
is because I think my husband will

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:19.490 
is because I think my husband will
probably<00:02:18.030> flip<00:02:18.360> out<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.569> think<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:19.140> might<00:02:19.319> be

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
probably flip out I think that might be

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.759 
probably flip out I think that might be
just<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.830> little<00:02:20.040> too<00:02:20.220> much<00:02:20.640> for<00:02:20.879> him<00:02:21.090> but<00:02:21.840> but

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
just a little too much for him but but

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.490 
just a little too much for him but but
