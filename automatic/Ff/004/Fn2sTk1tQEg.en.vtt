that<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.920> cut<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.250> earlier<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.840> make

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
that I just cut out earlier and to make

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.740 
that I just cut out earlier and to make
the<00:01:52.470> penguins<00:01:52.979> face<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.640> body<00:01:53.790> I'm<00:01:54.149> creating

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
the penguins face and body I'm creating

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.679 
the penguins face and body I'm creating
a<00:01:54.869> big<00:01:55.170> loop<00:01:55.560> up<00:01:55.799> top<00:01:56.130> and<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.119> arm<00:01:57.390> I'm

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
a big loop up top and for the arm I'm

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.590 
a big loop up top and for the arm I'm
creating<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.590> little<00:01:58.890> loop<00:01:59.219> inward<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.450> this

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
creating a little loop inward so this

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.630 
creating a little loop inward so this
almost<00:02:00.930> looks<00:02:01.079> like<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.259> nest<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.950> then<00:02:02.520> I'm

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
almost looks like a nest and then I'm

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.240 
almost looks like a nest and then I'm
creating<00:02:03.000> another<00:02:03.390> loop<00:02:03.689> as<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:03.960> body<00:02:04.469> now

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
creating another loop as the body now

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.520 
creating another loop as the body now
I'm<00:02:05.520> drawing<00:02:05.880> in<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> eyes<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.020> way<00:02:07.350> this

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
I'm drawing in the eyes so that way this

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.559 
I'm drawing in the eyes so that way this
will<00:02:07.770> give<00:02:07.950> me<00:02:08.069> an<00:02:08.160> idea<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.670> how<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.209> penguin

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
will give me an idea on how the penguin

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.940 
will give me an idea on how the penguin
will<00:02:09.869> look<00:02:10.050> as<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.259> pillow

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
will look as a pillow

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.380 
will look as a pillow
cut<00:02:12.950> out<00:02:13.100> the<00:02:13.220> shape<00:02:13.250> and<00:02:13.640> body<00:02:13.850> of<00:02:14.150> your

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 
penguin then take the template and place

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.520 
penguin then take the template and place
it<00:02:16.970> on<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.210> wrong<00:02:17.360> side<00:02:17.630> of<00:02:17.840> your<00:02:17.870> white<00:02:18.230> felt

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
layer of fabric with the right sides

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.510 
layer of fabric with the right sides
facing<00:04:25.449> inward<00:04:26.050> trace<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.889> shape<00:04:27.100> of<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.370> owl
