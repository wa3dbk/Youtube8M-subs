00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 They gave alertness to the 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.870
 population in missions the situation is 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.420
 alarming the drastic rise in the level 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.759
 of the water left completely unused 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.009
 all the river infrastructure in the 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.360
 western coast of the province in 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.460
 montecarlo the water came to the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.699
 parking and fishing club that is 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.680
 a very high area in corpora made 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.750
 evacuations at customs offices 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.010
 migrations and prefectures 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.560
 plus two families on the island 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.439
 pindo'i and the service was suspended 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.020
 boat from Omani port in piray port and 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.610
 the water treads the asphalt tape touching 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.640
 the lower foundations of the bridge 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.040
 banana to reach a height of the river to 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:44.640
 the 27 meters the transit on the bridge 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.320
 banana would be completely interrupted in 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.690
 puerto rico- the fishing club has 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.309
 about one meter of water like 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.670
 the waterfront and the prefecture of the 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.680
 locality in port iguazú fell 260 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.989
 millimeters of rain in less than one 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.750
 week so the height of the river 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.550
 iguazú is 30 meters this keeps 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.619
 closed the throat circuit of 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.630
 devil the forecasts are not 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.850
 encouraging in Paraguay 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.619
 from almost a dozen locations is 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.469
 being affected by the rising of the river 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.289
 Parana from the neighboring country ensures 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.149
 that the worst part has not yet arrived and that the 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:21.689
 Friday the river would touch levels 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.340
 historic in the next 48 hours the 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.329
 river would reach the historic levels 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.700
 reached in 1998 when there was a 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:32.520
 last great flood that are remembered 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.549
 these latitudes in Paraguay are 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.880
 affected the ayolas localities to 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.780
 standing and I am president franco cerrito mayor 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.280
 martínez villalbín pillar among others 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.159
 in missions recommend the greatest 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.349
 caution when approaching the river or streams 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.939
 due to the danger involved in the 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.789
 growing I think it's a 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.830
 big worry luckily not 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.220
 we are in real season so 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.720
 we do not have there yet so much 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.579
 Complication of possible drowned 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.470
 but if really yes, this is 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.259
 product of the floods of the rains 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:10.619
 reality but good to try to have the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.090
 greater flow without being cautious and hopefully 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.110
 not wearing not very strong for 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.330
 this without 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.370
 the streets or the exit of the rivers for 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.160
 this will not generate chaos within 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.350
 the city but if I believe that the 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.180
 rain problem as this 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:26.810
 go down a little bit will go 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.550
 improving but the measures have been taken 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.770
 relevant to the case we have seen that the 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.410
 part i was one and you can not enter 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.120
 before the devil one is in the 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.070
 prefecture working to make it 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.959
 Keep everything possible so that all 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.959
 be no more a flood and nothing more 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:46.850
 good 9 34 13 the temperature let's 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:50.150
 continue with this topic we will continue with 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:52.300
 information linked to the bread I was 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.300
