 diamond picks and starting to break 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.940
 obsidian which is next to 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.380
 camp it needs to be broken a hundred times 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.390
 what if you want to secure your 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.729
 camp every day you have to go to 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.280
 this time, and protect it as there is 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.220
 one danger is equally important next to 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.390
 camp near the fire are two stoves 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.000

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.720
 destroyed also in the camp there are three 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.269
 upgrade so not like garden landhaus 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.820

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.090
 And I will tell you how to make money later 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.890
 after you buy upgrade garden you 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.260
 you can farm on your own 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.120
 territories on any other territory for 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.400

 upgrade crusher needed for processing 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.840
 cobblestones and the first to put the chest 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.030
