featherweight foundation with an Inc
light<00:01:23.369> hold<00:01:24.060> or<00:01:24.420> something<00:01:24.750> like<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:24.930> that's

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
light hold or something like that that's

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.260 
light hold or something like that that's
like<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.619> claim<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.250> because<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> is

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
like the claim on this because it is

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.080 
like the claim on this because it is
super<00:01:27.720> super<00:01:28.049> lightweight<00:01:28.890> but<00:01:29.729> it<00:01:29.820> wears

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
super super lightweight but it wears

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.539 
super super lightweight but it wears
like<00:01:30.450> all<00:01:30.930> day<00:01:31.619> long<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.009> think<00:01:32.070> they<00:01:32.310> say<00:01:32.460> it's

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
like all day long I think they say it's

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.460 
like all day long I think they say it's
like<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.700> 24-hour<00:01:33.210> foundation<00:01:34.020> so<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.320> got<00:01:34.439> a

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
like a 24-hour foundation so it's got a

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.469 
like a 24-hour foundation so it's got a
super<00:01:34.740> hold<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.670> very<00:01:35.970> very<00:01:36.240> lightweight

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
super hold it is very very lightweight

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:38.929 
super hold it is very very lightweight
so<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.930> feather<00:01:37.140> weights<00:01:37.650> feel<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.759> is

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
so the feather weights feel of it is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.969 
so the feather weights feel of it is
exactly<00:01:39.390> accurate<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.049> feels<00:01:40.320> like<00:01:40.590> nothing

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
exactly accurate it feels like nothing

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.690 
exactly accurate it feels like nothing
on<00:01:41.430> your<00:01:41.640> skin<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.150> literally<00:01:42.540> feels<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:44.100> good

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
on your skin it literally feels so good

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.950 
on your skin it literally feels so good
like<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.000> don't<00:01:45.149> feel<00:01:45.299> anything<00:01:45.570> it's<00:01:45.810> not

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
like you don't feel anything it's not

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.679 
like you don't feel anything it's not
sticky<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.520> thick<00:01:47.939> it's<00:01:48.180> super

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
sticky it's not thick it's super

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.620 
sticky it's not thick it's super
lightweight<00:01:49.430> and<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.549> just<00:01:50.729> feels<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.090> good<00:01:51.570> on

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
lightweight and it just feels so good on

your<00:01:51.840> skin<00:01:51.990> I<00:01:52.380> would<00:01:53.130> say<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.549> like<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850

looks right here it's not too runny I'd
say<00:03:01.530> probably<00:03:01.879> we<00:03:02.879> try<00:03:03.419> this<00:03:03.480> one<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.049> see

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
say probably we try this one and see

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.559 
say probably we try this one and see
let's<00:03:04.560> compare<00:03:04.980> see<00:03:05.849> this<00:03:06.000> one<00:03:06.180> is<00:03:06.269> a<00:03:06.299> pump

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:06.569 
let's compare see this one is a pump

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:08.569 
let's compare see this one is a pump
that's<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:06.989> way<00:03:07.109> it<00:03:07.230> should<00:03:07.290> be<00:03:07.590> by<00:03:08.250> itself

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
that's the way it should be by itself

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.140 
that's the way it should be by itself
okay<00:03:08.819> so<00:03:10.189> that's<00:03:11.189> the<00:03:11.430> two<00:03:11.639> right<00:03:11.849> there<00:03:11.969> so

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
okay so that's the two right there so

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.089 
okay so that's the two right there so
that's<00:03:12.359> yeah<00:03:12.930> they're<00:03:13.169> what<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.590> to<00:03:13.919> shake

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099

that's yeah they're what the to shake
lot<00:03:14.340> one<00:03:14.489> is<00:03:14.609> definitely<00:03:14.879> run<00:03:15.329> ear<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.109> you<00:03:16.200> can

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
lot one is definitely run ear so you can

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:17.780 
lot one is definitely run ear so you can
see<00:03:16.590> actually<00:03:16.949> that<00:03:16.979> yeah<00:03:17.159> the<00:03:17.340> sheets<00:03:17.609> are

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
see actually that yeah the sheets are

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.939 
see actually that yeah the sheets are
pretty<00:03:18.599> much<00:03:18.900> identical<00:03:20.120> so<00:03:21.120> that's<00:03:21.659> the<00:03:21.959> so

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
pretty much identical so that's the so

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:24.770 
pretty much identical so that's the so
this<00:03:23.099> is<00:03:23.250> the<00:03:23.340> two<00:03:23.519> shade<00:03:23.729> clot<00:03:24.060> one<00:03:24.299> and<00:03:24.569> that

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.589 
one is the fusion ink so you can see
that<00:03:28.739> they<00:03:28.979> both<00:03:29.280> under<00:03:30.090> when<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.299> blend<00:03:30.510> them

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599
