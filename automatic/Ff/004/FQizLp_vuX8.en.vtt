00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
five and 3/8 we're gonna take a picture

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.370 
five and 3/8 we're gonna take a picture
of<00:03:56.130> that<00:03:56.220> no<00:03:56.460> worries<00:03:56.670> and<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.630> width<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.080> had

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
of that no worries and the width I had

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.530 
of that no worries and the width I had
before<00:03:58.890> it<00:03:58.950> hits<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.310> battery<00:03:59.970> holder<00:04:00.390> right

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
before it hits the battery holder right

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.990 
before it hits the battery holder right
here<00:04:00.600> I<00:04:00.930> don't<00:04:01.350> wanna<00:04:01.590> I'm<00:04:02.490> a<00:04:02.550> measure<00:04:02.850> from

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
here I don't wanna I'm a measure from

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.940 
here I don't wanna I'm a measure from
this<00:04:03.180> point<00:04:03.420> to<00:04:04.140> this<00:04:04.260> point<00:04:04.470> just<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:04.770> make

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
this point to this point just to make

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.020 
this point to this point just to make
sure<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.340> we<00:04:05.700> don't<00:04:05.910> hit<00:04:06.060> that<00:04:06.090> a<00:04:06.270> point

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
sure so we don't hit that a point

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.000 
sure so we don't hit that a point
actually<00:04:09.030> if<00:04:09.390> he<00:04:09.510> made<00:04:09.660> the<00:04:09.690> he<00:04:10.440> made<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.740> fuse

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
actually if he made the he made the fuse

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:17.899

zero gauge and then one input for my
starter<00:04:31.780> wire<00:04:31.930> it<00:04:32.169> needs<00:04:32.349> to<00:04:32.500> be<00:04:32.620> a<00:04:33.509> with<00:04:34.509> a

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
starter wire it needs to be a with a

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.290 
starter wire it needs to be a with a
terminal<00:04:35.050> terminal<00:04:35.740> connection<00:04:36.340> and<00:04:36.520> these

terminal terminal connection and these

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.240 
terminal terminal connection and these
three<00:04:37.569> I<00:04:37.750> can<00:04:37.900> cut<00:04:38.080> these<00:04:38.229> off<00:04:38.439> we<00:04:38.800> don't<00:04:38.919> if<00:04:39.129> it

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
three I can cut these off we don't if it

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.240 
three I can cut these off we don't if it
make<00:04:39.759> if<00:04:39.969> it<00:04:40.090> makes<00:04:40.330> it<00:04:40.419> so<00:04:40.599> you<00:04:40.629> can<00:04:41.129> make<00:04:42.129> it

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
make if it makes it so you can make it

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.379 
make if it makes it so you can make it
easier<00:04:42.520> and<00:04:42.729> then<00:04:42.819> I<00:04:42.879> don't<00:04:43.000> have<00:04:43.090> to<00:04:43.240> use

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:43.389 
easier and then I don't have to use

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:44.730 
easier and then I don't have to use
these<00:04:43.569> terminals<00:04:44.050> I<00:04:44.169> could<00:04:44.289> cut<00:04:44.439> these<00:04:44.560> off

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
these terminals I could cut these off

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.020 
these terminals I could cut these off
real<00:04:44.949> easy<00:04:45.159> and<00:04:45.370> disconnect<00:04:45.759> the<00:04:45.849> wire

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
real easy and disconnect the wire

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.730 
real easy and disconnect the wire
directly<00:04:46.300> into<00:04:46.599> the<00:04:46.689> fuse<00:04:46.900> block<00:04:47.050> so<00:04:47.500> I<00:04:47.530> need

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
directly into the fuse block so I need

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.320 
directly into the fuse block so I need
five<00:04:48.069> connections<00:04:48.370> four<00:04:48.699> zero<00:04:48.879> gauge<00:04:49.060> and

inches nice and easy long as it's no

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:21.149 
inches nice and easy long as it's no
wider<00:05:18.719> you<00:05:19.719> do<00:05:19.840> four<00:05:20.080> inches<00:05:20.319> in<00:05:20.379> depth<00:05:20.740> but

00:05:21.149 --> 00:05:21.159 
wider you do four inches in depth but

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:26.860 
wider you do four inches in depth but
long<00:05:21.400> as<00:05:21.580> it's<00:05:21.759> no<00:05:22.089> wider<00:05:22.330> than<00:05:22.479> four<00:05:23.259> inches

from<00:05:33.110> four<00:05:33.350> inches<00:05:33.620> looks<00:05:33.920> like<00:05:34.040> it's<00:05:34.190> three

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
from four inches looks like it's three

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:35.800 
from four inches looks like it's three
inches<00:05:34.550> so<00:05:34.730> it's<00:05:34.910> about<00:05:35.060> an<00:05:35.240> inch<00:05:35.300> in<00:05:35.600> the

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
inches so it's about an inch in the
