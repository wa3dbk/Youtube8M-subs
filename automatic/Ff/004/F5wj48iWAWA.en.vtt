00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
1795 where maybe cxs is hard to tell

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.519 
1795 where maybe cxs is hard to tell
after<00:00:27.330> 200<00:00:27.900> years<00:00:28.609> in<00:00:29.609> my<00:00:30.240> opinion<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.230> from

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
after 200 years in my opinion and from

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.280 
after 200 years in my opinion and from
the<00:00:31.980> light<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.610> goes<00:00:32.820> like<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.360> alright<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
the light it goes like that alright and

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:40.790 
the light it goes like that alright and
then<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> zero<00:00:35.809> 1796<00:00:36.809> and<00:00:37.110> 70<00:00:37.730> 69<00:00:39.230> this<00:00:40.230> is<00:00:40.440> very

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
then a zero 1796 and 70 69 this is very

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.069 
then a zero 1796 and 70 69 this is very
early<00:00:41.420> man<00:00:42.590> ok<00:00:43.670> retaining<00:00:44.670> wall<00:00:44.879> I<00:00:44.910> saw<00:00:45.420> across

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
early man ok retaining wall I saw across

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.600 
early man ok retaining wall I saw across
the<00:00:46.170> stream<00:00:46.710> I<00:00:46.920> thought<00:00:47.160> it<00:00:47.280> might<00:00:47.309> have<00:00:47.520> been

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the stream I thought it might have been

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.510 
the stream I thought it might have been
a<00:00:47.670> mill<00:00:48.110> foundation<00:00:51.920> yeah<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.129> may<00:00:53.309> be<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
a mill foundation yeah that may be a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.090 
a mill foundation yeah that may be a
side<00:00:54.390> of<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.660> house<00:00:54.870> or<00:00:55.199> maybe<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:55.920> the

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:11.220 

here's<00:02:08.709> the<00:02:08.830> back<00:02:09.250> corner<00:02:10.149> of<00:02:10.179> the<00:02:10.330> foundation

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
here's the back corner of the foundation

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.550 
here's the back corner of the foundation
and<00:02:11.670> there's<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.760> more<00:02:13.060> significant<00:02:13.840> running

River<00:02:15.330> this<00:02:16.330> was<00:02:16.569> probably<00:02:16.780> what<00:02:17.620> powered<00:02:18.069> up

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
River this was probably what powered up

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.580 
River this was probably what powered up
that<00:02:18.430> big<00:02:18.700> wheel<00:02:18.970> that<00:02:19.510> I<00:02:19.569> can<00:02:19.840> imagine<00:02:20.080> there

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
that big wheel that I can imagine there

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.740 
that big wheel that I can imagine there
I'm<00:02:20.890> way<00:02:21.129> on<00:02:21.310> the<00:02:21.459> back<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.879> the<00:02:21.970> foundation

now I just walked through here nice and
flattened<00:02:26.549> you<00:02:27.549> can<00:02:27.580> just<00:02:28.000> imagine<00:02:28.980> what<00:02:29.980> kind

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
flattened you can just imagine what kind

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.280 
flattened you can just imagine what kind
of<00:02:30.370> coins<00:02:30.730> and<00:02:31.060> tools<00:02:31.330> and<00:02:31.660> buttons<00:02:32.019> are<00:02:32.170> in

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
of coins and tools and buttons are in

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.190 
of coins and tools and buttons are in
the<00:02:32.410> ground<00:02:32.680> here<00:02:33.480> when<00:02:34.480> you<00:02:34.629> get<00:02:34.690> back<00:02:34.750> here

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
the ground here when you get back here

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.960 
the ground here when you get back here
with<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.500> detectors<00:02:36.129> for<00:02:36.310> sure<00:02:36.519> that'll

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
with the detectors for sure that'll

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.080 
with the detectors for sure that'll
might<00:02:37.450> make<00:02:37.660> another<00:02:37.690> episode<00:02:38.610> we've<00:02:39.610> got<00:02:39.819> to

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
might make another episode we've got to

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:41.940 
might make another episode we've got to
Mills<00:02:40.390> out<00:02:40.629> here<00:02:40.930> maybe<00:02:41.200> we'll<00:02:41.410> make<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.620> dual

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
Mills out here maybe we'll make a dual

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.729 
Mills out here maybe we'll make a dual
mill<00:02:42.280> episode<00:02:43.049> come<00:02:44.049> back<00:02:44.230> with<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.470> metal

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 
mill episode come back with a metal

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.670 
mill episode come back with a metal
detectors<00:02:45.370> but<00:02:46.239> this<00:02:46.390> is<00:02:46.569> a<00:02:46.599> nice<00:02:46.900> example<00:02:47.079> of

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
detectors but this is a nice example of

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.539 
detectors but this is a nice example of
a<00:02:48.540> colonial<00:02:49.540> New<00:02:49.989> England<00:02:50.379> well<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:51.220> serve

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
a colonial New England well that serve

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:59.009 
a colonial New England well that serve
the<00:02:51.730> mill<00:02:51.970> people<00:02:57.299> want<00:02:58.299> to<00:02:58.390> show<00:02:58.629> you<00:02:58.690> where
