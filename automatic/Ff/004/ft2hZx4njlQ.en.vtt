00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.780
 I bring a vehicle as weird a vehicle 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.730
 rare secret vehicle you can call him if 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.490
 you want although we can find you in the 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.440
 map is elba pit peyote a vehicle that 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.170
 if you want to be the most tumbos of all the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.630
 city can not miss in your garage 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.340
 a vehicle that has a wide 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.439
 variety of modifications in terms of 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.400
 the jumps just referred to and good 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.320
 it's a vehicle that I liked 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.029
 a lot and although its speed is not 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.859
 excessive makes up for it with a very good 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.750
 handling is worth so nothing much of 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.670
 you will already know him you already know 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.989
 where is it but many others not so 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.180
 good as a car has turned out 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.850
 pretty attractive, I've decided 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.920
 show you where you are and what types 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.649
 of modifications you can make in it 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.329
 so nothing let's see it we 're going to 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.370
 start by seeing your exact location 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.600
 where you can find the only thing 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.370
 you have to do is come here I'm going to 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.070
 show the map so you do not have 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.840
 no doubt this car the peyote bapip 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.510
 You are here at this location 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.949
 from here and its original color and its shape 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.480
 original is this that we have here as 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.760
 You see, it has a spare wheel that is 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.350
 what characterizes him especially 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.730
 what makes it something more special is that 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.680
 take that spare wheel there in the 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.180
 back and nothing because you can 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.090
 find here is very simple it appears 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.890
 about between 11 o'clock in the morning 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.200
 11 in the morning to two in the 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.240
 late three in the afternoon okay I do not know if 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.620
 it requires some specific level me 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.660
 like in the comments if so 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.740
 outside those who find it or those who 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.540
 you go to look for they put the 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.280
 Comment I have level x your 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.500
 level and I've found it worth so 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.080
 to be able to see more or less with what 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.730
 level we can find it well then nothing 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.230
 here is the car as we have seen what 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:38.670
 we have caught what we have stolen without any 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:40.470
 kind of problem you may have 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.940
 you some more problem since it is a 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.729
 bird here some bands some 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.320
 bad people who are going to shoot you in 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.240
 As soon as you try to steal the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.650
 car so nothing now let's put him 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.870
 the saints just to see what we can 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.880
 do what modifications we can put 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:55.620
 and here we are introducing LEDs already in 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.810
 the righteous saints the closest 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.370
 I had at that time and how are you going to be able to 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.930
 observe good you are not going to have any 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.810
 problem in putting your locator 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.060
 and an insurance for what 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:07.369
 to heal us in health in possible 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.929
 explosions that the car may have and 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.670
 You see you can have as good has 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.890
 the typical modifications of any 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.420
 vehicle plus some extra of this 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.290
 particular vehicle in particular as 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.880
 it may be what you are seeing 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.739
 then put a wheel on it 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.420
 Spare wheel can remove it or leave 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.099
 we are going choco that will be let 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.989
 because as I said before, it's something 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:26.060
 which makes it characteristic that makes 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:28.280
 special to this type of vehicle to this 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.940
 car and nothing like I said a car very 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:33.530
 nice very durable very attractive about 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.269
 everything in sight how are you going to be able to see 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.190
 when I take him out when he changes the 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.530
 color and take it out now it had happened to 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.540
 that you see and he has finally been 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.730
 this vehicle and here you have it as you see 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.680
 it has been quite attractive to what 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.390
 which sight is referred to as you see it 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.190
 I have put a red color a red color 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.049
 strong and then I've mixed it with 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.299
 other colors that in this car you can 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.730
 to do it is worth putting it as a kind of 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.319
 chrome-plated on top of another type of color 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.690
 of another color as you see when I move the 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.489
 camera seems to shine on the edges 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.860
 there seems to be a color like grayish 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.630
 whitish that makes you pretty 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.250
 quite special is worth quite special 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.810
 as I say at sight is a very car 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:09.590
 attractive as I say you will be the most 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.440
 crappy 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.030
 from the neighborhood with this car and nothing 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:16.730
 just tell you that if you liked it, 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.440
