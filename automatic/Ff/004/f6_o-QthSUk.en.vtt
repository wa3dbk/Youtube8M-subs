00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 fear 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.090
 an exhibition on the art of the philippines 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:19.090
 starting from the northern cordillera 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.700
 Luçon to the Sultanate and the Empire 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.490
 southern maritime 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.570
 the originality of the exhibition is that 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.430
 it includes archaeological pieces 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.750
 very old and she kisses a 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.160
 period of time that is considerable 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.160
 since it goes to the twentieth century 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.980
 we 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.720
 we shared the exhibition in two 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.489
 looks turned to voltaire all 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.739
 concerning the populations with 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.720
 mountaineers who have taken refuge in 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.910
 the heights of light and mindanao 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.860
 objects from these populations of 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.470
 Montagnards are not carved 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.330
 necessarily before the 16th century so we 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.940
 guess they kept the momentum 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.780
 precontact of Europeans and another 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:13.150
 look at the sea ​​so these are 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.060
 of the lowland arts of the coasts of 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.850
 sultanates of mindanao on which 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.399
 developed a great trade and suddenly 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.840
 my production of art objects more 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.619
 turned to the evil world is no longer 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.619
 facing the sea 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.580
 I think it's an exhibition 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.650
 poetic and refined and besides 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.050
 it's also an exhibition that allows you to 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.060
 discover ethnic groups that we do not 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.890
 do not know at branly this is one of 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.120
 exhibitions that will allow the most to 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.320
 visitors to discover a universe 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.320
 totally unknown
