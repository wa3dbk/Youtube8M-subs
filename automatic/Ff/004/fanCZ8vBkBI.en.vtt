00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
I've got my fabric pretend like this

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.109 
I've got my fabric pretend like this
isn't<00:00:26.670> turned<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.990> here's<00:00:28.680> my<00:00:28.920> Appel<00:00:29.189> on<00:00:29.340> 72f

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
isn't turned and here's my Appel on 72f

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.920 
isn't turned and here's my Appel on 72f
lay<00:00:30.779> it<00:00:30.960> all<00:00:31.050> your<00:00:31.560> ladies<00:00:31.710> on<00:00:31.949> top<00:00:32.719> this<00:00:33.719> will

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
lay it all your ladies on top this will

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.040 
lay it all your ladies on top this will
cut<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.260> master<00:00:34.680> time<00:00:35.540> covered<00:00:36.540> it<00:00:36.630> over

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
cut the master time covered it over

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.139 
cut the master time covered it over
because<00:00:37.920> remember<00:00:38.309> this<00:00:38.610> side<00:00:38.820> is<00:00:38.969> also

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
because remember this side is also

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.119 
because remember this side is also
feasible<00:00:42.260> covered<00:00:43.260> it<00:00:43.379> with<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.800> parchment

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
feasible covered it with the parchment

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.060 
feasible covered it with the parchment
paper<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.000> I've<00:00:45.629> used<00:00:45.960> it<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.320> think<00:00:46.680> I<00:00:46.739> held<00:00:46.950> it

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
paper and I've used it I think I held it

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.549 
paper and I've used it I think I held it
down<00:00:47.190> for<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.670> 10<00:00:48.210> 12<00:00:48.629> seconds<00:00:49.410> something

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
down for like 10 12 seconds something

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.850 
down for like 10 12 seconds something
like<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.070> I<00:00:50.340> let<00:00:50.910> it<00:00:51.030> cool<00:00:51.270> and<00:00:51.690> what's<00:00:52.649> so

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
like that I let it cool and what's so

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.850 
like that I let it cool and what's so
cool<00:00:53.070> about<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.430> parchment<00:00:53.879> paper<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.629> if<00:00:55.590> you

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
cool about the parchment paper is if you

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.590 
cool about the parchment paper is if you
thing<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.370> feasible<00:00:56.730> webbing<00:00:57.059> won't<00:00:57.239> stick

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
thing the feasible webbing won't stick

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.130 
thing the feasible webbing won't stick
to<00:00:57.809> it

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
to it

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.930 
to it
so<00:00:58.289> I've<00:00:58.379> cooled<00:00:58.859> off<00:00:59.070> all<00:00:59.309> you<00:00:59.430> have<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.670> do<00:00:59.789> is

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
so I've cooled off all you have to do is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.729 
so I've cooled off all you have to do is
pull<00:01:00.270> it<00:01:00.690> off<00:01:01.699> all<00:01:02.699> right<00:01:02.789> all<00:01:03.690> right<00:01:03.750> next

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
pull it off all right all right next

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.980 
pull it off all right all right next
thing<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.250> did<00:01:05.309> was<00:01:06.200> about<00:01:07.200> okay<00:01:08.869> well<00:01:09.869> guess

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
thing I did was about okay well guess

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.520 
thing I did was about okay well guess
what<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:11.010> is<00:01:11.159> usable<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.869> needed<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.320> turn

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
what this is usable and I needed to turn

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.990 
what this is usable and I needed to turn
the<00:01:13.710> edges<00:01:15.080> so<00:01:16.080> I<00:01:16.170> very<00:01:16.380> carefully<00:01:16.850> took<00:01:17.850> my

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
the edges so I very carefully took my

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.020 
the edges so I very carefully took my
regular<00:01:18.509> iron<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.290> turn<00:01:20.280> off<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.549> steam<00:01:20.820> or

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
regular iron and turn off the steam or

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.850 
regular iron and turn off the steam or
you'll<00:01:21.150> burn<00:01:21.270> your<00:01:21.509> fingers<00:01:21.869> like<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.259> did<00:01:22.500> and

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
you'll burn your fingers like I did and

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.230 
you'll burn your fingers like I did and
I<00:01:23.640> very<00:01:23.880> carefully<00:01:24.560> turn<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.830> fabric<00:01:26.240> using

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
I very carefully turn the fabric using

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.700 
I very carefully turn the fabric using
my<00:01:27.390> iron<00:01:27.829> my<00:01:28.829> hot<00:01:29.040> iron<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.960> I<00:01:30.960> could<00:01:31.590> have

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
my iron my hot iron and I could have

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.249 
my iron my hot iron and I could have
left<00:01:31.920> myself<00:01:32.130> a<00:01:32.520> whole<00:01:32.820> lot<00:01:33.240> more<00:01:33.420> fabric<00:01:34.020> and

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
left myself a whole lot more fabric and

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.749 
left myself a whole lot more fabric and
I<00:01:34.920> wouldn't<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.189> had<00:01:35.280> to<00:01:35.369> be<00:01:35.520> so<00:01:35.729> careful

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
I wouldn't have had to be so careful

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.480 
I wouldn't have had to be so careful
about<00:01:36.509> you<00:01:37.350> know<00:01:37.470> not<00:01:37.770> letting<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.280> iron

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
about you know not letting the iron

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.120 
about you know not letting the iron
touch<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.200> fusible<00:01:40.200> right<00:01:40.500> here<00:01:40.770> would<00:01:41.009> have

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
touch the fusible right here would have

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.380 
touch the fusible right here would have
been<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.250> whole<00:01:41.460> lot<00:01:41.490> easier<00:01:41.700> but<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.150> didn't

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
been a whole lot easier but I didn't

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.850 
been a whole lot easier but I didn't
think<00:01:42.540> about<00:01:42.659> that<00:01:42.810> till<00:01:43.200> I<00:01:43.320> already<00:01:43.619> had<00:01:43.740> it

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
think about that till I already had it

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.060 
think about that till I already had it
cut<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:45.390> just<00:01:45.600> very<00:01:45.869> carefully<00:01:46.229> turned<00:01:46.829> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
cut and I just very carefully turned it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.350 
cut and I just very carefully turned it
and<00:01:48.049> using<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.140> hot<00:01:49.320> iron<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.909> just<00:01:51.149> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and using the hot iron and I just I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.310 
and using the hot iron and I just I
turned<00:01:51.780> it<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:52.079> way<00:01:52.229> works<00:01:53.159> pretty<00:01:53.310> good<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
turned it that way works pretty good I

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:59.679 
turned it that way works pretty good I
think<00:01:55.549> so<00:01:56.549> this<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.180> what<00:01:57.329> we<00:01:57.390> have<00:01:57.540> so<00:01:57.750> far

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
think so this is what we have so far

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.069 
think so this is what we have so far
works<00:02:00.689> great

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:02.079 
works great

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:04.700 
works great
another<00:02:02.680> thing<00:02:02.979> that<00:02:03.159> I'm<00:02:03.280> trying<00:02:03.520> is<00:02:03.939> on

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
another thing that I'm trying is on

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.690 
another thing that I'm trying is on
yours<00:02:05.710> you<00:02:06.479> cut<00:02:07.479> the<00:02:07.570> pattern<00:02:07.929> apart<00:02:08.349> and<00:02:08.800> you

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
yours you cut the pattern apart and you

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.390 
yours you cut the pattern apart and you
you<00:02:10.060> know<00:02:10.209> you<00:02:10.620> we<00:02:11.620> know<00:02:11.800> what<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.040> did<00:02:12.220> and

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
you know you we know what you did and

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.100 
you know you we know what you did and
then<00:02:12.819> you<00:02:12.849> top<00:02:13.150> stitch<00:02:13.450> along<00:02:13.750> here<00:02:13.959> if<00:02:14.019> you

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
then you top stitch along here if you

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.479 
then you top stitch along here if you
put<00:02:14.319> them<00:02:14.440> back<00:02:14.560> together<00:02:14.739> so<00:02:15.069> what<00:02:15.190> I'm<00:02:15.310> going

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
put them back together so what I'm going

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.780 
put them back together so what I'm going
to<00:02:15.519> try<00:02:15.700> to<00:02:15.730> do<00:02:15.940> is<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.660> took<00:02:17.290> the<00:02:17.769> pattern<00:02:18.519> and<00:02:18.730> I

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
to try to do is I took the pattern and I

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.400 
to try to do is I took the pattern and I
marked<00:02:19.150> where<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.420> bottom<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:19.900> the<00:02:19.959> bag<00:02:20.140> would

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
marked where the bottom of the bag would

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.589 
marked where the bottom of the bag would
be<00:02:20.590> look<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:21.400> marked<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:21.910> with<00:02:22.120> a<00:02:22.360> green

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
be look and I marked it with a green

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.740 
be look and I marked it with a green
line<00:02:22.840> took<00:02:23.739> it<00:02:23.890> to<00:02:23.980> my<00:02:24.129> sewing<00:02:24.370> machine<00:02:24.790> and<00:02:25.090> I

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750 
line took it to my sewing machine and I

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.869 
line took it to my sewing machine and I
stitched<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.709> lines<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:29.160> hopefully<00:02:30.160> that

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 
stitched the lines and hopefully that

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.030 
stitched the lines and hopefully that
will<00:02:31.140> because<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.260> know<00:02:32.319> what<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:32.709> want<00:02:32.920> and

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
may have to go over at another time or

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.479 
may have to go over at another time or
to<00:02:37.329> some<00:02:38.200> heavier<00:02:38.590> thread<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:38.950> like<00:02:39.220> to<00:02:39.370> use

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
to some heavier thread I like to use

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.130 
to some heavier thread I like to use
invisible<00:02:39.970> thread<00:02:40.390> whenever<00:02:40.750> I'm<00:02:40.840> stitching

invisible thread whenever I'm stitching

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.780 
invisible thread whenever I'm stitching
if<00:02:41.950> it's<00:02:42.430> not<00:02:42.640> for<00:02:44.310> strength<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.519> doesn't

if it's not for strength it doesn't

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:47.280 
if it's not for strength it doesn't
really<00:02:45.940> matter<00:02:46.239> but<00:02:46.660> I<00:02:46.750> think<00:02:46.930> I'm<00:02:47.049> going<00:02:47.230> to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
really matter but I think I'm going to

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.110 
really matter but I think I'm going to
go<00:02:47.410> back<00:02:47.590> and<00:02:47.769> use<00:02:47.950> some<00:02:48.459> fuchsia<00:02:48.730> thread

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
go back and use some fuchsia thread

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.360 
go back and use some fuchsia thread
regular<00:02:49.569> thread<00:02:49.810> and<00:02:49.959> go<00:02:49.989> back<00:02:50.200> over<00:02:50.349> this<00:02:50.650> so

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
regular thread and go back over this so

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.910 
regular thread and go back over this so
that's<00:02:51.610> where<00:02:51.790> we<00:02:51.940> are<00:02:51.970> so<00:02:52.269> far<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:53.410> I<00:02:53.739> didn't

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
that's where we are so far so I didn't

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.839 
that's where we are so far so I didn't
have<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.099> use<00:02:54.190> any<00:02:54.340> glue<00:02:54.930> didn't<00:02:55.930> have<00:02:56.079> to<00:02:56.200> use

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
have to use any glue didn't have to use

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.539 
have to use any glue didn't have to use
anything<00:02:57.849> but<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.319> usable<00:02:59.319> stuff<00:02:59.739> that<00:03:00.430> the

00:03:00.539 --> 00:03:00.549 
anything but this usable stuff that the

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:02.369 
anything but this usable stuff that the
trick<00:03:00.760> is<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.030> use<00:03:01.329> the<00:03:01.569> parchment<00:03:02.019> paper<00:03:02.049> and

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
trick is to use the parchment paper and

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:03.930 
trick is to use the parchment paper and
won't<00:03:02.560> stick<00:03:02.829> to<00:03:02.980> it<00:03:03.099> also

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
won't stick to it also

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.180 
won't stick to it also
I<00:03:04.379> mean<00:03:05.379> course<00:03:05.620> I'm<00:03:05.739> going<00:03:05.860> to<00:03:05.950> top<00:03:06.160> stitch

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
I mean course I'm going to top stitch

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.270 
I mean course I'm going to top stitch
around<00:03:06.609> this<00:03:06.940> before<00:03:07.269> it's<00:03:07.389> all<00:03:07.510> put<00:03:07.720> together

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
around this before it's all put together

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.629 
around this before it's all put together
and<00:03:09.420> I<00:03:10.420> can<00:03:10.600> do<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.840> same<00:03:11.049> thing<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:12.370> I've<00:03:12.519> got

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
and I can do the same thing and I've got

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:13.979 
and I can do the same thing and I've got
to<00:03:12.730> recut<00:03:13.060> this<00:03:13.239> because<00:03:13.540> I<00:03:13.600> didn't<00:03:13.840> cut<00:03:13.959> it

00:03:13.979 --> 00:03:13.989 
to recut this because I didn't cut it

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:16.890 
to recut this because I didn't cut it
turn<00:03:14.859> my<00:03:15.069> edges<00:03:15.370> under<00:03:15.609> too<00:03:15.760> big<00:03:15.970> but<00:03:16.600> you<00:03:16.750> can

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
turn my edges under too big but you can

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.890 
turn my edges under too big but you can
see<00:03:17.170> I<00:03:17.410> can<00:03:17.620> go<00:03:17.650> back<00:03:17.889> I<00:03:17.920> can<00:03:18.250> iron<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:18.700> down

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
see I can go back I can iron this down

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.090 
see I can go back I can iron this down
I've<00:03:19.900> got<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.139> edges<00:03:20.470> turned<00:03:20.709> under<00:03:20.920> and

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
I've got the edges turned under and

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.860 
I've got the edges turned under and
stitched<00:03:21.459> like<00:03:22.239> I<00:03:22.329> said<00:03:22.480> I'm<00:03:22.569> going<00:03:22.660> to<00:03:22.750> make<00:03:22.840> a

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
stitched like I said I'm going to make a

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.000 
stitched like I said I'm going to make a
new<00:03:23.079> one<00:03:23.170> because<00:03:23.350> this<00:03:23.470> isn't<00:03:23.799> quite<00:03:23.920> big

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
new one because this isn't quite big

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.789 
new one because this isn't quite big
enough<00:03:24.250> duh<00:03:25.200> but<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.260> can<00:03:26.440> iron<00:03:26.590> it<00:03:26.769> down

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
enough duh but I can iron it down

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.220 
enough duh but I can iron it down
because<00:03:27.069> it<00:03:27.340> still<00:03:27.760> has<00:03:28.090> a<00:03:28.420> fusible<00:03:28.930> right

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
because it still has a fusible right

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.710 
because it still has a fusible right
here<00:03:29.470> it's<00:03:29.709> still<00:03:29.950> sticky<00:03:30.430> and<00:03:30.639> that<00:03:31.630> will

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
here it's still sticky and that will

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.020 
here it's still sticky and that will

and of course you know we're going to be

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.199 
and of course you know we're going to be
sure<00:03:41.139> to<00:03:41.290> turn<00:03:41.470> these<00:03:41.709> edges<00:03:42.130> under<00:03:42.489> when<00:03:43.180> I

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
sure to turn these edges under when I

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.199 
sure to turn these edges under when I
top<00:03:43.510> stitch<00:03:43.840> I'll<00:03:44.109> catch<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.760> so<00:03:45.760> I<00:03:45.790> look

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
top stitch I'll catch that so I look

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.569 
top stitch I'll catch that so I look
nice<00:03:46.329> and<00:03:46.569> neat<00:03:46.690> from<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:46.989> outside<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:48.310> I

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:48.579 
nice and neat from the outside and I

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:50.940 
nice and neat from the outside and I
think<00:03:49.150> I<00:03:49.569> might<00:03:49.989> want<00:03:50.200> this<00:03:50.290> to<00:03:50.470> be<00:03:50.590> just<00:03:50.799> a

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 
think I might want this to be just a

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:53.580 
think I might want this to be just a
little<00:03:51.250> stiffer<00:03:51.970> I<00:03:52.230> think<00:03:53.230> what<00:03:53.319> I'm<00:03:53.410> going<00:03:53.560> to

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
little stiffer I think what I'm going to

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.319 
little stiffer I think what I'm going to
do<00:03:53.739> is<00:03:54.010> take<00:03:54.250> some<00:03:54.280> of<00:03:54.519> the<00:03:54.639> chipboard<00:03:54.910> that<00:03:55.269> I

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.479 
do is take some of the chipboard that I
use<00:03:55.510> on<00:03:55.690> the<00:03:55.720> other<00:03:55.930> bag<00:03:56.200> and<00:03:56.849> I<00:03:57.849> can<00:03:58.000> actually

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
use on the other bag and I can actually

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.920 
use on the other bag and I can actually
not<00:04:00.489> sure<00:04:00.639> if<00:04:00.700> I<00:04:00.790> can<00:04:00.849> fuse<00:04:01.419> this<00:04:01.599> from<00:04:01.810> the

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
not sure if I can fuse this from the

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.750 
not sure if I can fuse this from the
other<00:04:02.049> side<00:04:02.319> to<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.709> chipboard<00:04:02.980> I<00:04:03.430> might<00:04:03.609> try

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
other side to the chipboard I might try

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.309 
other side to the chipboard I might try
that<00:04:04.030> I<00:04:04.060> don't<00:04:04.329> know<00:04:04.419> may<00:04:04.840> just<00:04:05.019> leave<00:04:05.169> it<00:04:05.290> like

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
that I don't know may just leave it like

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.259 
that I don't know may just leave it like
it<00:04:05.530> is<00:04:05.590> here<00:04:05.859> and<00:04:05.980> put<00:04:06.130> a<00:04:06.400> piece<00:04:06.910> of<00:04:06.940> chipboard

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
it is here and put a piece of chipboard

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.159 
it is here and put a piece of chipboard
in<00:04:07.599> the<00:04:07.690> bottom<00:04:09.209> anyway<00:04:10.209> that's<00:04:10.630> where<00:04:10.810> I'm<00:04:10.930> at

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.169 
in the bottom anyway that's where I'm at

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:11.700 
in the bottom anyway that's where I'm at
and

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:11.710 
and

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.870 
and
I just<00:04:11.890> wanted<00:04:12.100> to<00:04:12.160> share<00:04:12.340> that<00:04:12.370> with<00:04:12.580> you<00:04:12.730> I

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
I just wanted to share that with you I

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.180 
I just wanted to share that with you I
tried<00:04:13.480> to<00:04:13.630> write<00:04:13.810> it<00:04:13.960> out<00:04:14.140> so<00:04:14.500> I<00:04:14.860> thought<00:04:15.040> maybe

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
tried to write it out so I thought maybe

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.830 
tried to write it out so I thought maybe
it'd<00:04:15.340> be<00:04:15.490> easier<00:04:15.820> to<00:04:15.880> explain<00:04:16.060> it<00:04:16.510> in<00:04:16.600> a<00:04:16.690> video

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
it'd be easier to explain it in a video

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.000 
it'd be easier to explain it in a video
so<00:04:17.590> I'll<00:04:17.650> send<00:04:17.920> this<00:04:18.040> to<00:04:18.100> you<00:04:18.400> by
