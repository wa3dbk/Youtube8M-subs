anywhere you want to and the reason why

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.609 
anywhere you want to and the reason why
I<00:01:44.670> say<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:45.030> down<00:01:45.240> then<00:01:45.840> move<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.259> wherever<00:01:46.470> you

I say up down then move it wherever you
want<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.159> because<00:01:47.399> if<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.610> press<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:47.939> hold

want to is because if you press and hold

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.240 
want to is because if you press and hold
you<00:01:48.689> try<00:01:48.869> to<00:01:48.930> move<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.200> left<00:01:49.350> or<00:01:49.500> right<00:01:49.680> the

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
navigate left to right so best ways

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.840 
navigate left to right so best ways
press<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.170> hold<00:01:55.200> then<00:01:55.860> move<00:01:56.130> it<00:01:56.250> up<00:01:56.399> or<00:01:56.610> down

press and hold then move it up or down

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.810 
press and hold then move it up or down
then<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.719> can<00:01:57.960> put<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.040> anywhere<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.399> want<00:01:59.700> it

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
then you can put it anywhere you want it

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.170 
then you can put it anywhere you want it
to<00:02:00.030> go<00:02:00.409> just<00:02:01.409> like<00:02:01.469> that<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:01.860> this<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:02.969> probably

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
to go just like that or this is probably

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.999 
to go just like that or this is probably
going<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.390> be<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.479> easier<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:03.960> whichever<00:02:04.829> way

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
going to be the easier way whichever way

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.830 
going to be the easier way whichever way
works<00:02:05.189> for<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.520> guess<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:06.540> do<00:02:06.689> a<00:02:06.719> little

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
works for you I guess just do a little

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.839 
works for you I guess just do a little
flick<00:02:07.140> of<00:02:07.290> your<00:02:07.350> finger<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.860> to<00:02:08.489> any<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.759> these

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.950 
icons and it puts up a little check mark
on<00:02:11.879> there<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.480> then<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.140> gives<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> couple

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
on there and then it gives you a couple

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.780 
on there and then it gives you a couple
you<00:02:14.110> can<00:02:14.230> unpin<00:02:14.620> it<00:02:14.650> from<00:02:14.890> the<00:02:15.010> start<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:15.490> can

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
move around the big areas and so let's

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.030 
move around the big areas and so let's
say<00:02:51.130> that<00:02:51.160> we<00:02:52.150> previously<00:02:52.480> made<00:02:53.020> this<00:02:53.350> all<00:02:53.710> of

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
say that we previously made this all of

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.520 
say that we previously made this all of
our<00:02:54.130> game<00:02:54.370> icons<00:02:55.090> if<00:02:55.810> I<00:02:55.960> do<00:02:56.020> a<00:02:56.110> little<00:02:56.230> flick

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
our game icons if I do a little flick

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.350 
our game icons if I do a little flick
then<00:02:57.460> on<00:02:57.580> the<00:02:57.640> very<00:02:57.700> bottom<00:02:57.910> i'm<00:02:58.150> going<00:02:58.300> to

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
then on the very bottom i'm going to

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.240 
then on the very bottom i'm going to
name<00:02:58.600> group<00:02:59.200> so<00:02:59.830> i'm<00:02:59.890> going<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.040> name<00:03:00.190> this

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
name group so i'm going to name this

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.840 
name group so i'm going to name this
group<00:03:00.760> probably<00:03:02.130> actually<00:03:03.130> just<00:03:03.400> do<00:03:03.520> it<00:03:03.670> what

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:03.850 
group probably actually just do it what

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:05.730 
group probably actually just do it what
it's<00:03:04.000> really<00:03:04.240> you<00:03:04.930> know<00:03:05.080> set<00:03:05.410> it<00:03:05.530> right<00:03:05.620> now

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 
it's really you know set it right now
