00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.230
 as a four-channel hannibal teacher 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.410
 load resistance 4 ohm 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.160
 connected 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.800
 on one channel so battery 400 and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.169
 holter voltage imitate 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:30.029
 generator work 14 3 volts so 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:34.000
 head device well and a multimeter 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:35.980
 load current clamp and oscilloscope 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.010
 in order to understand how much the amplifier 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:47.440
 gives exactly the pure signal that 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:50.309
 went so murim that he went 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.309
 go, go, go 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.370
 from the same wash 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:13.300
 everything is there so what's watching us 29.2 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:17.530
 volts or 7.2 amps take imitation 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:23.460
 10 here is 4 ohms so in order to understand 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:28.830
 what is there 210 and on which sky dante we take 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.830
 29 barely divide by 7.2 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.160
 4 4 crazy 4 ohms please 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.700
 amplification fell by 4 channels 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.700
 you are welcome 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.619
 so do the measurements again the teacher 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.060
 Hannibal 4 channel do to understand attacked 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:51.079
 on power what what 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:02:01.180
 up to the maximum what everyone always does 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:02:04.180
 look go go go go 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.180
 go, go, go 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.030
 have so we got thirty three 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:23.780
 and five and seven point nine amperes 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:27.230
 need and that 264 wad on one channel 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:32.930
 at exactly 4 we still divide back what 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:35.319
 there was a valine that these are 4 minds and that 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:39.910
 It turns out 4 and 2 ohms 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.910
 please amplifier hannibal 4 channel 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.440
 so another measurement of the amplifier hannibal 4 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.430
 the channel is now measuring 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:52.530
 see the bridge see what gives the bridge 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.530
 4 ohm impedance amplifier 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:12.590
 so there it is , it turned out fifty three 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.109
 tenths volts and 12 and 10 amps and another 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:19.340
 reminiscent of the measurement bridge let it always 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:23.000
 was not 4 channels the same will get 60 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:25.219
 like 660 here gave mod on 4 hama 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.959
 So we divide that was a pony night light 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:35.359
 resistance here is four point almost 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.810
 4 3 cars skillfully cheeks Sanone 4 

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.189
 channel 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.189
 gives a bridge
