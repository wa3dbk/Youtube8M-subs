00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:12.969
 hello friends with you hulky at will 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.769
 fate in my hangar turned out to be auctions 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:17.770
 Soviet heavy tank of the fifth level and 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.990
 kv-220 I want to say this car is very 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.820
 cool to all fans of powerful 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.670
 armored heavy tanks breakouts 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.850
 sure like i have two for you 

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:30.040
 news and I'll probably start with a bad tank 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.649
 is a promotional buy it in premium 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.079
 the store will not work good wife here 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.899
 is that from September 1 to 8 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.120
 October 2014 for the implementation 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.999
 certain combat missions in the game can 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.070
 get kv-220 and so will not 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:47.769
 pull off nice let's rush in 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.129
 fights give away all in a row on all 220 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:50.379
 volt 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.510
 First, I'll start by saying that the game is on 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.300
 This tank, you will very often 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.329
 get to the top of the list as kv-220 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.699
 has a love level of fights that can't 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.739
 not to please us and just do not push 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.350
 fear well low-level cars when 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.510
 meeting with such a monster here one more 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.830
 plus yes what's the most important there 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.050
 plus is armor 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.510
 it is strong enough from which side 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:16.210
 Penalties for finding the thickness of the armor of the tower 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.730
 is 90 millimeters forehead and era not 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.070
 5 millimeters bead and feed and honest 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.810
 saying booking the tower is much inferior 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.480
 the most important competitor on the fifth 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.880
 level kv-1 but the case is the opposite 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.640
 armored perfectly 100 millimeters forehead 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.800
 and and sides and 8 karma items such 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.840
 armor thickness allows you to tank move 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.300
 sau bol entrance barton yes and if to be up 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.580
 the end of the frank and in karma, not every 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.460
 of possible opponents will be able to break through 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.800
 but if so put rum tuba at all 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.230
 become virtually invulnerable and 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.330
 can fight back to several 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.550
 opponents and effectively deter 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.950
 directions from personal experience I want 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.260
 notice you don't forget your mouth and 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.570
 other high-explosive technology 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:01.300
 shells very often feeling their 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.970
 invulnerability can be punished 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.560
 from art not only big damage but also 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.780
 crew cards and 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.000
 remove after total armor analysis 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.130
 I personally concluded for myself 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.410
 best practice on this tank is 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.260
 an attack in this particular battle we 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.690
 will see thanks to the thick circular defense 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.069
 You can crush the defense of the enemy of course 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.349
 I attach to this not only 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.239
 dignity of the tank but also its head 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:28.180
 don't get close to yourself 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.030
 enemy tlt chic because the dynamics 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.950
 sockets hellish little body turn just 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.920
 only 20 degrees per second 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.110
 fuck he does not work but if something 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.500
 and it will come out applause and perekop 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.430
 Encore he obviously did not receive 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.410
 mediocre mobility is not 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.720
 the only minus kv-220 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.670
 sinful laugh at his weaponry 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.260
 much really inferior if 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.150
 compare it with classmates 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.280
 armor penetration make such and such 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.069
 ninety nine millimeters which is very 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.530
 very little for such a unit and even 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.040
 gun kasaev yes and mixing desires 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.220
 the best 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.110
 Of course this is partly compensated 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.080
 76mm rate of fire 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:11.440
 gun zis-5 can cause an average 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.299
 110 damage per shot at 14 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:15.870
 shots per minute plays into our hands 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.940
 it can allow us to inflict enemies 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:20.739
 1540 damage per minute but this 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.510
 of course with the best confluence 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.670
 circumstances because a number 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.790
 armored tanks such as example 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.100
 kv-1 punch gets complicated there 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.140
 goldie zhko have to charge speed 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.690
 racer among heavyweights tanks 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.470
 call apt-220 we just do not have language 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.630
 will turn 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:39.819
 he is in the charts is wrong 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.430
 so high yes and review it stand out 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.340
 also can not but what am I getting at 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.260
 the fact that all of the above is simple 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.209
 compels a to settle to settle in the bushes 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.420
 retreat with the enemy exclusively in 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.510
 melee yes yes friends this is true 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:59.200
 tyazh you breakthrough tank by the way let's 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:02.049
 touch and the mass of the tank 62 tons and it 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.239
 you are not huhry-mukhry lovers of rams can 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:07.269
 now just jump for joy because 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:09.910
 that such tricks with apt-220 will go off with a bang 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:11.980
 now let's move on to 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.620
 equipment and its what we offer 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.000
 I chose near 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.549
 medium caliber gunner 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.680
 to speed up the charge time by ten 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.490
 percent reinforced aiming drives 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.199
 which will allow us to be quickly reduced and 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.760
 improved ventilation that will give us a plus 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:29.100
 5 percent ownership 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.380
 specialties and skills of all members 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.389
 crew also any of these modules 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.820
 can be changed to enlightened optics 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:39.090
 to compensate for a little small review 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:41.160
 tank to tie up crew personal urine then 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:44.070
 nor has it safely transplanted already 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.960
 coordinated team cisa 7 first thing 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.910
 I have perk fighting brotherhood 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.740
 to give the fighters even more 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.320
 confidence but again plus 5 percent 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:54.750
 to all skill and skill are superfluous not 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.060
 will be further commander in mandatory 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.039
 ok get neither from the third eye 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.229
 see that you are feeling with that 

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:03.510
 the rest of the crew study hard 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.789
 repair if you decide on any 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:08.010
 reasons to plant not yet trained type 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.280
 first of all study commander 

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.860
 light bulb and the rest of the repair as we 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:16.560
 see on the game in the forefront of our apt-220 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.280
 walk selfless and absolutely 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.440
 well 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.419
 but there is another tactic to play on it 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.460
 Of course she is not very suitable for this tank. 

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:25.880
 Fits but you never know what circumstances 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.400
 can make us play defensively 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.300
 for example, well, you decided to proudly wait for enemies 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.669
 at my base 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:35.250
 the best outcomes for you will be just 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:37.050
 find shelter hidden their heroes leave 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.930
 at the same time for the enemy only mask guns 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:42.000
 so old will be oh so hard to get in and 

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.820
 all the more punch but only for me 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.160
 This tactic is just completely and in tatters 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:49.710
 happens to be the full potential of tanks so don't 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.690
 afraid you can go ahead and show 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:54.930
 its allies that they are yours for 

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:57.210
 Stalin you Tina Well, now let's 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.990
 summarize everything we said at the beginning 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.419
 I am this tank 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.580
 clearly did not understand for me was just how 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.770
 not recognized driving a large boulder not 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.349
 having no review for me was 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.840
 wonder why before i do anyone 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:12.599
 I see I need to get dozens from the park 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.620
 there are no penetrations 

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:17.320
 anyone charge well 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:19.930
 but after I transplanted to it 

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.620
 normal crew affair began gentlemen 

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:23.410
 jury 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.360
 super impenetrable armor rapid 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.190
 the gun on top will cover the little 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.590
 one-time damage and low speed 

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:31.900
 mediocre review nice to feel 

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:34.330
 with their hands a powerful tank designed 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.520
 it's nice to be aware of interruptions 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.290
 that you a lot depends on this fight and 

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:41.050
 allies he counts you 

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:43.419
 yeah damn it tv just nice you 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.669
 tank rare guest in random and with 

00:06:43.419 --> 00:06:48.130
 Here you see the base turned tower 

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:51.520
 you and you read the question where did you get this 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:54.550
 the miracle of tank building personally from me kv-220 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:57.520
 deserve great respect he took one 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.430
 from the first places among my tanks on this 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.740
 all friends put likes write 

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:04.060
