00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
much a goal and while we want people to

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.490 
much a goal and while we want people to
be<00:04:14.769> sporting<00:04:15.390> we<00:04:16.390> mostly<00:04:16.900> care<00:04:17.200> that<00:04:17.380> they

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
be sporting we mostly care that they

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.710 
be sporting we mostly care that they
exhibit<00:04:17.950> competitive<00:04:18.940> behavior<00:04:19.390> as<00:04:19.480> opposed

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
to uncompetitive behavior so there are

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.290 
to uncompetitive behavior so there are

obviously<00:04:38.080> we'd<00:04:38.200> like<00:04:38.230> the<00:04:38.590> game<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.980> be

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
obviously we'd like the game to be

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.240 
obviously we'd like the game to be
sporting<00:04:40.150> and<00:04:40.270> friendly<00:04:40.570> at<00:04:40.660> all<00:04:40.810> levels<00:04:41.250> but

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
sporting and friendly at all levels but

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.970 
sporting and friendly at all levels but
we<00:04:42.460> enforce<00:04:42.850> it<00:04:43.000> harder<00:04:43.419> at<00:04:43.540> regular<00:04:44.020> re<00:04:44.200> L<00:04:46.980> for

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:47.980 
we enforce it harder at regular re L for

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.300 
we enforce it harder at regular re L for
regular<00:04:48.340> re<00:04:48.520> L<00:04:48.730> handling<00:04:49.210> errors<00:04:49.419> is<00:04:49.810> done

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
regular re L handling errors is done

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.890 
regular re L handling errors is done
much<00:04:51.310> more<00:04:51.550> on<00:04:51.639> a<00:04:51.730> case<00:04:51.940> by<00:04:52.120> case<00:04:52.150> basis<00:04:52.750> by<00:04:52.870> the

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
much more on a case by case basis by the

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.810 
much more on a case by case basis by the
judge<00:04:53.290> one<00:04:53.830> of<00:04:53.919> the<00:04:53.980> goals<00:04:54.190> of<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:54.400> program<00:04:54.550> is

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
judge one of the goals of the program is

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.180 
judge one of the goals of the program is
consistency<00:04:55.419> which<00:04:56.260> is<00:04:56.290> why<00:04:56.470> we<00:04:56.620> have<00:04:56.740> the<00:04:56.860> IPG

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
consistency which is why we have the IPG

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:00.000 
consistency which is why we have the IPG
it's<00:04:57.700> so<00:04:58.450> that<00:04:58.600> when<00:04:58.720> you<00:04:58.870> go<00:04:59.020> from<00:04:59.290> one

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010 
it's so that when you go from one

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:01.680 
it's so that when you go from one
tournament<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:00.520> another<00:05:00.729> tournament<00:05:01.090> you'll
