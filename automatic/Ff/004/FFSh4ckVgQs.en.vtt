it's<00:01:23.090> actually<00:01:23.420> it's<00:01:23.540> double-sided<00:01:23.840> printing

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
it's actually it's double-sided printing

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.220 
it's actually it's double-sided printing
right<00:01:24.860> now<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:25.970> it's<00:01:26.240> 20<00:01:26.630> pages<00:01:26.810> per<00:01:27.170> minute

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
right now so it's 20 pages per minute

copier<00:02:16.209> printer<00:02:16.690> scanner<00:02:17.910> producing<00:02:18.910> perfect

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
copier printer scanner producing perfect

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.970 
copier printer scanner producing perfect
pretty<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:20.110> thing<00:02:20.350> that<00:02:20.860> I've<00:02:20.950> been

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
pretty this thing that I've been

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.309 
pretty this thing that I've been
double-sided<00:02:21.640> right<00:02:21.910> now<00:02:22.120> the<00:02:22.569> machine<00:02:22.900> says

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
double-sided right now the machine says

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.020 
double-sided right now the machine says
the<00:02:23.680> only<00:02:24.010> done<00:02:25.020> 9,000<00:02:26.020> copies<00:02:26.320> from<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.370> so

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
the only done 9,000 copies from you so

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.820

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
there's a bit more copy completely I

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.580 
there's a bit more copy completely I
should<00:02:32.350> say<00:02:33.060> as<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:34.150> can<00:02:34.269> see<00:02:34.390> hopefully<00:02:34.810> to
