different<00:02:37.980> in<00:02:38.550> the<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.120> sense<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:40.100> the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
different in the in the sense that the

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.580 
different in the in the sense that the
black<00:02:41.310> rook<00:02:41.550> would<00:02:41.700> go<00:02:41.910> now<00:02:42.120> behind<00:02:42.630> White's<00:02:43.290> a

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
black rook would go now behind White's a

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.730 
black rook would go now behind White's a
pawn

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.170 
pawn
that's<00:02:44.950> what<00:02:45.130> happened<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.670> the<00:02:45.730> pond<00:02:45.940> keeps

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
that's what happened and the pond keeps

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.790 
that's what happened and the pond keeps
advancing<00:02:46.330> let's<00:02:46.930> hope<00:02:47.110> our<00:02:47.320> board<00:02:47.590> will

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
advancing let's hope our board will

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.120 
advancing let's hope our board will
refresh<00:02:48.250> here<00:02:48.810> real<00:02:49.810> soon<00:02:50.230> because<00:02:50.470> moves<00:02:50.920> are

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
refresh here real soon because moves are

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.480 
refresh here real soon because moves are
happening<00:02:51.670> in<00:02:51.940> a<00:02:52.210> lightning<00:02:52.540> speed<00:02:53.250> let's<00:02:54.250> see

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
happening in a lightning speed let's see

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:59.040 
happening in a lightning speed let's see
why<00:02:54.670> our<00:02:54.700> board<00:02:55.210> is<00:02:55.330> not<00:02:55.540> refreshing<00:02:58.050> maybe

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
why our board is not refreshing maybe

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:00.960 
why our board is not refreshing maybe
I'll<00:02:59.320> make<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.830> on<00:02:59.920> the<00:03:00.070> analysis<00:03:00.670> board

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
I'll make it on the analysis board

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.130 
I'll make it on the analysis board
manually<00:03:01.690> rotate<00:03:02.530> to<00:03:03.010> a7<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:03.880> King<00:03:04.090> c5<00:03:04.600> as<00:03:04.900> far

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
manually rotate to a7 and King c5 as far

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.350 
manually rotate to a7 and King c5 as far
as<00:03:05.290> we<00:03:05.470> could<00:03:05.590> tell<00:03:05.650> from<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.250> wooden<00:03:06.580> board<00:03:07.060> I

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
as we could tell from the wooden board I

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.040 
as we could tell from the wooden board I
think<00:03:07.870> we<00:03:07.990> can<00:03:08.140> just<00:03:08.350> start<00:03:08.530> once<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:09.870> h1<00:03:10.870> and

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 
think we can just start once the h1 and

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.260 
think we can just start once the h1 and
now<00:03:11.200> the<00:03:11.260> H<00:03:11.620> pawn<00:03:12.070> would<00:03:12.430> start<00:03:12.820> moving

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
now the H pawn would start moving

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.290 
now the H pawn would start moving
forward<00:03:14.100> but<00:03:15.100> still<00:03:15.370> this<00:03:15.550> was<00:03:15.760> blacks<00:03:16.090> only

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
forward but still this was blacks only

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.420 
forward but still this was blacks only
chance<00:03:16.810> and<00:03:17.170> then<00:03:17.320> to<00:03:17.470> start<00:03:17.740> to<00:03:17.980> give<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.400> a

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
chance and then to start to give you a

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.540 
chance and then to start to give you a
check<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:18.820> try<00:03:19.780> to<00:03:19.840> somehow<00:03:20.380> advance<00:03:20.890> that<00:03:21.250> C

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550

trying to stop the coordination let's

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.740 
trying to stop the coordination let's
see<00:03:46.690> if<00:03:46.750> our<00:03:47.550> board<00:03:48.550> refreshes<00:03:49.180> and<00:03:49.210> the<00:03:49.480> dust

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
see if our board refreshes and the dust

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.480 
see if our board refreshes and the dust
so<00:03:50.080> here<00:03:50.320> we<00:03:50.440> are<00:03:50.470> this<00:03:50.770> is<00:03:50.920> the<00:03:51.040> official

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
so here we are this is the official

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.510 
so here we are this is the official
position<00:03:52.000> at<00:03:52.240> the<00:03:52.810> moment<00:03:52.960> we<00:03:53.380> that<00:03:53.530> move<00:03:53.770> 57

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:54.520 
position at the moment we that move 57

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.240 
position at the moment we that move 57
there<00:03:55.120> are<00:03:55.240> only<00:03:55.420> three<00:03:55.930> moves<00:03:56.230> to<00:03:56.470> make<00:03:56.710> until

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
there are only three moves to make until

there are only three moves to make until
the<00:03:57.400> time<00:03:57.580> control<00:03:58.120> time<00:03:58.900> is<00:03:59.110> not<00:03:59.260> the<00:03:59.500> issue

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
the time control time is not the issue

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.310 
the time control time is not the issue
the<00:04:00.010> issue<00:04:00.040> is<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:01.030> white<00:04:01.450> has<00:04:01.750> an<00:04:01.960> extra

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:02.320 
the issue is that white has an extra

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.500 
the issue is that white has an extra
pawn<00:04:02.560> and<00:04:02.830> that<00:04:03.310> extra<00:04:03.610> pony<00:04:03.940> indeed<00:04:04.300> has

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
pawn and that extra pony indeed has

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.800 
pawn and that extra pony indeed has
reached<00:04:05.160> one<00:04:06.160> Square<00:04:06.670> from<00:04:06.970> promotion<00:04:07.660> the

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
reached one Square from promotion the

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.860 
reached one Square from promotion the
seventh<00:04:08.230> rank<00:04:08.500> it<00:04:09.100> it's<00:04:09.730> really<00:04:09.970> sad<00:04:10.390> from

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
seventh rank it it's really sad from

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.570 
seventh rank it it's really sad from
blacks<00:04:11.170> perspective<00:04:11.890> from<00:04:12.130> Ananse

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
blacks perspective from Ananse

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.330 
blacks perspective from Ananse
perspective<00:04:13.390> and<00:04:13.630> I<00:04:14.140> think<00:04:14.170> he<00:04:14.650> knows<00:04:14.860> it<00:04:15.100> even

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
perspective and I think he knows it even

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.000 
perspective and I think he knows it even
though<00:04:16.090> he<00:04:16.299> he<00:04:16.690> hides<00:04:16.960> it<00:04:17.200> pretty<00:04:17.440> well<00:04:17.680> I<00:04:17.739> have

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
though he he hides it pretty well I have

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:20.460 
though he he hides it pretty well I have
to<00:04:18.160> say<00:04:18.430> you<00:04:18.970> can't<00:04:19.299> tell<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:20.049> he<00:04:20.200> may<00:04:20.410> be

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
to say you can't tell that he may be

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:27.530 
to say you can't tell that he may be
minutes<00:04:21.130> away<00:04:21.370> from<00:04:21.520> needing<00:04:22.150> to<00:04:22.330> resign<00:04:22.840> and

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.620 

that<00:04:28.540> that<00:04:28.810> would<00:04:29.050> be<00:04:29.170> a<00:04:29.200> big<00:04:29.620> victory<00:04:30.340> for<00:04:30.630> the

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
that that would be a big victory for the

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.310 
that that would be a big victory for the
challenge<00:04:32.590> he<00:04:32.860> has<00:04:33.130> resigned

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
challenge he has resigned

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.090 
challenge he has resigned
