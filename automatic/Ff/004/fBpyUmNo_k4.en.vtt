the<00:00:21.150> application<00:00:21.630> itself<00:00:22.070> so<00:00:23.070> once<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.340> start

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
the application itself so once you start

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.040 
the application itself so once you start
up<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.789> application<00:00:23.910> this<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.510> basically

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
up the application this is basically

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.920 
up the application this is basically
what<00:00:25.380> you<00:00:25.529> see<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:26.240> once<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.390> tap<00:00:27.539> start

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
what you see and once you tap start

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
it'll start taking the panorama shots so

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.049 
it'll start taking the panorama shots so
you<00:00:30.510> can<00:00:31.050> just<00:00:31.199> tap<00:00:31.439> this<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:32.940> this

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
you can just tap this and you get this

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.389 
you can just tap this and you get this
little<00:00:33.450> three<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.960> memory<00:00:34.290> it's<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.559> little

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
little three to memory it's a little

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.670 
little three to memory it's a little
world<00:00:35.579> that<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.940> can<00:00:36.090> see<00:00:36.960> where<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> photos

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
world that you can see where the photos

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.020 
world that you can see where the photos
are<00:00:37.829> so<00:00:38.070> you<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.309> move<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.579> around<00:00:38.670> like<00:00:38.910> this

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
are so you just move it around like this

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.220 
are so you just move it around like this
and<00:00:40.010> you<00:00:41.010> hear<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> little<00:00:42.059> beep<00:00:42.420> whenever<00:00:42.960> your

and you hear a little beep whenever your

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.860 
and you hear a little beep whenever your
the<00:00:44.090> application<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.360> take<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> photo

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the application is going to take a photo

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.119 
the application is going to take a photo
so<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.260> move<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.530> around<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.149> and<00:00:48.149> just

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
so you move it around like this and just

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:55.610 
so you move it around like this and just
around<00:00:50.129> my<00:00:50.969> room<00:00:51.379> you<00:00:52.379> can<00:00:52.530> look<00:00:52.680> up<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:54.620> look

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
around my room you can look up to look

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.319 
around my room you can look up to look
up<00:00:55.829> there<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.570> can<00:00:57.750> look<00:00:57.899> down

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.930 

like<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.590> sort<00:01:02.489> of

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:03.940 
like that sort of

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.560 
like that sort of
area<00:01:04.930> so<00:01:05.830> there<00:01:06.460> you<00:01:06.550> go<00:01:06.700> that<00:01:07.120> is<00:01:07.150> basically

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
area so there you go that is basically

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.960 
area so there you go that is basically
how<00:01:07.780> it<00:01:07.810> works<00:01:07.930> you<00:01:08.740> can<00:01:08.770> walk<00:01:09.100> around<00:01:09.280> your
