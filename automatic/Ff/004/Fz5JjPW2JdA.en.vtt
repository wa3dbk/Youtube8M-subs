00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:46.539 
and this back casing here is actually a
kickstand<00:01:45.020> which<00:01:45.170> is<00:01:45.320> pretty<00:01:45.560> pretty<00:01:46.219> rare

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
kickstand which is pretty pretty rare

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:48.219 
kickstand which is pretty pretty rare
amongst<00:01:47.060> tabs<00:01:47.240> in<00:01:47.450> jail<00:01:47.600> we<00:01:47.719> know<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:48.049> the

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:48.229 
amongst tabs in jail we know that the

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.399 
amongst tabs in jail we know that the
the<00:01:48.829> surface<00:01:49.640> has<00:01:49.880> it<00:01:50.149> but<00:01:50.450> this<00:01:50.630> also<00:01:50.810> employs

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
the surface has it but this also employs

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.550 
the surface has it but this also employs
a<00:01:51.649> kickstand<00:01:52.039> zone<00:01:52.340> which<00:01:52.490> is<00:01:52.520> very<00:01:52.820> useful

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
a kickstand zone which is very useful

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.440 
a kickstand zone which is very useful
when<00:01:54.560> you<00:01:54.649> open<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:54.950> up<00:01:55.039> you<00:01:55.549> have<00:01:55.579> actually<00:01:56.420> a

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
when you open it up you have actually a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.809 
when you open it up you have actually a
micro<00:01:57.140> SD<00:01:57.500> card<00:01:57.829> slot<00:01:58.159> right<00:01:58.189> there

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
micro SD card slot right there

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.340 
micro SD card slot right there
so<00:01:59.270> you<00:01:59.360> can<00:01:59.479> actually<00:01:59.630> increase<00:02:00.049> its

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
so you can actually increase its
