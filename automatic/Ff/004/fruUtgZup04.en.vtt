00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
this one's good because you can

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.980 
this one's good because you can
commandeer<00:01:41.189> vehicles<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.090> you're<00:01:42.570> not

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
commandeer vehicles but you're not

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.399 
commandeer vehicles but you're not
carjacking<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:44.960> doing<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.229> name<00:01:46.380> of

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
carjacking here doing it in the name of

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.980 
carjacking here doing it in the name of
the<00:01:46.590> law<00:01:46.799> he<00:01:47.340> actually<00:01:47.729> apologizes<00:01:48.390> to<00:01:48.720> people

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
the law he actually apologizes to people

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.800

when<00:01:49.140> he<00:01:49.229> takes<00:01:49.470> their<00:01:49.649> car<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.479> and<00:01:51.479> I<00:01:51.540> played

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
when he takes their car so and I played

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.010 
when he takes their car so and I played
it<00:01:51.899> with<00:01:51.990> my<00:01:52.170> son<00:01:52.439> and<00:01:53.060> he<00:01:54.060> was<00:01:54.090> getting<00:01:54.479> upset

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
it with my son and he was getting upset

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.630 
it with my son and he was getting upset
that<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.259> was<00:01:55.500> destroying<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.219> city

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
that I was destroying the city

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.020 
that I was destroying the city
so<00:01:57.450> it's<00:01:58.290> actually<00:01:58.439> pretty<00:01:58.770> funny<00:01:59.100> but

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 
so it's actually pretty funny but

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.130 
so it's actually pretty funny but
so<00:02:02.030> there<00:02:02.270> you<00:02:02.299> could<00:02:02.540> see<00:02:03.100> I'm<00:02:04.100> talking<00:02:04.340> about

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
so there you could see I'm talking about

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.399 
so there you could see I'm talking about
now

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
now

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.370 
now
I'm<00:02:06.530> not<00:02:06.770> far<00:02:07.159> enough<00:02:07.460> along<00:02:08.420> in<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.810> game<00:02:09.020> to

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
I'm not far enough along in the game to

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.570 
I'm not far enough along in the game to
know<00:02:10.360> but<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.660> I<00:02:12.230> kind<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:12.980> drive<00:02:13.220> tried<00:02:13.489> to

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
know but the I kind of drive tried to

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.250 
know but the I kind of drive tried to
drive<00:02:13.849> up<00:02:14.000> onto<00:02:14.239> the<00:02:14.300> Golden<00:02:14.540> Gate<00:02:14.630> Bridge<00:02:14.690> and

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
drive up onto the Golden Gate Bridge and

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.410 
drive up onto the Golden Gate Bridge and
it<00:02:15.770> was<00:02:15.980> blocked<00:02:16.310> off<00:02:16.580> so<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:16.910> think<00:02:17.000> they<00:02:17.239> might

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
it was blocked off so I think they might

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.630 
it was blocked off so I think they might
be<00:02:17.450> saving<00:02:17.959> that<00:02:18.110> as<00:02:18.410> kind<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.069> a<00:02:19.160> downloadable

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
be saving that as kind of a downloadable

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.420 
be saving that as kind of a downloadable
