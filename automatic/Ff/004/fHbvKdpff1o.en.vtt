demonstrate<00:00:06.509> what<00:00:07.140> we<00:00:07.290> can<00:00:07.470> do<00:00:07.649> with

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
demonstrate what we can do with

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.570 
demonstrate what we can do with
electronic<00:00:08.760> drums<00:00:09.349> we<00:00:10.349> might<00:00:10.559> use<00:00:10.860> electronic

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
electronic drums we might use electronic

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.490 
electronic drums we might use electronic
drums<00:00:11.820> with<00:00:12.120> acoustic<00:00:12.719> drums<00:00:12.990> or<00:00:13.200> instead<00:00:13.440> of

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
drums with acoustic drums or instead of

drums with acoustic drums or instead of
acoustic<00:00:13.980> drums<00:00:14.250> let's<00:00:14.910> see<00:00:15.059> how<00:00:15.179> they're

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
acoustic drums let's see how they're

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.849 
acoustic drums let's see how they're
different<00:00:16.699> acoustic<00:00:17.699> symbol<00:00:18.590> you<00:00:19.590> hit<00:00:19.740> it

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
different acoustic symbol you hit it

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.220 
different acoustic symbol you hit it
very<00:00:19.890> lightly<00:00:21.680> you<00:00:22.680> can<00:00:22.890> hear<00:00:23.900> if<00:00:24.900> you<00:00:25.080> get

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
very lightly you can hear if you get

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:32.799 
very lightly you can hear if you get
louder<00:00:29.420> it<00:00:30.420> will<00:00:30.599> keep<00:00:30.869> getting<00:00:31.439> louder

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
louder it will keep getting louder

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:38.240 
louder it will keep getting louder
electronic<00:00:33.809> symbol<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:36.290> love<00:00:37.290> myself<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:38.010> sit

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
electronic symbol I love myself to sit

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.549 
electronic symbol I love myself to sit
doesn't<00:00:38.460> trigger<00:00:41.809> so<00:00:42.809> there's<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.110> point<00:00:43.379> at

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
doesn't trigger so there's a point at

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.350 
doesn't trigger so there's a point at
which<00:00:43.739> i<00:00:43.950> have<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.160> hit<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.340> hard<00:00:44.670> enough<00:00:44.820> for

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
which i have to hit it hard enough for

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:57.290 
which i have to hit it hard enough for
me<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.629> make<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> stop<00:00:55.550> acoustic<00:00:56.550> drum<00:00:56.820> same

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
me to make a stop acoustic drum same

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:08.399 
me to make a stop acoustic drum same
thing<00:00:57.949> soft

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:22.930

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
electronic drum so the dynamic range is

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.840 
electronic drum so the dynamic range is
much<00:01:23.360> different<00:01:23.979> what's<00:01:24.979> more<00:01:25.159> limited<00:01:25.670> with

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
much different what's more limited with

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.910 
much different what's more limited with
electronics<00:01:28.090> you<00:01:29.090> hit<00:01:29.390> any<00:01:30.200> part<00:01:30.530> of<00:01:30.560> the<00:01:30.680> drum

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
electronics you hit any part of the drum

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.830 
electronics you hit any part of the drum
and<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.280> pretty<00:01:31.430> much<00:01:31.520> sounds<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.060> same<00:01:32.300> the

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
and it pretty much sounds the same the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.139 
and it pretty much sounds the same the
symbol<00:01:33.290> with<00:01:33.860> an<00:01:33.979> acoustic<00:01:34.220> tremor<00:01:34.670> symbol

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:35.149 
symbol with an acoustic tremor symbol

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:37.270 
symbol with an acoustic tremor symbol
the<00:01:35.479> sound<00:01:35.720> changes<00:01:36.020> as<00:01:36.500> you<00:01:36.530> change<00:01:36.740> where

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
the sound changes as you change where

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.850 
the sound changes as you change where
you're<00:01:37.399> hitting<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.909> drummer<00:01:38.600> symbol<00:01:39.050> it's

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
you're hitting the drummer symbol it's

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.410 
you're hitting the drummer symbol it's
another<00:01:40.070> area<00:01:40.460> where<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.820> electronic<00:01:41.210> drums

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
another area where the electronic drums

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.830 
another area where the electronic drums
are<00:01:41.570> more<00:01:41.720> limited<00:01:41.929> nets<00:01:42.440> and<00:01:42.740> just<00:01:43.840> dynamic

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
are more limited nets and just dynamic

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.910 
are more limited nets and just dynamic
feel<00:01:45.229> so<00:01:47.080> something<00:01:48.080> like<00:01:48.110> the<00:01:48.320> snare<00:01:48.590> drummer

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
feel so something like the snare drummer

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.859 
feel so something like the snare drummer
the<00:01:49.100> hi-hat<00:01:49.550> where<00:01:50.149> you<00:01:50.240> can<00:01:50.360> have<00:01:50.509> a<00:01:50.539> lot<00:01:50.840> of

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
the hi-hat where you can have a lot of

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.700 
the hi-hat where you can have a lot of
feel<00:01:51.770> on<00:01:52.460> an<00:01:52.759> acoustic<00:01:53.000> stuff<00:01:53.420> you<00:01:54.380> can't

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
feel on an acoustic stuff you can't

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.830 
feel on an acoustic stuff you can't
really<00:01:55.100> do<00:01:55.460> those<00:01:55.670> same<00:01:55.940> things<00:01:56.330> on

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
really do those same things on

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.760 
really do those same things on
electronics<00:01:57.710> let<00:01:58.670> me<00:01:58.759> see<00:01:58.909> if<00:01:59.000> I<00:01:59.060> can

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
electronics let me see if I can

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.710 
electronics let me see if I can
demonstrate<00:02:00.770> the<00:02:01.250> limitations<00:02:02.119> without

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
demonstrate the limitations without

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:19.360 
demonstrate the limitations without
looking<00:02:03.200> too<00:02:03.490> too<00:02:04.490> bad<00:02:04.729> here<00:02:18.100> most<00:02:19.100> of<00:02:19.280> what

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
looking too too bad here most of what

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.310 
looking too too bad here most of what
I'm<00:02:19.519> presenting<00:02:20.180> suggests<00:02:20.900> that<00:02:20.959> I<00:02:21.110> like

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.320 
I'm presenting suggests that I like

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.400 
I'm presenting suggests that I like
electronics<00:02:22.010> and<00:02:22.220> that<00:02:22.670> is<00:02:22.820> the<00:02:22.970> case

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
electronics and that is the case

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.900 
electronics and that is the case
probably<00:02:24.410> my<00:02:24.560> favorite<00:02:25.100> thing<00:02:25.370> about<00:02:25.579> the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
probably my favorite thing about the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.259 
probably my favorite thing about the
electronic<00:02:26.420> kit<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.810> that<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:27.470> can<00:02:27.680> move<00:02:28.269> the

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
electronic kit is that you can move the

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.539 
electronic kit is that you can move the
volume<00:02:29.750> of<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:29.989> drums<00:02:30.260> away<00:02:30.799> from<00:02:31.040> your<00:02:31.190> ears

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 
volume of the drums away from your ears

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.780 
volume of the drums away from your ears
a<00:02:32.290> challenge<00:02:33.290> especially<00:02:33.410> live<00:02:34.040> is<00:02:34.430> hearing

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
a challenge especially live is hearing

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.699 
a challenge especially live is hearing
everything<00:02:35.030> one<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:35.959> reasons<00:02:36.140> is<00:02:36.560> an

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
everything one of the reasons is an

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.060 
everything one of the reasons is an
acoustic<00:02:36.950> drum<00:02:37.459> set<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:37.820> so<00:02:38.090> loud<00:02:38.829> that's<00:02:39.829> all

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
acoustic drum set is so loud that's all

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.160 
acoustic drum set is so loud that's all
by<00:02:40.280> your<00:02:40.489> ears<00:02:40.790> and<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.299> other<00:02:41.480> style<00:02:41.840> has<00:02:42.019> to

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
by your ears and the other style has to

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.740 
by your ears and the other style has to
come<00:02:42.380> through<00:02:42.410> that<00:02:43.030> to<00:02:44.030> get<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.360> yours<00:02:44.510> and

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
come through that to get to yours and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.560 
come through that to get to yours and
they<00:02:44.930> have<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.350> turn<00:02:45.590> up<00:02:45.850> in<00:02:46.850> order<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.269> hear

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
they have to turn up in order to hear

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.840 
they have to turn up in order to hear
themselves<00:02:47.840> too<00:02:48.440> because<00:02:48.829> a<00:02:48.860> lot<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.190> drums<00:02:49.459> so

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
themselves too because a lot of drums so

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.300 
themselves too because a lot of drums so
but<00:02:50.840> electronic<00:02:51.320> drums<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.739> move<00:02:51.920> the<00:02:52.070> sound

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
but electronic drums you move the sound

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.940 
but electronic drums you move the sound
away<00:02:52.640> from<00:02:52.850> your<00:02:52.970> ears<00:02:53.620> everybody<00:02:54.620> gets<00:02:54.829> a

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
away from your ears everybody gets a

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.230 
away from your ears everybody gets a
balanced<00:02:56.230> volume
