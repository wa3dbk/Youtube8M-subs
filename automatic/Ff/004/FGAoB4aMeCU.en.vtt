00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.520 

what<00:01:25.630> activated<00:01:27.720> that's<00:01:28.720> all<00:01:28.930> I<00:01:29.200> mean<00:01:29.350> about

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
what activated that's all I mean about

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.600 
what activated that's all I mean about
one<00:01:29.710> point<00:01:29.860> it<00:01:30.010> was<00:01:30.040> all<00:01:30.190> coming<00:01:30.370> downhill
