yellow oval surrounding a black bat now

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.270 
yellow oval surrounding a black bat now
that<00:02:29.430> was<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.410> costume<00:02:31.410> I<00:02:31.530> was<00:02:31.680> most<00:02:31.860> used<00:02:32.099> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
that was the costume I was most used to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.850

back<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:36.110> for<00:02:37.110> a<00:02:37.140> while<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.440> thought<00:02:37.830> this

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
back and for a while I thought this

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:40.309 
back and for a while I thought this
bigger<00:02:38.459> bat<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.060> chest<00:02:39.330> was<00:02:39.630> just<00:02:39.810> corny<00:02:40.140> I

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
bigger bat on the chest was just corny I

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.780 
bigger bat on the chest was just corny I
I<00:02:40.470> said<00:02:40.680> that's<00:02:41.190> corny

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
I said that's corny

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.729 
I said that's corny
I<00:02:41.819> like<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.630> Michael<00:02:42.870> Keaton<00:02:43.290> variation

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
I like the Michael Keaton variation

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.250 
I like the Michael Keaton variation
better<00:02:43.950> over<00:02:44.670> time<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.480> opinion<00:02:45.750> changed

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
better over time that opinion changed

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.320 
better over time that opinion changed
and<00:02:46.440> I<00:02:46.799> liked<00:02:47.549> it<00:02:47.670> better<00:02:47.760> when<00:02:47.940> he<00:02:48.030> has<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
and I liked it better when he has the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.870 
and I liked it better when he has the
big<00:02:48.480> black<00:02:48.739> bat<00:02:49.739> emblazoned<00:02:50.459> across<00:02:50.519> his

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
big black bat emblazoned across his

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.970 
big black bat emblazoned across his
chest<00:02:51.180> that<00:02:51.840> might<00:02:52.440> be<00:02:52.590> one<00:02:52.680> of<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.830> reasons

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
chest that might be one of the reasons

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:55.430 
chest that might be one of the reasons
why<00:02:53.250> I<00:02:53.310> think<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.819> Batman<00:02:54.209> figure<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.260> new

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
why I think the Batman figure the new

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.650 
why I think the Batman figure the new
Batman<00:02:55.769> Incorporated<00:02:55.890> series<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.970> no<00:02:57.450> good

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
Batman Incorporated series is no good

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.150 
Batman Incorporated series is no good
because<00:02:57.870> he<00:02:58.049> does<00:02:58.200> have<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.470> Michael<00:02:58.799> Keaton

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
because he does have that Michael Keaton

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.330 
because he does have that Michael Keaton
logo<00:02:59.489> I'm<00:03:00.299> at<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.480> rate<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.200> think<00:03:01.739> this<00:03:02.130> is<00:03:02.250> the

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
logo I'm at a rate I think this is the

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.630 
logo I'm at a rate I think this is the
best<00:03:02.580> representation<00:03:03.230> he<00:03:04.230> is<00:03:04.470> his<00:03:04.950> standard

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
best representation he is his standard

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.780 
best representation he is his standard
gray<00:03:06.000> and<00:03:06.299> blue<00:03:07.069> colors<00:03:08.069> now<00:03:08.310> be<00:03:08.430> nice<00:03:08.549> from

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
gray and blue colors now be nice from

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.580 
gray and blue colors now be nice from
the<00:03:08.819> hush<00:03:09.060> line<00:03:09.330> the<00:03:09.630> colors<00:03:10.049> I<00:03:10.080> thought<00:03:10.410> in

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
the hush line the colors I thought in

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.140 
the hush line the colors I thought in
this<00:03:10.739> line<00:03:10.920> were<00:03:11.069> a<00:03:11.130> lot<00:03:11.280> more<00:03:11.430> vibrant<00:03:11.700> they

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
this line were a lot more vibrant they

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.509 
this line were a lot more vibrant they
kind<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.390> pop<00:03:12.630> a<00:03:12.660> lot<00:03:12.930> more<00:03:13.170> I<00:03:13.950> think<00:03:14.130> the

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
kind of pop a lot more I think the

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.270 
kind of pop a lot more I think the
jawline<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.390> the<00:03:15.930> face<00:03:16.260> here<00:03:16.680> are<00:03:16.860> just

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
jawline and the face here are just

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.520 
jawline and the face here are just
spot-on<00:03:18.030> it's<00:03:18.480> pretty<00:03:18.720> close<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.200> square

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
spot-on it's pretty close to the square

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.210 
spot-on it's pretty close to the square
jaw<00:03:19.799> that<00:03:20.130> they<00:03:20.760> had<00:03:21.000> on<00:03:21.299> the<00:03:21.480> animated<00:03:21.840> series

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
jaw that they had on the animated series

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:24.680 
jaw that they had on the animated series
which<00:03:23.220> I'm<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.459> fan<00:03:23.700> of<00:03:23.730> they<00:03:24.269> also<00:03:24.420> have<00:03:24.600> the

arm<00:05:09.419> right<00:05:09.600> here<00:05:10.370> and<00:05:11.370> replace<00:05:11.880> them<00:05:12.090> if<00:05:12.330> if

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
arm right here and replace them if if

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.010 
arm right here and replace them if if
you<00:05:13.229> want<00:05:13.380> to<00:05:13.440> see<00:05:13.710> that<00:05:14.030> let<00:05:15.030> me<00:05:15.060> just<00:05:15.389> put

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
you want to see that let me just put

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:22.240 
you want to see that let me just put
this<00:05:16.199> here<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:19.520> tradies<00:05:20.520> out

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:22.250 
this here and tradies out

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:26.180 
this here and tradies out
okay<00:05:23.250> so<00:05:23.310> snapping<00:05:23.910> it<00:05:24.000> off<00:05:25.039> takes<00:05:26.039> a<00:05:26.100> little

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:26.190 
okay so snapping it off takes a little

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.320 
okay so snapping it off takes a little
bit<00:05:26.340> of<00:05:26.400> work<00:05:26.550> always<00:05:26.760> makes<00:05:27.000> me<00:05:27.090> feel<00:05:27.150> like

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
bit of work always makes me feel like

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.010 
bit of work always makes me feel like
when<00:05:27.419> a<00:05:27.449> pretty<00:05:27.750> kid

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:30.020 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.810 

so<00:05:31.020> there<00:05:31.169> you<00:05:31.200> have<00:05:31.289> it<00:05:32.180> is<00:05:33.180> his<00:05:34.820> grappling

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
so there you have it is his grappling

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.580 
so there you have it is his grappling
hook<00:05:36.120> I<00:05:36.270> guess<00:05:36.389> you<00:05:36.539> can<00:05:36.720> position<00:05:37.349> it<00:05:37.530> like

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:37.590 
hook I guess you can position it like

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.890 
hook I guess you can position it like
that<00:05:38.510> move<00:05:39.510> his<00:05:39.660> head<00:05:39.810> up<00:05:41.570> so<00:05:42.570> it<00:05:42.630> looks<00:05:42.750> like

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
that move his head up so it looks like

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.909 
that move his head up so it looks like
he<00:05:43.169> is<00:05:43.200> going<00:05:43.740> to<00:05:44.070> grapple<00:05:44.550> somewhere<00:05:45.740> as<00:05:46.740> far

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 
he is going to grapple somewhere as far

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:51.290 
he is going to grapple somewhere as far
as<00:05:46.950> mobility<00:05:47.190> he<00:05:47.729> does<00:05:47.880> move<00:05:48.240> at<00:05:49.200> the<00:05:49.620> hips<00:05:50.550> see

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
as mobility he does move at the hips see

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.879 
as mobility he does move at the hips see
those<00:05:51.479> joints<00:05:52.130> moves<00:05:53.130> here<00:05:53.520> the<00:05:53.760> knees<00:05:54.650> and<00:05:55.650> he

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
those joints moves here the knees and he

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.000 
those joints moves here the knees and he
can<00:05:56.039> move<00:05:56.160> with<00:05:56.310> the<00:05:56.430> elbows<00:05:57.320> and<00:05:58.320> also<00:05:58.740> he<00:05:58.919> has

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
can move with the elbows and also he has

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.420 
can move with the elbows and also he has
these<00:05:59.190> joints<00:05:59.789> on<00:05:59.910> the<00:05:59.940> side<00:06:00.240> so<00:06:01.160> they<00:06:02.160> just<00:06:02.310> go

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:02.430 
these joints on the side so they just go

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:03.650 
these joints on the side so they just go
up<00:06:02.460> and<00:06:02.699> down<00:06:02.789> though<00:06:03.000> his<00:06:03.150> arms<00:06:03.360> go<00:06:03.479> up<00:06:03.539> and

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:03.660 
up and down though his arms go up and

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:06.650 
up and down though his arms go up and
down<00:06:03.750> they<00:06:03.870> don't<00:06:03.930> go<00:06:04.080> out<00:06:05.210> do<00:06:06.210> you<00:06:06.300> sidon<00:06:06.539> have

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
down they don't go out do you sidon have

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.260 
down they don't go out do you sidon have
as<00:06:06.750> much<00:06:06.840> mobility<00:06:07.080> back<00:06:07.590> in<00:06:07.800> the<00:06:08.270> hutch

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
as much mobility back in the hutch

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:10.960 
as much mobility back in the hutch
series<00:06:09.780> I<00:06:09.900> think<00:06:09.960> these<00:06:10.169> are<00:06:10.320> actually<00:06:10.620> from

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:10.970 
series I think these are actually from

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.219 
series I think these are actually from
2004<00:06:12.470> so<00:06:13.470> the<00:06:14.070> line<00:06:14.930> doesn't<00:06:15.930> always<00:06:16.020> have<00:06:16.169> the

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:16.229 
2004 so the line doesn't always have the
