00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
into it rather than just queuing up and

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.449

immediately snapping to it and I know

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:25.490 
immediately snapping to it and I know
this<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.880> something<00:03:24.120> that<00:03:24.480> is<00:03:25.020> we're

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
this is something that is we're

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.740 
this is something that is we're

continuing to see in more and more MMOs

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.600 
continuing to see in more and more MMOs
that<00:03:27.990> come<00:03:28.170> out<00:03:28.350> but<00:03:28.950> even<00:03:29.280> things<00:03:29.520> like

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
that come out but even things like

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.760 
that come out but even things like
flying<00:03:30.120> mounts<00:03:30.630> and<00:03:30.810> decreasing<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.410> time<00:03:31.620> it

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
flying mounts and decreasing the time it

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.860 
flying mounts and decreasing the time it
takes<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:32.010> travel<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.790> think<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.420> sort<00:03:33.570> of<00:03:33.660> takes

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
takes to travel I think it sort of takes

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.690 
takes to travel I think it sort of takes
away<00:03:34.050> from<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.440> mystique<00:03:34.890> of<00:03:35.010> the<00:03:35.160> world<00:03:35.400> so

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:35.700
