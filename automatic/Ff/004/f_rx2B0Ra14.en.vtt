click your dog gets a free treat and you

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.220 
click your dog gets a free treat and you
might<00:02:32.910> get<00:02:33.120> a<00:02:33.150> behavior<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.840> don't

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
might get a behavior that you don't

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.259 
might get a behavior that you don't
really<00:02:34.470> want<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.400> clicker<00:02:35.640> timing<00:02:36.150> and

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
really want so clicker timing and

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.950 
really want so clicker timing and
mechanics<00:02:36.720> are<00:02:36.810> very<00:02:36.950> important
