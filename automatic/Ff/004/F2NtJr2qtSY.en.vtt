00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
during the fast but when I break that

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.420 
during the fast but when I break that
fast<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.650> you<00:01:37.710> can<00:01:37.829> argue<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.159> it's<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
fast and you can argue that it's a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.600 
fast and you can argue that it's a
mental<00:01:38.790> thing<00:01:38.820> as<00:01:39.060> well<00:01:39.210> I<00:01:39.479> need<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.170> eat<00:01:40.320> more

getting enough nutrients in during the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.020 
getting enough nutrients in during the
course<00:01:45.270> of<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.630> day<00:01:45.860> to<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.579> make<00:01:47.729> me<00:01:47.820> feel

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
satiated and when I say new trains have

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.990 
satiated and when I say new trains have

literally a way shake in water and a
handful<00:01:53.220> of<00:01:53.280> Alex<00:01:53.640> there's<00:01:54.000> nothing<00:01:54.360> wrong

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540

with that or walnut or whatever maybe a
little<00:01:56.280> broccoli<00:01:56.790> but<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.780> have<00:01:57.930> found<00:01:58.170> with

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
little broccoli but I have found with

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.590 
little broccoli but I have found with
fasting<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:59.130> end<00:01:59.460> up<00:01:59.549> eating<00:01:59.759> bigger<00:02:00.090> meals<00:02:00.420> and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
fasting I end up eating bigger meals and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.429 
fasting I end up eating bigger meals and
I<00:02:00.689> end<00:02:00.840> up<00:02:00.960> picky

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
I end up picky

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.319 
I end up picky
and<00:02:01.710> that's<00:02:01.890> not<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.369> say<00:02:02.609> fasting<00:02:03.030> doesn't

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
and that's not to say fasting doesn't

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:04.730 
and that's not to say fasting doesn't
work<00:02:03.479> especially<00:02:03.869> does<00:02:04.049> work<00:02:04.229> I<00:02:04.289> still<00:02:04.469> do<00:02:04.590> do
