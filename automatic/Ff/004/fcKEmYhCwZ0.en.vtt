00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
these products and I think they just

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:08.580 
these products and I think they just
catered<00:04:07.640> to<00:04:07.730> two<00:04:07.880> different<00:04:08.270> kind<00:04:08.450> of

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
catered to two different kind of

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.640 
catered to two different kind of
collecting<00:04:09.590> and<00:04:10.340> collecting<00:04:11.260> styles<00:04:12.260> I<00:04:12.470> guess

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 
collecting and collecting styles I guess

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.580
