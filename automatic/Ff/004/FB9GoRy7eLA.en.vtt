00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
in the sand after a gnarly wipeout that

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.900 
in the sand after a gnarly wipeout that
was<00:00:46.930> totally<00:00:47.200> radical<00:00:47.710> and<00:00:48.190> then<00:00:48.370> you<00:00:48.880> a

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
was totally radical and then you a

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.910 
was totally radical and then you a
medallion<00:00:49.300> around<00:00:49.510> your<00:00:49.750> neck<00:00:49.899> or<00:00:50.500> a<00:00:50.559> pendant

I<00:00:51.309> guess<00:00:51.610> is<00:00:51.730> what<00:00:51.760> they<00:00:51.969> call<00:00:52.120> it<00:00:52.300> and<00:00:52.480> you

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
I guess is what they call it and you

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.420 
I guess is what they call it and you
can't<00:00:52.989> take<00:00:53.170> it<00:00:53.290> off<00:00:53.379> until<00:00:53.770> you<00:00:54.040> break<00:00:54.280> the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
can't take it off until you break the

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.910 
can't take it off until you break the
curse<00:00:54.640> and<00:00:55.030> so<00:00:55.719> this<00:00:55.930> crazy<00:00:56.230> lady<00:00:56.500> with<00:00:56.739> like

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
curse and so this crazy lady with like

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.380 
curse and so this crazy lady with like
fire<00:00:57.250> in<00:00:57.460> your<00:00:57.579> eyes<00:00:57.640> is<00:00:57.969> telling<00:00:58.239> you<00:00:58.300> this

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
fire in your eyes is telling you this

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.819 
fire in your eyes is telling you this
because<00:00:58.570> she's<00:00:58.809> obviously<00:00:59.140> been<00:00:59.350> possessed

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
because she's obviously been possessed

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.040 
because she's obviously been possessed
by<00:00:59.920> the<00:00:59.980> demon<00:01:00.250> of<00:01:00.489> the<00:01:00.550> curse<00:01:00.850> so<00:01:01.629> that's<00:01:01.870> why

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
by the demon of the curse so that's why

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.600 
by the demon of the curse so that's why
you<00:01:02.079> know<00:01:02.350> her<00:01:02.500> hair<00:01:02.860> is<00:01:02.980> just<00:01:03.010> blowing<00:01:03.340> in<00:01:03.550> the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
you know her hair is just blowing in the

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.100 
you know her hair is just blowing in the
breeze<00:01:03.640> indefinitely<00:01:04.390> while<00:01:04.570> your<00:01:04.750> hats<00:01:04.930> not

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
breeze indefinitely while your hats not

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.020 
breeze indefinitely while your hats not
even<00:01:05.320> moving<00:01:05.470> at<00:01:05.649> all<00:01:05.830> even<00:01:06.580> though<00:01:06.700> her<00:01:06.850> hair

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
even moving at all even though her hair

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.790 
even moving at all even though her hair
is<00:01:07.119> blowing<00:01:07.270> backwards<00:01:07.869> but<00:01:08.350> yet<00:01:08.440> the<00:01:08.560> clouds

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
is blowing backwards but yet the clouds

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.260 
is blowing backwards but yet the clouds
are<00:01:08.950> moving<00:01:09.070> to<00:01:09.399> the<00:01:09.580> left<00:01:09.610> which<00:01:10.119> would

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:10.270 
are moving to the left which would

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.460 
are moving to the left which would
suggest<00:01:10.420> that<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.840> wind<00:01:11.050> should<00:01:11.229> be<00:01:11.320> blowing

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
suggest that the wind should be blowing

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.830 
suggest that the wind should be blowing
her<00:01:11.680> hair<00:01:11.710> towards<00:01:12.100> her<00:01:12.220> face<00:01:12.430> so<00:01:13.420> anyway<00:01:13.780> is

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
her hair towards her face so anyway is

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.180 
her hair towards her face so anyway is
because<00:01:14.259> you<00:01:14.440> know<00:01:14.530> i'm<00:01:14.680> sure<00:01:14.860> they<00:01:14.979> really

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:15.190 
because you know i'm sure they really

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.130 
because you know i'm sure they really

people who actually wanted a sequel to
this<00:01:42.520> and<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.960> might<00:01:44.350> be<00:01:44.500> wrong<00:01:44.680> on<00:01:44.860> this<00:01:45.070> I

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
this and I might be wrong on this I

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.590 
this and I might be wrong on this I
think<00:01:45.790> that<00:01:46.060> for<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.329> short<00:01:46.659> time<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:48.159> was<00:01:48.600> like

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
think that for a short time it was like

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.910 
think that for a short time it was like
there<00:01:49.840> was<00:01:49.869> kind<00:01:50.079> of<00:01:50.170> like<00:01:50.290> a<00:01:50.350> movement<00:01:50.799> there

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
there was kind of like a movement there

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.380 
there was kind of like a movement there
to<00:01:51.009> like<00:01:51.130> get<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.460> sequel<00:01:51.820> actually<00:01:52.180> made

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
to like get that sequel actually made

activate the first one first which the

00:04:31.569 --> 00:04:33.779 
activate the first one first which the
SI<00:04:31.870> con<00:04:32.110> is<00:04:32.379> basically<00:04:33.069> a<00:04:33.099> possessed<00:04:33.400> frisbee

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
get near including the piranhas so you

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.490 
get near including the piranhas so you
can<00:04:37.240> pretty<00:04:37.360> much<00:04:37.449> just<00:04:37.690> like<00:04:37.900> go<00:04:38.139> straight

laying waste to the islands to the

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.939 
laying waste to the islands to the
indigenous<00:05:04.930> wildlife<00:05:05.080> of<00:05:05.469> the<00:05:05.500> islands<00:05:05.830> it's

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
indigenous wildlife of the islands it's

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.459 
indigenous wildlife of the islands it's
not<00:05:06.069> even<00:05:06.250> a<00:05:06.310> contest<00:05:06.490> and<00:05:07.360> somehow<00:05:08.169> you<00:05:08.319> still

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:08.469 
not even a contest and somehow you still

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:09.749 
not even a contest and somehow you still
have<00:05:08.740> a<00:05:08.770> frisbee<00:05:09.009> too<00:05:09.310> so<00:05:09.430> I<00:05:09.490> guess<00:05:09.520> it<00:05:09.729> just

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
have a frisbee too so I guess it just

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:11.159 
have a frisbee too so I guess it just
makes<00:05:10.000> a<00:05:10.090> new<00:05:10.180> frisbee<00:05:10.509> out<00:05:10.599> of<00:05:10.690> thin<00:05:10.840> air<00:05:10.870> or

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:11.169 
makes a new frisbee out of thin air or

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:19.890 
makes a new frisbee out of thin air or
something<00:05:18.030> not<00:05:19.030> really<00:05:19.120> sure<00:05:19.389> why<00:05:19.539> all<00:05:19.719> the

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:19.900 
something not really sure why all the

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.779 
something not really sure why all the
food<00:05:20.169> which<00:05:20.919> should<00:05:21.219> be<00:05:21.340> restoring<00:05:21.699> your
