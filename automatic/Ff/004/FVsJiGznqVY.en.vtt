00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
the two most horrible places I think to

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:41.309 
the two most horrible places I think to
get<00:01:37.999> tattooed<00:01:38.389> on<00:01:38.509> your<00:01:38.599> arm<00:01:39.279> yeah<00:01:40.279> it<00:01:40.520> sucked

get tattooed on your arm yeah it sucked
between<00:01:42.319> the<00:01:42.439> two<00:01:42.709> I<00:01:43.130> would<00:01:43.490> have<00:01:43.729> to<00:01:43.849> say<00:01:43.880> the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
between the two I would have to say the

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.809 
between the two I would have to say the
wrist<00:01:44.779> hurt<00:01:45.139> more<00:01:45.439> I<00:01:45.709> couldn't<00:01:46.490> remember

wrist hurt more I couldn't remember

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:48.489
