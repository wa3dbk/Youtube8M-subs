think I'm a very good password just

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.969 
think I'm a very good password just
because<00:01:22.840> of<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.080> office<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.500> we're<00:01:23.650> in<00:01:23.740> but

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
because of the office that we're in but

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.040 
because of the office that we're in but
I<00:01:24.220> believe<00:01:24.850> I<00:01:24.970> believe<00:01:25.000> in<00:01:25.270> my<00:01:25.479> skill<00:01:25.750> set<00:01:25.960> in

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
I believe I believe in my skill set in

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.580 
I believe I believe in my skill set in
that<00:01:26.170> I<00:01:26.649> think<00:01:27.009> I'm<00:01:27.250> more<00:01:27.430> than<00:01:27.520> capable<00:01:28.590> how's

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
that I think I'm more than capable how's

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.020 
that I think I'm more than capable how's
your<00:01:29.800> arm<00:01:30.009> strength<00:01:32.190> do<00:01:33.190> you<00:01:33.250> have<00:01:33.340> a<00:01:33.369> favorite

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
your arm strength do you have a favorite

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:52.080 
your arm strength do you have a favorite
route<00:01:34.240> or<00:01:48.630> but<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:51.250> I<00:01:51.490> guess<00:01:51.789> what's<00:01:52.030> the

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
route or but what I guess what's the

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.389 
route or but what I guess what's the
mindset<00:01:52.360> so<00:01:52.869> that<00:01:53.020> you<00:01:53.140> guys<00:01:53.289> can<00:01:53.560> feel<00:01:54.220> that

00:01:54.389 --> 00:01:54.399 
mindset so that you guys can feel that

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.070 
mindset so that you guys can feel that
you<00:01:54.490> guys<00:01:54.580> can<00:01:54.910> live<00:01:55.630> up<00:01:55.810> to<00:01:55.840> your

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
you guys can live up to your

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.929 
you guys can live up to your
expectations<00:01:57.030> I<00:01:58.030> think<00:01:58.570> it's<00:01:58.900> just<00:01:59.020> you<00:01:59.650> know

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
expectations I think it's just you know

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:03.090 
expectations I think it's just you know
making<00:02:00.939> the<00:02:01.150> driller<00:02:01.360> faithful<00:02:01.780> proud<00:02:02.080> no<00:02:02.979> we

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
making the driller faithful proud no we

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.469 
making the driller faithful proud no we
kind<00:02:03.250> of<00:02:03.400> feel<00:02:03.549> like<00:02:03.580> we<00:02:03.790> let<00:02:03.970> everyone<00:02:04.210> down

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
kind of feel like we let everyone down

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.359 
kind of feel like we let everyone down
last<00:02:04.810> year<00:02:05.020> some<00:02:05.380> including<00:02:05.680> ourselves<00:02:05.890> and

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
last year some including ourselves and

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.219 
last year some including ourselves and
our<00:02:07.030> coaches<00:02:07.420> and<00:02:07.450> we<00:02:07.630> don't<00:02:07.810> want<00:02:07.930> to<00:02:07.990> do<00:02:08.110> that

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
our coaches and we don't want to do that

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.770 
our coaches and we don't want to do that
in<00:02:08.380> this<00:02:08.470> year<00:02:08.739> I<00:02:09.130> think<00:02:09.280> we<00:02:09.579> we<00:02:10.390> had<00:02:10.479> a<00:02:10.509> lot<00:02:10.570> of

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:10.780 
in this year I think we we had a lot of

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.330 
in this year I think we we had a lot of
potential<00:02:11.140> last<00:02:11.440> year<00:02:11.650> but<00:02:11.920> we<00:02:12.100> didn't

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
potential last year but we didn't

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.979 
potential last year but we didn't
capitalize<00:02:12.519> on<00:02:12.790> it<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.150> that's<00:02:13.630> what<00:02:13.810> folks

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:13.989 
capitalize on it and that's what folks

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:15.600 
capitalize on it and that's what folks
