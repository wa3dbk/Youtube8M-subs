00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:06.870
 The devil is a video of the opening of the b that was loaded by revival loading but it is very 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.840
 Ne 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:15.130
 It's bad reputation, so how to open that 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.780
 It was said that I thought that I would like to bake something more if I did not expect it 

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.170
 I can not help you 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:24.279
 I think I'll take it one more time Yes 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:28.660
 I'm like that is said Well Kedomo I stool open the bottle without brush sleep a bottle opener 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.830
 Net is something quite tired easily are you using pen by that simple urinary tract is out with a guy 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.860
 It is hard to remove if there is a guy or wife 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.950
 I'm sorry I 'm sorry 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:40.079
 It is a guy that beer Well I mean delicious beer friend 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:42.240
 I know I say also doing this in unlikely to open ocher 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.050
 It seems like I did open it like this 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.800
 It is not an easy thing this time 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.050
 I would like to use a spoon 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.770
 that 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:58.210
 It doesn't open so easily There's also that I'm not so sweet 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.750
 But it is quite difficult, but I think this video will take quite some time 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.940
 But 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.890
 Maa's 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:08.430
 The other way because we will give your best What Regards Well I am thank you 8 easy 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:12.810
 Do it here using the principle of leverage 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.850
 Even though I'm Beku goods shadows in such a feeling it is because I did that go open 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.840
 a 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:22.130
 Well, it's a good condition where you get 3 gold and easy to get bored 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.120
 Yeah Well I wonder I say most 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:30.080
 It is good to open the place just like the lottery 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:33.670
 8 is I used the place hot 9 quite'm hot I as can be seen doing it this way 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.730
 After all I think that I want to use this to make it difficult to open 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.800
 Yes 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:41.860
 I wonder if 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:44.400
 If you say it like this because it's a pretty easy role then that's that 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.380
 I'm looking around 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.380
 Hmmm I guess I'm not 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.070
 eo yeah yeah I 'll go here 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:57.820
 Innovation'll say whether good 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:01.060
 I think it was open and I write fast . 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:01.750
 Um It is also hours that like a before this video 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.220
 What 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:10.300
 Because it does not or came out Hami saying separately that it is is this is quite recommended Well 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:15.010
 Because something similar to this can be easily done without using a spoon 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.750
 If it is suddenly said that there is no bottle opener at the hotel, if it is a normal person 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.710
 I think it is best to borrow at the front desk 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:28.570
 One that I Nde This is also a square nor Toka front here Furnished Apartments 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:28.570
 Thank you very much for your kind introduction
