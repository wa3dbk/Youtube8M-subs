at<00:00:07.919> two<00:00:08.099> devices<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.790> see<00:00:08.970> how<00:00:09.120> they<00:00:09.269> stack<00:00:09.300> up

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
content is in 1080p resolution so you

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.359 
content is in 1080p resolution so you
won't<00:01:30.479> notice<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:30.960> too<00:01:31.229> often<00:01:31.470> but<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.280> the

2 I have to say that I find the droid
dna's<00:01:48.030> design<00:01:48.570> more<00:01:48.869> interesting<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:50.430> droid

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
dna's design more interesting the droid

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.940 
dna's design more interesting the droid
DNA<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.420> also<00:01:51.750> thinner<00:01:52.140> than<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.500> note<00:01:52.680> 2

would<00:01:58.380> seem<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:59.040> two<00:01:59.189> devices<00:01:59.369> are
