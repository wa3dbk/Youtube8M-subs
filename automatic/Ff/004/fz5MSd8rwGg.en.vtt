00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:14.259
 being all friends here sara sara 

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:16.480
 guys right now with you want me 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.699
 say in those three ways and in this 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:21.400
 occasion I have an app for you is the 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.500
 first on my channel and well the other time 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.989
 we were a friend talking to each other 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.430
 facebook is called saul and I was 

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:30.550
 saying hey hey look 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:32.710
 many fashions in the trunk because you do not take 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.680
 one and you comment on it then I got to 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.770
 think and well I think it's a good idea 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.120
 since I've never taken a fad and the 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:43.989
 truth is that I do not consider myself a 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.210
 very, very, very pro player al ahli 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:49.710
 extreme degree but I do not consider myself 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:52.420
 I'm bad so I'm a player 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.970
 that has its good moments both 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.559
 also as bad then in spite of 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.450
 that I 've never taken any moves 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.570
 so that's why I think it 's a great 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.969
 idea part of that in the mode in the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.579
 that he takes out the fashions is not just about 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:08.140
 that he takes it out now but he takes it out and sets it apart 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.630
 the gameplay with which he takes it out is very 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.880
 good 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.680
 so I hope you like this one 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.020
 video you are going to realize that it is 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.579
 a good player and if they would like to see 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.289
 more maps leave it here below in the 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.579
 comments because I would like to know your 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:25.500
 opinion and now yes happening to another topic 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.689
 the month of October I like it a lot but 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.280
 at the same time there is a contrast that I do not 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.229
 like first of all I like it because 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.569
 Well, there are many good releases 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.579
 it's also about december I like 

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.490
 a lot that month also November that's 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.920
 very father but on the other hand in the month 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:44.189
 October my xbox membership ends 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.990
 live then for that reason and also 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.569
 because I set aside several games and for the 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.179
 releases then all that comes together 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.970
 and it's very complicated for me because of that 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.189
 I do not like it that much, but still 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.649
 like my name if I think it wins until 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.299
 end of this month because I think that 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.899
 I still have a challenge to be playing 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.439
 and out there I have some savings that 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.179
 I think if you are going to adjust to buy 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.690
 They give central that is a game that 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.819
 I really want 3 membership and I had 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.220
 paragraph 'medal of honor' but I think that 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.020
 that money was give it to me 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.960
 and I'll have a better time for assassin's 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:23.030
 Believe 3 the truth is that it gives me what was the 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.400
 I liked it a lot but I left it 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.800
 play because there were many champions and in 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.320
 this time I was playing the beta and not 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.260
 I could play it a lot because apparently 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.820
 those who made the campaign of the past 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.670
 they made the multiplayer of this new 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.680
 medal of honor and they did not include 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.320
 buttons that I play with that are led 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.780
 and in color and good and in all 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.080
 games of shooters game with the epp 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.380
 shark layout then this they do not 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.970
 they included and I can not play 100% 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.380
 then this I think I'm not going to 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.660
 buy for this reason 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.430
 unfortunately I had planned to upload 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.620
 gameplay of this game as in some 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.590
 comments have you heard me that 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.600
 I mentioned it but it seems to me that 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:07.880
 well it's going to be aces enrolled by the 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.830
 motive that I just mentioned and 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.630
 good 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.830
 now if going to pre themes that we are 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.110
 just one month after they leave 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.510
 I say not that they leave black 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.330
 ops 2 and I'm very excited about the 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.610
 question of the zombies because I feel 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.190
 that in world at war culture I stayed with 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.870
 a bad impression of the zombies because 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.880
 I remember that some friends of the clan 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.350
 they invited and it was very funny because 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.060
 I was playing with them 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.100
 the point is that I was bored very fast 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.080
 because the important hordes of zombies 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.690
 they always arrived after 10 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.590
 minutes and I as well as have a 20 it 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.600
 comes out as one every two minutes is not a 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.970
 say but you do not understand then 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:50.680
 I was left with that bad impression and 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.470
 that's precisely why I did not play the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.080
 zombies of black ops 1 but now with 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.270
 the videos that I've seen on youtube and 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.980
 apart as lately I was seeing what 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.870
 of the walking dead the series and it's very 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.390
 I think I'm going to give you a 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:06.760
 opportunity because they look pretty 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.280
 good then I think the first thing 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.380
 What am I going to do when I have the game? 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.320
 to be this play the zombies afterwards if 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.209
 maybe play the campaign for a while because 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.830
 I must say that the trailers campaigns 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.500
 I do not like them as much as 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.300
 infinity ward then 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.920
 I think yes I think it's going to 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.680
 be a little campaign after the 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.480
 zombies and then the multiplayer or 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.760
 who knows the truth because right now 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.500
 plans many things at the moment because 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.990
 we are excited and even want the 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.250
 multiplayer then we'll see but if 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.740
 you want to upload a lot of content from 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.200
 black ops 2 on my channel and well so 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:44.110
 be aware of that and moving on to another 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.420
 I also wanted to mention something 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:48.520
 of you and in you know that in others 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.590
 videos had mentioned to them that there was 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:53.200
 applied for partnership adriÃ¡n 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:55.180
 so I do not know why they did not 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.520
 answered already has little more than a month 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.220
 I sent you, I think it does not go beyond 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.380
 two months but the month is already over then 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.790
 what I'm waiting for is that it's more 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.350
 well because they are checking my 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.200
 channel and are preparing a good 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:10.480
 news for me but good I follow the 

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:14.620
 wait and as soon as you have some news 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:17.620
 of this I will let you know and 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.930
 well almost to finish this video 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.699
 I also want to tell you that in the end 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:24.010
 of accounts I decided to set aside the 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:26.560
 edition pro prohibition of black ops 

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:29.020
 2 because I had set the standard but 

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:30.900
 how I was looking at the prices and 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:34.360
 everything I realized was a good 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.580
 offer let's say it so gave it away edition 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.560
 because it comes because the hearing aids and the 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.479
 I play the downloadable content and so on 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.760
 then in the end I decided on that 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.800
 edition and I would like you to tell me 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.260
 you which is which edition is the one 

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.120
 you set aside and here below put what
