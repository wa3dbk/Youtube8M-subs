00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.779
 hello in this video lesson you 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.059
 Meet the knitting technique under 

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:12.760
 the name ukek is a knitting technique 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:15.160
 hook that allows you to knit 

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:17.499
 his canvas and also comment 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.929
 knitting and regular knitting 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:22.319
 hook for the work we need 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:25.390
 special hook here with such here 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:27.849
 such hooks can be bought either 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.130
 special store either do it yourself 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.020
 here's how I drill holes in 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.720
 top of the hook 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.440
 next we stretch into this hole 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.260
 thread 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.780
 the thread should not be fluffy and 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.750
 it is desirable that it is different in color 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.690
 from the thread that we will knit 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:51.160
 the main product stretched the thread and 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:53.880
 let's get to work to start on take 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:58.950
 chain of air loops 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.950
 as usual crochet recruit 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.630
 s367 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.730
 Knit a chain of air loops and 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.070
 further knit as needles for this 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:19.530
 from each air loops we pull out 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.660
 new in this way 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.660
 and leave on the hook 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:46.610
 and the last loop of our series 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.910
 we drove through it we tied the front row 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.950
 face loops 10 loops and now we 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.050
 neatly here and so 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.450
 on the auxiliary . 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.430
 pull as long as we are uncomfortable 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.380
 turn the hook and return his bed 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.140
 so that the auxiliary thread does not pull 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.630
 and did not prevent further knitting further 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.630
 as on the needles we turn the product on 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.869
 seamy side and knit seamy 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.510
 row 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.620
 for this, as usual, the first loop 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:17.570
 remove and then knit the purl loops 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:20.690
 for this thread you so here before 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:25.570
 hook and hook next loop 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:28.670
 pull on the thread in front of the hook 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:30.970
 pull the next loop under the sofa 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.970
 a leg 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.000
 and so knit to the end of our purl 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:43.540
 a row of purl loops 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.540
 in this way 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:04.600
 now attention 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.700
 last loop whatever pattern 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.430
 whatever the front and side 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:13.170
 wrong last loop always 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.940
 fit the face so we recognized 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.430
 have now look draw with 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:22.120
 help another thread from the previous row 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.430
 he is already knitted with us and new loops 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.319
 new row again on 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:29.410
 helper novices and in this way 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.570
 we did it like knitting needles 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.050
 front side we knit facial 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:36.340
 loops turned facial surface on 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.580
 seamy side 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.050
 purl loop rule did we get 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:48.580
 I'll show you how to close the loop for this 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:53.550
 we knit the first loop like this 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:56.940
 that's just and then look crocheted 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:00.000
 We hook the next loop 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.840
 help and flax and thread and knit 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:09.830
 already two loops together again hook 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:14.550
 We hook under auxiliary . you and 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:18.650
 knit two loops together so 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:18.650
 knit the end of our row 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.940
 in this way 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:30.560
 hook the hook under the auxiliary 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.099
 loop and knit two loops in 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.099
 actions 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:10.090
 we have to tie the last 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:10.650
 the loop of our series will fake a hook 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.960
 under 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.539
 auxiliary point and pull out 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.789
 last loop on we can 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:22.539
 pull auxiliary thread to us 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:25.300
 no longer needed and if you have finished knitting 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:29.759
 cut and fix the work thread 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:33.129
 last loop in this way 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:35.979
 fit the product model for technology 

00:05:33.129 --> 00:05:39.509
 looking all the best to you and 

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:39.509
 creative success goodbye
