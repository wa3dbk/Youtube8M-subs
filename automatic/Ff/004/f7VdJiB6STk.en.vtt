hey everyone this is Josh from Josh pcs
in<00:00:03.240> tech<00:00:03.449> and<00:00:03.720> in<00:00:04.200> this<00:00:04.350> video<00:00:04.680> I'm<00:00:04.859> going<00:00:05.160> to

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
in tech and in this video I'm going to

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:06.829 
in tech and in this video I'm going to
show<00:00:05.520> you<00:00:05.549> how<00:00:05.879> you<00:00:05.940> wire<00:00:06.240> your<00:00:06.270> computer

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
show you how you wire your computer

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.280 
show you how you wire your computer
power<00:00:07.080> supply<00:00:07.670> in<00:00:08.670> another<00:00:09.269> video<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.660> made<00:00:09.990> I

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
power supply in another video I made I

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.850 
power supply in another video I made I
think<00:00:10.800> when<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.190> built<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.639> computer<00:00:11.880> I

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860 
think when I built this computer I

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.930 
think when I built this computer I
completely<00:00:13.860> skip<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.460> wiring<00:00:14.670> of<00:00:14.880> the

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
completely skip to the wiring of the

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.349 
completely skip to the wiring of the
power<00:00:15.179> supply<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:15.900> one<00:00:16.710> viewer<00:00:17.180> asked<00:00:18.180> how<00:00:18.300> you

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
power supply so one viewer asked how you

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:18.920 
power supply so one viewer asked how you
do<00:00:18.570> that

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
do that

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.689 
do that
so<00:00:19.109> I'm<00:00:19.350> going<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.619> be<00:00:19.710> making<00:00:20.039> this<00:00:20.220> video<00:00:20.609> to

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
so I'm going to be making this video to

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.920 
so I'm going to be making this video to
show<00:00:20.970> up<00:00:22.189> alright<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.660> starting<00:00:24.660> with<00:00:24.779> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
show up alright so starting with the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.870 
show up alright so starting with the
main<00:00:25.109> things<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:25.650> is<00:00:25.800> your<00:00:25.980> 20<00:00:26.640> pin

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
main things this is your 20 pin

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.759 
main things this is your 20 pin
motherboard<00:00:27.240> connector<00:00:27.570> they<00:00:28.230> also<00:00:28.380> come<00:00:28.680> in

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
motherboard connector they also come in

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.120 
motherboard connector they also come in
24<00:00:29.250> pin<00:00:29.810> usually<00:00:30.810> it's<00:00:30.900> just<00:00:30.929> an<00:00:31.109> additional<00:00:31.830> 4

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
24 pin usually it's just an additional 4

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.860 
24 pin usually it's just an additional 4
pin<00:00:32.340> connector<00:00:32.369> that<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:33.210> can<00:00:33.480> clip<00:00:33.690> onto

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
pin connector that like can clip onto

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.700 
pin connector that like can clip onto
the<00:00:34.079> side<00:00:34.260> of<00:00:34.380> here

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the side of here

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.510 
the side of here
and<00:00:36.260> there's<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.530> connector<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.190> it<00:00:38.340> goes

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
and there's the connector that it goes

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.520 
and there's the connector that it goes
in<00:00:40.100> get<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.180> there's<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.290> little

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
in get this in you just there's a little

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.069 
in get this in you just there's a little
clip<00:00:44.100> right<00:00:44.280> there<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.480> matches<00:00:45.780> up<00:00:45.809> with

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
clip right there and it matches up with

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.380 
clip right there and it matches up with
the<00:00:46.289> kind<00:00:47.039> of<00:00:47.750> lift<00:00:48.750> side<00:00:49.110> right<00:00:49.320> here<00:00:50.390> and

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the kind of lift side right here and

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.270 
the kind of lift side right here and
then<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.719> just<00:00:54.289> plug<00:00:55.289> that<00:00:55.500> sucker<00:00:55.860> straight

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
then you just plug that sucker straight

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.930 
then you just plug that sucker straight
in<00:00:56.399> there<00:01:00.140> now<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:01.770> your<00:01:01.920> 4<00:01:02.160> pin<00:01:02.370> CPU

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
in there now this is your 4 pin CPU

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.420 
in there now this is your 4 pin CPU
power<00:01:03.149> connector<00:01:03.270> this<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.379> because<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
power connector this is just because the

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.280 
power connector this is just because the
motherboard<00:01:05.970> power<00:01:06.210> isn't<00:01:06.600> enough<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.110> power

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
motherboard power isn't enough to power

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.690 
motherboard power isn't enough to power
the<00:01:07.439> CPU<00:01:07.890> so<00:01:08.930> this<00:01:09.930> powers<00:01:10.260> your<00:01:10.380> CPU<00:01:10.830> also

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
the CPU so this powers your CPU also

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.219 
the CPU so this powers your CPU also
there's<00:01:11.880> 8<00:01:12.030> pin<00:01:12.210> connectors<00:01:12.630> for<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:12.990> higher

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
there's 8 pin connectors for the higher

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.990 
there's 8 pin connectors for the higher
wattage<00:01:13.710> CPUs

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.120 

that's<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.750> connector<00:01:22.200> for<00:01:22.410> it<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.770> see<00:01:23.250> it

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.580 

it's<00:01:29.130> in<00:01:29.250> there

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.399 

all<00:01:33.590> right<00:01:34.210> this<00:01:35.210> system<00:01:35.600> doesn't<00:01:35.810> use<00:01:36.050> it<00:01:36.229> but

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
all right this system doesn't use it but

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:39.550 
all right this system doesn't use it but
this<00:01:36.650> is<00:01:36.860> a<00:01:37.040> 4-pin<00:01:37.700> molex<00:01:37.729> connector<00:01:38.600> this<00:01:39.229> was

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
this is a 4-pin molex connector this was

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.990 
this is a 4-pin molex connector this was
pretty<00:01:39.800> much<00:01:39.950> a<00:01:40.010> standard<00:01:40.610> for<00:01:40.880> any

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
pretty much a standard for any

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.410 
pretty much a standard for any
peripherals<00:01:41.720> but<00:01:42.080> now<00:01:42.760> it's<00:01:43.760> not<00:01:44.150> it's<00:01:44.300> a

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
peripherals but now it's not it's a

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.500 
peripherals but now it's not it's a
little<00:01:44.450> bit<00:01:45.080> obsolete<00:01:45.880> this<00:01:46.880> plugs<00:01:47.210> into<00:01:47.390> your

what<00:02:38.959> I<00:02:38.989> wanted<00:02:39.230> to<00:02:39.319> show<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:39.560> was<00:02:39.950> this

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
what I wanted to show you was this

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:45.309 
what I wanted to show you was this
connector<00:02:41.870> right<00:02:42.020> here<00:02:43.000> this<00:02:44.000> is<00:02:44.060> a<00:02:44.510> PCI

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
connector right here this is a PCI

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.920 
connector right here this is a PCI
Express<00:02:46.040> power<00:02:46.640> connector<00:02:47.060> this<00:02:47.270> is<00:02:47.330> for<00:02:47.720> your

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
Express power connector this is for your

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.040 
Express power connector this is for your
graphics<00:02:48.319> cards<00:02:48.650> this<00:02:49.520> particular<00:02:50.209> cable<00:02:50.810> is

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
graphics cards this particular cable is

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.110 
graphics cards this particular cable is
an<00:02:51.170> adapter<00:02:51.650> for<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.010> older<00:02:52.580> power<00:02:52.730> supplies

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
an adapter for the older power supplies

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.880 
an adapter for the older power supplies
that<00:02:53.150> don't<00:02:53.510> have<00:02:53.690> this<00:02:53.900> connector<00:02:54.440> on<00:02:54.590> it

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
that don't have this connector on it

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.309 
that don't have this connector on it
what<00:02:55.580> this<00:02:55.760> would<00:02:55.910> do<00:02:56.030> is<00:02:56.060> just<00:02:56.150> get<00:02:56.870> to<00:02:57.080> those

00:02:57.309 --> 00:02:57.319 
what this would do is just get to those

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:00.520 
what this would do is just get to those
molex<00:02:57.860> four<00:02:58.099> pins<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.780> then<00:02:59.780> convert<00:03:00.200> it<00:03:00.319> into

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
molex four pins and then convert it into

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.259 
molex four pins and then convert it into
something<00:03:00.950> to<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.459> power<00:03:01.670> for<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:01.940> graphics

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
something to the power for the graphics

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.590 
something to the power for the graphics
card<00:03:02.540> because<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:04.069> graphics<00:03:04.489> card<00:03:04.760> is<00:03:05.000> not<00:03:05.360> a

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
card because the graphics card is not a

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.870 
card because the graphics card is not a
lot<00:03:06.290> of<00:03:06.410> all<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.709> higher-end<00:03:07.130> graphics<00:03:07.519> cards

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
lot of all the higher-end graphics cards

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.699 
lot of all the higher-end graphics cards
won't<00:03:08.239> work<00:03:08.450> off<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.870> bus<00:03:09.049> power<00:03:09.319> so<00:03:09.620> they

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
won't work off the bus power so they

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.360 
won't work off the bus power so they
need<00:03:09.860> additional<00:03:10.430> power<00:03:12.069> however<00:03:13.069> all<00:03:13.250> the

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
need additional power however all the

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.039 
need additional power however all the
newer<00:03:13.519> power<00:03:13.819> supplies<00:03:14.180> don't<00:03:14.540> need<00:03:14.840> this

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
newer power supplies don't need this

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.229 
newer power supplies don't need this
because<00:03:15.410> they<00:03:15.560> have<00:03:15.739> this<00:03:15.920> built<00:03:16.190> on<00:03:16.370> but<00:03:16.670> this

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
because they have this built on but this

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.940 
because they have this built on but this
power<00:03:17.540> supply<00:03:17.810> doesn't<00:03:17.870> so<00:03:18.470> if<00:03:18.560> I<00:03:18.650> wanted<00:03:18.890> to

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
power supply doesn't so if I wanted to

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.430 
power supply doesn't so if I wanted to
install<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.670> higher-end<00:03:20.569> graphics<00:03:21.019> card<00:03:21.230> into

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
install a higher-end graphics card into

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.860 
install a higher-end graphics card into
this<00:03:21.560> I<00:03:21.799> would<00:03:21.980> need<00:03:22.160> this<00:03:23.150> kind<00:03:23.360> of<00:03:23.510> cable

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
this I would need this kind of cable

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.070 
this I would need this kind of cable
that<00:03:24.640> wraps<00:03:25.640> it<00:03:25.850> up<00:03:25.940> for<00:03:26.000> computer<00:03:26.840> power

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
that wraps it up for computer power

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.830 
that wraps it up for computer power
