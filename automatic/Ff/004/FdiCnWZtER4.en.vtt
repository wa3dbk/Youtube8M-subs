00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
top here which allows you to mount the

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.010 
top here which allows you to mount the
head<00:01:52.680> so<00:01:53.430> I'm<00:01:53.729> going<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:53.909> put<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.630> head<00:01:54.810> on<00:01:54.840> it

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
head so I'm going to put a head on it

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.859 
head so I'm going to put a head on it
now<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.439> also<00:01:56.100> mount<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.000> camera<00:01:57.270> on<00:01:57.479> here<00:01:57.659> so

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
now and also mount a camera on here so

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.660 
now and also mount a camera on here so
you<00:01:57.930> can<00:01:58.080> see<00:01:58.259> what<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.560> looks<00:01:58.770> like<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.640> I

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you can see what that looks like so I

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.070 
you can see what that looks like so I
bet<00:01:59.850> you<00:01:59.939> didn't<00:02:00.119> expect<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.509> see<00:02:00.750> a<00:02:00.780> camera

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
bet you didn't expect to see a camera

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.450 
bet you didn't expect to see a camera

normally used for using with film but
we've<00:02:10.979> actually<00:02:11.159> converted<00:02:11.879> it<00:02:12.000> if<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.180> just

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
could just as easily convert

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.640
