00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
actually see what both will get a change

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.530 
actually see what both will get a change
the<00:02:18.490> way<00:02:18.580> you<00:02:18.640> play<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:19.000> game<00:02:19.180> because<00:02:19.450> you

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
the way you play the game because you

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.120 
the way you play the game because you
can't<00:02:19.780> really<00:02:19.990> hide<00:02:20.260> between<00:02:20.410> power<00:02:20.830> supply

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.130 
can't really hide between power supply

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.950 
can't really hide between power supply
of<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.550> third<00:02:21.760> because<00:02:22.210> it<00:02:22.360> gets<00:02:22.570> blown<00:02:22.780> away

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
of the third because it gets blown away

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.630 
of the third because it gets blown away
right<00:02:23.140> so<00:02:23.590> your<00:02:24.010> game<00:02:24.160> idea<00:02:24.430> won't<00:02:24.550> work
