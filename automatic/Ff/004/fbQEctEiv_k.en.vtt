really too many mistakes being made on

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:18.150 
really too many mistakes being made on
the<00:03:15.579> field<00:03:15.850> a<00:03:16.350> lot<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.530> things<00:03:17.739> that<00:03:18.010> are<00:03:18.130> just

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
the field a lot of things that are just

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.449 
the field a lot of things that are just
not<00:03:18.430> intelligent<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.680> can't<00:03:21.040> really<00:03:21.190> buy

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
not intelligent so I can't really buy

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.060 
not intelligent so I can't really buy
that<00:03:22.290> you<00:03:23.290> think<00:03:23.560> maybe<00:03:23.739> there's<00:03:23.950> more

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
that you think maybe there's more

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.819 
that you think maybe there's more
mistakes<00:03:25.000> on<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.269> field<00:03:25.540> because<00:03:25.829> there's

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
mistakes on the field because there's

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.180 
mistakes on the field because there's
more<00:03:27.070> teams<00:03:27.430> in<00:03:27.730> the<00:03:27.790> talents<00:03:28.299> running<00:03:28.600> thing
