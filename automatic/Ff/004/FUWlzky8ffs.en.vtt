screen<00:00:50.160> was<00:00:50.460> pretty<00:00:50.789> laggy<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:51.719> had<00:00:51.930> to

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
screen was pretty laggy and I had to

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.830 
screen was pretty laggy and I had to
restore<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.680> game<00:00:52.890> again<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.489> only<00:00:54.090> then<00:00:54.570> I

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
restore the game again and only then I

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.619 
restore the game again and only then I
was<00:00:55.020> able<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.559> join<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:56.010> game<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.670> that's

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
was able to join the game so that's

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.930 
was able to join the game so that's
that's<00:00:58.170> that's<00:00:58.649> really<00:00:58.800> not<00:00:59.129> big<00:00:59.460> of<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.730> deal

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
that's that's really not big of a deal

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.529 
that's that's really not big of a deal

but it was kind of annoying and it made
me<00:01:03.920> kind<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.100> dislike<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.729> developers<00:01:06.390> little

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
impressed but it was this and the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.200 
impressed but it was this and the
gameplay<00:01:21.570> was<00:01:21.600> decent<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:23.180> everything<00:01:24.180> just

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
seemed fine it seemed like a typical

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
seemed fine it seemed like a typical
call<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.119> duty<00:01:27.360> game<00:01:27.829> which<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:28.860> just<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.850> decent

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
call of duty game which is just a decent

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.780

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.310 
I mean it's definitely better than model
for<00:01:33.000> three<00:01:33.240> definitely<00:01:33.750> better<00:01:33.960> than<00:01:34.020> black

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
for three definitely better than black

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.859 
for three definitely better than black

good<00:02:21.660> no<00:02:22.380> doubt<00:02:22.620> about<00:02:22.770> that<00:02:23.130> but<00:02:23.400> sometimes

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
good no doubt about that but sometimes

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.530

FPS<00:02:27.810> I<00:02:28.380> mean<00:02:29.010> that's<00:02:29.640> if<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.510> think<00:02:30.750> about<00:02:30.840> it

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
FPS I mean that's if you think about it

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.809 
FPS I mean that's if you think about it
like<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:31.470> it's<00:02:31.739> not<00:02:31.920> actually<00:02:32.280> that<00:02:32.310> big<00:02:32.670> of

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
like that it's not actually that big of

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.720 
like that it's not actually that big of
a<00:02:32.910> deal<00:02:33.120> but<00:02:33.959> if<00:02:34.560> you're<00:02:34.920> in<00:02:35.130> the<00:02:35.220> middle<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.580> a

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
a deal but if you're in the middle of a

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.790 
a deal but if you're in the middle of a
gunfight<00:02:36.300> then<00:02:36.569> it<00:02:36.750> might<00:02:36.959> actually<00:02:37.170> fuck<00:02:37.650> it

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
gunfight then it might actually fuck it

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.530 
gunfight then it might actually fuck it
up<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.250> you<00:02:38.370> might<00:02:38.580> lose<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.910> gunfight<00:02:39.360> and

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
up and you might lose the gunfight and

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.449 
up and you might lose the gunfight and
you<00:02:39.690> might<00:02:39.900> rage<00:02:40.170> so<00:02:40.920> that's<00:02:41.190> just<00:02:41.280> something

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
you might rage so that's just something

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.030 
you might rage so that's just something
to<00:02:41.970> think<00:02:42.000> about<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.750> mean<00:02:43.080> that<00:02:43.410> really<00:02:43.620> pissed

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
to think about I mean that really pissed

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.360 
to think about I mean that really pissed
me<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> fuck<00:02:44.400> off<00:02:44.819> and<00:02:45.120> I<00:02:45.750> you<00:02:46.739> guys<00:02:46.920> might<00:02:47.190> not

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
me the fuck off and I you guys might not

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.809 
me the fuck off and I you guys might not
actually<00:02:47.640> understand<00:02:48.299> this<00:02:48.540> but<00:02:49.580> I've<00:02:50.580> been

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
actually understand this but I've been

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.670 
actually understand this but I've been
gaming<00:02:51.120> for<00:02:51.330> quite<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> while<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.260> I<00:02:52.650> just

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
gaming for quite a while and I just

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.910 
gaming for quite a while and I just
can't<00:02:53.190> stand<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.970> lag<00:02:54.390> I<00:02:54.780> mean<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.410> game<00:02:55.709> is

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
can't stand the lag I mean this game is

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.309 
can't stand the lag I mean this game is
finished<00:02:56.190> it's<00:02:56.549> unlike<00:02:56.970> that<00:02:57.480> battlefield<00:02:57.900> 4

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
finished it's unlike that battlefield 4

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.860 
finished it's unlike that battlefield 4
way<00:02:58.500> it<00:02:58.560> was<00:02:58.799> in<00:02:58.950> beta<00:02:59.160> I<00:02:59.549> understand<00:03:00.299> that

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
way it was in beta I understand that

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.509 
way it was in beta I understand that
when<00:03:01.170> the<00:03:01.290> game<00:03:01.470> is<00:03:01.620> in<00:03:01.769> beta<00:03:01.950> then<00:03:02.220> you<00:03:02.340> need

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
when the game is in beta then you need

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.000 
when the game is in beta then you need
to<00:03:02.610> fix<00:03:02.849> it<00:03:03.090> and<00:03:03.180> that<00:03:04.110> would<00:03:04.290> battlefield<00:03:04.769> 4

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
to fix it and that would battlefield 4

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.850 
to fix it and that would battlefield 4
did<00:03:05.190> in<00:03:05.340> my<00:03:05.489> opinion<00:03:05.819> but<00:03:06.180> call<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.630> duty<00:03:06.930> man

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
did in my opinion but call of duty man

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.240 
did in my opinion but call of duty man
it<00:03:08.400> drops<00:03:09.299> frames<00:03:09.750> on<00:03:10.049> pc<00:03:10.500> version<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.099> it

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
it drops frames on pc version and it

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.000 
it drops frames on pc version and it
makes<00:03:11.489> me<00:03:11.610> think<00:03:12.090> that<00:03:12.500> developers<00:03:13.500> just<00:03:13.769> sort

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
makes me think that developers just sort

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.949 
makes me think that developers just sort
of<00:03:14.069> don't<00:03:14.370> care<00:03:14.640> for<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.030> pc<00:03:15.420> that<00:03:15.630> didn't

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
of don't care for the pc that didn't

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.550 
of don't care for the pc that didn't
optimize<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.620> game<00:03:16.830> properly<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:18.019> it<00:03:19.019> has<00:03:19.380> a

optimize the game properly and it has a

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.430 
optimize the game properly and it has a
pretty<00:03:20.040> poor<00:03:20.400> pc<00:03:20.940> optimization<00:03:21.870> at<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.290> end

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
pretty poor pc optimization at the end

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.590 
pretty poor pc optimization at the end
of<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.680> day<00:03:22.890> in<00:03:23.160> addition<00:03:23.549> to<00:03:23.940> all<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.239> this
