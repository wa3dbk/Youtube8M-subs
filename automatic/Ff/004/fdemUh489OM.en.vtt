00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:11.090
 and there is an even more exciting plan ahead 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.650
 Apollo flights have already been announced 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.360
 numbered 18 19 20 everything is ready people 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:22.040
 rocket technology 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:25.270
 landing sites are announced and suddenly our 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.170
 announces the termination of further flight 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:31.930
 from making it was a bolt from the blue 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.230
 perplexed everyone somehow really 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.750
 interesting place 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.200
 strange solution explained excessive 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.879
 high cost of the project money of course 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:48.090
 huge tens of billions of dollars but 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.580
 because the bulk of them have already been spent and 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:56.699
 still have 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:01:00.150
 Polygon rocket laboratory astronauts 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.019
 trained left to send to the moon three 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.500
 ship and it is mere crumbs and each 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.160
 each flight is worth no more than the price of one 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:14.600
 bomber and suddenly when it came 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.300
 time gets the main dividend all 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.970
 stops be maybe doing here 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.670
 not only in money for the moon project 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.590
 was allocated at the time ninety 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.210
 nine billion dollars seems here 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.899
 don't remember and 178 it doesn't matter so much 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.550
 will complete a couple of billion that's when already 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.160
 have invested that amount there are almost 100 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.130
 billions invested suddenly decided that this 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.200
 not profitable and curtailed the program but also 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.539
 understand would have invested two billion 100 and 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.030
 decided to ship elementary turned but 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.479
 when attachment 98 is already 2 stay there 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.929
 not the 3rd stage put in this blood and 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.369
 follow for complete and then already 

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:57.890
 suddenly not there and when already sat on 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.390
 surface when discovered there 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.830
 spaceships others and so on 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.239
 so on when came in contact with 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.069
 other civilizations seemingly 

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:10.289
 why turn off why turned 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.840
 why our research turned with 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:16.260
 using lunar rovers a coward and because 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.810
 the communard you need at the top of the text you 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:23.069
 confronted there said do not meddle 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.120
 and they also do not move why because 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:30.510
 said the hosts 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:31.730
 Turn around March 21, 1996 scientists and 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.519
 nasa engineers 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.860
 you publishes a statement there are serious 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:39.159
 reason to believe that the moon has 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.900
 foreign artificial structures and objects 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.489
 to the question why this information is not 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.849
 brought to the public earlier 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.860
 NASA experts responded 20 years ago 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.989
 it was difficult to predict how to react 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.010
 people on the message that the moon 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.500
 someone was 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:58.959
 or is there in our time besides that there were 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.959
 other reasons not related to us 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.970
 do not think that after the statement 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.370
 scientists with secrecy was done about 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.370
 Something think that the whole truth Omsk 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:15.190
 understand the truth of it is proven and 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:17.050
 profitable partly not so long ago 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.970
 designer's statement is known 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.460
 american missiles werner von brown 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.640
 which he did shortly after stopping 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.820
 lunar program on the moon there are extraterrestrial 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.540
 forces that are much more powerful than we can 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.390
 to suggest 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:36.460
 but I have no right to talk about 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:39.040
 Apollo 11 Nile Commander details 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.190
 Armstrong in one of the private conversations allegedly 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.980
 I can not add details I will say 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.580
 just their ships are significant 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.000
 superior to ours 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.140
 and the size and technology have made us understand 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.350
 what place is taken 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:58.600
 after this 20 years we were silent about the flights 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:04:00.570
 to the moon to us people who fell on 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.350
 the moon its fragile apparatuses 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:07.890
 resisted unknown mighty 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.890
 reasonable force
