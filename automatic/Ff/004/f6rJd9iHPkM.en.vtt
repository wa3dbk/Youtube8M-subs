00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
extension it looks something like this

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.049 
extension it looks something like this
with<00:00:54.679> the<00:00:54.800> 13<00:00:55.190> millimeter<00:00:55.340> at<00:00:56.300> the<00:00:56.510> end<00:00:56.660> of<00:00:56.809> it

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 
okay so I went ahead remove the pump

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.590 
okay so I went ahead remove the pump
here<00:01:02.000> again<00:01:02.809> there<00:01:02.960> were<00:01:03.050> 1<00:01:03.739> 1<00:01:04.250> here<00:01:04.490> 13<00:01:05.000> and

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110 
towards towards the block of the engine

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.650 
towards towards the block of the engine
in<00:01:12.620> order<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.580> access<00:01:13.820> this<00:01:14.180> you<00:01:14.450> need<00:01:14.540> an

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
in order to access this you need an

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.830 
in order to access this you need an
extension<00:01:15.130> okay<00:01:16.130> of<00:01:16.580> course<00:01:16.640> you're<00:01:17.630> going<00:01:17.750> to

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
extension okay of course you're going to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.990 
extension okay of course you're going to
have<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:18.020> go<00:01:18.200> ahead<00:01:18.410> and<00:01:18.590> remove<00:01:19.160> two<00:01:19.190> hoses

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:20.000

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
another one here I just found it easier

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.440 
another one here I just found it easier
to<00:01:26.780> remove<00:01:27.080> it<00:01:27.230> up<00:01:27.800> here<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.640> this<00:01:29.120> connects

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
to remove it up here and this connects

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.990 
to remove it up here and this connects
to<00:01:29.660> the<00:01:29.780> power<00:01:30.140> steering<00:01:30.560> reservoir<00:01:30.680> it<00:01:31.220> you

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
to the power steering reservoir it you

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.090 
to the power steering reservoir it you
know<00:01:32.090> gives<00:01:32.300> you<00:01:32.360> better<00:01:32.540> access<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.320> I<00:01:33.950> was

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
know gives you better access and I was

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.460 
know gives you better access and I was
able<00:01:34.310> to<00:01:34.340> slide<00:01:34.580> it<00:01:34.700> off<00:01:34.850> faster<00:01:35.600> again<00:01:36.140> it's

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
able to slide it off faster again it's

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.630 
able to slide it off faster again it's
up<00:01:36.620> to<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:36.830> you<00:01:36.890> can<00:01:37.070> go<00:01:37.190> ahead<00:01:37.250> and<00:01:37.400> do<00:01:37.490> it

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
up to you you can go ahead and do it

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.700 
up to you you can go ahead and do it
from<00:01:37.790> here<00:01:37.940> as<00:01:38.060> well<00:01:38.240> and<00:01:38.480> I<00:01:39.200> believe<00:01:39.230> this

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
from here as well and I believe this

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.290 
from here as well and I believe this
bolt<00:01:40.100> is<00:01:40.370> a<00:01:40.990> 18<00:01:41.990> when<00:01:42.410> I'm<00:01:42.530> mistaken<00:01:42.770> but

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
bolt is a 18 when I'm mistaken but

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.240 
bolt is a 18 when I'm mistaken but
anyhow<00:01:44.300> so<00:01:44.540> you<00:01:45.500> got<00:01:45.620> to<00:01:45.680> remove<00:01:45.890> two<00:01:46.040> hoses

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
anyhow so you got to remove two hoses

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.490 
anyhow so you got to remove two hoses
and<00:01:46.640> three<00:01:47.270> bolts<00:01:47.630> and<00:01:47.780> that's<00:01:48.290> what<00:01:48.440> the

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
and three bolts and that's what the

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.620 
and three bolts and that's what the
power<00:01:48.680> steering<00:01:48.950> pump<00:01:49.100> comes<00:01:49.490> off<00:01:49.670> and<00:01:49.940> just

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
power steering pump comes off and just

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.230 
power steering pump comes off and just
make<00:01:50.780> sure<00:01:50.810> you<00:01:51.020> have<00:01:51.200> a<00:01:51.910> something<00:01:52.910> to<00:01:53.090> hold

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
make sure you have a something to hold

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.730 
make sure you have a something to hold
the<00:01:53.360> power<00:01:53.540> steering<00:01:53.840> because<00:01:54.470> otherwise

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
the power steering because otherwise

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.230 
the power steering because otherwise
you're<00:01:55.010> going<00:01:55.040> to<00:01:55.280> create<00:01:55.790> a<00:01:55.880> mess<00:01:56.060> on<00:01:56.210> the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
you're going to create a mess on the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.530 
you're going to create a mess on the
floor

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:56.540 
floor

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.930
