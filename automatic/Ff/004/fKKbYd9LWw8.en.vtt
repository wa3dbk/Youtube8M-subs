I<00:00:46.110> know<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:47.010> lot<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.460> people<00:00:47.730> probably

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
I know a lot of people probably

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
I know a lot of people probably
understand<00:00:48.960> the<00:00:49.050> basic<00:00:49.379> information<00:00:49.590> there

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
understand the basic information there

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.799 
understand the basic information there
but<00:00:50.160> really<00:00:50.610> don't<00:00:50.789> understand<00:00:51.210> how<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.420> farm

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
but really don't understand how to farm

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:54.020 
but really don't understand how to farm
to<00:00:52.020> fight<00:00:52.199> these<00:00:52.350> guys<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.789> way<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
to fight these guys and the way the

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.090 
to fight these guys and the way the
death<00:00:54.180> marks<00:00:54.449> work<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.530> more<00:00:55.739> people<00:00:56.039> in

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
death marks work is the more people in

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.529 
death marks work is the more people in
your<00:00:56.129> party<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.789> a<00:00:56.820> death<00:00:57.030> mark<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
your party that have a death mark the

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.029 
your party that have a death mark the
higher<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.989> chance<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.440> get<00:00:58.530> them<00:00:58.680> to<00:00:58.800> spawn

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
higher the chance to get them to spawn

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.650 
higher the chance to get them to spawn
that's<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> most<00:00:59.550> basic<00:00:59.760> way<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.120> can<00:01:00.359> put<00:01:00.539> it

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
that's the most basic way I can put it

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.170 
that's the most basic way I can put it
is<00:01:01.160> you<00:01:02.160> just<00:01:02.460> want<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> have<00:01:02.820> as<00:01:02.940> many<00:01:03.059> people

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
is you just want to have as many people

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.600 
is you just want to have as many people
in<00:01:03.449> your<00:01:03.539> party<00:01:03.600> with<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.619> death<00:01:05.070> mark<00:01:05.369> for<00:01:05.549> the

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
in your party with a death mark for the

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.380 
in your party with a death mark for the
goose<00:01:05.790> tag<00:01:05.970> 3<00:01:06.270> as<00:01:06.450> possible<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:08.030> with<00:01:09.030> 4<00:01:09.240> people

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
goose tag 3 as possible so with 4 people

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.370 
goose tag 3 as possible so with 4 people
that's<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> highest<00:01:09.960> chance<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.320> get

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
that's the highest chance you can get

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.600 
that's the highest chance you can get
playing<00:01:10.619> by<00:01:10.740> yourself<00:01:10.860> that's<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.430> lowest

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
playing by yourself that's the lowest

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.730 
playing by yourself that's the lowest
chance<00:01:11.909> you<00:01:12.090> can<00:01:12.240> get<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.810> say<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> best<00:01:13.560> way<00:01:13.710> to

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
chance you can get I say the best way to

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.469 
chance you can get I say the best way to
find<00:01:13.979> people<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.340> have<00:01:14.670> these<00:01:14.880> death<00:01:15.119> marks

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
find people that have these death marks

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.749 
find people that have these death marks

health and that is whenever an alert
comes<00:01:46.380> up<00:01:46.649> just<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.759> do<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.180> 5<00:01:48.930> runs<00:01:49.259> on

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
going for these missions I'm sure a lot

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.430 
going for these missions I'm sure a lot
of<00:02:45.060> people<00:02:45.300> are<00:02:45.390> running<00:02:45.540> necrose<00:02:46.049> in<00:02:46.290> the

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
of people are running necrose in the

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.199 
of people are running necrose in the
invasion<00:02:47.220> missions<00:02:47.459> right<00:02:47.610> now<00:02:47.730> just<00:02:48.030> for

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
invasion missions right now just for

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.410 
invasion missions right now just for
this<00:02:48.330> cause<00:02:49.140> right<00:02:49.560> now<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:50.180> that's<00:02:51.180> pretty

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
this cause right now so that's pretty

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.850 
this cause right now so that's pretty
much<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.720> only<00:02:51.750> ways<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.200> can<00:02:52.319> farm<00:02:52.530> for<00:02:52.769> it

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
much the only ways you can farm for it

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.530 
much the only ways you can farm for it
do<00:02:53.010> note<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.250> if<00:02:53.489> you<00:02:53.580> fight<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:53.910> goo<00:02:54.060> stag<00:02:54.299> 3

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
do note that if you fight the goo stag 3

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.330 
do note that if you fight the goo stag 3
and<00:02:54.690> they<00:02:54.780> defeat<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.590> will<00:02:55.739> get<00:02:55.860> a<00:02:55.920> bolt

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
and they defeat you you will get a bolt

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.280 
and they defeat you you will get a bolt
attached<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.970> your<00:02:57.060> Tenno<00:02:57.360> as<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:57.989> can<00:02:58.140> see

here here's an email from Lotus telling
you<00:03:00.690> about<00:03:00.840> the<00:03:01.140> bolt<00:03:01.349> that<00:03:01.470> has<00:03:01.590> been

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
you about the bolt that has been

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.780 
you about the bolt that has been
attached<00:03:02.040> and<00:03:02.280> she<00:03:02.430> will<00:03:02.549> give<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.760> a

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
attached and she will give you a

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.210 
attached and she will give you a
blueprint<00:03:03.390> which<00:03:03.930> you<00:03:04.080> can<00:03:04.230> use<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:04.500> make<00:03:04.950> a

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
blueprint which you can use to make a

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.100 
blueprint which you can use to make a
remover<00:03:06.120> which<00:03:06.269> will<00:03:06.420> remove<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.810> from<00:03:06.840> you

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
remover which will remove it from you

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.449 
remover which will remove it from you
and<00:03:07.200> what<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.530> bolt<00:03:07.739> does<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.099> makes<00:03:08.310> you

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
and what that bolt does is makes you

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.850 
and what that bolt does is makes you
weaker<00:03:08.880> against<00:03:09.239> grenier<00:03:09.709> basically<00:03:10.709> I<00:03:10.739> think

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
weaker against grenier basically I think

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.000 
weaker against grenier basically I think
what<00:03:11.310> it<00:03:11.430> does<00:03:11.580> is<00:03:11.849> makes<00:03:12.180> your<00:03:12.299> powers<00:03:13.010> do

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
what it does is makes your powers do

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.650 
what it does is makes your powers do
nothing<00:03:14.370> or<00:03:14.549> you<00:03:14.670> can't<00:03:14.910> activate<00:03:15.209> powers

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
nothing or you can't activate powers

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.910 
nothing or you can't activate powers
when<00:03:15.810> fighting<00:03:16.080> against<00:03:16.349> grenier<00:03:16.620> or<00:03:16.830> the

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
when fighting against grenier or the
