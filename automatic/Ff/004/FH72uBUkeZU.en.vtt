00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:07.060
 Hello my name is Evgeny Nikiforov 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.980
 lower pore restaurateur this video is for those 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.050
 chefs who have recently become 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.650
 sous-chef you and now face 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:17.650
 such difficulties in guiding the kitchen 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.740
 as the need for constant monitoring 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.570
 colleagues because this or that 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.330
 the cook tries to do something 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.939
 wrong and most often it happens not because 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.830
 that guys sabotage yes and such too 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.720
 It happens about this I will tell in the following 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.410
 video and there are that mouse man 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.430
 scattered 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.510
 Yes, and you always have to 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.739
 control the return of food 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.760
 control so the guys abide 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.850
 process technology 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.790
 so here to get rid of 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.559
 the constant need for this control 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.329
 make a little of your hands and your 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.950
 consciousness to engage others 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.500
 there are some more important things 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.680
 for example, there is an order of products and fills 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.719
 and same journals on or there elaboration 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.480
 some new dishes and and there closing 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:06.189
 some weaker kitchen data points 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:09.299
 what should be done needs to be calculated 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:13.060
 specifically what are the moments of these chefs 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:17.200
 let's say this cooks have weak 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.619
 hand yes well for example he commit there 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:24.099
 mistakes while cooking steak 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.409
 you need means to publicly state how 

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:29.170
 would by chance during the works or maybe during 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.539
 talk time that's this ax here 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.579
 He then generally excellent stand to do 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.549
 without mentioning that they 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.109
 Often there are pigtails 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:41.819
 publicly state what exactly this 

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:49.179
 the man is doing this operation 

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:51.069
 fine i assure you after you 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:55.060
 publicly with all declare and he himself 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:57.849
 hear and when he will come out such 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.789
 dishes with which he mows it in no way 

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:03.009
 case will not allow itself carelessly 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.039
 treat this recipe to this dish 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:10.179
 and will be sure to give them as 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.830
 because now the whole restaurant or 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.470
 there may be a majority there 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:18.520
 the team is aware that he is doing it 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:21.400
 well if he do it bad too 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.230
 not easy you will be unhappy until what 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.780
 it may not be so scary for him 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.600
 but when everyone looks at him and 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:34.360
 say bryn listen man but you 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.440
 this is not expected yes that is the team 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:42.430
 this is a big family and none of us 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:45.870
 want in this family look like something 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:49.660
 ugly yes if the person does not justify 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.010
 general opinion of him yes then naturally 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.350
 he will not be very comfortable in 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.580
 collective and any normal person 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.440
 try to avoid 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.760
 yes of course there are exceptions to people 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.340
 absolutely uncontrollable 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.840
 and driven by completely different motives 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.160
 yes someone can someone can not 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.800
 like that you became sous-chef 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.810
 special kosyachat sabotages but here 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.160
 experiencing you this also happens but on 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.840
 this is the other recipe we are talking about now 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.190
 just about that person a little 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.610
 scattered carelessly so little 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.459
 refers to the process yes that is but 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.500
 allow yourself to forget something that is 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.580
 so for each of each operation you 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.350
 can neatly on publicly during 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.750
 some talk to declare that 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.400
 here it is now 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.340
 good he has this one right here 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.830
 Great it turns out this port in this on 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.530
 you do it wonderful 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.140
 a team of people who are really friend before 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.000
 friend will keep a brand of his name 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:49.450
 that they have already been called such experts 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.470
 so this is a social principle 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.660
 evidence mixed with social 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.470
 obligations that is, you are social 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:04:01.120
 prove to people that their opinion that you 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.000
 think about this means there is such and 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.920
 he will automatically try 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.630
 confirm it about him 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.549
 absolutely normal that is psychology 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:15.190
 it works so i recommend 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:16.840
 apply and your job sous-chef will 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.729
 much easier and more enjoyable and 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.539
 more interesting because the work should 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.190
 bring pleasure and not thought about 

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:24.860
 that as we are staring when it is soon 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.200
 law 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:31.440
 so develop apply these 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.190
 techniques i wish them success become
