 large north cooperatives 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.250
 why the producers 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.230
 from it also really the extraction and processing parked 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.030
 of the environment in this installation 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:38.740
 this machine that allows you to breathe that in the extractor machine of him in the 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.840

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.570
 do not even copy equipment 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.570
 the difference we make 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.740
 either 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.460

 be able to have our honey exported directly euro 

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:17.469
 if the quique project 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.619
 that not only of themselves but we have to demand that this year they are going 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:26.009
 to achieve if not also in total the fractionated reach out but hopefully 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:29.029
 supermarket gondola in the north and is decisive
