00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.450 
people on YouTube like they got this
here<00:00:19.260> I<00:00:19.289> know<00:00:19.470> it's<00:00:19.590> like<00:00:19.710> an<00:00:19.830> array<00:00:20.070> in<00:00:20.250> black

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460

like<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> black<00:00:21.090> and<00:00:21.330> gold<00:00:21.660> packaging<00:00:22.590> but<00:00:23.369> I

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
like a black and gold packaging but I

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.609

long<00:02:14.450> but<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:16.190> it'll<00:02:17.190> probably<00:02:17.370> get<00:02:17.610> shorter

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
long but on it'll probably get shorter

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.660 
and also when I activate the curls
shorter<00:02:23.900> so<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.380> is<00:02:25.530> actually<00:02:26.010> my<00:02:26.160> first<00:02:26.400> so
