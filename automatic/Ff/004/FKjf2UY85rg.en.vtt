00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.890
 the intro pathose pity that the 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.990
 story of rattle worlds cross afterwards 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.609
 but rather like that, it ripples 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.609
 is also due to the poor presentation 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.190
 again the future 3ds tear us 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.309
 sequences between the missions 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.440
 her wooden figures from the stool, too 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.629
 the text dialogues in the inserts themselves 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.040
 would be in a conversation window 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.340
 do not hide a tip now and then 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 we would just skip it 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.559
 but we already have that 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.480
 pretty much the only bigger one 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.039
 Negotiated by bet awards and black 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.660
 can devote ourselves to what is in one 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.969
 round strategy player most counts 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.170
 namely the fighting system that builds in 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.760
 many points to the good old 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.079
 begging run miracle knows now as well 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.680
 easy to learn but hard to handle 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.719
 master 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.070
 Although we control in a few 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.720
 have minutes and she is too 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.460
 no big numbers of troops or 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.140
 Command gives the game system 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.320
 yet a tremendous tactical depth 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.850
 leaves room for tricks and tricks lies 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.500
 essentially two units 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.240
 on the one hand, the impact force increases 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.939
 our units the more of them we 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.930
 next to an opposing troop 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.100
 That's why we always try ours 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.970
 massaging forces and simplistic 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.500
 fight back 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.900
 also because the attacked 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.040
 usually can fight only once 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.509
 but in return also on it 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.110
 Do not pay our protÃ©gÃ©s anywhere 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.110
 to expose 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.730
 on the other hand, our units can pro 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.700
 perform two actions which 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:48.260
 That depends on the troops some can 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.120
 drive once and once fire and yourself 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.650
 then, for example, withdraw again 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.570
 others can do it twice 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.430
 pull in a row and so about opponents 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.410
 others are falling in the back 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.570
 must attack twice so 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:03.160
 each one was down through planning especially the 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.160
 computer opponent plays really clever 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.869
 technically there is little since kans 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:10.850
 exposing 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.500
 Of course it is not a graphic miracle 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.270
 for the traditionally rather homebaked 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.520
 round genre really nice to look at 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.110
 we demonstrate this briefly in which we 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.970
 to trigger a chip mode and sometimes from 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.970
 the overview card to very close to the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.050
 units run son only occasionally 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.010
 we have a certain amount 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.750
 raw materials come and are allowed 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.940
 For example, in factories on fresh 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.800
 Replenishment produce such construction 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.060
 Aspects remain but always incidental 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.930
 look at what is focused on 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.400
 warfare differ brickell 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.470
 essentially different from each other and bring 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.209
 on special skills with these robots 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.920
 for example, you can put the 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.709
 careless armor lightning fast 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.970
 Negotiate metal 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.560
 this workshop truck in turn 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.660
 can for ailing allies 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.370
 repair them while consuming their own 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.549
 resources and that are near 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.200
 all levels are severely limited 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.790
 Incidentally, there are also land units 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.160
 an air force with helicopters 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.230
 jumbo planes are bombing as well 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.850
 a handful of ships big lake or 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.850
 However, battles did not happen 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.660
 the two campaigns are coming along 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.790
 their 13 missions initially little 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.650
 extensive the once mission are there 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.180
 firstly varied and secondly 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.280
 sometimes several hours so battle 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.379
 girls on a play time from 30 to 40 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.030
 there are still hours to come 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:32.310
 some even from receivables as well as one 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:33.989
 solid multiplayer free 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:36.030
 replenishment is also already announced 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:36.930
 partly from the community and partly from 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.879
 the developers themselves 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.470
 We are definitely looking forward to it 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.879
 The battles of 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.620
 as huttons despite some smaller ones 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.090
 weaken such as the one in question 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.860
 resource management or sometimes 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.250
 a little slow play a lot of joy 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.250
 prepares
