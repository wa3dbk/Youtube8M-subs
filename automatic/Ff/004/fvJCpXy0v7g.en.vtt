 here you put that in your dish 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:47.940
 well basically like this and you go 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.430
 put a small trickle of oil in the bottom of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.360
 dish and above all especially help you to 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.289
 forget to season slightly here 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.550
 just the flower of salt 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.620
 it's perfect then here I have a very 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.809
 nice piece of hake see a little bit 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.570
 thick and we will adjust the time of 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.610
 cooking in relation to the shape to the 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.140
 size to the thickness of the piece on this 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.880
 piece I want to cook them 25 minutes to 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.650
 oven okay and if I had it in 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.630
 of weapons game the priest 7 to 8 minutes 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.100
 would be more than enough then you 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.390
 see if my piece is a 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.070
 piece of rather basic and in the 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.479
 hake tail there is a piece that is 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.159
 thinner and thicker 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.540
 during the thicker piece bardet the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.930
 along the central ridge I'm going to do 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.360
 two years cut like that they're going 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.549
 help cooking that will speed up a 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.829
 little cooking on the thicker side and 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.299
 games for example i'm going to m de 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.180
 small branches of rosemary for 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:41.250
 perfume with the little hakes we could 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.899
 also put small ones small 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.090
 fresh herbs and spices and its 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.369
 games at the bottom did not look at her and I 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.030
 put garlic cloves in a shirt to 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.240
 do not burn it 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.310
 and I'm going to season my hake by the 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.549
 jv saddle a little bit generous and I 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.799
 go room and on all sides and there 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:06.780
 including all sides of hake here 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.550
 I gently put my hake on my 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.610
 vegetable bed 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.500
 I spray olive oil 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.730
 and I will not put pepper 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.290
 mill because the mill pepper is going 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.210
 to be animated at cooking I would put it 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:21.180
 the oven exit I preheated my 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.800
 oven at 190 degrees and I'm going to cook 25 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.860
 minutes for a piece of this size 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.630
 there right now that's the fish fate 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.710
 of the oven 1 25 minutes of cooking is this 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.510
 that it must be understood is that 

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:31.770
 when he comes out of the oven and continue to 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.930
 to cook so it's better a fish a 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.240
 a little bit undercooked on screaming 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.920
 okay so first test with you 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.270
 take a small wooden spade and you 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.440
 go sting and especially in the parties 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.720
 the thickest because the tail 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.460
 she is necessarily well cooked ward 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.380
 and now it sinks easily 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:48.270
 that is already a first sign of 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.890
 cooking and especially especially when 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.350
 you are going to adjust the cooking time 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.700
 compared to hoarau to the thickness of 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.150
 your piece you will check by 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.500
 allards is here and here yes it takes 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.160
 that it comes off but you support 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.320
 still a little bit 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.460
 here we have something 38 side that 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.680
 is signed perfect cooking 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.210
 that's the cooking is over and I 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.070
 that I like in the fish cooking at 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.450
 oven is that I pose are placed on 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.340
 table there is more than to share it in 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.570
 family or friends 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.230
 and it's happiness it's simple then 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.230
 now it's up to you
