00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.790 
been doing that for a long time and from
the<00:00:28.850> moment<00:00:28.880> i<00:00:29.270> agreed<00:00:29.720> to<00:00:29.750> to<00:00:30.350> start<00:00:30.560> working

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
the moment i agreed to to start working

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.040 
the moment i agreed to to start working
with<00:00:30.890> AMC<00:00:31.280> that<00:00:31.850> i<00:00:31.880> let<00:00:32.180> them<00:00:32.210> know<00:00:32.390> my<00:00:32.570> goal

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 
with AMC that i let them know my goal

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.150 
with AMC that i let them know my goal
was<00:00:33.200> to<00:00:33.350> get<00:00:33.440> a<00:00:33.500> show<00:00:33.710> going<00:00:33.890> and<00:00:34.370> so<00:00:34.579> but<00:00:35.090> AMC

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
was to get a show going and so but AMC

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.010 
was to get a show going and so but AMC
was<00:00:37.160> understandably<00:00:38.150> a<00:00:38.239> little<00:00:38.300> hesitant<00:00:38.870> to

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
was understandably a little hesitant to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.610 
was understandably a little hesitant to
let<00:00:39.410> us<00:00:39.680> speak<00:00:40.130> with<00:00:40.340> an<00:00:40.460> editorial<00:00:40.579> voice<00:00:41.620> and

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
let us speak with an editorial voice and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.650 
let us speak with an editorial voice and
so<00:00:43.040> it<00:00:43.310> took<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.520> few<00:00:43.760> years<00:00:43.820> for<00:00:44.239> them<00:00:44.329> to<00:00:44.390> warm

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 
so it took a few years for them to warm

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.630 
so it took a few years for them to warm
up<00:00:44.780> to<00:00:44.870> the<00:00:44.960> idea<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.410> then<00:00:45.560> our<00:00:45.800> social<00:00:46.399> media
