there<00:01:38.759> if<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:38.850> wanted<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.810> let's<00:01:39.990> face<00:01:40.140> it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
there if you wanted to but let's face it

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.469 
there if you wanted to but let's face it
you're<00:01:40.650> not<00:01:40.770> gonna<00:01:40.950> be<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> selfish<00:01:42.210> bastard

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
you're not gonna be a selfish bastard

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.030 
you're not gonna be a selfish bastard
and<00:01:42.899> then<00:01:43.020> there<00:01:43.170> are<00:01:43.290> portals<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.829> world

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
and then there are portals to the world

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.980 
and then there are portals to the world
they<00:01:44.369> are<00:01:44.399> arranged<00:01:44.939> in<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.180> Tower<00:01:45.390> by<00:01:45.630> level

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
they are arranged in this Tower by level

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.210 
they are arranged in this Tower by level
so<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> higher<00:01:46.350> level<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.619> get<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.040> higher

so the higher level you get the higher

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.889 
so the higher level you get the higher
up<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.460> tower<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:47.790> go<00:01:48.030> it's<00:01:48.450> kinda<00:01:48.780> like

up the tower you go it's kinda like

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.300 
up the tower you go it's kinda like
climbing<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.290> corporate<00:01:49.409> ladder<00:01:49.619> except

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
climbing the corporate ladder except

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.160 
climbing the corporate ladder except
that<00:01:50.460> it's<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.610> tower<00:01:50.790> then<00:01:51.450> there<00:01:51.810> are<00:01:51.899> stairs

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
that it's a tower then there are stairs

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.740 
that it's a tower then there are stairs
