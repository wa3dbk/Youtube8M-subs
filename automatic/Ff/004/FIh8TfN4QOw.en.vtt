00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.269
 hi everyone these days we get 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.099
 found today for a new 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.460
 video is so today we get 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.500
 found for a species of small one 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.439
 kind of little tutorial that will you 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.930
 to find the portal of 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.640
 länder therefore the Länder portal which 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.840
 is not yet accessible but you 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.869
 you can still find it 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.210
 maybe for future uses 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.170
 or low for pleasure since you 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.120
 go and see that it's a 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.730
 room that is quite worked on the legs 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.160
 so who have worked quite a lot this 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.469
 room has so right away without more 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.730
 delay we will start the video so 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.710
 come with great videos end of the day 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.180
 come there so you will not hear it but 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.980
 he with me he'll be with me during 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.230
 the video 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.270
 so we will start right after published 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.690
 so created a world to prove to you 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.650
 even though it's not me who has it 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:06.540
 who does what the Länder portal 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.710
 so then there you can see so I 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.720
 but he's going to play games 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.520
 line allowed the friends of friends we get 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.500
 in fact you're wondering so I 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:18.430
 go flat m to be able to have a map 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.870
 pretty flat but not 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.640
 extra flat since actually if you 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.530
 put then I will show you if 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.290
 you put the option less than super flat 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:30.430
 it will not work and you if you and 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:33.330
 if you try this tutorial on so a 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:37.420
 old map before the update 1.0.1 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.170
 if you do these tutorials on 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.050
 an old map 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.880
 well it will not work either so 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.160
 here you have to either recreate the world 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.869
 a world of self if you have it if you 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:51.430
 had a world after the update that 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:54.280
 will be perfect to let by whoever is there 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.009
 going to go so not created the world has more 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.530
 options do not care we leave like this 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:04.540
 and you create world 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.720
 so here's the fox write you go 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:14.410
 wait until that's okay 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:19.240
 little bit of time 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.190
 be careful it's going to happen so it's actually good 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.960
 the reindeer tutorial it will consist in fact 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.310
 you have the duty to throw the eye of 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.050
 länder is so once you have it 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.910
 to throw low you must you must the 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.290
 follow all the way so I do not know 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.390
 if I put creative anyway if I 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.830
 did not put i'll go quickly m that 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.130
 will be much easier for us to 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:48.820
 did not look for länder 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:50.640
 so no so I like of course I quickly 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:54.630
 going fast and going to the creative 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.980
 here I'm crushing myself chiefs and just for 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.690
 breaking the head were details 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.040
 nerves and so what 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.230
 so we put the map to create them 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:09.190
 yes as well do it in survival if 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.550
 you have anahein ducks so that's it 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:18.670
 play we will put in creative mode of 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:20.970
 pacify here it is gone so there a 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.410
 time you have to tell you this pony by that 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.280
 you're going to have to go from your 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.330
 inventory 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.459
 I'll do it right now 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:32.380
 So you go to various you have to 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.880
 are in winter you take the night 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:39.730
 last several so with the eye 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.080
 dender leaning on them so hold 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.520
 you will see when he learns you 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.640
 press lte and he'll go to a 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.180
 direction is going to explode and so they 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.390
 fall 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.550
 it may be a gift that falls back then 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.580
 you see pretty much the direction so 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.050
 good the direction against towards 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.140
 over there so we will move a little bit 

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:00.400
 we will avoid wasting time here at 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.250
 as and when white is actually 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.270
 the goal is to keep to the paste 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.830
 but the on so for now the 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.750
 launch 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.820
 big what then there since I believe it 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.030
 will go over there I'm going to see 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.030
 over there 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.660
 so here is his tip and a little bit to the 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.710
 down what then will you still support 

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.580
 evening the debate 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:28.080
 so here he turned around 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.810
 land so here you'll go there 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:33.660
 where you will follow him 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.050
 more and so the theory at the foot of this 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:44.760
 tree so we're going to dig 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:47.190
 you can see already I have too much 

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.730
 so here we are you notice and having 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.890
 dig 

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:56.280
 so either you land directly 

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:57.270
 so in the portal without you 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.770
 land in this room 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:04.230
 so this piece is like home 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:06.390
 there are a lot of feints so no that so 

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:09.000
 the way that you have to find for there 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.470
 to go ben it's just here so 

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.710
 you will have this door you go down 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:12.710
 stairs 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:20.370
 yeah but so that will not always be the 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.590
 same place according to your map what if where 

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:24.660
 according to the seed and also according to you 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.030
 so take there you go straight on 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:30.680
 and you arrive at a desert gate 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:34.410
 to silander pardon that is all done 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:35.850
 so that's how you can that 

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.140
 it's the portal and the Länder 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:37.830
 original you can see that there is a 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:41.970
 little eye 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:44.850
 so on this particular block there so 

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.020
 it surely means that it will happen 

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:47.550
 in the next updates for 

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.980
 activate it because in fact to activate it 

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:52.290
 we must aim to support this reality but 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.870
 good where you see that we can not 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.990
 not on xbox 360 yet the current one so we 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:01.080
 you start a heart hearth he does not move 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.490
 more what so well is going even little bit 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.000
 all that can make you visit the 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.190
 surroundings 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:10.160
 so there and without further ado you can 

00:06:05.190 --> 00:06:12.550
 see a minor mode so if it's a word 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.730
 happiness miss hen d 

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.110
 wolves or to see the king since that's 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:22.390
 a wolf turns usually it is of 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:25.390
 pigs here is also no ah there is not bad 

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:26.250
 good parts that are empty to 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.810
 stairs 

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:33.520
 So here we go we go 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.530
 continue to the door why not so 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.640
 after that little effort it often depends 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.880
 from your corner 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:47.340
 if you have no more things there he 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:50.410
 is the water that was written ster here so 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:54.480
 in fact it's not just the portal 

00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:57.820
 but still small structure 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:59.860
 yeah so good it would not be great 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:01.110
 thing like this since you 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:04.150
 go pretend to yourself 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.280
 so that's where now you know 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:09.880
 how to access the original portal 

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:15.040
 original of länder so on minecraft 

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:16.930
