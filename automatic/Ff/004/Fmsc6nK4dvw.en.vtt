SK 1200 point 1 which you can see here
on<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> Left<00:00:14.150> we<00:00:15.150> have<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.269> meters<00:00:15.599> hooked<00:00:15.809> up

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
on the Left we have the meters hooked up

on the Left we have the meters hooked up
to<00:00:16.170> it<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.379> we<00:00:16.470> can<00:00:16.590> get<00:00:16.650> a<00:00:16.710> clamp<00:00:16.980> test<00:00:17.279> out<00:00:17.460> of

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
to it so we can get a clamp test out of

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.720 
to it so we can get a clamp test out of
it<00:00:17.699> you'll<00:00:18.029> also<00:00:18.180> see<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.109> brand<00:00:19.680> new<00:00:19.830> scar<00:00:20.250> SK

cabin right now which you can see and
that's<00:00:47.070> wired<00:00:47.610> down<00:00:47.820> to<00:00:48.000> 2<00:00:48.210> ohms<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.840> we're

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
that's wired down to 2 ohms so we're

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.510 
that's wired down to 2 ohms so we're
gonna<00:00:49.260> go<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.649> see<00:00:49.770> what<00:00:49.890> kind<00:00:50.070> of<00:00:50.129> power<00:00:50.309> this

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
gonna go and see what kind of power this

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.209 
gonna go and see what kind of power this
this<00:00:50.910> new<00:00:51.090> 1200<00:00:51.600> watt<00:00:51.719> amp<00:00:51.930> can<00:00:52.110> put<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.440> at<00:00:52.829> 2

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
this new 1200 watt amp can put out at 2

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.310 
this new 1200 watt amp can put out at 2
ohms<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.850> like<00:00:54.329> I<00:00:54.449> said<00:00:54.660> we<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.899> our<00:00:54.930> meters

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
ohms and like I said we have our meters

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.299 
ohms and like I said we have our meters
here<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.680> I'm<00:00:55.739> gonna<00:00:55.829> go<00:00:55.920> ahead<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.100> turn

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
here so I'm gonna go ahead and turn

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.160 
here so I'm gonna go ahead and turn
these<00:00:56.430> on

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
these on

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.380 
these on
right<00:00:58.740> now<00:00:58.920> we<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.220> the<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.370> volume<00:01:00.240> all<00:01:00.360> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
right now we have the the volume all the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.470 
right now we have the the volume all the
way<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.600> on<00:01:01.230> my<00:01:01.440> dash<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.820> game<00:01:03.090> turned

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
way up on my dash and the game turned

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.520 
way up on my dash and the game turned
all<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.690> way<00:01:03.780> down<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.170> amp<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.440> we're

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
all the way down on the amp so we're

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.900 
all the way down on the amp so we're
gonna<00:01:04.620> go<00:01:04.800> to<00:01:04.860> turn<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.250> gain<00:01:05.460> up<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.790> see

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:05.910 
gonna go to turn this gain up and see

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.100 
gonna go to turn this gain up and see
what<00:01:06.030> kind<00:01:06.180> of<00:01:06.240> power<00:01:06.390> getting<00:01:06.840> out<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.050> the

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
what kind of power getting out of the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:32.859 
what kind of power getting out of the
same<00:01:07.290> fat<00:01:07.530> 2<00:01:07.710> ohms<00:01:08.240> again<00:01:09.240> 50<00:01:09.570> Hertz<00:01:09.750> test<00:01:10.050> tone

pushing the scars DV x-15 as you can see
we're<00:03:58.610> sitting<00:03:58.880> about<00:03:59.030> 40<00:03:59.510> AC<00:03:59.660> volts<00:04:00.200> there

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
we're sitting about 40 AC volts there

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.640 
we're sitting about 40 AC volts there
and<00:04:00.680> about<00:04:01.220> 15<00:04:01.700> amps<00:04:02.110> so<00:04:03.110> it's<00:04:03.410> right<00:04:03.560> around

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:03.650 
and about 15 amps so it's right around

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.760 
and about 15 amps so it's right around
550<00:04:04.340> watts<00:04:04.730> got<00:04:05.300> it<00:04:05.420> up<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.540> 600<00:04:06.020> 600<00:04:06.620> watts

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:06.770 
550 watts got it up to 600 600 watts

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:09.340 
550 watts got it up to 600 600 watts
during<00:04:07.100> that<00:04:07.220> video<00:04:07.750> very<00:04:08.750> very<00:04:08.840> impressive

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.170 
amplifier as you can see it's extremely
compact<00:04:12.280> so<00:04:13.280> it's<00:04:13.430> quite<00:04:13.580> the<00:04:13.640> powerhouse

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
compact so it's quite the powerhouse

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.750 
compact so it's quite the powerhouse
features<00:04:14.630> 4<00:04:14.900> gauge<00:04:15.080> inputs<00:04:15.530> which<00:04:15.770> might<00:04:16.670> be

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
features 4 gauge inputs which might be

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.099 
features 4 gauge inputs which might be
kind<00:04:16.910> of<00:04:17.030> hard<00:04:17.209> to<00:04:17.269> see<00:04:17.510> here<00:04:17.540> with<00:04:17.840> all<00:04:17.959> the

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
kind of hard to see here with all the

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:21.099 
kind of hard to see here with all the
meters<00:04:18.950> and<00:04:19.220> whatnot<00:04:19.549> but<00:04:19.870> very<00:04:20.870> very

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
meters and whatnot but very very

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.690 
meters and whatnot but very very
impressive<00:04:21.470> amplifier<00:04:21.980> these<00:04:22.190> are<00:04:22.340> 1<00:04:22.550> ohm

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
impressive amplifier these are 1 ohm

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.900 
impressive amplifier these are 1 ohm
stable<00:04:23.180> puts<00:04:24.110> that<00:04:24.230> around<00:04:24.470> 1300<00:04:25.100> watts<00:04:25.280> at<00:04:25.460> 14

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
stable puts that around 1300 watts at 14

like<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:28.920> said<00:04:29.130> that's<00:04:29.280> the<00:04:29.490> the<00:04:29.820> brand-new<00:04:30.090> 125

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
like I said that's the the brand-new 125
