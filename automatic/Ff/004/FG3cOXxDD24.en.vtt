00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
announced now on top of that like I said

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.150

before<00:02:12.180> LG<00:02:12.870> has<00:02:13.200> already<00:02:13.470> started<00:02:13.860> mass

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
before LG has already started mass

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.640 
before LG has already started mass
production<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.880> their<00:02:15.209> own<00:02:15.420> flexible<00:02:16.290> display
