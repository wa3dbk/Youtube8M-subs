upcoming new cars and we've been living

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.100 
upcoming new cars and we've been living
with<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.640> system<00:00:35.940> for<00:00:36.149> for<00:00:36.660> what<00:00:36.809> is<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:36.989> now<00:00:37.079> a

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
with the system for for what is it now a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.869 
with the system for for what is it now a
month<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.590> month<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.920> a<00:00:37.980> half<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.340> really<00:00:38.760> can

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
month a month and a half you really can

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.400 
month a month and a half you really can
sort<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> swap<00:00:39.360> back<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> forth<00:00:40.020> between<00:00:40.140> the

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
sort of swap back and forth between the

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.690 
sort of swap back and forth between the
two<00:00:40.559> environments<00:00:40.860> what<00:00:41.280> you're<00:00:41.370> looking<00:00:41.579> at

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
two environments what you're looking at

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.910 
two environments what you're looking at
here<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.149> screen<00:00:42.450> now<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:43.020> apple's

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
here on the screen now is apple's

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.670 
here on the screen now is apple's
carplay<00:00:44.160> system<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.120> this<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.960> navigation

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
carplay system so this is navigation

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.220 
carplay system so this is navigation
happening<00:00:47.309> literally<00:00:47.940> off<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.210> phone<00:00:48.629> there

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
happening literally off the phone there

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.229 
happening literally off the phone there
is<00:00:49.350> no<00:00:49.530> built-in<00:00:49.890> nav<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.579> system<00:00:51.000> so

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
is no built-in nav to the system so

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.000 
is no built-in nav to the system so
what's<00:00:51.390> really<00:00:51.539> nice<00:00:51.750> about<00:00:51.809> having<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.410> off

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
what's really nice about having that off

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.709 
what's really nice about having that off
board<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.730> actually<00:00:54.090> having<00:00:54.300> everything<00:00:54.480> in

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
board and actually having everything in

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.660 
board and actually having everything in
your<00:00:54.870> smartphone<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.039> much<00:00:56.190> smarter

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
your smartphone is that as much smarter

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.580 
your smartphone is that as much smarter
in<00:00:56.789> terms<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.750> points<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.140> interest<00:00:58.350> so

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
in terms of the points of interest so

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.630 
in terms of the points of interest so
you<00:00:58.680> could<00:00:58.800> say<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.010> know<00:00:59.129> take<00:00:59.399> me<00:00:59.520> to

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
is um because it's pulling it directly

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.690 
is um because it's pulling it directly
from<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.350> internet<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:05.040> pulling<00:01:05.309> from<00:01:05.580> the

there<00:01:10.130> whereas<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.450> built-in<00:01:12.450> systems<00:01:12.990> in

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
there whereas the built-in systems in

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.990 
there whereas the built-in systems in
the<00:01:13.290> cars<00:01:13.500> they're<00:01:13.890> just<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.159> far<00:01:14.369> behind<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.970> I

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the cars they're just so far behind so I

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.880 
the cars they're just so far behind so I
think<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.299> will<00:01:15.509> maybe<00:01:16.170> be<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.530> end<00:01:16.680> of<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
think it will maybe be the end of the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100 
think it will maybe be the end of the
road<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.070> these<00:01:17.520> very<00:01:17.970> expensive<00:01:18.210> in-car

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
mean people are used to that environment

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100 
mean people are used to that environment
they're<00:01:41.520> used<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.790> these<00:01:41.909> icons<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:43.020> gonna

be very comfortable to them as opposed

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.340 
be very comfortable to them as opposed
to<00:01:44.790> some<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.299> car<00:01:45.450> manufacturers<00:01:46.140> that

to some of the car manufacturers that
kind<00:01:46.500> of<00:01:46.560> have<00:01:46.649> their<00:01:46.799> own<00:01:46.860> environment<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
kind of have their own environment and

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.859 
kind of have their own environment and
people<00:01:47.820> are<00:01:47.909> trying<00:01:48.270> to<00:01:48.390> figure<00:01:48.570> out<00:01:48.720> what

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
people are trying to figure out what

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.600 
people are trying to figure out what
those<00:01:48.990> icons<00:01:49.380> are<00:01:49.649> there's<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> lot<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.340> sort<00:01:50.549> of

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
those icons are there's a lot of sort of

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.730 
those icons are there's a lot of sort of
clunky<00:01:50.970> back-alley<00:01:51.570> seat<00:01:51.990> into<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.380> systems

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
clunky back-alley seat into the systems

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.830 
clunky back-alley seat into the systems
where<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.579> functionality<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.570> kind<00:01:54.780> of

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
where the functionality is just kind of

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.440 
where the functionality is just kind of
leaves<00:01:55.320> you<00:01:55.560> with<00:01:55.850> deadness<00:01:56.850> what<00:01:57.240> do<00:01:57.299> I<00:01:57.390> do

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
leaves you with deadness what do I do

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.749 
leaves you with deadness what do I do
with<00:01:57.689> this<00:01:57.899> which<00:01:58.649> can<00:01:58.829> actually<00:01:59.009> in<00:01:59.369> any<00:01:59.579> ways

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
with this which can actually in any ways

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.460 
with this which can actually in any ways
be<00:01:59.939> more<00:02:00.119> distracting

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
be more distracting

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.710 
be more distracting
and<00:02:01.620> then<00:02:02.370> just<00:02:02.790> not<00:02:03.030> giving<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
and then just not giving you the

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.480 
and then just not giving you the
functionality<00:02:04.050> at<00:02:04.380> all<00:02:04.530> but<00:02:04.890> look<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.160> mean<00:02:05.190> the

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
functionality at all but look I mean the

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.430 
functionality at all but look I mean the
thing<00:02:05.640> is<00:02:05.760> this<00:02:05.940> is<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.360> beta<00:02:06.600> level<00:02:06.840> one<00:02:07.140> right

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
thing is this is a beta level one right

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.749 
thing is this is a beta level one right
this<00:02:07.590> is<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.770> first<00:02:07.890> time<00:02:08.190> we've<00:02:08.399> done<00:02:08.430> this

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
this is the first time we've done this

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.639 
this is the first time we've done this
we're<00:02:09.479> not<00:02:09.630> ready<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.930> kind<00:02:10.170> of<00:02:10.200> write<00:02:10.470> this

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
we're not ready to kind of write this

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.980 
we're not ready to kind of write this

phone you've got the data plan anyway in
your<00:02:14.850> phone<00:02:15.120> but<00:02:15.810> right<00:02:16.020> now<00:02:16.200> yeah<00:02:16.860> it's<00:02:17.160> not<00:02:17.340> a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
your phone but right now yeah it's not a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.160 
your phone but right now yeah it's not a
single<00:02:18.120> system<00:02:18.270> I've<00:02:18.750> been<00:02:18.900> living<00:02:19.140> with

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
single system I've been living with

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.920 
single system I've been living with
carplay<00:02:19.860> in<00:02:20.010> my<00:02:20.160> car<00:02:20.430> for<00:02:20.730> for<00:02:21.510> quite<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:21.720> while

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
carplay in my car for for quite a while

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.170 
carplay in my car for for quite a while
now<00:02:21.990> your<00:02:22.530> actual<00:02:22.860> radio<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.460> not<00:02:23.490> baked<00:02:23.940> into

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
now your actual radio is not baked into

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.730 
now your actual radio is not baked into
the<00:02:24.450> car<00:02:24.600> play<00:02:24.780> environment<00:02:25.050> you<00:02:25.380> still<00:02:25.590> have

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
the car play environment you still have

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.140 
the car play environment you still have
to<00:02:25.890> do<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.190> through<00:02:26.490> whatever<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.940> car's

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
to do that through whatever the car's

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.120 
to do that through whatever the car's
system<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.750> well<00:02:28.320> this<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.650> exactly<00:02:28.920> right<00:02:29.100> so

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
system is well this is exactly right so

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.770 
system is well this is exactly right so
there's<00:02:29.400> two<00:02:29.550> different<00:02:29.580> ecosystems<00:02:30.570> you're

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
there's two different ecosystems you're

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.540 
there's two different ecosystems you're
dealing<00:02:31.140> with<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.830> could<00:02:32.010> actually<00:02:32.190> have<00:02:32.490> a

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
dealing with you could actually have a

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.690 
dealing with you could actually have a
nav<00:02:32.910> system<00:02:32.940> on<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.770> car<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.370> you<00:02:35.550> could<00:02:35.640> have

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
nav system on the car and you could have

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.490 
nav system on the car and you could have
a<00:02:35.760> nav<00:02:35.910> system<00:02:35.940> in-car<00:02:36.900> play<00:02:37.050> you<00:02:37.200> could<00:02:37.350> have

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
a nav system in-car play you could have

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.080 
a nav system in-car play you could have
your<00:02:37.860> music<00:02:38.220> in<00:02:38.370> different<00:02:38.610> ways<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:38.940> the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
your music in different ways and the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.760 
your music in different ways and the
problem<00:02:39.510> is<00:02:39.600> that<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.930> say<00:02:40.110> want<00:02:40.320> to<00:02:40.380> use<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
problem is that you say want to use the

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.560 
problem is that you say want to use the
navigation<00:02:41.340> system<00:02:41.670> from<00:02:41.850> your<00:02:41.970> phone<00:02:42.209> and

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
navigation system from your phone and

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.440 
navigation system from your phone and
then<00:02:42.930> listen<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.350> FM<00:02:43.980> or<00:02:44.310> XM<00:02:44.880> or<00:02:45.180> something

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
then listen to FM or XM or something

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.870 
then listen to FM or XM or something
like<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.890> you<00:02:46.890> can't<00:02:47.280> really<00:02:47.459> deal<00:02:47.730> with

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
like that you can't really deal with

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.250 
like that you can't really deal with
them<00:02:48.000> at<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.150> same<00:02:48.270> time<00:02:48.330> and<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.200> really

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
them at the same time and it's really

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.720 
them at the same time and it's really
the<00:02:49.560> problem<00:02:49.890> in<00:02:50.070> apple's<00:02:50.520> carplay

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:44.440 
it so I got my coffee and I think it's a

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:45.720 
it so I got my coffee and I think it's a
bad<00:03:44.560> time<00:03:44.770> when<00:03:44.890> we<00:03:44.980> switch<00:03:45.160> over<00:03:45.280> to<00:03:45.400> Android

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
bad time when we switch over to Android

bad time when we switch over to Android

way that apple's carplay does this is

not really utilizing the space very well

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.740 
not really utilizing the space very well
this<00:04:06.910> is<00:04:07.000> one<00:04:07.150> of<00:04:07.209> these<00:04:07.330> things<00:04:07.480> where<00:04:07.720> I

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
this is one of these things where I

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.449 
this is one of these things where I
think<00:04:07.870> you're<00:04:08.380> going<00:04:08.500> to<00:04:08.560> see<00:04:08.680> changes<00:04:08.709> going

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
think you're going to see changes going

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.040 
think you're going to see changes going
forward<00:04:09.580> and<00:04:10.209> I<00:04:10.420> think<00:04:10.630> part<00:04:10.870> of<00:04:10.959> the

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
forward and I think part of the

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.830 
forward and I think part of the
rationale<00:04:11.650> behind<00:04:11.830> Android<00:04:12.430> auto<00:04:12.640> is<00:04:13.030> that<00:04:13.540> it

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
rationale behind Android auto is that it

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.180 
rationale behind Android auto is that it
should<00:04:14.019> just<00:04:14.050> lean<00:04:14.410> heavily<00:04:14.680> on<00:04:14.890> voice

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
should just lean heavily on voice

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.650 
should just lean heavily on voice

so<00:04:32.480> one<00:04:32.570> of<00:04:32.600> the<00:04:32.690> interesting<00:04:32.810> things<00:04:33.200> about

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
so one of the interesting things about

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.960 
so one of the interesting things about
Android<00:04:33.800> auto<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.160> apple<00:04:34.430> carplay

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
Android auto and apple carplay

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.810 
Android auto and apple carplay
is<00:04:35.180> that<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:36.440> car<00:04:36.770> manufacturers<00:04:37.430> are<00:04:37.580> really

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
is that the car manufacturers are really

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:39.340 
is that the car manufacturers are really
kind<00:04:38.030> of<00:04:38.150> surrendering<00:04:38.600> the<00:04:38.870> interface

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
kind of surrendering the interface

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.000 
kind of surrendering the interface
somewhat<00:04:40.160> to<00:04:40.580> the<00:04:40.970> phone<00:04:41.300> manufacturers<00:04:42.010> yeah

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
somewhat to the phone manufacturers yeah

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.340 
somewhat to the phone manufacturers yeah
and<00:04:43.460> it<00:04:43.550> totally<00:04:43.880> makes<00:04:44.060> sense<00:04:44.450> because<00:04:44.720> it's

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
and it totally makes sense because it's

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.440 
and it totally makes sense because it's
the<00:04:45.590> phone<00:04:45.740> manufacturers<00:04:46.460> and<00:04:46.850> and<00:04:47.030> more

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450 
the phone manufacturers and and more

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.610 
the phone manufacturers and and more
importantly<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:47.930> phone<00:04:48.320> software

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
importantly the phone software

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.100 
importantly the phone software
manufacturers<00:04:49.490> there's<00:04:49.700> way<00:04:50.090> out<00:04:50.390> ahead

about<00:05:08.960> it

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
about it

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.260 
about it
but<00:05:09.650> is<00:05:09.740> it<00:05:09.830> less<00:05:10.190> distracting<00:05:10.850> than<00:05:10.970> actually

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
but is it less distracting than actually

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.970 
but is it less distracting than actually
picking<00:05:11.540> up<00:05:11.750> your<00:05:11.930> phone<00:05:12.110> and<00:05:12.170> using<00:05:12.890> the

better<00:05:14.990> so<00:05:15.500> anything<00:05:15.710> Glen<00:05:15.980> Eden<00:05:16.160> ones<00:05:16.460> better

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:16.640 
better so anything Glen Eden ones better

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:17.950 
better so anything Glen Eden ones better
than<00:05:16.820> the<00:05:16.910> other<00:05:17.120> actually<00:05:17.690> I<00:05:17.750> don't<00:05:17.810> think

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
than the other actually I don't think

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.330 
than the other actually I don't think
it's<00:05:18.170> a<00:05:18.230> one<00:05:18.380> versus<00:05:18.740> the<00:05:18.830> other<00:05:18.860> type<00:05:19.190> of

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
it's a one versus the other type of

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.310 
it's a one versus the other type of
situation<00:05:19.940> you're<00:05:20.360> going<00:05:20.480> to<00:05:20.540> use<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:21.140> system

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
situation you're going to use the system

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:22.690 
situation you're going to use the system
that<00:05:21.620> matches<00:05:21.770> your<00:05:22.100> phone<00:05:22.340> and<00:05:22.640> the

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:22.700 
that matches your phone and the

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.190 
that matches your phone and the
manufacturers<00:05:23.240> know<00:05:23.420> that<00:05:23.630> because<00:05:23.810> most<00:05:24.080> of

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
manufacturers know that because most of

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.780 
manufacturers know that because most of
them<00:05:24.350> are<00:05:24.440> offering<00:05:24.950> both<00:05:25.190> systems<00:05:25.640> on

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
them are offering both systems on

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:27.640 
them are offering both systems on
upcoming<00:05:26.180> cars<00:05:26.390> so<00:05:26.960> how<00:05:27.080> does<00:05:27.140> this<00:05:27.260> compare

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
upcoming cars so how does this compare

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.110 
upcoming cars so how does this compare
with<00:05:27.710> just<00:05:28.070> taking<00:05:28.430> your<00:05:28.520> phone<00:05:28.730> and<00:05:28.940> putting

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
with just taking your phone and putting

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:30.790 
with just taking your phone and putting
it<00:05:29.210> up<00:05:29.270> on<00:05:29.360> your<00:05:29.480> dashboard<00:05:29.690> it's<00:05:30.410> actually

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
it up on your dashboard it's actually

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.740 
it up on your dashboard it's actually
really<00:05:30.980> good<00:05:31.160> question<00:05:31.790> um<00:05:31.940> if<00:05:32.330> you<00:05:32.480> put<00:05:32.630> your

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
really good question um if you put your

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.880 
really good question um if you put your
phone<00:05:32.870> up<00:05:32.990> on<00:05:33.110> your<00:05:33.200> dashboard<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:33.710> there's

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:33.890 
phone up on your dashboard and there's

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:36.010 
phone up on your dashboard and there's
some<00:05:34.070> decent<00:05:34.280> holders<00:05:34.790> there<00:05:35.030> you<00:05:35.480> get<00:05:35.690> the

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
some decent holders there you get the

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.659 
some decent holders there you get the
same<00:05:36.200> functionality<00:05:36.650> what<00:05:37.070> you<00:05:37.190> don't<00:05:37.430> get<00:05:37.610> is

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 
same functionality what you don't get is

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:38.890 
same functionality what you don't get is
the<00:05:37.880> bigger<00:05:38.030> screen<00:05:38.419> you<00:05:38.630> don't<00:05:38.810> get

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
the bigger screen you don't get

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:41.920 
the bigger screen you don't get

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:55.370 
improvement that you're going to get but

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.950 
improvement that you're going to get but
I<00:05:55.400> would<00:05:55.640> say<00:05:55.880> that<00:05:56.090> your<00:05:56.240> car<00:05:56.419> comes<00:05:56.630> with<00:05:56.840> us

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:56.960 
I would say that your car comes with us

you are going to wind up using it is

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.640 
you are going to wind up using it is
better<00:05:58.850> it<00:05:59.150> is<00:05:59.270> a<00:05:59.300> better<00:05:59.510> interface<00:05:59.780> would<00:06:00.440> I

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
better it is a better interface would I

better it is a better interface would I
