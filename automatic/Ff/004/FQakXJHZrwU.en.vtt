new for her and five if you haven't seen
him<00:03:33.209> before<00:03:33.329> they<00:03:34.019> had<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:35.489> completely

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
him before they had a completely

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.490 
him before they had a completely
different<00:03:36.360> stage<00:03:36.510> setup<00:03:36.750> it's<00:03:36.989> not<00:03:37.110> just<00:03:37.320> like

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
different stage setup it's not just like

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.210 
different stage setup it's not just like
an<00:03:37.769> end<00:03:37.980> stage<00:03:38.310> like<00:03:38.670> normal<00:03:39.060> it's<00:03:39.299> an<00:03:39.630> M<00:03:39.870> and<00:03:40.220> I

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
an end stage like normal it's an M and I

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.340 
an end stage like normal it's an M and I
guess<00:03:41.730> there<00:03:41.970> cat<00:03:42.239> walks<00:03:42.269> could<00:03:42.870> be<00:03:42.989> the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
guess there cat walks could be the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.910 
guess there cat walks could be the
points<00:03:44.130> of<00:03:44.220> the<00:03:44.340> em<00:03:44.489> but<00:03:45.390> they<00:03:46.350> had<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.590> bridge

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
points of the em but they had a bridge

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.580 
points of the em but they had a bridge
that<00:03:47.430> came<00:03:47.730> down<00:03:47.970> during<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.420> Encore<00:03:48.660> and<00:03:49.200> it

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
that came down during the Encore and it

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.009 
that came down during the Encore and it
linked<00:03:49.920> from<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.549> main<00:03:50.850> stage<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.750> a<00:03:51.780> be

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019
