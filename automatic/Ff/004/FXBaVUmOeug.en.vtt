 console 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:57.640
 here you scroll here if you go to screen 4 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:01.110
 you click update ok 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.110
 to accept 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.930
 it will establish a connection with the 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.909
 internet and it will appear in your eye 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.009

 with this parental control business is 

00:01:55.569 --> 00:02:01.539
 because you need one of these 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.569
 business to make an account nor a tent 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.260

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:17.840
 there you see is conquer this one you 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:19.340
 configure your connection, right? 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.050
 Excuse one here to show it to 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:26.960
 you who do you have to come here 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:31.070
 in a new cyclic connection and do not need 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:37.850
 you will look for an access point to 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:39.950
 they expect rock and then you select 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.810
 one already touched on the right set up then 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.180
 I will configure the hamburger that is 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:48.640
 another point today of my cause here 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.640
 Back there, just password. 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:57.160
 Okay, so it will change 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.160
 And then you give it ok, okay, okay? 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.300
 and then 3ds will perform a test of 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.260
 connection in the province your internet is 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.330
 working 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.060
 and this you can connect to the internet 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:10.940
 it is because sometimes it has some types of 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.310
 3ds can not do it with faith is 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.040
 connect ok until completed 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.020
 It worked there as you see it. 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.510
 now I'm going to delete it because it 's 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:23.300
 interference because of the type of 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:28.660
 sign is closer to soccernet is and is 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.660
 a little better and you close 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:38.540
 So what is it going to leave and now is the time 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.910
 to download is either 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.560

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.070
 One thing I have to warn you. 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:48.110
 now depending on the flame of the 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.200
 region that you chair ciro 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:54.470
 oceanic network is configured 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:58.010
 the price of pokémon x will only be 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:04:01.610
 different then it will depend on 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:05.860
 But you'll wait and stay put. 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.840
 verifying the data of the network such south 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:13.270
 Ok let's see let's wait a little 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.270

 on the scene only understand shopping can not're 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:52.199
 It seems like it is but at the moment it 's here. 

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:54.900
 I'm good here because it 's an x and because 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:57.030
 do not ask him if he does not have an opinion 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.880
 as if you were years and come here in 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:04.949

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:07.349
 pokémon y in case you come here it 's there 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:09.870

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:11.430
 that does not say a pokémon and in the market 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:15.509

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.810
 dollars 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.930
 but I advise you not to 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:28.259
 believe the claims to not put 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.050
 andes credits to buy the type galley 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:33.780
 You only have 10 or 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.960
 depend on how much you have 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:43.440
 one with less I do not know there and you will stay in 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:45.500

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.469
 not enough 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:54.150
 then he will show his balance and says that the 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.039
 price of the business right 

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:59.219
 they are seeing here that has increased 5 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:02.280

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:11.340
