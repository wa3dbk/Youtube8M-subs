normal vm hunger and eyes have gone and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.780 
normal vm hunger and eyes have gone and
basically<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.680> mother<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.950> reactivates

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
basically and the mother of reactivates

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.370 
basically and the mother of reactivates
this<00:01:50.939> magnitude<00:01:51.390> Shangguan<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.049> then<00:01:52.259> they

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
this magnitude Shangguan and then they

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.840 
this magnitude Shangguan and then they
both<00:01:52.560> end<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.920> in<00:01:53.009> this<00:01:53.130> massive<00:01:53.430> big<00:01:53.729> ass

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
both end up in this massive big ass

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.020 
both end up in this massive big ass
crater<00:01:54.210> totally<00:01:55.020> worn<00:01:55.229> out<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:56.340> this<00:01:56.610> crater

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
crater totally worn out and this crater

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.480 
crater totally worn out and this crater
if<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.780> look<00:01:57.960> carefully<00:01:58.170> there's<00:01:59.070> a<00:01:59.219> trickle

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
if you look carefully there's a trickle

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.590 
if you look carefully there's a trickle
of<00:01:59.520> water<00:01:59.579> coming<00:01:59.969> down<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.329> middle<00:02:00.479> and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
of water coming down the middle and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.819 
of water coming down the middle and
they're<00:02:00.750> talking<00:02:00.869> about<00:02:01.020> crossing<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.649> river

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
they're talking about crossing the river

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:04.819 
they're talking about crossing the river
it's<00:02:02.670> the<00:02:02.909> value<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.450> end<00:02:03.649> this<00:02:04.649> is

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
it's the value of the end this is

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.440 
it's the value of the end this is
important<00:02:05.430> because<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.790> think<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.149> is<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
important because I think this is the

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.479 
important because I think this is the
same<00:02:06.810> location<00:02:07.020> or<00:02:07.590> at<00:02:07.680> least<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.950> same<00:02:08.190> river

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
same location or at least the same river

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.669 
same location or at least the same river
as<00:02:08.849> tough<00:02:09.509> as<00:02:09.660> what<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.289> know<00:02:10.410> when<00:02:10.530> they<00:02:10.590> were

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
as tough as what you know when they were

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:11.950 
as tough as what you know when they were
throwing<00:02:10.920> stones<00:02:11.099> across<00:02:11.370> but

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
throwing stones across but

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.200 
throwing stones across but
in<00:02:12.020> the<00:02:12.440> Senju<00:02:12.860> territory<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.730> Uchiha

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
in the Senju territory the Uchiha

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.090 
in the Senju territory the Uchiha
territory<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.930> that's<00:02:15.320> why<00:02:15.560> it's<00:02:15.740> called<00:02:15.920> the

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
territory and that's why it's called the

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.070 
territory and that's why it's called the
valley<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.460> the<00:02:16.580> end<00:02:16.880> or<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:17.600> value<00:02:17.960> of<00:02:18.020> the

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
valley of the end or the value of the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.900 
valley of the end or the value of the
greatest<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:19.130> that<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.490> probably<00:02:19.700> because

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
greatest and that is probably because

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.700 
greatest and that is probably because
obviously<00:02:20.840> this<00:02:21.110> is<00:02:21.230> where<00:02:21.380> they<00:02:21.470> first

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:21.710 
obviously this is where they first

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.890 
obviously this is where they first
fought<00:02:22.220> and<00:02:22.490> they're<00:02:23.000> back<00:02:23.150> here<00:02:23.390> again<00:02:23.510> and

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
fought and they're back here again and

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.380 
fought and they're back here again and
it's<00:02:24.380> quite<00:02:24.890> a<00:02:25.160> moving<00:02:25.490> chapter<00:02:26.150> in<00:02:26.240> that

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
it's quite a moving chapter in that

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.410 
it's quite a moving chapter in that
respect<00:02:26.840> because<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:28.400> gets<00:02:28.670> pretty<00:02:29.060> dark

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
respect because it gets pretty dark

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.410 
respect because it gets pretty dark
because<00:02:29.990> what<00:02:30.860> hashirama<00:02:31.280> does<00:02:31.700> for<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.150> sake

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
because what hashirama does for the sake

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.990 
because what hashirama does for the sake
of<00:02:32.450> the<00:02:32.750> village<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:33.520> pretty<00:02:34.520> damn<00:02:34.730> impressive

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
of the village is pretty damn impressive

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.090 
of the village is pretty damn impressive
he<00:02:35.420> is<00:02:35.540> able<00:02:35.720> to<00:02:35.930> do<00:02:36.080> what<00:02:36.290> naruto<00:02:36.500> probably

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
he is able to do what naruto probably

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.190 
he is able to do what naruto probably
will<00:02:37.220> not<00:02:37.400> be<00:02:37.610> able<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.940> do<00:02:38.210> and<00:02:38.450> he's<00:02:38.930> thinking

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
will not be able to do and he's thinking

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.720 
will not be able to do and he's thinking
right<00:02:39.380> for<00:02:39.710> the<00:02:39.770> sake<00:02:39.920> of<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.130> village<00:02:40.160> i<00:02:40.490> will

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.470 
matter site this time I'm the last one
standing<00:02:45.770> patterns<00:02:46.490> on<00:02:46.610> the<00:02:46.670> floor<00:02:46.880> spin<00:02:47.270> is

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
standing patterns on the floor spin is

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.450 
standing patterns on the floor spin is
bleeding<00:02:47.960> everybody's<00:02:48.350> it's<00:02:48.800> like<00:02:48.920> this<00:02:49.250> time

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
reality and then she sticks him straight

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.100 
reality and then she sticks him straight
to<00:02:55.160> the<00:02:55.280> bat<00:02:55.490> katana<00:02:56.330> blade<00:02:56.570> coming<00:02:56.840> out<00:02:56.990> his

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
to the bat katana blade coming out his

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.780 
to the bat katana blade coming out his
chest<00:02:57.350> and<00:02:57.620> matters<00:02:57.830> like<00:02:57.980> you<00:02:58.340> struck<00:02:58.670> me

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
chest and matters like you struck me

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.340 
chest and matters like you struck me
from<00:02:58.940> behind<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.570> then<00:02:59.660> it<00:02:59.840> was<00:02:59.930> just<00:03:00.110> a<00:03:00.200> would

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
from behind and then it was just a would

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.610 
from behind and then it was just a would
clone<00:03:00.620> that<00:03:00.800> was<00:03:00.920> on<00:03:00.980> the<00:03:01.070> floor<00:03:01.280> so<00:03:02.200> this<00:03:03.200> was

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
clone that was on the floor so this was

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.200 
clone that was on the floor so this was
quite<00:03:03.800> powerful<00:03:04.340> for<00:03:04.460> me<00:03:04.490> because<00:03:04.880> hashirama

quite powerful for me because hashirama

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:07.120 
quite powerful for me because hashirama
would<00:03:05.660> forsake<00:03:06.020> his<00:03:06.230> friend<00:03:06.590> for<00:03:06.830> the<00:03:06.890> sake<00:03:07.100> of
