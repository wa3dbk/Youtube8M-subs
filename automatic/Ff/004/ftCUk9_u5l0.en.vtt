00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.740
 this was perhaps the best match he has 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.830
 played mouth in the tournament and then if 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.430
 reflected on the playing field maybe not 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.960
 be marked in the final score or 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.490
 it seems like that mouth could have 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.160
 maybe converted up to more goals 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:27.980
 still yes, it's a pretty game 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.980
 interesting I think that production can 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:34.290
 very good and we sure could 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.050
 to have made one of the goals more but 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.160
 good how important it was earned and what 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.150
 important also is that we do not 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.030
 they made goals so that not only 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.670
 which makes no attack or what 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.140
 they produce the goal situations are 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.809
 happy but also the people who 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.190
 he defends that it is that he also wins well 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:56.610
 the matches put us zero in the goal 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.710
 of one and for them good by morally 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.600
 when he had to see the individual for 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.519
 that the collective works and how much 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.920
 had to see the collective of the pose 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:09.450
 that you thought so that mouth could 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.450
 have so many good individualities 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.540
 I believe that 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.020
 one can play individually but 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.610
 always thinking collectively because 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.990
 if you can not have an attractive football 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.880
 because if you think only about playing 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.290
 individually and not collectively not 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.610
 you can take it very far because to the 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:32.380
 long the individual can not win one 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.530
 about the game then we need to 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.680
 everyone and the important thing that we put together 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.780
 many good feet he tried to handle 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.549
 quite the ball and 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.049
 even though the field was very 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:49.420
 difficult I think it was a very game 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.490
 of a high technical level not above all 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.470
 two short questions some I want 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.750
 ask for a paragraph about fernando gago the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.740
 acting of him and second within the 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.600
 irregularity that has been showing 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.090
 football and that you have scored 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.770
 also marked at some point and mouth 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.890
 maybe he's missing these good matches 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.770
 a bit of forcefulness in the rival arch 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.580
 with respect to fernando I think it is 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.240
 demonstrating all its level 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.680
 and 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.780
 as players the midfielder of the 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.330
 Argentine team then has to 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.030
 have a very good level and I do not have 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:28.110
 the luck of having him and then what 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.700
 we take advantage and the two parties he made 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:35.500
 starting with the team we made 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:39.030
 very good level with respect to the others 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.710
 and sure that sometimes it can still be that 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.720
 and 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.060
 sometimes it can be that one can think 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.980
 that efficiency is needed but also a 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.350
 little bit of luck sometimes necessary for 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.819
 the silver that passes next to the stick that 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.950
 can give one foot that pardons the other 

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:58.440
 I do not know if we will have created above 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.450
 10 goal situations and leave when 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:05.050
 I think that alone 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.030
 one is frustrated a little but 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:09.280
 let's make a joke not if Maria 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.290
 theresia is happy 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.650
 carlos like the ones you love when you 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.650
 arrange 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.430
 true 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.260
 the negative aspect this match were 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:26.450
 the up and cataract injuries 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:29.940
 I'm more worried about the day because 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:33.090
 the one of insÃºa is 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:35.910
 when a false movement was missing that 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.630
 she did and she lumbarly that she 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:41.120
 have lumbar problems instead of 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.459
 daniele 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.200
 tomorrow we will know what the degree of 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.650
 injury but I think that is going to have 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.080
 with the easy three weeks quietly 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.959
 and attention that is a player that never 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.620
 is injured is never injured 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:01.310
 then only the weird but good 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.140
 felt nothing of the puncture injury 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.069
 he did not feel anything, he was not carrying the 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:08.940
 leg nothing then tomorrow we will know with 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:10.860
 your attitude 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.380
 the thirst and science attitude is said 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.120
 security will forgive for sure what is 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.310
 what he has just is fine he commented 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.750
 what was to associate players with good 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.079
 foot 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:25.320
 I enjoy it, it gave her pleasure to see how it 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:27.530
 They associated Mendez Gago Sanchez Minho himself 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.530
 ledezma 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:34.010
 yes but I like to have goals 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:37.120
 I like to see play well but I like to see 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:37.120
 goals also then 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.830
 Maybe it was not 30 minutes 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.680
 second goal and until 30 minutes I 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.469
 I had the possibility of spending more 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:51.469
 after having done 75 minutes of 

00:04:48.469 --> 00:04:53.240
 level that we had done then if 

00:04:51.469 --> 00:04:57.340
 you give the possibility to the adversary 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.340
 have some hope 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:03.500
 well we have to have that reality of 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:05.599
 that there are parties that I think 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.210
 they finish 3 to 0 4 to 0 and there were 4 

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.610
 Goal situations 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.259
 and today we ourselves two situations of 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.590
 goal easily and in the end we finished 

00:05:11.259 --> 00:05:16.270
 turning two I think it's going to go 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:19.150
 as I told him maybe he's already 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.430
 you found your post for ten years 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.430
 and I explained how the second one is on the 9th 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:26.409
 10 ago, 10 becomes 8 in eights 55 ago 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.839
 6 2 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.839
 it's that simple, it has a face 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:40.389
 but now that I'm very satisfied and 

00:05:36.989 --> 00:05:44.039
 well, we will continue persevering in 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.039
 that assumption with him
