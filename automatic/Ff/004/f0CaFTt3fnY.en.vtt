00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.080 
to simplify things for people a green
smoothie<00:00:25.990> is<00:00:26.470> really<00:00:26.890> easy<00:00:27.130> it's<00:00:27.550> basically

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:28.090 
smoothie is really easy it's basically

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.349 
smoothie is really easy it's basically
just<00:00:28.740> fruit<00:00:29.740> and<00:00:30.010> greens<00:00:30.460> blended<00:00:31.180> in<00:00:31.270> a

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
just fruit and greens blended in a

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.219 
just fruit and greens blended in a
blender<00:00:31.720> with<00:00:31.930> water<00:00:33.329> there<00:00:34.329> really<00:00:34.539> is<00:00:34.809> no

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:35.229 
blender with water there really is no

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:38.219 
blender with water there really is no
rule<00:00:35.739> about<00:00:36.100> how<00:00:36.519> much<00:00:36.940> fruit<00:00:37.300> versus<00:00:37.839> how

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:38.229 
rule about how much fruit versus how

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:39.809 
rule about how much fruit versus how
many<00:00:38.289> greens<00:00:38.800> you<00:00:39.069> should<00:00:39.249> put<00:00:39.399> in<00:00:39.489> your<00:00:39.639> green

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:39.819 
many greens you should put in your green

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:42.389 
many greens you should put in your green
smoothie<00:00:40.239> I<00:00:40.449> think<00:00:41.409> it<00:00:41.530> really<00:00:41.739> has<00:00:42.039> to<00:00:42.249> do

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
smoothie I think it really has to do

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:44.759 
smoothie I think it really has to do
with<00:00:42.550> your<00:00:42.729> preferences<00:00:43.420> if<00:00:43.929> you're<00:00:44.589> making

00:00:44.759 --> 00:00:44.769 
with your preferences if you're making

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.619 
with your preferences if you're making
green<00:00:45.190> smoothies<00:00:45.639> that<00:00:45.670> are<00:00:45.879> too<00:00:46.089> green<00:00:46.420> and

00:00:46.619 --> 00:00:46.629 
green smoothies that are too green and

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:48.809 
green smoothies that are too green and
you<00:00:47.289> don't<00:00:47.499> enjoy<00:00:47.769> the<00:00:47.949> taste<00:00:48.219> well<00:00:48.699> it's

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:48.819 
you don't enjoy the taste well it's

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:51.419 
you don't enjoy the taste well it's
really<00:00:48.969> simple<00:00:49.329> just<00:00:49.899> add<00:00:50.109> less<00:00:50.530> greens<00:00:50.949> if

00:00:51.419 --> 00:00:51.429 
really simple just add less greens if

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:54.299 
really simple just add less greens if
you<00:00:51.879> absolutely<00:00:52.170> don't<00:00:53.170> like<00:00:53.679> green

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:54.309 
you absolutely don't like green

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:56.759 
you absolutely don't like green
smoothies<00:00:54.909> with<00:00:55.089> leafy<00:00:55.449> greens<00:00:55.719> what<00:00:56.440> you<00:00:56.559> can

00:00:56.759 --> 00:00:56.769 
smoothies with leafy greens what you can

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.020 
smoothies with leafy greens what you can
do<00:00:56.979> instead<00:00:57.429> is<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:58.089> use<00:00:59.159> salary<00:01:00.159> just<00:01:00.459> a<00:01:00.670> few

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
do instead is to use salary just a few

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.939 
do instead is to use salary just a few
ribs<00:01:01.239> of<00:01:01.479> celery<00:01:01.510> chopped<00:01:02.229> up<00:01:02.469> you<00:01:02.619> can<00:01:02.799> put

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:02.949 
ribs of celery chopped up you can put

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:04.650 
ribs of celery chopped up you can put
them<00:01:03.039> in<00:01:03.159> your<00:01:03.249> blender<00:01:03.670> with<00:01:04.120> your<00:01:04.300> fruit

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:04.660 
them in your blender with your fruit

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.840 
them in your blender with your fruit
what<00:01:05.199> this<00:01:05.379> does<00:01:05.710> is<00:01:05.920> it<00:01:06.010> it<00:01:06.130> adds<00:01:06.370> some<00:01:06.730> more

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
what this does is it it adds some more

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.510 
what this does is it it adds some more
nutrition<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:07.630> also<00:01:08.020> adds<00:01:08.260> extra<00:01:08.950> fiber<00:01:09.220> as

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
nutrition and also adds extra fiber as

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.130 
nutrition and also adds extra fiber as
well<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.950> I<00:01:11.980> make<00:01:12.400> a<00:01:12.430> green<00:01:12.790> smoothie<00:01:13.140> every

I usually make a similar smoothie every
single<00:01:20.290> day<00:01:20.460> all<00:01:21.460> my<00:01:21.520> smoothies<00:01:22.360> have<00:01:22.870> in<00:01:23.140> them

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
single day all my smoothies have in them

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.860 
single day all my smoothies have in them
at<00:01:23.680> least<00:01:24.130> two<00:01:24.700> bananas<00:01:25.270> are<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:25.450> great<00:01:25.660> source

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
at least two bananas are a great source

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.840 
at least two bananas are a great source
of<00:01:26.020> potassium<00:01:26.290> but<00:01:27.100> they're<00:01:27.250> also<00:01:27.430> great

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
of potassium but they're also great

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:32.330 
of potassium but they're also great
source<00:01:28.120> of<00:01:28.360> vitamin<00:01:28.720> b6<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.650> manganese<00:01:30.550> a

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
source of vitamin b6 and manganese a

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.950 
source of vitamin b6 and manganese a
little<00:01:33.340> trick<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:33.730> I<00:01:34.030> learned<00:01:34.330> not<00:01:34.600> too<00:01:34.780> long

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
little trick that I learned not too long

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.070 
little trick that I learned not too long
ago<00:01:35.020> is<00:01:35.410> that<00:01:35.560> you<00:01:35.680> can<00:01:35.830> open<00:01:36.150> the<00:01:37.150> banana<00:01:37.510> from

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
ago is that you can open the banana from

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.770 
ago is that you can open the banana from
this<00:01:38.290> and<00:01:38.620> this<00:01:38.800> is<00:01:38.950> how<00:01:39.070> monkeys<00:01:39.520> do<00:01:39.760> it<00:01:39.910> so<00:01:40.750> I

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:40.780 
this and this is how monkeys do it so I

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.190 
this and this is how monkeys do it so I
thought<00:01:40.990> that<00:01:41.200> was<00:01:41.290> pretty<00:01:41.500> cool

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.179 

all<00:01:44.950> right<00:01:45.159> so<00:01:45.549> my<00:01:46.240> smoothies<00:01:46.990> also<00:01:47.649> have<00:01:47.979> at

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
all right so my smoothies also have at

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.279 
all right so my smoothies also have at
least<00:01:48.430> one<00:01:48.820> Apple<00:01:49.360> this<00:01:49.539> Apple<00:01:49.960> is<00:01:49.990> kind<00:01:50.170> of

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
least one Apple this Apple is kind of

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.959 
least one Apple this Apple is kind of
big<00:01:50.500> so<00:01:50.710> I<00:01:50.740> think<00:01:50.860> I'm<00:01:51.100> just<00:01:51.280> gonna<00:01:51.399> use<00:01:51.700> half

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:51.969 
big so I think I'm just gonna use half

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.319 
big so I think I'm just gonna use half
the<00:01:52.679> reason<00:01:53.679> I<00:01:53.770> like<00:01:53.979> to<00:01:54.100> put<00:01:54.280> an<00:01:54.399> apple<00:01:54.610> in<00:01:54.909> my

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
the reason I like to put an apple in my

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.419 
the reason I like to put an apple in my
green<00:01:55.600> smoothie<00:01:56.110> is<00:01:56.320> because<00:01:56.829> it<00:01:56.979> adds<00:01:57.100> more

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:57.429 
green smoothie is because it adds more

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:00.149 
green smoothie is because it adds more
fiber<00:01:57.729> and<00:01:58.329> I<00:01:58.869> find<00:01:59.140> that<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.409> keeps<00:01:59.619> me<00:01:59.860> fuller

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
fiber and I find that it keeps me fuller

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.289 
fiber and I find that it keeps me fuller
longer<00:02:00.490> if<00:02:00.819> I<00:02:00.939> add<00:02:01.149> some<00:02:01.450> apple<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.700> one<00:02:03.970> you

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
longer if I add some apple so one you

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.899 
longer if I add some apple so one you
know<00:02:04.420> one<00:02:04.689> small<00:02:04.990> apple<00:02:05.829> or<00:02:06.009> maybe<00:02:06.189> half<00:02:06.549> of<00:02:06.789> a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
know one small apple or maybe half of a
