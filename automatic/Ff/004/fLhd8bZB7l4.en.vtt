doing a quick update on the cracky style
hydroponic<00:00:09.719> cucumber<00:00:10.590> plant<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.219> I've<00:00:11.340> been

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
hydroponic cucumber plant and I've been

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.620 
hydroponic cucumber plant and I've been
growing<00:00:11.790> since<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.480> end<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.809> June<00:00:14.450> just<00:00:15.450> gave

growing since the end of June just gave

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.230 
growing since the end of June just gave
the<00:00:15.900> plant<00:00:16.379> its<00:00:16.680> first<00:00:17.070> massive<00:00:17.550> haircut

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
the plant its first massive haircut

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.310 
the plant its first massive haircut
there<00:00:18.690> was<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:20.630> dropping<00:00:21.630> off<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.990> some<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
there was a dropping off of some of the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.670 
there was a dropping off of some of the
leaves<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:23.010> can<00:00:23.130> see<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> pile<00:00:23.609> there<00:00:24.680> over

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
leaves you can see the pile there over

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.890 
leaves you can see the pile there over
the<00:00:25.769> last<00:00:25.800> week<00:00:26.220> or<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.029> I<00:00:27.150> thought<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.660> I

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
the last week or so and I thought that I

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.250 
the last week or so and I thought that I
should<00:00:28.439> do<00:00:28.529> what<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.710> can<00:00:28.920> to<00:00:29.130> increase<00:00:29.279> airflow

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
should do what I can to increase airflow

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.380 
should do what I can to increase airflow
while<00:00:31.260> I<00:00:31.289> had<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> opportunity<00:00:32.390> it's

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
while I had the opportunity it's

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.630 
while I had the opportunity it's
beginning<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.809> show<00:00:34.050> some<00:00:34.739> signs<00:00:34.980> of<00:00:35.280> powdery

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
beginning to show some signs of powdery

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.040 
beginning to show some signs of powdery
mildew<00:00:36.620> but<00:00:37.620> honestly<00:00:38.610> I'm<00:00:39.030> not<00:00:39.660> too<00:00:39.870> terribly

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
mildew but honestly I'm not too terribly

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.510 
mildew but honestly I'm not too terribly
worried<00:00:40.530> about<00:00:40.710> it<00:00:40.890> at<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.129> point

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
worried about it at this point

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.360 
worried about it at this point
because<00:00:42.090> my<00:00:42.809> whole<00:00:43.079> goal<00:00:43.440> with<00:00:43.559> this<00:00:43.739> was<00:00:44.070> to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
because my whole goal with this was to

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.389 
because my whole goal with this was to
be<00:00:44.820> hands-off<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.170> most<00:00:46.320> parts<00:00:46.710> I've

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
be hands-off and for the most parts I've

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.880 
be hands-off and for the most parts I've
been<00:00:47.730> hands-off<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.510> it's<00:00:48.840> rewarded<00:00:49.410> me<00:00:49.590> with

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
been hands-off and it's rewarded me with

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.639 
been hands-off and it's rewarded me with
about<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.700> dozen<00:00:50.789> pickling<00:00:51.660> cucumbers<00:00:52.320> that

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
about a dozen pickling cucumbers that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.220 
about a dozen pickling cucumbers that
are<00:00:52.800> of<00:00:52.980> decent<00:00:53.520> size<00:00:53.789> I<00:00:54.239> actually<00:00:54.809> picked<00:00:55.170> a

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
are of decent size I actually picked a

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.819 
are of decent size I actually picked a
couple<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.649> were<00:00:55.739> smaller<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:57.030> week<00:00:57.829> so

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
couple that were smaller this week so

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.349 
couple that were smaller this week so
because<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.250> wanted<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.579> try<00:00:59.760> their<00:01:00.030> flavor

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
because I wanted to try their flavor

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.810 
because I wanted to try their flavor
versus<00:01:00.930> some<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.649> bigger<00:01:02.160> ones<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:04.820> erected

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
versus some of the bigger ones I erected

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.570 
versus some of the bigger ones I erected
a<00:01:06.240> trellis<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.650> out<00:01:07.860> of<00:01:07.920> an<00:01:08.130> old<00:01:08.250> potato

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
a trellis for it out of an old potato

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.350 
a trellis for it out of an old potato
chip<00:01:09.119> shelf<00:01:09.420> my<00:01:09.780> dad<00:01:09.990> gave<00:01:10.200> me<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.890> a<00:01:11.310> what<00:01:12.270> he

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
chip shelf my dad gave me and a what he

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.740 
chip shelf my dad gave me and a what he
used<00:01:12.510> to<00:01:12.600> be<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> tomato<00:01:13.229> trellis<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:15.000> it's

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
used to be a tomato trellis so it's

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.990 
used to be a tomato trellis so it's
helping<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.170> keep<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.530> tendrils<00:01:17.100> stressed

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
helping to keep the tendrils stressed

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.120 
helping to keep the tendrils stressed
from<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.840> looping<00:01:19.320> over<00:01:19.439> the<00:01:19.740> edge<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.070> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
from just looping over the edge of the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.030 
from just looping over the edge of the
bucket<00:01:20.520> which<00:01:21.150> was<00:01:21.299> causing<00:01:21.540> some<00:01:21.869> issues

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
bucket which was causing some issues

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.770 
bucket which was causing some issues
it's<00:01:23.040> also<00:01:23.189> helping<00:01:23.580> with<00:01:23.610> airflow<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.570> also

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
it's also helping with airflow it's also

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.350 
it's also helping with airflow it's also
helping<00:01:25.200> me<00:01:25.290> see<00:01:25.500> some<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.860> pickles<00:01:26.360> I've

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
helping me see some of the pickles I've

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.819 
helping me see some of the pickles I've
actually<00:01:27.540> reached<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.990> point<00:01:28.200> now<00:01:28.320> where<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
actually reached a point now where the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.830 
actually reached a point now where the
bucket<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.280> basically<00:01:29.909> out<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.270> water<00:01:30.450> again

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
bucket is basically out of water again

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.289 
bucket is basically out of water again
for<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.200> second<00:01:31.560> time<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.250> I'm<00:01:32.430> going<00:01:32.820> to<00:01:33.000> put

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
for the second time and I'm going to put

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.090 
for the second time and I'm going to put
it<00:01:33.390> in<00:01:33.479> another<00:01:33.570> round<00:01:34.020> of<00:01:34.140> nutrient<00:01:34.650> solution

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
it in another round of nutrient solution

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.490 
it in another round of nutrient solution
probably<00:01:35.520> only<00:01:35.640> fill<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:35.970> halfway<00:01:36.240> up<00:01:36.600> things

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
probably only fill it halfway up things

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.960 
probably only fill it halfway up things
are<00:01:37.619> being<00:01:37.710> kind<00:01:38.280> of<00:01:38.310> hotter<00:01:38.579> here<00:01:38.850> in

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
are being kind of hotter here in

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.370 
are being kind of hotter here in
Greensboro<00:01:39.229> in<00:01:40.229> mid-august

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
Greensboro in mid-august

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.560 
Greensboro in mid-august
reaching<00:01:43.380> into<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.159> 90s<00:01:44.579> yesterday<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
reaching into the 90s yesterday and

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.660 
reaching into the 90s yesterday and
today<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.920> definitely<00:01:47.340> stressed

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
today and it's it's definitely stressed

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.359 
today and it's it's definitely stressed
the<00:01:47.820> plant<00:01:48.740> one<00:01:49.740> of<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.920> things<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.250> I've

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
the plant one of the things that I've

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.859 
the plant one of the things that I've
learned<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.970> this<00:01:51.210> bucket

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
learned is this bucket

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.950 
learned is this bucket
it<00:01:52.110> gets<00:01:52.320> pretty<00:01:52.829> roasty<00:01:53.670> in<00:01:53.759> there<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.899> I

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
it gets pretty roasty in there so I

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.569 
it gets pretty roasty in there so I
doubt<00:01:55.200> that<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.560> roots<00:01:55.770> particularly<00:01:56.399> like

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
doubt that the roots particularly like

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.789 
doubt that the roots particularly like
the<00:01:56.759> hot<00:01:57.259> boiling<00:01:58.259> temperature<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.630> these

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
the hot boiling temperature that these

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.859 
the hot boiling temperature that these
the<00:02:01.799> Sun<00:02:02.009> produces<00:02:02.549> so<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.000> think<00:02:03.240> harder<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.750> do

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the Sun produces so I think harder to do

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.719 
the Sun produces so I think harder to do
this<00:02:03.960> again<00:02:04.350> I<00:02:04.590> definitely<00:02:05.280> would<00:02:05.399> need<00:02:05.490> some

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
this again I definitely would need some

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.639 
this again I definitely would need some
