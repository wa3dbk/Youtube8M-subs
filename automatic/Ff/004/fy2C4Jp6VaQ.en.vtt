milk and mixed it up my little blender
but<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.369> thing<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.700> I<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.659> think<00:01:33.869> care<00:01:34.079> for

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
but the thing is I just think care for

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.580 
but the thing is I just think care for
it<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.310> added<00:01:36.049> banana<00:01:37.049> in<00:01:37.320> there

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
it and and so I added banana in there

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.670 
it and and so I added banana in there
and<00:01:37.890> then<00:01:38.100> also<00:01:38.400> I<00:01:38.700> added<00:01:39.200> another<00:01:40.200> two<00:01:40.409> ounces

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
and then also I added another two ounces

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.389 
and then also I added another two ounces
of<00:01:40.920> water<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.689> I<00:01:42.689> put<00:01:42.869> some<00:01:42.899> blueberries<00:01:43.890> and

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
of water and I put some blueberries and

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.789 
of water and I put some blueberries and
some<00:01:44.790> ice<00:01:44.939> cubes<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.689> was<00:01:45.840> okay<00:01:46.140> so<00:01:46.320> you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
some ice cubes and it was okay so you

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.539 
some ice cubes and it was okay so you
have<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:46.979> add<00:01:47.159> a<00:01:47.189> lot<00:01:47.430> of<00:01:47.579> junk<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:49.549> tape

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
have to add a lot of junk to it to tape

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.370 
have to add a lot of junk to it to tape
it<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:50.909> wasn't<00:01:51.090> horrible<00:01:51.450> I've<00:01:51.689> had<00:01:51.840> worse

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
it and wasn't horrible I've had worse

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.039 
it and wasn't horrible I've had worse
I<00:01:52.409> think<00:01:53.100> muscle<00:01:53.250> milk<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:53.700> much<00:01:53.909> worse<00:01:54.119> but<00:01:55.020> I

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
I think muscle milk is much worse but I

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.600 
I think muscle milk is much worse but I
would<00:01:55.320> not<00:01:55.470> be<00:01:55.590> spend<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:55.920> coming<00:01:56.250> on<00:01:56.399> this

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
would not be spend that coming on this

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.880 
would not be spend that coming on this
and<00:01:56.850> that<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.810> my<00:01:58.350> product<00:01:58.920> review<00:01:59.280> for
