people do but for apexis I'm going to be

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.180 
people do but for apexis I'm going to be
cutting<00:00:43.269> some<00:00:43.390> forms<00:00:43.840> out<00:00:44.050> of<00:00:44.079> plywood<00:00:44.440> and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
cutting some forms out of plywood and

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.549 
cutting some forms out of plywood and
then<00:00:45.610> Rao<00:00:45.879> during<00:00:46.210> the<00:00:46.300> edges<00:00:46.660> and<00:00:46.960> then<00:00:47.350> doing

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
then Rao during the edges and then doing

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:49.829 
then Rao during the edges and then doing
some<00:00:47.800> things<00:00:48.010> to<00:00:48.220> make<00:00:48.370> it<00:00:48.550> you<00:00:49.449> know<00:00:49.540> look

some things to make it you know look

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:51.540 
some things to make it you know look
three-dimensional<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:51.010> give<00:00:51.159> it<00:00:51.280> a<00:00:51.339> real

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
three-dimensional and give it a real

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.860 
three-dimensional and give it a real
corner<00:00:52.480> apex<00:00:52.960> look<00:00:53.199> so<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:55.449> this<00:00:55.570> I'm<00:00:55.780> going

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:55.870 
corner apex look so for this I'm going

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.240 
corner apex look so for this I'm going
to<00:00:55.960> be<00:00:56.019> doing<00:00:56.260> for<00:00:56.650> the<00:00:56.680> end<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:56.980> a<00:00:57.040> long

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:57.250 
to be doing for the end of a long

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.369 
to be doing for the end of a long
straight<00:00:57.640> it's<00:00:58.570> just<00:00:58.720> going<00:00:58.839> to<00:00:58.899> be<00:00:59.019> rounded

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
straight it's just going to be rounded

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.500 
straight it's just going to be rounded
on<00:00:59.470> the<00:00:59.500> end<00:00:59.739> and<00:00:59.890> then<00:01:00.010> cut<00:01:00.250> fairly<00:01:01.000> short<00:01:01.390> so

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
on the end and then cut fairly short so

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.450 
on the end and then cut fairly short so
I'm<00:01:01.809> just<00:01:01.930> gonna<00:01:02.079> have<00:01:02.769> already<00:01:03.100> drawn<00:01:03.309> my

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
I'm just gonna have already drawn my

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.940 
I'm just gonna have already drawn my
shapes<00:01:03.730> on<00:01:03.969> here<00:01:04.330> I'm<00:01:05.320> going<00:01:05.470> to<00:01:05.530> just<00:01:05.680> take<00:01:05.890> a

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
shapes on here I'm going to just take a

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:31.370 
shapes on here I'm going to just take a
jigsaw<00:01:06.759> and<00:01:06.789> cut<00:01:07.060> these<00:01:07.180> out<00:01:07.390> real<00:01:07.570> quick

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.290 

the<00:01:32.380> basic<00:01:32.770> soup<00:01:33.040> and<00:01:33.610> then<00:01:33.700> I<00:01:33.850> rather<00:01:34.090> the

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
the basic soup and then I rather the

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.250 
the basic soup and then I rather the
edge

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.590 

and<00:01:41.260> there<00:01:41.710> you<00:01:41.799> have<00:01:41.979> the<00:01:42.520> basic<00:01:42.850> shape<00:01:43.060> looks

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
and there you have the basic shape looks

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.020 
and there you have the basic shape looks
nice<00:01:43.810> with<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.080> rounded<00:01:44.440> edge<00:01:44.760> and<00:01:45.760> we'll

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
nice with the rounded edge and we'll

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.780 
nice with the rounded edge and we'll
move<00:01:46.150> on<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:50.350> the<00:01:50.470> next<00:01:50.650> step<00:01:50.830> on<00:01:50.950> my<00:01:51.130> scaled

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
move on so the next step on my scaled

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.520 
move on so the next step on my scaled
drift<00:01:52.000> track<00:01:52.270> here<00:01:52.540> is<00:01:53.460> installing<00:01:54.460> these

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
drift track here is installing these

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.420 
drift track here is installing these
these<00:01:56.530> are<00:01:56.680> hobbyking<00:01:57.960> they<00:01:58.960> have<00:01:59.110> this<00:01:59.430> set

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
these are hobbyking they have this set

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.130 
these are hobbyking they have this set
that<00:02:00.460> they<00:02:00.670> sell<00:02:00.909> ordered<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.479> buttload<00:02:02.080> of

these things I've just taken a I've cut
my<00:02:06.009> kind<00:02:06.940> of<00:02:07.000> infilled<00:02:07.420> slash<00:02:08.110> apex<00:02:08.649> of<00:02:09.100> the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
my kind of infilled slash apex of the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.070 
my kind of infilled slash apex of the
track<00:02:10.209> out<00:02:10.780> of<00:02:11.470> 5/8<00:02:11.800> supply<00:02:12.959> routered<00:02:13.959> the

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
track out of 5/8 supply routered the

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.080 
track out of 5/8 supply routered the
edge<00:02:14.230> this<00:02:14.860> will<00:02:15.040> eventually<00:02:15.220> get<00:02:15.670> painted

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
edge this will eventually get painted

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.960 
edge this will eventually get painted
green<00:02:16.360> and<00:02:17.290> then<00:02:17.470> we'll<00:02:17.650> do<00:02:17.800> the<00:02:17.980> red<00:02:18.850> and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
green and then we'll do the red and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.420 
green and then we'll do the red and
white<00:02:19.090> checkers<00:02:19.480> on<00:02:19.630> the<00:02:19.720> outside<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:21.040> then

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
white checkers on the outside and then

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.660 
white checkers on the outside and then
I'm<00:02:22.180> going<00:02:22.360> to<00:02:22.390> mount<00:02:22.660> these<00:02:23.610> guardrails<00:02:24.610> here

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
I'm going to mount these guardrails here

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.910 
I'm going to mount these guardrails here
hoping<00:02:27.670> that<00:02:27.730> they<00:02:28.000> will<00:02:28.380> then<00:02:29.380> I'll<00:02:29.680> be<00:02:29.860> able

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
hoping that they will then I'll be able

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.610 
hoping that they will then I'll be able
to<00:02:30.070> get<00:02:30.250> them<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.400> go<00:02:31.080> all<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.290> way<00:02:32.320> around

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
to get them to go all the way around

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:33.780 
to get them to go all the way around
this<00:02:32.739> thing<00:02:32.800> and<00:02:33.190> kind<00:02:33.310> of<00:02:33.430> have<00:02:33.519> a<00:02:33.550> nice

this thing and kind of have a nice

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.170 
this thing and kind of have a nice
looking<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:36.100> know<00:02:36.190> pair<00:02:36.580> pin<00:02:36.760> at<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:36.910> end<00:02:37.090> of

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
looking you know pair pin at the end of

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.229 
looking you know pair pin at the end of
a<00:02:37.239> corner<00:02:37.600> so<00:02:37.780> we'll<00:02:38.080> see<00:02:38.200> how<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.350> turns<00:02:38.500> out

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
a corner so we'll see how it turns out

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:44.819 
a corner so we'll see how it turns out
another<00:02:40.239> one<00:02:40.480> using<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.830> green<00:02:42.430> vinyl<00:02:42.880> to<00:02:43.829> the

another one using the green vinyl to the

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:49.560 
another one using the green vinyl to the
grass<00:02:45.549> section<00:02:46.200> and<00:02:47.200> then<00:02:48.239> when<00:02:49.239> I'm<00:02:49.329> ready<00:02:49.480> to

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
grass section and then when I'm ready to

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:52.039 
grass section and then when I'm ready to
do<00:02:49.630> the<00:02:49.750> checkerboard<00:02:50.079> I'm<00:02:50.410> just<00:02:50.590> using<00:02:50.739> some

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
do the checkerboard I'm just using some

3m safety tape I'm actually just cutting
it<00:02:55.840> each<00:02:56.310> square<00:02:57.310> individually<00:02:57.820> and<00:02:58.060> then

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
it each square individually and then

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.690 
it each square individually and then
stick<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.780> on<00:02:58.870> there<00:02:59.250> and<00:03:00.250> when<00:03:00.400> I'm<00:03:00.489> done<00:03:00.640> I

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:26.380 

pretty<00:03:05.780> convincing<00:03:06.079> look<00:03:06.439> I<00:03:06.590> think<00:03:10.750> that<00:03:25.390> you

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
pretty convincing look I think that you

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.729 
pretty convincing look I think that you
get<00:03:26.450> a<00:03:26.540> nice<00:03:27.099> finished<00:03:28.099> looking<00:03:28.400> curve<00:03:29.739> and

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
get a nice finished looking curve and

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.869 
get a nice finished looking curve and
there's<00:03:31.459> what<00:03:31.760> it<00:03:31.849> looks<00:03:32.030> like<00:03:32.209> with<00:03:32.480> the

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:33.879 
there's what it looks like with the

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.890 
there's what it looks like with the
railing<00:03:34.879> installed<00:03:35.299> I<00:03:37.480> gonna<00:03:38.480> be<00:03:38.569> taking<00:03:38.840> this
