 and we have this year 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.300
 Christmas concert technically accompanied 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.919
 and in this video you will learn what we are 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.669
 have considered us and how we do this 

00:00:16.919 --> 00:00:19.669
 everything built 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.730

 O 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:20.650
 [Music] 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:23.049
 the first consideration was 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:25.710
 On the one hand we have a choir and 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.390
 orchestra illuminated from the front 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.670
 On the other hand, we also have your notes 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.770
 light 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.300
 besides, we have a pleasant one 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.960
 mood 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.200
 placed in the whole church leds 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:45.509
 and a system built around solos 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.509
 and accepting speeches 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.950
 At the back she wants to die 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.920
 pa 64 10 millimeter leds built the 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.160
 as flores up against ivan 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:05.050
 bright on the front are left 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:07.990
 and on the right three stable 36 x 3 each 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.220
 watt led s that is the 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:15.090
 bigger brother of the ten millimeter leds 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.240
 behind the altar are again 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:22.480
 14 millimeters of leds and also the 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:25.740
 altar of a strength 36 x 3 watt led 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.960
 illuminated from below 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.690
 for the lighting of the choir and the 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.200
 orchestra we have here at the pillars 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:38.860
 two times five meters traverses 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:45.430
 placed at these very high up 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:53.190
 2 and 650 lamps left and right respectively 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:56.650
 and below on a subject 456 know 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:01.000
 which are attached to a room and 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:03.190
 that is a topic of buhl tax in front 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.880
 then we have left and right 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:12.700
 two millennium non-tripods at this 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:15.760
 There are four pairs of 56 around each 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:18.700
 lights for lighting 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.890
 that means from munich in the notes 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:23.830
 illuminate and the lamps at the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:27.120
 Travers are meant for the faces 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.120
 to light from the front 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.800
 true here on the empore from there 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.230
 let's just control the whole of the light 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:39.520
 we control the ixs with the stamp 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.180
 invader 24 20 we control everything via dmx 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.090
 on 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:46.090
 except the led which illuminates everyday life 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.050
 this is in stand alone mode 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.459
 set orange with the leds i have 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:53.340
 already told you can the 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:56.530
 create different moods 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.660
 eg this mood and this mood 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:02.190
 we would already use a concert 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.310
 pleasant mood with orange and purple 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.900
 Yes, but others can 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:11.709
 disturbances like here a bit 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.440
 big with this led green and blue 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.829
 It looks really cool here 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.919
 and explain the parking we put 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:23.440
 Of course , over the desk 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.550
 you do not see it here at all 

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:26.550
 lighting from the front 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.450
 and here you can see the notes lighting 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.940
 the lamps are always in two groups 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:41.280
 split office always so there is one 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:44.860
 room for these eight lamps in front and 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:48.370
 like it is here we have a 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:53.470
 channel for the almost ries and then 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:57.280
 two pairs each know about the two 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.840
 electro ssx 300 boxes and the 2d five 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.520
 to control microphones 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:08.590
 here we use the live mix reeser 16 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:12.400
 2 and the microphones develop and have 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.410
 We next turn our sidetrack you see 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:17.650
 once here the radio receiver of the 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.510
 first five that's a funk micro 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.479
 other micros just a wired one 

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:25.630
 micro and still to see are a trip 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:28.840
 a compressor a frequency divider and 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:33.689
 an amplifier that sees me here 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.969
 it's the 32 amp power distributor 

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:39.209
 because he is the conventional light 

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:42.059
 still needs a lot of electricity and so on 

00:05:39.209 --> 00:05:42.959
 we just have more phases here and 

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:46.669
 possibilities 

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:46.669
 to supply the whole with electricity 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.810
 [Music] 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:04.190
 So that was this year's 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.710
 video for the christmas concert at this 

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:09.050
 imagine I thank even my cameraman

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:16.190

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:20.870
 other videos and our mixer to 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.030
 Exactly this is here and there 

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:27.560
 video for lighting in theaters 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:30.950
 lecture directly in our legs 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:34.810
 every case before christmas good slip 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.810
