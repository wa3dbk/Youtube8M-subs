to use the salt pork you have to soak it

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.500 
to use the salt pork you have to soak it
you<00:00:37.110> have<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.350> take<00:00:37.739> several<00:00:37.980> hours<00:00:38.360> soak<00:00:39.360> it

you have to take several hours soak it
in<00:00:39.630> water<00:00:39.870> change<00:00:40.560> the<00:00:40.770> water<00:00:40.980> out<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.520> soaked

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
in water change the water out I soaked

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.810 
in water change the water out I soaked
it<00:00:42.000> again<00:00:42.420> until<00:00:42.720> it's<00:00:43.560> ready<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.400> use<00:00:44.640> if

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
it again until it's ready to to use if

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.640 
it again until it's ready to to use if
you<00:00:44.940> don't<00:00:45.150> soak<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.780> several<00:00:46.079> times<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.560> get

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
all the salt out it's inedible so the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.120 
all the salt out it's inedible so the
big<00:00:51.360> difference<00:00:51.810> between<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:52.380> soup<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:52.950> a<00:00:53.070> stew

is<00:00:53.460> how<00:00:53.579> much<00:00:53.760> water<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.180> use<00:00:54.210> when<00:00:54.540> we<00:00:54.660> prepare

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
is how much water we use when we prepare

it and the first thing we have to do is
to<00:00:57.030> get<00:00:57.120> this<00:00:57.300> water<00:00:57.510> going<00:00:58.020> get<00:00:58.290> it<00:00:58.380> boiling

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
to get this water going get it boiling

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.430

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
bit of fat I'm gonna let this set and

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.200 
bit of fat I'm gonna let this set and
fear<00:01:24.110> a<00:01:24.260> little<00:01:24.530> bit<00:01:24.850> browning<00:01:25.850> this<00:01:25.970> meat

fear a little bit browning this meat

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.680 
fear a little bit browning this meat
first<00:01:26.510> will<00:01:26.810> release<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.380> lot<00:01:27.800> of<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.070> flavors

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
get it to caramelize properly that

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.390 
get it to caramelize properly that
releases<00:01:36.080> too<00:01:36.229> many<00:01:36.410> juices<00:01:39.220> once<00:01:40.220> your
