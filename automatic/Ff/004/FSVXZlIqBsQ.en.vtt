most<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:15.780> its<00:00:15.960> collagen<00:00:16.650> protein<00:00:17.250> and

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
most in its collagen protein and

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.840 
most in its collagen protein and
collagen<00:00:18.300> protein<00:00:19.260> is<00:00:20.039> actually<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.490> amino

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
collagen protein is actually the amino

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.790 
collagen protein is actually the amino
acids<00:00:21.539> that<00:00:21.660> you<00:00:21.779> would<00:00:21.900> find<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.439> something

so it's used in a lot of skin products
collagen<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.910> last<00:01:03.449> but<00:01:03.690> not<00:01:03.809> least

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
collagen is and last but not least

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.929 
collagen is and last but not least

collagen is also used to support a
healthy<00:01:06.240> metabolism<00:01:06.680> for<00:01:07.680> things<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.090> fat

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
healthy metabolism for things like fat

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.969 
healthy metabolism for things like fat
burning<00:01:09.540> weight<00:01:09.750> loss<00:01:10.020> overall<00:01:10.650> even

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
burning weight loss overall even

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.920 
burning weight loss overall even
building<00:01:11.310> muscle<00:01:11.760> but<00:01:12.270> collagen<00:01:12.810> is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
building muscle but collagen is

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.960 
building muscle but collagen is
important<00:01:13.380> for<00:01:13.470> really<00:01:13.710> all<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:14.340> those<00:01:14.520> things

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
important for really all of those things

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.510 
important for really all of those things
and<00:01:15.330> so<00:01:16.049> what<00:01:16.320> collagen<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.920> again<00:01:17.159> its<00:01:17.280> amino

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
and so what collagen is again its amino

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.219 
and so what collagen is again its amino
acids<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.210> amino<00:01:18.270> acids<00:01:18.960> are<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.080> building

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
acids and amino acids are the building

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.399 
acids and amino acids are the building
blocks<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.250> protein<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.689> number<00:01:22.110> one<00:01:22.290> if

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
blocks of protein and so number one if

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.630 
blocks of protein and so number one if
you<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.680> trying<00:01:23.009> to<00:01:23.100> increase<00:01:23.400> your

a<00:03:41.940> net<00:03:42.240> and<00:03:42.390> you<00:03:42.510> can<00:03:42.660> get<00:03:42.780> holes<00:03:43.080> in<00:03:43.290> your<00:03:43.380> gut

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
a net and you can get holes in your gut

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.410 
a net and you can get holes in your gut
gluten<00:03:44.550> can<00:03:44.700> leak<00:03:44.910> through<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:45.300> that's

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
gluten can leak through and that's

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.820 
gluten can leak through and that's
essentially<00:03:45.840> what<00:03:45.870> leaky<00:03:46.290> gut<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.500> or

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
essentially what leaky gut is or

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.710 
essentially what leaky gut is or
digestive<00:03:47.370> issues<00:03:47.730> it's<00:03:48.150> when<00:03:48.330> things<00:03:48.510> like

muscle tissue this is a great thing to
do<00:04:45.420> in<00:04:45.510> fact<00:04:45.690> just<00:04:45.870> one<00:04:46.110> tablespoon<00:04:46.650> of

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
do in fact just one tablespoon of

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.400 
do in fact just one tablespoon of
collagen<00:04:47.400> powder<00:04:47.640> has<00:04:48.180> about<00:04:48.450> seven<00:04:48.930> grams<00:04:49.230> of

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410 
collagen powder has about seven grams of

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:50.630 
collagen powder has about seven grams of
protein<00:04:49.860> so<00:04:49.890> you<00:04:50.010> can<00:04:50.160> do<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.280> couple

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:50.640 
protein so you can do a couple

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:52.880 
protein so you can do a couple
tablespoons<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.810> collagen<00:04:52.320> powder<00:04:52.530> in<00:04:52.830> your

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
tablespoons of collagen powder in your

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.280 
tablespoons of collagen powder in your
more<00:04:53.490> than<00:04:53.700> smoothie<00:04:54.210> and<00:04:54.270> get<00:04:54.420> about<00:04:54.600> 15

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
more than smoothie and get about 15

grams<00:04:55.770> of<00:04:56.210> easily<00:04:57.210> digestible<00:04:58.200> protein<00:04:58.440> and

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
grams of easily digestible protein and

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.950 
grams of easily digestible protein and
so<00:04:59.490> this<00:04:59.640> is<00:04:59.760> something<00:05:00.030> a<00:05:00.090> lot<00:05:00.300> more<00:05:00.360> people

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
I found a great source of grass-fed

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.880 
I found a great source of grass-fed
collagen<00:05:36.660> that<00:05:36.810> doesn't<00:05:37.140> use<00:05:37.230> any<00:05:37.500> sort<00:05:37.770> of

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
collagen that doesn't use any sort of

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:39.890 
collagen that doesn't use any sort of
hormones<00:05:38.340> and<00:05:38.490> chemicals<00:05:38.580> it's<00:05:39.210> completely

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
hormones and chemicals it's completely

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:42.560 
hormones and chemicals it's completely
natural<00:05:40.190> it's<00:05:41.190> also<00:05:41.400> grass-fed<00:05:42.120> and<00:05:42.300> so<00:05:42.390> this

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:42.570 
natural it's also grass-fed and so this

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.910 
natural it's also grass-fed and so this
is<00:05:42.720> collagen<00:05:43.230> powder<00:05:43.350> that<00:05:43.560> comes<00:05:43.710> from

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
is collagen powder that comes from

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.450 
is collagen powder that comes from
grass-fed<00:05:44.550> cows<00:05:44.820> from<00:05:45.480> Argentina<00:05:46.220> and<00:05:47.220> so

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:47.460 
grass-fed cows from Argentina and so

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.770 
grass-fed cows from Argentina and so

00:05:59.660 --> 00:05:59.670 
mentioned in terms of helping support

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:02.930 
mentioned in terms of helping support
your<00:05:59.790> your<00:06:00.180> skin<00:06:00.660> your<00:06:01.440> joints<00:06:02.070> your<00:06:02.370> gut<00:06:02.730> as

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
is a great dairy-free and gluten-free

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:08.930 
is a great dairy-free and gluten-free
option<00:06:07.410> for<00:06:07.590> increasing<00:06:08.040> your<00:06:08.160> amino<00:06:08.370> acids

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 
option for increasing your amino acids

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:10.700 
option for increasing your amino acids
in<00:06:09.060> protein<00:06:09.540> and<00:06:09.720> here's<00:06:10.140> the<00:06:10.290> other<00:06:10.320> unique

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
in protein and here's the other unique

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.490 
in protein and here's the other unique
thing<00:06:10.770> is<00:06:11.220> that<00:06:11.430> it's<00:06:12.240> not<00:06:12.360> protein<00:06:13.080> its<00:06:13.230> amino

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
thing is that it's not protein its amino

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:15.200 
thing is that it's not protein its amino
acids<00:06:14.130> which<00:06:14.250> are<00:06:14.340> the<00:06:14.400> building<00:06:14.490> blocks<00:06:15.060> of

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
acids which are the building blocks of

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:16.940 
acids which are the building blocks of
protein<00:06:15.540> so<00:06:15.690> it's<00:06:15.810> pre<00:06:16.110> digested<00:06:16.710> protein

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:16.950 
protein so it's pre digested protein

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:20.390 
protein so it's pre digested protein
which<00:06:17.670> is<00:06:17.850> why<00:06:18.120> it's<00:06:18.360> so<00:06:18.750> easy<00:06:19.080> to<00:06:19.470> digest<00:06:19.800> and

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
which is why it's so easy to digest and

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.520 
which is why it's so easy to digest and
so<00:06:20.790> again<00:06:21.030> I<00:06:21.060> recommend<00:06:21.270> two<00:06:21.870> tablespoons

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:22.530 
so again I recommend two tablespoons

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:25.760 
so again I recommend two tablespoons
