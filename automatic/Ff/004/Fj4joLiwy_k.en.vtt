00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:23.170 
about these guys so this is the only

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.970 
about these guys so this is the only
unit<00:00:23.740> that<00:00:23.770> was<00:00:24.100> dropped<00:00:24.460> from<00:00:25.290> the<00:00:26.290> old<00:00:26.470> codex

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
unit that was dropped from the old codex

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.429 
unit that was dropped from the old codex
when<00:00:27.220> we<00:00:27.310> went<00:00:27.460> into<00:00:27.580> the<00:00:27.760> new<00:00:27.940> codex<00:00:28.450> and<00:00:29.260> they

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:29.439 
when we went into the new codex and they

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.030 
when we went into the new codex and they
were<00:00:29.500> dropped<00:00:30.090> an<00:00:31.090> almost<00:00:31.960> sort<00:00:32.290> of<00:00:32.500> replaced

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
were dropped an almost sort of replaced

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.850 
were dropped an almost sort of replaced
so<00:00:33.550> you've<00:00:33.790> got<00:00:33.850> Praetorians<00:00:34.660> now<00:00:34.960> and<00:00:35.260> light

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
so you've got Praetorians now and light

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.920 
so you've got Praetorians now and light
guard<00:00:36.280> which<00:00:37.320> sort<00:00:38.320> of<00:00:38.440> replaces<00:00:39.430> them

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
guard which sort of replaces them

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.110 
guard which sort of replaces them
basically<00:00:40.930> i<00:00:41.079> assume<00:00:41.770> is<00:00:41.920> just<00:00:42.160> the<00:00:42.579> fluff

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
basically i assume is just the fluff

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.030 
basically i assume is just the fluff
wise<00:00:43.390> which<00:00:43.660> is<00:00:43.780> why<00:00:43.900> they<00:00:44.079> went<00:00:44.590> away<00:00:44.710> from

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.040 
wise which is why they went away from

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.670 
wise which is why they went away from
these<00:00:45.160> guys<00:00:45.220> but<00:00:45.900> from<00:00:46.900> a<00:00:46.930> modeling<00:00:47.200> point<00:00:47.530> of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
these guys but from a modeling point of

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.229 
these guys but from a modeling point of
view<00:00:47.859> these<00:00:48.219> were<00:00:48.489> actually<00:00:48.969> one<00:00:49.120> of<00:00:49.149> my

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 
view these were actually one of my

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.330 
view these were actually one of my
favorite<00:00:49.329> minis<00:00:50.170> from<00:00:50.379> the<00:00:50.469> old<00:00:50.620> codex<00:00:51.129> and

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
favorite minis from the old codex and

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.069 
favorite minis from the old codex and
it's<00:00:51.910> a<00:00:51.940> real<00:00:52.120> shame<00:00:52.329> actually<00:00:52.750> that<00:00:52.930> the

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
it's a real shame actually that the

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.200 
it's a real shame actually that the
units<00:00:53.440> not<00:00:53.710> in<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.100> near<00:00:54.250> codex<00:00:54.760> to<00:00:54.910> be<00:00:55.000> honest

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:55.210 
units not in the near codex to be honest

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.290 
units not in the near codex to be honest
because<00:00:55.420> I<00:00:55.719> actually<00:00:55.899> quite<00:00:56.170> like<00:00:56.230> these<00:00:56.590> guys

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
because I actually quite like these guys

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.250 
because I actually quite like these guys
but<00:00:58.300> the<00:00:58.359> reason<00:00:58.510> why<00:00:58.690> I<00:00:58.750> pulled<00:00:58.960> these<00:00:59.079> out

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
but the reason why I pulled these out

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.360 
but the reason why I pulled these out
I'm<00:00:59.469> going<00:00:59.590> to<00:00:59.649> have<00:00:59.769> a<00:00:59.829> quick<00:00:59.949> chat<00:01:00.039> about

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
I'm going to have a quick chat about

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.700 
I'm going to have a quick chat about
them<00:01:00.940> because<00:01:01.300> okay<00:01:02.019> they're<00:01:02.199> not<00:01:02.350> in<00:01:02.500> the<00:01:02.590> new

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710 
them because okay they're not in the new

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.410 
them because okay they're not in the new
codex<00:01:03.129> but<00:01:03.370> that<00:01:03.550> does<00:01:03.760> not<00:01:03.789> mean<00:01:04.180> that<00:01:04.239> we

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
codex but that does not mean that we

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.500 
codex but that does not mean that we
can't<00:01:04.660> use<00:01:05.019> them<00:01:05.320> so<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.730> way<00:01:06.850> i'm<00:01:07.060> using<00:01:07.480> my

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
can't use them so the way i'm using my

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.250 
can't use them so the way i'm using my
priors<00:01:08.050> is<00:01:08.440> on<00:01:09.040> finding<00:01:09.400> they<00:01:09.460> make<00:01:09.640> fantastic

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260

and<00:02:02.590> I<00:02:02.710> you<00:02:02.950> know<00:02:03.100> it's<00:02:03.250> not<00:02:03.399> an<00:02:03.640> issues<00:02:04.000> not<00:02:04.180> a

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
and I you know it's not an issues not a

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.370 
and I you know it's not an issues not a
problem<00:02:04.630> so<00:02:05.590> it's<00:02:05.890> worth<00:02:06.070> considering<00:02:07.320> how<00:02:08.320> do

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
problem so it's worth considering how do

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.230 
problem so it's worth considering how do
you<00:02:08.740> know<00:02:08.860> what<00:02:09.220> you<00:02:09.340> can<00:02:09.460> do<00:02:09.610> basically<00:02:10.030> if

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
you know what you can do basically if

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.940 
you know what you can do basically if
you've<00:02:10.330> got<00:02:10.539> these<00:02:10.720> models<00:02:11.170> then<00:02:11.530> doesn't

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
you've got these models then doesn't

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.710 
you've got these models then doesn't
mean<00:02:12.040> you<00:02:12.100> can't<00:02:12.250> use<00:02:12.460> them<00:02:12.670> it<00:02:13.270> could<00:02:13.420> be<00:02:13.540> good

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
mean you can't use them it could be good

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.530 
mean you can't use them it could be good
converting<00:02:14.470> opportunity<00:02:15.370> maybe<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.240> want<00:02:16.420> to

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
converting opportunity maybe you want to

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.760 
converting opportunity maybe you want to
compare<00:02:16.720> them<00:02:16.960> up<00:02:17.080> I<00:02:17.230> mean<00:02:17.350> I<00:02:17.410> personally

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
compare them up I mean I personally

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.130 
compare them up I mean I personally
wouldn't<00:02:18.190> do<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:18.370> because<00:02:18.760> for<00:02:19.150> me<00:02:19.750> this<00:02:19.990> is

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
wouldn't do that because for me this is

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.190 
wouldn't do that because for me this is
