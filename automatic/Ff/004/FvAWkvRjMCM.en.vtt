slurs<00:00:00.510> can<00:00:00.810> also<00:00:01.020> be<00:00:01.410> added<00:00:01.650> to<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.520> cascade<00:00:03.179> to

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
slurs can also be added to a cascade to

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.210 
slurs can also be added to a cascade to
extend<00:00:04.110> it<00:00:04.350> or<00:00:04.529> add<00:00:05.359> additional<00:00:06.410> interest<00:00:07.410> I'm

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
extend it or add additional interest I'm

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.499 
extend it or add additional interest I'm
holding<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:09.300> bar<00:00:09.780> at<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:11.099> 7th<00:00:11.490> fret<00:00:11.820> on<00:00:12.059> my<00:00:12.269> left

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
holding a bar at the 7th fret on my left

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.740 
holding a bar at the 7th fret on my left
hand<00:00:12.780> barring<00:00:13.200> four<00:00:13.530> strings<00:00:14.040> and<00:00:14.750> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
hand barring four strings and the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:23.929 
hand barring four strings and the
Cascade<00:00:16.289> normally<00:00:16.949> would<00:00:17.130> be<00:00:21.439> right<00:00:22.439> so<00:00:22.939> what

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
Cascade normally would be right so what

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.980 
Cascade normally would be right so what
we<00:00:24.029> can<00:00:24.150> do<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.779> can<00:00:24.810> add<00:00:25.170> a<00:00:25.199> hammer<00:00:25.920> on<00:00:26.840> here<00:00:27.840> at

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
we can do we can add a hammer on here at

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.519 
we can do we can add a hammer on here at
the<00:00:28.140> top<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.010> Cascade<00:00:30.199> onto<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.320> first

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
the top of the Cascade onto the first

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.470 
the top of the Cascade onto the first
string<00:00:32.040> hammering<00:00:32.730> on<00:00:32.820> to<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> first<00:00:33.270> string

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
string hammering on to the first string

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:44.119 
string hammering on to the first string
of<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> ninth<00:00:33.930> fret<00:00:35.899> looks<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.079> this<00:00:43.129> and

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
of the ninth fret looks like this and

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:51.250 
of the ninth fret looks like this and
just<00:00:44.550> leave<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.000> down<00:00:45.270> once<00:00:45.840> I've<00:00:46.020> hammered<00:00:46.440> on

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.650 

we<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.440> also<00:00:52.649> add<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> pull<00:00:53.760> off<00:00:54.000> along<00:00:54.629> with

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
we can also add a pull off along with

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.660 
we can also add a pull off along with
the<00:00:54.930> hammer<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.829> we<00:00:55.980> start<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> Cascade

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
the hammer so we start the Cascade

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.660 
the hammer so we start the Cascade
hammer

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670

hit<00:01:01.269> the<00:01:01.420> third<00:01:01.690> string<00:01:02.519> harmonic<00:01:03.519> as<00:01:03.730> normal

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
hit the third string harmonic as normal

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:17.090 
hit the third string harmonic as normal
and<00:01:04.869> then<00:01:05.560> pull<00:01:06.460> off<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:09.159> little<00:01:09.399> finger

that<00:01:18.100> sounds<00:01:18.580> like<00:01:25.979> or<00:01:26.979> I<00:01:27.240> can<00:01:28.240> do<00:01:28.330> the<00:01:28.450> hammer

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 
that sounds like or I can do the hammer

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.690 
that sounds like or I can do the hammer
ons<00:01:28.930> plus<00:01:29.380> extra<00:01:29.860> pull<00:01:30.070> offs<00:01:30.250> with<00:01:30.430> a<00:01:30.460> little

string pull off on the first string hit

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.550 
string pull off on the first string hit
the<00:01:41.320> fourth<00:01:41.950> string<00:01:42.369> harmonic<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.509> then<00:01:44.140> pull

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
the fourth string harmonic and then pull

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.100 
the fourth string harmonic and then pull
off<00:01:44.830> on<00:01:45.220> the<00:01:45.340> second<00:01:45.820> string<00:01:46.150> and<00:01:46.570> this<00:01:46.900> gets

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
off on the second string and this gets

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.230 
off on the second string and this gets
me<00:01:47.259> going<00:01:47.409> from<00:01:47.619> G<00:01:48.220> sharp<00:01:48.520> at<00:01:48.729> the<00:01:48.759> ninth<00:01:49.030> fret

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
me going from G sharp at the ninth fret

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.920 
me going from G sharp at the ninth fret
pulling<00:01:49.750> off<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:50.200> my<00:01:50.320> bar<00:01:51.270> and<00:01:52.270> then<00:01:52.390> continue

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:52.930 
pulling off to my bar and then continue

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:59.130 
pulling off to my bar and then continue
on<00:01:52.960> down<00:01:53.410> like<00:01:54.039> that<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:56.229> sounds<00:01:56.800> like<00:01:56.860> this
