00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.430
 nothing 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:15.670
 if you want here the minecraft video the 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:18.160
 1819 tv I do not even know what it is but 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.840
 have uploaded three new images good is 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:21.369
 that just that I wanted to talk to you 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.779
 before starting the video you always 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.880
 they put me the comments that they already took 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.259
 the new image that goes up and so but so 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.410
 how I had made some videos in the 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.910
 that you want everything that came out and then you 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.270
 I said everything that will come out 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.520
 correctly what has been 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.930
 true then that's why I decided not to do 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.640
 a video every time an image comes out 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.030
 because if I had not crammed the channel 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.640
 and it is a video would trash 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.129
 so I decide to make this a video 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.719
 when three images come out four 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:51.489
 images and already together all in one 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.829
 same video and we talk about them ok 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.199
 so we started with the good with the 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.839
 oldest we did not see the oldest 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.359
 it is this image as you can see us 

00:00:58.839 --> 00:01:02.829
 confirm here that there are donkeys and that 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.839
 inside the donkeys we can save 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.460
 things in the inventory also like 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.020
 can see we are already mounted inside 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.229
 of the donkey in the distance you can see 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.560
 horses moored to wings fences wings 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.659
 these fences we also have 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.369
 the name tag that is to name 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.409
 our horses to our animals or to 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.180
 any animal with whatever and 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.030
 we also have the these blocks of 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.310
 hay that serve us well to decorate and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.530
 they serve us so they are not built with 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.000
 forgive wheat and then we go to the 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.520
 next image in the following image 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.159
 we can see this good then 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.560
 mainly that there are hoppers there 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:41.270
 redstone blocks that there is this 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.780
 dynamite in the cart 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.640
 and that there are pressure sensors just 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.229
 what he had said makes some videos that 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.740
 I did not even know if it will be fine 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.750
 good there is this budget pressures 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.939
 Plate pressure plates of gold and 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.079
 iron these vials because I'll explain for 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.670
 what they serve once the 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.709
 really update ones 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.119
 redstone comparators that are these 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:06.319
 that they have three that is like a way 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:08.349
 triangular and we also have the where 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.310
 is not no I did not find it a meeting 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.069
 now I think that nothing else was that 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.450
 yes of this part of network are yes in the 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.120
 bottom part of our inventory already 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.200
 100% confirm us the bitcoin which is the 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:23.660
 lighthouse this the fireworks that are the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.310
 rockets and the loads for the 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.310
 rockets and in the last image that 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.140
 they went up today a little while ago we have 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.610
 this image that I am going to divide into 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.500
 four ok so you can see it 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.730
 a little better then in the first one that 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.370
 we have in the first we have a 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.340
 inventory where you can see this 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.780
 creating fireworks and 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.849
 truth is that I can not see very well 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:46.280
 what is there in the bottom but 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:47.630
 I think there is not this many things 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.910
 important since 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.710
 they almost told us everything to come and 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.580
 as you can see in this same image to 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.650
 the right 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.480
 we can see that there are some widder 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.390
 skeletons that this confirms to us that already 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.590
 have widder skeletons in survival 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.450
 then in this image as we can see 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.760
 we are already inside the interface of 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.610
 beat with this and that can give us the bid 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.220
 with the normal speed speed for 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.510
 end jump jump resistance 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:16.010
 this strength and regeneration then here 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.960
 is the interface already also with this 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.130
 confirmed we have here in the part of 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:21.380
 down also from this inventory the 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.270
 hopper that would be the new thing and the beat with 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.170
 which is exactly where we are stuck 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.700
 then in the next image we have a 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.740
 drop see just if it is a drop er 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:32.870
 how can they do not I do not know if it's hopper or 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.150
 drop the own one according to me is a drop er 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.160
 says up dropper and if not then 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.390
 I'm wrong and it 's hopper yes I think 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.250
 which is a hopper because the drop is not 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.890
 they have that is good the joke is that it is 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.420
 a hopper and then we see to feed the 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.940
 hopper that we can put things in and 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.500
 blah blah blah blah blah and then in the last 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.420
 of these images we still have a horse 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.700
 we have this interface that you 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.250
 we can put gun 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.410
 we have the interface that has the 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.930
 chair to mount and we have the 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.760
 good interface here at the bottom 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.580
 in the bar that are the blocks of 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.440
 tnt the light sensors and day and night 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.360
 this had not said in on an image 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.599
 last but but here I tell you 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.150
 this sensor is daylight day night 

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:17.829
 those and then more than anything this is would be 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.139
 the whole full picture of life in 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.180
 four and here we do not see a 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.160
 small image of playstation vita 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.470
 where we can see some leaders that the 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.389
 tone is very clearly then it has 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.310
 hidden something else in those images and 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.250
 I'm going to be checking but according to me it's already 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.960
 everything would be everything and I hope that you 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.610
 have liked this video that you like 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.100
 to share it because I'm sure that 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.169
 already for December perhaps as by 12 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:42.580
 December x is for December 16 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.560
 that we will have this update 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:49.830
 running on our consoles so 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.830
 I hope your likes comments and goodbye
