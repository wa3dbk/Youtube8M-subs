00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.280
 what 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.340
 or 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:17.710
 let's prepare shrink or van cushing 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.630
 well I really do not know how to pronounce 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.000
 all I know is that this cake is 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:25.000
 delicious and the ingredients for 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.480
 prepare them are 250 grams of 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.570
 butter 250 grams of sugar 7 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.390
 eggs 150 grams of flour 100 grams 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.399
 of vanilla extract cornstarch 2 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.800
 tablespoons of pure cocoa powder without 

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.980
 sugar and desire for chocolate 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.860
 let's start by erasing the background of a 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:50.480
 18 cm diameter removable mold 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:53.140
 with baking paper we separate the whites 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.140
 of the yolks 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.400
 we mount the whites to the point of snow with 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.130
 a pinch of salt 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:08.260
 we will know that the whites are mounted and 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:08.260
 when we turn the goal around, they do not fall 

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:13.890
 in another bowl we are going to mix the flour 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.940
 together with the cornstarch 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.940
 and we reserve it 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.770
 and now in another bowl we put the 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.679
 butter that has to be squishy 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.659
 together with the sugar and we will beat it 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.659
 until it is fully integrated 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.440
 once we have it integrated 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:38.450
 we add the yolks of a moon and 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.759
 we mix of each led 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.650
 we repeat the process until we incorporate 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.190
 all the yolks 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.990
 now we are going to add the flour together 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.340
 with the cornstarch and we 're going to do it in two 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.340
 times and sifting the 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.140
 when we have it well mixed 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.970
 we add the whites to the point of snow and 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.730
 let's mix with movements 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.500
 envelopes very slowly and with much 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.230
 beware this is the most difficult process 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.390
 of the cake since we will have to 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.290
 do it very slowly so that the whites 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.290
 do not get us down 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.080
 we divide the mass into 2 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.240
 We put an extract to one of the halves 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.240
 vanilla 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.640
 and the other to the two tablespoons of 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:39.640
 pure cocoa powder without sugar 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.360
 We preheat the oven to 200 degrees only 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.180
 with heat on top that is the grill 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.510
 from the oven and we're going to put in our 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:01.460
 mold 2 tablespoons of the white dough and 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.460
 We spread it out like a pancake 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:06.360
 once extended we are going to bake it 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.580
 for two or three minutes you have to 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.190
 stay slightly browned above 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.069
 we take them out of the oven we put two 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.620
 tablespoons of chocolate dough what 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.840
 turn to extend and re-meter 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:22.940
 in the oven for two or three minutes and 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.940
 so until you finish with all the layers 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.220
 when we have baked the last 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:31.240
 layer let's leave the cake in the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:33.750
 mold for 15 minutes later what 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.910
 unmold and let it cool 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.670
 completely and meanwhile we are going to 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.590
 prepare our chocolate ganache 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.050
 that we will do it with 200 milliliters of 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:46.420
 cream 200 grams of chocolate and one 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.460
 spoonful of butter I'll leave you 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:50.860
 the recipe link in the description 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:54.000
 of the video you can do it with the 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.000
 chocolate that you prefer 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:00.320
 Now we are going to prepare a system for 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.120
 bathe the cake with a grid and a 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:04.720
 source that does not fall down to us 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.280
 chocolate by the table 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:11.030
 we put the cake on top of the grid 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.200
 and we overturn the desire for chocolate 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.270
 trying to make it fall for all 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.889
 edges and the cake is completely 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.919
 cover 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:24.550
 I use chocolate milk mixture 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:26.979
 and black chocolate once we 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:29.169
 cover let it rest a few minutes 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.050
 and then we'll add balls of 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:35.669
 chocolate by the edge we can do it or 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:35.669
 helping us with a spatula 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.930
 or directly with your hand like you 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.930
 to a better country 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.229
 and now with the help of some 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.840
 spatulas we pass it to the plate 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.409
 presentation and ready we have our 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.740
 Delicious cake with unpronounceable name 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:57.740
 I hope you like it
