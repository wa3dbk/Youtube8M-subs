00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
flowers and arranging them I guess and

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.420 
flowers and arranging them I guess and
then<00:02:47.080> I'm<00:02:47.230> cutting<00:02:47.590> out<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.770> stem<00:02:47.980> to<00:02:48.010> make<00:02:48.280> it

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
then I'm cutting out the stem to make it

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.820 
then I'm cutting out the stem to make it
more<00:02:48.550> realistic<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.390> then<00:02:50.020> putting<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.380> on<00:02:50.530> to

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830 
more realistic and then putting it on to

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.040 
more realistic and then putting it on to
the<00:02:51.190> habit<00:02:51.580> and<00:02:51.790> basically<00:02:52.180> glue<00:02:52.450> it<00:02:52.600> on<00:02:52.810> it's

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:53.050

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:55.210

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.490 

hard<00:03:06.730> steel

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
hard steel

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:19.589 
hard steel
when<00:03:09.010> you've<00:03:09.190> been<00:03:09.340> fine

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.289 

let<00:03:20.499> me<00:03:20.829> onto<00:03:21.099> the<00:03:21.219> yatra<00:03:21.790> which<00:03:21.969> is<00:03:22.150> the

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
let me onto the yatra which is the

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.899 
let me onto the yatra which is the
geography<00:03:22.629> without<00:03:23.590> iron<00:03:24.129> transfer<00:03:24.519> papers

00:03:24.899 --> 00:03:24.909 
geography without iron transfer papers

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:26.849 
geography without iron transfer papers
so<00:03:25.180> I'm<00:03:25.389> just<00:03:25.629> simply<00:03:25.840> tracing<00:03:26.650> out<00:03:26.739> my

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:26.859

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
letters from a computer I think this way

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.989 
letters from a computer I think this way
saves<00:03:28.840> you<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.019> lot<00:03:29.319> more<00:03:29.530> ink<00:03:29.739> and<00:03:30.010> it's<00:03:30.730> super

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:30.999 
saves you a lot more ink and it's super

00:03:30.999 --> 00:03:32.970 
saves you a lot more ink and it's super
easy<00:03:31.120> as<00:03:31.389> well<00:03:31.629> so<00:03:31.900> I'm<00:03:32.019> just<00:03:32.230> cutting<00:03:32.739> out<00:03:32.920> my

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
easy as well so I'm just cutting out my

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.720

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.860 
can learn how to make some DIY branding
of<00:03:44.349> their<00:03:44.530> shirts<00:03:44.769> so<00:03:45.519> I'm<00:03:45.639> taping<00:03:45.909> my<00:03:46.329> stencil

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
of their shirts so I'm taping my stencil

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.750 
of their shirts so I'm taping my stencil
down<00:03:46.989> and<00:03:47.230> basically<00:03:47.829> going<00:03:48.099> over<00:03:48.280> with<00:03:48.579> some

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
down and basically going over with some

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.399 
down and basically going over with some
white<00:03:48.939> acrylic<00:03:49.120> paint<00:03:49.419> and<00:03:49.810> you<00:03:49.959> can<00:03:50.109> also<00:03:50.230> use

00:03:50.399 --> 00:03:50.409 
white acrylic paint and you can also use

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.349 
white acrylic paint and you can also use
white<00:03:50.680> fabric<00:03:51.219> paint<00:03:51.249> but<00:03:51.669> I<00:03:51.700> think<00:03:51.969> white

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:52.359 
white fabric paint but I think white

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:55.199 
white fabric paint but I think white
paint<00:03:52.840> works<00:03:53.019> the<00:03:53.200> best<00:03:53.379> and<00:03:53.620> I'm<00:03:54.370> just<00:03:54.669> going

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
paint works the best and I'm just going

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:03.400 
paint works the best and I'm just going
over<00:03:55.329> that<00:03:55.870> with<00:03:56.260> a<00:03:56.469> sponge<00:03:56.950> brush

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:06.460 

so<00:04:04.220> when<00:04:04.700> you<00:04:04.790> remove<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.360> as<00:04:05.540> you<00:04:06.110> can<00:04:06.230> see<00:04:06.440> I

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
so when you remove it as you can see I

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.290 
so when you remove it as you can see I
messed<00:04:06.860> up<00:04:07.070> quite<00:04:07.430> a<00:04:07.460> bit<00:04:07.760> you<00:04:08.120> can<00:04:08.270> just

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
messed up quite a bit you can just

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.510 
messed up quite a bit you can just
easily<00:04:08.780> blend<00:04:09.560> it<00:04:09.680> out<00:04:09.830> and<00:04:10.040> to<00:04:10.190> make<00:04:10.220> that

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:10.520 
easily blend it out and to make that

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.670 
easily blend it out and to make that
watercolor<00:04:10.940> effect<00:04:11.690> I<00:04:11.840> guess<00:04:12.050> if<00:04:12.230> you<00:04:12.410> want<00:04:12.590> to

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
watercolor effect I guess if you want to

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.350 
watercolor effect I guess if you want to
