00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.859
 I want to summarize the collection because 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.320
 we can say that they did not come to the end already 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.149
 became the last training we spent 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:53.100
 here a few good weeks done 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.810
 a lot of hard work was given a huge 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.369
 attention to athletic training in 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.439
 gym as well as the program 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.990
 workouts on ice as you see here 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.100
 great setting 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.560
 good for training with high 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.939
 recoil is useful for players so 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.539
 more that we conducted two controls 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.910
 match 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.110
 especially the match was a match with a tractor 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.480
 exactly the game that is emotional 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.000
 lit the team and rallied it 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:21.030
 I would like to listen to him Frank Novices 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.220
 novice teams fashion as for 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.720
 scores of all novice metallurgist then in 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.730
 such broods can not be based 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.250
 exclusively on 2 pre-season games 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.200
 I liked that the young players were 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.030
 very passionate about competing with a tractor 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.459
 the more so because the match was very 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.410
 physically tense with the fight themes 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.480
 more interesting was the confrontation of ours 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.819
 young beginners with veterans of Chelyabinsk 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.310
 our guys wanted to prove they were worthy 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.410
 be part of the team were charged that 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.750
 found a good reflection of our psychology 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.810
 experienced players this is very positive 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.810
 moment 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.200
 but
