00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.219
 and move on think not by chance god 

00:00:07.479 --> 00:00:13.650
 created us in such a way that to us 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.650
 required daily and physical nutrition 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:21.140
 when the children of israel you came out of egypt 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.630
 for about 40 years they ate what 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.470
 called manna they could not live 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:30.980
 hunting their way of life did not allow to lead 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.829
 agriculture so they just 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.570
 there was no choice 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.899
 actually could sent them every day 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.899
 I'm going I think that at least one of 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:46.610
 his goals were to teach 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:49.480
 them remember him think about him look to 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:54.290
 him and believe in him 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:57.080
 for he was the source of their life 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:01:00.080
 he did it so it became a matter 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:02.960
 every day they could not collect manna 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.630
 and store it it could only have 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.430
 during the day they could not forget who 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.430
 was the source of their blessings 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.820
 nowadays you can do this 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.240
 the spiritual parallel we all recognize 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.610
 need for physical nutrition 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.280
 if we forget about this hunger and thirst 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.680
 remind us with all the strength but 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.680
 need for spiritual food so much 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.070
 great it does not come in the form of food and 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:36.159
 drinking but in our constant pursuit 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.380
 communicate with god 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.060
 we should not think that we can 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.939
 live the days of the week without spiritual food 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:48.789
 do not suffer while avoiding the detrimental 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:50.799
 influences on our spiritual life if we 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.350
 recognize the reality of our need for 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.200
 daily manifestation of the spiritual and estuary 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.039
 then it will help us to strengthen more 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.049
 our determination 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:03.090
 do right and serve others 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:05.759
 to people than if we forgot about god 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.399
 sometimes people think like all these little things 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:11.019
 immersion prayer scripture 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.319
 reflections can produce such 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:18.129
 huge changes in life 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:20.799
 however they can whatever little things they 

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.459
 no matter what routine they seem 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:27.450
 looked like 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:27.450
 day by day they transform us
