just<00:00:00.390> a<00:00:00.450> quick<00:00:00.630> tutorial<00:00:00.810> on<00:00:01.260> gchat<00:00:02.100> trees

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
just a quick tutorial on gchat trees

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.160 
just a quick tutorial on gchat trees
using<00:00:03.210> 3ds<00:00:03.840> max<00:00:04.819> 2013<00:00:05.819> we've<00:00:06.750> got<00:00:06.899> a<00:00:06.930> football

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
using 3ds max 2013 we've got a football

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.669 
using 3ds max 2013 we've got a football
here<00:00:07.649> we<00:00:08.010> want<00:00:08.189> to<00:00:08.280> make<00:00:08.429> it<00:00:08.670> go<00:00:09.120> from<00:00:09.480> one<00:00:10.349> side

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
here we want to make it go from one side

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.930 
here we want to make it go from one side
to<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:10.950> other<00:00:11.070> and<00:00:12.110> using<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.320> trajectory<00:00:13.940> so

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
to the other and using the trajectory so

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.210 
to the other and using the trajectory so
the<00:00:15.269> first<00:00:15.480> thing<00:00:15.570> we<00:00:15.809> do<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.049> select<00:00:17.039> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
the first thing we do is select the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.939 
the first thing we do is select the
object<00:00:17.640> in<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.210> case<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.960> football<00:00:19.350> and

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
object in this case the football and

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.519 
object in this case the football and
we're<00:00:20.070> going<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.250> make<00:00:20.340> it<00:00:20.609> go<00:00:20.820> always<00:00:21.720> around

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
we're going to make it go always around

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.820 
we're going to make it go always around
and<00:00:22.890> back<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.490> where<00:00:23.640> it<00:00:23.970> started<00:00:24.710> so<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
and back to where it started so the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.589 
and back to where it started so the
first<00:00:26.070> thing<00:00:26.160> we<00:00:26.369> do<00:00:26.519> make<00:00:26.910> sure<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.180> objects

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
first thing we do make sure the objects

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:33.160 
first thing we do make sure the objects
selected<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:29.070> then<00:00:29.099> click<00:00:29.390> on<00:00:31.009> shapes<00:00:32.009> and

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
selected and then click on shapes and

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.220 
selected and then click on shapes and
draw<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.200> line<00:00:35.329> where<00:00:36.329> we<00:00:36.600> want<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.870> ball<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.079> go

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
draw a line where we want the ball to go

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.530 
draw a line where we want the ball to go
so<00:00:37.860> we're<00:00:38.010> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> go<00:00:38.370> around<00:00:38.520> here<00:00:39.120> to

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
so we're going to go around here to

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.819 
so we're going to go around here to
there<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:40.559> round<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.309> back<00:00:41.489> again<00:00:42.290> okay<00:00:43.290> so

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
there and round and back again okay so

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.790 
there and round and back again okay so
once<00:00:44.010> we've<00:00:44.250> done<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.379> make<00:00:46.379> sure<00:00:46.410> the

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
once we've done that and make sure the

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.650 
once we've done that and make sure the
object<00:00:47.129> selected<00:00:47.579> again<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.629> football<00:00:49.579> and

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
object selected again the football and

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.160 
object selected again the football and
click<00:00:51.660> on<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.020> motion<00:00:52.170> tab<00:00:52.730> and<00:00:53.750> it's<00:00:54.750> using

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
click on the motion tab and it's using

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.170 
click on the motion tab and it's using
parameters<00:00:55.680> or<00:00:55.890> changing<00:00:56.309> teach<00:00:56.520> ejector

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
parameters or changing teach ejector

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.810 
parameters or changing teach ejector
ease<00:00:59.840> and<00:01:00.840> then<00:01:01.109> we<00:01:01.320> click<00:01:01.859> on<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.250> convert

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
ease and then we click on the convert

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.109 
ease and then we click on the convert
from<00:01:03.270> button<00:01:04.080> and<00:01:04.500> click<00:01:04.920> on<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.640> line<00:01:05.850> with<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.300 
from button and click on the line with a
strong<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.590> it's<00:01:07.710> created<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
strong and then it's created a

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.990 
strong and then it's created a
trajectory<00:01:09.350> blessed<00:01:10.350> Politis<00:01:10.979> either<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.820> go

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
trajectory blessed Politis either it go

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.380 
trajectory blessed Politis either it go
around<00:01:12.390> there<00:01:13.549> obviously<00:01:14.549> you<00:01:14.700> notice<00:01:15.180> that

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
around there obviously you notice that

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.350 
around there obviously you notice that
it's<00:01:15.570> not<00:01:15.780> spinning<00:01:16.400> the<00:01:17.400> ball<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:18.150> going

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
it's not spinning the ball is going

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.440 
it's not spinning the ball is going
where<00:01:18.840> we<00:01:18.930> wanted<00:01:19.259> it<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.530> go<00:01:19.710> so<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
where we wanted it to go so with the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.859 
where we wanted it to go so with the
auto<00:01:21.600> key<00:01:22.080> selected<00:01:22.710> we<00:01:23.520> can<00:01:23.729> then<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.240> add<00:01:24.810> a

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
auto key selected we can then just add a

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.890 
auto key selected we can then just add a
few<00:01:25.140> key<00:01:25.409> frames<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:26.070> to<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.790> timeline<00:01:27.090> to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
few key frames in to the timeline to

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.830 
few key frames in to the timeline to
rotate<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> ball<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:29.850> click<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.360> rotate

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
rotate the ball so I click on the rotate

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.420 
rotate the ball so I click on the rotate
rotate<00:01:31.619> it<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.189> little<00:01:32.729> bit<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:34.130> it<00:01:35.130> doesn't

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
rotate it to little bit and it doesn't

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.039 
rotate it to little bit and it doesn't
really<00:01:35.549> matter<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.119> this<00:01:36.270> just<00:01:36.600> a<00:01:36.689> showing

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
really matter is this just a showing

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.890 
really matter is this just a showing
speaking<00:01:37.590> do<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.799> properly<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.670> just<00:01:39.630> keep

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
speaking do it properly and just keep

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.140 
speaking do it properly and just keep
rotating<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.070> all<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> way<00:01:42.060> around

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
rotating it like that all the way around

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.170 
rotating it like that all the way around
along<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.960> timeline<00:01:43.490> we've<00:01:44.490> only<00:01:44.640> got<00:01:44.820> except

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
along the timeline we've only got except

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.770 
along the timeline we've only got except
for<00:01:46.220> 100<00:01:47.220> at<00:01:47.369> normal<00:01:47.970> you<00:01:48.180> know<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.600> can

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
for 100 at normal you know you can

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.139 
for 100 at normal you know you can
extend<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:50.189> I<00:01:50.220> just<00:01:50.460> keep<00:01:50.670> doing<00:01:51.000> that

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
extend that so I just keep doing that

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.069 
extend that so I just keep doing that
until<00:01:52.460> obviously<00:01:53.460> changing<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.360> rotations

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
until obviously changing the rotations

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.660 
until obviously changing the rotations
exchanging<00:01:56.040> direction<00:01:57.860> you<00:01:58.860> can<00:01:59.100> play<00:01:59.490> about

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
exchanging direction you can play about

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.499 
exchanging direction you can play about
with<00:01:59.729> up<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.829> keep<00:02:02.070> doing<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.579> all<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
with up and just keep doing that all the

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.980 
with up and just keep doing that all the
way<00:02:03.600> through

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
way through

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.830 
way through
so<00:02:05.710> it's<00:02:05.890> bucket<00:02:06.520> so<00:02:06.850> where<00:02:07.420> you<00:02:07.540> want<00:02:07.720> the

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
so it's bucket so where you want the

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.680 
so it's bucket so where you want the
ball<00:02:07.869> to<00:02:08.050> be<00:02:09.450> two<00:02:10.450> more<00:02:10.690> like<00:02:11.110> an<00:02:11.349> hour<00:02:11.530> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.820 

back<00:02:16.690> it<00:02:16.959> beginning<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:18.310> rotation<00:02:19.120> there

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
back it beginning the rotation there

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.000 
back it beginning the rotation there
okay<00:02:21.690> return<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> thought<00:02:23.019> okay<00:02:23.440> so<00:02:23.500> I<00:02:23.769> don't

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
okay return a thought okay so I don't

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:31.550 
okay return a thought okay so I don't
mess<00:02:24.220> up<00:02:24.480> scooter<00:02:25.480> full<00:02:25.870> screen<00:02:27.690> then<00:02:28.690> I<00:02:28.720> go<00:02:29.019> on

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.400 

you<00:02:32.560> can<00:02:32.650> see<00:02:32.920> it's<00:02:33.069> turning<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:34.019> not<00:02:35.019> billion

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
you can see it's turning and not billion

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.199
