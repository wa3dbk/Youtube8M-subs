00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.810 
well I guess the most important things
might<00:02:30.110> it's<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.710> points<00:02:30.980> issue<00:02:31.100> we've<00:02:31.610> got<00:02:31.730> to

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
might it's the points issue we've got to

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:33.370 
might it's the points issue we've got to
build<00:02:31.940> a<00:02:32.090> foundation<00:02:32.270> Eclipse<00:02:32.990> or<00:02:33.170> for<00:02:33.320> the
