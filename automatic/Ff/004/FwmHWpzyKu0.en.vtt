00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.930
 Hello friends 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.520
 Sharaini crater released bg on 40 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.220
 man but at least went such 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.820
 rumors it must be peculiar 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.400
 alterac 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.340
 by design but nothing 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.140
 left and sit on the causal does not explain 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.329
 nonetheless it's a cry I just 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.950
 fine really not at all 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.360
 Only the base of the alliance is ready. 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:28.070
 which is made in style 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.890
 night elves and very beautiful buildings 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.149
 here and the base of the horde is completely absent 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.190
 least get there not 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.019
 it seems possible for some reason 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:37.489
 a huge number of underground passages to 

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.190
 base lions I do not know what is the reason 

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.960
 That's what they look like, I absolutely do not know 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.210
 why did they need skill and color 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.460
 bg are quite standard underground 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.670
 moves we have already met for example when 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:53.359
 rocked for the night elf but why do they 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:55.609
 here on bg on plan bug 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.249
 I often have ponies also have very 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.499
 strange camp is not clear who is at home 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.120
 similar to the architecture of the 3rd belly he 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:04.430
 is also in the cave why is another 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.089
 Cave I have no idea but it looks 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.089
 everything is funny 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.200
 also deserves special attention 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.979
 these two huge dragon have one of 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.930
 which head is missing but it is not 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.940
 development problem is such an idea 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.830
 also very beautiful location by itself 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.360
 myself that is weed waterfalls all good 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.619
 and the place for the bloody battle is not 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.009
 unfortunately on this very beautiful 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.670
 A beautiful map can have a lot of bugs 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.320
 become texture just drown in the grass and 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.790
 here is a strange place we still found 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.640
 when we walked to be honest already by 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.680
 the third circle went and got here like this 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.539
 incomprehensible where in textures somewhere and 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.759
 turned out to be some kind of elf building 

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:52.470
 incomprehensible where it leads and incomprehensible 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.479
 why should it be either it was 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.920
 part of the mole times the balls are not clear i think 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.780
 what no i think it's just some 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.070
 unfinished location in which we 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.979
 by chance as it turned out 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.289
 but when you climb hidden locations to 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.880
 end in which it is impossible for you without 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.500
 cream care or without any 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.810
 special programs or someone hacking 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.940
 games without adding files can do anything 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.019
 happen including this situation 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.019
 when you get it is not clear where 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.549
 ok hope you like the crater 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.380
