00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello, welcome to yet another episode of 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.510
 canal life in the garden 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.120
 I'm Lúcia Borges Landscaper at 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.910
 Today's episode will show you how 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.130
 to produce seedlings apart from the 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.260
 daily maintenance of the garden in 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.150
 garden area maintenance 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.920
 sometimes we prune to adjust the 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.949
 size of plant to which shape 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.210
 to maintain a desired height 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:34.650
 as it is the case here that we are 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.750
 doing with viburnos and we fucking 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:40.199
 to move the plant so that it stays high 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.629
 some leftover piles 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.729
 then these stakes being 

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.580
 put in place, you can 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:49.949
 transform into a new seed then 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:53.070
 that same to take the leaves from below 

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.470
 for giving at a time maximum of 1 paulo 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.920
 in the case of the libolo mainly because 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.839
 he is more nor dare and these leaves that 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.909
 We're taking it out here from below. 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.339
 used to be the point of closure 

00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:07.829
 the gemma that will be exposed to 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.140
 potting the plant as soon as people 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.289
 What are you going to prepare? 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.299
 stake is very interesting to have 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.520
 good land then the vegetable land tac 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.700
 being placed a sieved earth 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.140
 sand has been laid and now it is 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.210
 being placed a little of this 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.890
 conditioner that is one that there is a 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.679
 very interesting substrate already 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.840
 enriched and with a little fertilizer to 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:34.140
 the best first roots closure 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.439
 output could feed the cuttings and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.149
 new molt 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.159
 The interesting thing is a revolver should mix 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.399
 mix with the texture stay every time 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.399
 best 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.280
 It's interesting to have a certain container. 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.110
 the market is the same and people are 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.840
 using the loot themselves with a 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.080
 drain hole the easy question after 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.880
 to be torn open to us 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.260
 to transform these little plants and 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.720
 even is to be planted in the garden 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.880
 again how a 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.980
 other container recycled container 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.860
 empty etc. 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.200
 so that's what's really making 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.780
 take the change to put her in that 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.790
 earth prepare them all and then 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.120
 people will put some water going 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.160
 maintain good quality with a shade 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.120
 do not hit the sun straight up to the plant 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.120
 new seedlings to be born 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.940
 the cuttings are already clean is that 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.940
 leaves until we leave people just put them there 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:57.170
 some seedlings have been made are only 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.720
 being placed we are wetting a 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.340
 look pretty every day until the plant 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.250
 how do I know she 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.040
 shattered I'll realize that new shoots 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:10.190
 will appear when new sheets appear 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.650
 above is a sign that the plant has 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:15.290
 managed to perform at low going to be born 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.660
 bud on it will down 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.220
 sometimes the faith-filled 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.890
 maintenance will be difficult to do 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.739
 Cleaning is hard to point out will not stay 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.840
 beautiful and the ideal would be to 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:32.870
 site of the same plant lot strip 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:35.180
 and ground to substrate 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.650
 Meanwhile, this changes back from this. 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.810
 It's not going to look good, we'll do it. 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.420
 and we begin to realize the 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.610
 amount of seedlings here the beard of 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.730
 snake the amount of music will have 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:48.829
 here that seedlings will be left over 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.390
 then we will redo and when the 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.780
 people will plant again will be left 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.970
 seedlings and green throws off we can is 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.280
 reuse another place very easy to 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.390
 to take seedlings from the heliopolis of 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.670
 snake because she 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:03.860
 loose with ease is just pulling mudinha 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.350
 she's coming loose 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.350
 We're cleaning up more schools. 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.450
 beautiful to be put back in the 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.060
 and seedlings that are not as 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.239
 beautiful are smaller saw seedlings 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:22.970
 new plantings for new gardens 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:26.540
 can cut some of the 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:30.460
 root that have splintered you have Neitiznot 

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:33.260
 formed it sprouts easily as well 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.990
 plant the way it is here it withers 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.450
 gets ugly site will get ugly feet 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.610
 to recover then we do this pruning 

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.540
 drastic in the foliage the plant does not feel 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.700
 and the change is that look I'll see 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.650
 that she performed because they will be born 

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:50.360
 larger and new sheets here 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.200
 This is a seedling ready to be placed. 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:53.200
 at the flowerbed 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.550
 this can be common in a plant of 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.260
 leaves she feels very sorry when the 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:05.360
 people strip the land we prune 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:08.660
 from the roots of a clump we are 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.840
 making around 45 seedlings and 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.300
 depending twisting sometimes even the 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.000
 plants thank this garden renovation 

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:18.860
 that we can produce seedlings 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.140
 from this to maintain the success of the earth 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.660
 at the same time a not-so-cool mix 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:25.669
 concentrated fertilizer with plenty of sand 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.100
 to give a legal texture there is study 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.470
 status ready for this we are 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.810
 making this substrate here is the same 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.690
 thing to put the change is already with 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:37.490
 a little land and he was going to put 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.410
 he changes it then completes and 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:42.380
 compaction we do in the hand after 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:46.270
 throw plenty of water in these new 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:46.270
 plants that will be placed in the garden 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:58.919
 the same thing 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.590
 Araranguá with generosity enough water 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:06.280
 watering the bill more to stay in 

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:08.590
 place of good quality and how are they 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.800
 sun after I can fills you 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.669
 put in the most intense sun and then some 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:18.039
 doubt and ask only sign in 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.919
 channel shares the most 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:23.699
 information here in the video description 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:23.699
 to the next
