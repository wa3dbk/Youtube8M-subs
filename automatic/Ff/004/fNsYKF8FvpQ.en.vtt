00:05:41.839 --> 00:05:41.849 
was going to say happening but I did say

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:44.809 
was going to say happening but I did say
that<00:05:42.090> but<00:05:42.900> we<00:05:43.080> decided<00:05:43.409> to<00:05:43.770> do<00:05:43.979> it<00:05:44.129> anyway<00:05:44.250> son

00:05:44.809 --> 00:05:44.819

custody yeah what
then<00:05:48.089> whatever<00:05:48.300> at<00:05:48.659> Frost<00:05:48.960> said<00:05:49.080> it<00:05:49.289> was<00:05:49.439> worth

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:49.650 
then whatever at Frost said it was worth

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:52.369 
then whatever at Frost said it was worth
it<00:05:49.889> but<00:05:50.550> we<00:05:51.089> made<00:05:51.270> it<00:05:51.330> worth<00:05:51.629> it<00:05:51.839> though<00:05:52.020> yeah

00:05:52.369 --> 00:05:52.379 
it but we made it worth it though yeah

00:05:52.379 --> 00:05:54.769 
it but we made it worth it though yeah
because<00:05:52.949> it<00:05:53.069> was<00:05:53.250> a<00:05:53.279> it<00:05:53.669> was<00:05:53.699> it<00:05:54.569> was<00:05:54.749> a

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
because it was a it was it was a

00:05:54.779 --> 00:05:58.059 
because it was a it was it was a
terrible<00:05:55.259> crime<00:05:55.499> so

00:05:58.059 --> 00:05:58.069 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.519 

we<00:05:58.400> dealt<00:05:58.639> with<00:05:58.729> the<00:05:58.939> rest<00:05:59.240> and<00:05:59.449> now<00:05:59.719> all<00:06:00.289> the

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:00.529 
we dealt with the rest and now all the

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:03.909 
we dealt with the rest and now all the
issues<00:06:00.830> have<00:06:01.009> had<00:06:01.219> right<00:06:01.869> how<00:06:02.869> are<00:06:02.900> you<00:06:03.199> and<00:06:03.589> I

00:06:03.909 --> 00:06:03.919 
issues have had right how are you and I

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:08.230 
issues have had right how are you and I
got<00:06:04.819> together<00:06:04.999> on<00:06:05.210> a<00:06:05.619> with<00:06:06.619> Jim<00:06:06.800> Richmond<00:06:07.309> on

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 
got together on a with Jim Richmond on

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:11.649 
got together on a with Jim Richmond on
the<00:06:08.539> engine<00:06:08.869> combo<00:06:09.319> and<00:06:10.539> for<00:06:11.539> an

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:11.659 
the engine combo and for an

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:13.510 
the engine combo and for an
eight-point-two<00:06:12.259> deck<00:06:12.499> for<00:06:12.919> a<00:06:12.949> small<00:06:13.279> engine

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
eight-point-two deck for a small engine

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.299 
eight-point-two deck for a small engine
delivered<00:06:14.360> over<00:06:14.569> here<00:06:14.749> well<00:06:14.990> yeah<00:06:15.319> this<00:06:16.129> is<00:06:16.249> a

00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:16.309 
delivered over here well yeah this is a

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:19.420 
delivered over here well yeah this is a
small<00:06:16.550> engine<00:06:17.110> with<00:06:18.110> a<00:06:18.139> lot<00:06:18.499> of<00:06:18.649> it<00:06:18.800> it's

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
small engine with a lot of it it's

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.399 
small engine with a lot of it it's
really<00:06:19.520> efficient<00:06:20.360> because<00:06:20.449> it's<00:06:20.779> a<00:06:20.930> really

00:06:21.399 --> 00:06:21.409 
really efficient because it's a really

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:24.119 
really efficient because it's a really
good<00:06:21.680> top<00:06:21.889> in<00:06:22.099> dollar<00:06:22.339> holy<00:06:22.699> shit

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:24.129 
good top in dollar holy shit

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:26.649 
good top in dollar holy shit
but<00:06:25.129> efficiency<00:06:25.729> doesn't<00:06:26.059> we'll<00:06:26.210> raise<00:06:26.449> this

00:06:26.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
but efficiency doesn't we'll raise this

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:29.709 
but efficiency doesn't we'll raise this
house<00:06:26.990> paradox<00:06:27.589> that<00:06:28.460> in<00:06:28.639> quickie<00:06:28.939> teeth<00:06:29.330> and

00:06:29.709 --> 00:06:29.719 
house paradox that in quickie teeth and

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:35.589 
house paradox that in quickie teeth and
a<00:06:30.169> reaction<00:06:30.680> come<00:06:30.830> here<00:06:31.099> a<00:06:31.309> drink<00:06:31.779> but<00:06:32.779> but<00:06:34.599> I'm

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
a reaction come here a drink but but I'm

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:38.260 
a reaction come here a drink but but I'm
racing<00:06:36.020> against<00:06:36.439> much<00:06:37.249> bigger<00:06:37.639> engines

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:38.270 
racing against much bigger engines

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.559 
racing against much bigger engines
generally<00:06:39.849> because<00:06:40.849> that's<00:06:41.180> the<00:06:41.389> weed<00:06:41.539> a

00:06:41.559 --> 00:06:41.569 
generally because that's the weed a

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:45.489 
generally because that's the weed a
bigger<00:06:41.870> horsepower<00:06:42.550> no<00:06:43.550> but<00:06:44.360> I<00:06:44.389> like<00:06:45.110> to<00:06:45.229> run<00:06:45.469> a

00:06:45.489 --> 00:06:45.499 
bigger horsepower no but I like to run a

00:06:45.499 --> 00:06:48.969 
bigger horsepower no but I like to run a
smaller<00:06:45.860> engine<00:06:46.370> with<00:06:46.969> efficiency<00:06:47.659> and<00:06:47.979> have

00:06:48.969 --> 00:06:48.979 
smaller engine with efficiency and have

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:49.600 
smaller engine with efficiency and have
some<00:06:49.159> fun

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
some fun

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.159
