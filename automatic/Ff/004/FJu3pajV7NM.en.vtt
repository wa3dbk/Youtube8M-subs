00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:05.450
 I'm a mess 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.230
 you asked yourself how they see the d 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:18.230
 and me 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:21.910
 some interesting facts 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.080
 it is true that in the night the cats 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:31.240
 can see better than humans 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.340
 the sun happens the opposite 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.150
 that's why we like to go out more than 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.250
 night 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.910
 this quality is shared by several 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.489
 animals 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.450
 including dogs which by the way 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.160
 that we are in this 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:47.850
 they do not see black and white 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.649
 s 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.300
 and others like the shark the wolves 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:56.300
 They have what is called a rug 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.470
 It is not a magic spell of Harry Potter 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:05.990
 is a complex fabric located in the 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:08.570
 back of the eyes 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.630
 of some animals among which no 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.700
 humans are 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:18.670
 the lucid carpet 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.670
 to absorb a lot of light 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.950
 It is also responsible for the 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:30.950
 low of your pussycat 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:40.659
 as with less light the cats can see 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:46.200
 better than humans in the dark 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:46.200
 on the other hand the text threshold 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.500
 since by allowing reception 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.700
 must limit the amount 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.439
 during the light hours the cats 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.439
 close the iris 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.370
 Depth of field much 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.380
 compared to the years 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.380
 because the human eye how 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.200
 like other animals 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.629
 many of these positive 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.050
 the first vision devices 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.050
 during the second 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:14.130
 I use night vision devices 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:18.710
 called zero generation 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:21.950
 since the beginning of 1939 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.500
 the personal portable system was called 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.880
 pump it 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.750
 and was attached to the rifles 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:32.180
 telescopes and snipers 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.380
 they incorporated light detectors 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:36.690
 infrared 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.320
 and they were used during the second 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.320
 world war 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:46.970
 the objective stores ambient light 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.890
 it can be of the moon or of the stars 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.890
 or some infrared light 

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.550
 when 

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.239
 image indicator 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.180
 composed of photons is transformed into 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.180
 elect 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:19.250
 light can be seen by the human eye
