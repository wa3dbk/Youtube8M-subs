 red is for them to know when they pulled out 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.890
 material a pretty I'm taking out one or 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.560
 two a day this hopefully you can 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:42.180
 continue like this at that speed 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.760
 it's also that speed for me and I say 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.250
 good as always of normal speed 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.560
 I think this is the bad title to 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.270
 touch them already normal because it's not very 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.970
 difficult idea and then explain some things 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:58.450
 You're welcome when you explained the second part 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.120
 but but it's all very very very fast very 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:05.210
 short statute brief so he has 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:07.070
 you are going to get in your way 

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:09.160
 to raise the melody in speed 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.160
 normal 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.860
 I have to see me 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:34.750
 good to the second sachs melody 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:37.240
 as always the red notes are with 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.110
 eighth key are higher when you're 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:47.370
 Little blues are a tribe 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:47.370
 quick apart from quick fixes like 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.880
 really good because you have to give it is not 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.580
 very difficult this rolita so I do not 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.500
 I'm going to play at slow speed this me 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.500
 I think that at normal speed it's pretty 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:09.320
 do not 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.950

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:44.040
 the second so you can see how it should be 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:46.560
 hearing from flying I wanted to tell you that the 

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:49.560
 second part the second truth is the 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.780
 original part of the sax the first is what 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:55.020
 who plays the accordion so if they want 

00:05:51.780 --> 00:05:58.110

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.480
