00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.539 

we<00:00:04.290> got<00:00:04.440> a<00:00:04.470> good<00:00:04.680> result<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.069> the<00:00:05.160> first<00:00:05.339> game

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
we got a good result in the first game

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.220 
we got a good result in the first game
but<00:00:05.819> we<00:00:05.940> didn't<00:00:06.150> think<00:00:06.240> we<00:00:06.390> played<00:00:06.690> as<00:00:07.020> well<00:00:07.049> as

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
but we didn't think we played as well as

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.680 
but we didn't think we played as well as
we<00:00:07.410> have<00:00:07.589> been<00:00:07.849> and<00:00:08.849> there's<00:00:09.030> there's<00:00:09.330> reasons

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
we have been and there's there's reasons

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.600 
we have been and there's there's reasons
for<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:09.929> I<00:00:09.990> think<00:00:10.290> our<00:00:10.380> nerves<00:00:10.559> got<00:00:10.800> got<00:00:11.160> us<00:00:11.340> a

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
for that I think our nerves got got us a

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.039 
for that I think our nerves got got us a
little<00:00:11.820> bit<00:00:12.380> new<00:00:13.380> environment<00:00:13.980> new<00:00:14.130> place<00:00:15.049> so

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
little bit new environment new place so

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.029 
little bit new environment new place so
i<00:00:16.080> think<00:00:16.230> we're<00:00:16.470> excited<00:00:16.680> for<00:00:16.830> this<00:00:16.980> challenge

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
i think we're excited for this challenge

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.830 
i think we're excited for this challenge
I<00:00:17.310> think<00:00:17.340> Cupid's<00:00:17.760> got<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.910> couple<00:00:18.119> good

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
I think Cupid's got a couple good

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.420 
I think Cupid's got a couple good
players<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.410> will<00:00:19.500> pose<00:00:19.740> a<00:00:19.770> problem<00:00:20.100> for<00:00:20.250> us

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
players that will pose a problem for us

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.300 
players that will pose a problem for us
and<00:00:20.789> I<00:00:21.210> think<00:00:21.830> hopefully<00:00:22.830> it'll<00:00:23.070> bring<00:00:23.189> out

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
and I think hopefully it'll bring out

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.250 
and I think hopefully it'll bring out
the<00:00:23.430> best<00:00:23.580> in<00:00:23.760> our<00:00:23.910> team<00:00:24.150> really<00:00:24.480> excited<00:00:25.199> by

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
that I kind of lino have a look but a

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.580 
that I kind of lino have a look but a
little<00:00:39.750> bit<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.930> experience<00:00:40.230> I<00:00:40.379> feel<00:00:40.530> like

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
little bit of experience I feel like

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.680 
little bit of experience I feel like
tomorrow<00:00:40.920> if<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.640> get<00:00:41.850> in<00:00:42.000> or<00:00:42.180> whatever<00:00:42.360> way<00:00:42.660> I

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
tomorrow if I get in or whatever way I

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.450 
tomorrow if I get in or whatever way I
can<00:00:42.750> help<00:00:42.960> impact<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.410> team<00:00:43.590> I'm<00:00:43.800> all<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.340> it

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
can help impact the team I'm all for it

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.119 
can help impact the team I'm all for it
I<00:00:44.610> think<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:45.629> first<00:00:45.840> game<00:00:46.079> the<00:00:46.620> team<00:00:46.829> kind<00:00:47.100> of

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
I think the first game the team kind of

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.830 
I think the first game the team kind of
sat<00:00:47.340> in<00:00:47.460> on<00:00:47.640> us<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.030> middle<00:00:48.149> so<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.690> think

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
sat in on us in the middle so I think

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.479 
sat in on us in the middle so I think
we're<00:00:49.020> gonna<00:00:49.110> use<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.469> flanks<00:00:49.800> more<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.309> try

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
we're gonna use the flanks more and try

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.760 
we're gonna use the flanks more and try
and<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:51.360> know<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.510> use<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:51.960> better<00:00:52.440> I

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
and you know just use that better I

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.799 
and you know just use that better I
think<00:00:53.129> we<00:00:53.280> tried<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.120> force<00:00:54.329> a<00:00:54.420> little<00:00:54.600> bit<00:00:54.690> to

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
think we tried to force a little bit to

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.119 
think we tried to force a little bit to
them<00:00:54.930> in<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> middle<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.649> think<00:00:55.920> we<00:00:56.010> did

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
them in the middle so I think we did

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.189 
them in the middle so I think we did
that<00:00:56.190> one<00:00:56.460> I<00:00:56.670> think<00:00:56.910> as<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> team<00:00:57.510> we<00:00:57.780> just<00:00:57.960> we

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
that one I think as a team we just we

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.810 
that one I think as a team we just we
know<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.440> can<00:00:58.590> play<00:00:58.620> at<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.859> faster<00:00:59.219> pace<00:00:59.250> and

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
know we can play at a faster pace and

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.639 
know we can play at a faster pace and
obviously<00:01:00.390> our<00:01:00.539> goal<00:01:00.780> is<00:01:00.899> to<00:01:00.960> be<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.170> play

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
obviously our goal is to be the play

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.280 
obviously our goal is to be the play
with<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:02.100> fastest<00:01:02.520> soccer<00:01:02.730> in<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.969> world<00:01:03.290> and

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
with the fastest soccer in the world and

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.289 
with the fastest soccer in the world and
I<00:01:04.500> think<00:01:04.769> we're<00:01:05.010> just<00:01:05.220> moving<00:01:05.430> our<00:01:06.000> goal<00:01:06.180> is

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
I think we're just moving our goal is

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.760 
I think we're just moving our goal is
just<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.510> move<00:01:06.720> forward<00:01:06.990> towards<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.740> goal

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
just to move forward towards that goal

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.910 
just to move forward towards that goal
and<00:01:07.979> I'm<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.600> think<00:01:09.869> we<00:01:09.930> got<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.290> pre-game

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
and I'm just I think we got the pre-game

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.289 
and I'm just I think we got the pre-game
jitters<00:01:10.979> out<00:01:11.490> in<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> first<00:01:11.939> game<00:01:12.060> jitters

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
jitters out in the first game jitters

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.120 
jitters out in the first game jitters
out<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.930> think<00:01:13.260> that's<00:01:13.619> definitely<00:01:14.010> gonna

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
out and I think that's definitely gonna

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.100 
out and I think that's definitely gonna
be<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.310> focus<00:01:14.700> for<00:01:14.820> us<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.090> game<00:01:15.299> coming<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.689> um

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
be a focus for us this game coming up um

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.870 
be a focus for us this game coming up um
I<00:01:16.380> think<00:01:16.439> we're<00:01:17.009> going<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.250> focus<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.729> playing

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
I think we're going to focus on playing

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.520 
I think we're going to focus on playing
our<00:01:18.119> style<00:01:18.390> again<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.750> think<00:01:18.900> a<00:01:19.170> little<00:01:19.290> bit<00:01:19.439> in

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
our style again I think a little bit in

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.780 
our style again I think a little bit in
the<00:01:19.590> first<00:01:19.740> half<00:01:19.920> we<00:01:20.159> let<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> nerves<00:01:20.580> get<00:01:20.759> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the first half we let the nerves get the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.609 
the first half we let the nerves get the
best<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.090> us<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.509> some<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.049> our<00:01:22.170> possession

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
best of us and some of our possession

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.109 
best of us and some of our possession
wasn't<00:01:22.979> as<00:01:23.070> great<00:01:23.280> as<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.549> hoped<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.909> would<00:01:24.000> be

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
wasn't as great as we hoped it would be

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:25.580 
wasn't as great as we hoped it would be
so<00:01:24.360> we<00:01:24.780> kind<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:24.990> want<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.200> build<00:01:25.350> off<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
so we kind of want to build off the

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.469 
so we kind of want to build off the
second<00:01:25.860> half<00:01:26.040> and<00:01:26.310> continue<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.240> get<00:01:27.330> better

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
second half and continue to get better

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.270 
second half and continue to get better
the<00:01:28.049> first<00:01:28.290> one<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.500> great<00:01:28.829> we<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.189> to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
the first one was great we just have to

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.190 
the first one was great we just have to
keep<00:01:29.400> working<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.909> we<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.540> good<00:01:30.689> confidence

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
keep working it we have good confidence

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.660 
keep working it we have good confidence
now<00:01:31.409> everyone<00:01:31.829> knows<00:01:31.860> we<00:01:32.310> have<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> good<00:01:32.640> chance

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
now everyone knows we have a good chance

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.010 
now everyone knows we have a good chance
we<00:01:33.150> just<00:01:33.329> have<00:01:33.420> to<00:01:33.509> keep<00:01:33.630> pushing<00:01:33.930> ourselves

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
we just have to keep pushing ourselves

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:42.990 
we just have to keep pushing ourselves
keep<00:01:34.409> working<00:01:34.710> we<00:01:34.799> can't<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.130> complacent

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.060 

today<00:01:44.200> the<00:01:45.200> people<00:01:45.470> that<00:01:45.590> didn't<00:01:45.770> play<00:01:45.890> for

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
today the people that didn't play for

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.380 
today the people that didn't play for

five minutes went out and had a training

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.180 
five minutes went out and had a training
session<00:01:47.660> by<00:01:48.350> the<00:01:48.410> people<00:01:48.710> that<00:01:48.860> played<00:01:49.010> over

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
session by the people that played over

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.730 
session by the people that played over

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
45 minutes the guy got to sleep in a

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.320 
45 minutes the guy got to sleep in a
little<00:01:51.920> bit<00:01:52.100> do<00:01:52.400> a<00:01:52.430> pool<00:01:52.940> workout

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
little bit do a pool workout

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:54.910 
little bit do a pool workout
regeneration<00:01:53.900> and<00:01:54.260> then<00:01:54.380> have<00:01:54.620> just<00:01:54.770> been

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
regeneration and then have just been

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.370 
regeneration and then have just been
kind<00:01:55.130> of<00:01:55.190> relaxing<00:01:55.760> when<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:56.720> look<00:01:56.900> at<00:01:57.080> it<00:01:57.110> if

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
kind of relaxing when you look at it if

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.350 
kind of relaxing when you look at it if
you<00:01:58.070> know<00:01:58.160> just<00:01:58.369> in<00:01:58.490> these<00:01:58.610> first<00:01:58.790> round<00:01:59.090> games

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
you know just in these first round games

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.790 
you know just in these first round games
it's<00:01:59.570> 3<00:01:59.630> games<00:01:59.990> in<00:02:00.140> five<00:02:00.320> days<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:00.680> that's

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 
it's 3 games in five days so that's

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.380 
it's 3 games in five days so that's
that's<00:02:01.010> quite<00:02:01.400> a<00:02:01.460> quick<00:02:01.640> turnaround<00:02:01.850> so<00:02:02.270> we

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
that's quite a quick turnaround so we

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.969 
that's quite a quick turnaround so we
just<00:02:02.540> have<00:02:02.630> to<00:02:02.810> make<00:02:02.930> sure<00:02:02.990> they're<00:02:03.320> good<00:02:03.890> and

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
just have to make sure they're good and

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.460 
just have to make sure they're good and
rested<00:02:04.369> in<00:02:04.490> there<00:02:04.700> as<00:02:05.170> prepared<00:02:06.170> as<00:02:06.260> possible

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
rested in there as prepared as possible

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.210 
rested in there as prepared as possible
I<00:02:06.979> think<00:02:07.910> that<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.360> day<00:02:08.600> off<00:02:08.840> is<00:02:09.200> good<00:02:09.500> we<00:02:10.070> need

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
I think that the day off is good we need

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.100 
I think that the day off is good we need
regeneration<00:02:10.880> because<00:02:11.300> there's<00:02:11.480> five<00:02:11.810> games

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
regeneration because there's five games

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.470 
regeneration because there's five games
you<00:02:12.320> need<00:02:12.410> our<00:02:12.560> legs<00:02:12.800> to<00:02:13.130> last<00:02:13.880> all<00:02:14.180> the<00:02:14.300> game

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
you need our legs to last all the game

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.420 
you need our legs to last all the game
so<00:02:14.870> I<00:02:15.050> think<00:02:15.320> it's<00:02:15.440> good<00:02:15.590> what<00:02:16.130> we're<00:02:16.280> trying

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
so I think it's good what we're trying

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.010 
so I think it's good what we're trying
to<00:02:16.610> do<00:02:16.760> in<00:02:16.880> a<00:02:16.970> tournament<00:02:17.360> like<00:02:17.390> this<00:02:17.480> I<00:02:17.690> think

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
to do in a tournament like this I think

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.560 
to do in a tournament like this I think
you<00:02:18.320> have<00:02:18.440> a<00:02:18.470> squad<00:02:18.800> of<00:02:18.860> 20<00:02:19.280> players<00:02:19.520> and<00:02:20.120> I

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
you have a squad of 20 players and I

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.720 
you have a squad of 20 players and I
think<00:02:20.980> everyone<00:02:21.980> needs<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.370> little<00:02:22.489> something

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
think everyone needs a little something

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.520 
think everyone needs a little something
different<00:02:22.970> you<00:02:23.540> know<00:02:23.660> there's<00:02:24.080> some<00:02:24.260> players

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
different you know there's some players

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.580 
different you know there's some players
that<00:02:24.830> may<00:02:25.280> be<00:02:25.340> played<00:02:25.640> 90<00:02:26.030> minutes<00:02:26.300> so<00:02:26.590> we

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
that may be played 90 minutes so we

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.170 
that may be played 90 minutes so we
can't<00:02:27.830> do<00:02:27.950> too<00:02:28.130> much<00:02:28.160> with<00:02:28.520> them<00:02:28.670> we<00:02:28.850> can't<00:02:29.030> ask

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
can't do too much with them we can't ask

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.970 
can't do too much with them we can't ask
too<00:02:29.390> much<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.600> them<00:02:29.900> in<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.260> off<00:02:30.410> day<00:02:30.680> because

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
too much of them in the off day because

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.860 
too much of them in the off day because
they<00:02:31.100> have<00:02:31.190> to<00:02:31.280> get<00:02:31.400> recovered<00:02:31.820> for<00:02:32.060> in<00:02:32.720> order

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
they have to get recovered for in order

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.570 
they have to get recovered for in order
to<00:02:33.020> be<00:02:33.140> prepared<00:02:33.320> for<00:02:33.560> the<00:02:33.680> next<00:02:33.920> game<00:02:34.070> there's

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
to be prepared for the next game there's

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.740 
to be prepared for the next game there's
some<00:02:34.760> maybe<00:02:34.970> that<00:02:35.120> didn't<00:02:35.420> get<00:02:35.510> a<00:02:35.540> lot<00:02:35.720> of

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
some maybe that didn't get a lot of

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.870 
some maybe that didn't get a lot of
minutes<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.230> so<00:02:36.440> we<00:02:37.070> can<00:02:37.250> we<00:02:37.400> can<00:02:37.520> afford<00:02:37.700> to

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
minutes and so we can we can afford to

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.910 
minutes and so we can we can afford to
go<00:02:37.970> out<00:02:38.030> with<00:02:38.090> them<00:02:38.420> physically<00:02:39.080> and<00:02:39.440> do<00:02:39.709> some

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
go out with them physically and do some

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.770 
go out with them physically and do some

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
things and keep them sharp on the ball

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.680
