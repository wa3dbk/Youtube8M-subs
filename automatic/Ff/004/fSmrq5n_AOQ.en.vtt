00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:11.910
 And then, my beauty with you is the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.490
 next is this program that I'm going to 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.470
 passing on to you is a problem for you 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.160
 which has a slightly older machine 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:22.410
 or have a machine with a defect shipped 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.730
 or the machine has internal defect 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:30.000
 then your schedule does not adjust 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.850
 automatically the truth is that disgust 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.230
 automatically is that every time you 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.530
 would say the computer 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.559
 the time is off 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.320
 windows itself then this program is 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.590
 for you to adjust this automatically 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.489
 but you have a constant connection to the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.520
 Internet 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.280
 people often use connection to the 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.460
 internet then you were in the program 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.059
 you have it adjusts suits 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:03.059
 this is automatically turned on 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.040
 for anyone who has an issue that has issues 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:08.369
 a problem on the motherboard that does not 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.619
 can change batteries in 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.350
 usually gives this battery problem 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.110
 spend and schedule with design being more 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.610
 there are people here is not the battery is already a 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.700
 bios defect 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.799

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.960

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.790
 I boot the system here in my 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.790
 virtual machine 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.550
