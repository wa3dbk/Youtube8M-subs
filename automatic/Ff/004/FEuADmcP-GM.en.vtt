00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.969
 hello girls hello everybody then vi 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.630
 I meant that these days I have 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.369
 created new bags for Christmas 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.970
 because maybe some of you will make a 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.279
 Street market 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.500
 I think for Christmas not to do it 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.160
 however I have created some drawings for 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.050
 Christmas 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.179
 I don't know if any of you saw it 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.470
 many have seen the tutorial that 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.540
 I had done a little bit of time ago 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.329
 his customized bags 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.610
 now I don't even have one on hand 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.460
 I'll take it, here's what I'm talking about 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:44.430
 these are practically the bags 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:48.090
 that once opened you can put them there 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.490
 creations and here you find eventually 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.540
 I wrote my site my logo 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.070
 etc. etc. 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:57.930
 I left him the schemes where you could 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:00.030
 download to my site where you could 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.890
 download the scheme and possibly 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.760
 add your logo etc. many 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.979
 of you have done it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.680
 at this point also realized those 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.420
 for Christmas where later the schemes made 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.910
 like this like this 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:18.540
 this one is not only good 

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:20.970
 because red is my printer no 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.940
 prints it perfectly well because I use it 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.320
 cartridges are original and not kimi 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.270
 they were fine 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.790
 the result should come of something 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.290
 of the kind therefore you after the various le 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:38.580
 bendings I leave you the link of the tutorial 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:44.070
 you will find a bag of this more or 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.420
 less if you see here is here to say here 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.080
 it says merry christmas 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.850
 here you can add your logo 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.490
 you can add your name you can 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.290
 put the business card one 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.909
 Once you close you can put the 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.150
 short fiocchettino seems an idea to me 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.580
 pretty nice what else to say 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.770
 when you download the charts and me 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.240
 I recommend the scheme is realized on a 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.129
 sheet a4 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.590
 then the normal printer sheet 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:13.580
 once you print it should 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:16.250
 tell him to the printer 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.080
 print this image on me all 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.060
 sheet ie me at the moment 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.160
 discharge the image poses print it neither 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.410
 printers tells me how many you want 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.330
 these photos I put three on one 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:28.250
 sheet or I'll put 4 or you 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.310
 you only want one when 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:34.550
 I say one fits the page e 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.160
 then practically this will come out 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.350
 only do 23 folds and put on 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:42.380
 a little bit of glue stick exactly 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.480
 this here only on one side is a 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.490
 time it is closed and you will have this is 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.830
 the result 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.660
 but in short, you liked the idea 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.970
 that is useful to you in short 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.230
 flea markets are a nice thing then 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.720
 anyway these bags are me 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.120
 using a lot uses them a lot for the 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.850
 my creations china is afford too 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.550
 other things because it estimates things while 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.170
 having said that don't look at the lipstick 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.240
 because I'm doing a test and I know that 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.050
 this lipstick doesn't look good on me 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.260
 see you next time 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.260
 Hello
