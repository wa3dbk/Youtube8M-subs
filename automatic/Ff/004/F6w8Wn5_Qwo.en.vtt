00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
like oil on water if you educate them

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.040 
like oil on water if you educate them
even<00:01:42.229> for<00:01:42.500> a<00:01:42.530> brief<00:01:42.860> period<00:01:43.070> of<00:01:43.820> time<00:01:43.900> you<00:01:44.900> end

even for a brief period of time you end

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.410 
even for a brief period of time you end
up<00:01:45.229> with<00:01:45.440> what<00:01:45.650> we<00:01:45.770> call<00:01:45.800> an<00:01:46.220> emulsion<00:01:46.610> an

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
up with what we call an emulsion an

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.530 
up with what we call an emulsion an
emulsion<00:01:48.200> is<00:01:48.470> a<00:01:48.500> temporary<00:01:49.040> mixture<00:01:49.760> what<00:01:50.450> has

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:50.540 
emulsion is a temporary mixture what has

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.570 
emulsion is a temporary mixture what has
actually<00:01:50.750> happened<00:01:51.050> here<00:01:51.680> is<00:01:51.830> the<00:01:52.010> naphtha

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:52.580 
actually happened here is the naphtha

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:55.810 
actually happened here is the naphtha
has<00:01:52.790> encapsulated<00:01:53.270> the<00:01:54.080> water<00:01:54.320> and<00:01:54.680> so<00:01:55.610> you've

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
has encapsulated the water and so you've

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.600 
has encapsulated the water and so you've
got<00:01:55.850> a<00:01:56.330> million<00:01:56.780> little<00:01:57.200> bubbles<00:01:57.830> of<00:01:58.100> naphtha

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
got a million little bubbles of naphtha

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.190 
got a million little bubbles of naphtha
and<00:01:58.640> in<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.060> center<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.510> each<00:01:59.690> one<00:01:59.720> is<00:02:00.170> a

droplet<00:02:00.830> of<00:02:00.860> water<00:02:00.950> this<00:02:01.910> particular<00:02:02.570> product

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
droplet of water this particular product

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.380 
droplet of water this particular product
uses<00:02:03.500> a<00:02:03.530> light<00:02:03.890> naphtha<00:02:04.220> and<00:02:04.729> it<00:02:04.940> will<00:02:05.090> start

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
uses a light naphtha and it will start

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.980 
uses a light naphtha and it will start
to<00:02:05.540> break<00:02:05.810> apart<00:02:05.840> fairly<00:02:06.800> rapidly<00:02:07.990> this

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
to break apart fairly rapidly this

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:14.050 
to break apart fairly rapidly this
product<00:02:11.380> uses<00:02:12.380> a<00:02:12.650> heavier<00:02:13.130> weight<00:02:13.400> naphtha

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
product uses a heavier weight naphtha

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.360 
product uses a heavier weight naphtha
and<00:02:14.270> again<00:02:14.959> you<00:02:15.200> get<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.560> same<00:02:15.830> type<00:02:16.340> of

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
and again you get the same type of

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.030 
and again you get the same type of
material<00:02:16.820> you<00:02:17.810> get<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.140> same<00:02:18.410> emulsion<00:02:21.040> our

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
material you get the same emulsion our

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.259 
material you get the same emulsion our
product<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:23.330> terra<00:02:23.630> diesel<00:02:24.110> fuel<00:02:24.470> product

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
product the terra diesel fuel product

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.120 
product the terra diesel fuel product
actually<00:02:26.269> causes<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:26.840> chemical<00:02:27.140> reaction

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
actually causes a chemical reaction

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.630 
actually causes a chemical reaction
between<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.730> water<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:30.620> additive<00:02:31.370> and

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
between the water and the additive and

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.530 
between the water and the additive and
this<00:02:32.570> product<00:02:33.140> will<00:02:33.890> actually<00:02:34.540> totally

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
this product will actually totally

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.699 
this product will actually totally
disperse<00:02:36.140> water<00:02:36.670> so<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:37.880> mix<00:02:38.180> this<00:02:38.530> 50/50<00:02:39.530> with

00:02:39.699 --> 00:02:39.709 
disperse water so we mix this 50/50 with

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:42.009 
disperse water so we mix this 50/50 with
water<00:02:40.040> and<00:02:40.790> with<00:02:40.940> just<00:02:41.150> a<00:02:41.269> tiny<00:02:41.510> bit<00:02:41.840> of

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
water and with just a tiny bit of

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.500 
water and with just a tiny bit of
agitation<00:02:42.590> we<00:02:43.400> have<00:02:43.580> a<00:02:43.610> chemical<00:02:44.180> reaction

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
agitation we have a chemical reaction

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.290 
agitation we have a chemical reaction
that's<00:02:44.930> taken<00:02:45.410> place<00:02:45.680> and<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.730> way<00:02:46.910> that<00:02:47.150> we

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
that's taken place and the way that we

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:55.680 
that's taken place and the way that we
demonstrate<00:02:48.019> this<00:02:48.260> to<00:02:48.470> people

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.230 

so<00:02:56.410> we<00:02:56.500> used<00:02:56.680> a<00:02:56.830> product<00:02:57.130> called<00:02:57.730> water

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 
so we used a product called water

the<00:03:13.300> light<00:03:13.540> naphtha<00:03:14.070> if<00:03:15.070> you<00:03:15.250> go<00:03:15.370> down<00:03:15.580> into<00:03:15.970> it

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
the light naphtha if you go down into it

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.920 
the light naphtha if you go down into it
and<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.250> see<00:03:18.610> that<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.940> water<00:03:19.150> level<00:03:19.750> is

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
and you see that the water level is

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.870 
and you see that the water level is
still<00:03:20.260> very<00:03:20.650> present<00:03:21.070> in<00:03:21.460> there

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
still very present in there

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:35.640 
still very present in there
and<00:03:22.050> you<00:03:23.050> get<00:03:23.230> that<00:03:23.440> very<00:03:23.860> red<00:03:24.340> material<00:03:34.560> if<00:03:35.560> we

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
and you get that very red material if we

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.220 
and you get that very red material if we
go<00:03:35.800> into<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.220> second<00:03:36.640> one<00:03:36.790> here<00:03:37.120> you<00:03:37.870> have<00:03:38.050> to

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
go into the second one here you have to

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:40.410 
go into the second one here you have to
actually<00:03:38.410> push<00:03:39.070> this<00:03:39.280> against<00:03:39.670> the<00:03:39.850> sides<00:03:40.150> of

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
actually push this against the sides of

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.360 
actually push this against the sides of
the<00:03:40.480> glass<00:03:40.750> a<00:03:40.780> little<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.560> break<00:03:41.830> the<00:03:42.160> water

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
the glass a little to break the water

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.820 
the glass a little to break the water
bubbles<00:03:42.910> apart<00:03:43.330> but<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.020> water<00:03:44.260> is<00:03:44.530> still

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
bubbles apart but the water is still

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.100 
bubbles apart but the water is still
very<00:03:45.070> present<00:03:45.520> in<00:03:45.820> there<00:03:46.060> and<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.660> still<00:03:46.930> get

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
very present in there and you still get
