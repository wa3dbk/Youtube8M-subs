the best things to do when you're

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.240 
the best things to do when you're
beginner<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:40.050> to<00:00:40.739> learn<00:00:41.180> about<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.690> bow<00:00:42.840> and

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
beginner is to learn about the bow and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.090 
beginner is to learn about the bow and
tuning<00:00:44.360> because<00:00:45.360> if<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.350> tighten<00:00:46.590> your<00:00:46.890> bow

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
tuning because if you tighten your bow

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.549 
tuning because if you tighten your bow
too<00:00:47.850> tight<00:00:48.530> meaning<00:00:49.640> like<00:00:50.640> this<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.930> you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
too tight meaning like this if you

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.310 
too tight meaning like this if you
tighten<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:53.039> too<00:00:53.309> tight<00:00:53.750> then<00:00:54.750> this<00:00:57.320> your

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
tighten this too tight then this your

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.729 
tighten this too tight then this your
bow<00:00:58.559> stick<00:00:59.070> will<00:00:59.430> become<00:00:59.760> very<00:01:00.059> tight<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.809> it

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
bow stick will become very tight and it

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.840 
bow stick will become very tight and it
can<00:01:01.859> actually<00:01:02.039> warp<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.570> look<00:01:04.110> down

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
can actually warp it so if you look down

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.370 
can actually warp it so if you look down
the<00:01:05.850> center<00:01:06.890> like<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.900> see<00:01:09.900> that<00:01:10.200> it's

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
the center like this and see that it's

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.230 
the center like this and see that it's
bowing<00:01:11.220> out<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> side<00:01:12.840> or<00:01:13.820> if<00:01:14.820> it's<00:01:15.060> not

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
bowing out to the side or if it's not

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.810 
bowing out to the side or if it's not
completely<00:01:15.720> straight<00:01:16.610> usually<00:01:17.610> you've

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
completely straight usually you've

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.230 
completely straight usually you've
tightened<00:01:18.119> it<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.570> twine<00:01:18.869> or<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:20.130> time<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.930> a

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
tightened it to twine or to time and a

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.960 
tightened it to twine or to time and a
good<00:01:24.240> way<00:01:25.110> to<00:01:25.140> tell<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.950> it's<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.340> time<00:01:26.580> if<00:01:26.850> you

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
good way to tell if it's to time if you

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.240 
good way to tell if it's to time if you
can<00:01:27.000> stick<00:01:27.360> your<00:01:27.390> pinky<00:01:27.930> through<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.710> it<00:01:29.009> goes

can stick your pinky through and it goes
straight<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.030> way<00:01:30.270> through<00:01:30.710> then<00:01:31.710> you've

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
straight all the way through then you've

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.969
