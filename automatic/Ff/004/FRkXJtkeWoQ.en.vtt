00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.020
 ah 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.520
 hello sure is I got stuck between 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.470
 letters and I bring you a new section in 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.360
 my channel that is called top 10 of the 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.070
 books that I 'm destined to read but still not 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.320
 I read this section will be changing 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.330
 it depends on the months it's going to be a month a 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.400
 thing one month the other but all referred 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.220
 to the top 10 so I hope you like it 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.500
 the first is what's left of james bond 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.940
 I had only shown them in a but hall and 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.920
 I had told them that I had hardly 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.420
 had had a crush on this 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.610
 book and I was so eager to read it 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.110
 I wanted to start reading it last month 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.210
 but I felt that it was not the moment 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.980
 indicated to start reading it by the 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.720
 theme that has and effort that what 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.670
 I've been postponing but I really have 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.620
 too eager to read it and that's why 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.690
 I put in this top 10 the next book 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.250
 I want to read is Veronica wolf 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.650
 I was murdering this book I bought it the month 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.870
 gone and I have too much desire to 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:01.300
 read it this book is about fantasy 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.220
 epic with dragons swords and all that 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.619
 they already know that I love it and it's 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:08.290
 why I am fascinated by this theme that 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:10.240
 I want to read it already although I can not find the 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.009
 time but I'm sure it's going to be 9 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.960
 the first ones that I'm going to read this month or 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.760
 the month that follows 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.950
 and that's why I put him in this ranking 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.690
 the next thing I want to read is good sense 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.729
 and feelings for jane austen as already 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.560
 I told them pride and prejudice was a 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.970
 very big discovery for me I thought 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.520
 that I was not going to like it at all but 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.930
 jane austen managed to surprise me very much 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.300
 and that's why one of the books that 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.250
 more I feel like reading from her is that 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.690
 thesis feelings apart from that it is very 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.040
 bearable to take into account the 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.630
 context in which this is written 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.729
 history and many people dijieron me 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.950
 what is before that feeling was a book 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.119
 that they loved even more than pride and 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.710
 prejudice and that's why I have so many 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.720
 want to read it the next book I have 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:47.460
 eager to read is Harry Potter and 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.229
 the secret chamber just in case rowling 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.450
 this book is the second book of the 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.190
 saga and as you know I had never given 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.600
 a lot of balls to everything that is the world 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.550
 from harry potter heart the teachers 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.500
 start in the first book and I loved it 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.869
 everyone in which everything is 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.009
 the world of harris let rum mining and 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.509
 that's why one will have to read the 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.039
 second book to see how it continues 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.720
 this story that both managed to trap me 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.880
 the next in the book that I want to read 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.649
 is the name of the wind by patrick wolf 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.569
 your days because this book is the 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.370
 favorite of many people told me 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.560
 which is an epic fantasy that achieves 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.480
 completely pass the prejudices that 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.840
 has the people who manage to surprise 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.390
 much 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.310
 and it's a book that catches you it's because of you 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.290
 people to read it but tucked back a little 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.720
 knowing the size of this book and the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.610
 size of the second book that is double 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.140
 of this and that's why I'm throwing a 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.670
 little back but I really have 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.739
 really want to read it because I 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.480
 I want it is excellent crossed letters 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.220
 for frames to use is another book I have 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.640
 eager to read and that's because 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.930
 that of books is a book that has 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.430
 delighted by his way of writing by 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.440
 his way of catching people who 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.090
 they are reading it and that's why I have so many 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.860
 want to read it apart it is a 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.690
 totally different theme so 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.110
 I want to see how it is that surprises me this 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.049
 Author 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.269
 again insomnia of jrr hanson is a 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:59.069
 book that I really want to read 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.329
 that has a very different theme to 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.150
 what we are used to 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.950
 about dreams and everything that is the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.930
 psychological thriller and that's something that 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.519
 it calls me too much attention but I 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.470
 throw a little back the fact of knowing that 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.090
 it's a trilogy and I do not know when they're going to 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.349
 get the other books and I'm afraid of 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.000
 to stay in the middle of eager to 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:16.410
 keep reading because I know it's going to 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.660
 like a lot for the theme that has 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.310
 tradition by scott westerfeld is another 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.110
 book that I want to read but I 'm not 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.670
 totally safe because there are many 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.270
 varied opinions there are people who 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.710
 they say that 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.120
 at the hands of people who say what 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.950
 they hate and I do not know what effort 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.150
 feelings towards this book and not 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.220
 I know if I want to read 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.720
 but I really know it's a book that I 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.970
 you can draw attention and effort 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.350
 I'm so eager to read it while 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.940
 I think these form delight of your the 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.620
 what is a book that was waiting 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.420
 for a long time and I was a long time 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.310
 saving to be able to buy melon and it's 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.260
 that this book is that in life goes to 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.260
 achieve to surprise is a link of beauty 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.450
 sleeper that is a past history 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.400
 the one in your mind but it's set in 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.930
 the current time that's something that calls me 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.100
 very much attention and I have so much 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.870
 people read what I can not even 

00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.090
 explain I'm trying to do in a 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.030
 time to read it and that's why 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.070
 that I put it in the top 10 the last book 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.530
 of this top 10 is shadow city case 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.540
 of bone this book is pretty much a 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.950
 cheat because that they had already read it was 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.150
 the first saga that I read after 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.910
 'twilight' that was a book that 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.650
 introduced in the in the reading but what 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.780
 I want to reread goes in cycle to perform 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.610
 the whole saga because I forgot almost 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.290
 all the details up to the important ones 

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:24.480
 and that's why I think I have to 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.180
 give this book a try and the 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.440
 others to be able to know more or less how 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.849
 follow this story because I stayed in the 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.189
 book 4 then 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.749
 but the first one for this is 

00:04:32.189 --> 00:04:35.099
 start so well that was all 

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:36.689
 I hope you liked this new 

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:38.219
