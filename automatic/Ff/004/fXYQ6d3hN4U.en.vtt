I friend in this video we're going to
cover<00:00:02.879> how<00:00:03.799> using<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.890> bowling<00:00:05.130> machine<00:00:05.460> too

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
cover how using a bowling machine too

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.660 
cover how using a bowling machine too
much<00:00:06.270> can<00:00:06.660> turn<00:00:06.930> you<00:00:07.109> into<00:00:07.290> a<00:00:07.440> robotic<00:00:08.010> kind<00:00:08.550> of

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
much can turn you into a robotic kind of

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.910 
much can turn you into a robotic kind of
player<00:00:08.910> it<00:00:09.480> can<00:00:09.540> actually<00:00:09.840> spoil<00:00:10.500> your

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
player it can actually spoil your

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.030 
player it can actually spoil your
batting<00:00:11.429> game<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.000> how<00:00:12.540> I<00:00:12.570> think<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.259> sidearm

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
batting game and how I think a sidearm

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:24.849 
batting game and how I think a sidearm
or<00:00:14.309> throw<00:00:15.000> downs<00:00:15.299> are<00:00:15.509> considerably<00:00:16.139> better

something<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:30.599> I'm<00:00:30.720> seeing<00:00:31.019> more<00:00:31.320> and<00:00:31.470> more

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
something that I'm seeing more and more

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.770 
something that I'm seeing more and more
from<00:00:31.920> coaches<00:00:32.489> and<00:00:33.030> something<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.630> I'm

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
from coaches and something that I'm

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.680 
from coaches and something that I'm
seeing<00:00:34.399> happening<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.550> players<00:00:35.880> as<00:00:36.180> a<00:00:36.300> result

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
seeing happening to players as a result

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.680 
seeing happening to players as a result
of<00:00:36.870> using<00:00:37.079> bowling<00:00:37.710> machines<00:00:38.129> too<00:00:38.489> much<00:00:38.760> don't

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
of using bowling machines too much don't

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.420 
of using bowling machines too much don't
get<00:00:39.809> me<00:00:39.930> wrong<00:00:39.960> I<00:00:40.290> like<00:00:40.620> barn<00:00:40.890> machines<00:00:41.250> and<00:00:41.370> I

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
get me wrong I like barn machines and I

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.979 
get me wrong I like barn machines and I
think<00:00:41.640> bowling<00:00:41.969> machines<00:00:42.300> are<00:00:42.450> great<00:00:42.690> and<00:00:42.930> I

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
think bowling machines are great and I

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.380 
think bowling machines are great and I
think<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.320> best<00:00:43.620> time<00:00:44.010> for<00:00:44.399> any<00:00:44.610> cricketer<00:00:45.210> to

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
think the best time for any cricketer to

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.880 
think the best time for any cricketer to
be<00:00:45.480> using<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.870> bowling<00:00:46.200> machine<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.620> in<00:00:46.770> the

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
be using a bowling machine is in the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.910 
be using a bowling machine is in the
winter<00:00:47.340> I<00:00:47.520> also<00:00:48.180> think<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:48.960> club<00:00:49.289> cricketers

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
winter I also think for club cricketers

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.850 
winter I also think for club cricketers
they<00:00:50.250> are<00:00:50.460> an<00:00:50.610> invaluable<00:00:51.289> training<00:00:52.289> aid<00:00:52.649> at

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
they are an invaluable training aid at

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.619 
they are an invaluable training aid at
the<00:00:52.949> beginning<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.640> season<00:00:53.879> when<00:00:54.360> a

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the beginning of the season when a

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.350 
the beginning of the season when a
player<00:00:55.260> hasn't<00:00:55.949> faced<00:00:56.399> many<00:00:56.670> balls<00:00:56.969> over<00:00:57.270> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
player hasn't faced many balls over the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.630 
player hasn't faced many balls over the
winter<00:00:57.690> and<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.289> need<00:00:58.620> lots<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.399> red

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
winter and you just need lots of red

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.340 
winter and you just need lots of red
things<00:00:59.910> coming<00:01:00.420> at<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.719> and<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.020> could<00:01:01.199> go

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
things coming at you and that could go

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.439 
things coming at you and that could go
for<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.590> keeper<00:01:02.070> as<00:01:02.190> well<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.969> think<00:01:03.239> they're

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
for a keeper as well and I think they're

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.990 
for a keeper as well and I think they're
great<00:01:03.660> in<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.320> situation<00:01:05.129> but<00:01:05.280> something

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
great in that situation but something

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.370 
great in that situation but something
that<00:01:06.150> I'm<00:01:06.270> seeing<00:01:06.510> happening<00:01:06.930> more<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.200> more

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
that I'm seeing happening more and more

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.200 
that I'm seeing happening more and more
with<00:01:07.680> young<00:01:07.950> players<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.580> they<00:01:08.760> are<00:01:08.880> turning

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
with young players is they are turning

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.810 
with young players is they are turning
into<00:01:09.510> robots<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.350> they<00:01:11.130> are<00:01:11.250> turning<00:01:11.549> into

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
into robots and they are turning into

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.760 
into robots and they are turning into
front<00:01:12.180> foot<00:01:12.420> bullies<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:12.930> you<00:01:13.049> can<00:01:13.200> see<00:01:13.530> when

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
front foot bullies and you can see when

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.380 
front foot bullies and you can see when
they<00:01:13.920> play<00:01:14.189> they're<00:01:14.400> always<00:01:14.610> going<00:01:15.060> onto<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
they play they're always going onto the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.060 
they play they're always going onto the
front<00:01:15.750> foot<00:01:15.990> they're<00:01:16.140> always<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.650> onto<00:01:16.860> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
front foot they're always going onto the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.730 
front foot they're always going onto the
front<00:01:17.369> foot<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.119> reason<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.840> I<00:01:18.869> think<00:01:19.259> is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
front foot and the reason is I think is

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.249 
front foot and the reason is I think is
because<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.759> coaches<00:01:21.090> that's<00:01:21.720> been<00:01:21.960> working

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
because the coaches that's been working

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.590 
because the coaches that's been working
with<00:01:22.619> those<00:01:22.799> players<00:01:23.130> has<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.909> been<00:01:24.119> doing<00:01:24.479> a

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
with those players has just been doing a

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.249 
with those players has just been doing a
lot<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:24.869> front<00:01:25.290> foot<00:01:25.590> drives<00:01:25.979> which<00:01:26.700> is<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.259> shot

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
lot of front foot drives which is a shot

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.440 
lot of front foot drives which is a shot
that<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.560> coach<00:01:28.890> likes<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:29.820> lot<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
that a coach likes to see a lot and

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.590 
that a coach likes to see a lot and
that's<00:01:30.990> actually<00:01:31.439> not<00:01:31.740> doing<00:01:32.250> any<00:01:32.549> good<00:01:32.909> to

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
that's actually not doing any good to

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.109 
that's actually not doing any good to
the<00:01:33.720> player<00:01:34.020> I'm<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.159> firm<00:01:35.430> believer<00:01:35.820> in

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
the player I'm on the firm believer in

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.250 
the player I'm on the firm believer in
you've<00:01:36.659> got<00:01:36.689> to<00:01:37.049> switch<00:01:37.439> things<00:01:37.740> up<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> do<00:01:38.280> if

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
you've got to switch things up and do if

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.030 
you've got to switch things up and do if
also<00:01:40.010> do<00:01:40.280> what's<00:01:40.550> hard<00:01:41.330> for<00:01:41.720> a<00:01:42.290> plan<00:01:42.560> not<00:01:42.860> the

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
also do what's hard for a plan not the

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.070 
also do what's hard for a plan not the
easy<00:01:43.250> stuff<00:01:43.700> in<00:01:43.970> order<00:01:44.120> for<00:01:44.420> that<00:01:44.540> player<00:01:44.840> to

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:45.080 
easy stuff in order for that player to

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.680 
easy stuff in order for that player to
improve<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.800> I<00:01:46.370> see<00:01:46.730> a<00:01:46.760> lot<00:01:47.060> with<00:01:47.240> bowling

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
improve and I see a lot with bowling

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.390 
improve and I see a lot with bowling
machines<00:01:48.050> that<00:01:48.320> people<00:01:48.500> are<00:01:48.830> kind<00:01:49.040> of<00:01:49.130> just

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:49.400 
machines that people are kind of just

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.860 
machines that people are kind of just
they're<00:01:49.580> turning<00:01:49.820> into<00:01:50.060> robots

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
they're turning into robots

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.920 
they're turning into robots
I<00:01:50.900> prefer<00:01:51.710> the<00:01:52.220> sidearm<00:01:52.580> I<00:01:52.970> prefer<00:01:53.420> the<00:01:53.630> thrown

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
I prefer the sidearm I prefer the thrown

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.320 
I prefer the sidearm I prefer the thrown
out<00:01:54.230> I<00:01:54.470> think<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.040> sidearm<00:01:55.310> is<00:01:55.610> a<00:01:55.670> great<00:01:55.970> tool

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
out I think the sidearm is a great tool

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.690 
out I think the sidearm is a great tool
because<00:01:56.900> it<00:01:57.020> basically<00:01:57.170> saves<00:01:57.770> my<00:01:58.100> arm<00:01:58.340> as<00:01:58.640> a

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
because it basically saves my arm as a

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.080 
because it basically saves my arm as a
coach<00:01:59.150> and<00:01:59.510> there's<00:02:00.470> this<00:02:00.800> good<00:02:01.100> variation<00:02:01.550> of

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
coach and there's this good variation of

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.210 
coach and there's this good variation of
that<00:02:02.150> sidearm<00:02:02.750> especially<00:02:03.590> the<00:02:03.710> pro<00:02:03.950> version

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
that sidearm especially the pro version

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.160 
that sidearm especially the pro version
which<00:02:04.550> is<00:02:04.730> ridiculous<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.630> speed<00:02:05.960> at<00:02:06.140> which

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
which is ridiculous the speed at which

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.650 
which is ridiculous the speed at which
it<00:02:06.500> comes<00:02:06.710> off<00:02:07.010> the<00:02:07.550> surface<00:02:08.000> is<00:02:08.150> great<00:02:08.450> it

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
it comes off the surface is great it

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.330 
it comes off the surface is great it
really<00:02:08.990> makes<00:02:09.230> the<00:02:09.410> batsman<00:02:09.830> have<00:02:09.980> to<00:02:10.130> watch

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
really makes the batsman have to watch

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.300 
really makes the batsman have to watch
the<00:02:10.580> ball<00:02:10.900> and<00:02:11.900> it's<00:02:12.050> really<00:02:12.530> lifelike<00:02:12.950> and

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
the ball and it's really lifelike and

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.700 
the ball and it's really lifelike and
the<00:02:14.030> closer<00:02:14.360> I<00:02:14.540> get<00:02:14.900> to<00:02:14.960> my<00:02:15.200> player<00:02:15.500> would

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
the closer I get to my player would

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.610 
the closer I get to my player would
decide<00:02:16.070> on<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:17.180> more<00:02:17.390> accurate<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:17.990> become<00:02:18.440> and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
decide on the more accurate I become and

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.860 
decide on the more accurate I become and
I<00:02:18.710> prefer<00:02:19.160> that<00:02:19.400> because<00:02:19.580> that<00:02:19.970> variance<00:02:20.630> is

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
I prefer that because that variance is

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.810 
I prefer that because that variance is
more<00:02:21.290> like<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.770> variance<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.490> player

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
more like the variance that a player

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.850 
more like the variance that a player
will<00:02:23.090> have<00:02:23.270> when<00:02:23.810> they're<00:02:24.020> playing<00:02:24.290> on<00:02:24.530> grass

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
will have when they're playing on grass

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.550 
will have when they're playing on grass
wicket<00:02:25.450> it's<00:02:26.450> more<00:02:26.750> like<00:02:26.930> the<00:02:27.110> variance<00:02:27.500> that

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
wicket it's more like the variance that

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.380 
wicket it's more like the variance that
a<00:02:27.740> player<00:02:27.980> will<00:02:28.010> have<00:02:28.430> to<00:02:28.580> deal<00:02:28.820> with<00:02:28.850> as<00:02:29.240> the

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
a player will have to deal with as the

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.480 
a player will have to deal with as the
ball<00:02:29.600> gets<00:02:29.900> older<00:02:30.410> it's<00:02:30.890> more<00:02:31.160> like<00:02:31.370> the

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
ball gets older it's more like the

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.890 
ball gets older it's more like the
variance<00:02:31.850> that<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.180> player<00:02:32.390> will<00:02:32.570> have<00:02:32.720> to

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
variance that the player will have to

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.440 
variance that the player will have to
deal<00:02:33.170> with<00:02:33.310> as<00:02:34.310> the<00:02:34.550> bowler<00:02:34.760> Bowls<00:02:35.090> lower

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
deal with as the bowler Bowls lower

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.690 
deal with as the bowler Bowls lower

swingers away swingers and all that kind

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.790 
swingers away swingers and all that kind
of<00:02:39.950> thing<00:02:40.300> so<00:02:41.300> this<00:02:41.450> is<00:02:41.660> just<00:02:41.810> my<00:02:42.110> this<00:02:42.170> isn't<00:02:42.710> a

this<00:02:43.550> is<00:02:43.700> just<00:02:43.910> my<00:02:44.060> opinion<00:02:44.660> and<00:02:44.690> I've<00:02:45.140> been

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
this is just my opinion and I've been

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.990 
this is just my opinion and I've been
coaching<00:02:45.500> for<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.860> few<00:02:46.100> years<00:02:46.310> now<00:02:46.490> but<00:02:46.520> I<00:02:46.760> think

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
coaching for a few years now but I think

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.970 
coaching for a few years now but I think
I'm<00:02:47.090> pretty<00:02:47.300> right<00:02:47.540> on<00:02:47.750> this<00:02:47.990> but<00:02:48.290> I'll<00:02:48.680> be

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
I'm pretty right on this but I'll be

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.160 
I'm pretty right on this but I'll be
happy<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.370> hear<00:02:49.790> other<00:02:50.090> people's<00:02:50.180> opinions<00:02:50.660> I

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
happy to hear other people's opinions I

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.420 
happy to hear other people's opinions I
don't<00:02:51.530> get<00:02:51.680> me<00:02:51.800> right<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:51.980> don't<00:02:52.160> dislike

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
don't get me right I don't dislike

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.820 
don't get me right I don't dislike
bowling<00:02:53.030> machines<00:02:53.360> but<00:02:53.570> I<00:02:53.600> like<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.350> I<00:02:54.410> prefer

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
bowling machines but I like and I prefer

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:58.600 
bowling machines but I like and I prefer
the<00:02:55.130> variance<00:02:55.970> of<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.920> sidearm<00:02:57.920> and<00:02:58.130> throwdowns

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
the variance of a sidearm and throwdowns

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.060 
the variance of a sidearm and throwdowns
more<00:02:59.000> because<00:02:59.420> I<00:02:59.450> think<00:02:59.600> as<00:02:59.959> players<00:03:00.680> need

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
more because I think as players need

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:02.800 
more because I think as players need
that<00:03:01.370> because<00:03:02.030> you<00:03:02.150> never<00:03:02.360> know<00:03:02.600> what's

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
that because you never know what's

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.600 
that because you never know what's
coming<00:03:03.140> in<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.260> game<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:03.830> I<00:03:03.950> think<00:03:04.010> it<00:03:04.580> just

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
coming in the game and I think it just

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.210 
coming in the game and I think it just
keeps<00:03:05.150> helps<00:03:05.570> to<00:03:05.750> keep<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:06.140> player<00:03:06.380> on<00:03:06.680> it

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
keeps helps to keep a player on it

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.100 
keeps helps to keep a player on it
