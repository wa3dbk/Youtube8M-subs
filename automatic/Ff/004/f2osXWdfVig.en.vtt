in some way

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.860 
in some way
it's<00:02:09.829> autonomous<00:02:10.340> it<00:02:11.030> has<00:02:11.150> sensors<00:02:11.540> in<00:02:11.570> there

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
it's autonomous it has sensors in there

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.039 
it's autonomous it has sensors in there
that<00:02:12.170> give<00:02:12.350> it<00:02:12.579> awareness<00:02:13.579> of<00:02:13.850> space<00:02:13.970> and<00:02:14.450> so

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:15.049 
that give it awareness of space and so

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.830 
that give it awareness of space and so
all<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.620> need<00:02:15.799> to<00:02:15.860> do<00:02:16.160> is<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.269> flick<00:02:17.540> it<00:02:17.570> in<00:02:17.720> the

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
all you need to do is to flick it in the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.710 
all you need to do is to flick it in the
direction<00:02:18.250> it's<00:02:19.250> gonna<00:02:19.370> go<00:02:19.579> there<00:02:19.820> take<00:02:20.690> a

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
direction it's gonna go there take a

we also see this as the natural
evolution<00:03:26.140> of<00:03:26.560> photography<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:27.790> cameras<00:03:28.240> were

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
evolution of photography so cameras were

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.030 
evolution of photography so cameras were
initially<00:03:28.720> really<00:03:28.960> big<00:03:29.170> they<00:03:29.440> were<00:03:29.530> manual

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
initially really big they were manual

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.090 
initially really big they were manual
you<00:03:30.730> had<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:31.180> work<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.780> know<00:03:32.140> how<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.590> use<00:03:32.830> them

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
you had to work and know how to use them

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.430 
you had to work and know how to use them
then<00:03:33.730> you<00:03:33.850> had<00:03:34.000> auto<00:03:34.270> exposure<00:03:34.690> you<00:03:35.080> had<00:03:35.230> auto

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
then you had auto exposure you had auto

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.020 
then you had auto exposure you had auto
focus<00:03:35.950> cameras<00:03:36.340> got<00:03:36.490> lighter<00:03:36.700> and<00:03:36.910> smaller

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
focus cameras got lighter and smaller

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.030 
focus cameras got lighter and smaller
and<00:03:37.360> more<00:03:37.450> portable<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:38.530> what<00:03:38.680> we're<00:03:38.860> offering

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
here is auto composition right auto

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.890 
here is auto composition right auto
