grate your ginger you're going to take
your<00:01:25.380> zester<00:01:25.770> or<00:01:25.799> microplane<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.900> when<00:01:27.900> doing

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
your zester or microplane and when doing

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.289 
your zester or microplane and when doing
this<00:01:28.290> it's<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.650> lot<00:01:28.799> easier<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.490> your<00:01:29.790> ginger

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
this it's a lot easier if your ginger

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.030 
this it's a lot easier if your ginger
your<00:01:30.479> piece<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.810> fresh<00:01:30.990> ginger<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.530> frozen

your piece of fresh ginger is frozen

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.620 
your piece of fresh ginger is frozen

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
because it makes the fibers a lot harder

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.390 
because it makes the fibers a lot harder
so<00:01:33.960> then<00:01:34.590> you're<00:01:34.710> going<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:34.860> take<00:01:35.040> your<00:01:35.189> fresh
