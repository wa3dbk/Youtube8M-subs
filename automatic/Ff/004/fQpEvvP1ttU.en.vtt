biceps quickly alright and this is
called<00:00:31.640> negatives<00:00:32.640> alright<00:00:33.300> I'm<00:00:33.510> not<00:00:33.690> talking

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
called negatives alright I'm not talking

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.690 
called negatives alright I'm not talking
about<00:00:34.200> just<00:00:34.380> the<00:00:34.770> general<00:00:35.010> time<00:00:35.430> under

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
about just the general time under

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.220 
about just the general time under
tension<00:00:35.730> where<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.390> use<00:00:36.540> a<00:00:36.570> lighter<00:00:36.960> weight

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
tension where you use a lighter weight

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.950 
tension where you use a lighter weight
and<00:00:37.469> focus<00:00:38.129> on<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.309> slow<00:00:38.670> negative<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.510> then

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
and focus on a slow negative and then

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.330 
and focus on a slow negative and then
lifting<00:00:40.320> the<00:00:40.410> weight<00:00:40.559> again<00:00:40.829> I'm<00:00:40.950> talking

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
lifting the weight again I'm talking

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.760 
lifting the weight again I'm talking
about<00:00:41.550> using<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:42.090> heavier<00:00:42.510> weight<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.559> you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
about using a heavier weight that you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.529 
about using a heavier weight that you
can<00:00:43.950> hardly<00:00:44.600> curl<00:00:45.770> and<00:00:47.120> focusing<00:00:48.120> on<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
can hardly curl and focusing on the

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.660 
can hardly curl and focusing on the
negative<00:00:48.989> aspect<00:00:49.590> of<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.890> we<00:00:50.010> all<00:00:50.160> know<00:00:50.430> that

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
negative aspect of it we all know that

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.689 
negative aspect of it we all know that
we<00:00:51.090> are<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.270> lot<00:00:51.570> stronger<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.350> we<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.559> carry<00:00:53.370> a

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
we are a lot stronger and we can carry a

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.900 
we are a lot stronger and we can carry a
lot<00:00:54.360> larger<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:55.050> load<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> way<00:00:56.399> down<00:00:56.640> of

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
lot larger of a load on the way down of

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.569 
lot larger of a load on the way down of
practically<00:00:57.899> any<00:00:58.199> movement<00:00:58.920> alright<00:00:59.460> and

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
practically any movement alright and

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.490 
practically any movement alright and
this<00:00:59.670> is<00:00:59.850> important<00:01:00.359> for<00:01:00.600> overloading<00:01:01.260> the

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
this is important for overloading the

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.709 
this is important for overloading the
muscle<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:01.980> muscle<00:01:02.010> damage<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.940> order<00:01:03.539> to

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
muscle and muscle damage in order to

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.179 
muscle and muscle damage in order to
build<00:01:03.870> sighs<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.559> what<00:01:04.710> I'm<00:01:04.799> going<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:04.949> show

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
build sighs so what I'm going to show

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.060 
build sighs so what I'm going to show
you<00:01:05.250> here<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.850> way<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.659> perform<00:01:07.590> negatives

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
you here is a way to perform negatives

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.510 
you here is a way to perform negatives
on<00:01:08.250> your<00:01:08.520> biceps<00:01:09.380> without<00:01:10.380> having<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.979> spotter

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
on your biceps without having a spotter

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
do is use a weight that you can curl but

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.609 
do is use a weight that you can curl but
it's<00:01:17.130> actually<00:01:17.369> pretty<00:01:18.150> heavy<00:01:18.509> relative<00:01:19.409> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
do is add yourself and lifting it up

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.929 
do is add yourself and lifting it up
with<00:01:24.750> your<00:01:24.960> free<00:01:25.229> arm<00:01:25.470> and<00:01:25.680> then<00:01:26.009> focusing<00:01:26.729> on

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
with your free arm and then focusing on

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.249 
with your free arm and then focusing on
trying<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:28.290> hold<00:01:28.979> the<00:01:29.250> weight<00:01:29.460> still<00:01:29.939> as<00:01:30.259> it

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
trying to hold the weight still as it

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.310 
trying to hold the weight still as it
kind<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.890> pulls<00:01:32.250> you<00:01:32.549> down<00:01:33.200> with<00:01:34.200> the

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
kind of just pulls you down with the

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.929 
kind of just pulls you down with the
resistance<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.070> what<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.520> going<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:35.700> do

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
resistance and what this is going to do

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.999 
resistance and what this is going to do
again<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.600> break<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.259> muscle<00:01:37.680> down<00:01:37.829> and

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
again is break that muscle down and

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.100 
again is break that muscle down and
allow<00:01:38.159> you<00:01:38.220> to<00:01:38.460> load<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.240> muscle<00:01:39.750> up<00:01:39.869> with

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
allow you to load that muscle up with

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.170 
allow you to load that muscle up with
much<00:01:40.380> heavier<00:01:41.130> workload<00:01:41.610> than<00:01:41.790> you<00:01:41.909> would

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
much heavier workload than you would

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.649 
much heavier workload than you would
with<00:01:42.420> a<00:01:43.020> basic<00:01:43.829> curl<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.399> thus<00:01:45.030> help<00:01:45.420> you

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
with a basic curl and thus help you

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.990 
with a basic curl and thus help you
build<00:01:46.170> size<00:01:46.590> now<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.610> end-all

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
build size now this is not the end-all

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.139 
build size now this is not the end-all
be-all<00:01:48.170> to<00:01:49.170> building<00:01:49.770> muscle<00:01:49.799> size<00:01:50.340> but<00:01:51.000> it's

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
be-all to building muscle size but it's

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.080 
be-all to building muscle size but it's
actually<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.810> point<00:01:52.530> or<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> type<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.820> training

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
actually a point or a type of training

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.600 
actually a point or a type of training
that<00:01:54.270> you<00:01:54.420> should<00:01:54.750> implement<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.560> you<00:01:56.310> want<00:01:56.520> to

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
that you should implement if you want to
