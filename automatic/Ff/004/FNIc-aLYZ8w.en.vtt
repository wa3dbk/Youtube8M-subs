00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
power is there but but it was working a

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:58.110 
power is there but but it was working a
second<00:01:48.039> ago<00:01:48.189> it<00:01:48.520> was<00:01:48.729> working

Carrie<00:01:58.750> I<00:01:59.170> use<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.130> court<00:02:00.340> at<00:02:00.520> it

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.580 

you<00:02:05.480> know

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
you know

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:16.410 
you know
ok

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.760 

right<00:02:17.420> now<00:02:17.510> all<00:02:17.660> right<00:02:17.690> I<00:02:18.050> am<00:02:18.290> trying<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.680> get

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
right now all right I am trying to get

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.820 
right now all right I am trying to get
the<00:02:18.920> livery<00:02:19.220> they<00:02:19.400> tried<00:02:19.760> up<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.300> running<00:02:20.830> I

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
the livery they tried up and running I

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:23.590 
the livery they tried up and running I
decided<00:02:22.490> when<00:02:22.700> I<00:02:22.760> looked<00:02:23.000> at<00:02:23.120> the<00:02:23.210> idea<00:02:23.360> of

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:23.600 
decided when I looked at the idea of

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.970 
decided when I looked at the idea of
power<00:02:23.810> wheels<00:02:24.050> racing<00:02:24.530> that<00:02:24.650> I'm<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.860> little

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
power wheels racing that I'm a little

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.250 
power wheels racing that I'm a little
too<00:02:25.220> big<00:02:25.340> for<00:02:25.520> every<00:02:25.970> Power<00:02:26.180> Wheels<00:02:26.450> car<00:02:26.870> made

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
too big for every Power Wheels car made

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.380 
too big for every Power Wheels car made
so<00:02:28.190> I<00:02:28.220> took<00:02:28.340> the<00:02:28.520> smallest<00:02:29.000> when<00:02:29.150> we<00:02:29.240> could

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
so I took the smallest when we could

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.440 
so I took the smallest when we could
find<00:02:29.660> which<00:02:29.870> is<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.230> little<00:02:31.010> pink<00:02:31.220> trike<00:02:31.580> and

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
find which is the little pink trike and

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.290 
find which is the little pink trike and
decided<00:02:32.960> to<00:02:32.990> make<00:02:33.140> it<00:02:33.260> big<00:02:33.410> enough<00:02:33.500> for<00:02:33.800> me<00:02:34.300> so

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
decided to make it big enough for me so

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.930 
decided to make it big enough for me so
we<00:02:35.570> have<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> lawn<00:02:36.410> tractor<00:02:36.760> transmission<00:02:37.760> and

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
we have a lawn tractor transmission and

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.360 
we have a lawn tractor transmission and
lawn<00:02:38.210> tractor<00:02:38.720> tires<00:02:39.020> on<00:02:39.320> the<00:02:39.470> back<00:02:39.620> which

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
lawn tractor tires on the back which

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.610 
lawn tractor tires on the back which
gives<00:02:40.640> me<00:02:40.760> five<00:02:41.030> forward<00:02:41.420> speeds<00:02:41.690> one<00:02:42.320> reverse

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
gives me five forward speeds one reverse

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:46.390 
gives me five forward speeds one reverse
plus<00:02:42.980> neutral<00:02:43.990> 24<00:02:44.990> volts<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.590> winch<00:02:46.100> motor

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
plus neutral 24 volts a winch motor

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400 
plus neutral 24 volts a winch motor
which<00:02:46.820> kind<00:02:47.300> of<00:02:47.390> goes<00:02:47.540> a<00:02:47.600> little<00:02:47.840> bit<00:02:48.020> too<00:02:48.170> fast

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
which kind of goes a little bit too fast

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.160 
which kind of goes a little bit too fast
and<00:02:48.830> a<00:02:49.820> steel<00:02:50.120> frame<00:02:50.360> to<00:02:50.570> support<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:51.050> whole

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
and a steel frame to support the whole

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.710 
and a steel frame to support the whole
thing<00:02:51.410> the<00:02:52.370> only<00:02:52.640> good<00:02:52.790> news<00:02:52.850> is<00:02:53.030> i<00:02:53.270> actually

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
thing the only good news is i actually

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.810 
thing the only good news is i actually
have<00:02:53.900> a<00:02:54.170> break<00:02:54.470> hooked<00:02:54.890> into<00:02:55.010> my<00:02:55.160> transmission

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
have a break hooked into my transmission

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.240 
have a break hooked into my transmission
so<00:02:56.180> maybe<00:02:57.110> i<00:02:57.230> will<00:02:57.350> live<00:02:57.680> through<00:02:57.920> the<00:02:57.980> first

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
so maybe i will live through the first

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.240 
so maybe i will live through the first
run<00:02:58.490> maybe<00:02:59.300> not<00:02:59.710> can<00:03:00.710> you<00:03:00.770> go<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.010> pull<00:03:01.220> that

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
run maybe not can you go and pull that

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.760 
run maybe not can you go and pull that
break<00:03:01.580> again<00:03:01.820> for<00:03:02.060> me<00:03:02.150> sure<00:03:03.640> that's<00:03:04.640> my<00:03:04.880> break

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:05.770 
break again for me sure that's my break

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.160 
break again for me sure that's my break
got<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:06.890> kind<00:03:07.340> of<00:03:07.460> wonky<00:03:07.730> goofy<00:03:08.570> but<00:03:08.810> that's

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
got it kind of wonky goofy but that's

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:24.340 
got it kind of wonky goofy but that's
not<00:03:09.290> great

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
vehicle repaired gonna have access to 24

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.850 
vehicle repaired gonna have access to 24
volts<00:04:15.780> even<00:04:16.080> when<00:04:16.230> you<00:04:16.290> try<00:04:16.320> not<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.710> use<00:04:16.830> it

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:16.860 
volts even when you try not to use it

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:18.620 
volts even when you try not to use it
for<00:04:17.040> this<00:04:17.250> endurance<00:04:17.730> race<00:04:17.970> we<00:04:18.210> got<00:04:18.330> to<00:04:18.420> go<00:04:18.480> for

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
for this endurance race we got to go for

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.860 
for this endurance race we got to go for
an<00:04:18.750> hour<00:04:19.040> i<00:04:20.040> soldered<00:04:21.000> some<00:04:21.150> extensions<00:04:21.600> on<00:04:21.750> my

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
an hour i soldered some extensions on my

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.420 
an hour i soldered some extensions on my
steering<00:04:22.140> wheel<00:04:22.320> so<00:04:22.620> it<00:04:22.710> makes<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:22.950> easier<00:04:23.370> to

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
steering wheel so it makes it easier to

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.360 
steering wheel so it makes it easier to
turn<00:04:23.700> let<00:04:24.330> me<00:04:24.450> stay<00:04:24.660> in<00:04:24.690> there<00:04:24.840> East<00:04:24.990> longer

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
turn let me stay in there East longer

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.649 
turn let me stay in there East longer
see<00:04:26.370> how<00:04:26.460> it<00:04:26.610> goes<00:04:26.760> very<00:04:27.210> good<00:04:27.390> no<00:04:27.600> more
