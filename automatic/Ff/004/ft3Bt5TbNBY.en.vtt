for<00:03:51.150> time<00:03:51.330> purposes<00:03:51.510> i<00:03:51.930> went<00:03:52.140> ahead<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.470> i<00:03:52.680> did

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
for time purposes i went ahead and i did

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.220 
for time purposes i went ahead and i did
this<00:03:53.070> one<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.670> just<00:03:54.120> work<00:03:54.450> on<00:03:54.600> the<00:03:54.840> other<00:03:54.870> one

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
this one and just work on the other one

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.170 
this one and just work on the other one
so<00:03:55.710> what<00:03:55.830> you<00:03:55.980> want<00:03:56.160> to<00:03:56.280> do<00:03:56.370> is<00:03:56.490> to<00:03:56.670> take<00:03:56.910> the

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
so what you want to do is to take the

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.600 
so what you want to do is to take the
bun<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:57.840> don't<00:03:58.350> worry<00:03:58.500> about<00:03:58.620> the<00:03:59.070> ends<00:03:59.460> that

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
bun and don't worry about the ends that

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:03.050 
bun and don't worry about the ends that
are<00:03:59.640> sticking<00:04:00.060> out<00:04:00.390> can<00:04:01.260> fix<00:04:01.740> this<00:04:01.920> after<00:04:02.490> go

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
are sticking out can fix this after go

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.650 
are sticking out can fix this after go
ahead<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.750> wrap<00:04:03.990> it<00:04:04.230> around

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.270 

something<00:04:07.050> like<00:04:07.200> this<00:04:07.470> and<00:04:07.770> then<00:04:07.980> you<00:04:08.100> could

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
something like this and then you could

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.230 
something like this and then you could
twist<00:04:09.710> here<00:04:10.710> so<00:04:11.190> that<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.400> rubber<00:04:11.730> band<00:04:12.000> is<00:04:12.210> a

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:12.240 
twist here so that the rubber band is a

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.050 
twist here so that the rubber band is a
bad<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.110> then<00:04:13.590> all<00:04:13.860> you<00:04:13.980> have<00:04:14.130> to<00:04:14.370> do<00:04:14.520> is<00:04:14.700> to<00:04:14.910> go

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
bad and then all you have to do is to go

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.690 
bad and then all you have to do is to go
ahead<00:04:15.300> and<00:04:16.170> secure<00:04:16.530> with<00:04:17.280> your<00:04:17.580> pins<00:04:21.290> and

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
ahead and secure with your pins and

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.960 
ahead and secure with your pins and
voila<00:04:23.700> you<00:04:24.540> are<00:04:24.720> done<00:04:24.990> this<00:04:25.770> is<00:04:26.040> the<00:04:26.340> completed

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
voila you are done this is the completed
