00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
get the wheel on tour it says P reserved

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.320 
get the wheel on tour it says P reserved
so<00:02:44.230> you<00:02:44.320> marks<00:02:44.590> exactly<00:02:44.739> at<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.400> Edit<00:02:45.730> you're

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
so you marks exactly at the Edit you're

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.820 
so you marks exactly at the Edit you're
a<00:02:46.360> look<00:02:46.540> on<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:46.720> other<00:02:46.810> side<00:02:47.170> and<00:02:47.560> there<00:02:47.739> will

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
a look on the other side and there will

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.699 
a look on the other side and there will
be<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:48.340> little<00:02:49.060> circle<00:02:49.570> all<00:02:50.020> you<00:02:50.260> have<00:02:50.380> to<00:02:50.440> do<00:02:50.560> is

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
be a little circle all you have to do is

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.250 
be a little circle all you have to do is
double<00:02:51.100> tap<00:02:51.220> X<00:02:51.550> for<00:02:51.940> Batman<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.330> glide<00:02:52.630> out<00:02:52.660> and

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
double tap X for Batman to glide out and

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.910 
double tap X for Batman to glide out and
just<00:02:53.650> glide<00:02:53.830> straight<00:02:54.430> across<00:02:55.739> just<00:02:56.739> like

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
just glide straight across just like

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.979 
just glide straight across just like
that<00:02:57.190> pretty<00:02:57.670> simple<00:02:57.850> enough<00:02:58.239> and<00:02:58.480> then

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
that pretty simple enough and then

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.699 
that pretty simple enough and then
you're<00:02:59.140> going<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.350> sit<00:02:59.620> on<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.920> button<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:02.110> he

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
you're going to sit on the button and he

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.640 
you're going to sit on the button and he
will<00:03:02.980> lower<00:03:03.310> the<00:03:03.550> water<00:03:03.700> one<00:03:04.150> more<00:03:04.330> level<00:03:04.650> and

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
will lower the water one more level and

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.320 
will lower the water one more level and
then<00:03:05.800> we're<00:03:05.920> going<00:03:06.040> to<00:03:06.070> go<00:03:06.220> eat<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.910> process

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
then we're going to go eat the process

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.300 
then we're going to go eat the process
again<00:03:07.480> you'll<00:03:07.989> fly<00:03:08.170> back<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:08.709> Batmobile

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:29.860 
right there though just like that we've
got<00:04:25.940> them<00:04:27.160> now<00:04:28.160> turn<00:04:28.789> to<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.120> Batmobile<00:04:29.449> and

got them now turn to the Batmobile and

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.510 
got them now turn to the Batmobile and
this<00:04:30.020> time<00:04:30.229> on<00:04:30.500> the<00:04:30.590> second<00:04:30.949> level<00:04:31.070> you<00:04:31.340> are

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
this time on the second level you are

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.980 
this time on the second level you are
going<00:04:31.729> to<00:04:31.789> have<00:04:31.940> to<00:04:32.210> go<00:04:32.960> back

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:32.990 
going to have to go back

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.189 
going to have to go back
counterclockwise<00:04:34.479> to<00:04:35.479> open<00:04:35.840> up<00:04:35.960> the<00:04:36.080> space

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:36.199 
counterclockwise to open up the space

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:38.290 
counterclockwise to open up the space
for<00:04:36.650> the<00:04:36.770> third<00:04:37.010> one<00:04:37.310> you're<00:04:37.789> going<00:04:37.910> to<00:04:37.970> go<00:04:38.120> all

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
for the third one you're going to go all

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.600 
for the third one you're going to go all
the<00:04:38.479> way<00:04:38.510> until<00:04:39.110> the<00:04:39.260> block<00:04:39.560> reaches<00:04:40.070> right<00:04:40.370> by

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
the way until the block reaches right by

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.060 
the way until the block reaches right by
the<00:04:40.669> blades<00:04:41.410> and<00:04:42.410> then<00:04:42.530> when<00:04:42.620> you<00:04:42.710> hit<00:04:42.830> by<00:04:43.010> the

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
then you go over to number three then

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:59.140 
then you go over to number three then
you're<00:04:57.979> going<00:04:58.130> to<00:04:58.190> connect<00:04:58.430> to<00:04:58.490> number<00:04:58.760> three

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
you're going to connect to number three

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.360 
you're going to connect to number three
and<00:04:59.360> go<00:04:59.840> straight<00:05:00.110> down<00:05:00.200> once<00:05:00.830> again<00:05:01.099> if<00:05:01.280> you

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
and go straight down once again if you

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.490 
and go straight down once again if you
do<00:05:01.490> not<00:05:01.639> move<00:05:02.030> them<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.510> counterclockwise<00:05:03.020> to

do not move them to counterclockwise to

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.500 
do not move them to counterclockwise to
the<00:05:03.620> point<00:05:03.860> right<00:05:04.580> before<00:05:04.940> the<00:05:05.060> blades<00:05:05.300> you

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
the point right before the blades you

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:06.580 
the point right before the blades you
will<00:05:05.630> not<00:05:05.810> be<00:05:05.990> able<00:05:06.080> to<00:05:06.139> go<00:05:06.320> straight<00:05:06.530> down

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
will not be able to go straight down

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.379 
will not be able to go straight down
load<00:05:06.919> three<00:05:07.280> as<00:05:07.460> that<00:05:07.729> one<00:05:07.849> will<00:05:08.000> be<00:05:08.150> blocking

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
load three as that one will be blocking

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.480 
load three as that one will be blocking
you<00:05:09.160> then<00:05:10.160> once<00:05:10.340> you<00:05:10.400> get<00:05:10.520> down<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:10.729> three<00:05:12.490> you

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
you then once you get down to three you

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.219 
you then once you get down to three you
will<00:05:13.610> just<00:05:13.789> repeat<00:05:14.060> the<00:05:14.660> process<00:05:14.690> again

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:15.229 
will just repeat the process again
