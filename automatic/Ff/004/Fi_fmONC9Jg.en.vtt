for<00:00:47.280> steering<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.670> bike<00:00:47.899> so<00:00:48.899> what<00:00:49.020> I've<00:00:49.110> done

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
for steering the bike so what I've done

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.080 
for steering the bike so what I've done
this<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.469> my<00:00:49.710> wife's<00:00:49.980> Pacific<00:00:50.489> Coast<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.940> in

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
this is my wife's Pacific Coast it's in

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.619 
this is my wife's Pacific Coast it's in
a<00:00:51.140> I'm<00:00:52.140> kind<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.500> tearing<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.860> apart<00:00:53.539> so<00:00:54.539> you

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
a I'm kind of tearing it apart so you

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.540 
a I'm kind of tearing it apart so you
may<00:00:54.750> say<00:00:54.930> yourself<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:55.770> what<00:00:56.010> if<00:00:56.129> the<00:00:56.250> bearings

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
may say yourself so what if the bearings

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.619 
may say yourself so what if the bearings
are<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> little<00:00:56.940> bit<00:00:57.030> worn<00:00:57.300> what<00:00:57.510> does<00:00:57.600> that

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
are a little bit worn what does that

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.139 
are a little bit worn what does that
matter<00:00:57.930> well<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.739> actually<00:00:59.010> does<00:00:59.190> matter<00:00:59.430> you

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
matter well it actually does matter you

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.729 
matter well it actually does matter you
may<00:01:00.270> not<00:01:00.480> feel<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.840> when<00:01:01.440> you're<00:01:01.559> riding

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
may not feel it when you're riding

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.660 
may not feel it when you're riding
however<00:01:02.550> it<00:01:02.850> will<00:01:03.120> affect<00:01:03.539> itself<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.680> very

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
however it will affect itself in very

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.830 
however it will affect itself in very
rapidly<00:01:06.150> worn<00:01:06.479> tires<00:01:06.840> cupped<00:01:07.680> tires<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.840> more

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
rapidly worn tires cupped tires and more

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.570 
rapidly worn tires cupped tires and more
importantly<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.380> could<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.680> speed<00:01:11.070> wobbles

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
importantly you could get speed wobbles

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.570 
importantly you could get speed wobbles
or<00:01:11.790> other<00:01:12.600> dangerous<00:01:13.280> movements<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.369> bike

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
or other dangerous movements of bike

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.820 
or other dangerous movements of bike
that<00:01:14.610> you<00:01:14.970> aren't<00:01:15.150> expecting<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:16.530> how<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:16.740> we

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that you aren't expecting so how do we

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.070 
that you aren't expecting so how do we
check<00:01:17.009> for<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.400> well<00:01:17.909> first<00:01:18.150> thing<00:01:18.299> we<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.540> to

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
check for it well first thing we do to

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.810 
check for it well first thing we do to
put<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.320> bike<00:01:19.439> up<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> center<00:01:20.100> stand<00:01:20.310> and

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
put the bike up on the center stand and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.280 
put the bike up on the center stand and
as<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.540> see<00:01:21.600> I've<00:01:21.900> used<00:01:21.930> a<00:01:22.140> little

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
as you can see I've used a little

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.990 
as you can see I've used a little
trolley<00:01:22.590> Jack<00:01:22.860> just<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.189> gently<00:01:23.549> lift<00:01:23.850> the

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
trolley Jack just to gently lift the

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.999 
trolley Jack just to gently lift the
frame<00:01:24.270> of<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.509> bike<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:25.380> enough<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.860> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
frame of the bike just enough to get the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.530 
frame of the bike just enough to get the
wheel<00:01:26.189> maybe<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.700> half<00:01:26.880> inch<00:01:27.090> off<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.330> ground

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
wheel maybe a half inch off the ground

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.090 
wheel maybe a half inch off the ground
so<00:01:27.689> it'll<00:01:27.840> turn<00:01:28.049> from<00:01:28.259> side<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.470> side<00:01:28.590> without

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
so it'll turn from side to side without

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.620 
so it'll turn from side to side without
contacting<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> ground<00:01:29.820> we<00:01:30.210> want<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> be

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
contacting the ground we want it to be

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.080 
contacting the ground we want it to be
able<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.869> turn<00:01:30.990> freely<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:32.610> first<00:01:32.820> thing<00:01:33.000> you

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
able to turn freely the first thing you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.260 
able to turn freely the first thing you
want<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.299> do<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.570> check<00:01:33.750> for<00:01:33.810> lateral<00:01:34.200> play<00:01:35.270> if

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
want to do is check for lateral play if

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.330 
want to do is check for lateral play if
you<00:01:36.390> push<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.840> wheel<00:01:37.290> from<00:01:37.530> side<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.770> side<00:01:38.100> and

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
you push the wheel from side to side and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.700 
you push the wheel from side to side and
you<00:01:38.430> feel<00:01:38.640> some<00:01:38.909> kind<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.180> looseness<00:01:39.710> then

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
you feel some kind of looseness then

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.859 
you feel some kind of looseness then
either<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.610> bearings<00:01:41.939> are<00:01:42.060> loose<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.540> they're

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
either the bearings are loose or they're

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.690 
either the bearings are loose or they're
worn<00:01:43.170> in<00:01:43.439> this<00:01:43.770> case<00:01:44.009> you<00:01:44.250> can<00:01:44.369> see<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> little

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
worn in this case you can see a little

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.190 
worn in this case you can see a little
movements<00:01:45.180> because<00:01:45.450> I'm<00:01:45.570> moving<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.930> entire

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
movements because I'm moving the entire

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.649 
movements because I'm moving the entire
bike<00:01:46.470> but<00:01:46.770> they're<00:01:47.460> fairly<00:01:47.640> tight<00:01:48.030> the

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
bike but they're fairly tight the

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.780 
bike but they're fairly tight the
secondly<00:01:49.049> is<00:01:49.229> longitudinal<00:01:49.950> play<00:01:50.159> you<00:01:50.640> want

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
secondly is longitudinal play you want

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.149 
secondly is longitudinal play you want
to<00:01:50.850> push<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.119> front<00:01:51.869> wheel<00:01:52.170> forward<00:01:52.860> and<00:01:53.009> back

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
to push the front wheel forward and back

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:54.859 
to push the front wheel forward and back
this<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.549> normally<00:01:53.939> where<00:01:54.149> looseness<00:01:54.509> will

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
this is normally where looseness will

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.560 
this is normally where looseness will
show<00:01:55.049> up<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:56.040> if<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.280> are<00:01:56.430> pushing<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:57.000> forward

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
show up so if you are pushing it forward

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.090 
show up so if you are pushing it forward
and<00:01:57.810> back<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.259> feel<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> little<00:01:58.560> bit<00:01:58.979> of

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
and back and you feel a little bit of

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.190 
and back and you feel a little bit of
click<00:01:59.460> in<00:01:59.640> there<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.570> bearings<00:02:00.869> are<00:02:00.990> either

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
click in there the bearings are either

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.069 
click in there the bearings are either
worn<00:02:01.469> or<00:02:01.710> loose<00:02:02.210> there's<00:02:03.210> one<00:02:03.450> real<00:02:03.750> giveaway

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
worn or loose there's one real giveaway

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.539 
worn or loose there's one real giveaway
we<00:02:04.469> can<00:02:04.590> check<00:02:04.770> for<00:02:04.829> warrants<00:02:05.250> during

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
we can check for warrants during

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.010 
we can check for warrants during
bearings<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.299> we<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.570> do<00:02:06.689> that<00:02:06.810> standing<00:02:07.290> up

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
bearings and we can do that standing up

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.540 
bearings and we can do that standing up
the<00:02:10.020> steering<00:02:10.289> should<00:02:10.590> move<00:02:10.739> smoothly<00:02:11.160> from

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
the steering should move smoothly from

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.190 
the steering should move smoothly from
one<00:02:11.640> side<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.270> other

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
one side to the other

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.290 
one side to the other
that's<00:02:14.190> not<00:02:14.370> what's<00:02:14.550> happening<00:02:14.610> on<00:02:14.970> this<00:02:15.060> bike

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
that's not what's happening on this bike

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.730 
that's not what's happening on this bike
because<00:02:15.450> the<00:02:15.959> bearings<00:02:16.290> on<00:02:16.410> this<00:02:16.530> bike<00:02:16.709> are

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
because the bearings on this bike are

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.860 
because the bearings on this bike are
shot<00:02:17.099> as<00:02:17.370> you<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.300> see<00:02:18.480> if<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.840> push<00:02:19.110> it<00:02:20.870> it

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
shot as you can see if I push it it

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.449 
shot as you can see if I push it it
actually<00:02:22.050> has<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.349> detent<00:02:22.890> right

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
actually has a detent right

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.460 
actually has a detent right
when<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.330> wheel<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.720> straight<00:02:24.900> ahead<00:02:25.110> if

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
when this the wheel is straight ahead if

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.559 
when this the wheel is straight ahead if
I<00:02:25.560> push<00:02:25.770> it<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:25.980> way<00:02:26.190> you<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.459> see<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:27.540> that

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
I push it this way you can see and that

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.050 
I push it this way you can see and that
may<00:02:27.989> not<00:02:28.290> be<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:28.830> easy<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.250> see<00:02:29.400> but<00:02:29.550> I<00:02:29.610> tell<00:02:29.910> you

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
may not be so easy to see but I tell you

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.699 
may not be so easy to see but I tell you
you<00:02:30.300> can<00:02:30.450> feel<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.870> when<00:02:30.959> I<00:02:31.080> turn<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.350> it's

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
you can feel it when I turn it it's

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.490 
you can feel it when I turn it it's
definitely<00:02:32.550> right<00:02:32.700> there<00:02:32.970> as<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.020> can<00:02:34.140> see<00:02:34.290> it

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
definitely right there as you can see it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.860 
definitely right there as you can see it
it's<00:02:35.489> got<00:02:35.730> it<00:02:35.850> that<00:02:36.270> should<00:02:36.450> not<00:02:36.600> be<00:02:36.630> happening

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
it's got it that should not be happening

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.570 
it's got it that should not be happening
if<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.319> push<00:02:37.560> it<00:02:37.680> one<00:02:37.830> way<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.160> should<00:02:38.310> just<00:02:38.459> keep

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
if I push it one way it should just keep

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.070 
if I push it one way it should just keep
going<00:02:38.880> all<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.060> way<00:02:39.150> over<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.600> one<00:02:39.750> side<00:02:39.810> of

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
going all the way over to one side of

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.600 
going all the way over to one side of
the<00:02:40.140> other<00:02:40.170> should<00:02:40.530> not<00:02:40.680> be<00:02:40.800> stopping<00:02:41.130> and

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
the other should not be stopping and

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.130 
the other should not be stopping and
rocking<00:02:42.000> back<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.180> forth<00:02:42.540> in<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.780> center

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
rocking back and forth in the center

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.440 
rocking back and forth in the center
there<00:02:43.319> that's<00:02:44.069> because<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.519> bearings<00:02:44.970> are

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
there that's because the bearings are

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.360 
there that's because the bearings are
worn<00:02:45.780> from<00:02:46.230> many<00:02:46.440> many<00:02:46.680> miles<00:02:46.890> like<00:02:47.160> going

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
worn from many many miles like going

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.550 
worn from many many miles like going
straight<00:02:47.670> ahead<00:02:47.930> this<00:02:48.930> is<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.140> particularly

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
straight ahead this is a particularly

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.830 
straight ahead this is a particularly
heavy<00:02:50.040> bike<00:02:50.310> so<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.030> bearings<00:02:51.330> will<00:02:51.540> wear

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
heavy bike so the bearings will wear

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.220 
heavy bike so the bearings will wear
after<00:02:52.590> a<00:02:52.620> time<00:02:52.940> so<00:02:53.940> the<00:02:54.720> bearings<00:02:55.049> in<00:02:55.140> this

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
after a time so the bearings in this

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.509 
after a time so the bearings in this
bike<00:02:55.410> need<00:02:55.590> to<00:02:55.680> be<00:02:55.799> changed<00:02:56.280> well<00:02:56.400> that

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
bike need to be changed well that

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.970 
bike need to be changed well that
steering<00:02:56.819> bearings<00:02:57.239> I<00:02:57.480> have<00:02:58.049> another<00:02:58.350> DIY

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
steering bearings I have another DIY

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.280 
steering bearings I have another DIY

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
article on goldlink Doc's calm that

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.530 
article on goldlink Doc's calm that
shows<00:03:01.440> exactly<00:03:01.650> how<00:03:02.160> to<00:03:02.220> go<00:03:02.580> about<00:03:02.850> changing

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
shows exactly how to go about changing

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.420 
shows exactly how to go about changing
the<00:03:03.840> steering<00:03:04.140> bearings<00:03:04.470> on<00:03:04.620> the<00:03:04.950> golden<00:03:05.280> and

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
the steering bearings on the golden and

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.340 
the steering bearings on the golden and
in<00:03:05.519> fact<00:03:05.700> this<00:03:05.880> is<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.090> 1500<00:03:06.690> gold<00:03:07.049> wing<00:03:07.200> that

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
in fact this is the 1500 gold wing that

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.559 
in fact this is the 1500 gold wing that
I<00:03:07.380> used<00:03:07.680> for<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.190> DIY<00:03:08.670> so<00:03:09.239> you'll<00:03:09.420> see

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
I used for that DIY so you'll see

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.300 
I used for that DIY so you'll see
pictures<00:03:09.720> of<00:03:09.930> that<00:03:10.140> bike<00:03:10.350> all<00:03:10.560> taken<00:03:10.920> apart<00:03:11.160> in
