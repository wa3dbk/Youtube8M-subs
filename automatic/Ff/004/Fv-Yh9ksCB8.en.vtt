00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
stuff it's like Lucas something I think

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.720

so<00:00:37.790> Jase<00:00:38.790> thing<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.540> to<00:00:39.750> get<00:00:39.899> to<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.730> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
so Jase thing is to get to is the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.100 
so Jase thing is to get to is the

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
cylinder head what I'm using is a little
