00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.060 
I love it and then I have this one
that's<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.360> little<00:02:34.810> bit<00:02:34.930> similar<00:02:35.230> but<00:02:35.710> it's

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
that's a little bit similar but it's

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.910 
that's a little bit similar but it's
smaller<00:02:36.400> and<00:02:36.790> I'll<00:02:36.940> show<00:02:37.150> you<00:02:37.260> how<00:02:38.260> like<00:02:38.590> how

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
smaller and I'll show you how like how

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.420 
smaller and I'll show you how like how
much<00:02:39.100> smaller<00:02:39.460> it's<00:02:40.180> um<00:02:40.590> it<00:02:41.590> does<00:02:41.830> that<00:02:42.070> color

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
much smaller it's um it does that color

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.810 
much smaller it's um it does that color
but<00:02:42.760> it<00:02:42.880> doesn't<00:02:43.210> really<00:02:43.300> show<00:02:44.310> it's<00:02:45.310> kind<00:02:45.670> of

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
but it doesn't really show it's kind of

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.810 
but it doesn't really show it's kind of
blue<00:02:46.150> a<00:02:46.510> little<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:48.400> do<00:02:49.180> it<00:02:49.360> some<00:02:49.570> other<00:02:49.720> way

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
blue a little it's do it some other way

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.050 
blue a little it's do it some other way
hole<00:02:51.820> trying<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.330> peek<00:02:52.540> over<00:02:52.800> okay<00:02:53.800> so<00:02:54.310> the

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
hole trying to peek over okay so the

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.850 
hole trying to peek over okay so the
difference<00:02:55.420> between<00:02:55.660> those<00:02:56.080> two<00:02:56.410> are<00:02:57.630> do<00:02:58.860> you

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
difference between those two are do you

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.860 
difference between those two are do you
see<00:03:00.070> I'll<00:03:00.190> make<00:03:00.820> one's<00:03:01.060> a<00:03:01.240> little<00:03:01.330> bigger<00:03:01.540> I

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
see I'll make one's a little bigger I

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.030 
see I'll make one's a little bigger I
guess<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:04.209> don't<00:03:04.660> notice<00:03:05.170> or<00:03:05.560> just<00:03:05.830> don't

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
guess you don't notice or just don't

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.660 
guess you don't notice or just don't
give<00:03:06.190> a

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
give a

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.690 
give a
and<00:03:07.080> there's<00:03:08.080> one<00:03:08.350> I<00:03:08.380> got<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:08.890> I<00:03:08.920> really<00:03:09.490> hate

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
and there's one I got that I really hate

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.730 
and there's one I got that I really hate
and<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.209> thought<00:03:10.540> this<00:03:10.750> would<00:03:10.959> be<00:03:11.020> cool<00:03:11.440> because

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
and I thought this would be cool because

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:13.890 
and I thought this would be cool because
I<00:03:12.280> wanted<00:03:12.670> to<00:03:12.820> get<00:03:12.940> something<00:03:13.180> different<00:03:13.480> I

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
I wanted to get something different I

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.110 
I wanted to get something different I
wanted<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.410> get<00:03:14.860> its<00:03:16.110> goes<00:03:17.110> in<00:03:17.530> like<00:03:18.459> this<00:03:18.760> and

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
wanted to get its goes in like this and

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.949 
wanted to get its goes in like this and
then<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:22.480> part<00:03:23.489> sticks<00:03:24.489> out<00:03:24.880> and<00:03:25.239> it<00:03:25.630> kind<00:03:25.900> of

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
then this part sticks out and it kind of

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.320 
then this part sticks out and it kind of
flops<00:03:26.200> over<00:03:26.650> like<00:03:26.860> this<00:03:27.100> and<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.820> doesn't<00:03:28.209> look

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:28.330 
flops over like this and it doesn't look

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.870 
flops over like this and it doesn't look
good<00:03:28.510> at<00:03:28.660> all<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:29.739> I'm<00:03:30.010> probably<00:03:30.280> going<00:03:30.670> to<00:03:30.730> get

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
good at all so I'm probably going to get

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.720 
good at all so I'm probably going to get
rid<00:03:31.030> of<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.330> the<00:03:32.200> next<00:03:32.530> one<00:03:32.769> is<00:03:33.190> kind<00:03:33.519> of<00:03:33.580> my

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
rid of that the next one is kind of my

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.000 
rid of that the next one is kind of my
favorite<00:03:34.269> but<00:03:34.510> I<00:03:34.540> don't<00:03:34.780> have<00:03:35.019> a<00:03:35.530> lot<00:03:35.980> of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
favorite but I don't have a lot of

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.540
