00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.820
 hi everyone and it's jojo 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.670
 I hope you are well then 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.599
 today an informational video where 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.969
 I gave some information 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.510
 important things that have something to do with my 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.590
 chain and his three things to tell you 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.430
 first thing that is the most 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.769
 important 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.380
 I participate in a very special competition 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.130
 and that is super important to the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.500
 Youtube channel 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.570
 I participate in the 01net 01net contest 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.969
 I think you know the purpose is 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.320
 very simple is to participate in 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.880
 propose a video 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.680
 so I decided to take the video 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.899
 unpacking the live gear 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.149
 I will put the link in the 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.660
 description so that you can go 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.070
 to see her 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.989
 and to win we are judged by 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.629
 different points humor 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.340
 the subject is also the editing so 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.320
 I found that my live gear video 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.270
 corresponded to the different points 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.609
 to participate in the contest 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.829
 so I put this video for 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.320
 participate then why am I talking to you 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.600
 of that ben simply because that 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.430
 I would like to win why we have 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.110
 still the first thing to win is 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.520
 a high tech product of 300 euros me 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.119
 personally that's not what 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.760
 interests me 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.049
 if I win for example this contest - the 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.689
 gift I gave it an orange subscriber 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.920
 organizes a contest but the second 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.930
 thing that we win and that's the 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.450
 opportunity to go to the premises of 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.210
 01net talked with the officials from there 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.579
 down also the journalists and especially 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.840
 participated in a live video and 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.670
 personally I think it's a 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.439
 good way for me to make myself known 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.750
 to publicize the youtube channel 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.640
 for it to evolve even more I you 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.250
 remember that I am amateur I do 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.960
 but my videos next to my studies and 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.240
 jean he professionalize me in and 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.759
 so being able to participate in 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.290
 this contest is maybe winning it 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.420
 can be something very positive 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.610
 for my youtube channel so to win 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.100
 this contest so we are judged by the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.180
 video but also by the number of views 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.219
 If I understood correctly 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.130
 so I still enjoy my 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.630
 youtube channel and this video for 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.329
 you are asking for your help so that you 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:07.619
 can just watch this video 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.239
 is anyway it's not for a purpose 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.009
 personal this is really the purpose of the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.810
 chain that they evolved and that 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.099
 improve me the goal it's really not 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.200
 see the case of 300 euros that I do not care 

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.130
 I tell you again a second time 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.940
 me it's really the possibility 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.670
 to go to 01net and share my channel 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.099
 youtube talked about my project is from 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.810
 to have the opinion especially of 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.220
 professionals the result is positive 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.260
 or negative 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.970
 well I'll keep you posted and 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.250
 precisely down this sentence she is fine 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.380
 because that's the second 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.540
 thing that I wanted to tell you precisely 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:41.519
 all that is information know that 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.049
 I am also on other networks 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.840
 social other than youtube 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.860
 I am on facebook twitter or google + 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.620

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.299

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.360
 follow on social networks where I 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.209
 I'm just because it's 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.780

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.079
 share more things on instagram ben 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.450
 you have the opportunity to have 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:33.209
 pictures on future videos that are going 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.609
 go out and google + on the other hand that I 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:38.549
 the only used for cases a 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.049
 video that comes out the video to share them 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:41.730
 third important thing and that will be 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.989
 the last I moved on time 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:45.690
 before i lived in strasbourg 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.750
 wandering I live in annecy-le-vieux for 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.560
 studies there I am in master hyper 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:52.690
 media and communications 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.480
 annecy and coupon I live in annecy 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:57.550
 for studies and internet connection 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.989
 is really we can say it shit he 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.430
 promised me fiber optics and me 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:02.470
 That's far from being the case 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.209
 and suddenly it's a shame because 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:07.239
 that this year I had many projects 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:09.400
 fun to do with videos in 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.599
 direct to do and suddenly it falls to 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.470
 water because to make videos in 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.140
 direct you have to have a 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.760
 ok internet connection so good 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.769
 this year there will be some small 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.079
 live videos but very rarely 

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:22.450
 when I return would come back to 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.910
 strasbourg during the holidays for 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:27.970
 see the family again or concrete 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.380
 sometimes at my girlfriend's house because 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.090
 that she has a flow that remains correct 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.430
 to make videos and good video 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.260
 informational is over I hope 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.030
 that you liked it we find ourselves in 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.030
 an upcoming video 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:39.030
 Hi
