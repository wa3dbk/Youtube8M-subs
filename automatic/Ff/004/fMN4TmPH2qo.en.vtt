00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210

is significant I think she's gonna move
all<00:01:17.450> in<00:01:17.630> because<00:01:17.780> she<00:01:18.710> knows<00:01:18.860> she<00:01:19.009> realized

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
all in because she knows she realized

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.340 
all in because she knows she realized
he's<00:01:19.430> a<00:01:19.460> cop<00:01:19.850> piece<00:01:21.880> okay<00:01:22.880> oh<00:01:23.290> she's<00:01:24.290> just

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350

he's a cop piece okay oh she's just
calling<00:01:24.860> okay<00:01:25.160> I<00:01:25.340> thought<00:01:25.820> maybe<00:01:26.060> she<00:01:26.330> was

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
calling okay I thought maybe she was

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.999 
calling okay I thought maybe she was
thinking<00:01:26.630> actually<00:01:26.899> if<00:01:27.140> I<00:01:27.200> move<00:01:27.410> all<00:01:27.619> in<00:01:27.800> here

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:28.009 
thinking actually if I move all in here

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:29.410 
thinking actually if I move all in here
he<00:01:28.160> probably<00:01:28.369> thinks<00:01:28.610> he's<00:01:28.820> prop<00:01:29.030> committed

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
he probably thinks he's prop committed

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.969 
he probably thinks he's prop committed
so<00:01:29.570> he'll<00:01:29.810> have<00:01:29.990> to<00:01:30.140> call<00:01:30.290> anyway

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979
