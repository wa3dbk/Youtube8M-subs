00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
you can certainly drink it and this was

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.370 
you can certainly drink it and this was
only<00:02:19.140> about<00:02:19.319> a<00:02:19.650> half<00:02:20.010> hour<00:02:20.250> process<00:02:20.610> at<00:02:21.030> most

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
only about a half hour process at most

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.000 
only about a half hour process at most
so<00:02:22.380> sure<00:02:23.340> if<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:23.549> want<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.819> cake<00:02:24.060> and<00:02:24.269> wait<00:02:24.450> a

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
so sure if you want a cake and wait a

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.740 
so sure if you want a cake and wait a
week<00:02:26.010> for<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.370> to<00:02:26.459> carbonate<00:02:26.940> go<00:02:27.150> for<00:02:27.450> it<00:02:27.569> I

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
week for it to carbonate go for it I

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.449 
week for it to carbonate go for it I
think<00:02:28.500> that's<00:02:28.620> totally<00:02:28.890> defeats<00:02:29.220> the<00:02:29.310> purpose

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
think that's totally defeats the purpose

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:30.680 
think that's totally defeats the purpose
of<00:02:29.700> cake<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.120> you<00:02:30.180> might<00:02:30.329> as<00:02:30.420> well<00:02:30.540> just

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
of cake and you might as well just

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.440 
of cake and you might as well just
bottle<00:02:31.109> so<00:02:31.500> anyway<00:02:32.430> I'm<00:02:32.639> the<00:02:32.760> roll<00:02:32.970> around<00:02:33.180> for

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
bottle so anyway I'm the roll around for

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.410 
bottle so anyway I'm the roll around for
ten<00:02:33.600> minutes<00:02:33.780> and<00:02:33.930> we'll<00:02:34.079> go<00:02:34.200> from<00:02:34.230> there
