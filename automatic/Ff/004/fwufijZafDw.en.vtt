00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.200
Even if you pursue it, you can’t get close

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.620
Even if you keep running away, you can’t get further

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.120
Swaying at the gap of infinity

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.700
surrender yourself to the flow of the river

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:52.280
Good night, all you sorrowful souls

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.700
Please go and now rest in peace

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.440
Love and grief and pain and everything else

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.940
If you end up crossing over, everything will already be an illusion

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.600
Goodbye cruel world, welcome to the new world you desired

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.320
Dreams and hate and pain and everything else

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.800
If you end up disappearing, everything will already be an illusion

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:30.860
Being lured by the scent of the swaying flowers on the far shore they continue dancing

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.700
Even if you get closer, you can’t reach it

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.080
Even if you keep distancing yourself, you can’t escape

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.640
The time for the end is already here

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.100
surrender yourself to the flow of time

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:15.820
Good night, all you foolish souls

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:23.240
A quiet death awaits you here

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.920
Good and evil and black and white and everything else

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.400
if you end up mixing them up, everything will already be an illusion

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.120
Goodbye to your future and welcome to the beautiful world you desired

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.840
Light and dark and strength and even weakness too

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.340
if you disappear everything will already be an illusion

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:54.140
Being guided by the location of the flowers on they see on other side they continue dancing

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.640
Love and grief and pain and everything else

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.100
If you end up crossing over, everything will already be an illusion

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:18.820
Goodbye cruel world, welcome to the new world you desired

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.540
Dreams and hate and pain and everything else

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.060
If you end up disappearing, everything will already be an illusion

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:36.280
Being lured by the scent of the swaying flowers on the far shore they continue dancing
