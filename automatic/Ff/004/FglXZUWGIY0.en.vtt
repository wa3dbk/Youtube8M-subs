00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:04.430
 well now we have the opportunity 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.640
 ask a couple of questions the murado department 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:11.269
 Satybaldiyeva whose debut was 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.160
 well we all saw one rosskazhi in 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.830
 what age did you start practicing 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.270
 boxing to boxing on really only 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.289
 three years ago I was doing it 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.289
 kickboxing 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:22.340
 already 13 years in general sports and here years 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.680
 kickboxing 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.990
 and just recently 2010 switched to boxing 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.420
 and amateur 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.460
 two and a half years have boxed and decided 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.260
 go to professionals and to 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.659
 amateur ring which is the biggest 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.909
 achievements you had if not considered 

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:39.409
 the silver medal of Europe is just 

00:00:37.909 --> 00:00:42.139
 world championship participant we were not lucky 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:45.649
 a bit more often the world championship 

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:48.409
 what have I come to tell you only 18 years old 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.879
 as we know in Ukraine since the age of 18 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.670
 can be a professional boxer 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.619
 it was your wish who made you think 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.719
 so at such an early age become 

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:58.399
 professional boxer and if in new 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.499
 I would probably want to see 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.760
 action there I would have dreamed about it all 

00:01:00.499 --> 00:01:02.600
 life just step on 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.329
 professional ring 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.030
 Since childhood I have been watching fights Mike Tyson and 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:08.450
 as if constantly attracted it all I passed 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.009
 earlier 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.299
 honestly eighteen 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.659
 turned out I said coach I want 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.579
 a professional, he helped me a little 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.979
 it turned out how much preparation for fought 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:20.719
 duel and what's the difference between 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.600
 professional boxing and amateur 

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:25.399
 today you feel the difference 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.649
 The preparation lasted for a month and a half on 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.429
 in fact generally the best diseases or 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.859
 unsuccessfully, then all would come well, victory 

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:36.350
 Republican and the difference in amateur 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:39.289
 it is already noticeable that the round will increase by 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:41.719
 1 round and no more team there stop 

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.399
 openly there are many allowed to put 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:45.649
 boxing to put restore where he 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.439
 open what melee much time 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.899
 is given in the amateur constantly breaking 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.770
 do not give a blow even a man and is about 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:57.200
 number I think this is the difference tell here 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.719
 Already talked about what your idol Mike 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.100
 tyson and we saw today in general 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:04.460
 some elements are even very 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:07.310
 really looks like how are you 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.800
 and take this manner and on what else 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:12.110
 your opinion need to work I started 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.300
 boxing I already said 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.370
 looked scared and i have since we 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.290
 Wanted already learning was repeating his movement 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.180
 then with time I look, well, I'm not 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.489
 we repeated already I became automatic 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.130
 nothing trying and get it from 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:28.520
 study there well I think that from me 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:30.230
 left speed and force of impact think 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.900
 as seen today there will not rise 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.930
 after strikes became one strike force and 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.610
 speed to add a Well 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.269
 congratulations on your victory and good luck in 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.269
 further duels
