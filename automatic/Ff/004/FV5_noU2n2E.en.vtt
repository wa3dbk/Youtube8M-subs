00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
that are closer to the house we have

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.080 
that are closer to the house we have
some<00:02:37.260> junipers<00:02:37.800> some<00:02:38.069> low<00:02:38.250> growing<00:02:38.489> junipers

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
some junipers some low growing junipers

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.360 
some junipers some low growing junipers
and<00:02:39.120> deer<00:02:39.720> typically<00:02:40.200> don't<00:02:40.410> like<00:02:40.530> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
and deer typically don't like the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.979 
and deer typically don't like the

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
junipers we're going to spray them

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.140 
junipers we're going to spray them
anyway<00:02:43.500> because<00:02:44.069> we<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.580> see<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.879> deer

keep<00:03:46.440> all<00:03:46.769> of<00:03:47.010> these<00:03:47.190> trees<00:03:47.940> where<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.389> the

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
keep all of these trees where the the

keep all of these trees where the the
deer<00:03:49.019> are<00:03:49.139> probably<00:03:49.410> rubbing<00:03:49.769> their<00:03:49.920> antlers

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280

on<00:03:50.489> there<00:03:51.500> clear<00:03:52.500> of<00:03:52.669> all<00:03:53.669> that<00:03:53.880> activity

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
on there clear of all that activity

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.449 
on there clear of all that activity
okay<00:03:54.690> so<00:03:54.750> we're<00:03:55.049> even<00:03:55.200> gonna<00:03:55.470> spray<00:03:55.859> boxwood

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
okay so we're even gonna spray boxwood

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.420 
okay so we're even gonna spray boxwood
that's<00:03:56.819> another<00:03:57.269> it's<00:03:58.169> another<00:03:58.349> plant<00:03:59.280> that

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
that's another it's another plant that

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.670 
that's another it's another plant that
deer<00:04:00.239> typically<00:04:00.750> don't<00:04:00.900> like<00:04:01.049> but<00:04:01.380> like<00:04:01.500> I

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
deer typically don't like but like I

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.890 
deer typically don't like but like I
said<00:04:01.739> we're<00:04:02.400> trying<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.760> do<00:04:02.880> a<00:04:02.910> perimeter<00:04:03.569> here

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
said we're trying to do a perimeter here

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.229 
said we're trying to do a perimeter here
and<00:04:04.410> we're<00:04:04.620> changing<00:04:05.130> the<00:04:05.579> path<00:04:05.849> that<00:04:06.090> the

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
and we're changing the path that the

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.479 
and we're changing the path that the
deer<00:04:06.480> are<00:04:06.690> moving<00:04:06.750> on<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.859> so<00:04:08.040> it's<00:04:08.250> gonna

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
deer are moving on and so it's gonna

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.000 
deer are moving on and so it's gonna
take<00:04:08.790> them<00:04:08.970> away<00:04:09.269> from<00:04:09.660> wherever<00:04:10.349> it<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:10.829> that

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
take them away from wherever it is that

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.430
