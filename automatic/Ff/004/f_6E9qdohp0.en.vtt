A head of celery is made up of finely ribbed U-shaped stalks. To remove the fibers (strings) from the celery quickly, simply break each stalk near the end (rounded side) and pull gently. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You can also peel the stalks with a paring knife. Note that the strings are found only on the rounded side. This method gives more professional results. 
The celery heart doesn’t have any strings. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Cut each stalk into shorter lengths. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Cut each length into sticks, removing each rounded side, for an equal-sized cut. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The diagonal cut is perfect for sautéed vegetables. Choose fairly big pieces if you’re serving the celery as a side vegetable, for instance, Asian-style. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Or smaller pieces to use in mixed vegetables, soup, salad, etc. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:32.000
To mince, cut a stalk lengthwise into sticks. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Line up the sticks and chop crosswise. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.200
The branched part can be used to flavor a stock.
