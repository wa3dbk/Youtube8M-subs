00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 very good unleashed if it went to the water and 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.799
 welcome to the information of the world 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 of pokemon good guys yesterday out 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.849
 information or information has come out 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.410
 so it has been so much so much theory 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.849
 I have to make a video 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.980
 obviously only for the trailer 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.540
 that has come out today and this new pokemon 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.830
 that we do not know who is in motion 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.960
 simply that's why it's playing the video 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.400
 to talk to you and explain to you who is 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.199
 well I know that the comments also 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.000
 There is debate that is what I like the most 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.710
 the truth read your theories of the other 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.720
 you told me that my theory that a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.250
 the best come together all are exploited or 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.630
 they meet in the plant is with the plan 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.160
 the tentacles of the 'floor of the one who 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.840
 they come together and evolve try with him 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.059
 that maybe it was a pretty theory 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.129
 good evolution move on from and it seems to be 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.270
 that this theory in the end is going to be real in 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.860
 let's say they spoke good first that 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.329
 teach the trail so go see it and 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:49.280
 now we speak come over there 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:51.350
 mega 51 also prosecuted my jail 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.290
 nothing but arona wants to win at 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.090
 no one 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.270
 carved that dances 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.200
 it will be passion 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.200
 5 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.670
 why he took sexual ets and mega tradition 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.299
 five acts 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.299
 good 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.070
 the flip- flop trailer that is the train 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.530
 delighted the drawing is very well done 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.380
 the action is tremendous and above all there 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.180
 two two things in that trailer that I 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.159
 they seem quite shocking one of them 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.380
 is when all the green pokémon are 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.610
 let's all say the little green pokemon 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.710
 because he does not know the name and I want 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.939
 be the name and I shit in the tail you see 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.549
 that a che spin is the spin of the 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.840
 protagonist and steals one of them and is 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:38.580
 like he's in a lab and at 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.930
 steal it all from the lab one of 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.670
 they go after the check-in saying 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.200
 because he's stealing, I want that 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.390
 pokemon because it is very important or you 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.940
 they give a pretty huge importance 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.590
 because because these look like this pokemon 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:51.299
 Greens are under investigation 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.130
 because they are under investigation 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.450
 nothing is known yet nothing is clear 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.340
 and I really want to know 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.530
 surely it stops next month or 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.420
 the day 21 August 22 and 23 because they are 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.560
 the pokemon world championships and 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.179
 there is this yunis and more fruit that is the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.500
 president of game freak and surely 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.119
 Say something I'm pretty sure 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.670
 go I garcía del brings as a 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.950
 explosion because there is a damn thing 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.660
 damn explosion and that now after 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.250
 that explosion is not known practically 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.000
 nothing but I know there are theories 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.770
 evidently 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.830
 the theory of after the explosion 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.450
 it comes out fígar de is the most concrete and I 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.310
 I think it 's the most everyone 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.320
 think about her and it's what I said in her 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.670
 moment I said maybe they all come together 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.660
 and evolves in zig burns 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.490
 obviously he did not know he was going to 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.660
 explode but maybe they explode 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.310
 and evolve and thank you very much 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.140
 see what is this pokemon I repeat is a 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.060
 pokémon that is quite scared so 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.300
 that looks like it's a little pretty 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.220
 pretty kawaii let's say very shy very 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.140
 miedoso I'm not sure why and 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.880
 I repeat is not a little the only thing so 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.459
 there are several of them I do not know how much is 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.020
 he also does not want to say it but it seems to be 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:51.390
 that there are like five or six 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.800
 maybe there's more I say I repeat it's not a 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:54.239
 unique species so the best there is 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.090
 many scattered all over the world but 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.890
 there is nothing concrete in theory so 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.980
 it does not taste good has also confirmed 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.260
 an event for europe of various breed 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.120
 color remember shiny that will come between the 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.470
 August 24 and September 30 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.940
 you have to go like a store that 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.070
 he still does not know what is his because it will be 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.050
 a good game gamestop and Nestor is not 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.390
 a game you probably have to go to a 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.040
 game download the code and then on your 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.209
 house exchange it or something like that but the style 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.650
 basically as always is to do the 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.750
 events in spain I do not know really 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.420
 Latin America how will it be present 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.100
 that memory event also arrives 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.470
 sainz and so everyone who wants 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.270
 that shiny memory will be able to have it 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.650
 without any problem so no 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.090
 this kind of event is always done 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.470
 this time I shit in the crib and finally 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.960
 a lot of information has also come out 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.340
 about the pokémon mysterious world has 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.100
 come out that you are going to be able to visit five 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.860
 continents that are going to be let's say the 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.450
 with which you will be able to travel to those 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:47.160
 five continents in plan there is a lot 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.140
 water and contains them are distributed 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:51.300
 but you will be able to travel by water 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.250
 flight in theory you will not be able to do it 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.140
 but it's going to give basically the same for 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.130
 be more will be very fast with the phrase 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.680
 I do not think there's any kind of 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.030
 no kind of problem in that aspect and 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.709
 the mega ones were also bought 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.209
 evolutions a lot ago and it has 

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:04.200
 confirmed now that you will be able to carry 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.150
 the mega evolutions and you will be able to 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.290
 fight with the mega evolution is to say 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.700
 with come cher izar there are a couple of 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.980
 images that come out to land there you go to 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.630
 can even break the stage thing 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.920
 that surprises me because it 's quick that 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:15.270
 is going to be able to do in a world 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.530
 mysterious so it's going to be pretty 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:17.640

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.220
