00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.820
 the cell one 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:27.160
 series is constructed as follows the outer 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.640
 layer contains a bacterial cell only 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.380
 him 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.960
 this layer comes with the animal 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:35.760
 Do not put cells under it 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:39.720
 As usual, the cell membrane is the chromosome 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:43.420
 lies without cell nucleus and to the plasma 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:47.280
 Verein owns the bacterial cell small 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:51.010
 addition commissions name pale down 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.370
 for movement, the bacterium has one 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.370
 hostage 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:04.739

 streptococcus staphylococcus chopsticks 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.990
 Bacteria and play 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.470
 Now we come to the genetic combination 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.540
 theories transferring a plasmid with 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.770
 Helping a plasma bridge connect 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.770
 two bacterial cells 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.759
 a bacterial cell 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.280
 the one plasma bridge forms very much 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.299
 varied her DNA and transmits it 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.299
 to the receiver counter 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.380
 parts of the exceeded 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.720
 dna become the plasmid and into the 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.229
 Chromosomal DNA of the recipient cell 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.229
 built-in 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.920
 the chromosomal DNA is transcribed 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.039
 and transported this leads to education 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.280
 new proteins changed new proteins 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.230
 characteristics of the bacterial cell of the 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.120
 transmitted single radiant as on the 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.410
 Lingering strand will be in both 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.950
 cells back to a double strand
