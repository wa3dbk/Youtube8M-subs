reasons because I've done a lot of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.299 
reasons because I've done a lot of
practice<00:00:47.910> trips<00:00:48.800> obviously<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.890> run-up<00:00:50.160> and

practice trips obviously the run-up and

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.150 
practice trips obviously the run-up and
I<00:00:51.000> noticed<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:51.780> with<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.320> rain<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:52.949> the

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.819 
I noticed that with the rain and the
weather<00:00:53.340> in<00:00:53.520> England<00:00:54.379> cycling<00:00:55.379> with<00:00:55.590> glasses

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
weather in England cycling with glasses

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.650 
weather in England cycling with glasses
on<00:00:56.070> when<00:00:56.309> its<00:00:56.430> rainy<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.760> actually<00:00:57.239> really

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
on when its rainy is actually really

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.479 
on when its rainy is actually really
dangerous<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.410> honest<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.980> found

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
dangerous to be honest with the I found

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.540 
dangerous to be honest with the I found
that<00:00:59.609> my<00:00:59.820> glasses<00:01:00.270> would<00:01:00.539> steam<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:01.550> water

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
that my glasses would steam up water

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.039 
that my glasses would steam up water
would<00:01:02.760> collect<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.449> lenses<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:03.960> was

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
constantly wiping and then it would

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.350 
constantly wiping and then it would
leave<00:01:05.309> sort<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.610> quite<00:01:05.729> blurred<00:01:06.060> sort<00:01:06.299> of

obviously dipping into you know the
solution<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.790> dirty<00:01:33.299> fingers<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.780> whatever

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
solution and dirty fingers and whatever

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.050 
solution and dirty fingers and whatever
else<00:01:34.049> like<00:01:34.350> you're<00:01:34.500> asking<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.009> an<00:01:36.000> eye

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
else like you're asking for an eye

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.819 
else like you're asking for an eye
infection<00:01:36.180> basically<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.470> difference

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
infection basically and the difference

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.620 
infection basically and the difference
is<00:01:37.920> just<00:01:38.189> ridiculous<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:39.270> know<00:01:39.360> not<00:01:39.479> having

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
is just ridiculous you know not having

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.420 
is just ridiculous you know not having
to<00:01:39.810> worry<00:01:39.840> about<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.290> glasses<00:01:40.470> to<00:01:40.979> start<00:01:41.250> with

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
to worry about the glasses to start with

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.490 
to worry about the glasses to start with
but<00:01:41.640> but<00:01:42.150> also<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.479> appreciation<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:43.200> even

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
but but also the appreciation of even

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.800 
but but also the appreciation of even
sort<00:01:43.860> of<00:01:43.920> things<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.520> just<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> views<00:01:45.570> that

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
sort of things like just the views that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.060 
sort of things like just the views that
you<00:01:45.869> come<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.229> him<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.409> if<00:01:46.470> once<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.890> get<00:01:47.040> to

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
you come to him and if once you get to

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.310 
you come to him and if once you get to
the<00:01:47.220> top<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.520> hill<00:01:47.549> or<00:01:47.759> a<00:01:47.909> mountain<00:01:48.200> you<00:01:49.200> want

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
the top of a hill or a mountain you want

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.240 
the top of a hill or a mountain you want
to<00:01:49.380> be<00:01:49.439> able<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.619> see<00:01:49.770> all<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.920> way<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
to be able to see all the way to the

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.590 
to be able to see all the way to the
risin<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.700> see<00:01:50.820> what's<00:01:51.000> around<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
risin and see what's around you and to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.249 
risin and see what's around you and to
appreciate<00:01:52.009> what<00:01:53.009> you're<00:01:53.159> seeing<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:54.390> so

appreciate what you're seeing and so

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.420 
appreciate what you're seeing and so
it's<00:01:55.380> making<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.680> huge<00:01:55.920> difference<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.340> that

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
it's making a huge difference to that

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.130 
it's making a huge difference to that
and<00:01:57.149> obviously<00:01:57.240> other<00:01:57.509> thing<00:01:57.630> is<00:01:57.689> road<00:01:57.869> road

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
and obviously other thing is road road

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.889 
and obviously other thing is road road

worried at all so yeah it's made an
absolutely<00:02:18.040> huge<00:02:18.459> difference<00:02:18.879> we're<00:02:19.510> going

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
absolutely huge difference we're going

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.030 
absolutely huge difference we're going
to<00:02:19.660> go<00:02:19.750> through<00:02:19.989> a<00:02:20.170> total<00:02:20.620> of<00:02:20.680> twenty-five

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.400 
to go through a total of twenty-five
countries<00:02:21.330> although<00:02:22.330> our<00:02:22.569> route<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:22.959> quite

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
countries although our route is quite

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.500 
countries although our route is quite
flexible<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:24.519> mean<00:02:24.970> we've<00:02:25.090> got<00:02:25.120> to<00:02:25.269> be<00:02:25.330> quite

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
flexible I mean we've got to be quite

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.930 
flexible I mean we've got to be quite
well<00:02:26.110> slightly<00:02:26.980> flexible<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.489> the<00:02:27.580> Middle

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
well slightly flexible in the Middle

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:29.759 
well slightly flexible in the Middle
East<00:02:28.060> region<00:02:28.569> and<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:29.170> know<00:02:29.260> getting<00:02:29.440> visas

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
East region and you know getting visas

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.770 
East region and you know getting visas
for<00:02:29.950> Iran<00:02:30.370> and<00:02:30.670> some<00:02:30.879> of<00:02:30.970> the<00:02:31.209> Central<00:02:31.540> Asian

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.289 
for Iran and some of the Central Asian
countries<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.440> China<00:02:33.280> can<00:02:33.760> be<00:02:33.849> quite<00:02:34.269> tricky

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
countries and China can be quite tricky

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.720 
countries and China can be quite tricky
and<00:02:35.230> sometimes<00:02:36.010> they<00:02:36.129> just<00:02:36.160> put<00:02:36.400> an<00:02:36.459> outright

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
and sometimes they just put an outright

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.910 
and sometimes they just put an outright
ban<00:02:36.760> on<00:02:37.180> until<00:02:37.690> letting<00:02:37.959> you<00:02:38.290> know<00:02:38.410> Westerners

into<00:02:39.190> into<00:02:39.549> certain<00:02:39.790> countries<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:40.299> we've<00:02:40.840> got

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
into into certain countries so we've got

into into certain countries so we've got
to<00:02:41.049> be<00:02:41.110> flexible<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.709> know<00:02:41.799> we<00:02:41.920> want<00:02:42.010> to<00:02:42.160> avoid

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
to be flexible you know we want to avoid

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.270 
to be flexible you know we want to avoid
getting<00:02:42.430> on<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.730> plane<00:02:42.760> at<00:02:43.090> all<00:02:43.209> costs<00:02:44.160> but<00:02:45.160> if

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
getting on a plane at all costs but if

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.250 
getting on a plane at all costs but if
we<00:02:45.400> have<00:02:45.549> to<00:02:45.700> sort<00:02:45.849> of<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.630> know<00:02:46.690> reroute

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
we have to sort of you know reroute

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.960 
we have to sort of you know reroute
through<00:02:47.440> Georgia<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.220> maybe<00:02:48.370> sort<00:02:48.610> of<00:02:48.640> into

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
through Georgia and maybe sort of into

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.890 
through Georgia and maybe sort of into
Kazakhstan<00:02:49.620> they<00:02:50.620> then<00:02:50.829> say<00:02:51.010> bit<00:02:51.220> but<00:02:52.090> but<00:02:52.360> on

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
Kazakhstan they then say bit but but on

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.229 
Kazakhstan they then say bit but but on
paper<00:02:53.260> at<00:02:53.470> the<00:02:53.530> moment<00:02:53.890> are<00:02:54.069> it's<00:02:54.880> 25

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
paper at the moment are it's 25

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.750 
paper at the moment are it's 25
countries<00:02:55.390> well<00:02:56.190> but<00:02:57.190> yeah<00:02:57.310> so<00:02:57.519> it's<00:02:57.670> about

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
countries well but yeah so it's about

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.270 
countries well but yeah so it's about
18,000<00:02:58.480> miles<00:02:58.599> Ling<00:02:58.870> well<00:02:59.470> I<00:02:59.500> think<00:02:59.620> laser<00:03:00.160> eye

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
18,000 miles Ling well I think laser eye

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.569 
18,000 miles Ling well I think laser eye
surgeries<00:03:00.790> made<00:03:01.030> the<00:03:01.930> world<00:03:02.290> of<00:03:02.440> difference

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
surgeries made the world of difference

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.430 
surgeries made the world of difference
for<00:03:03.579> this<00:03:03.700> trip<00:03:03.970> I<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.209> generally<00:03:05.049> think<00:03:05.079> it

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
for this trip I I generally think it

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.490 
for this trip I I generally think it
went<00:03:06.280> wouldn't<00:03:06.579> be<00:03:06.640> possible<00:03:06.760> if<00:03:07.690> I<00:03:08.019> didn't

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
went wouldn't be possible if I didn't

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.259 
went wouldn't be possible if I didn't
have<00:03:08.590> this<00:03:08.650> treatment<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.310> think<00:03:09.610> it's<00:03:09.760> it's

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
have this treatment I think it's it's

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:11.699 
have this treatment I think it's it's
going<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.599> be<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.780> start<00:03:11.019> of<00:03:11.170> you<00:03:11.560> know

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
going to be the start of you know

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.100 
going to be the start of you know
probably<00:03:12.160> a<00:03:12.489> few<00:03:13.120> more<00:03:13.209> trips<00:03:13.510> after<00:03:13.690> that<00:03:13.959> I'd

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
probably a few more trips after that I'd

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.620 
probably a few more trips after that I'd
like<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.410> think
