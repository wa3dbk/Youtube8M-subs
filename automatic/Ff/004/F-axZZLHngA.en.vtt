00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
and then I'm going to show you the

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.219 
and then I'm going to show you the
improvement<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:40.860> get<00:01:41.159> using<00:01:41.640> an<00:01:41.909> SSD<00:01:42.390> so

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
improvement you get using an SSD so

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.039 
improvement you get using an SSD so
let's<00:01:43.380> get<00:01:43.500> on<00:01:43.560> with<00:01:43.590> it

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.950 

okay<00:01:50.049> so<00:01:50.110> we're<00:01:50.320> gonna<00:01:50.409> do<00:01:50.590> a<00:01:50.680> test<00:01:51.250> using<00:01:51.610> the

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
okay so we're gonna do a test using the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.050 
okay so we're gonna do a test using the
Blackmagic<00:01:52.979> application<00:01:53.979> I<00:01:54.100> downloaded<00:01:54.670> from

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
Blackmagic application I downloaded from

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.670 
Blackmagic application I downloaded from
the<00:01:55.180> App<00:01:55.210> Store<00:01:55.600> which<00:01:55.899> will<00:01:56.049> test<00:01:56.289> the<00:01:56.409> speed

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
the App Store which will test the speed

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.289 
the App Store which will test the speed
while<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.039> read<00:01:57.280> and<00:01:57.310> the<00:01:57.549> write<00:01:57.640> speed<00:01:58.149> of

00:01:58.289 --> 00:01:58.299 
while the read and the write speed of

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.149 
while the read and the write speed of
the<00:01:58.600> current<00:01:58.899> disc<00:01:59.170> so<00:01:59.409> as<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.619> can<00:01:59.710> see<00:01:59.770> here

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
the current disc so as you can see here

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.800 
the current disc so as you can see here
we<00:02:00.460> did<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.700> write<00:02:00.880> speed<00:02:01.179> first<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.689> we're

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
we did the write speed first and we're

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.039 
we did the write speed first and we're
getting<00:02:02.200> around<00:02:02.579> 86<00:02:03.579> megabytes<00:02:04.569> a<00:02:04.659> second

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
getting around 86 megabytes a second

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.230 
getting around 86 megabytes a second
which<00:02:05.170> isn't<00:02:05.380> that<00:02:05.590> great<00:02:05.829> to<00:02:06.039> be<00:02:06.130> honest<00:02:06.429> it's

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
which isn't that great to be honest it's

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.440 
which isn't that great to be honest it's
wrong<00:02:07.390> to<00:02:07.539> read<00:02:07.899> now<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.349> again<00:02:08.920> it's<00:02:09.489> at<00:02:09.729> 86

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
wrong to read now and again it's at 86

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.930 
wrong to read now and again it's at 86
it's<00:02:10.660> our<00:02:10.869> of<00:02:11.019> 88<00:02:11.560> so<00:02:11.950> you<00:02:12.400> can<00:02:12.519> see<00:02:12.700> that<00:02:12.819> the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
it's our of 88 so you can see that the

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.210 
it's our of 88 so you can see that the
speeds<00:02:13.269> aren't<00:02:13.690> that<00:02:13.870> fast<00:02:14.140> and<00:02:14.500> we<00:02:15.069> don't

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
speeds aren't that fast and we don't

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.910 
speeds aren't that fast and we don't
have<00:02:15.400> that<00:02:15.550> many<00:02:15.700> green<00:02:16.239> ticks<00:02:16.599> just<00:02:16.989> below<00:02:17.380> so

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
have that many green ticks just below so

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.170 
have that many green ticks just below so
what<00:02:18.040> I'm<00:02:18.099> gonna<00:02:18.220> do<00:02:18.459> I'm<00:02:18.700> going<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.000> actually

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
what I'm gonna do I'm going to actually

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.780 
what I'm gonna do I'm going to actually
take<00:02:19.569> out<00:02:19.810> the<00:02:19.930> disk<00:02:20.190> inside<00:02:21.190> my<00:02:21.340> Mac<00:02:21.549> Mini

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
take out the disk inside my Mac Mini

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.320 
take out the disk inside my Mac Mini
install<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.720> SSD<00:02:23.459> reinstall<00:02:24.459> Lion<00:02:24.819> and<00:02:25.060> then

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
install the SSD reinstall Lion and then

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.000 
install the SSD reinstall Lion and then
we're<00:02:25.420> going<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.569> do<00:02:25.720> another<00:02:26.140> test<00:02:26.530> and<00:02:26.739> see

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
we're going to do another test and see

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.670 
we're going to do another test and see
what<00:02:27.190> results<00:02:27.640> we<00:02:27.700> get<00:02:28.380> okay<00:02:29.380> so<00:02:29.440> I've

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
what results we get okay so I've

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.289 
what results we get okay so I've
actually<00:02:29.799> swapped<00:02:30.190> over<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.519> disk<00:02:30.730> now<00:02:30.940> and<00:02:31.150> as

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
actually swapped over to disk now and as

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.500 
actually swapped over to disk now and as
you<00:02:31.450> can<00:02:31.599> see<00:02:31.780> here<00:02:32.260> I've<00:02:32.560> got<00:02:32.769> 128<00:02:33.640> gigabyte<00:02:34.330> a

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
you can see here I've got 128 gigabyte a

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.839 
you can see here I've got 128 gigabyte a
solid-state<00:02:35.230> drive<00:02:35.860> now<00:02:36.250> obviously<00:02:36.579> this<00:02:36.700> is

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:36.849 
solid-state drive now obviously this is

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.960 
solid-state drive now obviously this is
where<00:02:37.000> OS<00:02:37.209> 10<00:02:37.690> Lion<00:02:38.470> is<00:02:38.650> installed<00:02:39.190> now<00:02:39.790> what

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
where OS 10 Lion is installed now what

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.789 
where OS 10 Lion is installed now what
I'm<00:02:40.060> going<00:02:40.180> to<00:02:40.209> do<00:02:40.360> is<00:02:40.630> close<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.260> down<00:02:41.500> and

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:41.799 
I'm going to do is close this down and

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:44.699 
I'm going to do is close this down and
I'm<00:02:41.950> gonna<00:02:42.069> bring<00:02:42.340> in<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.940> black<00:02:43.840> magic<00:02:44.230> test

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
I'm gonna bring in the black magic test

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.680 
I'm gonna bring in the black magic test
and<00:02:45.069> we're<00:02:45.250> gonna<00:02:45.340> do<00:02:45.489> another<00:02:45.640> one<00:02:45.880> so<00:02:46.329> if<00:02:46.540> we

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
and we're gonna do another one so if we

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.240 
and we're gonna do another one so if we
do<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:47.019> now<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.380> it'll<00:02:47.470> do<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.709> write<00:02:47.920> first

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
do that now so it'll do the write first

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.520 
do that now so it'll do the write first
as<00:02:48.549> it<00:02:48.700> did<00:02:48.819> last<00:02:48.849> time<00:02:49.180> now<00:02:50.079> previously<00:02:50.290> we've

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
as it did last time now previously we've

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.740 
as it did last time now previously we've
got<00:02:50.620> about<00:02:50.769> 86<00:02:51.459> on<00:02:51.700> this<00:02:52.090> we're<00:02:52.329> hitting

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
got about 86 on this we're hitting

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.590 
got about 86 on this we're hitting
around<00:02:53.250> 139<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.579> think<00:02:55.090> the<00:02:55.150> highest<00:02:55.299> one<00:02:55.480> there

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
around 139 I think the highest one there

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.599 
around 139 I think the highest one there
may<00:02:55.720> be<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.870> hundred<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.200> forty-one<00:02:56.489> wait<00:02:57.489> for

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:57.609 
may be a hundred and forty-one wait for

00:02:57.609 --> 00:02:59.910 
may be a hundred and forty-one wait for
that<00:02:57.700> to<00:02:57.790> finish<00:02:57.819> and<00:02:58.390> the<00:02:59.019> write<00:02:59.260> speed<00:02:59.650> is

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
that to finish and the write speed is

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.069 
that to finish and the write speed is
nearly<00:03:00.579> doubled<00:03:01.150> I<00:03:01.329> think<00:03:01.510> it's<00:03:01.630> more<00:03:01.900> than

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
nearly doubled I think it's more than

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.930 
nearly doubled I think it's more than
doubled<00:03:02.440> every<00:03:02.590> what<00:03:02.799> 200<00:03:03.400> before<00:03:03.609> that<00:03:03.850> we

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
doubled every what 200 before that we

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.729 
doubled every what 200 before that we
didn't<00:03:04.090> even<00:03:04.180> get<00:03:04.299> to<00:03:04.450> a<00:03:04.480> hundred<00:03:04.959> so<00:03:05.139> you<00:03:05.650> can

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
didn't even get to a hundred so you can

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.699 
didn't even get to a hundred so you can
see<00:03:05.859> the<00:03:05.980> difference<00:03:06.340> by<00:03:07.000> installing<00:03:07.569> the<00:03:07.900> SSD

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
see the difference by installing the SSD

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.860 
see the difference by installing the SSD
into<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.579> drive<00:03:09.819> where<00:03:10.090> has<00:03:10.239> no<00:03:10.450> moving<00:03:10.720> parts

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
into the drive where has no moving parts

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.530 
into the drive where has no moving parts
and<00:03:11.319> the<00:03:11.680> performance<00:03:12.250> is<00:03:12.400> just<00:03:12.670> far<00:03:12.970> far<00:03:13.000> far

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
and the performance is just far far far

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.690 
and the performance is just far far far
superior<00:03:14.190> so<00:03:15.190> what<00:03:15.280> I'm<00:03:15.340> going<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.489> show<00:03:15.639> you

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
superior so what I'm going to show you

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.940 
superior so what I'm going to show you
now<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.389> actual<00:03:16.870> boot<00:03:17.139> up<00:03:17.350> time<00:03:17.620> which<00:03:17.799> is

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
now is the actual boot up time which is

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.460 
now is the actual boot up time which is
insane<00:03:18.340> from<00:03:18.970> the<00:03:19.299> standard<00:03:19.840> disk<00:03:20.049> to<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.639> SSD

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
insane from the standard disk to the SSD

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.020 
insane from the standard disk to the SSD
okay<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:23.530> we're<00:03:23.859> off<00:03:24.100> so<00:03:24.430> that<00:03:24.639> both<00:03:24.790> been

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
okay so we're off so that both been

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.300 
okay so we're off so that both been
turned<00:03:25.239> on<00:03:25.329> exactly<00:03:25.870> the<00:03:25.989> same<00:03:26.170> time<00:03:26.410> and

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
turned on exactly the same time and

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.650 
turned on exactly the same time and
we'll<00:03:27.549> see<00:03:27.730> which<00:03:27.940> one<00:03:28.120> wins<00:03:28.269> I<00:03:28.420> think<00:03:28.450> it's

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
we'll see which one wins I think it's

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.180 
we'll see which one wins I think it's
going<00:03:28.780> to<00:03:28.840> be<00:03:28.930> fairly<00:03:29.109> obvious<00:03:29.290> which<00:03:29.769> one<00:03:30.010> is

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
going to be fairly obvious which one is

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:31.440 
going to be fairly obvious which one is
going<00:03:30.489> to<00:03:30.639> win

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
going to win

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:33.180 
going to win
so<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.900> SSD<00:03:32.350> at<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.500> top<00:03:32.680> has<00:03:32.829> already<00:03:33.040> got

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
so the SSD at the top has already got

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:35.160 
so the SSD at the top has already got
the<00:03:33.280> Apple<00:03:33.670> logo<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.569> standard<00:03:34.930> drive

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
the Apple logo and the standard drive

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.360 
the Apple logo and the standard drive
has<00:03:35.470> just<00:03:35.620> got<00:03:35.709> to<00:03:35.799> buying<00:03:35.950> the<00:03:36.160> screen

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
has just got to buying the screen

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.340 
has just got to buying the screen
haven't<00:03:36.670> even<00:03:36.730> got<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.269> Apple<00:03:37.569> logo<00:03:37.690> just<00:03:38.139> yet

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
haven't even got the Apple logo just yet

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.140 
haven't even got the Apple logo just yet
and<00:03:38.620> so<00:03:39.130> we'll<00:03:39.250> see<00:03:39.400> what<00:03:39.549> happens<00:03:39.880> in<00:03:40.060> a

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
and so we'll see what happens in a

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.780 
and so we'll see what happens in a
second<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:43.380> there<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.530> go<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:44.889> SSD<00:03:45.519> has

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
second and there you go the SSD has

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.699 
second and there you go the SSD has
already<00:03:46.239> loaded<00:03:46.690> and<00:03:46.870> we're<00:03:46.989> on<00:03:47.109> the<00:03:47.230> desktop

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
already loaded and we're on the desktop

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.589 
already loaded and we're on the desktop
on<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:47.980> standard<00:03:48.670> drive<00:03:48.910> at<00:03:49.090> the<00:03:49.150> bottom<00:03:49.450> we

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
on the standard drive at the bottom we

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.240 
on the standard drive at the bottom we
haven't<00:03:49.810> even<00:03:49.900> had<00:03:50.019> the<00:03:50.079> Apple<00:03:50.560> logo<00:03:50.709> come<00:03:51.099> up

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
haven't even had the Apple logo come up

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:54.810 
haven't even had the Apple logo come up
so<00:03:51.489> when<00:03:52.180> I<00:03:52.209> installed<00:03:52.720> a<00:03:52.870> lion<00:03:53.290> onto<00:03:54.009> the<00:03:54.160> SSD

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
so when I installed a lion onto the SSD

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.360 
so when I installed a lion onto the SSD
it<00:03:55.299> actually<00:03:55.660> took<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.229> of<00:03:56.410> about<00:03:56.919> five

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
it actually took and of about five

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.770 
it actually took and of about five
minutes<00:03:57.639> and<00:03:57.910> just<00:03:58.090> under<00:03:58.299> five<00:03:58.479> minute

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
minutes and just under five minute

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.540 
minutes and just under five minute
to<00:03:58.870> actually<00:03:59.170> install<00:03:59.770> it<00:03:59.800> when<00:04:00.459> I've

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
to actually install it when I've

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.850 
to actually install it when I've
installed<00:04:00.940> lion<00:04:01.600> on<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.840> standard<00:04:02.620> hard<00:04:02.800> drive

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
installed lion on a standard hard drive

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.790 
installed lion on a standard hard drive
before<00:04:03.160> it<00:04:03.490> takes<00:04:03.730> roughly<00:04:03.970> about<00:04:04.180> 15<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:05.380> 20

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
before it takes roughly about 15 to 20

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.680 
before it takes roughly about 15 to 20
minutes<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:06.760> you<00:04:06.819> can<00:04:06.910> you<00:04:06.970> see<00:04:07.150> the<00:04:07.270> speed

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
minutes so you can you see the speed

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.140 
minutes so you can you see the speed
improvement<00:04:08.440> by<00:04:08.920> getting<00:04:09.280> an<00:04:09.400> SSD<00:04:09.700> so<00:04:10.030> we've

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 
improvement by getting an SSD so we've

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.880 
improvement by getting an SSD so we've
just<00:04:10.330> got<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.600> Apple<00:04:10.959> logo<00:04:11.110> come<00:04:11.440> up<00:04:11.560> on<00:04:11.740> the

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:11.890 
just got the Apple logo come up on the

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.970 
just got the Apple logo come up on the
standard<00:04:12.280> drive<00:04:13.020> it's<00:04:14.020> now<00:04:14.170> thinking<00:04:14.740> about

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
standard drive it's now thinking about

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.190 
standard drive it's now thinking about
it<00:04:15.250> so<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:15.520> can<00:04:15.640> just<00:04:15.670> see<00:04:16.000> that<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.419> SSD<00:04:16.959> has

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
it so you can just see that the SSD has

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.560 
it so you can just see that the SSD has
absolutely<00:04:17.919> annihilated<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:19.150> standard

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
absolutely annihilated the standard

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:25.070 
absolutely annihilated the standard
drive<00:04:19.810> that<00:04:20.019> comes<00:04:20.200> with<00:04:20.410> the<00:04:20.859> Mac<00:04:21.070> Mini<00:04:21.579> and

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.510 

was<00:04:26.080> still<00:04:26.320> waiting<00:04:26.530> list<00:04:26.980> that<00:04:27.040> hasn't<00:04:27.400> come

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
was still waiting list that hasn't come

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:30.629 
was still waiting list that hasn't come
up<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:29.560> I<00:04:29.590> think<00:04:29.680> it's<00:04:29.860> fairly<00:04:30.040> it's<00:04:30.370> fairly

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
up so I think it's fairly it's fairly

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.150 
up so I think it's fairly it's fairly
safe<00:04:30.880> to<00:04:30.940> say<00:04:31.270> that<00:04:31.600> buying<00:04:32.169> an<00:04:32.320> SSD<00:04:32.590> really

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
safe to say that buying an SSD really

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.330 
safe to say that buying an SSD really
does<00:04:33.310> improve<00:04:33.700> your<00:04:34.540> PC<00:04:35.260> your<00:04:35.620> Mac<00:04:35.890> whichever

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
does improve your PC your Mac whichever

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.250 
does improve your PC your Mac whichever
your<00:04:36.520> going<00:04:36.640> to<00:04:36.760> decide<00:04:37.000> to<00:04:37.060> put<00:04:37.330> it<00:04:37.419> into<00:04:37.750> to

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:38.260 
your going to decide to put it into to

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.040 
your going to decide to put it into to
get<00:04:38.410> the<00:04:38.500> best<00:04:38.740> performance<00:04:38.980> out<00:04:39.490> of<00:04:39.610> it<00:04:40.050> and

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
get the best performance out of it and

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.350 
get the best performance out of it and
it<00:04:41.650> still<00:04:41.890> hasn't<00:04:42.070> booted<00:04:42.580> will<00:04:43.030> take<00:04:43.210> we're

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
it still hasn't booted will take we're

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.600 
it still hasn't booted will take we're
nearly<00:04:43.570> there<00:04:43.919> next<00:04:44.919> couple<00:04:45.130> of<00:04:45.190> seconds<00:04:45.520> and

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:45.610 
nearly there next couple of seconds and

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:47.909 
nearly there next couple of seconds and
it<00:04:45.700> should<00:04:45.940> come<00:04:46.180> up<00:04:46.390> and<00:04:46.840> finally<00:04:47.740> it's

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
it should come up and finally it's

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:49.710 
it should come up and finally it's
actually<00:04:48.310> loaded<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:48.940> the<00:04:48.970> desktop<00:04:49.450> so<00:04:49.570> you

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
actually loaded to the desktop so you

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.780 
actually loaded to the desktop so you
can<00:04:49.870> see<00:04:50.110> what<00:04:51.010> a<00:04:51.040> difference<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:51.580> makes

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:51.790 
can see what a difference it makes

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.630 
can see what a difference it makes
having<00:04:52.000> an<00:04:52.240> SSD<00:04:52.979> so<00:04:53.979> if<00:04:54.070> you<00:04:54.160> want<00:04:54.310> to<00:04:54.370> see<00:04:54.520> the
