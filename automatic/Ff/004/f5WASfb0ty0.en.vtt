 I'm looking forward to a story 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:42.270
 Of course, so what history would like 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:47.370

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:51.020

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.020
 Elephant and a giraffe 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.570
 clearly that works 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.930
 We just think a story 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:00.210
 so in africa lives a little 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.309
 crocodile plays best 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:11.700
 hide with his three friends the 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:13.560
 three friends are playing friends 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.290

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.860
 You want to search for me and we are looking for 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:26.070
 first closes the eyes and the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.490
 other animals hide the monkey 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.070
 The apple first comes to a tree 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.210
 he hides because there it is 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.600
 maybe the crocodile 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.759
 no the elephant the elephant the monkey 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.549
 has found the elephant and continues 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:47.189
 the search of the monkey crawls in 

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.189
 a bush and what then discovered 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.479
 bike yes the monkey discovers so one 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.710
 old rusty bicycle 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.649
 Cycling is much more fun than it is 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:04.299
 play hide and seek but then drives 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:07.659
 he back and forth and back and forth 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:10.239
 other animals the giraffe and the 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.860
 crocodile wait and wait in theirs 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.720
 hide the poor 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.180
 then they have no desire to wait 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:22.330
 Now you are looking for the larvae on the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.880
 The giraffe gets the bike from the top 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.780
 The monkey simply has a better view 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.860
 guilty conscience 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.440
 Oh, I forgot you because 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:36.100
 The driving has done so much fun 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:39.970
 my monkey tired murmurs and what we do 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:45.310
 Now the giraffe asks you to go 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:47.560
 conclusion yes and because the monkey everything 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:53.260
 he wants to make amends 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:57.410
 bike a a pedal boat everyone is allowed to fan 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:59.300
 and everybody is happy about that 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.280
 story of the monkey of a bicycle 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:15.520
 finds and almost his friends 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:15.520
