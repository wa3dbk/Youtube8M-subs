00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.930
 hello youtube partners welcome to 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.940
 my dinosaur video number 16 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.039
 today it's up to help raptor 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.049
 yuta raptor is an animal genus 

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.330
 represented by a single species of 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.060
 dinosaurs sauroischians theropod 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:22.669
 dromaeosaurs that lived early 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.849
 of the Cretaceous during the Barri 

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:29.329
 about 124 million ago 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:32.150
 of years is until now the dinosaur of 

00:00:29.329 --> 00:00:35.150
 Largest known raptor type 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.250
 his name means thief of yuta 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.610
 Although the first specimens of 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.590
 this reactor date from 1975 the most 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.670
 striking discovery was given to 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:49.190
 meet in 1991 this is a great 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.660
 claw found by Carlos lemon and in 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.300
 a quarry of gastÃ³n cuadril yuta 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.850
 and the most curious thing about yuta raptor is his 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.010
 size was little higher than a being 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.950
 human and average almost 6 meters long 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.290
 weighed half a ton these dimensions 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.300
 are the ones attributed to velociraptor 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.869
 the directors of the Jurassic park 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.090
 during production the most curious thing is 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.850
 that at that time I kidnapped you 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.050
 had been discovered yet this was 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.600
 did so that the velociraptors 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.050
 they could be terrible enemies of the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.050
 humans 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.119
 shortly after the discovery of yuta 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.340
 raptors were found several 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.710
 partial specimens in different 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.570
 locations in the country had 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.850
 sharp and curved fangs in the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.210
 jaws each the size of a 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.450
 human thumb 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.840
 measured twice as much as damon and cus and weighed 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.180
 almost ten times more he owned in the second 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.970
 a claw toe that exceeded 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.369
 20 centimeters in length is one of the 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.970
 longer wars discovered up 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.530
 now in raptor dinosaurs and other 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.270
 raptor is also famous for having 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:08.539
 appeared on the television series 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.429
 the bbc walking among dinosaurs what 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:12.020
 that I will never understand is because the 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.420
 narrator was referring to this dinosaur 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.860
 as velociraptor in the translation to 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.410
 Spanish 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.240
 It will be a mistranslation I guess 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.150
 I would call it velociraptor because it is a 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.920
 pretty more famous dinosaur I hope 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.750
 that you liked my YouTube video 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.370
 raptors if it's like that a thumbs up by 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.680
 please if you have not liked with the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.300
 quiet conscience a thumb down and 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.010
 before finishing the video I'm going to 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.690
 leave them with some images of the making 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.780
 off the series walking between 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.580
 dinosaurs in which a raptor yuta 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.580
 Tell about your experience in the series 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.550
 which contains appeared harder than 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.580
 to work 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.440
 and the animators of course with the 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.690
 animators chase after the 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.050
 chases dinosaurs service though what 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.050
 we knew
