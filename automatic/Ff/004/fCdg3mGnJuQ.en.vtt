to back to beat him first like trying to

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.809 
to back to beat him first like trying to
make<00:01:47.299> them<00:01:47.450> really<00:01:47.600> stock<00:01:48.520> but<00:01:49.520> these<00:01:49.670> are

00:01:49.809 --> 00:01:49.819 
make them really stock but these are

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:51.609 
make them really stock but these are
pretty<00:01:49.909> soft<00:01:50.179> as<00:01:50.390> it<00:01:50.420> is<00:01:50.630> so<00:01:50.810> it's<00:01:51.259> not<00:01:51.380> like

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
pretty soft as it is so it's not like

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.440 
pretty soft as it is so it's not like
play-doh<00:01:51.890> soft<00:01:52.310> but<00:01:52.610> it's<00:01:52.850> tough<00:01:53.090> I<00:01:53.329> don't

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
play-doh soft but it's tough I don't

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.249 
play-doh soft but it's tough I don't
know<00:01:54.399> and<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:55.579> you<00:01:55.640> roll<00:01:55.939> it<00:01:56.119> be<00:01:56.899> sure<00:01:57.049> to<00:01:57.170> be

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
know and so you roll it be sure to be

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.840 
know and so you roll it be sure to be
working<00:01:57.560> on<00:01:57.679> the<00:01:57.770> glass<00:01:57.979> surface<00:01:58.189> it's<00:01:58.549> so

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
working on the glass surface it's so

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:04.730 
working on the glass surface it's so
much<00:01:59.000> easier

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.990 

the<00:02:05.740> little<00:02:05.980> snake<00:02:08.460> I'm<00:02:09.460> gonna<00:02:09.610> try<00:02:09.729> to<00:02:09.790> speed

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
the little snake I'm gonna try to speed

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.490 
the little snake I'm gonna try to speed
this<00:02:10.119> up<00:02:10.270> who's<00:02:10.720> gonna<00:02:10.810> want<00:02:11.050> it<00:02:11.110> to<00:02:11.170> be<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.290> long

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
this up who's gonna want it to be a long

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:27.030 
this up who's gonna want it to be a long
tutorial

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.660 

make<00:02:27.640> sure<00:02:27.790> they're<00:02:27.970> like<00:02:28.150> equal<00:02:28.989> I<00:02:29.489> guess<00:02:30.489> the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
make sure they're like equal I guess the

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.789 
make sure they're like equal I guess the
width<00:02:31.110> like<00:02:32.110> you<00:02:32.230> don't<00:02:32.349> want<00:02:32.470> one<00:02:32.620> to<00:02:32.739> be

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:32.799 
width like you don't want one to be

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.429 
width like you don't want one to be
fatter<00:02:33.310> than<00:02:33.579> the<00:02:33.730> other<00:02:33.849> so<00:02:34.239> I'll<00:02:35.230> try<00:02:35.409> to

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:35.439 
fatter than the other so I'll try to

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.059 
fatter than the other so I'll try to
equal<00:02:36.159> them<00:02:36.280> out

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.369 

and<00:02:39.579> then<00:02:39.760> you<00:02:39.849> add<00:02:40.000> them<00:02:40.299> together<00:02:40.510> and<00:02:41.049> they

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
and then you add them together and they

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:51.130 
and then you add them together and they
slice<00:02:41.620> off<00:02:41.799> this<00:02:41.920> way

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.980 

to<00:02:51.680> do<00:02:52.300> Rowland

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:02.030 

just<00:02:56.620> like<00:02:56.770> it<00:02:56.890> stick<00:02:57.130> together

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.540 

and<00:03:02.280> hopefully<00:03:02.640> doesn't<00:03:02.970> break

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
and hopefully doesn't break

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.150 
and hopefully doesn't break
twisting

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:34.900 

very<00:03:08.790> carefully<00:03:09.330> not<00:03:09.660> not<00:03:10.230> too<00:03:10.410> hard

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:36.460 

I<00:03:34.940> like<00:03:35.510> working<00:03:35.690> with<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.990> ends<00:03:36.260> more

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
I like working with the ends more

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.070 
I like working with the ends more
because<00:03:36.770> it's<00:03:36.980> easier<00:03:37.570> in<00:03:38.570> like<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:38.900> middle

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
because it's easier in like the middle

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.810 
because it's easier in like the middle
you<00:03:39.380> get<00:03:39.500> one<00:03:39.740> side<00:03:39.950> that's<00:03:40.130> all<00:03:40.280> though<00:03:40.520> and

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
you get one side that's all though and

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:48.460 
you get one side that's all though and
once<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.090> that's<00:03:41.300> all<00:03:41.450> taken<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:48.380> you

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
once a that's all taken and you

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.780 
once a that's all taken and you
determine<00:03:48.770> how<00:03:49.100> long<00:03:49.310> you<00:03:49.580> want<00:03:49.760> your

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
determine how long you want your

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.210 
determine how long you want your
stretcher<00:03:50.540> to<00:03:50.750> the<00:03:50.780> I<00:03:50.900> guess<00:03:51.230> you'd<00:03:51.980> call<00:03:52.010> it

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
stretcher to the I guess you'd call it

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.160 
stretcher to the I guess you'd call it
that's<00:03:52.490> not<00:03:52.640> really<00:03:52.880> a<00:03:52.910> cage<00:03:53.210> you're<00:03:54.050> just

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
that's not really a cage you're just

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.610 
that's not really a cage you're just
stretching<00:03:54.380> your<00:03:54.620> ear<00:03:56.200> cut<00:03:57.200> off<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.410> sites

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
stretching your ear cut off the sites

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.100 
stretching your ear cut off the sites
that<00:03:57.770> can<00:03:57.950> be<00:03:58.070> equal<00:03:58.480> not<00:03:59.480> all<00:04:00.070> lumpy<00:04:01.900> okay<00:04:02.930> and

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
that can be equal not all lumpy okay and

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:06.790 
that can be equal not all lumpy okay and
then<00:04:03.380> I<00:04:03.680> want<00:04:04.250> mine<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:04.700> be<00:04:05.170> they<00:04:06.170> bust<00:04:06.500> on<00:04:06.680> my

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
then I want mine to be they bust on my

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.520 
then I want mine to be they bust on my
ruler<00:04:07.010> I<00:04:07.540> think<00:04:08.540> it's<00:04:08.630> like<00:04:08.720> two<00:04:08.930> inches<00:04:11.530> yeah

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
ruler I think it's like two inches yeah

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.720 
ruler I think it's like two inches yeah
like<00:04:12.740> two<00:04:12.890> inches<00:04:13.160> will<00:04:13.280> be<00:04:13.310> cool<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:15.640> get<00:04:16.640> it

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
like two inches will be cool so get it

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.789 
like two inches will be cool so get it
off<00:04:16.850> there

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
off there

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:25.600 
off there
and<00:04:19.340> then<00:04:19.519> measure<00:04:19.970> another<00:04:20.299> side<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:25.460> can

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
and then measure another side you can

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.920 
and then measure another side you can
use<00:04:25.759> this<00:04:25.970> for<00:04:26.300> I<00:04:26.330> don't<00:04:26.419> know<00:04:26.569> whatever<00:04:26.840> you

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
use this for I don't know whatever you

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:28.420 
use this for I don't know whatever you
want<00:04:27.080> maybe<00:04:27.470> you<00:04:27.590> can<00:04:27.710> make<00:04:27.800> more<00:04:27.979> gauges<00:04:28.340> out

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
want maybe you can make more gauges out

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.710 
want maybe you can make more gauges out
of<00:04:28.580> them<00:04:28.789> and<00:04:28.909> sell<00:04:29.150> them<00:04:29.360> I<00:04:29.419> don't<00:04:29.629> know<00:04:31.720> you

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
of them and sell them I don't know you

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.450 
of them and sell them I don't know you
just<00:04:32.960> roll<00:04:33.319> it<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:36.020> it<00:04:36.319> can<00:04:36.470> be<00:04:36.650> thin<00:04:36.979> on<00:04:37.250> the

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
just roll it so it can be thin on the

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.920 
just roll it so it can be thin on the
one<00:04:37.789> side<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:38.240> you<00:04:38.330> can<00:04:38.419> enter<00:04:38.599> your<00:04:38.690> ear

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
one side so you can enter your ear

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:46.700 
one side so you can enter your ear
equally<00:04:39.500> easily<00:04:40.310> my<00:04:40.699> bed

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.440 

and

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
and

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.150 
and
when<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:49.020> have<00:04:49.140> it<00:04:49.260> like<00:04:49.380> that<00:04:49.410> you<00:04:49.770> just<00:04:49.800> bake

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:50.160 
when you have it like that you just bake

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:55.430 
when you have it like that you just bake
it<00:04:50.190> and<00:04:52.430> you<00:04:53.430> could<00:04:53.610> gloss<00:04:53.970> it<00:04:54.240> I<00:04:54.390> use<00:04:54.570> gulp<00:04:55.260> the

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
it and you could gloss it I use gulp the

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.570 
it and you could gloss it I use gulp the
gloss<00:04:55.800> and<00:04:56.750> then<00:04:57.750> put<00:04:58.740> alcohol<00:04:58.890> on<00:04:59.190> it<00:04:59.370> so<00:04:59.520> you

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
gloss and then put alcohol on it so you

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.610 
gloss and then put alcohol on it so you
can<00:04:59.640> clean<00:04:59.940> it<00:04:59.970> and<00:05:00.270> that's<00:05:01.110> pretty<00:05:01.350> much<00:05:01.470> how

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
can clean it and that's pretty much how

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:03.050 
can clean it and that's pretty much how
you<00:05:01.650> make<00:05:01.860> it<00:05:02.070> I<00:05:02.340> think<00:05:02.580> I'm<00:05:02.760> calling<00:05:03.000> the

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
you make it I think I'm calling the

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.300 
you make it I think I'm calling the
point
