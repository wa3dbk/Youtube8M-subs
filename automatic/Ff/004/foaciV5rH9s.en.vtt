00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
lift the lid off almost it weights your

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.350 
lift the lid off almost it weights your
iPad<00:00:50.250> which<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.579> really<00:00:50.820> clever<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.300> I'll

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
iPad which is really clever and I'll

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.160 
iPad which is really clever and I'll
show<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> demonstration<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.800> bit

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
show a demonstration of that in a bit

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.080 
show a demonstration of that in a bit
so<00:00:55.170> let's<00:00:55.469> open<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.949> box<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:56.879> pull

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
so let's open the box up you just pull

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.369 
so let's open the box up you just pull
the<00:00:57.270> tab<00:00:57.510> here<00:00:57.920> push<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.070> forward<00:00:59.520> and<00:01:00.379> take

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the tab here push it forward and take

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:05.479 
the tab here push it forward and take
the<00:01:01.410> lid<00:01:01.739> off<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:03.949> we'll<00:01:04.949> put<00:01:05.100> that<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.400> one

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the lid off and we'll put that to one

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.730 
the lid off and we'll put that to one
side<00:01:05.549> and<00:01:07.280> here<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.760> smart<00:01:09.270> case<00:01:09.680> now<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
side and here is the smart case now the

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.039 
side and here is the smart case now the
reason<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:11.490> called<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.909> case<00:01:12.240> and<00:01:12.540> not<00:01:12.720> cover

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
reason it's called a case and not cover

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.429 
reason it's called a case and not cover
is<00:01:13.830> because<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:14.939> the<00:01:15.299> smart<00:01:15.720> cover<00:01:16.140> right

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
is because this is the smart cover right

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.359 
is because this is the smart cover right
here<00:01:16.770> I'll<00:01:17.040> just<00:01:17.340> show<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:18.060> that<00:01:19.159> this<00:01:20.159> is<00:01:20.340> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
here I'll just show you that this is the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.910 
here I'll just show you that this is the
smart<00:01:20.820> cover<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.479> this<00:01:22.110> doesn't<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.710> any

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
smart cover and this doesn't have any

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.760 
smart cover and this doesn't have any
back<00:01:23.189> protection<00:01:23.880> all<00:01:24.270> it<00:01:24.509> does<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:25.020> protect

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
back protection all it does is protect

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.219 
back protection all it does is protect
the<00:01:25.860> front<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.580> iPad<00:01:26.700> Mini<00:01:26.960> as<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.110> can

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
the front of the iPad Mini as you can

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.010 
the front of the iPad Mini as you can
see<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.400> back<00:01:29.610> is<00:01:29.909> left<00:01:30.299> naked<00:01:30.570> and

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
see and the back is left naked and

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.340 
see and the back is left naked and
obviously<00:01:31.799> prone<00:01:32.070> to<00:01:32.220> scratches<00:01:32.729> and<00:01:32.909> damage

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.350 
obviously prone to scratches and damage

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.649 
obviously prone to scratches and damage
however<00:01:34.350> this<00:01:34.619> new<00:01:34.920> case<00:01:35.390> protects<00:01:36.390> the<00:01:36.479> back

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
however this new case protects the back

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.990 
however this new case protects the back
as<00:01:36.960> well<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> has<00:01:37.890> cutouts<00:01:38.490> for<00:01:38.939> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
as well and it has cutouts for the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.660 
as well and it has cutouts for the
camera<00:01:39.600> and<00:01:39.869> also<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.799> new<00:01:40.950> microphone<00:01:41.490> in

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
camera and also the new microphone in

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.370 
camera and also the new microphone in
the<00:01:41.729> iPad<00:01:42.060> Mini<00:01:42.329> retina<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.049> can<00:01:43.200> see

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the iPad Mini retina if you can see

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.700 
the iPad Mini retina if you can see
there<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.630> now<00:01:45.810> we're<00:01:45.930> going<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.110> go<00:01:46.200> ahead<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
there so now we're going to go ahead and

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.609 
there so now we're going to go ahead and
put<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.369> iPad<00:01:47.729> Mini<00:01:47.939> inside<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.869> case<00:01:49.170> but

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
put the iPad Mini inside the case but

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.929 
put the iPad Mini inside the case but
first<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.130> would<00:01:50.280> like<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> stress<00:01:50.880> that

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
first I just would like to stress that

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.510 
first I just would like to stress that
even<00:01:51.390> though<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:52.170> case<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.799> made<00:01:53.130> for<00:01:53.399> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
even though this case is made for the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.850 
even though this case is made for the
new<00:01:53.640> iPad<00:01:54.060> Mini<00:01:54.090> with<00:01:54.600> rest<00:01:54.840> display<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.619> does

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
new iPad Mini with rest display it does

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.840 
new iPad Mini with rest display it does
also<00:01:56.100> fit<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.850> first<00:01:57.180> generation<00:01:57.780> iPad<00:01:58.850> so

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
also fit the first generation iPad so

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.959 
also fit the first generation iPad so
it's<00:02:00.119> very<00:02:00.210> easy<00:02:00.509> to<00:02:00.689> put<00:02:00.899> inside<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.469> case

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
it's very easy to put inside the case

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.880 
it's very easy to put inside the case
the<00:02:02.969> best<00:02:03.149> way<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.360> do<00:02:03.630> it<00:02:03.780> is<00:02:03.930> actually<00:02:04.140> put<00:02:04.799> it

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
the best way to do it is actually put it

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.350 
the best way to do it is actually put it
in<00:02:05.009> kind<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.180> front<00:02:06.689> first<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.439> then<00:02:07.979> down

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
in kind of front first and then down

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.949 
in kind of front first and then down
push<00:02:09.360> it<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:09.629> a<00:02:09.660> bit<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:09.869> force<00:02:10.200> inside<00:02:10.770> and

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
push it with a bit of force inside and

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.030 
push it with a bit of force inside and
there<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.080> go<00:02:13.290> it<00:02:13.530> is<00:02:13.650> full

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
there you go it is full

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.820 
there you go it is full
inside<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.939> inserted<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:16.319> can<00:02:16.349> see<00:02:16.620> there

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
inside and inserted you can see there

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.860 
inside and inserted you can see there
that<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:17.250> lines<00:02:17.549> up<00:02:17.790> with<00:02:18.060> the<00:02:18.540> lightning

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
that it lines up with the lightning

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.240 
that it lines up with the lightning
connector<00:02:19.079> and<00:02:19.379> I'll<00:02:19.439> see<00:02:19.590> all<00:02:19.680> the<00:02:19.799> speakers

first obvious advantages to buying this
iPad<00:02:37.980> Mini<00:02:38.159> smart<00:02:38.459> case<00:02:38.670> is<00:02:38.909> that<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.239> protects

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
iPad Mini smart case is that it protects

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.640 
iPad Mini smart case is that it protects
your<00:02:40.019> iPad<00:02:40.700> 360<00:02:41.700> degrees<00:02:42.030> round<00:02:42.480> what<00:02:43.439> I<00:02:43.500> mean

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
your iPad 360 degrees round what I mean

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.500 
your iPad 360 degrees round what I mean
by<00:02:43.769> that<00:02:43.890> is<00:02:44.129> that<00:02:44.159> it's<00:02:44.489> protecting<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.269> back

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
by that is that it's protecting the back

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.670 
by that is that it's protecting the back
the<00:02:46.019> sides

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the sides

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.030 
the sides
annalee<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.549> front<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.239> that<00:02:48.989> screen<00:02:49.739> which

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
annalee the front of that screen which

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.129 
annalee the front of that screen which
is<00:02:50.159> obviously<00:02:50.430> very<00:02:50.489> prone<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.000> smashing<00:02:51.959> and

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
is obviously very prone to smashing and

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:55.970 
is obviously very prone to smashing and
scratches<00:02:52.680> and<00:02:53.010> when<00:02:53.790> that<00:02:53.940> lid<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.359> closed<00:02:54.980> it

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
scratches and when that lid is closed it

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.770 
scratches and when that lid is closed it
will<00:02:56.250> not<00:02:56.430> smash<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.060> it<00:02:57.150> really<00:02:57.450> really<00:02:57.690> is

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
will not smash and it really really is

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.539 
will not smash and it really really is
good<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.290> that's<00:02:58.470> the<00:02:58.590> first<00:02:58.799> reason<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.370> buy

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
good so that's the first reason to buy

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.729 
good so that's the first reason to buy
this<00:03:00.180> iPad<00:03:00.599> Mini<00:03:00.840> smart<00:03:01.200> case<00:03:01.409> the<00:03:01.500> second

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
this iPad Mini smart case the second

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.110 
this iPad Mini smart case the second
reason<00:03:01.859> is<00:03:02.159> obviously<00:03:02.430> all<00:03:02.609> the<00:03:02.730> features

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
reason is obviously all the features

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.170 
reason is obviously all the features
that<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.359> offers<00:03:03.510> when<00:03:04.349> you<00:03:04.530> open<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.370> case

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
that it offers when you open the case

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.710 
that it offers when you open the case
like<00:03:07.170> so<00:03:07.470> it<00:03:07.859> actually<00:03:08.010> wakes<00:03:08.549> your<00:03:08.849> iPad<00:03:09.299> so

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
like so it actually wakes your iPad so

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.449 
like so it actually wakes your iPad so
it<00:03:09.810> saves<00:03:10.019> you<00:03:10.170> from<00:03:10.290> pressing<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.220> home

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
it saves you from pressing the home

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.660 
it saves you from pressing the home
button<00:03:11.489> or<00:03:11.970> the<00:03:12.090> power<00:03:12.269> button<00:03:12.599> as<00:03:12.750> usual<00:03:13.139> and

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:13.670 
button or the power button as usual and

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.160 
button or the power button as usual and
also<00:03:14.670> works<00:03:14.849> the<00:03:14.940> other<00:03:14.970> way<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.780> that<00:03:15.989> when

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
also works the other way so that when

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.860 
also works the other way so that when
you<00:03:16.379> close<00:03:16.769> the<00:03:17.069> lid<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.940> goes<00:03:18.209> back<00:03:18.449> to<00:03:18.510> sleep

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
you close the lid it goes back to sleep

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.539 
you close the lid it goes back to sleep
without<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.319> turning<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.769> off<00:03:19.919> this<00:03:20.250> smart

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
without you turning it off this smart

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:22.729 
without you turning it off this smart
case<00:03:20.730> is<00:03:20.879> always<00:03:21.150> good<00:03:21.419> to<00:03:21.629> change<00:03:22.169> the<00:03:22.319> angle

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
case is always good to change the angle

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.409 
case is always good to change the angle
of<00:03:22.889> how<00:03:23.040> you're<00:03:23.220> looking<00:03:23.340> at<00:03:23.579> your<00:03:23.730> iPad<00:03:24.000> so

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:24.419 
of how you're looking at your iPad so

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:27.439 
of how you're looking at your iPad so
you<00:03:24.510> can<00:03:24.629> fold<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.139> like<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:25.849> like<00:03:26.849> a<00:03:26.910> triangle

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:27.449 
you can fold it like so like a triangle

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.349 
you can fold it like so like a triangle
which<00:03:27.660> you<00:03:27.780> can<00:03:27.930> see<00:03:28.109> there<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:30.150> can<00:03:30.299> then

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
which you can see there and it can then

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:33.710 
which you can see there and it can then
balance<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.669> there<00:03:32.669> it's<00:03:32.910> just<00:03:33.180> raised<00:03:33.510> off

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
balance and there it's just raised off

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.119 
balance and there it's just raised off
the<00:03:33.750> ground<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:34.169> bit<00:03:34.199> and<00:03:34.590> it's<00:03:34.889> a<00:03:34.949> lot<00:03:35.099> easier

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
the ground a bit and it's a lot easier

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:38.509 
the ground a bit and it's a lot easier
for<00:03:35.879> typing<00:03:36.980> another<00:03:37.980> way<00:03:38.160> this<00:03:38.340> can<00:03:38.489> change

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
for typing another way this can change

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.520 
for typing another way this can change
the<00:03:38.849> angle<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.269> your<00:03:39.329> iPad<00:03:39.750> is<00:03:39.959> if<00:03:40.079> you<00:03:40.199> put<00:03:40.440> it

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
the angle of your iPad is if you put it

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.460 
the angle of your iPad is if you put it
up<00:03:40.650> like<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:41.720> don't<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:42.810> can<00:03:42.959> see<00:03:43.139> there<00:03:43.319> but

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
up like this don't you can see there but
