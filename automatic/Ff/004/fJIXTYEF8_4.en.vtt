weeks<00:00:13.349> we've<00:00:13.559> been<00:00:13.710> talking<00:00:14.040> about<00:00:14.130> vitamin<00:00:14.880> C

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
weeks we've been talking about vitamin C

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.930 
weeks we've been talking about vitamin C
why<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.139> vitamin<00:00:16.740> C<00:00:16.800> good<00:00:17.160> for<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.430> skin<00:00:17.670> I

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
why is vitamin C good for the skin I

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.320 
why is vitamin C good for the skin I
would<00:00:18.119> not<00:00:18.240> have<00:00:18.330> thought<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:19.550> vitamin<00:00:20.550> C<00:00:21.000> is

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
would not have thought that vitamin C is

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.040 
would not have thought that vitamin C is
a<00:00:21.390> required<00:00:22.519> vitamin<00:00:23.519> in<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:24.240> synthesis<00:00:24.840> of

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
a required vitamin in the synthesis of

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.439 
a required vitamin in the synthesis of
the<00:00:25.109> protein<00:00:25.650> collagen<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.910> protein

the protein collagen and the protein
collagen<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.289> required<00:00:28.710> for<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.189> integrity

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
collagen is required for the integrity

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
vitamin C in the diet and again since we

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.040 
vitamin C in the diet and again since we
don't<00:00:49.440> make<00:00:49.829> vitamin<00:00:50.610> C<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.270> need<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.840> take

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
don't make vitamin C and we need to take

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.029 
don't make vitamin C and we need to take
that<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.440> on<00:00:52.559> our<00:00:52.680> foods<00:00:53.010> or<00:00:53.309> our<00:00:53.670> supplements

that in on our foods or our supplements

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:57.529 
that in on our foods or our supplements
supplementing<00:00:56.039> with<00:00:56.190> vitamin<00:00:56.250> C<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.270> very

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
supplementing with vitamin C can be very

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.080 
supplementing with vitamin C can be very
important<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.469> maintaining<00:00:59.090> collagen

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
important to maintaining collagen

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.959 
important to maintaining collagen
synthesis<00:01:00.750> and<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:01.859> health<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.430> skin<00:01:02.550> and

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
synthesis and the health of the skin and

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.250 
synthesis and the health of the skin and
may<00:01:03.600> also<00:01:03.809> contribute<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.830> wound<00:01:05.339> healing

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
may also contribute to wound healing

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.750 
may also contribute to wound healing
collagen<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.409> about<00:01:07.680> one<00:01:07.950> third<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.549> body

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
collagen is about one third of the body

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.719 
collagen is about one third of the body
protein<00:01:09.350> it's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.470> protein<00:01:10.860> it's<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.250> protein

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
protein it's a protein it's a protein

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.810 
protein it's a protein it's a protein
and<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.630> represents<00:01:13.229> about<00:01:13.350> one<00:01:13.770> third<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.610> all

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
and it represents about one third of all

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.090 
and it represents about one third of all
of<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.360> protein<00:01:15.840> we<00:01:16.020> make<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.380> our<00:01:16.530> body<00:01:16.740> and

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
of the protein we make in our body and

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.280 
of the protein we make in our body and
so<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.490> production<00:01:17.939> and<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.299> skin<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:18.930> our

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
so the production and the skin is our

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.800 
so the production and the skin is our
largest<00:01:19.320> organ<00:01:19.890> it<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.060> covers<00:01:21.450> our<00:01:21.600> whole

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
largest organ it is it covers our whole

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.429 
largest organ it is it covers our whole
body<00:01:22.049> so<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:23.280> you<00:01:23.729> are<00:01:24.030> lacking<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.720> vitamin<00:01:25.170> C

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
body so if you are lacking in vitamin C

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.030 
body so if you are lacking in vitamin C
your<00:01:26.189> skin<00:01:26.610> your<00:01:27.210> collagen<00:01:27.780> production<00:01:28.040> may

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
your skin your collagen production may

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.060 
your skin your collagen production may
not<00:01:29.250> maintain<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.060> health<00:01:30.299> of<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.810> skin<00:01:31.170> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
not maintain the health of the skin and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.280 
not maintain the health of the skin and
you<00:01:32.250> may<00:01:32.549> have<00:01:32.790> problems<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.780> wound<00:01:34.020> healing

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
you may have problems in wound healing

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.490 
you may have problems in wound healing
therefore<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.100> important<00:01:35.640> to<00:01:36.540> take<00:01:37.320> in

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
therefore it's important to take in

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.350 
therefore it's important to take in
enough<00:01:37.770> vitamin<00:01:38.280> C<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.700> maintain<00:01:39.180> that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
enough vitamin C to maintain that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.230 
enough vitamin C to maintain that
collagen<00:01:39.900> synthesis<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:41.040> say<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.729> wound

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
collagen synthesis you say that wound

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.960 
collagen synthesis you say that wound
healing<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.840> an<00:01:42.930> effect<00:01:43.290> of<00:01:43.500> taking<00:01:43.970> adequate

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
healing is an effect of taking adequate

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.760 
healing is an effect of taking adequate
vitamin<00:01:45.090> C<00:01:45.570> have<00:01:45.869> there<00:01:46.079> been<00:01:46.259> studies<00:01:46.380> to

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
vitamin C have there been studies to

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.980 
vitamin C have there been studies to
show<00:01:46.979> that<00:01:47.009> this<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.460> effective<00:01:48.030> yes<00:01:48.659> there

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
show that this is effective yes there

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.450 
show that this is effective yes there
are<00:01:49.020> many<00:01:49.880> events<00:01:50.880> involved<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:52.460> wound

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
are many events involved in wound

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.330 
are many events involved in wound
healing<00:01:53.759> mm-hmm<00:01:54.740> some<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.890> those<00:01:56.009> events

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
healing mm-hmm some of those events

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.730 
healing mm-hmm some of those events
especially<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.299> production<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.110> deposition

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
especially the production and deposition

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.670 
especially the production and deposition
of<00:01:58.860> collagen<00:01:59.549> is<00:01:59.729> an<00:02:00.180> important<00:02:00.780> step<00:02:01.229> first

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
of collagen is an important step first

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.789 
of collagen is an important step first
step<00:02:01.950> in<00:02:02.159> wound<00:02:02.369> healing

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
step in wound healing

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:05.459 
step in wound healing
so<00:02:03.729> while<00:02:03.939> there<00:02:04.119> are<00:02:04.240> many<00:02:04.539> things<00:02:04.719> required

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:05.469 
so while there are many things required

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:08.249 
so while there are many things required
for<00:02:05.829> wound<00:02:06.009> healing<00:02:06.179> certainly<00:02:07.179> vitamin<00:02:07.810> C<00:02:08.080> is

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
for wound healing certainly vitamin C is

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.250 
for wound healing certainly vitamin C is
one<00:02:08.709> of<00:02:09.039> those<00:02:09.640> essential<00:02:10.209> components<00:02:11.019> in<00:02:11.140> the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
one of those essential components in the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.470 
one of those essential components in the
diet<00:02:11.500> which<00:02:12.220> would<00:02:12.430> contribute<00:02:12.849> towards
