00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.740
 hello to all of you guys for found in 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.170
 this new video show down on the 23rd and the 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.969
 first of a 2015 vgc season 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.890
 it's not just a note but we want to make you 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.449
 see some combos that already come 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.160
 used in this put in why 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.140
 it will not be a mm bisbee time but a meet 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.970
 again of the combo that we will see is not known 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.619
 however boys are almost like years 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.510
 bacall usual historical kat 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.340
 and here it comes well so we are there 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.650
 max at power at the bottom our friend 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.600
 bach against home keys on the keyboard 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.670
 therefore one of the first challenges we have 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.079
 do is one of manila theories 15 we are 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.670
 we too begin to settle in 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.010
 po to this new half game and I have to 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.920
 see the two teams already say a 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.140
 regardless of which still grows LIA land 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.690
 horus totem and in this period silvio 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.180
 there are those who really are in all of his 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.670
 great specs or life hours to the use of 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.590
 guys so be prepared for spam 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.510
 total of these pokemon clearly i 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.710
 legendary seeds point as land horus 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.530
 tum tum blues tornados class ii a 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.330
 etc. etc. that the trams a ci 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.950
 many will be seen coming too 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.960
 because they still have some statistics 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.000
 also of the absurd truth therefore i 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.070
 guys how was the vcc 2013 these 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.710
 pokémon in short, they saw it in the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.570
 great here the boys we go immediately to 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.860
 see this challenge say something 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.070
 on the team we say it 's a team 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.729
 a little thrown in there and if my run that 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.140
 if you see an intersse that I think will be 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.119
 penny going on maybe in 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.579
 percentage of use however I need 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.380
 secrets for the sun because you believe it 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.780
 little bit more used we will see why 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.640
 never in this video will not be revealed 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.170
 return from the other side we see one 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.960
 a little more standard team let's see 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.080
 always as silvio said 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.390
 the adoro sto de maria macrì will put the 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.130
 mens that is one of the most frequent this 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.570
 period like me that we say the new ones 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.000
 mega let's say that mega dining hall is 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.530
 definitely seen and revised as always 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.790
 agazzi we remember seeing that the show down 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.020
 and we haven't done that for a while 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.759
 it is a way for us as always of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.140
 exchange information with the idea 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.940
 teams then in the comments if you have 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.440
 need anything about 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.610
 teams we're paying presented 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.009
 seeing right now if you can 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.929
 ask you let's tell you a little about the set of 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.390
 pokémon based on your interests 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.470
 we say to say and to play to go 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.600
 immediately to see what happens inside 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.550
 holland rooster ryan then totem e 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.470
 will grow from the side of letter keyboards 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.750
 at home on the keyboard and land horus is 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.530
 always totems and letters on the keyboard 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.959
 rightly and cruz on the side of baku 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.070
 here in return and let me live honey 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.440
 a landslide that comes among other things 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.019
 powered by a helping hand to crash and 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.880
 it is rightly so for me it doesn't do much though 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.950
 I immediately have a newco that despite 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.750
 one less attack that allows 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.760
 take him more than half because he 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.530
 remains inhabited yellow I take the leftovers from him 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.569
 look at that deprivation guys in 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.579
 this is me the gamer and rarely mum 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.860
 my I see you so many smooth 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:52.950
 mom my really devastating stuff you 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:55.049
 leaves of sculli tato disabled design e 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.269
 therefore unfortunately hesitation for 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.980
 the andosilla but would model the 6 e 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.900
 mail grows send them ko 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.579
 here another ace bim always on the side 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.209
 of yours grows on their arms and 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.130
 purely defensive really in attack 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.290
 special if not four and enter 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.530
 finally your friend stolen room 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.760
 Persian that you want to choose becomes 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:16.680
 also exactly as we have said a 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:19.079
 Persian rocks live rug clearly 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.079
 si à sucre xeliac both on camera a little 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.700
 even for too much in attack is done 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.680
 also because if land caliphate is landed 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.170
 so it always rocks rocks and forced 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.570
 but ten makes the called camero waver 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.579
 fortunately it will grow between while out 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.500
 put others with as we know room 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:36.269
 let's say that in this moment game is one 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.250
 of the best pokémon that can be 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.410
 played in the trick room is definitely 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.290
 very very good also castella with 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.910
 helping hand can stand it as you see 

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.530
 lion make a nice heat wave that he sent 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:49.130
 just so because it is enhanced 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.050
 by ability brute strength because 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.570
 hot wave in addition to all the possibilities 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.220
 to burn is therefore no longer burning 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.690
 is enhanced by skill and video 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:58.940
 boosted by helping hand and then 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.290
 let's say from news ahead of at least three 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.270
 there is the tritium so we will attack 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.640
 always for our very cameron 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:06.200
 I will probably be the first to attack here 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.060
 I expected a burned camero 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.100
 lion tells me a but no it is impossible if 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.870
 it is not Naples, but he is not right 

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:14.600
 made a nice burn on camero that 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:17.540
 I protected myself because I presented 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:19.250
 just his action and it happens to me 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.739
 I'm allowed to give him a nice tour was 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.290
 social class hoeness because sa mens mega 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:26.180
 evolved to more physical defense than defense 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.990
 special so the day went on 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:29.120
 more than good 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.160
 they are not your boys did not happen 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.900
 immediately thaw immediately 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.650
 you if it doesn't do much air but yes 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.570
 it burns thanks to its flame of law job 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:40.430
 special remember that he knows but can't 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:43.640
 be played physically we are not and a lot 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.410
 people you are perhaps in my opinion mega physical 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.270
 Canteen makes more because it is a 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.980
 But if really press attack 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.630
 the subject burns and at 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.910
 concerns with using facade 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:56.060
 however it is empowered by his life 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:59.360
 it then becomes he responds with 1 kraft 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:01.520
 unfortunately, however, the most hot wave 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.050
 rejection then sends him head 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.480
 despite the healthy mega you have not seen 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:08.050
 that a click room together camero that one 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.640
 of the pokémon that is accompanied better 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.100
 playing in three chrome is really 

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.350
 actual obvious is not the law because there 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:17.570
 there are so many teams even if you are 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.610
 many bockmanns repeat, so there are 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.320
 at least six seven eight pokémon yes 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.690
 they always repeat because rossetto is up 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.910
 who saw familiars first in the smog 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.540
 onda ball then there is a tempa ue spam 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.150
 rais 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.560
 however beware of the ice that 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:32.270
 it's really important then guys 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.800
 question in the comments face well if you have 

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.960
 some question this is the 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.790
 23rd showdown episodes that like 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.440
 you see it has changed its appearance since yes 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.750
 now changes meta game then all the 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.460
 red veil bad so guys there 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:45.260
 let 's see the next episode says by one 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:46.550
 any other video that will come out as 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.140
 always if you liked to leave us a nice 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:49.580
 I like it I loved leaving ourselves 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:51.790
 like and see you at the next video 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.790
 Hello
