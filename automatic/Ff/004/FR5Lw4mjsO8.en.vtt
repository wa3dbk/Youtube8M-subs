up from being Q they currently have a

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.249 
up from being Q they currently have a
new<00:00:08.189> range<00:00:08.519> out<00:00:08.849> as<00:00:09.570> you<00:00:09.809> can<00:00:09.929> see<00:00:10.080> they're

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:10.259 
new range out as you can see they're

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.579 
new range out as you can see they're
really<00:00:10.410> colorful<00:00:10.679> and<00:00:11.249> I<00:00:11.580> just<00:00:11.849> love<00:00:12.150> them

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:12.589 
really colorful and I just love them

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:15.949 
really colorful and I just love them
they<00:00:13.589> do<00:00:13.650> them<00:00:13.860> in<00:00:13.950> two<00:00:14.070> different<00:00:14.249> sizes<00:00:14.959> this

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:15.959 
they do them in two different sizes this

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.890 
they do them in two different sizes this
was<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.260> size<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.590> got<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:16.950> think<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.310> was<00:00:17.460> 66<00:00:18.120> 66

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
was the size I got I think it was 66 66

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.430 
was the size I got I think it was 66 66
across<00:00:19.350> and<00:00:19.740> 75<00:00:20.700> down<00:00:21.110> they<00:00:22.110> didn't<00:00:22.350> do

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
across and 75 down they didn't do

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.550 
across and 75 down they didn't do
anything<00:00:22.710> shorter<00:00:23.280> though<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:24.260> this<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.440> my

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
anything shorter though so this is my

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.090 
anything shorter though so this is my
old<00:00:25.770> pair<00:00:26.070> as<00:00:26.760> you<00:00:26.880> can<00:00:27.030> see<00:00:27.530> as<00:00:28.530> you<00:00:28.710> can<00:00:28.860> see

going to get a biro and just mark off

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.209 
going to get a biro and just mark off
very<00:00:55.440> lightly<00:00:55.789> where<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:56.819> need<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.479> cut<00:00:58.190> so<00:00:59.190> that

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
very lightly where I need to cut so that

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.139 
very lightly where I need to cut so that
is<00:00:59.550> just<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.999> rough<00:01:00.300> guide<00:01:00.719> as<00:01:01.260> you<00:01:01.979> can<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.370> an

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
is just a rough guide as you can see an

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.240 
is just a rough guide as you can see an
April<00:01:03.479> you're<00:01:03.600> thinking<00:01:03.929> you<00:01:04.500> really<00:01:04.710> needed

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
April you're thinking you really needed

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.260 
April you're thinking you really needed
space<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:06.030> turn<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.689> up<00:01:06.810> which<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:07.950> true

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
space to turn it up which is so true

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.120 
space to turn it up which is so true
however<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.600> found<00:01:09.810> these<00:01:10.020> ones<00:01:10.229> very<00:01:10.500> long

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
however I found these ones very long

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.179 
however I found these ones very long
anyway<00:01:11.450> bit<00:01:12.450> longer<00:01:12.780> than<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.079> wanted<00:01:13.619> so<00:01:14.009> what

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
anyway bit longer than I wanted so what

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.830 
anyway bit longer than I wanted so what
I'm<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.520> do<00:01:14.729> I'm<00:01:14.969> going<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.600> measure

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
I'm going to do I'm going to measure

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.660 
I'm going to do I'm going to measure
about<00:01:16.560> two<00:01:16.920> inches<00:01:17.280> from<00:01:17.789> that<00:01:17.880> line<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:19.670> put

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
about two inches from that line and put

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.789 
about two inches from that line and put
a<00:01:20.700> little<00:01:20.820> marking<00:01:21.479> where<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.049> want<00:01:22.289> to<00:01:22.469> fold<00:01:22.680> it

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
a little marking where I want to fold it

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.389 
a little marking where I want to fold it
up<00:01:22.920> so<00:01:23.399> that's<00:01:24.000> my<00:01:24.240> little<00:01:24.600> two<00:01:24.840> inch<00:01:24.869> line<00:01:25.399> two

00:01:26.389 --> 00:01:26.399 
up so that's my little two inch line two

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:28.580 
up so that's my little two inch line two
inch<00:01:26.520> mark<00:01:26.909> from<00:01:27.210> down<00:01:27.390> there<00:01:27.600> I'm<00:01:28.439> actually

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
inch mark from down there I'm actually

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.580 
inch mark from down there I'm actually
going<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.979> move<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.399> down<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:31.229> do

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
going to move this down so I can do

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.170 
going to move this down so I can do
another<00:01:31.920> straight<00:01:32.310> line<00:01:32.490> all<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.880> way<00:01:32.909> across

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
another straight line all the way across

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.090 
another straight line all the way across
so<00:01:33.539> that<00:01:33.990> is<00:01:34.170> my<00:01:34.409> two<00:01:34.469> inch<00:01:34.799> line<00:01:35.039> done<00:01:37.009> now<00:01:38.009> I'm

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
so that is my two inch line done now I'm

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.130 
so that is my two inch line done now I'm
going<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.310> use<00:01:38.340> my<00:01:38.640> fabric<00:01:39.060> scissors<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.570> cut

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
going to use my fabric scissors and cut

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.760 
going to use my fabric scissors and cut
along<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:41.189> line<00:01:41.490> so<00:01:41.789> I've<00:01:42.600> cut<00:01:42.899> along<00:01:43.170> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
along this line so I've cut along the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.580 
along this line so I've cut along the
line<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:45.090> now<00:01:45.240> I've<00:01:45.420> got<00:01:45.630> my<00:01:45.750> raw<00:01:45.990> edge<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
line so now I've got my raw edge and

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.709 
line so now I've got my raw edge and
what<00:01:47.310> I'm<00:01:47.399> basically<00:01:47.820> going<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.149> do<00:01:48.329> all<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:48.719 
what I'm basically going to do all the

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:51.679 
what I'm basically going to do all the
way<00:01:48.840> along<00:01:49.079> I<00:01:49.409> am<00:01:50.039> going<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.609> fold<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.270> in<00:01:51.420> like

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
way along I am going to fold it in like

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.520 
way along I am going to fold it in like
this<00:01:53.299> so<00:01:54.299> it's<00:01:54.450> really<00:01:54.659> hard<00:01:54.869> doing<00:01:55.079> on<00:01:55.289> hand

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
this so it's really hard doing on hand

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.060 
this so it's really hard doing on hand
and<00:01:55.740> then<00:01:56.310> I'm<00:01:56.490> going<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> fold<00:01:56.969> up<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:58.070> the

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
and then I'm going to fold up on the

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.560 
and then I'm going to fold up on the
line<00:02:00.590> like<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:02.999> going<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.179> look<00:02:03.359> like

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
line like so so it's going to look like

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:12.700 
line like so so it's going to look like
a<00:02:03.659> neat<00:02:03.869> edge

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.950 

so<00:02:13.710> if<00:02:13.890> you<00:02:14.010> get<00:02:14.190> to<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.430> end<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.970> you<00:02:15.330> find<00:02:15.660> it

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
so if you get to the end and you find it

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.580 
so if you get to the end and you find it
a<00:02:16.320> little<00:02:16.410> bit<00:02:17.070> long<00:02:17.310> you<00:02:18.030> kind<00:02:18.270> of

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
a little bit long you kind of

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.590 
a little bit long you kind of
overlapping<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.890> bit<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.790> best<00:02:20.970> thing<00:02:21.210> to<00:02:21.240> do

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
overlapping a bit the best thing to do

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.640 
overlapping a bit the best thing to do
is<00:02:22.340> just<00:02:23.340> cut<00:02:23.880> it<00:02:24.060> off<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.600> so<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.620> looks

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
is just cut it off like that so it looks

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.350 
is just cut it off like that so it looks
like<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.130> I<00:02:26.160> basically<00:02:26.460> cut<00:02:26.940> it<00:02:27.030> cut<00:02:27.300> the

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
like that I basically cut it cut the

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.500 
like that I basically cut it cut the
corner<00:02:27.720> off<00:02:27.750> I<00:02:28.670> fold<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.820> over<00:02:30.000> and<00:02:30.120> tucked<00:02:30.360> it

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
corner off I fold it over and tucked it

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.240 
corner off I fold it over and tucked it
in<00:02:30.630> just<00:02:30.930> so<00:02:31.050> it's<00:02:31.200> not<00:02:31.320> really<00:02:31.740> overlapping

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
in just so it's not really overlapping

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.270 
in just so it's not really overlapping
and<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:34.290> so<00:02:35.160> that<00:02:35.460> is<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:36.420> lines<00:02:36.690> done<00:02:37.280> I'm

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
and you so that is the lines done I'm

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.890 
and you so that is the lines done I'm
now<00:02:38.580> going<00:02:38.820> to<00:02:38.880> do<00:02:39.060> my<00:02:39.300> other<00:02:40.610> curtain<00:02:41.900> using

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
now going to do my other curtain using

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.260 
now going to do my other curtain using
this<00:02:43.050> guide<00:02:43.410> so<00:02:43.850> I'm<00:02:44.850> going<00:02:45.000> to<00:02:45.060> do<00:02:45.150> exactly

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
this guide so I'm going to do exactly

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.400 
this guide so I'm going to do exactly
the<00:02:45.600> same<00:02:45.920> I'm<00:02:46.920> going<00:02:47.280> to<00:02:47.690> draw<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.720> line<00:02:48.900> all

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
the same I'm going to draw a line all

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.290 
the same I'm going to draw a line all
the<00:02:49.560> way<00:02:49.590> across<00:02:49.770> again<00:02:50.220> and<00:02:50.430> another<00:02:51.090> two

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
the way across again and another two

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.980 
the way across again and another two
inches<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:52.490> cut<00:02:53.490> like<00:02:54.300> I<00:02:54.450> did<00:02:54.600> before

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
inches and cut like I did before

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.310 
inches and cut like I did before
so<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.590> looks<00:02:55.770> like<00:02:56.040> that<00:02:57.140> I'm<00:02:58.140> actually

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
so that looks like that I'm actually

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.440 
so that looks like that I'm actually
going<00:02:58.590> to<00:02:58.650> sew<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.070> one<00:02:59.280> first<00:02:59.550> because<00:03:00.330> I've

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
going to sew this one first because I've

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.960 
going to sew this one first because I've
run<00:03:00.600> out<00:03:00.660> of<00:03:00.780> pins<00:03:01.250> so<00:03:02.250> I'm<00:03:02.460> going<00:03:02.640> to<00:03:02.670> sew<00:03:02.850> this

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
run out of pins so I'm going to sew this

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.330 
run out of pins so I'm going to sew this
one<00:03:03.180> first<00:03:03.390> and<00:03:03.750> then<00:03:03.930> I'll<00:03:04.050> fold<00:03:04.920> this<00:03:05.100> one<00:03:05.280> up

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
one first and then I'll fold this one up

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.240 
one first and then I'll fold this one up
afterwards<00:03:06.330> so<00:03:06.840> onto<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.260> machine<00:03:07.650> this<00:03:08.010> is

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
afterwards so onto the machine this is

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.960 
afterwards so onto the machine this is
the<00:03:08.340> machine<00:03:08.520> I<00:03:08.820> have<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.270> brother<00:03:10.970> that's

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
the machine I have it's brother that's

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:15.199 
the machine I have it's brother that's
the<00:03:12.180> code<00:03:12.420> it<00:03:12.989> does<00:03:13.410> everything<00:03:14.340> useful<00:03:14.880> for

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
the code it does everything useful for

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:17.240 
the code it does everything useful for
me<00:03:15.360> I've<00:03:15.570> never<00:03:16.380> had<00:03:16.590> any<00:03:16.709> problems<00:03:17.010> with<00:03:17.040> it

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
me I've never had any problems with it

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.310 
me I've never had any problems with it
I've<00:03:17.310> had<00:03:17.400> it<00:03:17.520> for<00:03:17.640> a<00:03:17.670> few<00:03:17.850> years<00:03:17.880> now<00:03:18.030> and<00:03:18.510> the

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
I've had it for a few years now and the

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.060 
I've had it for a few years now and the
stitching<00:03:19.830> I'm<00:03:19.950> using<00:03:20.220> is<00:03:20.610> -<00:03:21.120> I<00:03:21.739> want<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.800> to<00:03:22.950> be

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
stitching I'm using is - I want it to be

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:27.460 
stitching I'm using is - I want it to be
quite<00:03:23.750> tight<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:25.709> know<00:03:25.860> so<00:03:26.100> it<00:03:26.310> really<00:03:26.820> holds

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
quite tight you know so it really holds

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.040 
quite tight you know so it really holds
it<00:03:28.470> well<00:03:28.739> and<00:03:29.070> I've<00:03:29.190> actually<00:03:29.720> you<00:03:30.720> know<00:03:30.840> don't

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
it well and I've actually you know don't

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.960 
it well and I've actually you know don't
I'll<00:03:31.200> test<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.680> on<00:03:31.830> another<00:03:32.730> piece<00:03:32.940> of

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
I'll test it on another piece of

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.990 
I'll test it on another piece of
material<00:03:33.650> so<00:03:34.650> start<00:03:35.070> from<00:03:35.100> whatever<00:03:35.400> end<00:03:35.790> you

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
material so start from whatever end you

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.940 
material so start from whatever end you
like<00:03:36.209> I'm<00:03:36.480> starting<00:03:36.930> from<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.230> end<00:03:37.380> which<00:03:37.739> I

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
like I'm starting from the end which I

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.530 
like I'm starting from the end which I
cut<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.310> corner<00:03:38.640> off<00:03:38.670> and<00:03:39.120> I'm<00:03:39.180> going<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.360> go

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
cut the corner off and I'm going to go

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.470 
cut the corner off and I'm going to go
up<00:03:39.750> the<00:03:39.959> corner<00:03:40.320> and<00:03:40.470> like<00:03:41.070> this<00:03:41.360> remember<00:03:42.360> to

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
up the corner and like this remember to

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.000 
up the corner and like this remember to
take<00:03:42.630> your<00:03:42.660> pins<00:03:43.050> out<00:03:43.200> as<00:03:43.410> you<00:03:43.530> go<00:03:43.709> otherwise

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
take your pins out as you go otherwise

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.190 
take your pins out as you go otherwise
you<00:03:44.220> don't<00:03:44.340> want<00:03:44.520> to<00:03:44.580> damage<00:03:44.850> your<00:03:45.300> needle

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.130 

make<00:03:52.200> sure<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.590> sew<00:03:52.830> as<00:03:53.010> closely<00:03:53.370> to<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.510> edge

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
make sure you sew as closely to the edge

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.490 
make sure you sew as closely to the edge
as<00:03:55.380> possible<00:03:55.800> it<00:03:56.010> once<00:03:56.990> one<00:03:57.990> cut<00:03:58.230> and<00:03:58.260> done

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
as possible it once one cut and done

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.100 
as possible it once one cut and done
simple<00:03:59.450> how<00:04:00.450> easy<00:04:00.780> was<00:04:01.230> that<00:04:02.690> and<00:04:03.690> that's<00:04:03.930> how

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
simple how easy was that and that's how

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:09.220 
simple how easy was that and that's how
the<00:04:04.170> end<00:04:04.410> looks<00:04:07.100> so<00:04:08.100> both<00:04:08.430> of<00:04:08.459> them<00:04:08.700> are<00:04:08.940> done

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
the end looks so both of them are done

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.420 
the end looks so both of them are done
now<00:04:10.230> I'm<00:04:10.350> going<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.590> give<00:04:10.709> them<00:04:10.860> both<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.220> good

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
now I'm going to give them both a good

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.300 
now I'm going to give them both a good
iron<00:04:11.670> and<00:04:12.030> that's<00:04:12.630> them<00:04:12.959> done<00:04:13.470> you<00:04:14.100> wouldn't

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
iron and that's them done you wouldn't

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.930 
iron and that's them done you wouldn't
even<00:04:14.370> think<00:04:14.550> they<00:04:14.940> were<00:04:15.000> taken<00:04:15.570> up<00:04:15.690> at<00:04:15.810> all
