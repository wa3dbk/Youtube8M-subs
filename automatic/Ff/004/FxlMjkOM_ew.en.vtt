00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:58.350
 really the difference 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:04.530
 my 64 mega graphics card 798 and me 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.390

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.280
 there ne 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.350
 Let's start here. The video will stay. 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.330
 that beauty with the whole square face 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.470
 because we're going to have to restart the 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.530
 computer that we are going to have to do 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:19.350
 I'll tell you first of all for 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.220
 people do not get cursed came the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.670
 computer and when it is opening 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.990
 the delete key or when it was 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.720
 hold down the delete key 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.500
 it appeared a page with several 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.869
 options 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.610
 Then I'll show the rest then. 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:45.350
 now even told the world is to get everyone here 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:48.899
 or the thing is too far from the tv 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.610
 in this case the note does not pay the way 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:54.360
 what is here on my computer from 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:57.630

 here is graphical memory 7 98 memory 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:54.860
 64 mega video and the system will share 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:57.470
 784 average so let's talk it 's a 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:04.640
