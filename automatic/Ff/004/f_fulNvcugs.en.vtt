darker leaf with a red vein that goes
through<00:01:05.640> them<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.270> they're<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> little<00:01:06.750> bit

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
through them so they're a little bit

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.010 
through them so they're a little bit
more<00:01:07.020> dramatic<00:01:07.950> so<00:01:08.250> question<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.390> our<00:01:09.570> prevent

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
more dramatic so question is our prevent

more dramatic so question is our prevent
our<00:01:10.260> impatience<00:01:10.770> perennial<00:01:11.760> or<00:01:11.970> are<00:01:12.210> they

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
our impatience perennial or are they

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.560 
our impatience perennial or are they
annuals<00:01:13.080> now<00:01:13.710> as<00:01:13.920> you<00:01:14.070> know<00:01:14.280> an<00:01:14.670> annual<00:01:15.270> flower

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
impatience will act as perennials which

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.910 
impatience will act as perennials which
means<00:01:53.790> they<00:01:54.509> may<00:01:54.720> get<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.899> little<00:01:55.110> bit<00:01:55.350> leggy<00:01:55.619> or

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
means they may get a little bit leggy or

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.380 
means they may get a little bit leggy or
a<00:01:55.950> little<00:01:56.130> bit<00:01:56.250> sad<00:01:56.549> when<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.000> weather<00:01:57.149> gets

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
cold but as it warms up again they will

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.440 
cold but as it warms up again they will
come<00:02:00.450> back<00:02:00.659> and<00:02:01.020> rebloom<00:02:01.590> each<00:02:01.920> year<00:02:02.460> if<00:02:02.670> you

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
come back and rebloom each year if you

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.060 
come back and rebloom each year if you
happen<00:02:03.780> to<00:02:03.810> live<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.079> an<00:02:04.229> area<00:02:04.439> where<00:02:04.740> you<00:02:04.860> do

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
get a hard frost then impatience will

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.550 
get a hard frost then impatience will
act<00:02:08.399> more<00:02:08.520> like<00:02:08.729> annuals<00:02:09.539> where

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
act more like annuals where

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.850 
act more like annuals where
they<00:02:10.649> will<00:02:11.060> die<00:02:12.060> after<00:02:12.390> that<00:02:12.930> first<00:02:13.530> hard

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
they will die after that first hard

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.680 
they will die after that first hard
Frost<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.580> you'll<00:02:14.700> have<00:02:14.880> to<00:02:15.030> remove<00:02:15.330> them<00:02:15.540> and

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
Frost and you'll have to remove them and
