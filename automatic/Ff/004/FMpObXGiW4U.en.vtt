 nakheel of the pillory and as everything goes better 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.779
 so if m toussaint 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.510
 She is a 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.780
 when a dog l auvergne 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.170
 so that m 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.460
 like celine 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 john holmes i'm pretty disappointed 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.230
 nobody 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.880
 Saturday it's my favorite movie that alcohol 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.650
 for sure I will never evolve 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.220
 the powers 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.780
 and henri 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.760
 look no further 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.760
 this same desire has even known desirable 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.140
 it's all new 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.070
 soccer 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.070
 at first I did not really like to put myself in danger 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.100
 how to do it myself is a bit painful comscore 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.020
 So here we go 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.050
 wilkes booth book signings laptop all look for excuses I was looking for 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.210
 not to undo what m 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.210
 love him what she's looking for even more 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.110
 seriously she shows how 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.070
 at most level 30 m the fact that this search with the boom in more fluid 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.850
 and his allies had written m we are very quiet 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:41.970
 so this question either 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.340
 rather good press 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.340
 in doubt 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.070
 the sea and that for a war crime the speech in clear 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.850
 jules and jim of truffaut movie 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.850
 falling asleep victory would make sense 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.770
 long-term news story 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.770
 to capture it it's true that you offer me in life 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:17.659
 places 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.989
 maybe the quality tourism new cases and I am very moved 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:25.659
 the moving 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.839
 dubois ktm 

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:31.139
 they have only here the world 

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.269
 Great 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.269
 for cadbury a human epic 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:41.469
 those who were punctual pokemon 

00:02:41.469 --> 00:02:44.219
 for 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.219
 it's from Greece that generates 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:54.169
 why so much attention to detail 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:58.259
 but frankly it is rather beautiful and tasteful everyone wins 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.019
 but it's just that I did not want it 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:03.939
 the poland 

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.219
 deceived husband 

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:08.419
 I think I could have done for research 

00:03:08.419 --> 00:03:11.419
 we all know each other 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.979
 the framing is a little too cool or a tiny island 

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:23.089
 the boulou 

00:03:23.849 --> 00:03:26.849
 the nist re 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.179
 then the excess 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:33.839
 but still 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.839
 the controller a charge for assault and battery 

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:41.829
 the victim 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.829
 so to sum up the latter so that m 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:48.279
 you have an iphone 

00:03:48.279 --> 00:03:51.279
 so that the tip of his nose in 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.420
 on Wednesday, July 28th the idea two thirty-one miniseries find 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.439
 a better life 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.329
 he does not think 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.339
 no less 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:05.880
 in this ministry 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.880
 you can bet nature 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:14.709
 demir 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:15.739
 half-hour 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.739
 the turn 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:23.879
 you are at home at the touch and so you exaggerate if he is a 

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:24.749
 obligation 

00:04:24.749 --> 00:04:27.050
 the file 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:28.120
 in China 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.999
 those countries 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:32.650
 m 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.650
 in putting it in first position 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:39.919
 but at the end of the meeting for proof November 12 

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:46.909
 this new shot what are you 

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:49.909
 we believe it's done it's very long 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.960
 a necessity we do not know what 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.610
 malagasy-Malagasy 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.379
 for the summer this role 

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.610
 for once the head of poland your driving 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.870
 it's not known it's a shame for umx 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:12.550
 he was a victim 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.550
 luc adolphe we cry our cornerbacks 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.779
 so it's a good 

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:20.939
 he is very good 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:23.939
 see him push back 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.419
 the rest they will not push that gives 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:33.120
 yes we know that you 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:34.469
 Anne Sophie 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.469
 it's a natural exaggeration that one might be required the crime 

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:45.849
 m 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:48.849
 a lot to do 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:52.659
 could show himself 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.830
 places 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.830
 m he uses coffee lovers 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.589
 in charge 

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:04.759
 the couple 

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:07.759
 so here I am going to receive some music fan 

00:06:10.099 --> 00:06:13.119
 in dedication of my deep 

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:16.570
 I wanted he is more than likely 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:17.930
 a bit like me 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.470
 and not the reverse of the less young the real say besides paul would have found 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.309
 found in a young 

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:28.349
 I second chance our observation 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.319
 m 

00:06:31.319 --> 00:06:33.360
 University 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.680

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.419
 she 

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:40.409
 how 

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:43.319

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.369
 greenyellow 

00:06:44.369 --> 00:06:47.369

 Alex Young at the end of skinning in her mouth 

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:56.530

 it's about local 

00:06:58.869 --> 00:07:01.619
 we finish them 

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:04.619
 further discussions 

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:08.330
