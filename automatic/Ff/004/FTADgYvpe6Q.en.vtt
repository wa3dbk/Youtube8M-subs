motor break in some of these except for

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.350 
motor break in some of these except for
with<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.170> magnets<00:01:22.560> now<00:01:23.159> some<00:01:23.790> audio<00:01:24.060> files

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
with the magnets now some audio files

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.760 
with the magnets now some audio files
will<00:01:24.450> say<00:01:24.540> oh<00:01:24.689> my<00:01:24.900> god<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.439> biggest

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
thing that ever happens in that world

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.749 
thing that ever happens in that world
you<00:01:27.240> must<00:01:27.420> break<00:01:27.659> them<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.049> it's<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:29.310> me<00:01:29.460> it's

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
you must break them in it's to me it's

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.969 
you must break them in it's to me it's
not<00:01:29.850> that<00:01:30.000> big<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.299> deal<00:01:30.509> it<00:01:30.900> does<00:01:31.140> help<00:01:31.470> it's

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
not that big of a deal it does help it's

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.560 
not that big of a deal it does help it's
definitely<00:01:32.460> some<00:01:32.700> science<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:33.060> proves<00:01:33.270> that

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
definitely some science that proves that

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.420 
definitely some science that proves that
yes<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.110> does<00:01:34.320> help<00:01:34.590> it's<00:01:35.009> not<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.369> be

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
yes it does help it's not going to be

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.770 
yes it does help it's not going to be
revolutionary<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.360> not<00:01:36.479> going<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> sound

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
revolutionary it's not going to sound

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780 
revolutionary it's not going to sound
like<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.960> whole<00:01:37.229> world<00:01:37.500> just<00:01:37.740> change<00:01:38.159> but<00:01:38.670> it's

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
definitely gonna help the other thing

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.210 
definitely gonna help the other thing
that<00:01:40.409> a<00:01:40.439> lot<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.619> people<00:01:40.829> take<00:01:40.979> don't<00:01:41.159> take

headphones themselves and the pads molds
your<00:01:48.750> head<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.170> give<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> better<00:01:49.560> seal<00:01:50.009> and

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
your head to give you a better seal and

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.280 
your head to give you a better seal and
over<00:01:50.790> time<00:01:51.000> as<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> headphones<00:01:51.689> age<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:52.140> do

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
over time as the headphones age you do

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.050 
over time as the headphones age you do
get<00:01:52.530> better<00:01:52.680> sound<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:53.430> giving<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.850> time<00:01:54.000> to

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
get better sound so giving it time to

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.569 
get better sound so giving it time to
actually<00:01:54.600> wear<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.380> headphones<00:01:55.799> use<00:01:56.340> it

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579
