iphone so let's get these out of here
and<00:03:30.160> here<00:03:31.330> let's<00:03:32.330> see<00:03:32.570> yes<00:03:32.959> we<00:03:33.170> do<00:03:33.380> as<00:03:33.890> you<00:03:34.070> can

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
and here let's see yes we do as you can

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.820 
and here let's see yes we do as you can
see<00:03:34.400> there<00:03:34.580> we<00:03:34.670> get<00:03:34.820> squeegee<00:03:35.650> which<00:03:36.650> is

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
see there we get squeegee which is

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.430 
see there we get squeegee which is
pretty<00:03:37.040> thick<00:03:37.400> you<00:03:38.269> know<00:03:38.360> which<00:03:38.600> a<00:03:39.170> lot<00:03:39.410> of

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440

pretty thick you know which a lot of
thicker<00:03:39.739> than<00:03:39.860> normal<00:03:40.070> hence<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.239> reason<00:03:41.360> why

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
thicker than normal hence the reason why

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.340 
thicker than normal hence the reason why
you<00:03:41.690> buying<00:03:41.989> quality<00:03:42.230> and<00:03:44.140> there<00:03:45.140> we<00:03:45.320> have<00:03:46.209> the

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
you buying quality and there we have the

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.120 
you buying quality and there we have the

little microfiber it feels pretty smooth

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.310 
little microfiber it feels pretty smooth
