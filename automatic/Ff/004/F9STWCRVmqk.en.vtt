00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.780 

let's<00:03:16.200> wait<00:03:16.769> for<00:03:16.830> it<00:03:17.220> to<00:03:17.250> load<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:20.310> start<00:03:20.670> a

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.580 

okay<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.450> race<00:03:43.599> has<00:03:43.810> already<00:03:43.959> started

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.369 

I<00:03:47.680> don't<00:03:48.340> think<00:03:48.459> it's<00:03:49.269> a<00:03:49.360> best<00:03:49.569> of<00:03:49.720> experience

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:50.379 
I don't think it's a best of experience

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.009 
I don't think it's a best of experience
certainly<00:03:50.970> there<00:03:51.970> are<00:03:52.000> a<00:03:52.120> few<00:03:52.239> dropped<00:03:52.720> frames

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
certainly there are a few dropped frames

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:54.990 
certainly there are a few dropped frames
especially<00:03:53.590> while<00:03:53.769> going<00:03:54.489> around<00:03:54.819> the

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
especially while going around the

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.770 
especially while going around the
corners<00:03:55.420> I<00:03:56.430> don't<00:03:57.430> see<00:03:57.580> any<00:03:57.700> water<00:03:57.879> splashing

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780

the first time I want a regular player
of<00:04:35.860> this<00:04:36.010> game<00:04:36.600> seems<00:04:37.600> a<00:04:37.780> little<00:04:37.930> difficult<00:04:38.500> to

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
of this game seems a little difficult to

of this game seems a little difficult to
navigate<00:04:38.740> that<00:04:39.250> that<00:04:39.700> might<00:04:39.850> be<00:04:40.060> entirely<00:04:40.300> my

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:12.219 

I<00:05:09.940> think<00:05:10.940> I<00:05:11.030> think<00:05:11.210> I'll<00:05:11.300> give<00:05:11.509> a<00:05:11.539> pass<00:05:11.900> on<00:05:12.169> this
