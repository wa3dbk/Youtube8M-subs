00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.490
 the end of winter and the beginning of 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.530
 spring is the best time to 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.920
 fertilize the lawn to decide how 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:16.530
 fertilizing it must first be observed in 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.050
 in this case the lawn has reported 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.270
 relatively modest damage from the winter 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.640
 the carpet is particularly thick and not 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.950
 there are obvious yellowed areas e 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.830
 therefore advisable to use since 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.560
 immediately of slow-release fertilizers that 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.719
 allow to release the items in 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.610
 very gradually so approaching 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.829
 then to the summer season 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.480
 in this case instead we note that 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.519
 yellowing is more evident and 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.920
 probably in the most shady areas 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:46.050
 it will also have grown a lot of moss 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.039
 it will therefore be necessary to proceed with one 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.839
 river tooth fertilization that will allow 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.390
 also to remove the moss from the areas 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:56.940
 more shaded later will be 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.879
 however necessary to fertilize with gods 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.229
 concini to the intercession for 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.210
 get closer to the summer season than 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:05.250
 sustain the greatest period of growth 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.680
 at the end of the spring season 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.049
 so it will be necessary to think about 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.909
 summer fertilization this will allow the 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.310
 lawn to cope with high 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.960
 temperatures to water and stress 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.259
 reduce the damage that can be 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.380
 fertilizers from the summer 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.719
 distribute during this season yes 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.149
 they call antistress fertilizers are gods 

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.490
 slow release fertilizers that have a 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.390
 particularly potassium content 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.100
 high 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.469
 potassium is in fact capable of 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.299
 thickness the cell walls and reduce 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:38.490
 the passage of water from the inside 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.979
 of the cell towards the outside reducing 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.630
 in this way the water stress e 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.180
 increasing resistance at high 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.820
 temperature is essential to understand 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.159
 the importance of fertilizing for 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.920
 get a result like this one 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.109
 thick green lawn without yellowing e 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.630
 without diseases it is necessary that the 

00:01:55.109 --> 00:02:00.570
 fertilization follows a program during 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.420
 all year and that i 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.630
 appropriate fertilizers for each season also 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.160
 in those seasons in which it would seem 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.350
 inappropriate to fertilize like summer or 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.450
 winter before winter though 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.350
 we will have to think about the second phase of 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.270
 song growth 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.680
 we have the first phase of growth 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.850
 had in the spring with raising 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.130
 of temperatures 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.710
 the second phase will be presented in the autumn 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.120
 with lowering temperatures 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.060
 the increase in precipitation 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.490
 this is the time to fertilize with 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.500
 of slow release fertilizers of 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.720
 maintenance that they will be able to 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.330
 support the new growth phase of the 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.310
 lawn and then reach the beginning 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.080
 of the winter season to protect 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.060
 the lawn from the rigors of winter 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.130
 we will use a fertilizer with a high content of 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.720
 potassium that will allow us to prepare it 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.880
 at low temperatures 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.920
 I'm enrico found in the department 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.660
 agricultural gardening if you have 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:53.340
 need more advice on carpets 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.890
 grassy you can also write on 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.990
 facebook page of the farm ciao e 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.780
 fear of many think that fertilize 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:02.400
 during the summer it can cause damage 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.020
 actually using fertilizers a 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.570
 slow release this risk is a lot 

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:09.270
 limited and important however that the 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.420
 amount of fertilizer distributed both 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.160
 adequate this is a quantity that can 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.160
 be enough for one square meter
