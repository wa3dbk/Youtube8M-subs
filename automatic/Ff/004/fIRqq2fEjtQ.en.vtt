00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.780
 that is the Nokia c3 only one with a 5-megapixel camera and a 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.740
 Leda also has a 4x digital zoom 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.890
 Round just look at the camera function of the device once 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.650
 Hinschberger the device 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.810
 he will return to the main menu 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.890
 Sundern we have here seven percent trigger for the camera 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.099
 with what expressions then start the camera directly and I have synonymous push 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.660
 already taken a picture Summers merchant ships 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.780
 Setting options end should be on the part then we can 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.769
 zooming in here for example by giving back to the youth 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.990
 but we can do that as well, Leo will do it 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.080
 at negotiations 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.010
 and what they drew from it 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.230
 Also, as here can switch between photo and video mode 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.890
 the last chance to turn them on or off automatically 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.510
 and we can 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.810
 Here are the percent of our picture gallery you call it for a moment 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.310
 one way or the other a picture gallery 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:12.800
 under can and so by scrolling 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.200
 someone back 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.560
 and here we have the possibility to call up further options 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.920
 Photos View video camera setting that's self-timer photo he sees 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.459
 Effects White Balance Portrait I'm going back 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.780
 and have every opportunity to trigger and their team back button 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.180
 If I am so concerned about these travel options, the Nordire will move this 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.259
 delayed feedback again more a bit irritating the overdraft came 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:43.550
 a little too late 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.640
 but that does not mean I just say it 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.390
 Take a picture and I'll see that it works 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.390
 Home already pressed the photo is shot 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.040
 so here's a little bit focussed to focus more than that 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.040
 Pictures are pretty much out of focus 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.970
 if I have taken a test photo then I can delete the photo 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.309
 I can send it 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:15.459
 For this I have to turn the device by message at the elbow Landes Internet 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.669
 or send via Bluetooth 

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:22.609
 goes back here you can rotate the image when working crop effects 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.300
 Percent forms framework - Action Tax 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.439
 Hey contrast improve 

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:31.349
 because once I'm here chance you 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.349
 for example, such funny eyes 

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.689
 van Miert put on St 

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:39.999
 to save 

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.379
 Photo is saved 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.629
 So here is the camera is a 5-megapixel camera see the pictures here 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.010
 but not very special 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.200
 because you have to look like the then look at the PC, we have the first time 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.930
 Possibility to count 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.759
 the memorial 

00:02:57.759 --> 00:02:59.959
 becomes clear video camera 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.959
 they can here 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:06.809
 start the movie 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.519
 why from Sirte 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.519
