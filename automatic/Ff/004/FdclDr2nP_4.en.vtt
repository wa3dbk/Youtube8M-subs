 either to 120 and today I will show you and 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.110
 I'll tell you how to create and configure your 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.210
 server minecraft first thing you 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.120
 will need to go into any browser and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:18.029
 go to the site minekravt. no it 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.580
 the official website of minecraft and not 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.859
 supporter of some kind of left resource under 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.550
 Bajina yy a button click on a link 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.310
 talent turn and here and download here 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.669
 this is the file here is my multiplayer server 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.399
 Download this file here. 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.170
 Download save to any folder that 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:42.899
 want it to be downloaded to this one and 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.059
 open in the folder so that it is more convenient 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.890
 work with him best download 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.500
 some empty folder in which it will 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.500
 stored here as you can see it's empty 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.469
 folder and let it be kept 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:01:01.170
 next open the server turn on 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:05.630
 him and he should now generate the world 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.950
 Now the generation of the world will begin 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:13.979
 more precisely about the cargo to the area around 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.409
 Spawn now it progruz how we do 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.030
 it can be minimized 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.140
 Further you need to specifically principle 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.439
 editing the world open the file 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.610
 this server and here you are editing the world 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:31.229
 how do you want this date and modification 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.299
 so do not do it at all attributes 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.250
 server attributes it is not necessary 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.259
 edit 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.270
 so now i will show you what's there at all 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.490
 very important settings the first setting 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:46.290
 good it caught the name that is the name of the world 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:49.700
 here you can create any name at all 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:54.780
 absolutely for example the soil you to myworld 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:57.540
 for example no matter how there somehow 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:01.369
 you want to call your server next 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.520
 importantly this here it is not it is not necessary 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:08.340
 so now level is seed generation 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.800
 world earthly generation of the world is such 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.380
 the key with which the world is generated 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:17.070
 he either falls out accidentally or in 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.320
 you can create it yourself that is 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:23.670
 a specific key I link in the description 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:26.490
 with whom the next spawn ampisyd here always 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.180
 must be true because the spa 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.660
 Van Picea is the emergence of the villagers 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.400
 it is very important therefore it is not necessary to change 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.080
 The following is the spawn enimals ie 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.300
 the appearance of animals also put 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.160
 deliver a corpse if you want to not 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.040
 spawned 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.230
 hardcore hardcore is a game mode that is 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.750
 when you die more and more you are on this 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.590
 the server will not be able to log in unless of course you 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:55.230
 no exchange for example so well here I can 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.710
 texture pack is also not necessary here is an online mod 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.370
 online mod is the most important if you 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:02.880
 true 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.710
 mean people who have pirate to you not 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.810
 will be able to join in minecraft 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:13.820
 that is, it is desirable to set of course 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.820
 canvas this and put in principle you 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:20.540
 set falls next pvp pvp this 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.130
 battle between players 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.640
 better to leave the corpse of course so 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:29.880
 cost standard to be able to well 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.310
 whack other players next 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.140
 the difficulty Difficulty well this 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.760
 complexity 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.580
 to put the peace you need to put neither 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.860
 one a01 is light that is there then 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.990
 medium heavy 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:46.680
 Well, that is, from 0 to 2 you can set 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:50.280
 get infected next the game mod shit 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.800
 then for all players to be enabled 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.300
 creative or off creative 0 means 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:00.090
 off one on you need further 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.760
 here is the maximum number of players insert 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.640
 20 you then need in principle better 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.920
 No, of course it is better to put 12 because 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.620
 so that the server does not reboot if you have 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.950
 computer weak put better 12 on 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.480
 any case can be useful follow 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:17.880
 now peacock monsters ie appearance 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.440
 monsters and it is better to leave 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.870
 because without monsters to play 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.190
 uninteresting actuator is still important here 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.530
 distance reviews 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.810
 leave 10 because if more than 10 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.300
 will that can lag 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.820
 if less is not interesting to play here 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:35.630
 this inscription mod etc. 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:37.669
 This means that what is the inscription 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:44.350
 welcome you to meinkravt 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:50.900
 for example here you can write hello suddenly 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:55.580
 my server time as you want next 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:57.919
 save close as you see here 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.430
 many files appeared maybe he spoke 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:03.790
 and to give yourself the admin that will tell 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:06.560
 what nadya to open yourself admin area 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:10.810
 go to abs and write your nickname 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.810
 for example, I do not have a lipata encoder 123 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:21.380
 so keep closing again so 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:25.280
 further open another server here to 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:29.240
 give someone an admin 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.169
 player put on and on player's nickname 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:36.940
 in this case, even lepotas 123 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:39.710
 that's all what they titer all admin given 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:42.770
 if you want to give yourself or someone 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.510
 creative q then put this way or or 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:49.970
 take away from someone creative right now, show 

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:53.330
 write a game mod 0 if you want to take away 

00:05:49.970 --> 00:06:00.050
 creative q1 want to give creative q over 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:02.419
 dead give write your nickname or stranger 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:06.770
 the game as someone want to give the admin 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:08.479
 than anti then all is well and the player is not found but 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:13.910
 when this player logs in to him 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:17.050
 will be immediately on the creative to so is still not enough 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.010
 important function is how to close the server 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:20.570
 turn it off so you can just 

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:22.070
 click on the cross then the server 

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.320
 turns off very quickly and 

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:29.060
 wrong you seem to turn off 

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:31.940
 you need to write a stop command 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:35.090
 compress it all the services spun 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:38.360
 further so your friends can come to you 

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:43.730
 join you navigate the site 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:45.410
 two and a penny ru on this and here you are 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.300

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:51.040
 button just ip copied to the buffer 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:55.190
 exchange go to this folder 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:57.680
 turn on the text server again 

00:06:55.190 --> 00:06:59.540
 file and here in where ip server and 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.050
 enter this ip to get it 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:04.790
 do not constantly change again save 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:06.740
 include all your friends can to you 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:10.520
 constantly join that is not 

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:12.680
