how we play but there might be different
ways<00:02:22.660> of<00:02:23.050> playing<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:24.130> this<00:02:24.250> is<00:02:24.310> how<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:24.640> know

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
ways of playing so this is how you know

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:28.430 
ways of playing so this is how you know
like<00:02:25.170> Thomas<00:02:26.170> aside<00:02:26.530> completes<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.490> role

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
like Thomas aside completes the role

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.700 
like Thomas aside completes the role
let's<00:02:29.440> say<00:02:29.710> you<00:02:30.370> get<00:02:30.520> six<00:02:31.300> sweep<00:02:31.870> bring<00:02:32.440> one

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
let's say you get six sweep bring one

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.820 
let's say you get six sweep bring one
here<00:02:33.360> one<00:02:34.360> here<00:02:34.390> and<00:02:35.310> over<00:02:36.310> here<00:02:37.320> so<00:02:38.320> it<00:02:38.470> needs

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
here one here and over here so it needs

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.060 
here one here and over here so it needs
to<00:02:38.890> complete<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.340> whole<00:02:40.290> and<00:02:41.290> it<00:02:41.470> goes<00:02:41.710> all

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
to complete the whole and it goes all

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:45.480 
to complete the whole and it goes all
around<00:02:42.610> here<00:02:43.390> man<00:02:43.930> completes<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.740> it<00:02:45.220> comes

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490 
around here man completes and it comes

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.930 
around here man completes and it comes
here<00:02:45.790> so<00:02:46.750> this<00:02:46.930> is<00:02:47.080> how<00:02:47.200> you<00:02:47.260> play<00:02:47.820> look<00:02:48.820> at
