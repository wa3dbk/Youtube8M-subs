00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
about these tools is it's very balanced

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.520 
about these tools is it's very balanced
once<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.640> put<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> battery<00:01:45.270> pack<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.810> the

once you put the battery pack in the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.469 
once you put the battery pack in the
tool<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:46.890> almost<00:01:47.130> perfectly<00:01:47.579> balanced<00:01:48.119> at<00:01:48.270> the

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
tool is almost perfectly balanced at the

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.899 
tool is almost perfectly balanced at the
handle<00:01:48.840> because<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.350> motor<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.890> up<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:50.790> the

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
handle because the motor is up in the

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.389

cutting<00:01:51.210> head<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.560> really<00:01:52.799> balances

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
cutting head and that really balances

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.730 
cutting head and that really balances

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.350 
it's always come in handy so there you
have<00:04:32.199> it<00:04:32.380> the<00:04:32.800> unboxing<00:04:33.520> of<00:04:33.699> the<00:04:33.850> stuff<00:04:34.120> that

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
have it the unboxing of the stuff that

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.469 
have it the unboxing of the stuff that
Steele<00:04:34.740> provided<00:04:35.740> for<00:04:35.949> me<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.310> try<00:04:36.580> out<00:04:36.610> review

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
Steele provided for me to try out review

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.240 
Steele provided for me to try out review
I<00:04:37.720> think<00:04:38.470> it's<00:04:38.590> going<00:04:38.770> to<00:04:38.830> be<00:04:38.919> really

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
I think it's going to be really

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.650 
I think it's going to be really
interesting<00:04:39.760> to<00:04:39.880> see<00:04:40.060> how<00:04:40.210> these<00:04:40.360> tools

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
interesting to see how these tools

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.350 
interesting to see how these tools
perform<00:04:41.370> and<00:04:42.370> the<00:04:42.490> biggest<00:04:42.820> thing<00:04:43.000> I<00:04:43.090> want<00:04:43.240> to

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
perform and the biggest thing I want to

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.180 
perform and the biggest thing I want to
see<00:04:43.539> is<00:04:43.660> how<00:04:43.840> they<00:04:44.080> going<00:04:44.260> to<00:04:44.350> stand<00:04:44.620> up<00:04:44.919> to<00:04:45.070> the

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:45.190 
see is how they going to stand up to the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.400 
see is how they going to stand up to the
gas<00:04:45.370> powered<00:04:45.850> equipment<00:04:46.260> that'll<00:04:47.260> be<00:04:47.380> a

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
gas powered equipment that'll be a

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.920 
gas powered equipment that'll be a
really<00:04:47.710> good<00:04:48.010> test<00:04:48.389> almost<00:04:49.389> certainly

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930 
really good test almost certainly

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.900 
really good test almost certainly
believed<00:04:50.380> there's<00:04:50.650> some<00:04:50.860> true<00:04:51.070> potential<00:04:51.490> for

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
believed there's some true potential for

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:53.939 
believed there's some true potential for
battery<00:04:52.240> powered<00:04:52.660> tools<00:04:52.930> especially<00:04:53.350> like

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:53.949 
battery powered tools especially like

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.340 
battery powered tools especially like
these<00:04:54.220> not<00:04:55.000> only<00:04:55.060> now<00:04:55.510> but<00:04:55.720> in<00:04:55.870> the<00:04:55.960> future<00:04:56.199> as

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
these not only now but in the future as

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.680 
these not only now but in the future as
well<00:04:56.650> because<00:04:57.460> it's<00:04:57.639> battery<00:04:57.970> technology

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:58.690 
well because it's battery technology

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.659 
well because it's battery technology
gets<00:04:58.960> even<00:04:59.260> better<00:04:59.410> things<00:05:00.160> are<00:05:00.280> gonna<00:05:00.460> get

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
gets even better things are gonna get

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.000 
gets even better things are gonna get
lighter<00:05:00.970> and<00:05:01.270> more<00:05:01.570> efficient<00:05:02.080> well<00:05:02.860> that's

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 
lighter and more efficient well that's

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.730 
lighter and more efficient well that's
all<00:05:03.250> for<00:05:03.490> this<00:05:03.639> video<00:05:03.849> stay<00:05:04.780> tuned<00:05:05.200> because

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
all for this video stay tuned because

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.409 
all for this video stay tuned because
some<00:05:06.070> really<00:05:06.370> cool<00:05:06.550> videos<00:05:06.940> are<00:05:07.180> gonna<00:05:07.270> be

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
some really cool videos are gonna be

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:08.760 
some really cool videos are gonna be
coming<00:05:07.599> up<00:05:07.810> with<00:05:07.960> this<00:05:08.050> stuff

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:08.770 
coming up with this stuff

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:12.120 
coming up with this stuff
I<00:05:08.800> think<00:05:09.280> you<00:05:09.400> all<00:05:09.580> are<00:05:09.729> gonna<00:05:09.880> like
