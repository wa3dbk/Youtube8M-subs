 marinela the cookie with more spark 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.610
 sometimes we come across situations that 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.160
 they frighten us are moments that we 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.949
 make us doubt we will be able to achieve it 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.189
 we can get ahead because there is only 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.189
 a way to know the answer 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.189
 trying it 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.390
 that's why I have the magic and it's the touch 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.339
 Brazilian and that victory has 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.170
 taught not to lose like the 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:54.809
 defeat has taught me not to yield to 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.969
 anything can happen I learned it 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.000
 with the versatility of the legs of 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.100
 Pele is the coach that you never see you 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.769
 you see it and obviously you ask the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.119
 why do you call me brandon I am 20 years old 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.280
 study high school it's time to 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.350
 risk everything including the physical and 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.350
 I know I have practiced encouraged one year 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:24.080

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.970

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.190
 the little wolves and the keys even to 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.080
 sometimes practice with us because I 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.450
 I feel a little nervous because he has my 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.250
 first encounter and at the same time happy 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.110
 because I'm going to see everything that has 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.110
 learned to see if they have yielded results 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.579
 Well, we're already one day tonight 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.859
 we went to Prague the most important day of 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.039
 our lives together with all the kids 

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:51.780
 to talk because they are going to compete 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:53.729
 against the best 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.170
 some of them are their idols were 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.090
 the people that inspire me the practice 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.860
 of the sport and then have them in front 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.579
 in the battle it can be quite 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.829
 complicated 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.600
 it's not the same to see them at the bar 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.270
 so on the internet to see them already in 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.929
 person is not what one is afraid 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.929
 little bit to the best 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.819
 if I feel a little scared because it's the 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.530
 first time as environment 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.629
 even if you go to a stage 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.930
 freestyle or something you have fear or 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.840
 nerves 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.299
 it's the same the fight no longer is not like 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.299
 the masks and everything is something more serious 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.329
 obviously they are going to feel scared because 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:40.010
 expected is not any tournament I think that 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:42.950
 it's normal and they get quiet and 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.989
 know how to cope with fear not just the 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.209
 fear helps them to be better fears les 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.299
 helps motivate to give the best of 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.299
 your 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.340
 When something scares us, there's no need to 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.830
 close your eyes to the contrary you have to 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:04.010
 face our fears then 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.010
 Only then do we grow and we can be better 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.670
 dry fruits we share the emotion 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.819
 that the spark is at all times with 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.819
 cascarita and triqui traques marinela
