recognition all of a sudden while I

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.890 
recognition all of a sudden while I
gotta<00:02:14.100> look<00:02:14.280> back<00:02:14.460> trailer<00:02:14.850> so<00:02:15.450> I<00:02:15.480> look<00:02:15.720> back

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900

trailer<00:02:22.670> right<00:02:23.670> here<00:02:23.700> somewhere<00:02:24.480> I<00:02:24.750> probably

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
trailer right here somewhere I probably

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.300 
trailer right here somewhere I probably
could<00:02:25.440> have<00:02:25.470> done<00:02:25.650> a<00:02:25.680> little<00:02:25.800> better<00:02:26.010> if<00:02:26.220> I

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
could have done a little better if I

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.190 
could have done a little better if I
post<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.700> up<00:02:26.849> and<00:02:27.090> I<00:02:27.510> didn't<00:02:28.050> make<00:02:28.170> a

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
post it up and I didn't make a

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.229 
post it up and I didn't make a
commitment<00:02:28.620> but<00:02:29.310> it<00:02:29.519> still<00:02:29.760> worked<00:02:29.940> out<00:02:30.060> my

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
commitment but it still worked out my

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.160 
commitment but it still worked out my
benefit

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
benefit

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.800

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.350 
here is I should have just stayed in
trailer<00:02:40.920> but<00:02:41.400> instead<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.700> peeked<00:02:42.030> out<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.330> I

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
trailer but instead I peeked out and I

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.150 
trailer but instead I peeked out and I
didn't<00:02:42.630> see<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.840> guy<00:02:42.959> hop<00:02:43.170> out<00:02:43.349> middle<00:02:43.650> map<00:02:43.830> I

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
didn't see the guy hop out middle map I

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.860 
didn't see the guy hop out middle map I
ended<00:02:44.640> up<00:02:44.760> somehow<00:02:45.000> getting<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.480> kill<00:02:45.660> too

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
ended up somehow getting the kill too

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.740 
ended up somehow getting the kill too
just<00:02:46.110> because<00:02:46.140> he<00:02:46.410> wasn't<00:02:46.560> looking<00:02:46.770> at<00:02:47.040> me<00:02:47.190> and

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
just because he wasn't looking at me and

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.570 
just because he wasn't looking at me and
yeah<00:02:48.750> so<00:02:49.080> there's<00:02:49.680> two<00:02:49.890> dead<00:02:50.130> and<00:02:50.400> I'm<00:02:50.459> gonna

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
yeah so there's two dead and I'm gonna

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.920 
yeah so there's two dead and I'm gonna
push<00:02:50.790> towards<00:02:51.060> middle<00:02:51.209> head<00:02:51.450> glitch<00:02:51.660> but<00:02:51.870> I

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
push towards middle head glitch but I

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.270 
push towards middle head glitch but I
realized<00:02:52.319> that<00:02:52.500> one<00:02:52.620> of<00:02:52.650> my<00:02:52.770> teammates<00:02:53.100> is

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
realized that one of my teammates is

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.650 
realized that one of my teammates is
actually<00:02:53.550> doing<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.850> same<00:02:54.090> exact<00:02:54.450> thing

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
actually doing that same exact thing

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.510 
actually doing that same exact thing
here<00:02:54.930> in<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.050> second<00:02:55.440> you'll<00:02:56.100> notice<00:02:56.489> that

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
here in a second you'll notice that

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.850 
here in a second you'll notice that
sharp<00:02:57.030> slides<00:02:57.300> down<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.510> watch<00:02:57.750> middle<00:02:58.140> so<00:02:58.709> now

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
sharp slides down a watch middle so now

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.500 
sharp slides down a watch middle so now
I<00:02:58.890> need<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.400> better<00:02:59.550> job<00:02:59.700> of<00:02:59.910> realizing

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
I need to do a better job of realizing

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.150 
I need to do a better job of realizing
that<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.750> spawn<00:03:01.019> yet<00:03:01.290> again<00:03:01.560> should<00:03:01.830> be<00:03:01.980> back

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
that the spawn yet again should be back

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.650 
that the spawn yet again should be back
trailer<00:03:02.580> so<00:03:03.180> I'm<00:03:03.239> going<00:03:03.390> to<00:03:03.420> run<00:03:03.630> through

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
trailer so I'm going to run through

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.500 
trailer so I'm going to run through
bottom<00:03:04.110> would<00:03:04.319> um<00:03:04.940> run<00:03:05.940> through<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.180> window

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
bottom would um run through the window

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.759 
bottom would um run through the window
and<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.750> don't<00:03:06.900> think<00:03:07.050> feelers<00:03:07.319> need<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.560> spawn

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
and I don't think feelers need to spawn

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.479 
and I don't think feelers need to spawn
exactly<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:09.350> I'm<00:03:10.350> gonna<00:03:10.560> watch<00:03:10.739> trailer<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.430> I

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
exactly so I'm gonna watch trailer and I

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.440 
exactly so I'm gonna watch trailer and I
know<00:03:11.549> that<00:03:11.760> there's<00:03:11.880> probably<00:03:12.180> someone

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
know that there's probably someone

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.210 
know that there's probably someone
inside<00:03:12.840> of<00:03:12.900> the<00:03:13.080> bunker<00:03:13.410> so<00:03:13.769> I'm<00:03:13.860> gonna<00:03:13.950> easily

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
inside of the bunker so I'm gonna easily

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.039 
inside of the bunker so I'm gonna easily
go<00:03:14.519> look<00:03:14.700> towards<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.000> bunker<00:03:15.390> and<00:03:15.569> then

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
go look towards the bunker and then

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.420 
go look towards the bunker and then
immediately<00:03:16.290> look<00:03:16.709> towards<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:16.980> flag<00:03:17.220> that's

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
immediately look towards the flag that's

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.160 
immediately look towards the flag that's
being<00:03:17.580> taken<00:03:17.790> now<00:03:18.180> I'm<00:03:18.600> gonna<00:03:18.750> look<00:03:18.870> towards

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
being taken now I'm gonna look towards

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.630 
being taken now I'm gonna look towards
the<00:03:19.200> outlet<00:03:19.650> which<00:03:19.799> would<00:03:19.950> be<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.130> bottom<00:03:20.400> 10

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
the outlet which would be the bottom 10

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.910 
the outlet which would be the bottom 10
because<00:03:21.330> that's<00:03:21.660> going<00:03:21.810> to<00:03:21.900> be<00:03:22.019> easy<00:03:22.260> for

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
because that's going to be easy for

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.740 
because that's going to be easy for
someone<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.310> come<00:03:23.489> especially<00:03:23.760> whenever<00:03:24.510> they

expecting him to be there that close to

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:43.250 
expecting him to be there that close to
be<00:03:41.519> honest<00:03:41.880> um<00:03:42.060> I<00:03:42.299> need<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.540> trust<00:03:42.750> my<00:03:42.900> hip<00:03:43.049> fire

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
be honest um I need to trust my hip fire

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.280 
be honest um I need to trust my hip fire
a<00:03:43.320> lot<00:03:43.530> more<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.980> try<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.400> aim<00:03:45.299> down<00:03:45.480> sight<00:03:45.810> a<00:03:46.019> lot

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
a lot more I try to aim down sight a lot

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.229 
a lot more I try to aim down sight a lot
just<00:03:46.590> because<00:03:46.739> past<00:03:47.579> games<00:03:47.820> I<00:03:48.030> always

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
just because past games I always

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.550 
just because past games I always
struggle<00:03:48.540> with<00:03:48.570> hip<00:03:48.810> fire<00:03:49.019> and<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.320> thought<00:03:49.440> it

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
struggle with hip fire and I thought it

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.630 
struggle with hip fire and I thought it
was<00:03:49.620> better<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.070> a<00:03:50.130> them<00:03:50.310> all<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.489> time

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
was better just to a them all the time

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.270 
was better just to a them all the time
so<00:03:51.420> that's<00:03:52.380> something<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.769> definitely<00:03:53.040> need<00:03:53.220> to

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
so that's something I definitely need to

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.400 
so that's something I definitely need to
improve<00:03:53.549> on<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.910> being<00:03:54.450> like<00:03:54.630> pro<00:03:54.930> players<00:03:55.170> and

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
improve on it being like pro players and

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.340 
improve on it being like pro players and
stuff<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.859> I<00:03:56.400> don't<00:03:57.209> really<00:03:57.299> think<00:03:57.510> gun<00:03:58.019> skill

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
stuff it I don't really think gun skill

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.039 
stuff it I don't really think gun skill
is<00:03:58.590> necessarily<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.130> best<00:03:59.730> thing<00:04:00.090> um<00:04:00.329> that

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
is necessarily the best thing um that

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.120 
is necessarily the best thing um that
people<00:04:01.290> talking<00:04:01.500> about<00:04:01.620> i<00:04:01.650> think<00:04:01.859> that's<00:04:02.010> what

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
people talking about i think that's what

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.650 
people talking about i think that's what
separates<00:04:02.430> like<00:04:02.700> different<00:04:03.060> pros<00:04:03.239> from<00:04:03.420> being

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
separates like different pros from being

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.110 
separates like different pros from being
better<00:04:03.840> but<00:04:04.680> it's<00:04:04.920> also<00:04:05.130> awareness<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.000> just

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
better but it's also awareness and just

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.569 
better but it's also awareness and just
how<00:04:06.209> smart<00:04:06.540> you<00:04:06.690> are<00:04:06.870> map<00:04:07.620> control<00:04:08.070> and<00:04:08.430> stuff

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
the kill and getting killed I should at

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:42.290 
the kill and getting killed I should at
least<00:04:40.919> have<00:04:41.159> the<00:04:41.310> bottom<00:04:41.610> ten<00:04:41.849> guy<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.240> I

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
probably could have turned around Italy

back<00:06:43.320> the<00:06:44.320> three<00:06:44.590> cap<00:06:44.770> is<00:06:44.949> so<00:06:45.130> overrated<00:06:45.580> and

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:46.060 
back the three cap is so overrated and

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.529 
back the three cap is so overrated and
um<00:06:46.389> in<00:06:46.900> like<00:06:47.250> competitive<00:06:48.250> gameplay<00:06:48.460> I<00:06:48.880> think

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:49.539 
um in like competitive gameplay I think

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:50.879 
um in like competitive gameplay I think
it's<00:06:49.690> good<00:06:49.930> if<00:06:50.050> you<00:06:50.110> can<00:06:50.260> get<00:06:50.409> it<00:06:50.530> but<00:06:50.740> never

00:06:50.879 --> 00:06:50.889 
it's good if you can get it but never

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:53.430 
it's good if you can get it but never
fight<00:06:51.250> for<00:06:51.520> it<00:06:51.699> or<00:06:51.820> never<00:06:52.090> feel<00:06:52.990> like<00:06:53.139> you<00:06:53.260> have

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 
fight for it or never feel like you have

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.810 
fight for it or never feel like you have
to<00:06:53.469> get<00:06:53.770> it<00:06:53.860> just<00:06:54.010> because<00:06:54.130> you<00:06:54.430> play<00:06:54.610> both
