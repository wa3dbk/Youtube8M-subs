00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the very base so when you're holding it

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.519 
the very base so when you're holding it
you<00:00:17.820> just<00:00:18.060> you're<00:00:18.359> holding<00:00:18.840> like<00:00:18.869> a<00:00:19.140> really

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529

you just you're holding like a really
sharp<00:00:19.859> like<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> sharp<00:00:21.240> object<00:00:21.480> where<00:00:22.050> you're

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
sharp like a sharp object where you're

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.570 
sharp like a sharp object where you're
teasing<00:00:22.529> their<00:00:22.680> hair<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.250> since<00:00:23.490> you're

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
teasing their hair and it's since you're

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.790 
teasing their hair and it's since you're
being<00:00:23.699> really<00:00:23.970> aggressive<00:00:24.119> with<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.500> hurts

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
being really aggressive with it it hurts

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.080 
being really aggressive with it it hurts
my<00:00:25.949> fingers<00:00:26.010> and<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.519> makes<00:00:26.670> my<00:00:26.760> fingers

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
my fingers and it makes my fingers

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.230 
my fingers and it makes my fingers
really<00:00:27.570> read<00:00:27.750> after<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:29.279> couple<00:00:29.730> minutes<00:00:29.970> of

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
really read after a couple minutes of

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.930 
really read after a couple minutes of
teasing<00:00:30.599> their<00:00:30.750> hair<00:00:30.929> but<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.340> fact<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.669> it

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
teasing their hair but the fact that it

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.490 
teasing their hair but the fact that it
does<00:00:33.180> not<00:00:33.210> take<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:33.719> along<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.170> tease<00:00:34.380> your

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
does not take it along to tease your

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.380 
does not take it along to tease your
hair<00:00:34.559> and<00:00:34.980> says<00:00:35.280> it<00:00:35.430> takes<00:00:35.610> one<00:00:35.969> fourth<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.329> the

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
hair and says it takes one fourth of the

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.910 
hair and says it takes one fourth of the
time<00:00:36.690> I've<00:00:36.899> never<00:00:37.170> really<00:00:37.500> tied<00:00:37.739> myself

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
time I've never really tied myself

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.220 
time I've never really tied myself
teasing<00:00:38.700> someone's<00:00:39.180> hair<00:00:39.860> but<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:42.230> believe

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
teasing someone's hair but I believe

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.690 
teasing someone's hair but I believe
them<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.739> because<00:00:43.890> how<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.190> teeth<00:00:44.520> are

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
them just because how the teeth are

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.779 
them just because how the teeth are
shaped<00:00:45.530> so<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.860> would<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.190> had<00:00:47.309> a<00:00:47.340> little<00:00:47.579> bit

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
shaped so I would have had a little bit

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.540 
shaped so I would have had a little bit
about<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.719> teeth<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.469> second<00:00:49.950> if<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.430> can

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
about the teeth for a second if you can

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.310 
about the teeth for a second if you can
check<00:00:50.789> there's<00:00:51.059> like<00:00:51.239> four<00:00:51.600> rows<00:00:51.629> of<00:00:52.110> teeth

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
check there's like four rows of teeth

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.490 
check there's like four rows of teeth
going<00:00:52.829> straight<00:00:53.250> down<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.870> think<00:00:55.110> this<00:00:55.440> is

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
going straight down and I think this is

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.860 
going straight down and I think this is
what<00:00:55.770> helps<00:00:56.039> out<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> timing<00:00:57.420> how<00:00:57.840> long

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
what helps out just the timing how long

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.959 
what helps out just the timing how long
it<00:00:58.079> takes<00:00:58.469> because<00:00:58.949> you're<00:00:59.309> one<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.550> one

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
it takes because you're one in one

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.790 
it takes because you're one in one
stroke<00:01:00.239> your<00:01:00.480> calming<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.410> four<00:01:01.770> times

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
stroke your calming it like four times

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.039 
stroke your calming it like four times
back<00:01:02.699> and<00:01:02.730> forth<00:01:02.969> I'll<00:01:03.539> probably<00:01:03.780> put<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
back and forth I'll probably put a

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.550 
back and forth I'll probably put a
couple<00:01:04.290> clips<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:05.070> me<00:01:05.869> teasing<00:01:06.869> right<00:01:07.170> here<00:01:07.380> or

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
couple clips of me teasing right here or

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.020 
couple clips of me teasing right here or
maybe<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.979> end<00:01:08.130> I'm<00:01:08.310> not<00:01:08.490> really<00:01:08.640> sure<00:01:08.729> how

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
maybe the end I'm not really sure how

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.600 
maybe the end I'm not really sure how
I'm<00:01:09.090> going<00:01:09.240> to<00:01:09.299> play<00:01:09.479> this<00:01:09.630> out<00:01:09.810> as<00:01:10.340> of<00:01:11.340> well

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
I'm going to play this out as of well

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.480 
I'm going to play this out as of well
the<00:01:12.299> design<00:01:12.930> of<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.200> comb<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.770> really<00:01:14.070> nice<00:01:14.220> it

has these two little notches in either

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.620
