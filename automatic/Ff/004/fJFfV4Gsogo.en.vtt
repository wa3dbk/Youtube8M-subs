 help tve with us you will find 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.309
 solutions to the problems you can 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.980
 have your car appreciate your visit and 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.460
 we hope you also help us 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.360
 subscribing and giving like to our 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.970
 page 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.190
 remember help tve has helped thousands 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.320
 of people around the world and that we 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.449
 motivates to continue helping hello friends the 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.220
 Today I will be teaching you how to 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.160
 check the air conditioning system 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.979
 of your good car this is used from the 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.320
 simplest way that there can be truth 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:11.470
 we only learn here 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.040
 and start doing what they can tell 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.200
 then I have a list here ready 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.330
 little bottle of coolant opened it 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.650
 little bit so they can see what they are going to detect 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.650
 The escape 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.689
 as I labrin a little bit I let escape 

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:36.880
 a little coolant then what 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.880
 detects and realized that it detects 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:44.890
 the leak is being detected 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.890
 refrigerant this is very important for 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:53.290
 this is this gadget is very important 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.290
 to detect leaks in our car 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.530
 As I repeat, it is not very expensive. 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.689
 between 30 and 40 dollars this time it's 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.180
 the same thing that we are going to do with our 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.939
 first of all, we are going to 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.080
 check if you do not have any link or any 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:11.760
 escape forgiveness if you do not have a leak 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.790
 coolant by the lines what are we going 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.280
 to basically do is pass it on like this 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.440
 the whole system 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.860
 depending on the car you are set 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.819
 the lines but we're going to take it out like that 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:30.010
 and let's see if it detects any leak 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.120
 important when you do this method of 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.790
 detect any leak we will have the 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:40.959
 truck on with air conditioning 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:43.750
 put to see that the whole car is 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:47.100
 turned on then I'm going to start 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.100
 check if there is any link 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.150
 for every morning 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:02.370
 well I'm checking all the 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.940
 wholesalers should check all 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.940
 the daisies 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.760
 make the dressings of these 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:22.350
 these are important perhaps for 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.250
 make sure everything is working well 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:25.250
 this other 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.549
 and we will continue to see if it does not have 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.549
 some leak 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.900
 double check all ways all 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.420
 these refrigerant lines all the 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:58.380
 I have to perform well around to 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:01.380
 know if I do not have any leakage of 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.380
 refrigerant 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:07.590
 this is the easiest system of 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.590
 find antifreeze leaks 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.540
 as I repeat to you though the escape of these 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.270
 minutes and this coolant bottle 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.040
 it detects it and I opened it a little but 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:22.280
 as we can tell, I put him 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:27.930
 here to the leak detector lines 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:30.840
 a move they detect that there is a leak 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:33.210
 refrigerant in these lines then what 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.390
 What we are going to do is go to our store 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:39.449
 of auto parts and buy a little boat 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:42.029
 coolant that 

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:44.789
 which is already ready to seal leaks or 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:47.210
 either when they are putting brings you 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.310
 something that 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.930
 which is like a chemical that is going to seal 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:56.660
 any leak that the lines have 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.699
 then we're going to order coolant a 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:00.259
 refrigerant with sealant is the 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:03.319
 refrigerant with sealant we're going to 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:05.900
 put and that will seal us any 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:08.270
 leak that could have the lines here 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.330
 This is very simple and easy 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:14.090
 because if you take it to a place 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:17.000
 where they do air conditioning because they 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.250
 will be very expensive and especially if you 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.050
 they find leaks they will leave 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.050
 too expensive then 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:30.729
 they check if they have leaks and how they 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.230
 I repeat it is important to buy the detector 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:34.570
 leakage 

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:37.420
 the leak detector is very important 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.900
 buy it because with this we can 

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:43.420
 detect any leak in our 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:46.480
 car and this also helps us to 

00:05:43.420 --> 00:05:49.060
 detect leaking gasoline leaks after 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.540
 this good friends that has been all for 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:54.569
 today I hope you serve them this 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.199
 video 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:59.370
 I always invite you to watch the videos that 

00:05:58.199 --> 00:06:02.490

 have any suggestions or some 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:19.380
 comment let her know in the 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:22.470

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.440
 that can be true and if I allow it 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.120
 so let's continue uploading more videos 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:29.990
 until the next friends thanks for
