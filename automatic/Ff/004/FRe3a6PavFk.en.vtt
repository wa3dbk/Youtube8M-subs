GPS<00:04:25.080> with<00:04:25.230> reboot<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.800> then<00:04:26.250> take<00:04:26.490> about

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:26.700 
GPS with reboot and then take about

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.090 
GPS with reboot and then take about
three<00:04:27.060> minutes<00:04:27.090> for<00:04:27.390> to<00:04:27.750> re-track<00:04:28.530> itself<00:04:28.950> so

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
three minutes for to re-track itself so

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.460 
three minutes for to re-track itself so
by<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.310> time<00:04:29.550> it<00:04:29.700> would<00:04:29.820> reboot<00:04:30.360> again<00:04:30.480> so<00:04:31.290> we

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
by the time it would reboot again so we

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.260 
by the time it would reboot again so we
just<00:04:31.620> kind<00:04:31.860> of<00:04:31.919> had<00:04:32.340> to<00:04:32.370> unplug<00:04:32.669> it<00:04:32.910> and<00:04:33.060> just
