some<00:00:01.260> people<00:00:01.530> have<00:00:01.650> been<00:00:01.800> asking<00:00:01.949> how<00:00:02.490> to

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:02.899 
some people have been asking how to

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.619 
some people have been asking how to
reduce<00:00:03.899> the<00:00:04.170> size<00:00:04.470> of<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.859> slide<00:00:05.130> show<00:00:05.160> in<00:00:05.730> the

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
reduce the size of the slide show in the

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.240 
reduce the size of the slide show in the
tutorial<00:00:07.020> I'm<00:00:07.379> going<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.620> show<00:00:07.710> you<00:00:07.830> how<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.069> do

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
tutorial I'm going to show you how to do

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.440 
tutorial I'm going to show you how to do
that<00:00:10.370> first<00:00:11.370> we<00:00:11.670> need<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.849> download<00:00:12.150> this

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
that first we need to download this

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:44.750 
that first we need to download this
script

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.090 

there's<00:00:45.449> an<00:00:45.600> option<00:00:45.750> for<00:00:45.960> our<00:00:46.350> disabled<00:00:46.829> shade

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
there's an option for our disabled shade

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:57.020 
there's an option for our disabled shade
so<00:00:48.059> we<00:00:48.359> need<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.600> add<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.930> into<00:00:49.170> our<00:00:49.289> code<00:00:56.030> for

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
so we need to add this into our code for

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.850 
so we need to add this into our code for
step<00:00:57.210> 6<00:00:57.479> to<00:00:57.570> compile<00:00:58.159> run<00:00:59.159> this<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.739> that

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
step 6 to compile run this so that

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.160 
step 6 to compile run this so that
removes<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.430> shade<00:01:03.110> now<00:01:04.110> open<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.860> screw<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
removes the shade now open the screw and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.770 
removes the shade now open the screw and
go<00:01:07.170> to<00:01:07.229> line<00:01:07.560> 181<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.820> right<00:01:09.000> here<00:01:09.180> change

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
go to line 181 the right here change

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:16.550 
go to line 181 the right here change
this<00:01:10.080> to<00:01:10.460> 300<00:01:13.130> this<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.340> 300<00:01:15.170> so<00:01:16.170> that's<00:01:16.380> we

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
this to 300 this to 300 so that's we

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:24.330 
this to 300 this to 300 so that's we
will<00:01:16.680> change<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.100> size<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.640> this<00:01:17.759> slide<00:01:18.000> show

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.480 

now<00:01:24.880> go<00:01:25.179> to<00:01:25.210> line<00:01:25.539> 182<00:01:26.609> at<00:01:27.609> the<00:01:27.759> very<00:01:27.909> end

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
now go to line 182 at the very end

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:37.559 
now go to line 182 at the very end
changes<00:01:30.490> to<00:01:30.899> 300<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:33.569> this<00:01:34.569> is<00:01:35.310> 307<00:01:36.310> so<00:01:37.179> you<00:01:37.240> do

00:01:37.559 --> 00:01:37.569 
changes to 300 and this is 307 so you do

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.230 
changes to 300 and this is 307 so you do
that<00:01:37.780> then<00:01:38.200> you<00:01:38.229> will<00:01:38.979> not<00:01:39.159> close<00:01:39.429> a<00:01:39.490> slideshow

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
that then you will not close a slideshow

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.309 
that then you will not close a slideshow
if<00:01:40.539> you<00:01:40.659> click<00:01:40.929> outside<00:01:41.500> of<00:01:41.979> it<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:44.079> only

about when you zoom in and out so in
order<00:02:54.750> to<00:02:54.959> stop<00:02:55.290> that<00:02:55.700> go<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.760> nine<00:02:57.030> 256<00:02:57.870> and

order to stop that go to nine 256 and

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:06.710 
order to stop that go to nine 256 and
change<00:02:58.799> this<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.280> relative<00:03:05.120> also<00:03:06.120> on<00:03:06.390> the<00:03:06.480> same

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
change this to relative also on the same

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:15.700 
change this to relative also on the same
line<00:03:07.190> change<00:03:08.190> this<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.730> relative

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:28.260 

and<00:03:16.220> casually<00:03:16.670> fix<00:03:16.910> it

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:30.600 

I<00:03:28.330> don't<00:03:29.050> know<00:03:29.140> how<00:03:29.320> to<00:03:29.380> change<00:03:29.710> the<00:03:30.040> size<00:03:30.340> of

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
I don't know how to change the size of

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:35.070 
I don't know how to change the size of
through<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.820> bar<00:03:31.090> unfortunately<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:34.690> can<00:03:34.840> try

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
through a bar unfortunately you can try

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.360 
through a bar unfortunately you can try
to<00:03:35.140> change<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:36.850> value<00:03:37.300> of<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:38.530> variable<00:03:38.680> and

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
to change the value of this variable and

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
to change the value of this variable and
it's<00:03:39.520> variable<00:03:40.200> but<00:03:41.200> that<00:03:41.410> will<00:03:42.030> screw<00:03:43.030> up<00:03:43.060> the

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390 
it's variable but that will screw up the

00:03:43.390 --> 00:04:02.680 
it's variable but that will screw up the
image<00:03:43.720> map<00:03:44.050> function

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.980 

so<00:04:03.290> you<00:04:03.380> can<00:04:03.650> see<00:04:03.800> here<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.760> image<00:04:05.240> toolbar<00:04:05.720> is

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
so you can see here the image toolbar is

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.920 
so you can see here the image toolbar is
an<00:04:06.890> image<00:04:07.340> let's<00:04:08.000> seem<00:04:08.210> to<00:04:08.300> be<00:04:08.390> another<00:04:08.570> image

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
an image let's seem to be another image

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.520 
an image let's seem to be another image
below<00:04:09.140> that<00:04:09.410> 44<00:04:10.190> when<00:04:10.310> you<00:04:10.460> first<00:04:10.700> play<00:04:10.910> and

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
below that 44 when you first play and

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.940 
below that 44 when you first play and
another<00:04:12.530> image<00:04:12.920> as<00:04:13.130> a<00:04:13.190> background<00:04:13.520> and<00:04:14.950> that

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
another image as a background and that

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.800 
another image as a background and that
isn't<00:04:16.280> seem<00:04:16.400> to<00:04:16.519> be<00:04:16.640> variable<00:04:17.120> for<00:04:17.330> changing

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:17.810 
isn't seem to be variable for changing

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.350 
isn't seem to be variable for changing
the<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:19.310> size<00:04:19.610> of<00:04:19.880> the<00:04:20.000> background<00:04:20.209> image

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
the the size of the background image

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.460 
the the size of the background image
also<00:04:23.360> on<00:04:23.750> i03<00:04:24.260> at<00:04:25.040> the<00:04:25.190> beginning<00:04:25.870> you<00:04:26.870> can<00:04:27.110> set

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
also on i03 at the beginning you can set

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:32.380 
also on i03 at the beginning you can set
the<00:04:27.710> slide<00:04:28.130> duration<00:04:30.460> wise<00:04:31.460> changing<00:04:32.270> this

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:32.390 
the slide duration wise changing this

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.190 
the slide duration wise changing this
variable<00:04:32.960> this<00:04:33.890> is<00:04:33.950> the<00:04:34.190> milliseconds<00:04:34.910> so<00:04:35.200> you

variable this is the milliseconds so you
set<00:04:36.560> it<00:04:36.680> to<00:04:36.770> 1,000<00:04:37.400> so<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:37.640> will<00:04:37.820> be<00:04:37.940> one

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
set it to 1,000 so that will be one
