my hand but I don't have it because I

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.400 
my hand but I don't have it because I
didn't<00:01:12.270> cut<00:01:12.420> enough<00:01:12.920> I<00:01:14.060> did<00:01:15.060> do<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.690> I

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
didn't cut enough I did do it the I

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.170 
didn't cut enough I did do it the I
guessed<00:01:17.400> modern<00:01:18.270> way<00:01:18.510> of<00:01:18.930> actually

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
guessed modern way of actually

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.880 
guessed modern way of actually
extracting<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.480> the<00:01:22.020> pulp<00:01:22.260> and<00:01:22.500> stuff<00:01:22.710> from

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
extracting the the pulp and stuff from

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.870 
extracting the the pulp and stuff from
the<00:01:23.100> cactus<00:01:23.420> so<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.660> actually<00:01:25.520> they<00:01:26.520> were<00:01:26.580> nice

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
the cactus so on actually they were nice

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.000 
the cactus so on actually they were nice
enough<00:01:27.120> to<00:01:27.270> cut<00:01:27.660> all<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:28.020> pricklies<00:01:28.440> off<00:01:28.620> for

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
enough to cut all the pricklies off for

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.400 
enough to cut all the pricklies off for
me<00:01:29.160> so<00:01:29.760> I<00:01:29.790> didn't<00:01:30.210> have<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.690> that<00:01:30.840> process

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:31.410 
me so I didn't have to do that process

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.470 
me so I didn't have to do that process
so<00:01:31.560> all<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.860> prickles<00:01:32.250> prickly<00:01:33.030> pieces<00:01:33.360> were

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
so all the prickles prickly pieces were

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.810 
so all the prickles prickly pieces were
already<00:01:33.840> cut<00:01:34.110> off<00:01:34.260> for<00:01:34.530> me<00:01:34.680> all<00:01:35.430> I<00:01:35.460> had<00:01:35.550> to<00:01:35.730> do

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
already cut off for me all I had to do

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.420 
already cut off for me all I had to do
is<00:01:35.940> really<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.210> cut<00:01:36.600> it<00:01:36.720> up<00:01:36.870> and<00:01:37.800> I<00:01:37.890> used<00:01:38.100> water

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
is really I cut it up and I used water

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.590 
is really I cut it up and I used water
and<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.760> use<00:01:38.790> some<00:01:38.940> of<00:01:39.210> my<00:01:39.270> olive<00:01:39.780> plant<00:01:40.050> and<00:01:40.320> I

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
and I use some of my olive plant and I

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.350 
and I use some of my olive plant and I
put<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.900> nutribullet<00:01:43.620> and<00:01:44.240> blended<00:01:45.240> it

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
put it in a nutribullet and blended it

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.990 
put it in a nutribullet and blended it
up<00:01:45.480> after<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.260> was<00:01:46.410> blended<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.160> took<00:01:47.730> a<00:01:47.850> whole

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
up after it was blended I took a whole

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.220 
up after it was blended I took a whole
t-shirt<00:01:48.480> and<00:01:49.080> then<00:01:50.240> squeeze<00:01:51.240> all<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.480> juice

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
t-shirt and then squeeze all the juice

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:58.250 
t-shirt and then squeeze all the juice
and<00:01:52.830> the<00:01:53.010> I<00:01:54.110> guess<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.320> goo<00:01:56.130> out<00:01:57.140> of<00:01:58.140> the

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
and the I guess the goo out of the

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.710 
and the I guess the goo out of the
cactus<00:01:58.500> without<00:01:59.460> having<00:01:59.760> any<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.120> bits<00:02:00.420> of

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
cactus without having any the bits of

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.600 
cactus without having any the bits of
cactus<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.620> way<00:02:01.740> I<00:02:01.770> don't<00:02:01.860> get<00:02:02.100> any<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.490> my

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
cactus so that way I don't get any in my

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.890 
cactus so that way I don't get any in my
hair<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:04.040> I'm<00:02:05.040> not<00:02:05.370> I'm<00:02:05.910> not<00:02:05.970> using<00:02:06.480> any<00:02:06.600> soap

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
would do different is the way that I

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.900 
would do different is the way that I
strained<00:04:14.750> the<00:04:14.870> cactus<00:04:15.470> I<00:04:15.650> used<00:04:16.579> a<00:04:16.700> wife-beater

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
strained the cactus I used a wife-beater

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.170 
strained the cactus I used a wife-beater
instead<00:04:17.720> of<00:04:17.810> a<00:04:17.989> t-shirt<00:04:18.769> so<00:04:19.160> I<00:04:19.430> think<00:04:19.880> some<00:04:20.090> of

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:20.180 
instead of a t-shirt so I think some of

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.640 
instead of a t-shirt so I think some of
the<00:04:20.239> bits<00:04:20.419> of<00:04:20.600> cactus<00:04:20.959> kind<00:04:21.229> of<00:04:21.320> seeped

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:21.650 
the bits of cactus kind of seeped

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:24.190 
the bits of cactus kind of seeped
through<00:04:21.769> the<00:04:22.660> wife-beater<00:04:23.660> because<00:04:23.990> you<00:04:24.080> know

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
through the wife-beater because you know

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.320 
through the wife-beater because you know
it<00:04:24.290> is<00:04:24.410> you<00:04:24.919> know<00:04:25.040> pretty<00:04:25.310> pretty<00:04:26.120> thin

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
it is you know pretty pretty thin

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.690 
it is you know pretty pretty thin
material<00:04:26.840> so<00:04:27.440> I<00:04:27.470> think<00:04:27.590> next<00:04:27.770> time<00:04:28.040> I<00:04:28.220> will<00:04:28.370> use

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
material so I think next time I will use

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.310 
material so I think next time I will use
a<00:04:29.740> different<00:04:31.450> just<00:04:32.450> gonna<00:04:32.600> be<00:04:32.690> a<00:04:32.750> cotton<00:04:33.110> shirt

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320

a different just gonna be a cotton shirt
cotton<00:04:33.950> t-shirt<00:04:34.310> instead<00:04:37.870> but<00:04:38.870> yeah<00:04:39.229> this<00:04:39.500> is

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
cotton t-shirt instead but yeah this is

cotton t-shirt instead but yeah this is
my<00:04:41.539> hair<00:04:44.860> thinking<00:04:45.860> about<00:04:46.010> trying<00:04:46.250> to<00:04:46.340> let

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
my hair thinking about trying to let

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.969 
my hair thinking about trying to let
some<00:04:46.700> of<00:04:46.820> them<00:04:46.990> combine<00:04:47.990> a<00:04:48.320> little<00:04:48.560> bit<00:04:48.770> more

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:48.979 
some of them combine a little bit more

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:51.159 
some of them combine a little bit more
because<00:04:49.880> I<00:04:49.910> do<00:04:50.060> want<00:04:50.389> them<00:04:50.510> a<00:04:50.720> little<00:04:51.050> bit

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
because I do want them a little bit

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:54.730 
because I do want them a little bit
thicker<00:04:51.380> so<00:04:52.039> I'm<00:04:52.970> not<00:04:53.150> gonna<00:04:53.360> train<00:04:54.139> them<00:04:54.350> as

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
thicker so I'm not gonna train them as

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.900 
thicker so I'm not gonna train them as
much<00:04:56.289> you<00:04:57.289> know<00:04:57.320> separate<00:04:57.919> them<00:04:58.070> as<00:04:58.280> much<00:04:58.550> just

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
much you know separate them as much just

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.890 
much you know separate them as much just
let<00:04:59.090> them<00:05:00.310> get<00:05:01.310> together<00:05:01.520> do<00:05:02.419> what<00:05:02.539> they<00:05:02.660> want

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:02.900 
let them get together do what they want

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:30.310 
let them get together do what they want
to<00:05:02.990> do<00:05:03.580> but<00:05:08.380> my<00:05:09.380> hair

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.490 

you<00:05:31.320> see<00:05:31.560> how<00:05:31.650> some<00:05:31.830> of<00:05:31.950> them<00:05:32.100> are<00:05:32.220> combined

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
you see how some of them are combined

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.010 
you see how some of them are combined
already<00:05:38.150> that<00:05:39.150> one<00:05:39.300> has<00:05:39.510> two

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020 
already that one has two

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:42.800 
already that one has two
so<00:05:40.110> this<00:05:40.260> is<00:05:40.440> a<00:05:40.470> pretty<00:05:41.090> that<00:05:42.090> is<00:05:42.390> gonna<00:05:42.630> be<00:05:42.780> a

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:42.810 
so this is a pretty that is gonna be a

00:05:42.810 --> 00:06:04.230 
so this is a pretty that is gonna be a
thick<00:05:43.080> walk<00:05:43.430> once<00:05:44.430> it<00:05:44.580> grows<00:05:44.820> more
