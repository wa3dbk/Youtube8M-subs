00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
every day since to be since we started

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.630 
every day since to be since we started
basically<00:00:48.220> from<00:00:48.760> October<00:00:49.300> 10th<00:00:49.920> so<00:00:50.920> now<00:00:51.160> it's

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
basically from October 10th so now it's

lonely reads it every single day well we
live<00:00:56.379> on<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.650> base<00:00:56.830> so<00:00:57.160> you<00:00:57.910> get<00:00:58.920> everything

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
live on the base so you get everything

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.740 
live on the base so you get everything
you<00:01:00.129> could<00:01:00.280> possibly<00:01:00.640> imagine<00:01:00.730> here<00:01:01.360> we<00:01:01.600> get

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:01.750 
you could possibly imagine here we get

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.189 
you could possibly imagine here we get
freezing<00:01:02.110> fog<00:01:03.480> bringing<00:01:04.480> everything<00:01:04.720> else<00:01:04.989> so

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
freezing fog bringing everything else so

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.810 
freezing fog bringing everything else so
