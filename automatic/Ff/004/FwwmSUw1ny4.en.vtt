00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:18.590
 [Music] 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.339
 dear friends of the 

00:00:22.249 --> 00:00:27.259
 fantastic a small mini sequence 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.410
 which was not planned but 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.090
 which I make today to the 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.480
 big and small mysteries of this world 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.750
 and above all things to taxed ufo 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.640
 topics so I read every day 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.030
 News news and statements and 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.159
 Discussions on mystery 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.140
 astronautics and co there you have to 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:52.159
 some really in the ground and bottom 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:54.890
 ashamed that one also with the topic 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:56.299
 ufos and the topic extraterrestrial 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.040
 that's why it does not necessarily have 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:59.570
 to do something with each other it is not 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.970
 proved that uhu's extraterrestrial 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.129
 but spaceships are however that may be 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.590
 I have two press releases here 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:08.119
 let's get on my desk 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.990
 are some days old and there I get 

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:11.420
 the puke 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.430
 An author claims the name 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.259
 I'm not or the author 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.380
 This press release is there on 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.509
 an author profession a sensational 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.939
 wrote in which he occupies 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.729
 how UFO technologies work 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:27.950
 and this is about it being that 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:30.350
 airplane what is currently busy looking for 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.680
 is the flight of the malaysia airlines 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:37.340
 I have to read here emh 370 her 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:39.200
 know that crashed in southeast Asia 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.090
 is for which there is no trace and is 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.600
 probably a few hundred dead 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.700
 gave in any case claimed here 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.600
 this press release and the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.869
 second press release also that this 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:56.390
 this airbus that jumbojet that 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.650
 this one collided with an ufo 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:04.520
 of course that's a very, very, very 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:07.189
 strong indication that is so to the 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.349
 catastrophe has come supposedly 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.439
 for example, a bomb explosion 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.599
 board the crew still given time 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:17.870
 to make an emergency call and such 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.849
 nonsense more and therefore claim 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.340
 these messages are the vocation 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:25.459
 this for me absolutely dubious 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.950
 By now this is only by cars 

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.370
 it can be crashed with one 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.840
 super great ufo collided is because that 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.670
 is the only reason why one 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.670
 machine could be shattered in the air 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.709
 and should have disappeared without a trace 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.200
 So I have to say there is off 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.810
 and that's what it's like to be 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.480
 a lot left it every day so it 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.180
 embarrassing is that you are also with the 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.849
 here becomes one 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:56.299
 human disaster misused 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:59.299
 raped for a scrap book 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:02.480
 to draw an author's attention to the 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.819
 press release based on this one 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.680
 catastrophe spread a bit further 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:10.239
 So I have to say that we are there 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.519
 keep up with such a nonsense 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.690
 Dear people, you can talk a lot about us 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.450
 read and report 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.790
 but you do not have any theme 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.010
 somehow with supposedly flying 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.329
 communicate saucers and 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.530
 not even this one right now 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:29.209
 disaster with the plane crash in 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.250
 Southeast Asia so if the members 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.329
 who still desperately hope and 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:37.370
 fear and pray if such 

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:40.280
 absurd press releases hear reading 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:42.650
 So I think they would still be 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.200
 more finished than they already are 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.299
 so as I said I mention this 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.920
 This dubious book is author and 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.500
 this stupid press release 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.910
 At first we do not hope that 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.769
 maybe somehow 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:57.859
 survivor or more survivor 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:00.049
 which are found by what what 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.170
 I always know the plane crash 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.760
 survived that somehow happened 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:09.019
 but certainly not because he is with one 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.359
 great living space powered by over 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.780
 colliding with the sea is therefore more complete 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.639
 nonsense 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.639
 until the next following bowl seven
