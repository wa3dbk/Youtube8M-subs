00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.760 

the<00:00:19.789> four<00:00:19.970> of<00:00:20.000> us<00:00:20.240> were<00:00:20.420> actually<00:00:20.900> very

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
the four of us were actually very

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:24.460 
the four of us were actually very
interested<00:00:22.369> in<00:00:23.080> specifically<00:00:24.080> the<00:00:24.230> kind<00:00:24.410> of

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
interested in specifically the kind of

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.170 
interested in specifically the kind of
digital<00:00:24.650> production<00:00:25.279> aspect<00:00:25.580> and<00:00:25.849> we<00:00:25.970> really

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
digital production aspect and we really

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.510 
digital production aspect and we really
wanted<00:00:26.420> to<00:00:26.480> also<00:00:26.660> build<00:00:26.869> something<00:00:27.259> big<00:00:27.439> so<00:00:28.160> we

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:28.520 
wanted to also build something big so we

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.190 
wanted to also build something big so we
decided<00:00:29.150> that<00:00:29.240> this<00:00:29.450> whole<00:00:29.750> Shanghai

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 
decided that this whole Shanghai

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.589 
decided that this whole Shanghai
opportunity<00:00:31.009> was<00:00:31.220> a<00:00:31.250> was<00:00:31.970> a<00:00:32.000> great<00:00:32.239> way<00:00:32.540> to

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
opportunity was a was a great way to

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:42.790 
opportunity was a was a great way to
kind<00:00:33.230> of<00:00:33.379> finish<00:00:34.040> our<00:00:34.309> year

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.889 

I<00:00:44.320> definitely<00:00:45.320> think<00:00:45.829> that<00:00:45.980> there's<00:00:46.690> in<00:00:47.690> a<00:00:47.780> way

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:47.899 
I definitely think that there's in a way

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.299 
I definitely think that there's in a way
a<00:00:47.930> kind<00:00:48.170> of<00:00:48.260> return<00:00:48.770> to<00:00:50.440> making<00:00:51.440> with<00:00:52.160> an

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
a kind of return to making with an

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.770 
a kind of return to making with an
architecture<00:00:52.879> that<00:00:52.910> there<00:00:53.180> is<00:00:53.329> a<00:00:53.360> kind<00:00:53.629> of

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
architecture that there is a kind of

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.060 
architecture that there is a kind of
closeness<00:00:54.620> now<00:00:55.220> between<00:00:56.140> production<00:00:57.140> and<00:00:57.379> the

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:58.070 
closeness now between production and the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.520 
closeness now between production and the
kind<00:00:58.280> of<00:00:58.340> fabrication<00:00:59.260> industries<00:01:00.260> as<00:01:00.470> well

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
kind of fabrication industries as well

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.850 
kind of fabrication industries as well
as<00:01:02.199> architects<00:01:03.199> that<00:01:03.290> are<00:01:03.379> working<00:01:03.559> in<00:01:03.769> an

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
as architects that are working in an

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.320 
as architects that are working in an
office<00:01:03.980> it's<00:01:04.339> no<00:01:04.460> longer<00:01:04.729> a<00:01:04.909> kind<00:01:05.269> of

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
office it's no longer a kind of

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.930 
office it's no longer a kind of
separated<00:01:06.050> process<00:01:06.710> but<00:01:06.950> really<00:01:07.220> something

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
separated process but really something

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.580 
separated process but really something
that<00:01:08.060> that's<00:01:08.390> much<00:01:08.750> closely<00:01:09.259> combined

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
that that's much closely combined

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.020 
that that's much closely combined
because<00:01:09.860> now<00:01:10.009> that<00:01:10.250> we<00:01:10.340> have<00:01:10.369> these<00:01:10.700> kinds<00:01:11.000> of

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:11.030 
because now that we have these kinds of

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.520 
because now that we have these kinds of
technologies<00:01:11.630> we<00:01:11.869> also<00:01:11.990> have<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.350> knowledge

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
technologies we also have the knowledge

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.350 
technologies we also have the knowledge
of<00:01:12.920> talking<00:01:13.670> to<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:13.880> people<00:01:14.210> that<00:01:14.330> are

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
of talking to the people that are

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.910 
of talking to the people that are
working<00:01:14.720> in<00:01:14.840> these<00:01:14.960> factories<00:01:15.140> that<00:01:15.649> are

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
working in these factories that are

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.070 
working in these factories that are
producing<00:01:16.460> things<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:17.000> obviously<00:01:17.509> right<00:01:17.930> now

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
producing things and obviously right now

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.450 
producing things and obviously right now
we're<00:01:18.289> making<00:01:18.590> a<00:01:18.649> prototype<00:01:19.130> out<00:01:19.310> of

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
we're making a prototype out of

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.300 
we're making a prototype out of
cardboard<00:01:20.229> which<00:01:21.229> may<00:01:21.440> not<00:01:21.649> be<00:01:21.800> used<00:01:21.979> in

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
cardboard which may not be used in

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.430 
cardboard which may not be used in
everyday<00:01:22.640> architecture<00:01:23.330> but<00:01:23.869> you<00:01:24.020> can<00:01:24.140> apply

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:24.440 
everyday architecture but you can apply

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.050 
everyday architecture but you can apply
the<00:01:24.500> same<00:01:24.860> techniques<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:25.820> the<00:01:25.880> same

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
the same techniques and the same

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.290 
the same techniques and the same
knowledge<00:01:26.240> also<00:01:26.720> to<00:01:26.929> thinking<00:01:27.470> about<00:01:27.649> how

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
knowledge also to thinking about how

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.639 
knowledge also to thinking about how
facade<00:01:29.300> systems<00:01:29.780> might<00:01:29.990> be<00:01:30.110> produced<00:01:30.440> how

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
facade systems might be produced how

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.080 
facade systems might be produced how
windows<00:01:31.039> might<00:01:31.220> be<00:01:31.340> produced<00:01:31.640> all<00:01:31.850> of<00:01:31.970> these

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
windows might be produced all of these

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.029 
windows might be produced all of these
things<00:01:32.240> that<00:01:32.390> are<00:01:32.600> usually<00:01:33.500> in<00:01:33.649> a<00:01:33.770> kind<00:01:33.950> of

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
things that are usually in a kind of

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:36.279 
things that are usually in a kind of
factory<00:01:34.820> production<00:01:35.060> process<00:01:35.690> is<00:01:35.929> something

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:36.289 
factory production process is something

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.340 
factory production process is something
that<00:01:36.380> we<00:01:36.560> as<00:01:36.740> architects<00:01:37.280> can<00:01:37.970> now<00:01:38.179> effect<00:01:38.690> in

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.350 
that we as architects can now effect in

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.330 
that we as architects can now effect in
terms<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:40.039> the<00:01:40.190> actual<00:01:40.310> production<00:01:45.340> basically

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
terms of the actual production basically

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.449 
terms of the actual production basically
these<00:01:46.490> are<00:01:46.550> the<00:01:46.819> codes<00:01:47.720> that<00:01:47.959> are<00:01:48.020> ready<00:01:48.459> for

00:01:49.449 --> 00:01:49.459 
these are the codes that are ready for

00:01:49.459 --> 00:01:51.130 
these are the codes that are ready for
transform<00:01:50.000> and<00:01:50.209> essentially<00:01:50.660> we<00:01:50.780> just<00:01:50.989> need

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.140 
transform and essentially we just need

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.190 
transform and essentially we just need
to<00:01:51.229> pack<00:01:51.410> this<00:01:51.649> create<00:01:52.280> it<00:01:52.429> and<00:01:52.700> then<00:01:53.239> bring<00:01:54.110> it

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
to pack this create it and then bring it

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:03.130 
to pack this create it and then bring it
on<00:01:54.289> the<00:01:54.380> plane

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.990 

our<00:02:03.200> design<00:02:03.740> concepts<00:02:04.430> and<00:02:04.700> we<00:02:04.820> have<00:02:04.970> a

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
our design concepts and we have a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.030 
our design concepts and we have a
structure<00:02:05.540> that<00:02:05.570> is<00:02:05.810> built<00:02:06.050> out<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.200> cones<00:02:06.650> we

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
structure that is built out of cones we

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.040 
structure that is built out of cones we
choose<00:02:07.280> cones<00:02:07.610> for<00:02:07.970> for<00:02:08.390> different<00:02:08.660> reasons

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
choose cones for for different reasons

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.140 
choose cones for for different reasons
because<00:02:09.200> they<00:02:09.500> can<00:02:09.740> be<00:02:10.490> nested<00:02:10.729> in<00:02:11.060> the

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
because they can be nested in the

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.850 
because they can be nested in the
production<00:02:11.510> process<00:02:11.810> and<00:02:12.319> those<00:02:12.440> in<00:02:12.680> an

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
production process and those in an

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.420 
production process and those in an
transport<00:02:13.670> process<00:02:14.060> we<00:02:14.810> try<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:16.130> have<00:02:16.310> the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
transport process we try to to have the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.910 
transport process we try to to have the
bottom-up<00:02:16.880> approach<00:02:17.440> where<00:02:18.440> all<00:02:18.709> the

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
bottom-up approach where all the

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.030 
bottom-up approach where all the
elements<00:02:19.220> are<00:02:19.610> all<00:02:19.820> different<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.420> they<00:02:20.600> all

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
elements are all different and they all

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.680 
elements are all different and they all
negotiate<00:02:22.040> and<00:02:22.430> their<00:02:22.640> space<00:02:22.970> to<00:02:23.209> get<00:02:23.360> on<00:02:23.570> a

position we never design all this thing

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.420 
position we never design all this thing
by<00:02:27.110> hand<00:02:27.380> but<00:02:28.370> it's<00:02:28.520> all<00:02:28.760> it's<00:02:29.090> all<00:02:29.330> programmed

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
by hand but it's all it's all programmed

by hand but it's all it's all programmed
in<00:02:31.430> a<00:02:31.670> script<00:02:32.080> and<00:02:33.080> we<00:02:33.709> program<00:02:34.190> in<00:02:34.310> a

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
programming language and we give some

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.800 
programming language and we give some
rules<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.489> some<00:02:37.820> kind<00:02:38.000> of<00:02:38.060> freedoms<00:02:38.480> to<00:02:38.570> these

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
rules and some kind of freedoms to these

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.009 
rules and some kind of freedoms to these
rules<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:39.489> some<00:02:40.489> geometric<00:02:41.120> concept<00:02:41.870> and

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
rules and some geometric concept and

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:43.840 
rules and some geometric concept and
then<00:02:42.140> we<00:02:42.290> let<00:02:42.470> the<00:02:42.590> program<00:02:42.980> run<00:02:43.220> and<00:02:43.519> then<00:02:43.730> we

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
then we let the program run and then we

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.699 
then we let the program run and then we
see<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.090> results<00:02:44.720> that<00:02:44.840> we<00:02:44.989> can<00:02:45.260> change<00:02:45.500> the

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
see the results that we can change the

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.699 
see the results that we can change the
program<00:02:46.040> again<00:02:46.160> and<00:02:46.519> so<00:02:46.670> on<00:02:46.820> and<00:02:47.320> and<00:02:48.320> this<00:02:48.530> is

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
program again and so on and and this is

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.560 
program again and so on and and this is
a<00:02:48.739> little<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.340> different<00:02:49.730> kind<00:02:49.940> of<00:02:50.030> approach

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:50.570 
a little a different kind of approach

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.620 
a little a different kind of approach
for<00:02:51.380> the<00:02:51.440> design<00:02:51.769> process<00:02:51.980> as<00:02:52.850> traditional

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:53.630 
for the design process as traditional

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:57.430 
for the design process as traditional
hand<00:02:53.900> handmade<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.860> design<00:02:55.730> process<00:02:56.440> you

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
hand handmade and design process you

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.690 
hand handmade and design process you
know<00:02:57.530> quite<00:02:57.680> some<00:02:57.860> years<00:02:57.890> ago<00:02:58.130> you<00:02:58.370> have<00:02:58.580> the

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
know quite some years ago you have the

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.460 
know quite some years ago you have the
kind<00:02:58.850> of<00:02:58.910> master<00:02:59.150> builder<00:02:59.660> where<00:02:59.870> the<00:03:00.110> the

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:00.470 
kind of master builder where the the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.199 
kind of master builder where the the
architect<00:03:00.980> designed<00:03:01.400> something<00:03:01.670> then<00:03:01.940> hands

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
architect designed something then hands

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:03.820 
architect designed something then hands
it<00:03:02.269> over<00:03:02.420> and<00:03:02.690> then<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.900> people<00:03:03.050> just

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
it over and then the people just

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.729 
it over and then the people just
constructed<00:03:04.760> and<00:03:04.970> now<00:03:05.750> it's<00:03:06.110> it's<00:03:06.320> actually

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
constructed and now it's it's actually

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.470 
constructed and now it's it's actually
the<00:03:07.280> whole<00:03:07.610> process<00:03:07.850> is<00:03:08.180> much<00:03:08.299> more

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
the whole process is much more

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.060 
the whole process is much more
collaborative<00:03:08.810> there's<00:03:09.320> not<00:03:09.829> such<00:03:10.040> a

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:10.070 
collaborative there's not such a

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:12.729 
collaborative there's not such a
hierarchy<00:03:10.670> maybe<00:03:10.940> but<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:12.049> idea<00:03:12.560> of<00:03:12.650> the

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
hierarchy maybe but the the idea of the

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.280 
hierarchy maybe but the the idea of the
architect<00:03:13.250> is<00:03:13.400> then<00:03:13.610> somebody<00:03:14.510> who's<00:03:14.720> more<00:03:17.290> I

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
architect is then somebody who's more I

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.390 
architect is then somebody who's more I
guess<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:19.489> a<00:03:19.730> coordinator<00:03:21.160> maybe<00:03:22.160> somebody

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:22.400 
guess a a coordinator maybe somebody

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.890 
guess a a coordinator maybe somebody
that's<00:03:22.730> more<00:03:22.880> like<00:03:23.030> a<00:03:23.060> conductor<00:03:23.600> of<00:03:23.630> an

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
that's more like a conductor of an

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.470 
that's more like a conductor of an
orchestra<00:03:24.100> that<00:03:25.100> brings<00:03:25.760> together<00:03:26.000> all<00:03:26.269> of

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
orchestra that brings together all of

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.600 
orchestra that brings together all of
these<00:03:26.750> experts<00:03:27.290> and<00:03:27.560> tries<00:03:28.070> to<00:03:28.100> get<00:03:28.430> then

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
these experts and tries to get then

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.630 
these experts and tries to get then
these<00:03:28.730> complex<00:03:29.360> projects<00:03:29.959> through<00:03:30.400> and<00:03:31.400> I

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
these complex projects through and I

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.819 
these complex projects through and I
think<00:03:31.850> that<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:32.450> sense<00:03:32.780> it's<00:03:33.260> not<00:03:33.560> just

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
think that in that sense it's not just

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.819 
think that in that sense it's not just
about<00:03:33.950> being<00:03:34.220> a<00:03:34.579> designer<00:03:35.150> that<00:03:35.690> has<00:03:36.410> an<00:03:36.709> eye

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:36.829 
about being a designer that has an eye

00:03:36.829 --> 00:03:39.390 
about being a designer that has an eye
but<00:03:37.070> it's<00:03:37.190> also<00:03:37.340> being<00:03:37.579> an<00:03:37.820> editor<00:03:38.030> it's<00:03:38.480> being

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
but it's also being an editor it's being

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.860 
but it's also being an editor it's being
somebody<00:03:40.400> that<00:03:40.459> that's<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:41.000> consultant

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
somebody that that's a consultant

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.190 
somebody that that's a consultant
somebody<00:03:42.260> that's<00:03:42.500> actually<00:03:43.030> also<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:45.110> know

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
somebody that's actually also you know

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.050 
somebody that's actually also you know
able<00:03:45.530> to<00:03:45.709> comment<00:03:46.220> on<00:03:46.640> all<00:03:46.820> of<00:03:46.940> these

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
able to comment on all of these

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.270 
able to comment on all of these
different<00:03:47.269> different<00:03:48.110> industries<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:49.070> play

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
different different industries that play

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.160 
different different industries that play
into<00:03:49.459> the<00:03:50.299> actual<00:03:50.540> production<00:03:50.660> of<00:03:51.049> this

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
into the actual production of this

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.979 
into the actual production of this
architecture<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:52.269> mean<00:03:53.269> that<00:03:53.360> the<00:03:53.570> thing<00:03:53.810> with

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:53.989 
architecture I mean that the thing with

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.690 
architecture I mean that the thing with
some<00:03:54.260> you<00:03:54.769> know<00:03:54.890> all<00:03:55.040> these<00:03:55.220> kind<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:55.489> digital

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
some you know all these kind of digital

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.890 
some you know all these kind of digital
technologies<00:03:56.570> that<00:03:56.780> are<00:03:56.840> available<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:59.480> us<00:03:59.630> is

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
technologies that are available to us is

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.890 
technologies that are available to us is
that<00:03:59.930> it's<00:04:00.799> making<00:04:01.070> every<00:04:01.910> project<00:04:02.120> very<00:04:02.690> very

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
that it's making every project very very

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.599 
that it's making every project very very
specific<00:04:03.530> or<00:04:03.680> it<00:04:03.890> allows<00:04:04.130> us<00:04:04.340> to<00:04:04.489> actually

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
specific or it allows us to actually

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.490 
specific or it allows us to actually
have<00:04:04.850> a<00:04:04.880> much<00:04:05.209> greater<00:04:05.239> range<00:04:05.780> in<00:04:06.109> terms<00:04:06.320> of

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
have a much greater range in terms of

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.259 
have a much greater range in terms of
what<00:04:06.620> we<00:04:06.709> can<00:04:06.859> produce<00:04:06.980> which<00:04:07.940> means<00:04:08.180> that

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
what we can produce which means that

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.369 
what we can produce which means that
every<00:04:08.600> project<00:04:08.780> is<00:04:09.109> is<00:04:09.430> distinctly<00:04:10.430> different

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
every project is is distinctly different

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.080 
every project is is distinctly different
than<00:04:12.379> the<00:04:12.500> next<00:04:12.709> one<00:04:12.860> that<00:04:12.950> we<00:04:13.099> do<00:04:13.280> and<00:04:13.519> in<00:04:14.060> that

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
than the next one that we do and in that

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.920 
than the next one that we do and in that
sense

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
sense

aspects<00:04:35.810> and<00:04:36.020> I<00:04:36.169> think<00:04:36.380> that<00:04:36.560> what<00:04:37.160> we're

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
aspects and I think that what we're

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:40.480 
aspects and I think that what we're
doing<00:04:37.370> here<00:04:37.820> is<00:04:37.850> one<00:04:38.810> track<00:04:39.139> and<00:04:39.470> I<00:04:39.949> would<00:04:40.310> not

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
doing here is one track and I would not

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.550 
doing here is one track and I would not
say<00:04:40.669> that<00:04:40.789> this<00:04:40.940> is<00:04:41.120> the<00:04:41.419> only<00:04:41.600> true<00:04:41.990> only<00:04:42.289> way

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
say that this is the only true only way

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.350 
say that this is the only true only way
that<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:43.009> the<00:04:43.340> architecture<00:04:43.910> industry<00:04:44.270> is

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
that the the architecture industry is

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.360 
that the the architecture industry is
changing<00:04:44.389> or<00:04:44.919> the<00:04:45.919> only<00:04:46.130> kind<00:04:46.310> of

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
changing or the only kind of

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.159 
changing or the only kind of
possibilities<00:04:47.000> for<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:47.270> future<00:04:47.360> but<00:04:47.660> it's

00:04:48.159 --> 00:04:48.169 
possibilities for the future but it's

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.010 
possibilities for the future but it's
definitely<00:04:48.380> something<00:04:48.889> that<00:04:49.039> some<00:04:50.020> that's

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
definitely something that some that's

00:04:51.020 --> 00:05:00.700 
definitely something that some that's
that's<00:04:51.380> going<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:51.680> be<00:04:51.770> quite<00:04:51.919> dominant

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.770
