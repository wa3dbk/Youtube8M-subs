simple tnt cannon using some of the new
features<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.600> 1.7<00:00:54.830> so<00:00:56.660> you<00:00:57.660> may<00:00:57.780> be<00:00:57.840> wondering

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
how I did this especially since this

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.090 
how I did this especially since this
button<00:01:03.230> doesn't<00:01:04.230> really<00:01:04.350> attached<00:01:04.739> to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
technique that I talked about my last

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.740 
technique that I talked about my last
video<00:01:13.250> which<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.760> completely<00:01:15.360> wireless

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
video which is the completely wireless

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.359 
video which is the completely wireless
redstone<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.740> button<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:19.160> what<00:01:20.160> i've<00:01:20.250> done

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
redstone this button and what i've done

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.630 
redstone this button and what i've done
here<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.790> i've<00:01:21.479> used<00:01:21.690> that<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.410> this<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.740> one<00:01:23.610> of

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
here is i've used that so this is one of

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.480 
here is i've used that so this is one of
those<00:01:23.850> buttons<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.570> let<00:01:24.990> me<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.259> go<00:01:25.530> over<00:01:25.560> to

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
those buttons and let me just go over to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.260 
those buttons and let me just go over to
the<00:01:29.930> inside<00:01:30.930> now<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.830> machinery<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.880> makes

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
the inside now the machinery that makes

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.370 
the inside now the machinery that makes
this<00:01:33.360> all<00:01:33.540> so<00:01:34.790> not<00:01:35.790> too<00:01:35.970> bad<00:01:36.200> this<00:01:37.200> is

ticks<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:13.370> motion<00:02:14.370> value<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.820> you<00:02:15.810> know<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.320> on

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
ticks and motion value of you know to on

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.140 
ticks and motion value of you know to on
the<00:02:18.120> x<00:02:18.299> and<00:02:18.870> point<00:02:19.380> 5<00:02:19.530> on<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.739> wide<00:02:20.150> so

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
the x and point 5 on the wide so

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.150 
the x and point 5 on the wide so
basically<00:02:21.840> what<00:02:22.049> that<00:02:22.080> is<00:02:22.320> doing<00:02:22.500> that's

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
forward with two velocity and upwards

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.100 
forward with two velocity and upwards
with<00:02:31.350> point<00:02:31.709> five<00:02:32.070> velocity<00:02:32.820> so<00:02:33.480> kind<00:02:33.810> of<00:02:33.930> the

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
with point five velocity so kind of the

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.610 
with point five velocity so kind of the
very<00:02:34.980> shallow<00:02:35.489> art<00:02:36.140> to<00:02:37.140> look<00:02:37.350> America<00:02:37.799> target

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
very shallow art to look America target

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.330 
very shallow art to look America target
at<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.709> same<00:02:40.980> time<00:02:41.600> i'm<00:02:42.600> summoning<00:02:43.500> slime

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
at the same time i'm summoning slime

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.240 
at the same time i'm summoning slime
with<00:02:44.850> the<00:02:44.940> size<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.570> negative<00:02:46.019> one<00:02:46.410> at<00:02:46.709> the<00:02:47.220> end

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
with the size of negative one at the end

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.460 
with the size of negative one at the end
of<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.459> barrel<00:02:47.610> and<00:02:47.880> what<00:02:48.690> that<00:02:48.840> does<00:02:49.019> that

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
of the barrel and what that does that

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.250 
of the barrel and what that does that
gives<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.980> little<00:02:50.250> smoke<00:02:50.580> effect<00:02:50.970> after<00:02:51.870> you

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
gives the little smoke effect after you

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.300 
gives the little smoke effect after you
shot<00:02:52.560> it<00:02:53.120> so<00:02:54.169> any<00:02:55.169> slime<00:02:55.650> with<00:02:55.859> the<00:02:55.950> size<00:02:56.160> of

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
shot it so any slime with the size of

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.580 
shot it so any slime with the size of
negative<00:02:56.639> one<00:02:56.790> will<00:02:57.750> die<00:02:58.079> immediately

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
negative one will die immediately

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.610 
negative one will die immediately
after<00:02:59.890> its<00:03:00.040> bonded<00:03:01.110> so<00:03:02.110> that's<00:03:03.870> so<00:03:04.870> that's<00:03:04.930> how

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
after its bonded so that's so that's how

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.369 
after its bonded so that's so that's how
it<00:03:05.769> makes<00:03:05.920> the<00:03:06.160> smoke<00:03:06.459> particles<00:03:08.849> this<00:03:09.849> is

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379 
it makes the smoke particles this is

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.530 
it makes the smoke particles this is
making<00:03:11.379> the<00:03:11.470> explosion<00:03:12.010> sound<00:03:12.310> when<00:03:13.239> you<00:03:13.330> fire

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
making the explosion sound when you fire

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.320 
making the explosion sound when you fire
it<00:03:14.430> just<00:03:15.430> adds<00:03:15.670> a<00:03:15.849> bit<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.030> realism<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:18.330> this

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
it just adds a bit of realism and this

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.690 
it just adds a bit of realism and this
summons<00:03:20.049> creeper<00:03:20.680> home<00:03:22.470> with<00:03:23.470> a<00:03:23.500> fuse<00:03:23.830> of<00:03:23.980> 0<00:03:24.220> so

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:24.700 
summons creeper home with a fuse of 0 so

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.119 
summons creeper home with a fuse of 0 so
it<00:03:24.730> explodes<00:03:25.360> immediately<00:03:26.049> that<00:03:26.799> just<00:03:26.980> adds

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
it explodes immediately that just adds

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.820 
it explodes immediately that just adds
kind<00:03:27.340> of<00:03:27.459> an<00:03:27.549> explosion<00:03:28.150> at<00:03:28.269> the<00:03:28.360> beginning<00:03:28.830> so

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
kind of an explosion at the beginning so

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:32.130 
kind of an explosion at the beginning so
once<00:03:30.340> again<00:03:30.519> just<00:03:30.790> kind<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.000> adding<00:03:31.360> more

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
once again just kind of adding more

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.390 
once again just kind of adding more
realism<00:03:34.980> so<00:03:35.980> you<00:03:36.819> fire<00:03:37.180> it<00:03:37.209> off<00:03:37.420> just<00:03:38.349> one<00:03:39.250> more

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
realism so you fire it off just one more

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:45.210 
realism so you fire it off just one more
