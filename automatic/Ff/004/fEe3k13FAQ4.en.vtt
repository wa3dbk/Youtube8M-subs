sugar and cornstarch first thing we need
to<00:00:25.470> do<00:00:53.090> which<00:00:54.090> is<00:00:54.239> kind<00:00:54.480> of<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.629> trickiest

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
to do which is kind of the trickiest

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.610 
to do which is kind of the trickiest
part<00:00:55.289> really<00:00:55.699> so<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.730> cut<00:00:57.180> our<00:00:57.510> trim<00:00:57.780> paper<00:00:57.989> into

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
part really so I cut our trim paper into

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.029 
part really so I cut our trim paper into
three<00:00:59.609> by<00:00:59.760> three<00:01:00.030> squares<00:01:00.559> and<00:01:01.559> we<00:01:01.710> put<00:01:01.890> that

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
three by three squares and we put that

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.770 
three by three squares and we put that
onto<00:01:02.190> these<00:01:02.430> little<00:01:02.730> trays<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.449> could<00:01:03.570> use<00:01:03.750> a

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
onto these little trays you could use a

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.620 
onto these little trays you could use a
pan<00:01:04.589> at<00:01:04.799> home<00:01:04.979> a<00:01:05.250> flat<00:01:05.939> pan<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.420> very

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
pan at home a flat pan it's very

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.770 
pan at home a flat pan it's very
important<00:01:07.110> then<00:01:07.920> we<00:01:08.010> have<00:01:08.159> a<00:01:08.360> ring<00:01:09.360> mold<00:01:09.600> which

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
important then we have a ring mold which

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.390 
important then we have a ring mold which
is<00:01:10.020> two<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.380> a<00:01:10.500> half<00:01:10.680> by<00:01:11.490> three<00:01:11.520> inches<00:01:13.400> just

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
is two and a half by three inches just

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.850 
is two and a half by three inches just
right<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.850> square<00:01:15.150> there<00:01:15.390> and<00:01:16.170> then<00:01:16.530> yet

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
right on the square there and then yet

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.570 
right on the square there and then yet
another<00:01:17.100> piece<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.729> parchment<00:01:18.600> paper<00:01:19.580> it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
another piece of parchment paper it

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.070 
another piece of parchment paper it
doesn't<00:01:20.790> have<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.150> be<00:01:21.240> exact<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.900> these

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
doesn't have to be exact I have these

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080 
doesn't have to be exact I have these
cut<00:01:22.320> for<00:01:22.560> me<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.400> little<00:01:23.909> bit<00:01:24.060> easier

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
cut for me so it's a little bit easier

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.630 
cut for me so it's a little bit easier
for<00:01:24.360> us<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.340> essentially<00:01:26.340> all<00:01:26.369> you're<00:01:26.520> gonna

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
for us but essentially all you're gonna

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.030 
for us but essentially all you're gonna
do<00:01:26.850> is<00:01:26.880> line<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.270> inside<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.869> mold<00:01:28.049> with

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
do is line the inside of the mold with

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.280 
do is line the inside of the mold with
the<00:01:29.130> parchment<00:01:29.400> paper<00:01:30.530> like<00:01:31.530> so<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:33.630> it's

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
the parchment paper like so and if it's

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.170 
the parchment paper like so and if it's
a<00:01:34.470> little<00:01:34.860> bit<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.189> can<00:01:35.280> see<00:01:35.340> there's<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
a little bit you can see there's a

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.030 
a little bit you can see there's a
little<00:01:36.930> bit<00:01:37.079> more<00:01:37.110> ring<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.829> there<00:01:37.920> is

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
little bit more ring and there is

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.609 
little bit more ring and there is
favorite<00:01:38.460> square<00:01:38.820> right<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.210> won't<00:01:39.299> stick<00:01:39.689> so

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
favorite square right it won't stick so

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.880 
favorite square right it won't stick so
that's<00:01:41.869> that's<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.079> important<00:01:43.439> part<00:01:43.649> if<00:01:43.740> it's

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
that's that's the important part if it's

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.710 
that's that's the important part if it's
if<00:01:44.220> it's<00:01:44.340> not<00:01:44.490> flat<00:01:44.820> then<00:01:45.060> what'll<00:01:45.270> happen<00:01:45.450> is

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
if it's not flat then what'll happen is

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.859 
if it's not flat then what'll happen is
the<00:01:46.350> soufflé<00:01:47.009> mix<00:01:47.310> will<00:01:47.520> leak<00:01:48.329> out<00:01:48.479> while<00:01:48.720> it's

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
the soufflé mix will leak out while it's

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.109 
the soufflé mix will leak out while it's
cooking<00:01:49.520> you<00:01:50.520> want<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:50.729> melt<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.970> butter

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
cooking you want to melt the butter

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.240 
cooking you want to melt the butter
first<00:01:51.659> because<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.829> put<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> chocolate

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
first because if you put the chocolate

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.710 
first because if you put the chocolate
in<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.729> you<00:01:53.850> heat<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> chocolate<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.630> the

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
in and you heat the chocolate and the

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.080 
in and you heat the chocolate and the
butter<00:01:54.750> too<00:01:55.590> much<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.219> have<00:01:56.520> a<00:01:56.549> risk<00:01:56.939> of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
butter too much you have a risk of

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.030 
butter too much you have a risk of
burning<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> chocolate<00:01:57.930> which<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.229> pretty

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
burning the chocolate which is pretty

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.550 
burning the chocolate which is pretty
easy<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.460> do<00:01:59.869> but<00:02:00.869> that's<00:02:00.990> probably<00:02:01.259> pretty

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
easy to do but that's probably pretty

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.730 
easy to do but that's probably pretty
good<00:02:01.710> for<00:02:02.670> that

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.969 

all<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:05.829> want<00:02:06.009> to<00:02:06.040> do<00:02:06.220> is<00:02:07.229> emulsify<00:02:08.229> this<00:02:08.500> I'll

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
all I want to do is emulsify this I'll

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.620 
all I want to do is emulsify this I'll
show<00:02:09.009> you<00:02:09.250> what<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.399> mean<00:02:09.580> by<00:02:09.789> moseph<00:02:10.060> I<00:02:10.330> here<00:02:10.539> in

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:10.630 
show you what I mean by moseph I here in

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.309 
show you what I mean by moseph I here in
just<00:02:10.780> a<00:02:10.899> second<00:02:12.060> when<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:13.150> add<00:02:13.270> when<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.200> add

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
just a second when you add when you add

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.520 
just a second when you add when you add
cream<00:02:14.650> or<00:02:15.130> butter<00:02:15.989> anything<00:02:16.989> like<00:02:17.170> that<00:02:17.200> to

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
cream or butter anything like that to

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:18.900 
cream or butter anything like that to
chocolate

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
chocolate

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.030 
chocolate
it<00:02:19.540> breaks<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.989> chocolate<00:02:20.349> apart<00:02:20.590> into<00:02:20.769> its

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
it breaks the chocolate apart into its

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.370 
it breaks the chocolate apart into its
two<00:02:21.310> components<00:02:21.910> and<00:02:22.150> if<00:02:23.080> it's<00:02:23.230> not

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
two components and if it's not

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.910 
two components and if it's not
emulsified<00:02:24.040> you<00:02:24.160> see<00:02:24.400> the<00:02:25.739> separation<00:02:26.739> there

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
emulsified you see the separation there

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.800 
emulsified you see the separation there
with<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.550> what<00:02:27.790> happens<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.300> when<00:02:28.599> you<00:02:28.630> eat

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
with that what happens is when you eat

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:30.960 
with that what happens is when you eat
that<00:02:28.840> chocolate<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:30.040> can<00:02:30.160> taste<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.580> the

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
that chocolate you can taste the the

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:32.250 
that chocolate you can taste the the
graininess<00:02:31.300> of<00:02:31.599> it<00:02:31.720> so<00:02:31.840> you<00:02:31.930> want<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.140> make

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
graininess of it so you want to make

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.220 
graininess of it so you want to make
sure<00:02:32.370> that<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.550> emulsified<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.959> you<00:02:35.050> can

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
sure that it's emulsified and you can

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.710
