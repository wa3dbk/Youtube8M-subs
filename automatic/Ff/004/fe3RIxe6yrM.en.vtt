00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
are you gonna see here I'm like a level

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.020 
are you gonna see here I'm like a level
four<00:01:15.240> hundred<00:01:15.720> something<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.770> my<00:01:16.979> XP<00:01:17.580> bar<00:01:17.820> is

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
four hundred something and my XP bar is

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.570 
four hundred something and my XP bar is
going<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.630> tremendously<00:01:19.500> so<00:01:20.280> if<00:01:20.369> you're<00:01:20.520> a

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
going not tremendously so if you're a

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.530 
going not tremendously so if you're a
low<00:01:20.880> level<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:22.020> could<00:01:22.200> pop<00:01:22.710> off<00:01:22.979> like<00:01:23.610> you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
low level you could pop off like you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.969 
low level you could pop off like you
could<00:01:24.979> get<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.189> five<00:01:26.729> levels<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.979> ten

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
could get like five levels in ten

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.600 
could get like five levels in ten
seconds<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:30.509> me<00:01:30.750> I'm<00:01:31.049> a<00:01:31.259> higher<00:01:31.470> level<00:01:32.070> so<00:01:32.369> it

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
seconds now me I'm a higher level so it

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.859 
seconds now me I'm a higher level so it
takes<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:33.000> while<00:01:33.439> but<00:01:34.439> because<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:35.369> I'm<00:01:36.210> at<00:01:36.600> these

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
takes a while but because I I'm at these

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.789 
takes a while but because I I'm at these
specific<00:01:37.140> training<00:01:37.799> logs<00:01:38.420> there<00:01:39.420> um<00:01:39.799> what's

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
specific training logs there um what's

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.750 
specific training logs there um what's
it<00:01:40.950> called<00:01:41.159> my<00:01:41.759> warming<00:01:42.270> up<00:01:42.420> soup

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
it called my warming up soup

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:48.090 
it called my warming up soup
and<00:01:45.760> if<00:01:46.690> you<00:01:46.870> guys<00:01:47.050> see<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.380> I'm<00:01:47.680> not<00:01:47.710> really

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
and if you guys see that I'm not really

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.340 
and if you guys see that I'm not really
damaging<00:01:48.610> the<00:01:48.760> first<00:01:49.030> log<00:01:49.300> that's<00:01:49.930> okay

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.350 
damaging the first log that's okay

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.750 
damaging the first log that's okay
because<00:01:50.560> my<00:01:51.430> um<00:01:51.730> my<00:01:52.710> nuts<00:01:53.710> RPG<00:01:54.190> is<00:01:54.250> delayed<00:01:54.580> so
