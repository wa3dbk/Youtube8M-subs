00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 friends we are at the workshop 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.450
 extreme hand-to-hand combat 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.490
 chernivtsi western Ukraine i am sharp 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.340
 who watches this video here are our friends 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.969
 who deals with us 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.820
 another lesson 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.859
 seminars and would like to show you how 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.050
 I see the protection from the pistol to 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.880
 sorry here among our friends not 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.650
 it turned out no one had sleeves 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.170
 real gas pistols and 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:29.369
 traumatic yes I mean it hi with 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.219
 Ukraine in Russia's found only here 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.260
 I wanted to show my thoughts on 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.750
 about counting a gun, see 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.750
 so first 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.550
 gun threat very many pundits 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.390
 it is often said that no one is like that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.460
 threaten 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.100
 they do not have such suckers that stand as well 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.879
 express usually always express like this 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.370
 perimeter 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.879
 friends here in this way pleasuring 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.469
 just a professional like that 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.809
 professionals they do not participate not in 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.300
 car disassembly does not jam people 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.980
 outdoors decision normal guys if 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.409
 don't pull out the gun they already shoot 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.140
 so if we talk about the threat 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.950
 real pistol according to statistics 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.140
 practically 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.790
 most often you can see that person 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.290
 threatens with a pistol traumatic 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.600
 real gas as you like 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.549
 just like this or like this 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.170
 as the copper film only recently 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.970
 why 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.650
 What is the psychology of the situation such that 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.640
 unprepared person who 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:30.049
 bought a gun and here it is in any situation 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:32.840
 immediately begins to twitch and begins 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.060
 shoot he himself is afraid that he grandfathers 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.610
 and so for him a gun 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.409
 it is a kind of barrier between danger as 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.330
 we rely not 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.899
 so friends and not pull out 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.299
 toilets like this 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:49.460
 accordingly can shoot and burn 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.439
 from travmatiki in person think it 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.399
 guaranteed drum machines serious 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.700
 injury or change 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.319
 so when I talk about self defense on 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.179
 street about the application of techniques 

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:00.770
 extreme hand-to-hand combat in the street 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:02.030
 in the real conditions of today 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.560
 modern cities 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.440
 it is first necessary 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:11.380
 prepare for a meeting with such a threat 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:15.069
 with so with so well maybe in there 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.120
 basically look youtube look 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.690
 automotive disassembly you'll see that 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:24.140
 threatens him this is for those 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:25.730
 instructors who immediately say that 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.329
 that's how it expresses us all 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.450
 professionals in all places and so 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:34.340
 guys here 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.750
 threat weapon look attention very 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.180
 often we may encounter reception here 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.090
 such that often show in different 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.530
 schools that is it shows like this then 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:49.519
 shows a shock fight 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.160
 this or 5 then they take it like this 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.910
 brush and make leverage 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:58.010
 brushes out friends actually this 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.200
 inefficient technique why because 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.250
 watch it now my friend student 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.760
 the words because I remove my hands begin 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:11.810
 these wave are visible leg and always will 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:14.240
 quieted it will hurt but it's not 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.460
 fatally as soon as I leave the line 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.460
 fire hit a lot he throws his hand 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:24.709
 and shoot me why I wo n't 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:25.820
 time on the famous growling therefore on 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:28.520
 today everything has to be done 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.190
 much more quickly look here 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:33.020
 equipment that I show for my 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.650
 students who are engaged in my 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.720
 system 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.360
 extreme hand-to-hand moonshine 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.520
 look and so i'm leaving the line of fire here 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:47.330
 so burn I'm leaving so I 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.520
 rotate lower back arms climb 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.700
 level 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:55.150
 gun to hand level and goes sharp 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.150
 turn 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:06.500
 all ears survive after this movement 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:10.790
 there is such a movement / gun 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:17.570
 knocked out and after this slew goes a 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:22.460
 and continue to raise the pier price 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:25.550
 flies mechanism once again raising hands care in 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.760
 side and look at what it is based 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:30.090
 disease elbows know that I am this 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:33.120
 hand pulling here 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:38.490
 yourself and your forearm 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.850
 here is this piece of wood 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.740
 the gun is much heavier 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:46.560
 Respectively more weight here if 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.870
 I leave and those take here is the movement 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:05:05.750
 then with this blow you can knock out a gun 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:05:05.750
 much faster and yes it is worth a man 

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:18.180
 hold will present very difficult in such 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:22.110
 positions but even if so 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:23.940
 presumably man had time to the beach 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.610
 arm and here he strained without straining 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:31.639
 you can type more than once 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.639
 several i watch in and 1 1 2 1 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:43.259
 I am convinced that the attack of the enemy 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.889
 need to answer own such 

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:49.349
 only then do you have a chance to stop 

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:51.509
 aggression if you do not know how only 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.039
 defended here the opportunity 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.530
 the only set to come off 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.210
 save them when they are threatened 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.460
 you gun but not always 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:05.720
 situation understand you will have a chance ki 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.720
 forward hi from Chernivtsi
