00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:06.890
 so I want to show you how 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:12.179
 paint with the transition to this area 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:14.400
 this surface was plastered here 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.400
 here we had a scratch me 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.980
 putty necessarily primed further 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.400
 was brought down that is brought to 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.519
 matte state this is to 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.789
 it was possible to paint 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:32.279
 going varnish on thick here and so 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:36.059
 then polish this site on we 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:40.620
 we will paint it here as if all 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:42.989
 entirely that is like this means here already 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.239
 the surface is fully prepared under 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.200
 painting 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:52.500
 it is degreased sealed and now we 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:01:01.050
 will paint paint paint is applied in 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:02.680
 several layers well we started 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.620
 paint 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.450
 Currently there are two layers here, but you can see 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.580
 that the little bit of light is through that is 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.770
 patches are 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.740
 judging by this will have to apply at least 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.740
 five six layers put on 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.010
 so well here are my embedded shabby steel 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:25.480

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.150

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.090
 nikolina 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.810
 you may need to do this 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.810
 now we will block 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.470
 vodka I usually impose a half 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:45.160
 maximum two layers 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:45.160

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.250
 go in there 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.250
 here we go 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.090
 not completely places and 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.500
 firstly by the lake 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.360
 yeah 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.360
 here to be painted because of what we have 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.460
 shut off this door open this 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.770
 after 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.010
 Now passengers can watered windows 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.950
 paint 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:30.750
 and build varnish they are different in color 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.900
 they will 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.920
 this one is higher 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.920
 just a stain 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.780
 and 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.340
 I myself will show another painting which 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.340
 held simultaneously 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.710
 then here it is another painting this 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.060
 it is a real spot 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.910
 that is, the transition means everything is exactly the same 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.920
 stuck like there but only the floor details 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:07.490
 all the detail she waters the word means here 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:07.490
 we are about to sand 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:20.100
 paint we put long kraz 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:25.000
 in my opinion here to the whole and give here 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:28.230
 the transition we have varnish will be here we 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.230
 about here 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:38.620
 after I hide varnish necessarily 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:42.099
 we show you what happens well lacan 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.540
 hid this place of transition we 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:49.680
 sprinkled with transition solvent here 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.680

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.079
