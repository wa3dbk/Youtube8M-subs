00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.649
 should a fulfilling partnership can only be accomplished 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.879
 even though the female part of a connection is experiencing fulfillment 

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.479
 Leave me 

00:00:10.479 --> 00:00:13.389
 when it comes to replenishing Mrs. Red 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.499
 do not compete with scientific expressions 

00:00:16.499 --> 00:00:19.449
 or even medical terms 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.109
 let me make my concepts spaces for ears 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.810
 The same reminiscent of the us-ladies fun park 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.810
 the diminutive wants 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.670
 Why is it that so many brewers never experience a cereal 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.560
 and roll pop through long years of the women's movement Windows Phone 7 on 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.150
 now backwards 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.150
 or lack of attention while on the floor 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.070
 crucial for a successful muesli 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.590
 10 in each case to wear with love selected 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.520
 all fresh fruits like apples pears and plums 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.170
 so hurt the most important thing 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.830
 big must 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.040
 Segal popbands or rubbed 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.170
 where it hardly makes a difference whether the cereal comes from the finished why 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.170
 or freshly prepared 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.869
 much more crucial is that it is prepared with love and dedication and 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:20.869
 I just stayed up high pressure 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.690
 a strong miceli for brunch 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.170
 neither a diocese of the foundation for the whole day 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.270
 and makes it easy in the sweet temptations in between 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.990
 resist 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.170
 How would you prefer Mainau? 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.480
 when they bring their life partner 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.760
 who have taken the stony path with them 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.760
 once with a muesli surprise 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.250
 in the way our American friends take it, too little Prix 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.800
 and West of Art 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.800
 with cowboy hat and boots holding devotion 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.800
 We should never forget this with Allah 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.600
 what most of our grandmothers have come to good German or here 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.340
 to have known a cereal 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.089
 the exhibition should be enlightened deeds every woman can afford a cereal 

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:11.879
 some even in professional life is even several times a day 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:15.039
 perhaps 

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:16.929
 they would be straight 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:21.089
 while I talk to them lonely at home a cereal in itself 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:23.059
 in 

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:26.059
 then you should keep in mind that this is the exception 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.329
 because for two it tastes best 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:33.049
 as a hearty conclusion of a love that is possible again 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:35.149
 also in a marriage 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:38.149
 Enjoy your meal 

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:55.149
 I may now invite me to follow out of the inhospitality of ours 

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:59.179
 becoming uninhabitable because it put him on them to preserve poetry 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.319
 Bones on a cloud of soft dreams 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.290
 one of our most sensitive 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.290
 Poets and songwriters awake 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.779
 Euro 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:13.879
 Biel Breuer Runge and Roary Sky 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:15.999
 Flowers and how would 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:17.909
 would pass away 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:19.349
 Bush stays 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.329
 Koichi 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.009
 and in the beginning 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.489
 I would like to have you today both new rails so imagine 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.149
 Schirinzi both foul the stories 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:33.649
 on the narrowly directed area between already speaking traffic 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:39.019
 it shows how close in our currency tenderness and brutality 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.519
 at the other leagues 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.839
 at the word 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:46.289
 let's think that we have to go to a show process in the broad and already have 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.629
 and that needs to be protected 

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.959
 But we also think of people who were alone on vacation alone life 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:57.459
 alone Lieberman 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.509
 I send and talk on their dinghies Schwartz 

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:02.549
 and turns in a circle 

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.010
 and are afraid of the hole in the middle that is in a bit 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.449
 establish 

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:09.679
 But I want to grow and friends have me when I am at the moment 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:13.109
 played and brought for a year 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:16.220
 and so went the barricades partner or partner mounter when a boy 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:17.370
 Man never plays 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.719
 to keep a memory 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:20.859
 Boro bow 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:22.370
 and tell about it 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.370
 my crazy little story 

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:29.830
 November evening 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:31.249
 pedestrian zone 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:34.249
 Take a stand 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.599
 they could 

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.029
 Roetgen 

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.830

 immediate proximity we see 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.620

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.419
 Dirk Leun 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:21.499
 Ladies and gentlemen, I may now create a Malysz to him 

00:06:21.499 --> 00:06:22.680
 a lawn 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.180
 I want to entertain distribution 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:27.339
 at the German bank 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:31.589
 Percent there they will of course ask why the German bank needs one 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:35.449
 Entertainment evening payment, the question should not be correct why 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:38.539
 the Federal Republic still needs a federal government 

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:41.610
 if the city ladies and gentlemen then I'll connect him 

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:44.629

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:49.210
 she'll agree with her if I say that Sony is the German bank in 

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:52.029
 Germany is running with more today 

00:06:52.029 --> 00:06:54.580
 no German company of importance 

00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:57.589
 no matter if Porsche is an animal or a nixdorf 

00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:00.989
 among the crucial changes without our advice 

00:07:01.619 --> 00:07:04.339

 as the best for our parliamentary democracy in mind 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:18.240
 allow me at this point as they have a common misconception
