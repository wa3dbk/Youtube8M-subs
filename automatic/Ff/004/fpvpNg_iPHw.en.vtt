00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:09.830 

 it<00:04:01.060> now

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.710 

so<00:04:10.349> the<00:04:10.650> gals<00:04:10.920> had<00:04:11.250> actually<00:04:11.640> been<00:04:11.940> in<00:04:12.000> this

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
so the gals had actually been in this

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.300 
so the gals had actually been in this
party<00:04:13.230> grazing

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
party grazing

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.400 
party grazing
set<00:04:15.180> it<00:04:15.330> over<00:04:15.660> in<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.900> other<00:04:15.959> one

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:17.410 
set it over in the other one

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:19.830 
set it over in the other one
the<00:04:17.890> grass<00:04:18.100> will<00:04:18.430> go<00:04:18.580> a<00:04:19.030> little<00:04:19.330> something

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
the grass will go a little something

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.110 
the grass will go a little something
more<00:04:20.350> like<00:04:20.620> that

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.900 

so<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:24.840> Pataca<00:04:25.470> the<00:04:26.040> exact<00:04:26.430> same<00:04:26.700> grass<00:04:27.180> but

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
so that Pataca the exact same grass but

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:31.940 
so that Pataca the exact same grass but
that's<00:04:29.910> what<00:04:30.090> it<00:04:30.210> ends<00:04:30.510> up<00:04:30.600> like<00:04:30.870> when<00:04:31.110> slide

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
that's what it ends up like when slide

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.120 
that's what it ends up like when slide
stop<00:04:32.370> graze<00:04:32.669> on<00:04:32.970> it

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
stop graze on it

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.900 
stop graze on it
instead<00:04:35.700> of<00:04:35.820> flogging<00:04:36.300> me<00:04:36.420> off<00:04:36.630> the<00:04:37.080> tractors

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:37.910 
instead of flogging me off the tractors

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.740 
instead of flogging me off the tractors
slashing<00:04:38.910> all<00:04:39.060> this

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750

oh<00:05:08.290> boy

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.770 

this<00:05:12.950> is<00:05:13.130> what<00:05:13.310> you<00:05:13.460> call<00:05:13.730> painting<00:05:14.630> the

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
Harbour Bridge really feels like I'm

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.530 
Harbour Bridge really feels like I'm
getting<00:05:18.200> gnarly

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.410 

but

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.420 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:30.260 

a<00:05:26.480> lot<00:05:26.960> of<00:05:27.350> out<00:05:27.650> here

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.570 

I<00:05:30.390> think<00:05:30.990> that's<00:05:31.170> actually<00:05:31.350> at<00:05:31.620> five<00:05:31.860> I<00:05:32.130> live

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
I think that's actually at five I live

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:39.150 
I think that's actually at five I live
just<00:05:32.610> write<00:05:33.000> an<00:05:33.060> article

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.270 

so<00:05:39.490> I<00:05:39.520> gotta<00:05:39.880> keep<00:05:40.120> a<00:05:40.420> pretty<00:05:41.140> close<00:05:41.530> eye<00:05:41.830> on

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
so I gotta keep a pretty close eye on

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.180 
so I gotta keep a pretty close eye on
the<00:05:42.640> temperature

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
the temperature

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.460 
the temperature
probably<00:05:46.090> guess<00:05:46.390> why<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:49.540> seed<00:05:49.870> heads<00:05:50.170> on

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
probably guess why the seed heads on

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.080 
probably guess why the seed heads on
Soteria<00:05:51.370> just<00:05:51.640> explode<00:05:52.630> into<00:05:53.460> seeds<00:05:54.460> and<00:05:54.760> dust

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
Soteria just explode into seeds and dust

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.560 
Soteria just explode into seeds and dust
when<00:05:55.420> they're<00:05:55.630> hit<00:05:56.640> southern<00:05:57.640> as<00:05:58.270> you

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 
when they're hit southern as you

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:03.230 
when they're hit southern as you
probably<00:05:59.140> expect<00:06:00.120> it<00:06:01.120> just<00:06:01.540> cloves

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
probably expect it just cloves

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.820 
probably expect it just cloves
