cobblestone<00:00:26.539> just<00:00:27.539> move<00:00:27.660> over<00:00:27.810> here<00:00:27.990> out<00:00:28.140> of

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
cobblestone just move over here out of

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the way and you're gonna want to build a

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.260 
the way and you're gonna want to build a
cobblestone<00:00:30.929> tower<00:00:31.289> at<00:00:31.980> least<00:00:32.250> 24<00:00:32.969> blocks

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
cobblestone tower at least 24 blocks

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:42.470 
cobblestone tower at least 24 blocks
high<00:00:33.600> so<00:00:33.989> we<00:00:34.320> got<00:00:34.469> 1<00:00:34.890> 2<00:00:39.980> 5<00:00:40.980> so<00:00:41.370> I<00:00:41.399> found<00:00:41.730> 25<00:00:42.210> high

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
high so we got 1 2 5 so I found 25 high

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.610 
high so we got 1 2 5 so I found 25 high
which<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:42.930> what<00:00:43.050> I've<00:00:43.140> done<00:00:43.260> that<00:00:43.350> one<00:00:43.469> over

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
platform that's 21 squares by 21 so I'll

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.459 
platform that's 21 squares by 21 so I'll
do<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:49.920> for<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.280> now

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
high platform of 8x8 so I'll just do

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.820 
high platform of 8x8 so I'll just do
that<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.310> each<00:02:05.399> corner<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:09.800> something<00:02:10.800> like

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
I wall left still on the platforms you

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.349 
I wall left still on the platforms you
should<00:02:16.439> have<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:16.920> three<00:02:17.400> space<00:02:17.760> gap<00:02:18.060> between

should have a three space gap between

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.660 
should have a three space gap between
each<00:02:18.569> platform<00:02:19.159> now<00:02:20.159> what<00:02:20.310> you<00:02:20.400> want<00:02:20.519> to<00:02:20.579> do

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
each platform now what you want to do

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.339 
each platform now what you want to do
once<00:02:20.909> you<00:02:21.000> build<00:02:21.209> those<00:02:21.450> platforms<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:22.200> want

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
once you build those platforms you want

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.839 
once you build those platforms you want
to<00:02:22.409> build<00:02:22.500> your<00:02:22.620> roof<00:02:22.829> over<00:02:23.189> it<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:23.579> you're

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
to build your roof over it so you're

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.880 
to build your roof over it so you're
going<00:02:23.969> to<00:02:24.000> have<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.239> start<00:02:24.510> from<00:02:24.599> there<00:02:24.930> so<00:02:25.769> on

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
going to have to start from there so on

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.140 
going to have to start from there so on
the<00:02:25.980> platform's<00:02:26.459> then<00:02:26.579> you'll<00:02:26.700> have<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.879> too

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
the platform's then you'll have a too

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.869 
the platform's then you'll have a too
high<00:02:27.260> space<00:02:28.260> for<00:02:28.829> your<00:02:28.920> mobs<00:02:29.129> to<00:02:29.310> spawn<00:02:29.549> on<00:02:29.790> the

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
high space for your mobs to spawn on the

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.420 
high space for your mobs to spawn on the
platform's<00:02:30.450> so<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.260> don't<00:02:31.470> want<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.680> build

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
platform's so you don't want to build

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.509 
platform's so you don't want to build
your<00:02:32.549> roof<00:02:32.700> all<00:02:32.909> the<00:02:33.030> way<00:02:33.150> across<00:02:34.250> okay<00:02:35.250> and

your roof all the way across okay and
once<00:02:35.909> you<00:02:36.060> finish<00:02:36.299> a<00:02:36.420> roof<00:02:36.780> you're<00:02:37.680> going<00:02:37.950> to

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
once you finish a roof you're going to

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.309 
once you finish a roof you're going to
want<00:02:38.220> to<00:02:38.310> have<00:02:38.640> your<00:02:39.030> buckets<00:02:39.420> of<00:02:39.540> water<00:02:39.689> and

fill your water buckets up if you put
one<00:02:55.049> in<00:02:55.079> each<00:02:55.230> corner<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.980> create<00:02:56.220> an

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
one in each corner you create an

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.610 
one in each corner you create an
infinite<00:02:56.669> water<00:02:56.790> source<00:02:56.939> but<00:02:57.359> there<00:02:57.930> so

survival mode in case you die no I just
set<00:03:37.349> time<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.949> day<00:03:38.909> because<00:03:39.209> this<00:03:39.329> trap<00:03:39.629> works

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
set time to day because this trap works

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.990 
set time to day because this trap works
best<00:03:40.260> in<00:03:40.530> a<00:03:40.620> day<00:03:40.799> and<00:03:41.069> it<00:03:41.159> works<00:03:41.250> best<00:03:41.549> on<00:03:41.760> them

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
best in a day and it works best on them

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.569 
best in a day and it works best on them
flat-ish<00:03:42.840> lungs<00:03:43.290> so<00:03:44.220> you<00:03:44.250> don't<00:03:44.400> want<00:03:44.519> to

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
flat-ish lungs so you don't want to

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.129 
flat-ish lungs so you don't want to
build<00:03:44.669> this<00:03:44.879> in<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.120> middle<00:03:45.269> of<00:03:45.359> a<00:03:45.449> hill<00:03:45.629> you

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
want to build it on top of the hill or

00:03:47.190 --> 00:04:01.460 
want to build it on top of the hill or
something<00:03:50.659> okay<00:03:52.400> these<00:03:53.400> guys<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.959> should<00:04:01.229> see

something okay these guys you should see

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.750 
something okay these guys you should see
soon<00:04:01.799> that<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.939> mobs<00:04:03.150> ow<00:04:04.220> mobs<00:04:05.220> to<00:04:05.400> start<00:04:05.639> to

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
soon that the mobs ow mobs to start to

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.030 
soon that the mobs ow mobs to start to
fall

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.400 

there<00:04:10.040> we<00:04:10.130> go<00:04:10.280> they<00:04:11.000> honest<00:04:11.360> and<00:04:11.630> already<00:04:11.780> look

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.120 

and<00:04:15.410> this<00:04:16.310> trap<00:04:16.760> works<00:04:17.060> really<00:04:17.329> well<00:04:17.680> and<00:04:18.680> you

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
and this trap works really well and you

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.390 
and this trap works really well and you
can<00:04:19.160> collect<00:04:19.489> a<00:04:19.700> lot<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:20.920> otherwise<00:04:21.920> difficult

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
can collect a lot of otherwise difficult

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.430 
can collect a lot of otherwise difficult
to<00:04:22.490> get<00:04:22.640> earlier<00:04:22.940> in<00:04:23.060> the<00:04:23.150> game<00:04:23.330> items<00:04:24.200> like

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
to get earlier in the game items like

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.680 
to get earlier in the game items like
gunpowder<00:04:24.680> and<00:04:25.280> arrows<00:04:25.850> and<00:04:26.180> stuff<00:04:26.360> like<00:04:26.510> that

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
gunpowder and arrows and stuff like that

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:30.190 
gunpowder and arrows and stuff like that
so<00:04:27.550> obviously<00:04:28.550> this<00:04:29.060> is<00:04:29.180> the<00:04:29.750> trap<00:04:30.020> that

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
so obviously this is the trap that

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.360 
so obviously this is the trap that
you're<00:04:30.320> going<00:04:30.440> to<00:04:30.500> want<00:04:30.650> to<00:04:30.710> set<00:04:30.980> up<00:04:31.070> quite<00:04:31.250> an

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
you're going to want to set up quite an

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:32.650 
you're going to want to set up quite an
early<00:04:31.430> on<00:04:31.700> if<00:04:31.820> you<00:04:31.910> want<00:04:32.030> to<00:04:32.060> collect<00:04:32.240> all<00:04:32.419> the
