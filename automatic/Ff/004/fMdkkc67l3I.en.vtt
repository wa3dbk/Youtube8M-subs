00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:14.730
 flat together I'll show you today how 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.800
 you can crochet for this 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.990
 I use smc bravo at home 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.680
 nets in a bright red color i 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.510
 have a 45 mm 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:30.230
 then of course we need one 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:34.430
 Gummiband now a whole 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:38.940
 commercial tape for the household 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.149
 to relocate one week later and one 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.149
 scissors 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:49.020
 We start with a usual one at first 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.780
 claude form to place such a circular 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.149
 the long thread under the circle and she 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.550
 in these questions through the circle 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.829
 that does not make the roma up and there 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.530
 if the hook comes then we like to pull that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:07.799
 Now we have this button at the beginning 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:12.530
 Let's take our rubber band 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:15.600
 from the front through the rubber band by 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.049
 grab the drive from the new 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.049
 coming 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.020
 and she in this thread through the 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.100
 rubber band with the hook through 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.100
 a little bit up 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.759
 if we did that 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.530
 gives up here a second sleep then 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:40.229
 Let's get the rides on the 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.810
 hook and it is through the two 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.280
 This results in a solid industry 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.380
 mesh and we will now that 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:52.360
 all the time we also pick up 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:55.300
 still the long drive forward with it 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:59.830
 we can get in with it, then 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:04.440
 we practically go through it 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.440
 elastic band and under these short thread 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:14.790
 pick up the thread and pull through 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.790
 the two do not apply 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.470
 what we do now quite often 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:35.409
 we do not need to go along 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:39.069
 We do that quite often now and that 

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:40.720
 Rubber band is very elastic that is 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.269
 We always have to do it after a while 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.799
 pull it so it comes out further 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:49.480
 because we have to do that too 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.540
 possibility to give to which the 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.970
 means we have to do a lot more now 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.920
 on rules as now on the rubber band 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.829
 that's why it fits in the condition 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.829
 always nice to pull out the tape and 

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:08.040
 further over in the tight stitches 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:25.989
 that starts to bark so it 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:25.989
 he realized that we have more on it than 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:32.920
 in the stretched state quite well over 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:04:03.049
 All should have called itself 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:04:07.250
 so that it offers space and if you think 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:10.299
 you have a lot of luck if you 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.340
 thinks this is sufficient 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:15.290
 then we can close the whole thing 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.000
 that means we go with the hook now 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.209
 through the first machine we made 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.209
 to have 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:27.180
 close the whole with a chain that 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.610
 means we get the yarn and pull that 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.020
 through all stitches 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.820
 I have to follow the previous year 

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.410
 to go in again through the first one was 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:46.830
 already pull that through all stitches 

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:58.140
 so cut through by the experience 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:05:03.750
 last machine involved a bit 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:12.260
 We take the stitches on the rubber 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:17.750
 the needle is missing that here through and 

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:17.750
 can lose the thread 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:35.610
 Be careful that the thread somewhere 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.240
 it will always be that way 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.240
 apart 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.570
 the knotted the thread again 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:12.990
 can cut off the rubbers ready 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.930
 have fun until the next one 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.930
 love it here
