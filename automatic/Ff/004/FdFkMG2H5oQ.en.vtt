the windows if you were to do that with

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.050 
the windows if you were to do that with
liquid<00:03:33.830> glue<00:03:34.010> you<00:03:34.400> would<00:03:34.550> have<00:03:34.670> to<00:03:34.760> set<00:03:34.940> this

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
liquid glue you would have to set this

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.660 
liquid glue you would have to set this
aside<00:03:35.120> for<00:03:35.720> probably<00:03:36.320> a<00:03:36.530> good<00:03:36.800> two<00:03:37.070> hours<00:03:37.100> to

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
aside for probably a good two hours to

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.850 
aside for probably a good two hours to
let<00:03:37.820> it<00:03:37.970> dry<00:03:38.180> without<00:03:38.690> having<00:03:39.590> to<00:03:39.710> worry<00:03:39.800> about

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
touching it with the xyron machine

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.860 
touching it with the xyron machine
that's<00:03:42.020> essentially<00:03:42.650> dry<00:03:43.160> instantly<00:03:43.690> so<00:03:44.690> that

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
that's essentially dry instantly so that

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.500 
that's essentially dry instantly so that
makes<00:03:45.140> it<00:03:45.350> perfect<00:03:46.010> you<00:03:46.280> can<00:03:47.030> just<00:03:47.210> zip<00:03:47.450> right

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
makes it perfect you can just zip right

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.950 
makes it perfect you can just zip right
on<00:03:48.100> and<00:03:49.100> one<00:03:49.310> of<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.460> ways<00:03:49.610> you<00:03:49.910> can<00:03:50.120> set
