also made a video about in a little dish

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.899 
also made a video about in a little dish
so<00:01:31.579> that<00:01:31.609> I<00:01:31.759> don't<00:01:31.820> lose<00:01:32.149> the<00:01:32.420> hardware<00:01:32.810> a

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
so that I don't lose the hardware a

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.690 
so that I don't lose the hardware a
little<00:01:34.909> teeny<00:01:35.119> tiny<00:01:35.450> things<00:01:35.749> like<00:01:35.840> this<00:01:36.170> but

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:36.700 
little teeny tiny things like this but

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.099 
little teeny tiny things like this but
if<00:01:37.700> you<00:01:37.789> stay<00:01:37.999> organized<00:01:38.539> you<00:01:38.749> should<00:01:38.929> be<00:01:39.020> okay

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:41.109 
if you stay organized you should be okay

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:43.749 
if you stay organized you should be okay

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
so that's it that's how the ends come

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.300 
so that's it that's how the ends come
off<00:01:44.590> and<00:01:45.590> they<00:01:45.979> just<00:01:46.189> you<00:01:46.640> know<00:01:46.689> slide<00:01:48.310> on

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:49.310

00:01:54.879 --> 00:01:54.889 
these bowls and you just use the wing

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:57.190 
these bowls and you just use the wing
nuts<00:01:55.100> to<00:01:55.189> hold<00:01:55.280> it<00:01:55.579> secure<00:01:55.999> so<00:01:56.479> I<00:01:56.810> really<00:01:57.049> like

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200
