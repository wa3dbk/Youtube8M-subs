seats<00:00:36.719> and<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.829> reason<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.129> call<00:00:38.340> it<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.700> is

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
seats and the reason I call it that is

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.580 
seats and the reason I call it that is
because<00:00:38.910> it's<00:00:39.390> different<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.989> what<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.379> get

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
because it's different to what you get

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.770 
because it's different to what you get
in<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> stores<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:44.239> that's<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.539> one<00:00:45.660> that

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
in the stores and that's the one that

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.350 
in the stores and that's the one that
you<00:00:45.899> can<00:00:46.050> get<00:00:46.170> in<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.320> store<00:00:46.379> I<00:00:46.969> just<00:00:47.969> put<00:00:48.239> it

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
you can get in the store I just put it

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.270 
you can get in the store I just put it
next<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.289> shake-shake<00:00:49.590> bridge<00:00:49.770> Thomas

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.069 
next to the shake-shake bridge Thomas
you<00:00:51.239> can<00:00:51.300> see<00:00:51.570> there's<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.809> bit<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:51.960> a

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
you can see there's a bit of a

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.410 
you can see there's a bit of a
difference<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.590> face<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.910> like<00:00:54.149> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:56.390 
that so there's something sort of wrong

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.800 
that so there's something sort of wrong
with<00:03:56.480> his<00:03:56.600> gears<00:03:56.870> because<00:03:58.090> if<00:03:59.090> you<00:03:59.330> look

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
with his gears because if you look

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.450 
with his gears because if you look
particularly<00:04:00.080> this<00:04:00.350> sort<00:04:00.590> of<00:04:00.650> jumping

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:03.460 
particularly this sort of jumping

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.380 
particularly this sort of jumping
where's<00:04:04.460> the<00:04:04.880> other<00:04:05.000> one

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:05.390 
where's the other one

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:10.750 
where's the other one
trail<00:04:06.050> was<00:04:06.170> nice<00:04:06.350> and<00:04:06.530> smooth<00:04:09.520> so<00:04:10.520> we'll<00:04:10.640> let's

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
trail was nice and smooth so we'll let's

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.240 
trail was nice and smooth so we'll let's
try<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:11.090> the<00:04:11.660> first<00:04:11.690> Thomas<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.980> one<00:04:13.130> that

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
try it the first Thomas the one that

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:24.260

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:34.589 

then<00:04:25.270> we'll<00:04:25.480> try<00:04:25.780> the<00:04:25.840> other<00:04:25.990> way

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
amazing and since I've got to shake

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.619 
amazing and since I've got to shake
shake<00:06:28.289> bridges<00:06:28.680> it's<00:06:29.369> possible<00:06:30.240> that<00:06:30.449> I'll

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:30.629 
shake bridges it's possible that I'll

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:34.759 
shake bridges it's possible that I'll
make<00:06:30.990> a<00:06:31.610> another<00:06:32.610> video<00:06:33.349> combining<00:06:34.349> the<00:06:34.499> two

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:34.769 
make a another video combining the two

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:37.549 
make a another video combining the two
bridges<00:06:35.099> together<00:06:35.519> and<00:06:36.360> that<00:06:37.019> would<00:06:37.139> be<00:06:37.289> an

00:06:37.549 --> 00:06:37.559 
bridges together and that would be an

00:06:37.559 --> 00:06:42.259 
bridges together and that would be an
ultimate<00:06:38.099> shake<00:06:38.699> shake<00:06:38.849> bridge<00:06:38.969> set<00:06:40.189> so<00:06:41.269> the

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:42.269 
ultimate shake shake bridge set so the

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:45.469 
ultimate shake shake bridge set so the
unit<00:06:42.689> goes<00:06:42.869> my<00:06:43.740> unboxing<00:06:44.069> video<00:06:44.579> and<00:06:44.879> first

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:45.479 
unit goes my unboxing video and first

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:50.299 
unit goes my unboxing video and first
run<00:06:45.719> of<00:06:45.930> the<00:06:46.379> shake-shake<00:06:47.279> bridge<00:06:48.379> and<00:06:49.379> just

00:06:50.299 --> 00:06:50.309 
run of the shake-shake bridge and just

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:53.779 
run of the shake-shake bridge and just
to<00:06:50.459> end<00:06:50.579> the<00:06:50.699> video<00:06:50.909> we'll<00:06:51.809> add<00:06:52.019> a<00:06:52.589> carriage<00:06:53.490> on

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:53.789 
to end the video we'll add a carriage on

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:56.569 
to end the video we'll add a carriage on
Thomas<00:06:54.419> and<00:06:54.659> see<00:06:55.619> how<00:06:55.889> he<00:06:55.949> goes<00:06:56.219> with<00:06:56.550> a

00:06:56.569 --> 00:06:56.579 
Thomas and see how he goes with a

00:06:56.579 --> 00:07:11.460 
Thomas and see how he goes with a
carriage

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:11.470
