00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:08.220
 hi novice guitarists and I have for 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:11.550
 you news today is certainly not a secret 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.780
 that most novice guitarists are not 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.780
 can tune a guitar 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.210
 to tune in dark tuners 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.250
 need to buy in the store in the store he 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.890
 costs 400 600 rubles 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.039
 Do not everyone where they live have such 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.610
 shops where you can buy 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:38.510
 but almost everyone has these 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:43.170
 phones or android or on windows 8 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:49.739
 Here I have for example a phone on windows 8 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:53.129
 and there is an application and paid and 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.660
 free in the store you know android 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:00.539
 market or windows market and now if we 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:05.489
 let's go in the application and dial in 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:12.380
 search our word bye and find what 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.380
 we will see here these tuners will be 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:16.159
 Nemer 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:28.290
 and we just need to choose here see 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:33.520
 opposite these tuners there is this very 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:38.020
 stars and where stars are bigger then y 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.229
 we will be better, and we choose who 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.060
 paid who is free 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:46.540
 it is not known what will even be better paid 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:52.330
 or for free it's your business here 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:55.150
 when we pick ourselves install it then 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.860
 we will have myself here one of 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.860
 set such tuners 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:08.890
 he looks like this 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:13.270
 I talk and there is an arrow running 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:19.900
 see that's why the tuner 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:23.350
 we can tune the guitar with you 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.350
 all and do not need to buy anything and tuner from 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.549
 we will always be with us in our pockets where 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:37.450
 we would not have the same phone almost everything with 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:40.150
 a drag everywhere so that's all all 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.330
