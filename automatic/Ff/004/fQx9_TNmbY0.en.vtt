00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
this particular apparatus that I'm about

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.570 
this particular apparatus that I'm about
to<00:00:18.660> show<00:00:18.869> you<00:00:18.900> is<00:00:19.020> called<00:00:19.170> a<00:00:19.699> pre<00:00:20.699> chiller<00:00:21.660> or<00:00:21.960> a

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
to show you is called a pre chiller or a

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.099 
to show you is called a pre chiller or a
pre-work<00:00:23.580> chiller<00:00:24.590> so<00:00:25.880> this<00:00:26.880> little<00:00:27.150> guy<00:00:27.449> here

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
pre-work chiller so this little guy here

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.950 
pre-work chiller so this little guy here
looks<00:00:28.769> a<00:00:29.010> lot<00:00:29.220> like<00:00:29.580> our<00:00:29.910> standard<00:00:30.599> worked

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
looks a lot like our standard worked

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.970 
looks a lot like our standard worked
chiller<00:00:31.700> now<00:00:32.700> what<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> word<00:00:33.870> chiller<00:00:34.260> does<00:00:34.590> is

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
chiller now what a word chiller does is

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.910 
chiller now what a word chiller does is
and<00:00:35.790> I'm<00:00:36.000> going<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.239> bring<00:00:36.630> one<00:00:36.840> into<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.290> shot

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
and I'm going to bring one into the shot

and I'm going to bring one into the shot
hear<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.489> word<00:00:39.300> chiller<00:00:39.780> it's<00:00:40.469> something<00:00:40.739> that

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
hear a word chiller it's something that

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.220 
hear a word chiller it's something that
you<00:00:41.160> would<00:00:41.309> put<00:00:41.550> down<00:00:41.879> into<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> beer<00:00:43.020> at<00:00:43.140> the

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
you would put down into the beer at the

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.410 
you would put down into the beer at the
end<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.620> boil<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.579> would<00:00:44.760> run<00:00:44.969> cool

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
end of the boil and you would run cool

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.340 
end of the boil and you would run cool
water<00:00:46.200> from<00:00:46.739> your<00:00:46.770> from<00:00:47.520> your<00:00:47.550> tap<00:00:48.350> from

enables you to adapt it to your faucet
well<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:57.960> simply<00:00:58.410> hook<00:00:58.620> this<00:00:58.859> up<00:00:59.129> off<00:00:59.399> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
well you simply hook this up off the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.599 
well you simply hook this up off the
female<00:01:00.510> end<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.050> run<00:01:01.620> cool<00:01:01.920> water<00:01:02.190> through<00:01:02.579> it

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
female end and run cool water through it

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.070 
female end and run cool water through it
well<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.080> south<00:01:04.350> we're<00:01:05.159> in<00:01:05.339> Austin<00:01:05.760> Texas

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
well in the south we're in Austin Texas

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.530 
well in the south we're in Austin Texas
it's<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.409> real<00:01:07.799> cool<00:01:08.250> when<00:01:08.670> summer<00:01:09.150> around

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
it's not real cool when summer around

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.950 
it's not real cool when summer around
here<00:01:09.900> it's<00:01:10.110> really<00:01:10.590> hot<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.630> subsequently<00:01:12.630> a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
here it's really hot so subsequently a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.740 
here it's really hot so subsequently a
lot<00:01:13.500> of<00:01:13.650> folks<00:01:13.890> will<00:01:14.189> use<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> pre<00:01:14.909> chiller<00:01:15.270> so

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
lot of folks will use a pre chiller so

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.649 
lot of folks will use a pre chiller so
this<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> pre<00:01:16.560> chiller<00:01:17.000> what's<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.150> concept

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this is a pre chiller what's the concept

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.560 
this is a pre chiller what's the concept
you<00:01:19.470> take<00:01:19.740> your<00:01:19.920> garden<00:01:20.280> hose<00:01:20.490> water<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.270> run

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
you take your garden hose water you run

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.990 
you take your garden hose water you run
it<00:01:21.689> through<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.080> guy<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.070> put<00:01:23.340> this<00:01:23.700> guy

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
it through this guy and you put this guy

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.440 
it through this guy and you put this guy
into<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> big<00:01:24.780> bucket<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.439> ice<00:01:25.619> water<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:27.030> what

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
into a big bucket of ice water so what

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.340 
into a big bucket of ice water so what
it<00:01:27.540> does<00:01:27.750> it<00:01:27.930> runs<00:01:28.290> through<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:29.820> cool<00:01:30.360> the<00:01:30.630> tap

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
it does it runs through the cool the tap

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.399 
it does it runs through the cool the tap
water<00:01:31.380> will<00:01:31.829> run<00:01:32.070> through<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.729> ice<00:01:32.909> water

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
water will run through the ice water

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.280 
water will run through the ice water
chilling<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.560> down<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.729> when<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:37.020> take

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
chilling it down so that when you take

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.380 
chilling it down so that when you take
the<00:01:37.500> male<00:01:37.740> connection<00:01:38.460> you<00:01:38.790> hook<00:01:38.970> it<00:01:39.000> up<00:01:39.240> with

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
the male connection you hook it up with

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.950 
the male connection you hook it up with
the<00:01:39.479> female<00:01:39.960> from<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> work<00:01:41.070> chiller<00:01:41.400> itself

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
the female from the work chiller itself

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.960 
the female from the work chiller itself
once<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.170> water<00:01:43.409> gets<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> chiller<00:01:44.369> it's

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
once the water gets to the chiller it's

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.050 
once the water gets to the chiller it's
already<00:01:45.270> pre<00:01:45.630> chilled<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.200> little<00:01:46.439> bit<00:01:46.649> so<00:01:47.060> this

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
already pre chilled a little bit so this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.139 
already pre chilled a little bit so this
guy<00:01:48.270> really<00:01:48.840> helps<00:01:49.470> if<00:01:49.649> your<00:01:50.220> water<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.759> hot

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
guy really helps if your water is hot

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.660 
guy really helps if your water is hot
coming<00:01:51.630> out<00:01:51.720> of<00:01:51.750> your<00:01:51.930> tap<00:01:52.200> if<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:53.250> water<00:01:53.460> is

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
coming out of your tap if your water is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.499 
coming out of your tap if your water is
fairly<00:01:54.180> cool<00:01:54.680> maybe<00:01:55.680> below<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.549> know<00:01:56.670> 70

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
fairly cool maybe below you know 70

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.660 
fairly cool maybe below you know 70
degrees<00:01:57.810> or<00:01:58.049> so<00:01:58.259> you're<00:01:58.710> probably<00:01:58.950> okay<00:01:59.430> with

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
degrees or so you're probably okay with

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.719 
degrees or so you're probably okay with
this<00:01:59.820> guy<00:02:00.060> but<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:01.020> your<00:02:01.530> water's<00:02:01.950> hot<00:02:02.310> coming

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
this guy but if your water's hot coming

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.639 
this guy but if your water's hot coming
at<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:02.939> tap<00:02:03.149> like<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.719> here<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:04.020> Texas<00:02:04.500> a

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
at the tap like it is here in Texas a

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.229 
at the tap like it is here in Texas a
pre<00:02:05.430> chiller<00:02:05.820> really<00:02:06.719> helps
