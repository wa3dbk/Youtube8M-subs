00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.680
 acz 

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.410
 yes 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.800
 yes 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.880
 hello how is this also 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.200
 I had 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.750
 the east according to millet fair where I will explain how they created to observe 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:38.800
 tibia 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.090
 so first of all we have to have three night careers 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:47.400
 and then it does not have to be that the icc study then 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.320
 downloads that this program 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.490
 but in this event 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.780
 or on the scene creation of servera 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.380
 do not use this program because I have this other in half 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.000
 this mixture 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.800
 the ps coveright study 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.460
 then to download the car reverte they are simply going to address 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.310
 the main page 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.310
 of our browser were going to place elmer server 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.910
 This is the forum where I belong and, the truth is, that is what 

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:21.110
 I recommend 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.210
 ishiÃ­ 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.990
 they want that they can register although 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.790
 I would really appreciate it if you registered 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.350
 then to subtract footpath and that they were simply clients 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.930
 they were going to accept the conditions 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.730
 and here they are going to ask 3 passed no more 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.550
 simply username, email address and password 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.420
 and click on register 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.420
 already being registered children are decorated 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240
 they were going to log in 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.300
 being disconnected we turn to benedetti cia 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.060
 they were going to look for the version they want 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.520
 in this case you must explain with a roberto car 8 points and 4 4 that I already have 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.899
 Discharged 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.899
 then after having the version 

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.819
 if you want is 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.139
 with this program that is that in those deficiencies they are taught 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.139
 then just be healthy 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:26.989
 the main page when they were going to place 

00:02:26.989 --> 00:02:28.759
 locke 

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:30.969
 come back here 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.349
 they were going to enter the first link 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.659
 and they are simply going to rebuild 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.659
 just news upload and download the program 

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:42.899
 for those who want with this one 

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:45.269
 programs are left behind with the psoe 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.909
 the little circle studies 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.399
 then they look for it in the forum 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:55.249
 then already having the milkman is simply we make take out our base 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:56.459
 of data 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.459
 we open the program 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.409
 and then we go 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:09.339
 believes that at least from databases 

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:11.159
 we explained how it was 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.629
 database 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.189
 in a report be the name you want in this case to place tutorial 

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:23.449
 were going to apply the second folder left here tomÃ¡s pÃ©rez esquivel 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:27.169
 and states that the observer 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.369
 then one being cashman oscar him 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:34.409
 forgotten server file 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.159
 that when he takes out 

00:03:36.159 --> 00:03:38.769
 i said we are passive 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:41.209
 and Christians again that they 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.069
 dt chemo our database here we can configure everything what they are 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.989
 accounts create you machetes then having this we do not go parents tour 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.989
 our servef folder and we go to with fluoride right foot 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.389
 after opening with 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.359
 the notes 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:03.409
 and if here where we are going to configure everything you see 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.009
 our observer 

00:04:05.009 --> 00:04:07.789
 percent example in the eat yesterday 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:09.229
 and so 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:14.729
 already you know tevez for those who do not know what is this one simply 

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:16.340
 they directed gaspar 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:19.340
 they were going to address aqualia the smi and pepe 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.019
 and click on the first link here 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.340
 so croc here 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.340
 after remembering that this was scola to preserve 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.260
 why do not I want to load the p 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.249
 so I thought we were sad 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.629
 chanelle measure 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.349
 percent observer man 

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.189
 in that is what one is what it is 

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:51.509
 and then from there comes if they want to buy min if they want 

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.340
 good that since these tests 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.979
 by the way he will go to 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.219
 at the last 

00:04:59.219 --> 00:05:02.020
 and it will look like a sad night 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.159
 status 

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:07.249
 for example here howard magic percent in it but the creator 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:12.009
 ema the power is not even the former PAN national president will place the 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:13.270
 page 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.020
 efe location 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.020
 in that case he placed colom labor that this chronicler explains or 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.250
 I close 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.339
 and I'm going to Christians and 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:25.870
 so 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.870
 We could hear or see 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:44.919
 and to know if the observer spends 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:50.180
 online 'then to the final where were men what is referred online 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.500
 then we will go to 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:56.500
 It is our server 

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:10.479
 good to send a shawl to Orion 

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:13.479
 percent the administrator of the forum 'el messi alves 

00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:16.900
 and for his ex-partner 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.900
 tell him that I'm in front with the forum has 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:22.900
 Well, the truth is that she is, I think, more than 2 100 

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.119
 registered users 

00:06:25.119 --> 00:06:28.229
 and wait I hope and that's why we wait 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:30.400
 the whole siena community wants to be 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.400
 have many many users 

00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:37.779
 and rockets to soria forward president of sitssa carry disgust 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:40.259
 simply 

00:06:40.259 --> 00:06:43.270
 You already know that you have to sign 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:44.809
 forced a month of beer 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:47.400
 then have logged in 

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.430
 With our 

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.080
 account in this case 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.080
 alcohol is one and peace gores puno 

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:57.729
 then we enter 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:00.919
 and then we finish the welcome message 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:02.469
 i the 

00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:05.469
 observe a few months ago we explain what 

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:08.300
 and we enter our charbel 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:09.710
 so 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.710
 rappel creates and attractively the account 

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:17.689
 min 

00:07:17.689 --> 00:07:20.689
 wench place 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:27.119
 this is all a very simple way to create night Alberto is 

00:07:27.119 --> 00:07:28.819
 For those who do not know 

00:07:28.819 --> 00:07:30.219
 in ee luis 

00:07:30.219 --> 00:07:31.300
 I was wrong 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.300
 in the passive 

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:37.740
 good in the end 

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.740
 well as you can see already of the terrors created 

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:45.699
 for a hundred thousand apologies for not having spoken for you because for not having 

00:07:45.699 --> 00:07:47.610
 taught how 

00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.289
 be for not showing them servera 

00:07:50.289 --> 00:07:52.689
 but how can I see it observed it has already been created 

00:07:52.689 --> 00:07:57.330
 and then it sounds less that's all and then yes according to gago or something 

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:00.590
 He simply commented on what I'll be waiting for to answer and you know 

00:08:01.099 --> 00:08:03.210
 this is my second tutorial 

00:08:03.210 --> 00:08:07.219
 the past was with some images but from what I see did not explode him much 

00:08:07.219 --> 00:08:10.219
 so that's why I decided to make a video tutorial 

00:08:10.719 --> 00:08:12.479
 and I hope it serves you well 

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:17.430
 so then comment and do not forget to rate the video 

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:18.050
 regards
