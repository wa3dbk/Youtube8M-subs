Boulder out after the the observation a

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.639 
Boulder out after the the observation a
new<00:01:13.119> atom<00:01:13.479> can<00:01:13.690> climb<00:01:13.899> it<00:01:14.080> for<00:01:14.229> sure

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
result this they knew well if atom

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.680 
result this they knew well if atom
flashes<00:01:21.369> it<00:01:21.520> I<00:01:21.550> only<00:01:21.849> have<00:01:22.030> one<00:01:22.240> more<00:01:22.420> try<00:01:22.630> so

to I would actually wanted to die know
the<00:01:31.840> next<00:01:32.050> move<00:01:32.259> but<00:01:32.560> once<00:01:32.739> I<00:01:32.860> came<00:01:32.890> there<00:01:33.250> are

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
the next move but once I came there are

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:34.529 
the next move but once I came there are
new<00:01:33.520> year<00:01:33.700> that's<00:01:33.910> impossible

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
new year that's impossible

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.139 
new year that's impossible

00:01:48.419 --> 00:01:48.429 
feel Alouettes hard looking as it were

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:50.400 
feel Alouettes hard looking as it were
all<00:01:48.729> or<00:01:49.060> just<00:01:49.360> the<00:01:49.690> cream<00:01:49.899> always<00:01:50.050> rises<00:01:50.170> to
