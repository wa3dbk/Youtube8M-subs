00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.310
 welcome to a presentation from the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.720
 player here at the apparatus presentation is 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.780
 not quite correct it's more of a 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.309
 script presentation what to use and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.440
 Of course , this is what we know 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.560
 can be convinced now and here 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.640
 the drive control yes, you are right 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.810
 you; that the long 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.300
 decided and why did that 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:27.300
 video because an update came out and that v 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.880
 3.61 that includes a new module and 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.009
 Although I camera module I show times 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.120
 in short what does a direct effect 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:39.180
 compare that in small picture worth now 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.340
 equal to the original position with 1 value 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.890
 So 1 sees all values ​​set to one 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.890
 and now it looks like that with me 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.780
 and them the same 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.730
 yes that was the direct comparison and 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.190
 many Kenya's single-shot camera fashion 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.960
 from upside down 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.910
 the case now became practical 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.440
 because this is just as a module 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:13.700
 is implemented in the drive control short 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:16.010
 Explanation on top of that is easy 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.180
 can now more accurately so the factors 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:20.300
 adjust exactly 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.940
 just for me as a controller player 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:26.440
 very cool and very important because with 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.880
 facts you have seen it in comparison 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.610
 dre so you have to almost head 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:34.100
 backwards we crank that you too 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.470
 describes beautifully and that is tedious 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.479
 especially if you have a tractor like this and now 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.250
 change of direction so look 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.140
 must change direction if 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.220
 It is very nice to drive in the nose 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:48.470
 very stressful times it is so what is 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.450
 Although new is indeed and indeed this is 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.910
 function here so camera itself this 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.619
 temporally if I have one now 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:57.860
 changing okay so that really again 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:00.260
 outward while keeping under correct 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.530
 the position at that is a small one 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:07.810
 additional function which one, however, if 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.810
 can turn off if not satisfied 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.060
 how this works is easy 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.489
 the description of the link to download 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.060
 is in my video description 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.400
 available 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:23.420
 just read that by it really 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:27.980
 understandable and can each self 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.660
 We want to adjust to our factor 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.150
 attitude still I took over 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:35.750
 What's upside down in his description 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.820
 recommends and that is again 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.160
 the same values ​​increase again for 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:46.190
 all the already used the cameraman 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:48.470
 have just on factor 3 so in the sense 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.480
 we are already by and would like 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.760
 Thank you for turning on if you 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.980
 liked not forget to thumb 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.010
 above i like button may blog 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.410
 that makes me happy and honors my none 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.770
 wanted to fit more videos 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.440
 Of course, an abo 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:09.720
 but I only notice 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:15.040
 also swings with the terrain 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:17.440
 that I am if I mean that too 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:21.520
 please notice comments i would like 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:25.330
 know if I am mistaken here now or if 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:29.610
 that's really how it is then its many 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.610
 thanks for being up again first ciao
