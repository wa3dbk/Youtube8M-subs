00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.450
 since the first manufacture of 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.059
 Cheese the cheese makers have been looking for 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.980
 the ideal coagulant throughout the 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:17.890
 years have developed different 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.660
 types of coagulants if max m is the most 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.270
 recent and today the tool 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.940
 more effective for the modern cheesemaker 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:26.980
 chr hansen proudly presents chi max 

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:29.859
 m the second generation of chymosin 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.359
 produced by fermentation which acts 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:34.090
 better than any other kind of 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.680
 coagulant so that yes max m is a 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.449
 of the most effective tools to 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.670
 layout of the cheese maker 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.199
 modern looking for ways to optimize the 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.420
 production costs and at the same time 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.180
 preserve an excellent flavor in cheese 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.729
 the coagulant liquid appears 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.820
 which after being diluted can be added with 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:53.769
 ease in milk once if max m 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.729
 is in the milk is combined with the 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.729
 other components 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.840
 the main components of milk 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.840
 they are fat globules 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.730
 casein michelle ace 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.880
 and other components such as lactose 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:16.310
 whey and mineral proteins 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:19.130
 a miserable casein consists of a 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.039
 alpha nucleus and beta casein and a 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.770
 rough surface of casein layer in the 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:27.470
 milk if max m interacts quickly 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.450
 with the casein misers in particular 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.909
 the coagulant separates small fractions 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.520
 of peptides called glick or macro 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.310
 peptides of the miguelas this stage is 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.280
 normally called phase 1 of the process 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.009
 of coagulation unlike others 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:46.159
 coagulants chemax m does not harm the core 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.099
 of the casein micelle if max m alone 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.259
 cut the casein layer this is the reason 

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:53.539
 why if max m improves the 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.209
 cheese yield and also reduces the 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.729
 bitterness in the cheese the main advantage 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:00.950
 of chemax m is that it only cuts the layer 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.679
 casein and not other parts of the micelle 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.869
 it is known that other coagulants less 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.360
 advanced break components also 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.729
 from the core of the micelle this is not 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.690
 desirable for the cheese maker and 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.819
 that some of these products 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.910
 resulting from the breakdown of peptides 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:19.130
 will give a bitter taste others will be lost 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.120
 in the serum and will result in a loss 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.549
 significant performance 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.790
 when separating the lic or macro peptides from 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:28.830
 the casein micelle the micelle becomes 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.959
 unstable and binds with other micelles 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.920
 unstable forming a network 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.920
 three-dimensional 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.870
 this is known as phase 2 of the process 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.820
 of coagulation where the liquid milk is 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.710
 turns into a firmer substance 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:47.010
 that can be cut into curd from 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.890
 cheese if max m is suitable for everything 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.050
 type of cheeses use chemax m in the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.090
 cheese making provides a 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.430
 higher performance which reduces the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.890
 production costs in the plant if max 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.710
 m also gives the cheese a flavor 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.440
 clean and less bitter 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.260
 coagulant offers a higher serum 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.930
 that produces the purest serum finally 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.380
 if max m is kosher alan and suitable for 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.380
 vegetarians
