instruments have wrists just like our

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.560 
instruments have wrists just like our
own<00:01:48.920> hand<00:01:49.250> so<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:49.640> they<00:01:49.760> can<00:01:49.940> move<00:01:50.119> in<00:01:50.360> all

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
own hand so that they can move in all

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.450 
own hand so that they can move in all
directions<00:01:50.720> they<00:01:51.470> have<00:01:51.619> all<00:01:51.860> of<00:01:51.979> that<00:01:52.010> what's

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
directions they have all of that what's

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.340 
directions they have all of that what's
called<00:01:52.700> the<00:01:52.880> degrees<00:01:53.299> of<00:01:53.330> freedom<00:01:53.869> of<00:01:53.960> a<00:01:54.049> human

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
called the degrees of freedom of a human

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.899 
called the degrees of freedom of a human
hand<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.340> it<00:01:55.580> gives<00:01:55.970> the<00:01:56.240> surgeon<00:01:56.659> much<00:01:56.900> more

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
hand so it gives the surgeon much more

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.570 
hand so it gives the surgeon much more
flexibility<00:01:58.909> and<00:01:59.150> and<00:01:59.979> accuracy<00:02:00.979> in<00:02:01.130> terms<00:02:01.369> of

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
flexibility and and accuracy in terms of

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.440 
flexibility and and accuracy in terms of
movement<00:02:02.350> secondly<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:04.450> conventional

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
movement secondly the conventional

laparoscopy<00:02:06.200> is<00:02:06.350> done<00:02:06.590> with<00:02:06.770> two-dimensional

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
laparoscopy is done with two-dimensional

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.550 
laparoscopy is done with two-dimensional
viewing<00:02:08.420> so<00:02:08.689> like<00:02:08.840> when<00:02:08.989> you<00:02:09.049> go<00:02:09.170> to<00:02:09.200> a<00:02:09.319> movie

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
viewing so like when you go to a movie

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.230 
viewing so like when you go to a movie
theater<00:02:09.709> and<00:02:10.009> you're<00:02:10.160> watching<00:02:10.280> movie<00:02:10.729> it's

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:11.240 
theater and you're watching movie it's

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.330 
theater and you're watching movie it's
in<00:02:11.450> 2d<00:02:11.870> you<00:02:12.050> don't<00:02:12.290> really<00:02:12.470> get<00:02:12.740> a<00:02:12.800> sense<00:02:13.130> of

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
in 2d you don't really get a sense of

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.620 
in 2d you don't really get a sense of
depth

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
depth

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.500 
depth
with<00:02:14.810> the<00:02:15.050> robot<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:16.280> surgeon<00:02:16.820> is<00:02:16.940> working<00:02:17.390> in

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
with the robot the surgeon is working in

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.330 
with the robot the surgeon is working in
a<00:02:17.600> three<00:02:17.870> dimensional<00:02:17.900> environment<00:02:18.530> so<00:02:19.190> it's

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
a three dimensional environment so it's

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.670 
a three dimensional environment so it's
like<00:02:19.460> going<00:02:19.700> to<00:02:19.730> a<00:02:19.850> 3d<00:02:20.240> movie<00:02:20.450> so<00:02:20.780> you<00:02:20.840> have<00:02:21.140> the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
like going to a 3d movie so you have the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.940 
like going to a 3d movie so you have the
added<00:02:22.330> benefits<00:02:23.330> visually<00:02:23.900> of<00:02:24.080> having<00:02:24.590> depth

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
added benefits visually of having depth

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.890 
added benefits visually of having depth
perception<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.760> that<00:02:26.240> of<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.690> of<00:02:26.870> course

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
perception and that of that of course

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.890 
perception and that of that of course
lends<00:02:27.380> much<00:02:27.680> more<00:02:27.920> accuracy<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:29.630> what<00:02:29.810> the

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
lends much more accuracy to what the

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.980 
lends much more accuracy to what the
surgeon<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.380> doing<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.980> and<00:02:31.520> also<00:02:31.850> a<00:02:32.480> much

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
surgeon is doing and and also a much

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.260 
surgeon is doing and and also a much
more<00:02:33.020> detailed<00:02:33.380> picture<00:02:34.070> of<00:02:34.100> what<00:02:34.610> what's

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
more detailed picture of what what's

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.170 
more detailed picture of what what's
going<00:02:35.570> on<00:02:35.720> I<00:02:35.930> wasn't<00:02:36.920> cut<00:02:37.190> from<00:02:37.760> top<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:37.970> bottom

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
going on I wasn't cut from top to bottom

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.970 
going on I wasn't cut from top to bottom
or<00:02:38.420> anything<00:02:38.720> like<00:02:38.840> that<00:02:38.870> at<00:02:39.170> all<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.530> I<00:02:39.830> was

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
or anything like that at all and I was

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.340 
or anything like that at all and I was
up<00:02:40.520> and<00:02:40.700> walking<00:02:40.790> around<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.420> next<00:02:41.720> day<00:02:41.750> if

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
up and walking around the next day if

up and walking around the next day if
you've<00:02:42.590> got<00:02:42.740> to<00:02:42.830> have<00:02:42.980> cancer<00:02:43.460> this<00:02:43.640> was

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
you've got to have cancer this was

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.310 
you've got to have cancer this was
probably<00:02:44.210> the<00:02:44.390> best<00:02:44.510> experience<00:02:44.720> you<00:02:45.200> could

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
probably the best experience you could

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.800 
probably the best experience you could
have<00:02:45.500> and<00:02:46.310> to<00:02:46.640> have<00:02:46.790> somebody<00:02:47.000> like<00:02:47.240> dr.<00:02:47.480> Ryder
