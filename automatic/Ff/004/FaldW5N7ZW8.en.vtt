00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 I really like Japanese culture and 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.870
 I really appreciate the Japanese but 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.220
 Can you do this? 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.559
 well if you are watching this video it is 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.360
 Why have you ever tried to open your fists? 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.280
 understand will try to open your fists 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.049
 intention to show some shortcuts to 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.300
 you open the super nintendo without having to 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.650
 buy a key game bits good if you 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.810
 does not have much patience to do 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.070
 gambiarra and I have some work 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.570
 arduous 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.980
 I recommend you directly on the internet 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.199
 buy the key to issue I had this 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.329
 Key unfaithful fucking in thousand 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.920
 the first cheap alternative you 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.350
 finds neither legs of fable and super 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.050
 nintendo is the bic pen is very simple 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.210
 Are you going to use a bic pen tube going 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.610
 warm the tip of this tube with 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.430
 plastic already very hot you will put 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:54.750
 straight into the super nintendo screw that 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:57.360
 will happen it will shape with the tip 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.730
 very hot and the plastic melted it goes 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.280
 molding the head of the screw and will 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.559
 wait a few moments until the tube 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.420
 is free and then you will run if you 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.090
 You're lucky you can get the 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.310
 alternative circuit bolt did not 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.189
 Okay, you can try this Monday here. 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.060
 O that the screwdriver carved by 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.720
 a file 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.880
 basically you will get your key 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.900
 and will make a hole here in the 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.290
 halfway until this hole snaps into the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.750
 bolt more or less so there are 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.210
 options other than the pen in the 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.549
 screwdriver on the internet say they 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.229
 you have a key that earns 4 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.390
 you can open the 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.220
 screw that it seems that the entrance of the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.689
 key does not fit very well and you 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.210
 You need an animated one too. 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.979
 I do not know how to 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.259
 is that I did not invent this option 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.600
 Alternatively, you can use this 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.810
 little key that I do not remember the name and here 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:59.399
 right here in the middle here you use a 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.990
 Tongue a saw and carve a key. 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.420
 game beach as if it were a key to 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:07.259
 issue you will make four holes and 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.090
 that one so one one so and two in the 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.039
 diagonal or if none of these 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.530
 Alternative worked then it is because the 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.860
 bolt must have spied it is my 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.200
 case 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.000
 good this situation is the worst of all 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.370
 because you can not open with 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.100
 no key there is a kit an extractor 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.560
 screws that they especially use 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.440
 Screw terraces that are or are not 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:32.310
 head but I do not know if it has exactly 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.730
 the size of this drill that's a 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.130
 he drilled the bolt and there he has 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.350
 a worldwide scheme there that takes understood 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.940
 I do not know if it has the size of the par was 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.610
 use of super nintendo 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.410
 I tried two options for April the 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.209
 superintendent who has screw 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.370
 Dusted you, you're a guy who has a 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.300
 very great affection for your super 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.310
 nintendo 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.160
 I think you will not be able to take away 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.340
 these screws because it involves 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.540
 basically ruin the entrances of the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.070
 screw 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.480
 good I have here my super nintendo 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.220
 baby model 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.790
 What are you going to do? You can use a 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.100
 drill or is a hot screwdriver 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.110
 I'll explain the two ways to the middle 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:15.360
 with the phrase you 're going to make a hole in 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.580
 back of the screw will break when 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.280
 you do that you break the plastic 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.110
 so screw no longer has the goal 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.840
 he the same thing will do with the key 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:27.660
 you will warm it and 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.340
 will stick around the bolt 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.820
 plastic and will happen more or less 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.820
 this here 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:42.100
 the screws will get stuck here in the 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.130
 video game 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.320
 and then with some kind of pliers the other 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.500
 thing can be significant beak 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.990
 thin you can take the screw 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.870
 This is a very important tip if you 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.720
 in any of the ways and methods 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.240
 I happened to get the screw 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.280
 throw away that cap screw from the 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:04.930
 hell do not try to put it back 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.490
 because surely this screw will 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.410
 spread and then you will have to do 

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:11.170
 said he then replaced the screws 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.820
 by philips screws or defend it 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.250
 And now you ask me how I 

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.850
 I do when we arrive he tries everything 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.799
 spoiled cardigan all means to this method 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.560
 which is going to stick only around the 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:25.570
 screw will not pick up any 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.430
 something that can ruin the super 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.890
 nintendo for you to close after you 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.169
 You can use hot glue you can get a 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.900
 screw and you can put link in the 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:40.740
 and then you throw hot glue on 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:43.360
 around him and he fashioned again a good 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.250
 these were my alternatives to 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.820
 open a super nintendo if you have 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:50.860
 other methods other ways there 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.390
