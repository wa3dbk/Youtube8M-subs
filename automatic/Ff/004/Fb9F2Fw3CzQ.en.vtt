00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
 I had the opportunity to see I was encouraged 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:09.710
 see the end of serbia of the world a 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.710
 little 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.270
 we're just passing it on a channel and 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.460
 ticket section and fulfilled nothing 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.939
 it was last year and suddenly I see 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:28.859
 the tray of hugo chÃ¡vez that goes in the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:31.109
 fever that I got from 700 to 700 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.570
 technicians supen the match and two shots 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.570
 that determine 374 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.210
 Russia 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:47.300
 I against intermediation that wants 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.960
 defend it but all of the Russian that 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.850
 finish the plot but as a team 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.180
 general is still here we play so much 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.850
 best 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.810
 what he did defend a little bit was much more 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.810
 young is much more energetic 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.520
 and we put more reactions to it 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.270
 we were playing we were 10 players we played 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.270
 all 25 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:22.310
 the children with the ball with aritos and 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:25.200
 still buy them a habit but 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.390
 they started walking I would tell you 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:33.640
 and they made a match if you leave it 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.430
 Now that now wait watch the suspenders 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.850
 the grandfather and the uncles 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:39.850
 no no no 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.520
 that is with animals and those things 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.880
 and those things 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.450
 but I also fell a little water 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.670
 the pike forwards likes the ball 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.539
 if you come here there is a little country 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.330
 little walk 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:10.500

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:15.660
 they are to the limit that we have the wings 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.580
 and they stay watching movies there the turn 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.670
 what they did in Argentina what 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.710
 I enjoyed that Julia really understood what 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.560
 I did what I did until this 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:28.320
 moment until that I think it was very 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.190
 little when when they lived the 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.190
 sterility 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.810
 and they do not understand it 's normal that I what 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.340
 daddy fucks the sea they take it in a 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.930
 moment as it is the enemy of 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.450
 power 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.340

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.120

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.120
 and read in lately 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:07.460

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:46.530
 that about 50 in the car was going to be a 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.030
 kind of radio listens people to talk so much 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.680

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.160

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:06.159
 Y 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.159
 everything had a market but that way 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.250
 Y 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.250

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.290
 I would also be no no to the mind 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.290
 I personally too but it was 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:32.630
 the control movie I have a bar for 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.550
 recommending you was totally nothing 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.010
 I went to the movies twice and have two 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:41.670
 comedies of cross but the guys give 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.150

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.490
 pinter bread 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:49.270
 the biggest do things I have all of them 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:52.020
 memory but without the now what 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.020
 would be 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:06.260
 the journalistic subject I'm going to learn a 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:09.230
 season are 12 episodes and a trip 

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:11.780
 you going to do or would like to make 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:14.180
 Novaro place more than the place you have 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:16.430
 how to say this the framework that I have to 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.870
 go been like this there are products that I have not 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.820
 soon I will not be able to put 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.080
 is more severe weather kenya and tanzania 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.990
 and with your children 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:27.700
 ideally comicio 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.790
 I would love to 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:33.670
 when looking at home 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.490
 can not shoot at anything 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:39.090
 but I would love to sing the northeast 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.090
 Australian 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:48.920
 but I have for us 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.920
 the father 

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:54.630
 Australian 

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.630
 in the zone 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:03.810
 manatee turtles and the proto would love 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:03.810
 go visit him 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.900
 deep that you regret 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:16.129
 in decisions 

00:06:19.249 --> 00:06:23.460
 obviously 

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:25.560
 maybe some almost saying that 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:27.830
 said he did not have thrown some passes 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.830
 much 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.240
 but one learns according to him 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.060
 16 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:47.330
 but it can not be other than what 

00:06:42.749 --> 00:06:50.330
 staff approximately more than 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.330
 regret 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.210
 bad things 

00:06:55.830 --> 00:07:04.110
 I do not have anything 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:07.310
 you have one that you think I'm going to have 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.310
 of suspenders 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:14.509
 to pass it and keep it thrown away 

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.850
 from the guy who told me to 

00:07:18.390 --> 00:07:24.300
 nothing could take the ball to me 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:26.730
 leaving it in places has gone great but 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.500
 it is clear but neither is something I come 

00:07:26.730 --> 00:07:30.040
 so material that if you put the one of grabbed 

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.740
 a new ball there 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:33.479
 I think I can 

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:35.930
 I have the age burn the more 

00:07:33.479 --> 00:07:35.930
 I remember here 

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.080
 can show us
