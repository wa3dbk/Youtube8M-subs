00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.540
 a 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.040
 yes construction video the way you can't 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.040
 see about the fifa 14 do and ps3 cup 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.949
 league cup what I'm going to do and that's it 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.480
 certainly not the name of the doesn't matter 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.730
 as you know I already had 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.840
 announced in an angry heart of nevertheless 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.430
 yes i will do that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.689
 immediately away quite and comfort spent really 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.810
 nice to see you all that 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.760
 so eager to participate 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.669
 but of course not everyone can 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.260
 participate I have found 8 men with one 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.890
 7 men every six months because I know myself 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.420
 in elgato her pair pvr roxio that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.170
 means that there are 8 men who 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.000
 can boom ears 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.100
 so eight matches are going tomorrow 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.950
 plays so that there are still eight free 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.480
 places are these 8 5 places go 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.760
 of course to sups because that's for it 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.100
 the tournament 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.649
 yes those 8 tips that are lucky but for 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.690
 that you are still some of eco an economist 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.730
 a are a number of things here 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.590
 have one you have to have 20 that's one 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.600
 pretty important to all competitions 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.180
 is say you have to plan with you 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.250
 opponent imagine you are coming against me 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.080
 then you just have to go to my twitter then 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.909
 I follow you add me one moment 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.900
 dm then the message we agree 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.100
 when we are going to play that match 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.119
 because of course that must be 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.560
 agreed 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.869
 because not everyone can always and that 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.790
 I also understand you have only say 2 or 3 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.950
 days to play with you and 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.900
 preferably as soon as possible of course 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.869
 it cannot be otherwise it cannot be otherwise 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.439
 you should then you also suspended for games 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.439
 are shaking 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.049
 just turn you off then you 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.140
 opponent 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.460
 we approach or he invites you via 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.829
 twitter and then you need the brand 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.850
 so firstly twitter must 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:49.320
 secondly, have a registration fee for the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.040
 yes for you say for the eight 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.990
 people is 15k so far must have 15k on 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.399
 it because otherwise you can not participate 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.380
 and then you think why well that's nice 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.229
 the winner no negative quay number 2 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.469
 gets 20k so it is all together 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:08.759
 price 110 channel as 8 man 15 kg even 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:11.039
 quickly calculated is 120 canoe 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.490
 I give then 110 is away I do n't know with 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.709
 error saima 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.250
 I look around that 8 man room 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.740
 all of which give 15k is 120k then it goes 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.110
 at or nine that kana the winner and 20k 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.250
 to the number 2 the 610 issued to 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.510
 the other 10k 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.510
 I don't love them myself because they are 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.130
 all absorbed in that etex he who 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.690
 five percent in the say goes off 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.600
 always I don't need anything about getting married 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.760
 because as soon as I place him places 4 co 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.000
 I start all over again with one 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.290
 very new account so yes it has anyway 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
 no sense to me to keep points 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.510
 if x isn't about a few things 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.680
 need more so the winner wins 90k 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.550
 the number 22 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.800
 and yes everyone who oh man so along 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.239
 may do must have 15k bet that must 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.100
 First full pay chantal I him 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.530
 So join the things that to you 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.360
 must have is 20 follow the matches 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.390
 say and meet 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.550
 15k if registration fee must be above the rest 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.260
 have your ff team but I think that is 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.269
 makes sense if your fifa ultimate team 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.280
 tournament 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:13.930
 So those two things you must have before 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.620
 the rest basically down viewers 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:19.150
 skype app might be fun as that one 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:21.130
 if your mind has a say with you 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.780
 we all communicate but that is 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.500
 no need to say so just 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.989
 twitter and and and actually earn and 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.760
 You have to pay me 15k and 15k 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:33.489
 so that goes also via twitter 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.470
 Approach it all eight 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.630
 man who can participate and they have to 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.590
 15k after a special side of me left 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.690
 to make 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.200
 just don't come upstairs to find you 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:43.540
 nice 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.989
 the other grandmother I will arrange that 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:49.510
 and so if you want to participate put one 

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:52.810
 description this is my ps and this is 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.310
 my twitter and i have 15k so i 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.090
 sure you have 15k 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.400
 because some people have 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.690
 probably already in the description 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.579
 for our to spam but you need a de 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.260
 seven say I have 15k the I know for sure 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.340
 that 's what it looked like on this piece 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.220
 But then it would certainly be everything 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.329
 just yes and then you have that match 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.829
 we will still do that within three days 

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:10.540
 try to play 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.430
 all matches next horror string I'm going 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.100
 I got that 8 first match because in the first 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.550
 be round 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.320
 or with you there I always make 

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:20.360
 yes i am 4 episode then help 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.480
 episode 2 manager 

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.830
 and then there are 8 people left over me 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.630
 hope all four of them with one game 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.630
 continue capture all stars is up 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:31.760
 basket but I think that will happen 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.020
 and then in advance a bit and also 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.000
 not if you won who would form 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.070
 adversary because already I kill 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.590
 again because suppose there are two 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:41.720
 gamecapture lanes come together and two 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.830
 not thing caps teka means that one 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.720
 that kind of two sides 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.850
 included in match not next to the 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.410
 trick so meaningless as white chicago 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.510
 that both the matching game capture 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.710
 just a game capture so that all at the 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:54.350
 match live 

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:56.930
 grigor so I leave the first round 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.190
 you see as soon as all t's tan or all 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:59.870
 the eight 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.140
 lucky ones who will just choose randomly 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.500
 then just do it randomly first 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:08.360
 as soon as those 8 are known I will leave the 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.650
 see eight first matches against whom 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.080
 would meet and then if 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.630
 played in all eight games 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.760
 then there remains agnes over mouth we 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:21.440
 start with 16 stupid hearts and those four 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.520
 lacquer competitions therefore again do not see 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.960
 against who that is 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.420
 then those four games come 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.890
 so four men are also remaining 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.810
 then that is scheduled again and two 

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:31.340
 matches that allow two matches 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:32.840
 so we can stay two 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:34.010
 men may that is the final in the 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.480
 last match to let that cook 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:37.430
 zenith very beautiful 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.620
 the point is the winne look at 120 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.350
 catus 15k registration fee and you have to 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.000
 have whiter so say everyone 

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:45.410
 who wants to participate and who knows 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.340
 project to the eight happy I am going 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:51.530
 run choose yes that I vlog so that 

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:53.030
 you see that it is fair and then too 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:55.160
 that you all want to participate 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:56.780
 also give you like you so that more people 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.880
 of this tournament know part but 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.590
 possibly via twitter when in the course 

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:01.760
 I don't care 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.620
 would be very nice if you want to do that 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:05.620
 thanks for watching and number of people
