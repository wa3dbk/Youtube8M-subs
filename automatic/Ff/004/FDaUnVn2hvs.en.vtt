runescape private server right first go
to<00:00:08.370> your<00:00:08.550> server<00:00:09.420> sauce<00:00:09.740> I'm<00:00:10.740> using<00:00:10.980> vintage

to your server sauce I'm using vintage

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.650 
to your server sauce I'm using vintage
because<00:00:11.759> it's<00:00:12.120> quite<00:00:12.360> simple<00:00:12.920> so<00:00:13.920> just<00:00:14.130> go<00:00:14.309> to

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
because it's quite simple so just go to

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.420 
because it's quite simple so just go to
configuration<00:00:16.609> open<00:00:17.609> up<00:00:18.710> MPC<00:00:19.710> drops<00:00:20.010> if<00:00:20.310> you

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
configuration open up MPC drops if you

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.920 
configuration open up MPC drops if you
should<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:21.119> one<00:00:21.800> go<00:00:22.800> down<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.220> bottom

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
should have one go down to the bottom

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.740 
should have one go down to the bottom
just<00:00:25.939> new<00:00:26.939> bit<00:00:27.180> them<00:00:27.890> right<00:00:28.890> so<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.670> can<00:00:29.970> have

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
just new bit them right so you can have

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.720 
just new bit them right so you can have
new<00:00:30.990> different<00:00:31.470> sections<00:00:31.949> to<00:00:32.160> say<00:00:32.340> you<00:00:32.399> want

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
new different sections to say you want

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.950 
new different sections to say you want
to<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.480> know<00:00:34.320> for<00:00:34.350> example<00:00:35.239> kbd<00:00:36.239> just<00:00:36.750> put

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
to do I know for example kbd just put

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.389 
to do I know for example kbd just put
kbd<00:00:37.879> go<00:00:38.879> down<00:00:39.170> MPC<00:00:40.170> drop<00:00:40.530> just<00:00:40.860> tighten<00:00:41.219> that

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
kbd go down MPC drop just tighten that

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.670 
kbd go down MPC drop just tighten that
theme<00:00:42.149> tab<00:00:43.190> equal<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.489> space<00:00:44.670> say<00:00:45.539> no<00:00:46.350> no<00:00:46.410> no

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
theme tab equal to space say no no no

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.930 
theme tab equal to space say no no no
just<00:00:47.450> that<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.920> then<00:00:49.920> this<00:00:50.070> is<00:00:50.250> what<00:00:50.399> item

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
just that and then this is what item

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.569 
just that and then this is what item
that<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.750> want<00:00:51.780> it<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.170> drop<00:00:52.410> so<00:00:52.649> you<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:52.949> 995

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
that you want it to drop so you see 995

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.889 
that you want it to drop so you see 995
that's<00:00:53.879> coins<00:00:55.039> have<00:00:57.050> how<00:00:58.050> many<00:00:59.570> what<00:01:00.570> amount

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
that's coins have how many what amount

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.539 
that's coins have how many what amount
so<00:01:01.289> say<00:01:01.800> eighty<00:01:02.640> thousand<00:01:03.329> coins<00:01:04.339> then<00:01:05.339> this

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
so say eighty thousand coins then this

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.219 
so say eighty thousand coins then this
is<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.729> percentage<00:01:06.299> see<00:01:06.600> a<00:01:06.630> hundred<00:01:07.020> scene

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
is the percentage see a hundred scene

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.950 
is the percentage see a hundred scene
that's<00:01:07.439> every<00:01:07.799> single<00:01:08.130> drop<00:01:08.960> ninety-nine

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
that's every single drop ninety-nine

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.620 
that's every single drop ninety-nine
percent<00:01:10.110> this<00:01:10.520> basically<00:01:11.520> every<00:01:11.850> drop<00:01:12.090> one

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
percent this basically every drop one

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.450 
percent this basically every drop one
person<00:01:12.990> it's<00:01:13.200> the<00:01:13.320> most<00:01:13.530> real<00:01:14.479> very<00:01:15.479> rare<00:01:15.689> drop

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
person it's the most real very rare drop

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:23.719 
person it's the most real very rare drop
to<00:01:17.460> its<00:01:17.790> rear<00:01:18.180> ten<00:01:19.880> uncommon<00:01:21.170> 50<00:01:22.170> often<00:01:22.950> common

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
to its rear ten uncommon 50 often common

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.010 
to its rear ten uncommon 50 often common
so<00:01:24.060> 30<00:01:24.900> about<00:01:25.740> average<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.460> know<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:27.020> so

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
so 30 about average you know just so

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.649 
so 30 about average you know just so
just<00:01:28.200> stuff<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.619> it<00:01:28.680> so<00:01:29.670> say<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.939> do<00:01:30.470> ATK<00:01:31.470> 100<00:01:32.659> so

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
just stuff I it so say I do ATK 100 so

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.010 
just stuff I it so say I do ATK 100 so
just<00:01:33.930> like<00:01:34.049> that<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:35.329> obviously<00:01:36.329> you

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
just like that and then obviously you

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.719 
just like that and then obviously you
could<00:01:37.460> so<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.700> when<00:01:39.240> you<00:01:39.360> go<00:01:39.479> kill<00:01:39.720> kbd<00:01:40.729> you'll

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
could so see when you go kill kbd you'll

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.760 
could so see when you go kill kbd you'll
drop<00:01:42.619> coins<00:01:43.619> ATK<00:01:44.930> every<00:01:45.930> single<00:01:46.290> time<00:01:46.740> you

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
drop coins ATK every single time you

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.190 
drop coins ATK every single time you
kill<00:01:47.040> them<00:01:47.299> so<00:01:48.299> just<00:01:48.540> like<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.720> say<00:01:49.140> you

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200
