00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:17.369
 who needs the game'm sure life 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.859
 here testing smash bros 3gs some 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.470
 The ways we have here at the fair are 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.570
 the modes stirs and stirs lan 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.570
 Let's start that by modus mexico 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.380
 Let's get my favorite, right? 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:36.070
 Let's get the link tone. 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.590
 let's start any scenario the scenario 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.880
 so let's see that the commands still 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:44.530
 I did not play 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:47.700
 It will be my first time to brake 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.700
 bomb then come on 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.780
 So 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:01:00.110
 the game is very cool here on the screen has 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.870
 fewer buttons have than the one who threw the version 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:06.200
 the quiet LRTI right 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.610
 so some buttons here wanted to push 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.610
 with a little more calm opa 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.880
 ox or y jump then there is not so much 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.620
 need so particular starting 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.480
 up 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.440
 the kiss to continue to do the same 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.870
 functions on the console one oops 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.979
 little star that barely catches 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:33.550
 We have the strike here on the button. 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:38.200
 Someone here ended up pulling him 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:41.430
 eating away lined loose another 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.530
 link is a little weak I found more 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.150
 but it is zero anyway the step 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.590
 initial 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.590
 no no 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.720
 Mario almost died there trying to get me 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.810
 we are trying the case here 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:06.120
 the case goes out chasing the screen 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.420
 the software already because I ended up losing 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.420
 on here 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.990
 Let's try and knock somebody else down. 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.690
 It's kinda weird to be here in 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:24.540
 up is a bit difficult to pick up from 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.129
 skip this book and dodge 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:31.799
 for those who have the custom said that vanunu 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:32.730
 l but it's still cool here giving 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:35.010
 stuck 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.459
 The father has to make a new brush. 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.459
 I got 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.870
 the screen is much worse it is even in xl until a 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:47.580
 little bit to play for all 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:50.300
 santa is happening on the screen but without 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:53.180
 doubts it stirs 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.740
 so this was the multiplayer mode here 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.740
 dancing in death 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.830
 and that's what we see here 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.410
 this is the next module we make a 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.990
 other video 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:20.240
 even because competing here 3ds worth 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.240
 by the audience and the next step
