00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.290 

in<00:00:10.320> this<00:00:10.559> tutorial<00:00:10.769> I<00:00:11.250> want<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.580> discuss<00:00:11.940> the

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
in this tutorial I want to discuss the

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.250 
in this tutorial I want to discuss the
workflow<00:00:12.900> between<00:00:13.170> Kronos<00:00:13.889> sculpt<00:00:14.280> and<00:00:14.429> moto

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:15.260 
workflow between Kronos sculpt and moto

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.750 
workflow between Kronos sculpt and moto
now<00:00:16.260> in<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> previous<00:00:16.920> tutorial<00:00:17.490> with

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
now in the previous tutorial with

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.240 
now in the previous tutorial with
workflow<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.390> interchange<00:00:18.779> between<00:00:18.930> Maya<00:00:19.439> we

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
workflow and interchange between Maya we

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.370 
workflow and interchange between Maya we
started<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.820> Lightwave<00:00:21.240> first<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:22.140> get<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
started in Lightwave first to get the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.259 
started in Lightwave first to get the
motion<00:00:22.710> data<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.220> then<00:00:23.609> came<00:00:23.880> in<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.090> chrono

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
motion data and then came in to chrono

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.420 
motion data and then came in to chrono
sculpt<00:00:24.630> but<00:00:25.439> since<00:00:25.769> chrono<00:00:25.980> sculpt<00:00:26.340> is

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
sculpt but since chrono sculpt is

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.250 
sculpt but since chrono sculpt is
actually<00:00:26.789> a<00:00:26.820> standalone<00:00:27.300> application<00:00:27.570> we

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
actually a standalone application we

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.109 
actually a standalone application we
don't<00:00:28.410> have<00:00:28.650> to<00:00:28.830> start<00:00:29.070> in<00:00:29.189> Lightwave<00:00:29.550> we

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
don't have to start in Lightwave we

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.590 
don't have to start in Lightwave we
could<00:00:30.269> actually<00:00:30.420> import<00:00:31.109> an<00:00:31.320> obj<00:00:31.830> FBX<00:00:32.600> LWO

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
could actually import an obj FBX LWO

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.900 
could actually import an obj FBX LWO
straight<00:00:34.559> into<00:00:34.800> Chronos<00:00:35.070> sculpt<00:00:35.370> and<00:00:35.489> start

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
straight into Chronos sculpt and start

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.720 
straight into Chronos sculpt and start
with<00:00:36.210> no<00:00:36.600> cache<00:00:36.840> file<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.160> you<00:00:38.219> see<00:00:38.399> now<00:00:38.550> if

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
with no cache file so as you see now if

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.869 
with no cache file so as you see now if
I<00:00:38.850> scrub<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.120> timeline<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:40.550> splash<00:00:41.550> it

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
I scrub the timeline this splash it

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.580 
I scrub the timeline this splash it
could<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.180> water<00:00:42.450> splash<00:00:42.809> or<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.170> paint

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
could be a water splash or a paint

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.190 
could be a water splash or a paint
spider<00:00:43.860> has<00:00:44.430> no<00:00:44.760> animation<00:00:45.120> on<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.390> we're

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
spider has no animation on it we're

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.560 
spider has no animation on it we're
going<00:00:46.410> to<00:00:46.590> create<00:00:47.010> that<00:00:47.100> animation<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:48.000> Corona

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
going to create that animation in Corona

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.590 
going to create that animation in Corona
sculpt<00:00:49.020> and<00:00:49.200> then<00:00:50.100> transfer<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.059> motion<00:00:51.449> data

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
sculpt and then transfer the motion data

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.840 
sculpt and then transfer the motion data
into<00:00:52.230> modo

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
into modo

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.029 
into modo
so<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.329> come<00:00:54.480> back<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.809> first<00:00:55.020> frame<00:00:55.289> we

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
so if I come back to the first frame we

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.790 
so if I come back to the first frame we
can<00:00:56.070> use<00:00:56.370> tools<00:00:56.730> such<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:58.050> drag<00:00:58.289> tool<00:00:58.530> and

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
can use tools such as the drag tool and

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.979 
can use tools such as the drag tool and
I'm<00:00:59.670> going<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.000> increase<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.629> number<00:01:00.660> of

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
I'm going to increase the number of

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.390 
I'm going to increase the number of
frames<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.590> say<00:01:02.359> 250

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:07.400 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.790 

and<00:01:07.490> we<00:01:08.300> can<00:01:08.420> very<00:01:08.630> easily<00:01:08.690> just<00:01:09.410> scale<00:01:09.680> the

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
and we can very easily just scale the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.790 
and we can very easily just scale the
brush<00:01:10.010> up<00:01:10.250> and<00:01:10.430> start<00:01:10.910> manipulating<00:01:11.800> this

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:12.800 
brush up and start manipulating this

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:20.940 
brush up and start manipulating this
splash

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.510 

you

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.330 

now<00:01:25.390> you'll<00:01:25.630> see<00:01:25.869> on<00:01:26.079> the<00:01:26.229> timeline<00:01:26.649> that<00:01:27.130> we

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
now you'll see on the timeline that we

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.060 
now you'll see on the timeline that we
have<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.939> morph<00:01:28.540> we<00:01:29.409> can<00:01:29.560> actually<00:01:29.680> click<00:01:30.009> and

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
have a morph we can actually click and

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.190 
have a morph we can actually click and
drag<00:01:30.369> this<00:01:30.520> around<00:01:30.700> as<00:01:31.149> we<00:01:31.390> wish<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:31.840> position

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 
drag this around as we wish and position

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.410 
drag this around as we wish and position
it<00:01:32.320> anywhere<00:01:32.409> on<00:01:32.770> the<00:01:32.860> timeline<00:01:33.090> we<00:01:34.090> can<00:01:34.119> also

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
it anywhere on the timeline we can also

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.020 
it anywhere on the timeline we can also
extend<00:01:35.259> it<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:37.020> change<00:01:38.020> the<00:01:38.200> start<00:01:38.380> time<00:01:39.030> if

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
extend it and change the start time if

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.330 
extend it and change the start time if
we<00:01:40.180> come<00:01:40.329> over<00:01:40.390> to<00:01:40.539> easy-out<00:01:41.020> we<00:01:41.799> can<00:01:41.950> grab<00:01:42.130> the

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
we come over to easy-out we can grab the

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.789 
we come over to easy-out we can grab the
top<00:01:42.549> handle<00:01:43.119> of<00:01:43.270> the<00:01:43.390> bezzie<00:01:43.689> a<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:44.049> shift<00:01:44.710> it

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
top handle of the bezzie a and shift it

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:46.859 
top handle of the bezzie a and shift it
all<00:01:44.979> the<00:01:45.100> way<00:01:45.189> over<00:01:45.310> to<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.610> right<00:01:45.789> and<00:01:45.970> that's

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
all the way over to the right and that's

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.510 
all the way over to the right and that's
exactly<00:01:47.140> what<00:01:47.439> we<00:01:47.560> want<00:01:47.740> it<00:01:47.770> to<00:01:47.830> do<00:01:48.039> because<00:01:48.280> we

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
exactly what we want it to do because we

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.460 
exactly what we want it to do because we
don't<00:01:48.670> want<00:01:48.880> this<00:01:49.000> morph<00:01:49.299> to<00:01:49.600> fade<00:01:50.020> out<00:01:50.049> we

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:50.470 
don't want this morph to fade out we

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.690 
don't want this morph to fade out we
want<00:01:50.649> it<00:01:50.710> to<00:01:50.830> continue<00:01:51.009> to<00:01:51.369> frame<00:01:52.060> 250<00:01:53.700> so

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:54.700 
want it to continue to frame 250 so

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.130 
want it to continue to frame 250 so
let's<00:01:55.030> shorten<00:01:55.240> the<00:01:55.450> ending<00:01:55.750> a<00:01:55.780> little<00:01:55.869> bit

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
let's shorten the ending a little bit

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.990 
let's shorten the ending a little bit
and<00:01:56.320> then<00:01:56.619> drag<00:01:56.950> the<00:01:57.130> morph<00:01:57.369> all<00:01:57.700> the<00:01:57.819> way<00:01:57.940> to

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 
and then drag the morph all the way to

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.190 
and then drag the morph all the way to
the<00:01:58.509> end<00:01:58.659> and<00:02:00.299> drag<00:02:01.299> the<00:02:01.450> star<00:02:01.690> all<00:02:01.959> the<00:02:01.990> way<00:02:02.140> to

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
the end and drag the star all the way to

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.410 
the end and drag the star all the way to
the<00:02:02.350> beginning<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:02.830> this<00:02:03.640> is<00:02:03.759> going<00:02:03.909> to<00:02:03.970> be<00:02:04.179> a

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
the beginning so this is going to be a

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.240 
the beginning so this is going to be a
slow-motion<00:02:05.970> water<00:02:06.970> splash<00:02:07.360> and<00:02:08.289> if<00:02:08.920> we<00:02:09.039> scrub

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
slow-motion water splash and if we scrub

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.280 
slow-motion water splash and if we scrub
through<00:02:09.459> now<00:02:09.850> you<00:02:10.179> can<00:02:10.630> see<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:10.929> we<00:02:11.080> do<00:02:11.260> have

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
through now you can see that we do have

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.449 
through now you can see that we do have
something<00:02:12.060> happening<00:02:13.060> already<00:02:13.299> and<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:15.220> far

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
something happening already and so far

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:16.920 
something happening already and so far
that<00:02:15.580> looks<00:02:15.760> pretty<00:02:15.940> good<00:02:16.180> just<00:02:16.420> by<00:02:16.569> doing<00:02:16.630> a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
that looks pretty good just by doing a

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
that looks pretty good just by doing a
few<00:02:17.140> tweaks<00:02:19.500> let's<00:02:20.500> come<00:02:20.650> back<00:02:20.769> to<00:02:20.860> the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
few tweaks let's come back to the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.930 
few tweaks let's come back to the
beginning<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:22.470> go<00:02:23.470> to<00:02:23.530> ease<00:02:23.980> in<00:02:24.190> let's<00:02:24.790> just

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
beginning and go to ease in let's just

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.080 
beginning and go to ease in let's just
add<00:02:25.120> a<00:02:25.150> bit<00:02:25.599> of<00:02:25.810> a<00:02:26.650> bit<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.310> an<00:02:27.459> ease<00:02:27.580> in<00:02:27.790> easy

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
add a bit of a bit of an ease in easy

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.060 
add a bit of a bit of an ease in easy
out<00:02:28.239> so<00:02:28.630> it<00:02:28.720> doesn't<00:02:28.870> start<00:02:29.200> or<00:02:29.470> end<00:02:29.500> so

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
out so it doesn't start or end so

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.030 
out so it doesn't start or end so
abruptly<00:02:31.260> and<00:02:32.260> you<00:02:32.410> can<00:02:32.560> see<00:02:32.709> that<00:02:32.829> those

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
abruptly and you can see that those

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.830 
abruptly and you can see that those
changes<00:02:33.280> happen<00:02:33.700> interactively<00:02:34.540> on<00:02:34.720> the

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
changes happen interactively on the

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.729 
changes happen interactively on the
timeline<00:02:35.820> we<00:02:36.820> can<00:02:36.970> also<00:02:37.090> come<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.840> say<00:02:38.170> about<00:02:38.709> a

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
timeline we can also come to say about a

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:41.460 
timeline we can also come to say about a
quarter<00:02:39.160> of<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.549> way<00:02:39.670> in<00:02:39.880> and<00:02:40.260> still<00:02:41.260> with<00:02:41.380> the

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
quarter of the way in and still with the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.410 
quarter of the way in and still with the
drag<00:02:41.650> tool<00:02:41.859> selected<00:02:42.430> manipulate<00:02:43.120> some<00:02:43.390> of

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
drag tool selected manipulate some of

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.220 
drag tool selected manipulate some of
the<00:02:43.570> smaller<00:02:43.840> areas<00:02:45.600> maybe<00:02:46.600> and<00:02:46.840> move<00:02:47.049> that

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
the smaller areas maybe and move that

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.729 
the smaller areas maybe and move that
guy<00:02:47.470> up<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.900> can<00:02:50.019> see<00:02:50.109> as<00:02:50.200> soon<00:02:50.320> as<00:02:50.470> I<00:02:50.530> start

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
guy up and it can see as soon as I start

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.470 
guy up and it can see as soon as I start
doing<00:02:50.890> that<00:02:51.040> we<00:02:51.400> get<00:02:51.549> another<00:02:51.880> morph<00:02:52.209> on<00:02:52.390> the

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
doing that we get another morph on the

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:04.080 
doing that we get another morph on the
timeline

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.349 

and<00:03:05.920> we're<00:03:06.920> gonna<00:03:07.010> do<00:03:07.189> the<00:03:07.310> same<00:03:07.519> thing<00:03:07.760> just

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
and we're gonna do the same thing just

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.720 
and we're gonna do the same thing just
bring<00:03:08.480> the<00:03:08.719> end<00:03:08.900> out<00:03:09.139> come<00:03:09.829> over<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.189> ease<00:03:10.489> out

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
bring the end out come over to ease out

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.479 
bring the end out come over to ease out
and<00:03:11.060> let's<00:03:12.019> drag<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.349> handle<00:03:13.099> all<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.400> way

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
and let's drag that handle all the way

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.539 
and let's drag that handle all the way
to<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:13.700> right

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
to the right

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.670 
to the right
bring<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.670> start<00:03:16.939> in<00:03:17.180> and<00:03:17.659> maybe<00:03:18.379> it<00:03:18.500> let's

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
bring the start in and maybe it let's

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.500 
bring the start in and maybe it let's
not<00:03:18.889> have<00:03:19.040> that<00:03:19.189> start<00:03:19.489> right<00:03:19.670> away<00:03:19.909> we'll

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
not have that start right away we'll

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.720 
not have that start right away we'll
move<00:03:20.629> it<00:03:20.810> over<00:03:21.200> to<00:03:21.560> about<00:03:21.889> a<00:03:22.129> quarter<00:03:22.400> of<00:03:22.549> the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
move it over to about a quarter of the

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:29.020 
move it over to about a quarter of the
way<00:03:22.849> in<00:03:26.950> actually<00:03:27.950> let's<00:03:28.129> move<00:03:28.310> it<00:03:28.400> over<00:03:28.459> here

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
way in actually let's move it over here

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.819 
way in actually let's move it over here
and<00:03:29.590> then<00:03:30.590> bring<00:03:30.859> the<00:03:31.010> start<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:33.530> about<00:03:33.799> a

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:33.829 
and then bring the start to about a

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.619 
and then bring the start to about a
quarter<00:03:34.219> of<00:03:34.250> the<00:03:34.400> way<00:03:34.519> in<00:03:37.209> and<00:03:38.209> again<00:03:38.480> let's

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
quarter of the way in and again let's

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:43.990 
quarter of the way in and again let's
give<00:03:38.750> a<00:03:38.810> little<00:03:38.959> bit<00:03:39.109> of<00:03:39.230> tension<00:03:42.790> so<00:03:43.790> now<00:03:43.939> you

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
give a little bit of tension so now you

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.479 
give a little bit of tension so now you
can<00:03:44.180> see<00:03:44.389> that<00:03:44.629> we<00:03:44.810> have<00:03:45.219> but<00:03:46.219> with<00:03:46.340> those

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:46.489 
can see that we have but with those

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:56.170 
can see that we have but with those
morphs<00:03:46.969> slowly<00:03:47.900> starting<00:03:53.379> okay<00:03:54.459> now<00:03:55.459> we<00:03:56.060> can

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
morphs slowly starting okay now we can

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.629 
morphs slowly starting okay now we can
also<00:03:56.419> manipulate<00:03:56.919> individual<00:03:57.919> objects<00:03:58.519> in

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
also manipulate individual objects in

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.699 
also manipulate individual objects in
this<00:03:58.760> mesh<00:03:59.030> so<00:03:59.689> as<00:03:59.810> you<00:03:59.930> can<00:04:00.049> see<00:04:00.199> this<00:04:00.409> little

00:04:00.699 --> 00:04:00.709 
this mesh so as you can see this little

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:02.709 
this mesh so as you can see this little
droplet<00:04:01.069> here<00:04:01.310> is<00:04:01.489> not<00:04:01.730> connected<00:04:02.419> to<00:04:02.449> the

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:02.719 
droplet here is not connected to the

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:05.170 
droplet here is not connected to the
overall<00:04:03.319> mesh<00:04:03.650> which<00:04:04.400> means<00:04:04.639> that<00:04:04.849> we<00:04:05.000> could

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:05.180 
overall mesh which means that we could

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.089 
overall mesh which means that we could
use<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.689> transform<00:04:06.290> tool<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:07.060> select<00:04:08.060> it<00:04:09.099> and

00:04:10.089 --> 00:04:10.099 
use the transform tool and select it and

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:11.860 
use the transform tool and select it and
you<00:04:10.759> can<00:04:10.879> see<00:04:10.939> that<00:04:11.060> we<00:04:11.150> can<00:04:11.269> come<00:04:11.419> anywhere<00:04:11.689> on

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
you can see that we can come anywhere on

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.990 
you can see that we can come anywhere on
the<00:04:11.959> timeline<00:04:13.599> and<00:04:15.009> just<00:04:16.009> maybe<00:04:16.310> move<00:04:16.609> it<00:04:16.759> over

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
the timeline and just maybe move it over

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.670 
the timeline and just maybe move it over
a<00:04:17.030> little<00:04:17.090> bit<00:04:17.449> say<00:04:18.079> we<00:04:18.199> want<00:04:18.409> it<00:04:18.440> to<00:04:18.560> go

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
a little bit say we want it to go

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.219 
a little bit say we want it to go
further<00:04:19.009> than<00:04:19.539> the<00:04:20.539> rest<00:04:20.750> of<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:20.930> mesh<00:04:21.109> is

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
further than the rest of the mesh is

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.170 
further than the rest of the mesh is
going<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:23.860> you<00:04:24.860> see<00:04:25.039> we<00:04:25.130> get<00:04:25.220> them<00:04:25.370> more<00:04:25.520> just

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
going and you see we get them more just

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.939 
going and you see we get them more just
for<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.449> object<00:04:26.659> there<00:04:27.110> and<00:04:27.349> if<00:04:27.650> we<00:04:27.740> scrub

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
for that object there and if we scrub

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:29.110 
for that object there and if we scrub
through<00:04:28.159> you<00:04:28.370> can<00:04:28.490> see<00:04:28.610> that<00:04:28.699> that<00:04:28.849> change

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:29.120 
through you can see that that change

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.710 
through you can see that that change
happens<00:04:29.570> goes<00:04:30.199> in<00:04:30.500> and<00:04:30.830> then<00:04:30.979> out<00:04:31.479> but<00:04:32.479> we<00:04:32.630> want

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
happens goes in and then out but we want

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.010 
happens goes in and then out but we want
to<00:04:32.840> do<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.050> same<00:04:33.229> thing<00:04:33.880> let's<00:04:34.880> shift<00:04:35.570> the<00:04:35.810> end

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
to do the same thing let's shift the end

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.050 
to do the same thing let's shift the end
out<00:04:36.289> like<00:04:36.830> that<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:39.490> drag<00:04:40.490> it<00:04:40.639> over<00:04:40.669> towards

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
out like that and drag it over towards

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:48.219 
out like that and drag it over towards
the<00:04:41.120> end<00:04:45.789> let's<00:04:46.789> have<00:04:46.909> it<00:04:46.940> start<00:04:47.330> relatively

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:48.229 
the end let's have it start relatively

00:04:48.229 --> 00:04:51.640 
the end let's have it start relatively
close<00:04:48.409> to<00:04:48.560> the<00:04:48.620> beginning<00:04:48.919> and<00:04:50.380> give<00:04:51.380> it<00:04:51.500> some

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
close to the beginning and give it some

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:53.620 
close to the beginning and give it some
tension<00:04:52.039> as<00:04:52.130> well

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
tension as well

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:57.170 
tension as well
and<00:04:54.890> now<00:04:55.890> you<00:04:55.950> can<00:04:56.130> see<00:04:56.340> that<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:56.730> change<00:04:57.030> is

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
and now you can see that that change is

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:02.300 
and now you can see that that change is
happening<00:04:57.360> by<00:04:58.290> itself<00:05:00.320> so<00:05:01.320> very<00:05:01.710> quickly<00:05:02.010> we

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
happening by itself so very quickly we

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:05.000 
happening by itself so very quickly we
created<00:05:02.820> this<00:05:03.020> slow-motion<00:05:04.020> splash<00:05:04.290> and<00:05:04.680> you

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
created this slow-motion splash and you

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.830 
created this slow-motion splash and you
can<00:05:05.130> mess<00:05:05.280> with<00:05:05.310> it<00:05:05.640> as<00:05:05.850> much<00:05:05.910> as<00:05:06.330> you<00:05:06.360> want<00:05:06.600> to

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
can mess with it as much as you want to

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.080 
can mess with it as much as you want to
get<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.200> result<00:05:07.500> you're<00:05:07.620> looking<00:05:07.650> for<00:05:08.070> but<00:05:08.880> at

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
get the result you're looking for but at

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.120 
get the result you're looking for but at
this<00:05:09.270> point<00:05:09.510> we<00:05:09.750> are<00:05:09.780> now<00:05:10.020> ready<00:05:10.290> to<00:05:10.380> take<00:05:10.980> this

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
this point we are now ready to take this

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.540 
this point we are now ready to take this
motion<00:05:11.520> data<00:05:11.900> directly<00:05:12.900> into<00:05:13.170> modo<00:05:13.710> now

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
motion data directly into modo now

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.570 
motion data directly into modo now
what's<00:05:14.910> cool<00:05:15.060> is<00:05:15.360> that<00:05:15.390> modo<00:05:16.020> imports<00:05:17.040> LWO

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
what's cool is that modo imports LWO

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.720 
what's cool is that modo imports LWO
files<00:05:17.970> directly<00:05:18.750> from<00:05:18.870> Lightwave<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.100> it

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:20.730 
files directly from Lightwave and it

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:23.210 
files directly from Lightwave and it
also<00:05:20.910> imports<00:05:21.690> MDD<00:05:22.290> files<00:05:22.530> which<00:05:22.890> you<00:05:22.920> can

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
also imports MDD files which you can

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.800 
also imports MDD files which you can
export<00:05:23.610> directly<00:05:24.000> from<00:05:24.180> lightwaves

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:24.810 
export directly from lightwaves

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.560 
export directly from lightwaves
and<00:05:24.930> chrono<00:05:25.530> sculpt<00:05:25.940> so<00:05:26.940> at<00:05:27.030> this<00:05:27.150> point<00:05:27.360> all

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
and chrono sculpt so at this point all

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:30.310 
and chrono sculpt so at this point all
we<00:05:27.780> want<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:28.020> do<00:05:28.200> is<00:05:28.380> come<00:05:28.950> to<00:05:29.070> frame<00:05:29.220> 0<00:05:29.250> and

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
we want to do is come to frame 0 and

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.890 
we want to do is come to frame 0 and
let's<00:05:31.320> go<00:05:31.440> to<00:05:31.500> file<00:05:32.300> save<00:05:33.300> MD<00:05:33.720> D<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:35.780> I'm<00:05:36.780> just

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
let's go to file save MD D and I'm just

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.030 
let's go to file save MD D and I'm just
going<00:05:37.050> to<00:05:37.080> save<00:05:37.320> this<00:05:37.560> as<00:05:37.800> splash<00:05:38.790> and<00:05:40.040> let's

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
going to save this as splash and let's

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:45.020 
going to save this as splash and let's
hit<00:05:41.220> save<00:05:43.040> so<00:05:44.040> now<00:05:44.160> we're<00:05:44.280> ready<00:05:44.400> to<00:05:44.610> jump<00:05:44.820> into

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
hit save so now we're ready to jump into

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.770 
hit save so now we're ready to jump into
modo<00:05:46.400> so<00:05:47.400> here<00:05:47.580> we<00:05:47.669> are<00:05:47.700> inside<00:05:47.970> of<00:05:48.180> modo<00:05:48.480> and

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:48.780 
modo so here we are inside of modo and

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:51.710 
modo so here we are inside of modo and
all<00:05:49.560> I<00:05:49.590> did<00:05:49.710> was<00:05:49.860> import<00:05:50.520> the<00:05:50.700> LWO<00:05:51.330> file

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
all I did was import the LWO file

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.070 
all I did was import the LWO file
directly<00:05:52.350> from<00:05:52.740> lightwaves<00:05:53.520> modeler<00:05:53.940> and<00:05:54.150> can

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080 
directly from lightwaves modeler and can

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.370 
directly from lightwaves modeler and can
see<00:05:55.260> that<00:05:55.290> it<00:05:55.590> imports<00:05:56.070> perfectly<00:05:56.520> fine<00:05:57.380> now

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:58.380 
see that it imports perfectly fine now

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:01.040 
see that it imports perfectly fine now
we<00:05:58.440> want<00:05:58.740> to<00:05:58.860> add<00:05:59.100> the<00:05:59.550> motion<00:06:00.090> data<00:06:00.240> file<00:06:00.540> the

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:01.050 
we want to add the motion data file the

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.500 
we want to add the motion data file the
MDD<00:06:01.410> file<00:06:01.740> onto<00:06:02.070> this<00:06:02.460> object<00:06:02.669> that<00:06:03.300> we

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
MDD file onto this object that we

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.510 
MDD file onto this object that we
exported<00:06:03.990> from<00:06:04.230> chrono<00:06:04.440> salt<00:06:04.710> there's<00:06:05.400> a

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
exported from chrono salt there's a

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:08.300 
exported from chrono salt there's a
couple<00:06:05.669> ways<00:06:05.820> to<00:06:05.880> do<00:06:06.120> this<00:06:06.300> we<00:06:06.930> could<00:06:07.080> hit<00:06:07.290> v<00:06:07.830> to

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
couple ways to do this we could hit v to

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.570 
couple ways to do this we could hit v to
go<00:06:08.610> into<00:06:08.880> item<00:06:09.240> mode<00:06:09.450> and<00:06:10.130> right<00:06:11.130> click<00:06:11.340> on<00:06:11.460> the

mesh add the former and add the MDD
influence<00:06:15.740> now<00:06:16.740> if<00:06:16.950> you<00:06:17.040> have<00:06:17.160> a<00:06:17.190> lot<00:06:17.370> of

screen but it would be influences and

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:32.240 
screen but it would be influences and
then<00:06:29.130> MDD<00:06:29.820> influence<00:06:30.830> so<00:06:31.830> for<00:06:31.950> the<00:06:32.010> sake<00:06:32.160> of

then MDD influence so for the sake of

then MDD influence so for the sake of
this<00:06:32.340> tutorial<00:06:32.400> i'll<00:06:32.940> just<00:06:33.240> do<00:06:33.330> it<00:06:33.450> through

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
this tutorial i'll just do it through

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:40.940 
this tutorial i'll just do it through
the<00:06:33.750> mesh<00:06:38.570> select

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:40.950 
the mesh select

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:44.130 
the mesh select
now<00:06:41.950> right<00:06:42.220> now<00:06:42.400> we're<00:06:42.790> in<00:06:43.060> model<00:06:43.630> mode<00:06:43.810> so

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
now right now we're in model mode so

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:45.090 
now right now we're in model mode so
you're<00:06:44.260> not<00:06:44.350> going<00:06:44.500> to<00:06:44.560> see<00:06:44.740> anything

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:45.100 
you're not going to see anything

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:47.280 
you're not going to see anything
happening<00:06:45.490> but<00:06:46.030> you<00:06:46.120> can<00:06:46.270> see<00:06:46.540> that<00:06:46.810> we<00:06:47.110> do

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:47.290 
happening but you can see that we do

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:49.290 
happening but you can see that we do
have<00:06:47.530> some<00:06:47.680> options<00:06:48.070> for<00:06:48.160> the<00:06:48.400> MDD<00:06:48.700> down<00:06:49.000> here

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
have some options for the MDD down here

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.840 
have some options for the MDD down here
but<00:06:50.170> for<00:06:50.440> now<00:06:50.560> the<00:06:50.950> default<00:06:51.370> settings<00:06:51.760> are

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:51.850 
but for now the default settings are

00:06:51.850 --> 00:06:53.910 
but for now the default settings are
going<00:06:51.910> to<00:06:52.000> work<00:06:52.150> just<00:06:52.330> fine<00:06:52.560> if<00:06:53.560> we<00:06:53.680> come<00:06:53.890> over

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:53.920 
going to work just fine if we come over

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.070 
going to work just fine if we come over
to<00:06:54.130> the<00:06:54.250> anim<00:06:54.700> tab

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.080 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:01.490 

and<00:06:58.280> scrub<00:06:59.280> through<00:06:59.400> the<00:06:59.460> timeline<00:07:00.470> you<00:07:01.470> can

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
and scrub through the timeline you can

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.710 
and scrub through the timeline you can
see<00:07:01.830> that<00:07:01.979> we<00:07:02.099> have<00:07:02.280> this<00:07:02.400> flash<00:07:02.669> exactly<00:07:03.539> as

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
see that we have this flash exactly as

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.740 
see that we have this flash exactly as
we<00:07:03.930> have<00:07:04.139> it<00:07:04.319> in<00:07:04.500> chrome<00:07:05.129> sculpt<00:07:05.490> now<00:07:06.419> it<00:07:06.599> is<00:07:06.719> a

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:06.750 
we have it in chrome sculpt now it is a
