god<00:02:37.290> I<00:02:37.319> wanted<00:02:37.769> to<00:02:37.890> go<00:02:38.250> down<00:02:38.579> a<00:02:38.640> gear<00:02:39.060> and<00:02:39.239> it

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.660 

it's<00:02:49.849> so<00:02:50.209> fast<00:02:50.630> but<00:02:50.989> then<00:02:51.110> it's<00:02:51.470> not<00:02:51.590> kind<00:02:52.550> of

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
it's so fast but then it's not kind of

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.120 
it's so fast but then it's not kind of
sloppy<00:02:53.090> in<00:02:53.420> the<00:02:53.510> corners<00:02:53.930> because<00:02:54.110> it's<00:02:54.890> just

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.130 
sloppy in the corners because it's just

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.010

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:43.520 
vibrating hood problem but they have not

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.840 
vibrating hood problem but they have not
hopefully<00:03:44.510> with<00:03:44.660> the<00:03:44.780> GT<00:03:45.110> 350<00:03:45.800> they<00:03:45.950> will<00:03:46.160> but

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
hopefully with the GT 350 they will but

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:52.040 
hopefully with the GT 350 they will but
they<00:03:47.030> certainly<00:03:47.330> have<00:03:47.570> in<00:03:47.900> here

probably okay on the street if you can

00:07:01.439 --> 00:07:04.380 
probably okay on the street if you can
keep<00:07:01.559> your<00:07:01.620> foot<00:07:01.979> out<00:07:02.009> of<00:07:02.309> it
