00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.380
 so many years out somehow 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.029
 during the last decade, believe me 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.730
 I was the last book already 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.530
 huge hype that came out in 2009 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.140

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.480

 Luebbe Publish these books out 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.700

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.379
 very quickly and only bring out 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.120

 That was done and now this time 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.119
 even more extreme this book is coming 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.590
 even at the same time as the English book 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.439
 in the shops that is called the English 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.549
 edition the german edition 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.930
 at the same time in the shop you can 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.220
 at the same time buy I think the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.290
 Most of you will become German 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.100
 issue as I tend that too 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:26.100
 I 've already read it for 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.409
 read you and I can tell you yes 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.670
 very very very very exciting great the 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.890
 I really liked it 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.140
 You can really look forward to what I am 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.130
 can highly recommend 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.229
 just like in the other books 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.450
 it is also about here 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.130
 conspiracy theories where you look 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.259
 can not be quite sure what 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.810
 it is true now what it was not 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.920
 In general, I think that in any case 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.170
 It also a bit of a knowledge 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.210
 Factor is so knowing facts can says 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.409
 In any case, learn a lot because it 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.810
 just become a lot of historical 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.579
 events or even paintings discussed 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.770
 they are really exciting 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.030
 is called reality and fiction so close 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.119
 together that you completely on then 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.259
 think it's true that now really 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.450
 is that really what you want to do now 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.459

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.490
 I liked it very well that it here 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.070
 In any case, again the case of 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.840
 dan brown remains faithful to the art 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.810
 and wise very similar to the others 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.010
