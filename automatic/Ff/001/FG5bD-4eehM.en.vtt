00:00:38.619 --> 00:00:38.629 
review your channel here are the rules

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.799 
review your channel here are the rules
so<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:40.050> first<00:00:40.290> rule<00:00:40.710> is<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.820> can't<00:00:41.850> have<00:00:42.450> more

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
so the first rule is you can't have more

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.619 
so the first rule is you can't have more
than<00:00:42.920> 3000<00:00:43.920> subscribers<00:00:44.210> you<00:00:45.210> just<00:00:45.420> can't

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
than 3000 subscribers you just can't

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.799 
than 3000 subscribers you just can't
have<00:00:45.870> 4,000<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:46.890> above<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:48.390> reason<00:00:48.780> for

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
have 4,000 and above and the reason for

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.250 
have 4,000 and above and the reason for
this<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.559> because<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:50.850> is<00:00:51.030> not<00:00:51.390> only<00:00:51.660> like<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
this is because this is not only like a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.810 
this is because this is not only like a
review<00:00:52.710> series<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.219> kind<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.550> shout<00:00:53.789> outs
