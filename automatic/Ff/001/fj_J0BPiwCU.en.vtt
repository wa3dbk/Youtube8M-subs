so I just wanted to run through a couple
of<00:00:17.760> things<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.180> really<00:00:18.240> love<00:00:18.690> about<00:00:18.750> it

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
of things that I really love about it

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.900 
of things that I really love about it
anything<00:00:19.529> that<00:00:19.680> stands<00:00:20.039> out<00:00:20.250> with<00:00:20.369> me<00:00:20.609> about

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
anything that stands out with me about

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.630 
anything that stands out with me about
this<00:00:21.180> mascara<00:00:21.510> is<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:21.960> brush<00:00:22.619> so<00:00:23.279> as<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:23.519> can

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
this mascara is the brush so as you can

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.120 
this mascara is the brush so as you can
see<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.210> is<00:00:24.359> a<00:00:24.390> really<00:00:24.480> lovely<00:00:25.199> thick<00:00:25.740> full

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
see it is a really lovely thick full

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.060 
see it is a really lovely thick full
brush<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.820> fiber<00:00:27.359> bristles<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.289> it's

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
brush with fiber bristles and it's

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.429 
brush with fiber bristles and it's
pretty<00:00:29.550> similar<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.330> original<00:00:30.539> falsies

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
pretty similar to the original falsies

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.470 
pretty similar to the original falsies
but<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.859> think<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.399> gets<00:00:32.520> my<00:00:32.730> lashes<00:00:32.969> better<00:00:33.360> off

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
but I think it gets my lashes better off

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.979 
but I think it gets my lashes better off
so<00:00:34.020> this<00:00:34.200> is<00:00:34.440> them<00:00:34.680> compared<00:00:35.630> if<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.719> can<00:00:36.840> see

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
so this is them compared if you can see

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.369 
so this is them compared if you can see
that<00:00:37.200> they're<00:00:37.530> fairly<00:00:37.980> similar<00:00:38.250> but<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.690> fled

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that they're fairly similar but the fled

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.020 
that they're fairly similar but the fled
one<00:00:40.620> is<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> little<00:00:41.190> bit<00:00:41.309> thicker<00:00:41.579> than<00:00:41.700> the

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
one is a little bit thicker than the

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.940 
one is a little bit thicker than the
original<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.989> next<00:00:43.230> thing<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.440> love<00:00:43.649> about<00:00:43.680> it

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950
