00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:08.040 

sage

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:10.330 

it<00:03:09.050> looks<00:03:09.200> like<00:03:09.380> there<00:03:09.680> are<00:03:09.800> some<00:03:10.010> kind<00:03:10.250> of

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
it looks like there are some kind of

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:20.620 
it looks like there are some kind of
cards<00:03:10.850> in<00:03:11.030> this<00:03:11.180> game<00:03:18.460> okay<00:03:19.460> so<00:03:19.520> apparently<00:03:20.390> I

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
cards in this game okay so apparently I

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.070 
cards in this game okay so apparently I
own<00:03:20.900> three<00:03:21.170> members<00:03:21.710> and<00:03:22.390> the<00:03:23.390> opponent<00:03:23.930> is

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 
own three members and the opponent is

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:38.089 
own three members and the opponent is
only<00:03:24.230> one

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.790 

now<00:03:39.099> I'm<00:03:39.340> starting<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.760> get<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.500> I<00:03:41.530> have

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
now I'm starting to get it so I have

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.040 
now I'm starting to get it so I have
three<00:03:41.980> heroes<00:03:42.489> one<00:03:42.790> is<00:03:42.940> firewater<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
three heroes one is firewater and the

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.559 
three heroes one is firewater and the
other<00:03:44.140> one<00:03:44.380> is<00:03:44.530> wood<00:03:44.800> and<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:46.000> ruins<00:03:46.300> over

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
other one is wood and the ruins over

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.260 
other one is wood and the ruins over
there<00:03:46.750> represent<00:03:47.440> them<00:03:47.650> so<00:03:48.400> if<00:03:48.610> I<00:03:48.760> choose<00:03:48.970> the

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
there represent them so if I choose the

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:54.120 
there represent them so if I choose the
pile<00:03:49.510> rules<00:03:51.390> the<00:03:52.390> fire<00:03:52.630> one<00:03:52.900> will<00:03:53.110> attack<00:03:53.470> the

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
pile rules the fire one will attack the

00:03:54.130 --> 00:04:17.620 
pile rules the fire one will attack the
opponent<00:03:54.610> all<00:03:55.480> right<00:03:55.630> that's<00:03:55.840> cool

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.830 

oh<00:04:21.430> so<00:04:22.430> this<00:04:22.640> is<00:04:22.760> pretty<00:04:22.910> much<00:04:23.000> like<00:04:23.120> Pokemon

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
oh so this is pretty much like Pokemon

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.380 
oh so this is pretty much like Pokemon
used<00:04:24.080> to<00:04:24.260> be<00:04:24.380> I<00:04:24.590> mean<00:04:25.130> it<00:04:25.910> looks<00:04:26.120> like<00:04:26.180> the

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
used to be I mean it looks like the

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.170 
used to be I mean it looks like the
opponent's<00:04:27.080> each<00:04:27.470> have<00:04:28.010> some<00:04:28.820> kind<00:04:29.060> of

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
opponent's each have some kind of

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:31.540 
opponent's each have some kind of
artifacts<00:04:30.020> like<00:04:30.200> this<00:04:30.470> one<00:04:30.710> is<00:04:30.860> water<00:04:31.130> this<00:04:31.490> is
