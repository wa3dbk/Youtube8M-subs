00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.400
 players or so on this account or this 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:05.030

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.540
 had to learn are the players 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.460
 green olives that that yellow pineapples 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.549

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:23.540
 look how my racket can say this 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.820
 but the count also always on live stream 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.740
 and then you can never have consequences 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.630
 but nice to be fucking and growing 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.670

 pretty nice view is a first owner club 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.160

 watching was true because i got it 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.560

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.750

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.120
 me because I now also include 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.000
 chassis 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:57.920
 hack to the ground and it is one 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.610
 seventh or capek and I only get it 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.320

 I look sawed and in people 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:05.450
 less 90k setup and hope someone 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.880
 looks on her saw as name and then that 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.700

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.360
 up to 40 channels it would be broken 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.370

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.500
 ie the person himself by actually nothing 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.540
 what the ordinary my balls were 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.550
 league plays in the sense of 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.220
 then we are not good players in the 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.690
 turkish league but sneijder is okay and 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.770

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.750

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:04.090
 why I come in molds 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:06.250

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.050
 other than that santo 

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.820
 years to do this are players like let 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.770

 i can't be patient and people 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.010
 in the world I think think on jacob 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.650
