that you know compensate for that to fit

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.400 
that you know compensate for that to fit
down<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.750> there<00:02:47.960> when<00:02:48.800> you're<00:02:48.950> doing<00:02:49.330> lower

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
down in there when you're doing lower

crown portions you can go all the way

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:56.650 
crown portions you can go all the way
down<00:02:54.950> to<00:02:55.310> some<00:02:55.760> that<00:02:55.940> appear<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.540> be

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
down to some that appear to be

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.660 
down to some that appear to be
completely<00:02:57.290> flat<00:02:57.470> like<00:02:57.950> this<00:02:58.160> one<00:02:58.340> but<00:02:58.430> this

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
completely flat like this one but this

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.430 
completely flat like this one but this
actually<00:02:59.000> has<00:02:59.180> a<00:02:59.300> twelve<00:02:59.630> inch<00:02:59.750> radius<00:03:00.050> on<00:03:00.410> it

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440 
actually has a twelve inch radius on it

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.440 
actually has a twelve inch radius on it
this<00:03:01.070> works<00:03:01.340> good<00:03:01.520> for<00:03:01.730> like<00:03:01.820> door<00:03:02.060> skins<00:03:02.330> when

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
this works good for like door skins when

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.330 
this works good for like door skins when
you<00:03:02.570> want<00:03:02.720> to<00:03:02.780> put<00:03:02.930> a<00:03:02.960> sweep<00:03:03.230> in<00:03:03.410> it<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:04.040> just

wheel<00:04:07.480> this<00:04:08.480> way<00:04:08.830> so<00:04:09.830> you<00:04:09.920> get<00:04:10.010> a<00:04:10.069> perfect

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
wheel this way so you get a perfect

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.760 
wheel this way so you get a perfect
contact<00:04:11.000> and<00:04:11.330> that's<00:04:11.900> really<00:04:12.200> important<00:04:12.650> when

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:12.770 
contact and that's really important when

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.180 
contact and that's really important when
you're<00:04:12.920> using<00:04:12.980> your<00:04:13.250> wider<00:04:13.580> tracking<00:04:14.209> wheels

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
you're using your wider tracking wheels

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.360 
you're using your wider tracking wheels
and<00:04:16.190> just<00:04:16.910> came<00:04:17.090> up<00:04:17.150> and<00:04:17.480> down<00:04:18.100> once<00:04:19.100> you<00:04:19.220> get

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:19.370 
and just came up and down once you get

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.460 
and just came up and down once you get
your<00:04:19.549> part<00:04:19.820> in<00:04:19.970> there

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
your part in there

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:23.110 
your part in there
and<00:04:21.470> this<00:04:21.620> one<00:04:21.799> here<00:04:22.040> you<00:04:22.250> loosen<00:04:22.850> to<00:04:22.940> give

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
and this one here you loosen to give

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.159 
and this one here you loosen to give
here<00:04:23.389> and<00:04:23.540> it<00:04:23.630> has<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.139> kick<00:04:24.350> will<00:04:24.560> actually

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
here and it has the kick will actually

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:29.050 
here and it has the kick will actually
moves<00:04:27.169> the<00:04:27.470> screwed<00:04:28.250> up<00:04:28.370> there's<00:04:28.610> an<00:04:28.729> ACME

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
moves the screwed up there's an ACME

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.550 
moves the screwed up there's an ACME
thread<00:04:29.360> in<00:04:29.479> there<00:04:29.630> that<00:04:29.810> runs<00:04:29.960> it<00:04:30.169> up<00:04:30.290> and<00:04:30.440> down

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
thread in there that runs it up and down

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.950 
thread in there that runs it up and down
you<00:04:31.280> did<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.580> reason<00:04:32.030> there's<00:04:32.270> these<00:04:32.600> folks

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
you did the reason there's these folks

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.780 
you did the reason there's these folks
are<00:04:33.169> for<00:04:33.410> actually<00:04:33.919> kicking<00:04:34.310> it<00:04:34.430> over<00:04:34.550> but

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:34.790 
are for actually kicking it over but

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:36.670 
are for actually kicking it over but
some<00:04:34.970> guys<00:04:35.210> use<00:04:35.540> this<00:04:35.780> to<00:04:36.020> kind<00:04:36.229> of<00:04:36.350> keep<00:04:36.500> track

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
some guys use this to kind of keep track

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.250 
some guys use this to kind of keep track
of<00:04:36.979> how<00:04:37.100> much<00:04:37.310> pressure<00:04:38.020> you<00:04:39.020> know<00:04:39.110> if<00:04:39.169> you

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
of how much pressure you know if you

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.200 
of how much pressure you know if you
kick<00:04:39.440> in<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.650> half<00:04:39.830> a<00:04:39.950> spoke<00:04:40.220> that's<00:04:40.520> X<00:04:40.910> amount

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.210 
kick in a half a spoke that's X amount

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.790 
kick in a half a spoke that's X amount
of<00:04:41.300> pressure<00:04:41.540> if<00:04:41.780> you<00:04:41.870> want<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.169> memorize<00:04:42.560> that

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
of pressure if you want to memorize that

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.659 
of pressure if you want to memorize that
kind<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.130> stuff<00:04:43.340> you<00:04:44.350> know<00:04:45.350> this<00:04:45.979> is<00:04:46.130> a<00:04:46.160> basic

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
kind of stuff you know this is a basic

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.129 
kind of stuff you know this is a basic
anatomy<00:04:47.570> of<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:48.080> machine<00:04:49.000> this<00:04:50.000> one<00:04:50.240> here<00:04:50.630> was

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
anatomy of the machine this one here was

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:54.219 
anatomy of the machine this one here was
built<00:04:51.380> at<00:04:51.889> the<00:04:52.010> factory<00:04:52.540> we<00:04:53.540> offer<00:04:53.720> this<00:04:53.990> one

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
built at the factory we offer this one

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:55.719 
built at the factory we offer this one
in<00:04:54.350> a<00:04:54.380> kit<00:04:54.680> form<00:04:54.979> where<00:04:55.250> you<00:04:55.340> get<00:04:55.490> everything

00:04:55.719 --> 00:04:55.729 
in a kit form where you get everything

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:57.219 
in a kit form where you get everything
you<00:04:55.880> need<00:04:55.970> except<00:04:56.450> for<00:04:56.479> the<00:04:56.690> steel<00:04:56.930> for<00:04:57.110> the

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
you need except for the steel for the

00:04:57.229 --> 00:04:59.950 
you need except for the steel for the
frame<00:04:57.470> and<00:04:57.650> an<00:04:57.770> instruction<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.310> build<00:04:58.520> it<00:04:58.960> so

00:04:59.950 --> 00:04:59.960 
frame and an instruction to build it so

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:02.800 
frame and an instruction to build it so
with<00:05:00.770> that<00:05:01.010> we<00:05:01.820> can<00:05:02.000> start<00:05:02.330> looking<00:05:02.450> at<00:05:02.660> our

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:02.810 
with that we can start looking at our

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.020 
with that we can start looking at our
project
