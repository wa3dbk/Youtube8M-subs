this is the completed look

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.450 
this is the completed look
and<00:02:51.380> I<00:02:52.100> think<00:02:52.630> investing<00:02:53.630> in<00:02:53.840> a<00:02:54.380> sweater<00:02:54.980> vest

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
and I think investing in a sweater vest

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.810 
and I think investing in a sweater vest
if<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:55.850> must<00:02:56.330> when<00:02:56.840> play<00:02:57.170> with<00:02:57.350> layers<00:02:57.820> because

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
if a must when play with layers because

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.420 
if a must when play with layers because
it<00:02:59.090> helps<00:02:59.480> add<00:02:59.720> dimension<00:03:00.470> to<00:03:00.680> our<00:03:01.100> look

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
it helps add dimension to our look

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.550 
it helps add dimension to our look
without<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.000> bulk<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.900> doesn't<00:03:03.230> have<00:03:03.350> any

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
without the bulk it doesn't have any

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.400 
without the bulk it doesn't have any
sleeves<00:03:03.860> this<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.850> my<00:03:05.120> Sawyer<00:03:05.630> vest
