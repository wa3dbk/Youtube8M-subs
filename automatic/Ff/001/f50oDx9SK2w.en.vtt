00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
what we did was we we rebuilt two sets

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.270 
and behold the set with Forks cans are
still<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.180> new<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.079> set<00:00:52.289> without<00:00:52.410> have

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
still like new and the set without have

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.069 
still like new and the set without have
started<00:00:53.670> leaky<00:00:54.120> men<00:00:54.360> I've<00:00:54.480> been<00:00:54.629> chasing<00:00:55.020> a

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
started leaky men I've been chasing a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.709 
started leaky men I've been chasing a
leaking<00:00:55.410> oil<00:00:55.559> for<00:00:56.280> sea<00:00:56.520> life<00:00:56.760> for<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.360> couple<00:00:57.690> of

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
leaking oil for sea life for a couple of

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.500 
leaking oil for sea life for a couple of
months<00:00:58.109> so<00:00:59.070> after<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.699> year's<00:01:00.000> time<00:01:00.210> riding

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
months so after a year's time riding

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.240 
months so after a year's time riding
them<00:01:00.629> I'm<00:01:00.840> pretty<00:01:01.440> convinced<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.949> they<00:01:02.100> work

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
them I'm pretty convinced that they work

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.609 
them I'm pretty convinced that they work
pretty<00:01:02.520> well<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:03.030> we<00:01:03.600> just<00:01:03.629> serviced<00:01:04.470> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
pretty well so we just serviced the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.140 
pretty well so we just serviced the
other<00:01:04.860> set<00:01:05.250> of<00:01:05.339> forks<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.850> we're<00:01:06.060> gonna

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
other set of forks and we're gonna

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.120 
other set of forks and we're gonna
install<00:01:06.390> these<00:01:06.750> today<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.140> I'm<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> show

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
install these today so I'm going to show

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.770 
install these today so I'm going to show
you<00:01:08.159> just<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.520> little<00:01:08.700> bit<00:01:08.939> about<00:01:09.270> how<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.540> go

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
you just a little bit about how to go

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.870 
you just a little bit about how to go
through<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.740> main<00:01:10.920> issue<00:01:11.130> is<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.580> these

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
through the main issue is that these

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.090 
through the main issue is that these
things<00:01:12.030> are<00:01:12.210> actually<00:01:12.330> really<00:01:12.479> small<00:01:13.110> because

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
things are actually really small because

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.880 
things are actually really small because
a<00:01:14.600> they<00:01:15.600> need<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:16.020> basically<00:01:16.560> scrape

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
a they need to basically scrape

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.620 
a they need to basically scrape
everything<00:01:17.310> clean<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.700> be<00:01:17.970> they<00:01:18.150> stretch<00:01:18.450> out

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
everything clean and be they stretch out

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.200 
everything clean and be they stretch out
pretty<00:01:18.869> quick<00:01:19.140> over<00:01:19.380> time<00:01:19.560> so<00:01:20.549> installing

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
pretty quick over time so installing

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.149 
pretty quick over time so installing
them<00:01:21.630> what<00:01:21.810> I<00:01:21.840> found<00:01:22.259> is<00:01:22.500> the<00:01:22.650> easiest<00:01:22.890> way<00:01:23.130> to

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
them what I found is the easiest way to

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.179 
them what I found is the easiest way to
keep<00:01:23.430> from<00:01:23.700> stretching<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.540> neoprene<00:01:24.930> is<00:01:25.439> to

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
keep from stretching the neoprene is to

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.950 
keep from stretching the neoprene is to
spray<00:01:26.790> down<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.000> fork<00:01:27.270> leg<00:01:27.479> with<00:01:27.689> pledge

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
spray down the fork leg with pledge

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.740 
spray down the fork leg with pledge
first<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:29.310> makes<00:01:29.520> them<00:01:29.729> slide<00:01:30.060> on<00:01:30.299> really

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
first that makes them slide on really

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.420 
first that makes them slide on really
easy<00:01:31.159> also<00:01:32.159> pledge<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.240> pretty<00:01:33.570> much<00:01:33.810> the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
easy also pledge is pretty much the

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.730 
easy also pledge is pretty much the
cure-all<00:01:35.430> for<00:01:36.420> everything<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.990> Forks<00:01:37.409> every

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
cure-all for everything on Forks every

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.370 
cure-all for everything on Forks every
time<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:38.040> wash<00:01:38.310> your<00:01:38.520> bike<00:01:39.110> wipe<00:01:40.110> down<00:01:40.350> your

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
time you wash your bike wipe down your

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.530 
time you wash your bike wipe down your
fork<00:01:40.799> legs<00:01:41.040> with<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> pledge<00:01:41.850> and<00:01:42.180> that<00:01:42.390> will

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
fork legs with the pledge and that will

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.270 
fork legs with the pledge and that will
get<00:01:42.659> rid<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:44.070> the<00:01:44.430> excess<00:01:45.180> water<00:01:45.420> spots

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
get rid of all of the excess water spots

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.740 
get rid of all of the excess water spots
and<00:01:47.280> make<00:01:47.610> your<00:01:47.790> Forks<00:01:48.090> nice<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.750> smooth<00:01:49.500> so

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
and make your Forks nice and smooth so

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:54.490 
and make your Forks nice and smooth so
with<00:01:51.750> pledge<00:01:52.049> these<00:01:52.380> just<00:01:52.680> slide<00:01:52.890> right<00:01:53.159> on

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
with pledge these just slide right on

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.319 
with pledge these just slide right on
and<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:56.759> appropriate<00:01:58.100> setting<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.329> according

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
and the appropriate setting is according

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.230 
and the appropriate setting is according
to<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.780> fork<00:02:01.020> skins<00:02:01.640> sixty<00:02:02.640> percent<00:02:02.820> below

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
to the fork skins sixty percent below

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.620 
to the fork skins sixty percent below
forty<00:02:03.689> percent<00:02:03.869> still<00:02:04.619> above<00:02:05.329> so<00:02:06.329> there<00:02:06.509> we

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
forty percent still above so there we

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.740 
forty percent still above so there we
have<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:06.840> on<00:02:07.910> so<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> seam<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.390> facing

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
have it on so the seam is facing

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.360 
have it on so the seam is facing
backwards<00:02:10.140> now<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.770> other<00:02:10.950> thing<00:02:11.129> is<00:02:11.250> they

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
backwards now the other thing is they

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.010 
backwards now the other thing is they
