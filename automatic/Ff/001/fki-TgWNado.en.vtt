00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:18.230
 Hi, I'm Marianelli, I'm 29 years old. 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.000
 shoe designer I have my own 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.510
 brand that is called move and cachita and 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.439
 apart he made him different 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:30.290
 marks my dad is military in retirement my 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:33.050
 Mom is in chalk and executive study 

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:35.780
 everything is a bit of work 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.239
 little too and I realized that it was not 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.190
 what's mine being in the system until 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.800
 looking at the ceiling one day it occurred to me 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.070
 what to do 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.720
 and I decided to make my own shoes 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.610
 love shoes I think that all 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.790
 the girls love the shoes but 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:53.290
 the problem is that they are a little expensive 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.720
 and most of the shoes that are in the 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.129
 market are a bit uncomfortable then 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.530
 I decided to make my own shoes 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.019
 very comfortable and cute I started my 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:04.030
 company with zero zero capital and a sun 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.710
 the best companies are made with zero 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.810
 capital you knew that they did my 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.720
 shoes and I started to give the devotees to 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.530
 my friends and I sent a communal mail and if 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.110
 a powerpoint with leathers 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.090
 and more than 100 orders fell that same 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.670
 each day I could choose the colors 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.320
 of their shoes were leather and they had 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.580
 double quilted and a communism 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.580
 they started being ordered 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.560
 Well, I think you 're good at what 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.690
 what do you have to learn from scratch 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.640
 everything not me for a lot in the workshop 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.800
 with the shoemakers and I loved 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.480
 ask them everything about how they do it 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.190
 how they cut it why they cut it because 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.380
 they stick it like that because they pull it because 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:44.180
 they hammered and they went crazy all the 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.790
 day the shoemakers then measured with the 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.570
 girls to caquetá to show me where 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.670
 they buy the material as I had 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.770
 in the material of course with the 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.210
 you pay for a flat when she is alone 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.210
 because you always forget in some 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.270
 little things but you are learning good 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.470
 principle outsourced the service of 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.400
 confection but as my orders were 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.280
 personalized and each shoe was 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.320
 different shoemakers did not meet me 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.310
 over time they did not comply with the 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.380
 deliveries 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.209
 If I was not sitting at the finishes 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.760
 they were not very good then yes I do not 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:19.590
 I was there 24 hours a day 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.540
 supervising the work was not going to stay 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.550
 as I wanted to and I decided to open my own 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.530
 workshop then I'm here that is 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.989
 complete to the machinery that he needed 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.090
 but so closing your eyes and just 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.280
 I opened my pocket and stopped the machines and 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.959
 I took them to the roof of my house and 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.730
 I put them there in the deposit I said and now 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.830
 what do I do because I had a lot of 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.780
 orders to cover and I was scared because 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.489
 I had never had my own workshop or 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.220
 had gone to the workshops there was 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.959
 conversed with the cobblers but never 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.130
 I had my own workshop and I did not have 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.380
 the slightest idea of ​​what I was 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.900
 getting in but if he did not in that 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.210
 moment he did not he never opened a 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.640
 workshop in chorrillos 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.100
 owns the machines started all 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.120
 little but I already have I have machines 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.640
 own pass me flying around I went to 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.650
 I went to Caqueta and I asked for the 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.799
 salvador bridge stone 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.209
 everywhere I found shoemakers 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.299
 shoemakers there are in quantity but good 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.700
 shoemakers are very few every time I go 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.709
 to buy my materials generally 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.480
 all alone with a lot of people me 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.090
 they say hey, you're not afraid to put those 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.700
 dangerous places not the truth that no or 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.659
 be when you have a need and you have 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.670
 that go to work you go wherever 

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:36.819
 to get ahead the times to 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.980
 capital alone and very quiet with your 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.810
 list of things to make friends with your 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.400
 suppliers is super important because 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.300
 if you also give your providers that 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.920
 treat with affection 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.100
 and they will always try to give you the 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:52.410
 best product 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:55.380
 the shoes have not only led me to 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:57.240
 shoes videos but unintentionally 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.230
 inspired people to open their 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:00.120
 own businesses 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.460
 I had no idea what it inspired 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.380
 people making shoes write to me 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.530
 as if they were my close friends and I 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.790
 they write their problems inbox 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:14.200
 and they come to my studio and they say mariana 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.200
 thanks to you I opened my poultry 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:18.590
 I'll take the shoes too 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.260
 little friends got to study new things and 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.910
 that several feel in the place where 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:24.360
 I was before I was in my bed looking 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.060
 the chest 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.439
 and now they are nervous of wanting to open 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.449
 your own company but they will do it 

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:33.560
 because they realize that there are people 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.260
 who have been in the same position 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.270
 I'm going to tell the kids today 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:41.810
 Do what you want to do right now 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.530
 now your company do not be afraid is not 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:44.530
 difficult indeed
