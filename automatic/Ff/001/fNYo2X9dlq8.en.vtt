in<00:00:04.200> this<00:00:04.380> tutorial<00:00:04.620> we<00:00:05.279> will<00:00:05.400> demonstrate<00:00:05.580> how

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
in this tutorial we will demonstrate how

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.299 
in this tutorial we will demonstrate how
to<00:00:06.240> cut<00:00:06.569> sheet<00:00:06.839> glass<00:00:07.080> here<00:00:07.859> are<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.069> tools
