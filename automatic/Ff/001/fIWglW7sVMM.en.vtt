00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.980 
just haven't had that shut down game
where<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.189> expect<00:01:29.580> them<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.909> write<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.780> win

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
where you expect them to write to win

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.050 
where you expect them to write to win
and<00:01:31.229> they<00:01:31.320> just<00:01:31.470> go<00:01:31.619> out<00:01:31.770> and<00:01:31.799> do<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.100> last<00:01:32.759> week

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
and they just go out and do it last week

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.700 
and they just go out and do it last week
was<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> big<00:01:33.360> win<00:01:33.659> form<00:01:34.020> but<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.320> wasn't<00:01:34.590> one<00:01:34.680> of

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
was a big win form but it wasn't one of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.399 
was a big win form but it wasn't one of
those<00:01:34.830> wins<00:01:35.070> where<00:01:35.310> they<00:01:35.810> dominated<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
those wins where they dominated and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.649 
those wins where they dominated and
showed<00:01:37.740> me<00:01:37.770> anything<00:01:38.310> as<00:01:38.880> far<00:01:39.150> as<00:01:39.270> that<00:01:39.420> so

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
showed me anything as far as that so

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:40.969 
showed me anything as far as that so
Baltimore<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.140> still<00:01:40.380> thinks<00:01:40.590> one<00:01:40.710> of<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.829> best

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
Baltimore I still thinks one of the best

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.219 
Baltimore I still thinks one of the best
teams<00:01:41.159> in<00:01:41.250> the<00:01:41.310> AFC<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.079> obviously<00:01:43.079> one<00:01:43.200> of

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
teams in the AFC and obviously one of

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.090 
teams in the AFC and obviously one of
