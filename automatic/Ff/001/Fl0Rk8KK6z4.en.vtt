00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:16.519 
about $129 although I've seen them as

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:37.060 

this<00:00:34.879> definitely<00:00:35.300> will<00:00:36.079> cut<00:00:36.290> down<00:00:36.530> on<00:00:36.739> some<00:00:37.010> of

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
this definitely will cut down on some of

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.930 
this definitely will cut down on some of
the<00:00:37.309> arm<00:00:37.640> work<00:00:38.649> when<00:00:39.649> you're<00:00:39.770> doing<00:00:40.129> a<00:00:40.340> lot<00:00:40.640> of

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940

the arm work when you're doing a lot of
copper<00:00:41.360> work<00:00:43.059> for<00:00:44.059> the<00:00:44.149> video<00:00:44.390> I've<00:00:44.840> turned

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
copper work for the video I've turned

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.960 
copper work for the video I've turned
down<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.620> sound<00:00:45.949> on<00:00:46.460> the<00:00:46.820> machine<00:00:48.909> so<00:00:49.909> you

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:49.970 
down the sound on the machine so you

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.110 
down the sound on the machine so you
don't<00:00:50.210> hear<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:51.010> what<00:00:52.010> it<00:00:52.129> actually<00:00:52.430> sounds

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
don't hear it what it actually sounds

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.500 
don't hear it what it actually sounds
like<00:00:53.710> so<00:00:54.710> you<00:00:55.250> might<00:00:55.519> want<00:00:55.699> to<00:00:55.760> consider<00:00:56.120> using

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
like so you might want to consider using

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:02.410 
like so you might want to consider using
some<00:00:56.720> hearing<00:00:57.650> protection<00:01:00.399> for<00:01:01.399> 129<00:01:02.089> dollars

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
some hearing protection for 129 dollars

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
some hearing protection for 129 dollars
I'm<00:01:03.350> impressed<00:01:04.100> with<00:01:04.250> the<00:01:04.460> results<00:01:05.259> it's<00:01:06.259> not

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
I'm impressed with the results it's not

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.149 
I'm impressed with the results it's not
perfect<00:01:07.210> but<00:01:08.210> it<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.479> quite<00:01:08.990> good

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159

Harbor Freight calls these anvils and it

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.969 
Harbor Freight calls these anvils and it
comes<00:01:16.180> with<00:01:16.390> a<00:01:16.420> set<00:01:16.810> of<00:01:17.079> three<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.560> distance

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
comes with a set of three the distance

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.100
