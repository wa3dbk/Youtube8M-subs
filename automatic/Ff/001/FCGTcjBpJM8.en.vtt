gold camo on it so the g36c I've heard a

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.270 
gold camo on it so the g36c I've heard a
lot<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.259> people<00:00:13.410> say<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:13.889> it's<00:00:14.009> a<00:00:14.070> really

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
lot of people say that it's a really

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.010 
lot of people say that it's a really
underrated<00:00:14.610> assault<00:00:15.240> rifle<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.780> call<00:00:15.990> duty

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
underrated assault rifle in call duty

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.599 
underrated assault rifle in call duty
and<00:00:16.379> while<00:00:16.500> I<00:00:16.529> definitely<00:00:16.920> think<00:00:16.980> it's<00:00:17.160> really

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
and while I definitely think it's really

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.760 
and while I definitely think it's really
good<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.090> wouldn't<00:00:18.690> say<00:00:18.779> it's<00:00:18.930> underrated<00:00:19.260> I

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
good I wouldn't say it's underrated I

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.010 
good I wouldn't say it's underrated I
I'm<00:00:20.490> sure<00:00:20.760> plenty<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.240> people<00:00:21.330> use<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.810> at

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
I'm sure plenty of people use this at

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.540 
I'm sure plenty of people use this at
least<00:00:22.170> I<00:00:22.289> think<00:00:22.350> plenty<00:00:22.859> of<00:00:22.949> people<00:00:23.039> use<00:00:23.310> this

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
least I think plenty of people use this

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.490 
least I think plenty of people use this
I<00:00:23.850> use<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.539> quite<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.779> bit<00:00:24.960> myself

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
I use it quite a bit myself

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.490 
I use it quite a bit myself
and<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.920> find<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:27.240> only<00:00:27.630> downside<00:00:28.289> to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
and I find that the only downside to

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.040 
and I find that the only downside to
this<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.830> main<00:00:29.220> downside<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:30.029> the<00:00:30.420> recoil<00:00:30.869> and

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
this the main downside is the recoil and

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.930 
this the main downside is the recoil and
the<00:00:31.590> other<00:00:31.769> downside<00:00:32.040> would<00:00:32.460> probably<00:00:32.790> have

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
the other downside would probably have

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.490 
the other downside would probably have
to<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.510> second<00:00:33.960> boost<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.380> I<00:00:34.410> would

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
to be a second boost on so I would

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.430 
to be a second boost on so I would
probably<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.920> to<00:00:35.070> be<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.790> iron<00:00:36.719> sights<00:00:37.140> they

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
probably have to be the iron sights they

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.930 
probably have to be the iron sights they
are<00:00:37.620> pretty<00:00:38.010> difficult<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.550> use<00:00:38.700> in<00:00:38.730> my

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
are pretty difficult to use in my

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.510 
are pretty difficult to use in my
opinion<00:00:39.300> and<00:00:39.570> whoa<00:00:39.899> in<00:00:40.410> a<00:00:40.530> nice<00:00:40.829> rush<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.370> there
