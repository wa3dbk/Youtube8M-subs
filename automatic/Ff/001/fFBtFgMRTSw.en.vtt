behind<00:01:33.729> objects<00:01:34.299> it's<00:01:34.479> really<00:01:34.720> a<00:01:34.750> great<00:01:34.810> way

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
behind objects it's really a great way

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.590 
behind objects it's really a great way
for<00:01:35.290> us<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:36.310> introduce<00:01:36.700> a<00:01:37.030> lot<00:01:37.180> more<00:01:37.360> play

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
for us to introduce a lot more play

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.930 
for us to introduce a lot more play
mechanics<00:01:37.869> a<00:01:38.110> lot<00:01:38.290> new<00:01:38.520> kill<00:01:39.520> streets<00:01:39.790> and

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:39.940 
mechanics a lot new kill streets and

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.149 
mechanics a lot new kill streets and
technology<00:01:40.420> so<00:01:40.750> for<00:01:41.440> us<00:01:41.470> it<00:01:41.799> just<00:01:41.830> seemed<00:01:42.130> like

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
technology so for us it just seemed like

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.670 
technology so for us it just seemed like
a<00:01:42.310> natural<00:01:42.520> progression<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:43.270> go<00:01:43.540> to<00:01:43.600> 2025<00:01:44.260> but

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
a natural progression to go to 2025 but

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.230 
a natural progression to go to 2025 but
part<00:01:45.250> of<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:45.340> is<00:01:45.460> always<00:01:45.820> remember<00:01:46.210> that

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
part of that is always remember that

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.870 
part of that is always remember that
call<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.260> DS<00:01:47.440> always<00:01:47.680> about<00:01:47.979> plausible<00:01:48.430> what's

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
call of DS always about plausible what's

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.550 
call of DS always about plausible what's
real<00:01:49.119> what's<00:01:49.360> going<00:01:49.540> to<00:01:49.600> happen<00:01:49.900> so<00:01:50.080> we

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
real what's going to happen so we

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.039 
real what's going to happen so we
consulted<00:01:51.010> a<00:01:51.130> lot<00:01:51.369> of<00:01:51.549> people<00:01:51.820> to<00:01:52.210> say<00:01:52.420> what<00:01:52.960> is

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:53.049 
consulted a lot of people to say what is

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:54.600 
consulted a lot of people to say what is
technology<00:01:53.380> going<00:01:53.710> to<00:01:53.770> look<00:01:53.890> like<00:01:53.920> in<00:01:54.250> the

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:54.610 
technology going to look like in the

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.700 
technology going to look like in the
near<00:01:54.790> future<00:01:54.820> so<00:01:55.299> for<00:01:55.810> us<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:56.020> really<00:01:56.200> wasn't

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
near future so for us it really wasn't

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.950 
near future so for us it really wasn't
necessarily<00:01:57.159> this<00:01:57.400> huge<00:01:58.030> jump<00:01:58.360> to<00:01:58.510> the<00:01:58.600> future

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
necessarily this huge jump to the future

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.649 
necessarily this huge jump to the future
it<00:01:59.380> was<00:01:59.500> really<00:01:59.710> about<00:01:59.920> plausible<00:02:00.820> reality<00:02:01.570> of

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
it was really about plausible reality of

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.749 
it was really about plausible reality of
what<00:02:01.960> does<00:02:02.229> the<00:02:02.920> battlefield<00:02:03.400> going<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.610> look

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:03.759 
what does the battlefield going to look

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:06.840 
what does the battlefield going to look
like<00:02:03.790> in<00:02:04.150> the<00:02:04.360> next<00:02:04.659> 10<00:02:04.900> or<00:02:05.020> 15<00:02:05.320> years<00:02:05.850> bueno

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
like in the next 10 or 15 years bueno

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.160

yes<00:02:10.269> so<00:02:10.509> one<00:02:11.049> of<00:02:11.080> the<00:02:11.170> things<00:02:11.200> that<00:02:11.409> we're

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
yes so one of the things that we're

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.199 
yes so one of the things that we're
really<00:02:11.709> excited<00:02:11.980> about<00:02:12.220> multiplayer<00:02:12.760> is<00:02:13.060> this

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:13.209 
really excited about multiplayer is this

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:15.750 
really excited about multiplayer is this
new<00:02:13.390> concept<00:02:13.629> for<00:02:13.959> the<00:02:14.680> credit<00:02:14.859> class<00:02:15.129> of<00:02:15.310> 10

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
new concept for the credit class of 10

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.000 
new concept for the credit class of 10
so<00:02:16.359> in<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:16.749> past<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.200> traditionally<00:02:17.650> had<00:02:17.859> to

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
so in the past you traditionally had to

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.740 
so in the past you traditionally had to
have<00:02:18.159> a<00:02:18.189> primary

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
have a primary

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.200 
have a primary
or<00:02:19.020> secondary<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:20.340> three<00:02:20.640> perks<00:02:20.880> as<00:02:21.060> an

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
or secondary and three perks as an

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:22.940 
or secondary and three perks as an
example<00:02:21.510> with<00:02:21.780> equipment<00:02:22.050> but<00:02:22.620> this<00:02:22.800> time

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
example with equipment but this time

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.070 
example with equipment but this time
around<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.430> team<00:02:23.460> really<00:02:23.820> focused<00:02:24.270> on<00:02:24.390> why<00:02:25.020> is

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
around the team really focused on why is

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.870 
around the team really focused on why is
that<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.440> case<00:02:25.560> why<00:02:26.040> are<00:02:26.340> you<00:02:26.580> know<00:02:26.670> some<00:02:26.850> of

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that the case why are you know some of

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.280 
that the case why are you know some of
these<00:02:27.000> assumption<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.510> just<00:02:28.050> because

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
these assumption that just because

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.480 
these assumption that just because
you've<00:02:28.410> always<00:02:28.710> done<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:28.980> doesn't<00:02:29.370> mean

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
you've always done that doesn't mean

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.100 
you've always done that doesn't mean
that<00:02:29.520> that's<00:02:30.180> what<00:02:30.420> needs<00:02:30.630> to<00:02:30.750> happen<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:31.050> the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
that that's what needs to happen in the

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.110 
that that's what needs to happen in the
future<00:02:31.230> so<00:02:31.560> with<00:02:32.040> pick<00:02:32.280> 10<00:02:32.520> you<00:02:32.700> really<00:02:32.970> have

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
future so with pick 10 you really have

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.120 
future so with pick 10 you really have
the<00:02:33.240> opportunity<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.840> players<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.350> to<00:02:34.560> create

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.130 
the opportunity the players to to create

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.830 
the opportunity the players to to create
their<00:02:35.250> own<00:02:35.459> type<00:02:35.760> of<00:02:35.940> load<00:02:36.300> out<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:36.600> if<00:02:36.720> you

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
their own type of load out so if you

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.870 
their own type of load out so if you
want<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.170> be<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.500> running<00:02:38.190> gun<00:02:38.310> or<00:02:38.459> you<00:02:38.550> may<00:02:38.700> not

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
want to be a running gun or you may not

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.280 
want to be a running gun or you may not
want<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.209> second<00:02:39.540> during<00:02:39.630> you<00:02:39.780> don't<00:02:39.990> have<00:02:40.140> to

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
want a second during you don't have to

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.110 
want a second during you don't have to
take<00:02:40.410> that<00:02:40.470> or<00:02:40.860> you<00:02:41.340> want<00:02:41.520> some<00:02:41.670> additional

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
take that or you want some additional

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.690 
take that or you want some additional
grenade<00:02:42.420> so<00:02:42.630> really<00:02:42.870> allows<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.680> player<00:02:44.010> a<00:02:44.100> huge

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
grenade so really allows a player a huge

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.880 
grenade so really allows a player a huge
amount<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.090> opportunity<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.720> to<00:02:46.230> experiment

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
amount of opportunity to to experiment

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.290 
amount of opportunity to to experiment
with<00:02:46.920> different<00:02:47.100> load<00:02:47.400> outs<00:02:47.580> if<00:02:47.730> you<00:02:47.850> want<00:02:48.060> to

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
with different load outs if you want to

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.030 
with different load outs if you want to
just<00:02:48.900> have<00:02:49.080> a<00:02:49.110> knife<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:49.560> run<00:02:49.680> around<00:02:49.920> with

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
just have a knife and run around with

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.250 
just have a knife and run around with
six<00:02:50.250> perks<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.580> can<00:02:50.790> so<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.270> know<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:51.900> lot<00:02:52.230> of

six perks you can so you know a lot of

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.050 
six perks you can so you know a lot of
this<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.650> really<00:02:52.830> about<00:02:53.130> how<00:02:53.550> do<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.790> players

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
this is really about how do the players

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.580 
this is really about how do the players
want<00:02:54.360> to<00:02:54.420> play<00:02:54.540> multiplayer<00:02:54.900> and<00:02:55.170> experience

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590

on<00:03:11.010> in<00:03:11.280> this<00:03:11.459> creative<00:03:11.940> in<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.330> credit<00:03:12.660> class

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
on in this creative in the credit class

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.540 
on in this creative in the credit class
with<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:12.989> pic<00:03:13.230> 10<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.680> really<00:03:14.370> all<00:03:14.550> the

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:16.550 
with the pic 10 is really all the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.910 
with the pic 10 is really all the
attachments<00:03:17.550> all<00:03:18.000> of<00:03:18.150> the<00:03:18.270> things<00:03:18.450> that

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
attachments all of the things that

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.030 
attachments all of the things that
modify<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:19.950> gun<00:03:20.340> stay<00:03:21.060> on<00:03:21.330> the<00:03:21.540> gun<00:03:21.720> right<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:22.530> by

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
modify a gun stay on the gun right so by

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.680 
modify a gun stay on the gun right so by
doing<00:03:23.100> that<00:03:23.519> they're<00:03:23.730> able<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.209> if<00:03:24.420> you<00:03:24.510> think

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
doing that they're able to if you think

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.420 
doing that they're able to if you think
about<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.930> past<00:03:25.260> when<00:03:25.860> you<00:03:25.920> had<00:03:26.040> a<00:03:26.070> perk<00:03:26.310> that

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
about the past when you had a perk that

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.759 
about the past when you had a perk that
was<00:03:26.549> a<00:03:26.580> global<00:03:27.000> perk<00:03:27.180> that<00:03:27.360> maybe<00:03:27.680> you<00:03:28.680> were

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
was a global perk that maybe you were

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.030 
was a global perk that maybe you were
able<00:03:28.980> to<00:03:29.280> ats<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.269> little<00:03:30.570> bit<00:03:30.660> faster<00:03:30.840> or<00:03:31.230> swap

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
able to ats a little bit faster or swap

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.190 
able to ats a little bit faster or swap
weapons<00:03:32.430> that<00:03:32.549> was<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.700> global<00:03:33.330> thing<00:03:33.930> that

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
weapons that was a global thing that

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.900 
weapons that was a global thing that
went<00:03:34.440> across<00:03:34.650> all<00:03:34.980> weapons<00:03:35.489> so<00:03:35.580> if<00:03:35.670> a<00:03:35.760> weapon

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
went across all weapons so if a weapon

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.970 
went across all weapons so if a weapon
was<00:03:36.239> let's<00:03:36.930> say<00:03:37.049> already<00:03:37.500> a<00:03:37.620> little<00:03:37.799> bit

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
was let's say already a little bit

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.770 
was let's say already a little bit
faster<00:03:38.130> too<00:03:38.459> 80s<00:03:38.640> when<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.209> added<00:03:39.450> those

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
faster too 80s when you added those

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.960 
faster too 80s when you added those
perks<00:03:40.110> actually<00:03:40.799> increased<00:03:41.310> that<00:03:41.519> a<00:03:41.700> little

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
perks actually increased that a little

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.509 
perks actually increased that a little
bit<00:03:42.060> stronger<00:03:42.330> so<00:03:42.720> by<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.860> team<00:03:44.100> being<00:03:44.280> able

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
bit stronger so by the team being able

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.310 
bit stronger so by the team being able
to<00:03:44.610> go<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:44.940> look<00:03:45.060> at<00:03:45.269> each<00:03:45.480> individual<00:03:46.110> piece

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
to go and look at each individual piece

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.530 
to go and look at each individual piece
of<00:03:46.500> content<00:03:46.709> that<00:03:47.100> modifies<00:03:47.880> the<00:03:48.090> weapon<00:03:48.420> they

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
of content that modifies the weapon they

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.830 
of content that modifies the weapon they
can<00:03:48.690> actually<00:03:49.110> go<00:03:49.260> in<00:03:49.470> and<00:03:49.769> modify<00:03:50.370> how<00:03:51.090> that

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
can actually go in and modify how that

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.259 
can actually go in and modify how that
looks<00:03:52.110> in<00:03:52.260> the<00:03:52.380> how<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.340> gun<00:03:53.549> operates<00:03:54.090> and

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
looks in the how the gun operates and

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:56.440 
looks in the how the gun operates and
how<00:03:54.299> it<00:03:54.510> works<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:54.959> if<00:03:55.380> you<00:03:55.560> think<00:03:55.590> about

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
how it works so if you think about

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.729 
how it works so if you think about
steady<00:03:57.450> aim<00:03:57.630> as<00:03:57.780> an<00:03:57.930> example<00:03:58.230> used<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.590> be<00:03:58.709> a

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
steady aim as an example used to be a

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.650 
steady aim as an example used to be a
perk<00:03:59.010> now<00:03:59.610> it's<00:03:59.850> actually<00:04:00.030> a<00:04:00.209> weapon

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
perk now it's actually a weapon

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:01.910 
perk now it's actually a weapon
attachment<00:04:01.110> on<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.260> gun<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:01.680> you<00:04:01.769> actually

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
attachment on the gun so you actually

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.770 
attachment on the gun so you actually
see<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.730> in<00:04:02.880> the<00:04:03.000> environment<00:04:03.299> you<00:04:03.750> can

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
see it in the environment you can

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.220 
see it in the environment you can
actually<00:04:04.230> tune<00:04:04.709> those<00:04:05.040> particular<00:04:05.610> perks

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 
actually tune those particular perks

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.080 
actually tune those particular perks
excuse<00:04:07.230> me<00:04:07.350> attachments<00:04:08.220> directly<00:04:08.940> to<00:04:09.060> each

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
excuse me attachments directly to each

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:10.940 
excuse me attachments directly to each
gun<00:04:09.450> so<00:04:09.570> it<00:04:09.660> really<00:04:09.810> gives<00:04:09.870> the<00:04:10.140> team<00:04:10.260> a<00:04:10.320> great

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:10.950 
gun so it really gives the team a great

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:12.800 
gun so it really gives the team a great
way<00:04:11.070> of<00:04:11.100> being<00:04:11.340> able<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.610> balance<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.480> content

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
way of being able to balance the content

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.420 
way of being able to balance the content
uno<00:04:12.989> de<00:04:13.079> el<00:04:13.140> punto<00:04:13.320> fuerte<00:04:13.709> de<00:04:13.799> gallo<00:04:14.160> 2tb

llegando Elmo zombie que no VA a portent
an<00:04:16.950> omen<00:04:17.010> 3<00:04:17.340> yeah<00:04:17.820> so<00:04:18.030> I<00:04:18.239> don't<00:04:18.329> want<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.570> get

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
an omen 3 yeah so I don't want to get

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.210 
an omen 3 yeah so I don't want to get
too<00:04:18.840> far<00:04:19.049> you<00:04:19.380> know<00:04:19.470> too<00:04:19.530> involved<00:04:19.890> because<00:04:20.070> we

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
too far you know too involved because we

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.550 
too far you know too involved because we
want<00:04:20.400> the<00:04:20.519> story<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.850> unfold<00:04:21.690> for<00:04:22.049> offense<00:04:22.380> but

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
want the story to unfold for offense but

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.380 
want the story to unfold for offense but
two<00:04:22.860> things<00:04:23.100> that<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.280> think<00:04:23.340> really<00:04:23.550> stand<00:04:24.240> out

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
two things that I think really stand out

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.860 
two things that I think really stand out
for<00:04:24.600> the

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
for the

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.780 
for the
new<00:04:25.020> improvements<00:04:25.320> for<00:04:25.590> zombies<00:04:25.979> is<00:04:26.190> this

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
new improvements for zombies is this

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.810 
new improvements for zombies is this
idea<00:04:27.150> of<00:04:27.710> buildable<00:04:28.710> right<00:04:29.430> so<00:04:29.580> you'll<00:04:29.699> be

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
idea of buildable right so you'll be

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.210 
idea of buildable right so you'll be
able<00:04:29.940> to<00:04:30.090> go<00:04:30.300> out<00:04:30.540> and<00:04:30.750> there<00:04:31.410> may<00:04:31.560> be<00:04:31.590> items<00:04:32.070> in

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
able to go out and there may be items in

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.890 
able to go out and there may be items in
the<00:04:32.310> environment<00:04:32.580> they<00:04:32.850> can<00:04:33.060> actually<00:04:33.210> build

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
the environment they can actually build

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.200 
the environment they can actually build
things<00:04:34.229> together<00:04:34.470> build<00:04:35.040> different<00:04:35.220> two

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
things together build different two

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:38.450 
things together build different two
items<00:04:36.510> that<00:04:36.630> they<00:04:36.660> can<00:04:36.900> use<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:37.169> kill<00:04:38.070> more<00:04:38.340> and

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
items that they can use to kill more and

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.760 
items that they can use to kill more and
more<00:04:38.580> zombies<00:04:39.000> and<00:04:39.780> I<00:04:39.870> think<00:04:40.110> also<00:04:40.260> the<00:04:40.590> bus

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
more zombies and I think also the bus

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.219 
more zombies and I think also the bus
right<00:04:41.460> so<00:04:41.610> we've<00:04:41.729> added<00:04:41.910> this<00:04:42.120> bus<00:04:42.419> element

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:43.229 
right so we've added this bus element

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:44.300 
right so we've added this bus element
where<00:04:43.350> you<00:04:43.410> can<00:04:43.560> actually<00:04:43.680> take<00:04:43.979> the<00:04:44.130> bus

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
where you can actually take the bus

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.610 
where you can actually take the bus
around<00:04:44.550> the<00:04:44.729> map<00:04:44.940> it's<00:04:45.750> our<00:04:45.900> largest<00:04:46.110> zombie

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
around the map it's our largest zombie

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.830 
around the map it's our largest zombie
world<00:04:46.740> ever<00:04:47.040> so<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.060> bus<00:04:48.240> really<00:04:48.540> comes<00:04:48.720> in

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
world ever so the bus really comes in

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
lot of the innovation we've done a

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.520 
lot of the innovation we've done a
multiplayer<00:05:12.630> we<00:05:12.870> talked<00:05:13.080> about<00:05:13.199> a<00:05:13.289> lot<00:05:13.410> of<00:05:13.470> the

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
multiplayer we talked about a lot of the

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:14.950 
multiplayer we talked about a lot of the
innovation<00:05:13.710> that<00:05:14.100> we're<00:05:14.220> doing<00:05:14.310> zombies

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:14.960 
innovation that we're doing zombies

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.360 
innovation that we're doing zombies
single<00:05:15.960> player<00:05:16.050> is<00:05:16.229> no<00:05:16.350> no<00:05:16.680> exception<00:05:17.160> right

single player is no no exception right

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.879 
single player is no no exception right
so<00:05:17.639> we've<00:05:18.240> really<00:05:18.510> focused<00:05:18.720> on<00:05:19.020> a<00:05:19.260> handful<00:05:19.860> of

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
so we've really focused on a handful of

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.230 
so we've really focused on a handful of
different<00:05:20.220> things<00:05:20.400> for<00:05:20.550> the<00:05:20.610> single<00:05:21.150> player

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.240 
different things for the single player

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.180 
different things for the single player
as<00:05:21.479> far<00:05:21.660> as<00:05:21.780> some<00:05:22.289> of<00:05:22.380> the<00:05:22.440> new<00:05:22.590> innovations

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190 
as far as some of the new innovations

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.120 
as far as some of the new innovations
one<00:05:23.430> is<00:05:24.360> the<00:05:24.660> fact<00:05:25.530> that<00:05:25.590> you<00:05:25.740> can<00:05:25.889> create<00:05:26.039> a

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
one is the fact that you can create a

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.980 
one is the fact that you can create a
class<00:05:26.370> so<00:05:27.000> you<00:05:27.090> can<00:05:27.210> actually<00:05:27.300> create<00:05:27.600> a<00:05:27.750> class

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
class so you can actually create a class

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.170 
class so you can actually create a class
in<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:28.680> single-player<00:05:29.039> where<00:05:29.729> you<00:05:30.090> know

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
in the single-player where you know

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.180 
in the single-player where you know
you'll<00:05:30.360> be<00:05:30.419> given<00:05:30.810> a<00:05:30.870> default<00:05:31.229> setting<00:05:31.979> but<00:05:32.099> if

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:32.190 
you'll be given a default setting but if

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:34.640 
you'll be given a default setting but if
you<00:05:32.310> want<00:05:32.520> to<00:05:32.729> go<00:05:33.419> in<00:05:33.630> and<00:05:33.990> if<00:05:34.110> you're<00:05:34.380> more
