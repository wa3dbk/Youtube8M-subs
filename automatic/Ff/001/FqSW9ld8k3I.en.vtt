00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.909
 old 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.549
 but it was still worth a joke, right? 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.250

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.729
 greatly improved mishap does what the 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.170
 indy eyes but has done better 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.119
 recently catching a series of games 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.009
 classics and get some good stuff

 each of them to deliver a 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.479
 fun product without turning a salad 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.119
 no way can you see metal slug 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.220
 spew against and even a 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.479
 little miss this game you have 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.310
 What to walk and shoot? 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.899
 nothing complicated, not even the 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.459
 value the system starts to draw attention 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.400
 in the way the characters 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:17.290
 interact with the world instead of the child 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.019
 in a traditional of archivops today 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.940
 you have to jump where you want and 312 has 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.480
 a physics system programmed into it 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:24.970
 same 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.590
 the objects have future pulse weights one that 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.810
 it is not rare moments the player goes 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.970
 need to push a piece of wood to 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.340
 reach an item or die with the rock 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.230
 that fell on your head that physics that 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.140
 have to be realistic and can both 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.150
 irritate the other slug metal fans as 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.370
 may be the main buying factor here 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.350
 there are many things out of place but 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.570
 which functions as for example the system 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.730
 which was introduced with a 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.170
 giant globe is not every day you see 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.140
 this kind of thing 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:55.930
 in fact there are only wolves as well as robots 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.920
 which makes it a bit difficult to be registered 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.079
 by the chives 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.970
 besides the variety of wolves and robots 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:03.370
 there are different weapons that can be 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.260
 simultaneously loaded absolute 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.209
 National has had endless but it is well 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.430
 likely to spend most of 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.040
 time with the horrible machine guns 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.350
 laser that cross walls and 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.359
 punishments can end but it's difficult just 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:18.070
 10 totally uncontrolled 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:20.370
 I loved the mouse like 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.989
 soldati itself is one of these differentials 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.180
 precision balance and eliminates 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:27.400
 90's sensation that has to 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.410
 find the right spot on the screen and 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.959
 hold the control case diagonal 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.269
 to even mention an enemy hidden between 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.459
 today it does not exist, just drag the 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.260
 mouse pointer to wherever you want 

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:40.269
 are nine stages that should not take long 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.859
 too much to complete 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.260
 taking out the last boss that is for sure 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.890
 the next high point only in it 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.569
 were spent 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.569
 good development months 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.790
 between today 12 can certainly 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.890
 deliver a traditional form with a 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.660
 new clothes if you have the mind 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.420
 open to face this type of game 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.430
 with the mouse and not with the joystick it goes 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.709
 start any and is not one of those 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.780
 fanatics for generating these games without 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.060
