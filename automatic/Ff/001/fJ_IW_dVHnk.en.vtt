and<00:02:54.860> stuff<00:02:55.069> so<00:02:55.310> basically<00:02:55.849> what<00:02:56.239> this<00:02:56.390> is<00:02:56.660> is

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
and stuff so basically what this is is

it's a swamp ash body with a maple neck
neck<00:02:59.840> through<00:03:00.109> and<00:03:00.519> the<00:03:01.519> swamp<00:03:01.760> patch<00:03:01.910> makes

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
neck through and the swamp patch makes

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.020 
neck through and the swamp patch makes
it<00:03:02.329> incredibly<00:03:02.930> light<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.890> only<00:03:03.920> downside<00:03:04.849> is

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
it incredibly light the only downside is

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.030 
it incredibly light the only downside is
because<00:03:05.390> it's<00:03:05.540> a<00:03:05.599> seven<00:03:05.930> string<00:03:06.200> neck<00:03:06.530> is<00:03:06.769> that

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
because it's a seven string neck is that

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.789 
because it's a seven string neck is that
it<00:03:07.160> is<00:03:07.280> top-heavy<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:08.900> yeah<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.409> little<00:03:09.620> bit<00:03:09.680> of

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:09.799 
it is top-heavy so yeah a little bit of

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.920 
it is top-heavy so yeah a little bit of
neck<00:03:09.920> dive<00:03:10.129> on<00:03:10.400> that<00:03:10.579> so<00:03:10.849> a<00:03:11.299> little<00:03:11.659> bit<00:03:11.780> of<00:03:11.840> an

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
neck dive on that so a little bit of an

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.210 
neck dive on that so a little bit of an
issue<00:03:12.049> that<00:03:12.290> way<00:03:12.470> but<00:03:12.650> if<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:12.799> can<00:03:12.890> get<00:03:13.010> past

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
issue that way but if you can get past

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.030 
issue that way but if you can get past
that<00:03:13.400> the<00:03:13.700> thing<00:03:13.879> plays<00:03:14.269> fantastic<00:03:15.230> it's<00:03:15.769> I

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
that the thing plays fantastic it's I

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.039 
that the thing plays fantastic it's I
guess<00:03:16.250> you<00:03:16.459> would<00:03:16.640> best<00:03:17.269> compare<00:03:17.750> this<00:03:17.900> to

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:18.049 
guess you would best compare this to

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.960 
guess you would best compare this to
like<00:03:18.200> a<00:03:18.230> Schecter<00:03:18.709> Keith<00:03:19.220> marrow<00:03:19.519> 7

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
like a Schecter Keith marrow 7

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.399 
like a Schecter Keith marrow 7
considering<00:03:20.480> he<00:03:20.599> was<00:03:20.629> one<00:03:20.959> of<00:03:21.019> the<00:03:21.109> guys<00:03:21.200> who

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:21.409 
considering he was one of the guys who

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.099 
considering he was one of the guys who
helped<00:03:21.709> design<00:03:22.099> this<00:03:22.459> guitar<00:03:22.790> and<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.989> the

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
helped design this guitar and so the

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:25.599 
helped design this guitar and so the
neck<00:03:24.230> profile<00:03:24.650> is<00:03:24.829> pretty<00:03:25.069> much<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.370> same

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:25.609 
neck profile is pretty much the same

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:27.460 
neck profile is pretty much the same
it's<00:03:26.269> just<00:03:26.390> it's<00:03:26.720> not<00:03:26.810> a<00:03:26.870> compound<00:03:27.290> radius

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
it's just it's not a compound radius

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.259 
it's just it's not a compound radius
across<00:03:27.980> the<00:03:28.160> whole<00:03:28.250> thing<00:03:28.519> so<00:03:28.760> it's<00:03:28.940> just<00:03:29.090> like

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
across the whole thing so it's just like

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.479 
across the whole thing so it's just like
a<00:03:29.299> flat<00:03:29.840> same<00:03:30.260> woman<00:03:30.590> a<00:03:30.620> flat<00:03:30.859> radius<00:03:31.250> but<00:03:31.370> it's

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:31.489 
a flat same woman a flat radius but it's

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:34.449 
a flat same woman a flat radius but it's
the<00:03:31.579> same<00:03:31.730> radius<00:03:32.180> across<00:03:32.480> the<00:03:32.690> top<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.459> 26

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
the same radius across the top and 26

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.390 
the same radius across the top and 26
and<00:03:34.609> a<00:03:34.639> half<00:03:34.669> a<00:03:35.269> scale<00:03:35.840> length<00:03:36.109> so<00:03:36.400> basically

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
and a half a scale length so basically

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.770 
and a half a scale length so basically
yeah<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.090> makes<00:03:38.239> a<00:03:38.299> little<00:03:38.450> bit<00:03:38.540> easier<00:03:38.750> for

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
yeah it makes a little bit easier for

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.509 
yeah it makes a little bit easier for
the<00:03:38.930> lower<00:03:39.079> two<00:03:39.319> wings<00:03:39.530> makes<00:03:40.069> it<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.250> bit<00:03:40.370> more

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
the lower two wings makes it a bit more

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.220 
the lower two wings makes it a bit more
of<00:03:40.579> a<00:03:40.639> stretch<00:03:40.849> down<00:03:41.090> here<00:03:41.359> but<00:03:41.900> if<00:03:41.989> you<00:03:42.079> have

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
of a stretch down here but if you have

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:43.900 
of a stretch down here but if you have
long<00:03:42.470> fingers<00:03:42.859> like<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.129> do<00:03:43.190> it's<00:03:43.489> not<00:03:43.639> much<00:03:43.819> of

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:43.910 
long fingers like I do it's not much of

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.670 
long fingers like I do it's not much of
an<00:03:44.000> issue<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.419> as<00:03:44.690> an<00:03:44.780> added<00:03:44.989> bonus<00:03:45.230> people

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
an issue and as an added bonus people

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:46.839 
an issue and as an added bonus people
don't<00:03:45.799> think<00:03:45.859> about<00:03:46.069> it's<00:03:46.340> because<00:03:46.669> it's

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
don't think about it's because it's

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.030 
don't think about it's because it's
longer<00:03:47.120> it's<00:03:47.450> easier<00:03:47.750> to<00:03:47.840> get<00:03:47.959> up<00:03:47.989> here<00:03:48.440> for

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.040 
longer it's easier to get up here for

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.710 
longer it's easier to get up here for
all<00:03:49.160> that<00:03:49.340> lead<00:03:49.579> work<00:03:49.819> that<00:03:50.030> I<00:03:50.060> totally<00:03:50.540> don't

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
all that lead work that I totally don't

00:03:50.720 --> 00:04:09.640 
all that lead work that I totally don't
do<00:03:50.870> it<00:03:51.019> all

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.979 

other<00:04:10.370> things<00:04:10.549> includes<00:04:10.940> it's<00:04:11.330> all<00:04:11.480> Hipshot

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
other things includes it's all Hipshot

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:13.539 
other things includes it's all Hipshot
hardware<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:12.650> we<00:04:12.739> got<00:04:12.860> a<00:04:12.890> Hipshot<00:04:13.190> bridge

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
hardware so we got a Hipshot bridge

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:15.490 
hardware so we got a Hipshot bridge
there<00:04:13.849> which<00:04:14.090> actually<00:04:14.690> works<00:04:14.930> really<00:04:15.049> well

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:15.500 
there which actually works really well

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.740 
there which actually works really well
since<00:04:16.280> that<00:04:16.370> Kelly<00:04:16.790> bridges<00:04:17.239> are<00:04:17.359> typically

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
since that Kelly bridges are typically

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.960 
since that Kelly bridges are typically
quite<00:04:18.320> close<00:04:18.620> to<00:04:18.799> the<00:04:18.889> body<00:04:19.040> so<00:04:19.400> it's<00:04:19.579> exactly

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
quite close to the body so it's exactly

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.370 
quite close to the body so it's exactly
like<00:04:20.060> playing<00:04:20.479> a<00:04:20.570> tele<00:04:20.750> as<00:04:20.930> far<00:04:21.109> as<00:04:21.229> like<00:04:21.350> the

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
like playing a tele as far as like the

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.590 
like playing a tele as far as like the
field<00:04:21.680> goes<00:04:21.889> locking<00:04:22.760> tuners<00:04:22.970> as<00:04:23.240> well<00:04:23.419> too

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
field goes locking tuners as well too

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.540 
field goes locking tuners as well too
which<00:04:23.780> is<00:04:23.930> awesome<00:04:24.199> I've<00:04:24.800> always<00:04:25.370> loved

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:25.550 
which is awesome I've always loved

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.060 
which is awesome I've always loved
locking<00:04:25.880> tuners<00:04:26.229> control<00:04:27.229> setup<00:04:27.560> is<00:04:27.710> really

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070 
locking tuners control setup is really

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.310 
locking tuners control setup is really
nice<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.550> I'm<00:04:28.910> Kelly's<00:04:29.660> to<00:04:29.810> me<00:04:29.930> have<00:04:30.080> kind<00:04:30.260> of

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
nice the I'm Kelly's to me have kind of

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.350 
nice the I'm Kelly's to me have kind of
been<00:04:30.440> like<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:30.800> go-to<00:04:31.100> control<00:04:31.790> setup<00:04:32.120> just

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
been like the go-to control setup just

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.840 
been like the go-to control setup just
because<00:04:32.660> the<00:04:33.560> volume<00:04:33.979> and<00:04:34.280> like<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.520> controls

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850 
because the volume and like the controls

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:36.520 
because the volume and like the controls
are<00:04:34.970> far<00:04:35.180> enough<00:04:35.270> away<00:04:35.510> that<00:04:35.900> you<00:04:36.080> don't<00:04:36.110> worry

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:36.530 
are far enough away that you don't worry

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:38.050 
are far enough away that you don't worry
about<00:04:36.770> hitting<00:04:37.040> them<00:04:37.250> on<00:04:37.400> and<00:04:37.580> off<00:04:37.639> but

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
about hitting them on and off but

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.189 
about hitting them on and off but
they're<00:04:38.210> also<00:04:38.360> close<00:04:38.630> enough<00:04:38.870> that<00:04:38.900> you<00:04:39.020> can

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
they're also close enough that you can

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.750 
they're also close enough that you can
just<00:04:39.350> kind<00:04:39.470> of<00:04:39.530> grab<00:04:40.220> them<00:04:40.430> but<00:04:40.550> they're<00:04:40.669> not

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
just kind of grab them but they're not

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.490 
just kind of grab them but they're not
as<00:04:40.940> tight<00:04:41.240> in<00:04:41.270> as<00:04:41.510> a<00:04:41.540> strap<00:04:41.900> but<00:04:42.110> not<00:04:42.199> as<00:04:42.320> far

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:42.500 
as tight in as a strap but not as far

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.379 
as tight in as a strap but not as far
away<00:04:42.740> so<00:04:42.800> like<00:04:43.190> a<00:04:43.220> Les<00:04:43.520> Paul<00:04:43.550> type<00:04:43.940> setup<00:04:44.180> and

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
away so like a Les Paul type setup and

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.420 
away so like a Les Paul type setup and
yeah<00:04:45.169> switches<00:04:45.590> right<00:04:45.710> they're<00:04:45.979> really<00:04:46.310> easy

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
yeah switches right they're really easy

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.189 
yeah switches right they're really easy
to<00:04:46.580> hit<00:04:46.820> and<00:04:47.090> volumes<00:04:47.539> real<00:04:47.690> easy<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:48.020> hit

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:48.199 
to hit and volumes real easy to hit

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:50.050 
to hit and volumes real easy to hit
tones<00:04:48.740> not<00:04:48.919> that<00:04:49.100> far<00:04:49.280> back<00:04:49.490> are<00:04:49.699> there<00:04:49.850> and<00:04:49.970> of

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
tones not that far back are there and of

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.010 
tones not that far back are there and of
course<00:04:50.240> oil<00:04:50.479> split<00:04:51.289> not<00:04:51.500> a<00:04:51.530> tap<00:04:51.800> a<00:04:51.979> split<00:04:52.310> and

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
course oil split not a tap a split and

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.840 
course oil split not a tap a split and
yeah<00:04:54.020> all<00:04:54.260> really<00:04:54.530> easy<00:04:54.680> controls<00:04:55.190> to<00:04:55.340> grab<00:04:55.550> a

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:55.850 
yeah all really easy controls to grab a

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.600 
yeah all really easy controls to grab a
plays<00:04:56.750> great<00:04:57.229> wonderful<00:04:57.680> is<00:04:58.039> this<00:04:58.160> basically

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
plays great wonderful is this basically

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:01.330 
plays great wonderful is this basically
like<00:04:58.789> this<00:04:59.419> is<00:04:59.630> the<00:05:00.350> seventh<00:05:00.740> string<00:05:00.979> for<00:05:01.250> the

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
like this is the seventh string for the

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:03.939 
like this is the seventh string for the
guy<00:05:01.460> who<00:05:01.520> doesn't<00:05:02.000> want<00:05:02.210> to<00:05:02.479> play<00:05:02.630> metal<00:05:03.260> which

00:05:03.939 --> 00:05:03.949 
guy who doesn't want to play metal which

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:05.920 
guy who doesn't want to play metal which
I<00:05:04.310> mean<00:05:04.520> it<00:05:04.610> couldn't<00:05:05.030> obviously<00:05:05.479> do<00:05:05.600> metal<00:05:05.870> as

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
I mean it couldn't obviously do metal as

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.210 
I mean it couldn't obviously do metal as
you<00:05:06.050> heard<00:05:06.199> from<00:05:06.320> the<00:05:06.440> intro<00:05:06.650> song<00:05:06.860> I<00:05:07.070> did

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:07.220 
you heard from the intro song I did

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.920 
you heard from the intro song I did
there<00:05:07.400> with<00:05:07.580> a<00:05:07.610> little<00:05:07.729> demo<00:05:08.180> to<00:05:08.419> kind<00:05:08.570> of<00:05:08.630> run

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
there with a little demo to kind of run

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:11.170 
there with a little demo to kind of run
it<00:05:09.020> through<00:05:09.080> its<00:05:09.169> paces<00:05:09.289> oh<00:05:09.770> but<00:05:10.580> it's<00:05:10.820> just

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
it through its paces oh but it's just

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.480 
it through its paces oh but it's just
it's<00:05:11.479> like<00:05:11.840> it<00:05:12.320> doesn't<00:05:12.500> like<00:05:12.889> all<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.340> other
