00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
issues and I could say good news they

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.339 
issues and I could say good news they
really<00:02:10.590> did<00:02:10.950> work<00:02:11.370> hard<00:02:11.819> by<00:02:12.420> reducing<00:02:13.170> the

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
really did work hard by reducing the

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:15.320 
really did work hard by reducing the
stutters<00:02:13.799> big<00:02:14.220> time<00:02:14.549> at<00:02:14.700> least<00:02:14.940> from<00:02:15.120> my

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
stutters big time at least from my

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.100 
stutters big time at least from my
personal<00:02:15.750> experience<00:02:16.230> I<00:02:16.349> really<00:02:16.950> did<00:02:17.189> explore

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
personal experience I really did explore

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:19.990 
personal experience I really did explore
the<00:02:18.320> world<00:02:18.590> eight-ton<00:02:19.010> biggest<00:02:19.670> problem<00:02:19.940> I

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
the world eight-ton biggest problem I

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.660 
the world eight-ton biggest problem I
have<00:02:20.150> previously<00:02:20.750> before<00:02:20.990> patch<00:02:21.530> four<00:02:21.860> was

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
have previously before patch four was

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.130 
have previously before patch four was
every<00:02:23.090> single<00:02:23.330> time<00:02:23.480> you<00:02:23.630> went<00:02:23.780> to<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:23.930> new

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
every single time you went to a new

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.540 
every single time you went to a new
district<00:02:24.620> or<00:02:24.800> something<00:02:25.190> like<00:02:25.280> that

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:25.550 
district or something like that

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.750 
district or something like that
or<00:02:25.670> even<00:02:26.210> into<00:02:26.510> an<00:02:26.570> interior<00:02:26.960> of<00:02:27.350> a<00:02:28.100> very<00:02:28.400> large

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
or even into an interior of a very large

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.960 
or even into an interior of a very large
building<00:02:29.120> it<00:02:29.480> would<00:02:29.720> stutter<00:02:30.440> like<00:02:31.040> crazy<00:02:31.700> it

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
building it would stutter like crazy it

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.570 
building it would stutter like crazy it
was<00:02:32.120> horrible<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.500> then<00:02:33.650> also<00:02:33.830> that<00:02:34.130> greatly

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
was horrible and then also that greatly

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.880 
was horrible and then also that greatly
affected<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.270> controls<00:02:35.690> this<00:02:35.960> constant

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
affected the controls this constant

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.170 
affected the controls this constant
stutter<00:02:37.190> made<00:02:37.460> it<00:02:37.580> feel<00:02:37.760> like<00:02:37.880> you<00:02:38.150> were

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
stutter made it feel like you were

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.030 
stutter made it feel like you were
underwater<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.290> I<00:02:39.350> felt<00:02:39.560> like<00:02:39.650> something<00:02:39.890> was

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
underwater and I felt like something was

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.120 
underwater and I felt like something was
really<00:02:40.400> wrong<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:42.470> good<00:02:42.650> news<00:02:42.830> is

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.130 
really wrong and the good news is

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.600 
really wrong and the good news is
because<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:44.600> framerate<00:02:44.900> has<00:02:45.380> been<00:02:45.710> what<00:02:46.580> I

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
because the framerate has been what I

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.430 
because the framerate has been what I
would<00:02:46.820> consider<00:02:46.910> pretty<00:02:47.510> much<00:02:47.750> fixed<00:02:48.320> it

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
would consider pretty much fixed it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.530 
would consider pretty much fixed it
still<00:02:48.710> dips<00:02:49.130> every<00:02:49.460> now<00:02:49.610> and<00:02:49.760> again<00:02:49.790> but

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
still dips every now and again but

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.810 
still dips every now and again but
because<00:02:50.870> it<00:02:51.020> has<00:02:51.230> been<00:02:51.500> addressed<00:02:51.830> and<00:02:52.670> the

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
because it has been addressed and the

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.060 
because it has been addressed and the
performance<00:02:53.330> is<00:02:53.420> running<00:02:53.780> so<00:02:53.930> smoothly<00:02:54.290> that

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
performance is running so smoothly that

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.530 
performance is running so smoothly that
really<00:02:55.520> helps<00:02:55.820> with<00:02:55.910> the<00:02:55.970> controls<00:02:56.360> it

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
really helps with the controls it

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.140 
really helps with the controls it
finally<00:02:57.110> feels<00:02:57.440> like<00:02:57.560> a<00:02:57.890> proper<00:02:58.340> Assassin's

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
finally feels like a proper Assassin's

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.000 
finally feels like a proper Assassin's
Creed<00:02:59.390> game<00:02:59.570> so<00:02:59.810> that<00:03:00.110> is<00:03:00.290> really<00:03:00.620> good<00:03:00.770> news

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
Creed game so that is really good news

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.000 
Creed game so that is really good news
now<00:03:01.580> crowds<00:03:02.090> still<00:03:02.570> pop<00:03:02.960> in<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.500> they<00:03:03.590> shuffle

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
now crowds still pop in and they shuffle

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.260 
now crowds still pop in and they shuffle
their<00:03:04.160> clothing<00:03:04.580> I<00:03:04.640> think<00:03:04.910> that's<00:03:05.090> the

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270 
their clothing I think that's the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.210 
their clothing I think that's the
procedural<00:03:05.750> technology<00:03:06.410> at<00:03:06.500> work<00:03:06.710> it<00:03:06.890> really

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
procedural technology at work it really

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.070 
procedural technology at work it really
does<00:03:07.550> sort<00:03:07.790> of<00:03:07.910> remind<00:03:08.240> me<00:03:08.330> of<00:03:08.420> no<00:03:08.660> man's<00:03:08.960> sky

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
does sort of remind me of no man's sky

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:11.140 
does sort of remind me of no man's sky
when<00:03:09.500> we<00:03:09.590> see<00:03:09.740> the<00:03:09.890> trailers<00:03:10.280> of<00:03:10.790> no<00:03:10.970> man

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
when we see the trailers of no man

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.790 
when we see the trailers of no man
scaling<00:03:11.540> we<00:03:11.630> see<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:12.020> pop<00:03:12.260> pins<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.740> the

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
scaling we see the pop pins and the

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.380 
scaling we see the pop pins and the
procedural<00:03:13.220> technology<00:03:13.760> working<00:03:13.940> I<00:03:14.120> almost

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:14.390 
procedural technology working I almost

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.850 
procedural technology working I almost
think<00:03:14.870> that's<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.200> same<00:03:15.440> thing<00:03:15.680> that's

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
think that's the same thing that's

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.700 
think that's the same thing that's
happening<00:03:16.030> with<00:03:17.030> the<00:03:17.240> crowds<00:03:17.570> now<00:03:18.350> so<00:03:18.590> the

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:18.710 
happening with the crowds now so the

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:20.500 
happening with the crowds now so the
parkour<00:03:19.190> is<00:03:19.280> feeling<00:03:19.640> great<00:03:19.790> it's<00:03:20.210> way<00:03:20.480> more

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
parkour is feeling great it's way more

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.930 
parkour is feeling great it's way more

issues<00:03:27.830> both<00:03:28.040> good<00:03:28.400> news<00:03:28.700> I<00:03:29.000> got<00:03:29.209> online

migrating<00:03:38.840> this<00:03:39.680> was<00:03:39.860> really<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.220> true<00:03:40.459> test<00:03:40.790> of

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
migrating this was really a true test of

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:43.630 
migrating this was really a true test of
Ubisoft<00:03:41.390> servers<00:03:42.050> I<00:03:42.200> wanted<00:03:42.440> to<00:03:42.500> see<00:03:42.709> if<00:03:43.400> the

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
Ubisoft servers I wanted to see if the

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.880 
Ubisoft servers I wanted to see if the
game<00:03:43.820> would<00:03:44.000> actually<00:03:44.510> migrate<00:03:45.020> good<00:03:45.320> news<00:03:45.560> it

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
game would actually migrate good news it

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.460 
game would actually migrate good news it
did<00:03:46.220> but<00:03:46.790> unfortunately<00:03:46.940> after<00:03:47.690> that<00:03:48.080> things

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
did but unfortunately after that things

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.380 
did but unfortunately after that things
went<00:03:48.739> a<00:03:48.800> little<00:03:49.010> bit<00:03:49.310> downhill<00:03:49.580> the<00:03:50.180> AI

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
went a little bit downhill the AI

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.870 
went a little bit downhill the AI
started<00:03:51.110> lagging<00:03:51.320> behind<00:03:51.650> they<00:03:52.610> always

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
started lagging behind they always

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.400 
started lagging behind they always
seemed<00:03:53.060> like<00:03:53.239> they<00:03:53.390> were<00:03:53.450> trying<00:03:53.810> to<00:03:53.959> catch<00:03:54.170> up

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
seemed like they were trying to catch up

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.229 
seemed like they were trying to catch up
which<00:03:54.560> is<00:03:54.709> really<00:03:55.190> weird<00:03:55.370> about<00:03:55.580> SAS<00:03:55.970> creed

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
which is really weird about SAS creed

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.990 
which is really weird about SAS creed
unity<00:03:56.270> when<00:03:57.050> lack<00:03:57.350> happens<00:03:57.920> seems<00:03:58.700> like<00:03:58.880> it

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
unity when lack happens seems like it

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.150 
unity when lack happens seems like it
affects<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.570> AI<00:03:59.810> more<00:04:00.350> than<00:04:00.500> anything<00:04:00.890> they

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
affects the AI more than anything they

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.490 
affects the AI more than anything they
seem<00:04:01.400> to<00:04:01.550> be<00:04:01.700> really<00:04:01.970> struggling<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:03.140> find<00:04:03.320> out

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 
seem to be really struggling to find out

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.290 
seem to be really struggling to find out
what's<00:04:03.800> really<00:04:04.040> happening<00:04:04.610> in<00:04:04.730> front<00:04:05.030> of<00:04:05.120> them

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
what's really happening in front of them

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.510 
what's really happening in front of them
but<00:04:05.989> I<00:04:06.020> it<00:04:06.290> was<00:04:06.350> unfortunate<00:04:07.070> that<00:04:07.160> that<00:04:07.340> did

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
but I it was unfortunate that that did

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.040 
but I it was unfortunate that that did
happen<00:04:07.850> I<00:04:07.910> hope<00:04:08.150> they<00:04:08.360> get<00:04:08.540> that<00:04:08.600> fixed

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
happen I hope they get that fixed

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.290 
happen I hope they get that fixed
because<00:04:09.170> that<00:04:09.410> does<00:04:09.680> happen<00:04:09.709> on<00:04:10.700> occasion

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:11.300 
because that does happen on occasion

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.300 
because that does happen on occasion
in<00:04:11.480> disaster<00:04:11.959> you<00:04:12.110> can<00:04:12.380> win<00:04:12.620> playing<00:04:12.890> on<00:04:13.070> home

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
in disaster you can win playing on home

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.190 
in disaster you can win playing on home
so<00:04:13.760> about<00:04:14.060> path<00:04:14.360> for<00:04:14.690> you're<00:04:14.989> probably

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
so about path for you're probably

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.740 
so about path for you're probably
wondering<00:04:15.709> is<00:04:15.950> the<00:04:16.190> game<00:04:16.430> now<00:04:16.850> officially

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
worth it do you think I should get

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.180 
worth it do you think I should get
