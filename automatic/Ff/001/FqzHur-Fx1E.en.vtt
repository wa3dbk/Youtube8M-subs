00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.390
 Nagato Daiko Old-President makes use speed faster 

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.079
 This year 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.869
 Position the patent 

00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:15.119
 I will 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:18.119
 You have an eco bag 

00:00:19.239 --> 00:00:22.130
 I use a magnet magnet 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.009
 2 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:26.880
 Like this 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.099
 It's a small example 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.289
 609 yen 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.900
 I am preparing 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.400
 As a household 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.720
 By the power of that magnet 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.720
 Host school 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.440
 The mourner is here 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.170
 Although it is adsorbed and attached 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:51.300
 I am running 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.620
 It was the best ever 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.930
 Pickup 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.930
 Stick with double-sided tape on both sides 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.580
 Sticky agreement 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.140
 Fix using adhesive tape 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.980
 It was not too bad 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.470
 Very inconvenient 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.230
 However, it has been hard to buy such a thing to put out 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.070
 I had never been able to get 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.200
 But this is 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
 Arriving near arrival 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.850
 There is no longer a price range 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.850
 But 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.490
 so 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.800
 Endeavor 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.390
 But soon 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.730
 Absolute failure 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.920
 It is US patent application principle 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.240
 English Saga 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.920
 eco brain 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.500
 Say that the book is off 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.690
 For example, I was told 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.720
 In any way 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.140
 I heard, for example 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:52.320
 on the other hand 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.320
 Such environment 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.600
 Something like this 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.440
 Each one 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:00.750
 It's rough 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.000
 Remove 4 pieces and include both sides tax 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.370
 Receded 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.000
 Search 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.279
 From next month 

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:13.649
 Any song can be freely attached at last. 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:14.129
 Exposed
