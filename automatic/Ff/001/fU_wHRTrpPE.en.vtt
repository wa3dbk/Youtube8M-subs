00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
an airframe and powerplant and we also

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.590 
an airframe and powerplant and we also
offer<00:00:37.050> a<00:00:37.260> degree<00:00:37.850> it's<00:00:38.850> an<00:00:39.030> associate<00:00:39.540> of

offer a degree it's an associate of
applied<00:00:39.930> science<00:00:40.070> it's<00:00:41.070> 15<00:00:42.000> hours<00:00:42.540> of<00:00:42.570> general

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
applied science it's 15 hours of general

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.170 
applied science it's 15 hours of general
studies<00:00:43.350> beyond<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.579> airframe<00:00:45.090> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
studies beyond the airframe and

powerplant<00:00:45.480> curriculum<00:00:47.480> the<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.170> way<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
powerplant curriculum the the way the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
powerplant curriculum the the way the
program<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.890> set<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:51.649> it's<00:00:52.649> very<00:00:52.860> well<00:00:53.219> set

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
program is set up is it's very well set

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.299 
program is set up is it's very well set
up<00:00:53.489> it's<00:00:53.789> actually<00:00:54.180> broken<00:00:54.360> down<00:00:54.719> into<00:00:55.309> what

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
up it's actually broken down into what

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.580 
up it's actually broken down into what
you<00:00:56.489> need<00:00:56.730> and<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.600> if<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.840> only<00:00:57.989> want<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.440> do

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
you need and so if you only want to do

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.950 
you need and so if you only want to do
part<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.640> your<00:00:59.760> program<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.449> actually<00:01:00.660> do

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
part of your program you can actually do

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.329 
part of your program you can actually do
just<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.469> part<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:01.829> program<00:01:02.780> it's<00:01:03.780> also

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
just the part of the program it's also

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.649 
just the part of the program it's also
set<00:01:05.339> up<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.700> if<00:01:05.850> you're<00:01:06.000> going<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.600> a

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
set up so that if you're going for a

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.810 
set up so that if you're going for a
degree<00:01:07.439> like<00:01:07.650> an<00:01:07.770> associate<00:01:08.189> degree<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.640> can

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
degree like an associate degree you can

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.580 
degree like an associate degree you can
actually<00:01:08.970> do<00:01:09.330> that<00:01:09.360> as<00:01:09.810> part<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.229> program

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
actually do that as part of the program

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.359 
actually do that as part of the program
also<00:01:10.909> a<00:01:12.049> lot<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.200> other<00:01:13.320> places<00:01:13.650> they<00:01:14.100> kind<00:01:14.310> of

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
also a lot of other places they kind of

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.740 
also a lot of other places they kind of
mix<00:01:14.610> things<00:01:14.850> up<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.270> you're<00:01:15.390> never<00:01:15.479> really

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
mix things up so you're never really

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.810 
mix things up so you're never really
done<00:01:16.560> with<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.950> chunk<00:01:17.220> until<00:01:17.580> you're<00:01:17.700> done

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
done with the chunk until you're done

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.310 
done with the chunk until you're done
with<00:01:18.030> all<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.450> so<00:01:18.720> it's<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.200> less

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
with all of it so it's a little less

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.350 
with all of it so it's a little less
convenient

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
convenient

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.690 
convenient
since<00:01:21.200> we<00:01:21.380> are<00:01:21.530> an<00:01:21.650> faa<00:01:21.950> certified<00:01:22.610> school<00:01:23.620> we

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:24.700 
since we are an faa certified school we

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.240 
since we are an faa certified school we
need<00:01:25.700> to<00:01:25.850> offer<00:01:26.500> we<00:01:27.500> need<00:01:27.680> to<00:01:27.770> offer<00:01:27.920> courses

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
need to offer we need to offer courses

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.990 
need to offer we need to offer courses
in<00:01:28.490> three<00:01:28.970> areas<00:01:29.470> general<00:01:30.470> courses<00:01:31.340> are<00:01:31.610> for

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
in three areas general courses are for

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.050 
in three areas general courses are for
any<00:01:32.480> mechanic<00:01:33.200> it's<00:01:33.380> the<00:01:33.590> basics<00:01:34.040> is<00:01:34.250> math<00:01:34.640> its

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
any mechanic it's the basics is math its

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.560 
any mechanic it's the basics is math its
basic<00:01:35.570> electricity<00:01:35.990> it's<00:01:36.410> like<00:01:36.620> that<00:01:37.570> once

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
basic electricity it's like that once

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.620 
basic electricity it's like that once
the<00:01:39.050> once<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:39.680> have<00:01:39.890> those<00:01:40.070> down<00:01:40.460> then<00:01:41.180> we<00:01:41.420> go

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
the once you have those down then we go

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.260 
the once you have those down then we go
to<00:01:41.660> airframe<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:42.770> in<00:01:43.310> airframe<00:01:43.760> we<00:01:43.910> start<00:01:44.180> off

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
to airframe and in airframe we start off

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.700 
to airframe and in airframe we start off
with<00:01:44.450> structures<00:01:44.840> so<00:01:45.080> you'll<00:01:45.229> be<00:01:45.380> working

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
with structures so you'll be working

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.130 
with structures so you'll be working
with<00:01:45.740> sheet<00:01:46.100> metal<00:01:46.130> and<00:01:46.550> you'll<00:01:46.700> be<00:01:46.990> we<00:01:47.990> do

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
with sheet metal and you'll be we do

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.140 
with sheet metal and you'll be we do
have<00:01:48.260> a<00:01:48.320> welding<00:01:48.830> course<00:01:49.130> we<00:01:49.640> have<00:01:49.729> a<00:01:49.790> woods

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
have a welding course we have a woods

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.609 
have a welding course we have a woods
course<00:01:51.100> and<00:01:52.100> those<00:01:52.400> and<00:01:53.020> once<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.410> are

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
course and those and once you are

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.020 
course and those and once you are
finished<00:01:54.800> with<00:01:55.100> the<00:01:55.220> structures<00:01:55.700> then<00:01:55.910> we

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
finished with the structures then we

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.760 
finished with the structures then we
move<00:01:56.210> into<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.690> system<00:01:57.140> so<00:01:57.410> you'll<00:01:57.650> be

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
move into the system so you'll be

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.370 
move into the system so you'll be
working<00:01:57.800> with<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:59.210> electrical<00:01:59.720> systems<00:02:00.140> the

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
working with the electrical systems the

you<00:02:07.820> will<00:02:07.850> be<00:02:08.390> finished<00:02:08.840> with<00:02:09.080> airframe<00:02:09.530> and

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
you will be finished with airframe and

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.110 
you will be finished with airframe and
you<00:02:09.770> can<00:02:09.920> test<00:02:10.130> and<00:02:10.429> get<00:02:10.550> your<00:02:10.700> airframe
