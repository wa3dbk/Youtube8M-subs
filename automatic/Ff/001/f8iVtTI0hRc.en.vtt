00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
you know i think it was you know because

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.040 
you know i think it was you know because
she<00:00:17.130> had<00:00:17.279> had<00:00:17.460> such<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.820> little<00:00:18.210> exposure<00:00:18.720> on

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
she had had such a little exposure on

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.620 
she had had such a little exposure on
the<00:00:19.230> public<00:00:19.710> stage<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.490> thought<00:00:21.390> it<00:00:21.539> was

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
the public stage I thought it was

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.840 
the public stage I thought it was
important<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.380> find<00:00:22.710> out<00:00:22.980> where<00:00:23.369> she<00:00:23.580> stood

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
important to find out where she stood

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.240 
important to find out where she stood
politically<00:00:24.630> what<00:00:25.199> kind<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:26.060> policy

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:28.250 
politically what kind of policy

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.479 
politically what kind of policy
positions<00:00:29.250> she<00:00:29.640> supported<00:00:30.800> she<00:00:31.800> had<00:00:31.890> bent<00:00:32.099> at

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
positions she supported she had bent at

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.060 
positions she supported she had bent at
the<00:00:32.550> UN<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.180> day<00:00:33.660> so<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:34.170> opened<00:00:34.590> up<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.860> door

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
the UN that day so it opened up the door

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.799 
the UN that day so it opened up the door
to<00:00:35.100> ask<00:00:35.399> her<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> lot<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:36.030> foreign<00:00:36.329> policy

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
to ask her a lot of foreign policy

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.799 
to ask her a lot of foreign policy
questions<00:00:37.350> and<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:38.610> really<00:00:39.030> just<00:00:39.059> wanted<00:00:39.600> to

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
questions and I really just wanted to

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.200 
questions and I really just wanted to
see<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:41.100> know<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.610> learn<00:00:41.820> more<00:00:42.180> about

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
see you know just to learn more about

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.930 
see you know just to learn more about
her<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.829> questions<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.370> came<00:00:44.670> up<00:00:44.910> with

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
her and so the questions I came up with

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.690 
her and so the questions I came up with
I<00:00:45.539> thought<00:00:46.110> would<00:00:46.350> indicate<00:00:46.770> kind<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
I thought would indicate kind of a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.850 
I thought would indicate kind of a
position<00:00:48.420> accumulated<00:00:49.140> knowledge<00:00:49.410> and

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
position accumulated knowledge and

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.160 
position accumulated knowledge and
ability<00:00:50.430> to<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.879> a<00:00:50.910> critical<00:00:51.360> thinker<00:00:51.420> right

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
ability to be a critical thinker right

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.380 
ability to be a critical thinker right
and<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:53.129> took<00:00:53.370> some<00:00:53.969> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.149> most<00:00:54.270> pressing

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
and I took some of the most pressing

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.770 
and I took some of the most pressing
issues<00:00:55.050> of<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.920> time<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.550> tried<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> fashion

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
issues of the time and tried to fashion

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.450 
issues of the time and tried to fashion
questions<00:00:58.199> about<00:00:58.530> them<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.980> would<00:00:59.070> elicit

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
questions about them that would elicit

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.420 
questions about them that would elicit
answers<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.690> would<00:01:00.840> be<00:01:01.230> revealing<00:01:01.949> right

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
answers that would be revealing right

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.630 
answers that would be revealing right
and<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.239> that's<00:01:03.600> what<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:03.899> did<00:01:03.989> and<00:01:04.460> made<00:01:05.460> you

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
and so that's what I did and made you

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.760 
and so that's what I did and made you
think<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.030> say<00:01:06.299> what<00:01:06.869> do<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.049> read<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.680> know

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
think to say what do you read you know

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.260 
think to say what do you read you know
that<00:01:07.979> was<00:01:08.159> totally<00:01:08.549> off<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.700> cuff<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.180> it

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
that was totally off the cuff and it

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.880 
that was totally off the cuff and it
always<00:01:09.450> makes<00:01:09.810> me<00:01:09.990> laugh<00:01:10.020> that<00:01:10.229> that's<00:01:10.619> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
always makes me laugh that that's the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.490 
always makes me laugh that that's the
question<00:01:11.130> people<00:01:11.670> so<00:01:11.880> member<00:01:12.240> nadine<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:13.049> was

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
question people so member nadine I was

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200 
question people so member nadine I was
just<00:01:13.650> interested<00:01:14.010> because<00:01:14.640> she<00:01:14.820> was<00:01:14.970> very

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
just interested because she was very

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.749 
just interested because she was very
very<00:01:15.960> entrenched<00:01:16.920> in<00:01:17.189> her<00:01:17.400> particular

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
very entrenched in her particular

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.300 
very entrenched in her particular
political<00:01:18.390> views<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.350> somebody<00:01:19.680> you

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
political views just as somebody you

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.370 
political views just as somebody you
know<00:01:20.430> who<00:01:20.640> was<00:01:20.790> extremely<00:01:21.540> left-wing<00:01:22.080> might

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
know who was extremely left-wing might

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.590 
know who was extremely left-wing might
be<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:23.280> know<00:01:23.430> and<00:01:23.670> she<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:23.850> quite

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
be you know and she was quite

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510 
be you know and she was quite
conservative<00:01:25.020> in<00:01:25.470> many<00:01:25.680> respects<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.310> I<00:01:26.369> was

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
conservative in many respects and I was

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.990 
conservative in many respects and I was
just<00:01:26.700> wondering<00:01:27.150> what<00:01:27.479> shaped<00:01:27.990> her<00:01:28.259> political

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 
just wondering what shaped her political

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.899 
just wondering what shaped her political
philosophy<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:31.470> thought<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.430> was<00:01:32.759> an

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
philosophy and I thought that was an

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.940 
philosophy and I thought that was an
interesting<00:01:33.000> question<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.869> say<00:01:34.049> what<00:01:34.380> what

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
interesting question to say what what

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.740 
interesting question to say what what
was<00:01:35.159> what<00:01:35.400> could<00:01:35.729> because<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.150> think<00:01:36.210> we're<00:01:36.600> all

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
was what could because I think we're all

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.200 
was what could because I think we're all
influenced<00:01:37.470> my<00:01:37.680> other<00:01:38.100> opinions<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.119> the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
influenced my other opinions and the

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.450 
influenced my other opinions and the
things<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.659> read<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.979> know<00:01:41.100> that's<00:01:41.310> why

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
things we read and you know that's why

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.460 
things we read and you know that's why
it's<00:01:41.610> important<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.450> read<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.020> lot<00:01:43.290> of

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
it's important I think to read a lot of

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.569 
it's important I think to read a lot of
different<00:01:43.500> things<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.250> get<00:01:44.369> different

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
different things to get different

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.609 
different things to get different
