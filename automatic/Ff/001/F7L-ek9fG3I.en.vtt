00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.420
 a while ago he got in touch with 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.190
 us pepe garcÃ­a lopez author of 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.350
 game that I have in my hands at 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.810
 balester a game as he tells us here of 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.860
 Medieval battles table is a game 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:20.169
 in which we will have to face 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.739
 different soldiers a kind of war 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:25.360
 game between quotation marks in quotes 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:28.270
 but that will allow to play and this is one 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.980
 of its most advantageous points between 2 and 4 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.989
 players and that also has a 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.239
 Simple mechanics to understand and curious 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.640
 to see since the game tells us that 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.589
 contains six sections and a lot of 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.390
 soldiers and when we open the box we 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.120
 we found that there are a lot of 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.699
 we give because the soldiers are given 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.739
 corpses treated in a very very way 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.269
 interesting to be able to mark life in 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.000
 every moment we will see how it works 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:53.740
 this esther tree 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.620
 arval esther proposes us a board of 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.880
 four wings with a kind of field of 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.850
 battle 'drawn with a grid 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.830
 grid two decks of letters letters 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.650
 battle attack cards with letter 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:06.910
 standard and six sides tells us the manual 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.700
 in terms of its content and then we 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.760
 says there are 26 units of each color 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.520
 in four colors green gray red and 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.440
 yellow inside the box but 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.180
 really what we find inside 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.460
 the box inside a super crib by 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:26.280
 true is a lot of degrees 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.560
 so it 's bad of the six dice or 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.299
 is wrong or the units really do not 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.700
 it's wrong neither one thing nor the other is that 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.979
 in arba lester the units are given 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.770
 here I have this example I'm going to take out the 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.109
 red dice and green dice 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.759
 what are the units of the red player and 

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.649
 of the green player that each will start 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.539
 in a corner these games have a 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.369
 peculiarity and a particularity and those 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.259
 special soldiers as you see that 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.560
 represent the types of troops we 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.600
 approached a little we have the gentlemen 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.110
 that come with a horseshoe we have a 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.259
 the clerics who will heal we have the 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.049
 warriors the soldiers on foot have 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:10.679
 to the spearmen that go with a kind 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:14.239
 from to the beard we have the archers 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.239
 we have the crossbowmen 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:19.180
 and we thieves or jokes 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.820
 well because there is only one and finally 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.340
 we will have the army leader to 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.830
 these are all the types of troops that 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.360
 It has a website that I miss the spear all 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.670
 the types of troops that have trees 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.010
 they have the colors but fort we want 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.860
 because each of the slaves will have 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.150
 they all have the same face that is 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.490
 type of unit but it has different 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:44.260
 number is the number that goes from 5 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:46.360
 up to 30 represents the life of the 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.220
 unit no unit may have more than 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.200
 30 of life none opposed to have 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.990
 less than 5 because they will die and the damage 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.270
 They go from 5 to 5 so players 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:56.620
 they will have to mount their army would lead 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.970
 also a little peculiar there are several 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.550
 game modes in the manual in the mode 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.830
 basic we will have a unit of 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.990
 each type and they will start with the life that 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:09.160
 indicates here for example 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.650
 10 out of 15 one crossbowman out of 15 so 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.720
 we put the dice by the lake 15 a 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.720
 knight or cavalry of 20 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.870
 a cleric of 15 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.530
 a warrior of 15 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.439
 in the rom of 15 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.910
 archers of 10 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.680
 and finally to the army leader who 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.380
 You may be the type we want that 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.760
 want with 25 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.370
 we have to make clear from the 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.380
 principle which is our leader and by 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.090
 course the green for the same in your 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.460
 side did not put them here anymore and the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.230
 questions that were covered with 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.080
 different types that is can be 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:59.360
 choose four soldiers of any 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.090
 type except gentlemen can be 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.400
 choose two soldiers and a gentleman or 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.540
 they can choose two gentlemen and they 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.060
 will cover the questions we are going to 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.260
 leaving them aside during the shift is 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.420
 very easy 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.870
 each player choose one of their 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:17.600
 soldiers throw two sides or three if it is 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.980
 the gentleman to move move to those 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.049
 boxes can not be moved diagonally 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.190
 except the thief and they will see it for example 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.750
 if we are going to choose the halberdiers 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:28.730
 Well, we can move 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 and 8 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.040
 because as I say you can not move in 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.910
 diagonal and then you can attack if there is 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.220
 someone in your attack range 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:36.630
 okay, it does not have more than this, we move and 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.640
 we attack with all the soldiers and then 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.280
 the opposing player at the end of each 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.620
 turn will take a battle card and 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.720
 if we have also attacked and killed some 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:48.180
 rival will also take a letter from 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:49.650
 turn and attack will be resolved 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:52.440
 the cards that can stay on the table 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.880
 or be saved as equipment etcetera for him 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.190
 it does not have much more than this the 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.870
 attacks is the only thing that's missing come from 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.730
 a little defined by the type of unit 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.800
 action the manual we have a small 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.960
 chop that tells us what the arch of 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.350
 attack because not everyone attacks the same 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.690
 example a warrior can attack a to 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.730
 another rival that is adjacent to him but 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:13.290
 A dry dock wing can not attack a steel 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.510
 you can not attack an adjacent one you have to 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.360
 have a gap as it attacks let's say like 

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.890
 one away and there are some 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:22.260
 caveats for example the archers are 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.540
 the only ones that will be able to attack through 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.760
 other units or the knights by 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:28.080
 example they will be able to load with which they move 

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.850
 more and if the result is high they can 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.860
 do more damage the army leader 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.050
 You have special skills like 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.810
 example attack twice the attacks are 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.190
 singles is attacked with a die is thrown 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:40.289
 a dice if this halberdier is going to attack 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:44.490
 this soldier 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:47.039
 in a result of 2 to 5, 10 are made 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.689
 points but 5 points of damage for giving 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:54.379
 if he was at 30 and we have taken out 

00:05:48.689 --> 00:05:54.379
 example a 5 then he stayed at 25 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:00.749
 if we do if we have taken a 1 there is no 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:03.209
 damage and if we have spoken as weird nor a 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:06.980
 6 we do 10 points of damage so if 

00:06:03.209 --> 00:06:09.380
 I was in 30 really will stay in 20 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.870
 so when it reaches zero it will be removed from the 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:13.880
 battlefield terrain as I say 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.710
 all have special abilities the 

00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:19.280
 priests will cure for example may 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:21.650
 give life never more than 30 the 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:24.080
 thieves will be able to steal team letters to 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:26.360
 the rivals and as I say they all have 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:27.950
 some special skill like this will follow 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.390
 playing until it's only in 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.250
 principle a winner although there is like 

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.590
 I say several game modes and as you can see 

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:35.630
 allows you to play up to 4 players in this 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.430
 battle by the way you can not go through 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:39.960
 the water squares 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.970
 if you want to show that we are the 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:43.740
 best on the battlefield without 

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:45.900
 doubt arba lester is one more than 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:49.200
 recommendable option in addition to be able 

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:50.940
 play 2 3 and 4 players as you have 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.920
 seen dice to mark us 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.870
 soldiers and their life in a very 

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.940
 simple very easy to see from then on 

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:59.040
 first of first sight and with some 

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:01.590
 mechanical very simple to understand but 

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.630
 that we will also have to give it a little 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:05.460
 of time to master the a see 

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.620
 if we show that we are the best 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:09.720
 from here our thanks to pepe 

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.400
 garcÃ­a lopez for sending us this copy 

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:14.480
 and we will dedicate the time that 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.480
 deserves this great game
