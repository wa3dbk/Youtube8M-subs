out of this and show you exactly how to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.240 
out of this and show you exactly how to
add<00:01:00.420> your<00:01:00.570> own<00:01:00.629> batteries<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.829> the<00:01:01.920> motorized

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
add your own batteries so the motorized

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.429 
add your own batteries so the motorized
system<00:01:02.550> also<00:01:02.879> brings<00:01:03.180> an<00:01:03.390> L<00:01:03.750> wrench<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.260> then

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
system also brings an L wrench and then

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.020 
system also brings an L wrench and then
we<00:01:04.739> have<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.129> four<00:01:05.309> screws<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.580> are<00:01:05.729> going

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
we have the four screws that are going

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.510 
we have the four screws that are going
to<00:01:06.090> be<00:01:06.210> needed<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.540> attach<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.290> cover<00:01:08.189> block

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
to be needed to attach the cover block

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.520 
to be needed to attach the cover block
to<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.360> base<00:01:09.510> plate<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:10.020> needs<00:01:10.170> to<00:01:10.260> be<00:01:10.350> done

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
to the base plate so it needs to be done

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.960 
to the base plate so it needs to be done
first<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.979> you<00:01:11.070> need<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.250> unscrew<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.820> base

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
first is you need to unscrew the base

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.760 
first is you need to unscrew the base
plate<00:01:12.210> on<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> earth<00:01:12.630> slider<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.650> can

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
plate on the earth slider so you can

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.200 
plate on the earth slider so you can
attach<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.369> top<00:01:14.520> of<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:14.970> add<00:01:15.060> it

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
attach this on top of this and add it

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.730 
attach this on top of this and add it
right<00:01:15.240> on<00:01:15.450> top<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.869> slider<00:01:16.110> so<00:01:16.500> once<00:01:16.650> you

right on top of the slider so once you

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.499 
right on top of the slider so once you
can<00:01:16.830> screw<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.220> all<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> four<00:01:17.670> screws<00:01:18.000> for<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
can screw it all the four screws for the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.969 
can screw it all the four screws for the

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
facing the other direction so they're

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.230 
facing the other direction so they're
not<00:01:31.470> in<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.680> same<00:01:31.860> direction<00:01:31.890> as<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:33.030> break

is facing down so the black is on top
I'm<00:02:05.749> going<00:02:05.929> to<00:02:05.990> show<00:02:06.170> you<00:02:06.229> how<00:02:06.499> to<00:02:06.560> loop<00:02:07.219> the

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
I'm going to show you how to loop the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.460 
I'm going to show you how to loop the
belt<00:02:07.579> through<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.209> motor<00:02:08.420> it's<00:02:09.140> going<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.349> be

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
belt through the motor it's going to be

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.830 
belt through the motor it's going to be
as<00:02:09.619> a<00:02:09.649> u-shape<00:02:10.160> always<00:02:10.789> facing<00:02:11.269> the<00:02:11.360> belt<00:02:11.599> down

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
as a u-shape always facing the belt down

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.140 
as a u-shape always facing the belt down
as<00:02:12.080> I<00:02:12.200> said<00:02:12.410> bring<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.950> belt<00:02:13.160> in<00:02:13.310> on<00:02:13.760> the

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
as I said bring the belt in on the

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.809 
as I said bring the belt in on the
inside<00:02:14.510> of<00:02:14.540> the<00:02:14.750> bottom<00:02:15.080> gear<00:02:15.519> pull<00:02:16.519> it<00:02:16.700> out

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
inside of the bottom gear pull it out

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.240 
inside of the bottom gear pull it out
from<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.660> bottom<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.530> large<00:02:18.739> gear<00:02:19.040> and

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
from the bottom of the large gear and

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.000 
from the bottom of the large gear and
then<00:02:19.970> on<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.209> inside<00:02:20.360> again<00:02:20.810> of<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.739> smaller

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.010 
then on the inside again of the smaller

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.729 
then on the inside again of the smaller
gear<00:02:22.450> okay<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.510> the<00:02:23.720> next<00:02:23.900> step<00:02:24.080> is<00:02:24.230> adding<00:02:24.440> the

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
gear okay so the next step is adding the

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.910 
gear okay so the next step is adding the
actual<00:02:25.069> motor<00:02:25.340> to<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:26.060> cover<00:02:26.390> plate<00:02:26.660> so<00:02:27.620> it

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
actual motor to the cover plate so it

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.110 
actual motor to the cover plate so it
fits<00:02:28.190> right<00:02:28.519> in<00:02:28.730> there

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
fits right in there

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.580 
fits right in there
you<00:02:29.390> just<00:02:29.569> want<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:29.780> screw<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.200> all<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.500> way

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
you just want to screw this all the way

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:39.910 
you just want to screw this all the way
in<00:02:38.140> okay<00:02:39.140> and<00:02:39.260> then<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.440> next<00:02:39.650> step<00:02:39.739> is<00:02:39.890> just

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
in okay and then the next step is just

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.479 
in okay and then the next step is just
to<00:02:40.160> screw<00:02:40.400> the<00:02:40.549> bolt<00:02:40.730> on<00:02:40.879> the<00:02:41.390> opposite<00:02:41.840> side

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.979 

the<00:02:46.489> next<00:02:46.640> step<00:02:46.819> is<00:02:46.940> going<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.120> be<00:02:47.329> connecting

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
the next step is going to be connecting

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.690 
the next step is going to be connecting
the<00:02:48.140> limit<00:02:48.410> switch<00:02:48.590> cable<00:02:48.950> and<00:02:49.099> motor<00:02:49.280> cables

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
the limit switch cable and motor cables

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.580 
the limit switch cable and motor cables
to<00:02:49.849> the<00:02:49.970> actual<00:02:50.209> motor<00:02:50.480> okay<00:02:50.810> so<00:02:51.019> this<00:02:51.260> is<00:02:51.440> the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
to the actual motor okay so this is the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.740 
to the actual motor okay so this is the
basic<00:02:52.190> pan<00:02:52.549> tilt<00:02:52.849> control<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.450> comes<00:02:53.629> with

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
basic pan tilt control that comes with

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.569 
basic pan tilt control that comes with
the<00:02:53.840> system<00:02:54.230> it's<00:02:54.950> a<00:02:55.040> really<00:02:55.220> well-built

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
the system it's a really well-built

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.410 
the system it's a really well-built
controller<00:02:56.359> as<00:02:56.900> you<00:02:56.989> can<00:02:57.109> see<00:02:58.150> now<00:02:59.150> what<00:02:59.329> you

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
controller as you can see now what you

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.729 
controller as you can see now what you
want<00:02:59.599> to<00:02:59.660> do<00:02:59.750> is<00:02:59.840> you<00:02:59.930> want<00:03:00.049> to<00:03:00.109> add<00:03:00.230> those<00:03:00.470> two

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
want to do is you want to add those two

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.410 
want to do is you want to add those two
cables<00:03:01.129> that<00:03:01.340> I<00:03:01.370> just<00:03:01.609> added<00:03:01.790> a<00:03:02.000> limit<00:03:02.299> switch

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
cables that I just added a limit switch

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.449 
cables that I just added a limit switch
cable<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.019> the<00:03:03.079> motor<00:03:03.260> cable<00:03:03.650> to<00:03:04.099> the<00:03:04.190> bottom

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
cable and the motor cable to the bottom

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:05.890 
cable and the motor cable to the bottom
of<00:03:04.549> the<00:03:04.609> controller<00:03:04.940> here<00:03:05.180> the<00:03:05.480> next<00:03:05.750> step

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
of the controller here the next step

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.300 
of the controller here the next step
would<00:03:06.049> be<00:03:06.109> adding<00:03:06.530> the<00:03:06.620> power<00:03:06.799> there's<00:03:07.160> two

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
would be adding the power there's two

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.979 
would be adding the power there's two
decisions<00:03:07.790> for<00:03:07.970> power<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.420> have<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.690> actual

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
decisions for power you have the actual

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.170 
decisions for power you have the actual
plug-in<00:03:09.920> that<00:03:10.099> goes<00:03:10.310> right<00:03:10.609> into<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.000> wall

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
plug-in that goes right into the wall

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.180 
plug-in that goes right into the wall
and<00:03:11.389> you<00:03:11.690> also<00:03:11.870> have<00:03:12.139> the<00:03:12.290> battery<00:03:12.590> kit<00:03:12.889> I'm

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.190 
and you also have the battery kit I'm

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:14.559 
and you also have the battery kit I'm
going<00:03:13.340> to<00:03:13.430> show<00:03:13.519> you<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:13.730> two<00:03:13.880> options<00:03:14.090> here

00:03:14.559 --> 00:03:14.569 
going to show you the two options here

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.270 
going to show you the two options here
the<00:03:14.930> power<00:03:15.109> supply<00:03:15.470> plugs<00:03:15.769> in<00:03:15.919> right<00:03:15.950> here

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
the power supply plugs in right here

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.849 
the power supply plugs in right here
next<00:03:16.430> to<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.669> other<00:03:16.700> cables<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:18.500> did<00:03:18.709> come

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859 
next to the other cables it did come

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:20.559 
next to the other cables it did come
with<00:03:18.889> a<00:03:19.010> European<00:03:19.340> plug-in<00:03:19.910> but<00:03:20.090> it<00:03:20.180> also<00:03:20.329> has

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
with a European plug-in but it also has

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.569 
with a European plug-in but it also has
a<00:03:20.599> u.s.<00:03:20.959> adapter<00:03:21.410> died<00:03:21.950> right<00:03:22.190> in<00:03:22.220> front<00:03:22.340> here

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
a u.s. adapter died right in front here

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.940 
a u.s. adapter died right in front here
so<00:03:22.910> the<00:03:23.780> other<00:03:23.930> option<00:03:24.290> for<00:03:24.319> the<00:03:24.560> power<00:03:24.739> supply

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
so the other option for the power supply

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:26.740 
so the other option for the power supply
is<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.519> actual<00:03:25.819> battery<00:03:26.090> pack<00:03:26.329> with<00:03:26.540> that

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
is the actual battery pack with that

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.449 
is the actual battery pack with that
comes<00:03:26.989> with<00:03:27.139> the<00:03:27.260> system<00:03:27.440> it<00:03:27.919> does<00:03:28.190> come<00:03:28.430> with

00:03:28.449 --> 00:03:28.459 
comes with the system it does come with

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.610 
comes with the system it does come with
its<00:03:28.760> own<00:03:28.849> case<00:03:30.910> take<00:03:31.910> it<00:03:32.000> out<00:03:32.090> of<00:03:32.150> here<00:03:32.530> now<00:03:33.530> of

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
its own case take it out of here now of

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.750 
its own case take it out of here now of
course<00:03:33.769> this<00:03:33.919> is<00:03:34.069> for<00:03:34.250> when<00:03:34.400> you're<00:03:34.579> outdoors

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
course this is for when you're outdoors

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.460 
course this is for when you're outdoors
and<00:03:35.180> you<00:03:35.239> don't<00:03:35.419> have<00:03:35.540> access<00:03:35.870> to<00:03:36.019> power<00:03:36.200> and

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
and you don't have access to power and

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:37.930 
and you don't have access to power and
the<00:03:37.130> way<00:03:37.220> that<00:03:37.370> you<00:03:37.430> put<00:03:37.549> your<00:03:37.609> batteries

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
the way that you put your batteries

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.400 
the way that you put your batteries
inside<00:03:38.239> you<00:03:38.450> basically<00:03:38.810> squeeze<00:03:39.169> these

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
inside you basically squeeze these

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.190 
inside you basically squeeze these
buttons<00:03:39.799> together<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:41.030> opens<00:03:41.750> up<00:03:41.870> the<00:03:41.989> top

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
buttons together it opens up the top

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.640 
buttons together it opens up the top
here<00:03:43.720> then<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.840> pull<00:03:44.989> out<00:03:45.079> this<00:03:45.200> cartridge

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
here then you pull out this cartridge

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.470 
here then you pull out this cartridge
and<00:03:45.829> then<00:03:46.430> basically<00:03:46.849> your<00:03:47.030> batteries<00:03:47.359> go

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
and then basically your batteries go

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.990 
and then basically your batteries go
right<00:03:47.720> in<00:03:47.840> here<00:03:48.079> on<00:03:48.200> both<00:03:48.829> sides<00:03:48.859> and<00:03:49.760> then<00:03:49.970> you

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
right in here on both sides and then you

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.039 
right in here on both sides and then you
cleanly<00:03:50.359> put<00:03:50.510> it<00:03:50.599> back<00:03:50.690> in<00:03:50.840> here<00:03:52.720> of<00:03:53.720> course<00:03:53.900> a

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
cleanly put it back in here of course a

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.789 
cleanly put it back in here of course a
bag<00:03:54.200> has<00:03:54.380> a<00:03:54.410> hole<00:03:54.650> for<00:03:54.769> the<00:03:54.829> wire<00:03:55.480> right<00:03:56.480> here

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
bag has a hole for the wire right here

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.390 
bag has a hole for the wire right here
you<00:03:57.799> want<00:03:57.980> to<00:03:58.010> attach<00:03:58.220> the<00:03:58.400> wire<00:03:58.579> right<00:03:58.879> on<00:03:59.060> top

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
you want to attach the wire right on top

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.830 
you want to attach the wire right on top
grab<00:04:01.400> the<00:04:01.519> controller<00:04:01.849> just<00:04:02.389> add<00:04:02.510> the<00:04:02.660> plug

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
grab the controller just add the plug

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.900 
grab the controller just add the plug
right<00:04:02.989> here<00:04:03.230> at<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.349> bottom<00:04:03.790> and<00:04:04.790> you're

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
right here at the bottom and you're

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:05.409 
right here at the bottom and you're
ready<00:04:05.060> to<00:04:05.090> go

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:05.419 
ready to go

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:06.699 
ready to go
okay<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:05.900> I'm<00:04:06.019> just<00:04:06.139> going<00:04:06.260> to<00:04:06.349> turn<00:04:06.530> on<00:04:06.620> the

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:06.709 
okay so I'm just going to turn on the

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:08.780 
okay so I'm just going to turn on the
controller<00:04:07.040> now

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
controller now

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.880 
controller now
because<00:04:09.689> I<00:04:09.810> do<00:04:09.870> not<00:04:10.049> have<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.439> smart<00:04:10.709> pan

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
because I do not have the smart pan

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.679 
because I do not have the smart pan
until<00:04:11.220> it<00:04:11.310> head<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.489> cannot<00:04:11.939> go<00:04:12.180> up<00:04:12.390> and<00:04:12.569> down

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:12.689 
until it head I cannot go up and down

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:14.509 
until it head I cannot go up and down
but<00:04:13.260> I<00:04:13.290> can<00:04:13.470> definitely<00:04:13.620> go<00:04:13.920> left<00:04:14.159> and<00:04:14.340> right

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
but I can definitely go left and right

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:17.900 
but I can definitely go left and right
on<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.480> system<00:04:15.840> so<00:04:16.470> what<00:04:17.400> you<00:04:17.489> want<00:04:17.639> to<00:04:17.669> do<00:04:17.790> is

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
on the system so what you want to do is

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.939 
on the system so what you want to do is
this<00:04:18.030> slide<00:04:18.329> here<00:04:18.690> you<00:04:19.290> want<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.590> bring<00:04:19.829> the

00:04:19.939 --> 00:04:19.949 
this slide here you want to bring the

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:21.710 
this slide here you want to bring the
knob<00:04:20.100> up<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.430> goes<00:04:20.549> from<00:04:20.699> zero<00:04:21.090> all<00:04:21.359> the<00:04:21.419> way<00:04:21.660> to

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
knob up it goes from zero all the way to

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.780 
knob up it goes from zero all the way to
ninety<00:04:22.229> nine<00:04:22.410> obviously<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.400> higher<00:04:23.580> it<00:04:23.760> goes

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
ninety nine obviously the higher it goes

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.150 
ninety nine obviously the higher it goes
the<00:04:23.910> faster<00:04:24.360> the<00:04:24.479> system<00:04:24.810> goes<00:04:25.020> and<00:04:25.260> you<00:04:26.010> can

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
the faster the system goes and you can

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:32.870 
the faster the system goes and you can
turn<00:04:26.310> it<00:04:26.370> left<00:04:26.580> and<00:04:26.789> right<00:04:31.490> if<00:04:32.490> we're<00:04:32.610> moving

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
turn it left and right if we're moving

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.050 
turn it left and right if we're moving
back<00:04:33.030> and<00:04:33.530> then<00:04:34.530> slowly<00:04:34.949> lower<00:04:35.520> this<00:04:35.729> the

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
back and then slowly lower this the

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.080 
back and then slowly lower this the
speed<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.860> actual<00:04:38.190> system<00:04:38.520> is<00:04:38.639> going<00:04:38.760> to<00:04:38.820> slow

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
speed the actual system is going to slow

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.180 
speed the actual system is going to slow
down<00:04:39.300> as<00:04:39.630> well<00:04:39.840> it's<00:04:40.530> going<00:04:40.650> to<00:04:40.710> go<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:40.860> a<00:04:40.949> slow

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:41.190 
down as well it's going to go to a slow

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.210 
down as well it's going to go to a slow
stop<00:04:41.460> we<00:04:42.330> bring<00:04:42.510> it<00:04:42.600> back<00:04:42.720> up<00:04:42.889> I'll<00:04:43.889> start<00:04:44.039> back

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
stop we bring it back up I'll start back

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.610 
stop we bring it back up I'll start back
up<00:04:44.600> the<00:04:45.600> other<00:04:45.720> thing<00:04:45.930> that<00:04:45.960> we<00:04:46.139> can<00:04:46.260> control

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
up the other thing that we can control

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.920 
up the other thing that we can control
is<00:04:46.770> also<00:04:46.949> the<00:04:47.220> ramp<00:04:47.460> speed<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:48.120> can<00:04:48.270> go<00:04:48.449> press

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
is also the ramp speed you can go press

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.890 
is also the ramp speed you can go press
the<00:04:49.169> left<00:04:49.590> and<00:04:49.830> right<00:04:50.310> buttons<00:04:50.660> it's<00:04:51.660> going<00:04:51.840> to

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
the left and right buttons it's going to

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.860 
the left and right buttons it's going to
change<00:04:52.139> the<00:04:52.320> ramp<00:04:52.650> speed<00:04:52.979> by<00:04:53.250> one<00:04:53.720> so<00:04:54.720> that's

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
change the ramp speed by one so that's

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.960 
change the ramp speed by one so that's
changing<00:04:55.139> up<00:04:55.289> by<00:04:55.380> one<00:04:55.560> or<00:04:55.680> you<00:04:55.770> can<00:04:56.550> go<00:04:56.760> and

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
changing up by one or you can go and

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:58.460 
changing up by one or you can go and
hold<00:04:57.150> the<00:04:57.330> button<00:04:57.419> down<00:04:57.570> it's<00:04:57.960> going<00:04:58.080> to<00:04:58.139> jump

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
hold the button down it's going to jump

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.210 
hold the button down it's going to jump
it<00:04:58.560> up<00:04:58.650> by<00:04:59.400> ten<00:04:59.750> from<00:05:00.750> zero<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.199> ninety<00:05:01.830> nine<00:05:01.979> so

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
it up by ten from zero to ninety nine so

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.710 
it up by ten from zero to ninety nine so
the<00:05:02.340> ramp<00:05:02.460> speed<00:05:02.699> is<00:05:02.820> going<00:05:02.910> to<00:05:03.000> control<00:05:03.539> how

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
the ramp speed is going to control how

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.469 
the ramp speed is going to control how
fast<00:05:04.020> the<00:05:04.440> system<00:05:04.590> starts<00:05:05.160> and<00:05:05.400> stops<00:05:05.699> when

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
fast the system starts and stops when

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.000 
fast the system starts and stops when
you're<00:05:06.630> moving<00:05:06.960> the<00:05:07.050> joystick<00:05:07.229> so<00:05:07.740> let's<00:05:07.889> see

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
you're moving the joystick so let's see

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:09.469 
you're moving the joystick so let's see
if<00:05:08.130> we<00:05:08.220> go<00:05:08.400> bring<00:05:08.610> it<00:05:08.669> all<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:08.880> way<00:05:09.030> to<00:05:09.060> ninety

00:05:09.469 --> 00:05:09.479 
if we go bring it all the way to ninety

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:11.960 
if we go bring it all the way to ninety
nine<00:05:09.660> and<00:05:09.930> then<00:05:10.199> we<00:05:10.320> start<00:05:10.590> the<00:05:10.620> system<00:05:11.039> see

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
nine and then we start the system see

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.230 
nine and then we start the system see
how<00:05:12.090> fast<00:05:12.360> it<00:05:12.539> takes<00:05:12.570> to<00:05:12.990> start<00:05:13.639> see<00:05:14.639> how<00:05:14.760> I've

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
how fast it takes to start see how I've

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:16.730 
how fast it takes to start see how I've
turned<00:05:15.419> it<00:05:15.660> but<00:05:15.780> it<00:05:15.870> then<00:05:16.229> took<00:05:16.440> a<00:05:16.560> couple

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740 
turned it but it then took a couple

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.170 
turned it but it then took a couple
seconds<00:05:17.099> and<00:05:17.250> then<00:05:17.430> if<00:05:17.550> I<00:05:17.610> let<00:05:17.820> it<00:05:17.849> go<00:05:17.970> it's

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:18.180 
seconds and then if I let it go it's

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.520 
seconds and then if I let it go it's
going<00:05:18.300> to<00:05:18.389> take<00:05:18.510> a<00:05:18.539> bit<00:05:18.780> to<00:05:18.930> slow<00:05:19.110> down<00:05:20.539> if<00:05:21.539> I

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:22.530 
going to take a bit to slow down if I

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:24.770 
going to take a bit to slow down if I
move<00:05:22.740> this<00:05:22.949> at<00:05:23.099> a<00:05:23.130> lower<00:05:23.340> speed<00:05:23.760> closer<00:05:24.510> to

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:24.780 
move this at a lower speed closer to

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.740 
move this at a lower speed closer to
zero<00:05:25.020> means<00:05:25.289> a<00:05:25.470> faster<00:05:25.740> stop<00:05:26.570> even<00:05:27.570> though<00:05:27.630> we

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
zero means a faster stop even though we

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.360 
zero means a faster stop even though we
don't<00:05:27.930> have<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.229> smart<00:05:28.470> pin<00:05:28.650> and<00:05:28.830> tilt<00:05:28.949> had<00:05:29.190> to

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
don't have the smart pin and tilt had to

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.159 
don't have the smart pin and tilt had to
go<00:05:29.490> up<00:05:29.639> and<00:05:29.789> down<00:05:29.940> we<00:05:30.210> can<00:05:30.360> still<00:05:30.599> use<00:05:30.720> a<00:05:30.750> three

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
go up and down we can still use a three

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.740 
go up and down we can still use a three
access<00:05:31.560> mode<00:05:31.970> if<00:05:32.970> we<00:05:33.150> click<00:05:33.330> on<00:05:33.449> the<00:05:33.539> three

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750

start<00:05:35.580> up<00:05:35.699> and<00:05:35.910> then<00:05:36.750> what's<00:05:37.229> cool<00:05:37.440> about<00:05:37.470> it

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 
start up and then what's cool about it

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.770 
start up and then what's cool about it
is<00:05:37.979> you<00:05:38.580> won't<00:05:38.699> be<00:05:38.820> using<00:05:39.000> the<00:05:39.210> joystick<00:05:39.389> to<00:05:39.690> go

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:39.780 
is you won't be using the joystick to go

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.330 
is you won't be using the joystick to go
left<00:05:39.960> and<00:05:40.080> right<00:05:40.169> anymore<00:05:40.500> you<00:05:40.919> will<00:05:41.039> be<00:05:41.130> using

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
left and right anymore you will be using

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.010 
left and right anymore you will be using
the<00:05:41.580> left<00:05:41.789> and<00:05:41.970> right<00:05:42.210> button<00:05:42.539> and<00:05:42.660> it's<00:05:42.930> going

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
the left and right button and it's going

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.589 
the left and right button and it's going
to<00:05:43.080> automatically<00:05:43.710> move<00:05:44.039> the<00:05:44.490> slider<00:05:46.220> and

00:05:47.589 --> 00:05:47.599 
to automatically move the slider and

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:49.490 
to automatically move the slider and
it's<00:05:48.599> going<00:05:48.690> to<00:05:48.780> go<00:05:48.870> all<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.080> way<00:05:49.110> to<00:05:49.199> the<00:05:49.380> edge

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
it's going to go all the way to the edge

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.750 
it's going to go all the way to the edge
to<00:05:49.710> hit<00:05:49.830> the<00:05:49.949> limiter<00:05:50.280> and<00:05:50.400> then<00:05:50.520> it's<00:05:50.639> going

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:50.760 
to hit the limiter and then it's going

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.310 
to hit the limiter and then it's going
to<00:05:50.820> bounce<00:05:50.940> back<00:05:51.240> like<00:05:51.270> that<00:05:51.630> so<00:05:51.840> overall<00:05:52.110> the

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:52.320 
to bounce back like that so overall the

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:53.659 
to bounce back like that so overall the
konoba<00:05:52.680> motorized<00:05:53.010> system<00:05:53.310> is<00:05:53.400> a<00:05:53.430> great

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
konoba motorized system is a great

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.610 
konoba motorized system is a great
attachment<00:05:54.180> for<00:05:54.330> our<00:05:54.449> slider<00:05:54.720> we<00:05:55.050> have<00:05:55.229> tested

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:55.620 
attachment for our slider we have tested

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.990 
attachment for our slider we have tested
it<00:05:55.680> out<00:05:55.919> you<00:05:56.190> know<00:05:56.310> some<00:05:56.490> of<00:05:56.520> the<00:05:56.610> images<00:05:56.970> that

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
it out you know some of the images that

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.129 
it out you know some of the images that
we<00:05:57.120> received<00:05:57.510> are<00:05:57.750> great

00:05:58.129 --> 00:05:58.139 
we received are great

00:05:58.139 --> 00:05:59.360 
we received are great
previously<00:05:58.500> with<00:05:58.710> the<00:05:58.860> slider<00:05:59.099> it<00:05:59.280> was

00:05:59.360 --> 00:05:59.370 
previously with the slider it was

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:00.620 
previously with the slider it was
difficult<00:05:59.550> to<00:05:59.849> get<00:06:00.060> left<00:06:00.330> and<00:06:00.510> right

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
movements at a steady rate now with the

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.860 
movements at a steady rate now with the
system<00:06:02.490> it's<00:06:02.669> a<00:06:02.760> you<00:06:03.210> know<00:06:03.240> gives<00:06:03.570> it<00:06:03.690> at<00:06:03.780> a

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
system it's a you know gives it at a

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.330 
system it's a you know gives it at a
steady<00:06:04.020> speed<00:06:04.229> the<00:06:04.650> one<00:06:04.770> thing<00:06:04.919> I<00:06:05.010> did<00:06:05.190> notice

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
steady speed the one thing I did notice

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.219 
steady speed the one thing I did notice
while<00:06:05.669> we<00:06:05.760> were<00:06:05.849> outside<00:06:06.270> the<00:06:06.539> wires<00:06:06.810> do

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:07.229 
while we were outside the wires do

00:06:07.229 --> 00:06:09.170 
while we were outside the wires do
disconnect<00:06:07.770> sometimes<00:06:08.190> from<00:06:08.610> the<00:06:08.639> system
