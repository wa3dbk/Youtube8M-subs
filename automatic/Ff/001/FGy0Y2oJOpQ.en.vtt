done<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.450> little<00:02:32.630> more<00:02:32.750> designing<00:02:33.620> with<00:02:34.130> that

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340 
done a little more designing with that

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.310 
done a little more designing with that
part<00:02:34.580> of<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:34.790> but<00:02:35.000> then<00:02:35.209> this<00:02:35.660> is<00:02:35.720> really<00:02:36.110> nice

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
part of it but then this is really nice

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.310 
part of it but then this is really nice
the<00:02:36.500> design<00:02:36.800> so<00:02:37.010> sort<00:02:37.220> of<00:02:37.280> offsets<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:39.170> it

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
the design so sort of offsets that so it

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.800 
the design so sort of offsets that so it
still<00:02:39.530> gets<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.740> job<00:02:39.950> done<00:02:40.240> very<00:02:41.240> well<00:02:41.360> in

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
still gets the job done very well in

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.540 
still gets the job done very well in
this<00:02:42.230> car<00:02:42.440> is<00:02:42.590> packed<00:02:42.860> with<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.100> lot<00:02:43.310> of<00:02:43.340> great

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:43.550 
this car is packed with a lot of great

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.610 
this car is packed with a lot of great
technology<00:02:44.180> and<00:02:44.420> everything<00:02:44.780> like<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:44.930> and

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
technology and everything like that and

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.740 
technology and everything like that and
one<00:02:46.220> interesting<00:02:46.700> thing<00:02:46.730> we<00:02:47.030> will<00:02:47.150> find<00:02:47.450> is

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
one interesting thing we will find is

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.020 
one interesting thing we will find is
this<00:02:47.989> a<00:02:48.019> new<00:02:48.410> shifter<00:02:49.010> gear<00:02:49.340> selector<00:02:49.850> right

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
this a new shifter gear selector right

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.360 
this a new shifter gear selector right
here<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.989> it's<00:02:51.260> actually<00:02:51.620> the<00:02:51.709> exact<00:02:52.130> same

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
here and it's actually the exact same

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.900 
here and it's actually the exact same
shifter<00:02:52.820> then<00:02:53.239> is<00:02:53.360> in<00:02:53.480> the<00:02:53.570> audi<00:02:53.890> a8<00:02:54.890> and<00:02:55.370> the

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
shifter then is in the audi a8 and the

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.400 
shifter then is in the audi a8 and the
reason<00:02:56.060> for<00:02:56.239> that<00:02:56.330> being<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:57.080> the<00:02:57.200> same

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
reason for that being that the same

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.770 
reason for that being that the same
people<00:02:57.709> who<00:02:57.739> have<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.640> new<00:02:59.120> 8-speed

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
people who have the new 8-speed

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.440 
people who have the new 8-speed
automatic<00:02:59.930> transmission<00:03:00.290> for<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.160> a8<00:03:01.519> is

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
automatic transmission for the a8 is

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.020 
automatic transmission for the a8 is
right<00:03:02.959> here<00:03:03.350> in<00:03:03.530> this<00:03:03.890> vehicle<00:03:04.370> as<00:03:04.580> well<00:03:04.670> we

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
right here in this vehicle as well we

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:06.610 
right here in this vehicle as well we
have<00:03:05.120> the<00:03:05.239> same<00:03:05.450> 8-speed<00:03:05.959> automatic

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
have the same 8-speed automatic

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.670 
have the same 8-speed automatic
transmission<00:03:06.890> that<00:03:07.580> they<00:03:07.730> put<00:03:08.000> in<00:03:08.180> the<00:03:08.480> audi

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
transmission that they put in the audi

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.520 
transmission that they put in the audi
a8<00:03:09.880> so<00:03:10.880> really<00:03:11.510> impressive<00:03:11.930> same<00:03:12.140> company

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
a8 so really impressive same company

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.680 
a8 so really impressive same company
makes<00:03:12.769> that<00:03:12.980> transmission<00:03:13.519> so<00:03:14.269> now<00:03:14.420> let's<00:03:14.600> go

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:14.690 
makes that transmission so now let's go

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.690 
makes that transmission so now let's go
for<00:03:14.930> a<00:03:14.989> drive<00:03:15.230> and<00:03:15.440> see<00:03:15.650> on<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:15.920> new

for a drive and see on the new

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.870 
for a drive and see on the new
transmission<00:03:17.380> handles<00:03:18.380> all<00:03:18.500> that<00:03:18.530> power

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.450 

now<00:03:21.480> this<00:03:22.320> week<00:03:22.590> oh<00:03:22.710> we're<00:03:22.860> driving<00:03:23.190> right<00:03:23.220> in

horsepower<00:03:32.720> and<00:03:33.720> of<00:03:33.870> course<00:03:34.110> like<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.380> said<00:03:34.650> it

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
horsepower and of course like I said it

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.470 
horsepower and of course like I said it
is<00:03:34.830> a<00:03:34.950> has<00:03:35.550> an<00:03:35.700> 8-speed<00:03:36.210> automatic

is a has an 8-speed automatic

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.670 
is a has an 8-speed automatic
transmission<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:38.870> one<00:03:39.870> thing<00:03:40.170> that<00:03:40.560> I've

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
transmission and one thing that I've

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.290 
transmission and one thing that I've
noticed<00:03:40.710> while<00:03:41.160> driving<00:03:41.550> this<00:03:41.640> vehicle<00:03:41.850> is

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
noticed while driving this vehicle is

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.420 
noticed while driving this vehicle is
how<00:03:42.960> really<00:03:43.260> well<00:03:43.560> the<00:03:44.490> 8-speed<00:03:45.450> transmission

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
how really well the 8-speed transmission

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:49.010 
how really well the 8-speed transmission
handles<00:03:47.430> all<00:03:47.970> of<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.570> power<00:03:48.840> because

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
handles all of this power because

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.210 
handles all of this power because
there's<00:03:49.170> quite<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.380> bit<00:03:49.440> of<00:03:49.560> power<00:03:49.740> in<00:03:49.920> here<00:03:50.100> and

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
there's quite a bit of power in here and

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.880 
there's quite a bit of power in here and
we<00:03:50.490> have<00:03:50.520> a<00:03:50.640> lot<00:03:50.700> of<00:03:50.820> gears<00:03:51.210> of<00:03:51.420> course<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:52.620> so

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
we have a lot of gears of course and so

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.440 
we have a lot of gears of course and so
sometimes<00:03:53.130> you<00:03:53.550> know<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.910> could<00:03:54.300> be<00:03:54.420> a

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
sometimes you know that could be a

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.920 
sometimes you know that could be a
problem<00:03:55.100> but<00:03:56.100> it's<00:03:56.250> not<00:03:56.460> which<00:03:57.150> is<00:03:57.180> really<00:03:57.660> I'm

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
problem but it's not which is really I'm

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.330 
problem but it's not which is really I'm
really<00:03:57.960> happy<00:03:58.440> about<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.890> was<00:03:59.010> still<00:03:59.190> my

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
really happy about that was still my

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.280 
really happy about that was still my
concerned<00:03:59.790> that<00:04:00.480> was<00:04:00.630> going<00:04:00.780> to<00:04:00.840> be<00:04:00.930> difficult

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
concerned that was going to be difficult

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.140 
concerned that was going to be difficult
but<00:04:02.040> it's<00:04:02.190> not<00:04:03.320> yet<00:04:04.320> also<00:04:04.530> with<00:04:05.460> this<00:04:05.610> vehicle

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
but it's not yet also with this vehicle

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.770 
but it's not yet also with this vehicle
you<00:04:06.510> know<00:04:06.600> we<00:04:06.810> have<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.260> power<00:04:07.530> and<00:04:08.360> with<00:04:09.360> the

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
you know we have the power and with the

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.950 
you know we have the power and with the
new<00:04:10.310> extremely<00:04:11.310> efficient<00:04:11.960> 8-speed

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
new extremely efficient 8-speed

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.350 
new extremely efficient 8-speed
automatic<00:04:13.110> it<00:04:13.920> also<00:04:14.100> allows<00:04:14.310> us<00:04:14.580> to<00:04:14.790> get<00:04:15.330> a

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
automatic it also allows us to get a

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.500 
automatic it also allows us to get a
much<00:04:15.870> much<00:04:16.620> better<00:04:17.220> fuel<00:04:18.090> time<00:04:18.299> we<00:04:18.420> actually

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
much much better fuel time we actually

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:22.430 
much much better fuel time we actually
get<00:04:18.780> 31<00:04:19.700> miles<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.090> gallon<00:04:21.270> on<00:04:21.570> the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
get 31 miles to the gallon on the

get 31 miles to the gallon on the
highway<00:04:22.650> around<00:04:23.640> 23<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:24.630> 27<00:04:25.260> in<00:04:25.980> the<00:04:26.160> city<00:04:26.460> so

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
highway around 23 to 27 in the city so

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.270 
highway around 23 to 27 in the city so
I'm<00:04:27.540> really<00:04:27.990> impressed<00:04:28.260> this<00:04:28.950> is<00:04:29.100> such<00:04:29.250> a

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
I'm really impressed this is such a

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.270 
I'm really impressed this is such a
large<00:04:29.610> vehicle<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:31.020> good<00:04:31.200> fuel<00:04:31.500> economy<00:04:31.590> that

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
large vehicle the good fuel economy that

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.750 
large vehicle the good fuel economy that
we<00:04:32.400> are<00:04:32.490> able<00:04:32.640> to<00:04:33.000> get<00:04:33.660> out<00:04:33.840> of<00:04:33.870> it<00:04:34.160> and<00:04:35.160> then

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
we are able to get out of it and then

would<00:06:49.110> be<00:06:49.230> quite<00:06:49.470> difficult<00:06:49.710> so<00:06:50.220> I'm<00:06:50.310> glad

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:50.460 
would be quite difficult so I'm glad

would be quite difficult so I'm glad
