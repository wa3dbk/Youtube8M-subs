00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
story a year ago with Golden State was

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:31.210 
story a year ago with Golden State was
promising<00:03:29.989> season<00:03:30.230> ticket<00:03:30.709> holders<00:03:31.040> that

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
promising season ticket holders that

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.270

bit<00:03:35.840> because<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.410> Warriors<00:03:36.739> team<00:03:36.950> just

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
bit because the Warriors team just

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:39.100 
bit because the Warriors team just
wasn't<00:03:37.700> quite<00:03:37.879> talented<00:03:38.180> enough<00:03:38.660> to<00:03:38.720> fulfill

wasn't quite talented enough to fulfill
that<00:03:39.620> promise<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.790> anytime<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.750> put

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
that promise and anytime you put

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.360 
that promise and anytime you put
