00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
at that somehow Chrysler needs to come

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.659 
at that somehow Chrysler needs to come
up<00:00:30.810> with<00:00:30.929> some<00:00:31.170> better<00:00:31.320> glue<00:00:31.890> for<00:00:32.550> their

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
up with some better glue for their

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.010 
up with some better glue for their
housings<00:00:33.180> they<00:00:33.390> seem<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.690> have<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.960> problem

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
housings they seem to have this problem

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.310 
housings they seem to have this problem
a<00:00:34.710> lot<00:00:36.559> so<00:00:38.180> the<00:00:39.180> lower<00:00:39.480> hose<00:00:39.750> off<00:00:40.020> there<00:00:40.200> was<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
a lot so the lower hose off there was a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.660 
a lot so the lower hose off there was a
clamp<00:00:40.649> here<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:43.320> wallah<00:00:43.710> looks<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.550> 8

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
clamp here and wallah looks like 8

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.049 
clamp here and wallah looks like 8
millimeter<00:00:45.090> bolts<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:46.579> we'll<00:00:47.579> see<00:00:47.820> how

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
millimeter bolts and we'll see how

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.299 
millimeter bolts and we'll see how
easier<00:00:48.510> hard<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:48.840> is<00:00:48.899> I<00:00:49.469> have<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.860> move<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
easier hard this is I have to move the

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.220 
easier hard this is I have to move the
intake<00:00:50.700> actually<00:00:51.300> which<00:00:51.780> would<00:00:51.930> be<00:00:52.050> ten

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
intake actually which would be ten

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:14.960 
intake actually which would be ten
millimeter<00:00:52.649> bolts

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:21.540 

okay<00:01:16.380> back<00:01:17.380> here<00:01:18.270> is<00:01:19.270> the<00:01:19.540> hose

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
okay back here is the hose

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.850 
okay back here is the hose
that<00:01:22.120> attaches<00:01:22.510> to<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.380> pipe<00:01:23.560> that<00:01:23.830> goes

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
that attaches to the pipe that goes

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.070 
that attaches to the pipe that goes
underneath<00:01:24.370> the<00:01:24.580> engine<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:25.600> there's<00:01:26.020> a

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
underneath the engine and there's a

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.660 
underneath the engine and there's a
bracket<00:01:26.410> back<00:01:26.830> there<00:01:27.070> if<00:01:27.160> you<00:01:27.220> put<00:01:27.340> your<00:01:27.460> hand

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
bracket back there if you put your hand

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.750 
bracket back there if you put your hand
back<00:01:27.820> here<00:01:28.060> you<00:01:28.180> can<00:01:28.300> feel<00:01:28.480> the<00:01:28.600> bracket<00:01:29.760> so

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:30.760 
back here you can feel the bracket so

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.400 
back here you can feel the bracket so
here's<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.210> 10<00:01:31.390> millimeter<00:01:31.690> bolt<00:01:32.020> for<00:01:32.320> that

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
here's the 10 millimeter bolt for that

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.160 
here's the 10 millimeter bolt for that
bracket<00:01:32.680> I<00:01:32.890> took<00:01:33.070> this<00:01:33.220> out<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.810> for<00:01:35.020> whatever

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
bracket I took this out and for whatever

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.030 
bracket I took this out and for whatever
reason<00:01:35.620> to<00:01:35.710> give<00:01:35.860> me<00:01:35.950> enough<00:01:36.130> slack<00:01:36.550> I<00:01:38.040> pulled

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
reason to give me enough slack I pulled

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:43.170 
reason to give me enough slack I pulled
on<00:01:39.190> this<00:01:39.460> pulled<00:01:40.180> forward<00:01:40.510> enough<00:01:40.960> and<00:01:42.180> the

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:43.180 
on this pulled forward enough and the

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.320 
on this pulled forward enough and the
unit<00:01:43.420> came<00:01:43.630> out<00:01:44.730> so<00:01:45.730> I'm<00:01:45.790> pretty<00:01:46.000> happy<00:01:46.150> with

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
unit came out so I'm pretty happy with

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:47.790 
unit came out so I'm pretty happy with
that

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:47.800 
that

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.080 
that
I<00:01:47.920> didn't<00:01:48.490> think<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.670> was<00:01:48.730> going<00:01:48.880> to<00:01:48.970> really

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
I didn't think it was going to really

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.790 
I didn't think it was going to really
work<00:01:49.390> so<00:01:49.420> didn't<00:01:49.780> shoot<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.110> video<00:01:50.350> of<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.620> but

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
work so didn't shoot the video of it but

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.609 
work so didn't shoot the video of it but
I'll<00:01:51.280> show<00:01:51.460> you<00:01:51.520> putting<00:01:52.060> it<00:01:52.120> back<00:01:52.210> in<00:01:52.420> I<00:01:52.540> guess

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:56.619 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:58.870 

I'm<00:01:57.619> just<00:01:57.770> going<00:01:57.890> to<00:01:57.979> try<00:01:58.189> and<00:01:58.219> wipe<00:01:58.460> down<00:01:58.490> this

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
I'm just going to try and wipe down this

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.819 
I'm just going to try and wipe down this
mounting<00:01:59.420> surface<00:01:59.929> maybe<00:02:00.229> use<00:02:00.469> a<00:02:00.500> little

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829 
mounting surface maybe use a little

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.069 
mounting surface maybe use a little
sandpaper<00:02:01.310> or<00:02:01.759> Birla<00:02:02.060> pad<00:02:02.270> if<00:02:02.420> we<00:02:02.539> need<00:02:02.689> to<00:02:02.869> and

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079

so<00:04:05.370> you<00:04:05.460> see<00:04:05.910> on<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.120> video<00:04:06.240> actually<00:04:06.780> that

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
so you see on the video actually that

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.990 
so you see on the video actually that
bracket<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.560> not<00:04:07.800> like<00:04:08.010> welded<00:04:08.460> onto<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.790> pipe

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
bracket is not like welded onto the pipe

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.790 
bracket is not like welded onto the pipe
or<00:04:09.150> anything<00:04:09.330> it's<00:04:09.540> just<00:04:09.570> uh<00:04:09.840> kind<00:04:10.650> of<00:04:10.680> a

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
or anything it's just uh kind of a

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.440 
or anything it's just uh kind of a
friction<00:04:11.130> fit<00:04:11.960> snaps<00:04:12.960> onto<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.500> pipe<00:04:14.450> you'll

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
friction fit snaps onto the pipe you'll

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:17.300 
friction fit snaps onto the pipe you'll
slide<00:04:15.780> that<00:04:15.990> pipe<00:04:16.260> back<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:16.709> forth<00:04:16.950> on<00:04:17.190> the

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
slide that pipe back and forth on the

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:19.890 
slide that pipe back and forth on the
bracket

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.659 

like<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.560> said<00:04:20.620> you<00:04:20.859> can<00:04:20.979> see<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.190> bull<00:04:21.340> toll

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
like I said you can see the bull toll

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:29.040 
like I said you can see the bull toll
for<00:04:22.120> the<00:04:22.180> on<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.419> bracket<00:04:23.970> back<00:04:24.970> there<00:04:25.530> so<00:04:28.050> let

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
for the on the bracket back there so let

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.120 
for the on the bracket back there so let
you<00:04:29.139> know<00:04:29.229> what<00:04:29.350> you're<00:04:29.440> dealing<00:04:29.560> with<00:04:29.740> back

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
you know what you're dealing with back

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.790 
you know what you're dealing with back
there<00:04:30.550> and<00:04:30.940> so<00:04:31.300> we<00:04:31.449> can<00:04:31.630> bolt<00:04:32.139> this<00:04:32.320> into<00:04:32.590> place

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
there and so we can bolt this into place

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.760 
there and so we can bolt this into place
and<00:04:33.040> then<00:04:33.100> we'll<00:04:33.540> get<00:04:34.540> that<00:04:34.600> ten<00:04:35.380> millimeter

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
and then we'll get that ten millimeter

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:44.260 
and then we'll get that ten millimeter
bolt<00:04:35.949> back<00:04:36.160> on<00:04:36.490> the<00:04:38.340> back<00:04:39.340> on<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:39.610> bracket

screws<00:04:49.620> put<00:04:50.069> our<00:04:50.129> hose<00:04:50.250> back<00:04:50.580> on<00:04:51.110> for<00:04:52.110> the

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
screws put our hose back on for the

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.159 
screws put our hose back on for the
bleeder<00:04:52.620> I'll<00:04:53.009> leave<00:04:53.189> this<00:04:53.340> open<00:04:54.080> when<00:04:55.080> they

bleeder I'll leave this open when they

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:56.929 
bleeder I'll leave this open when they
fill<00:04:55.379> it<00:04:55.469> with<00:04:55.560> coolant<00:04:55.889> until<00:04:56.219> coolant<00:04:56.639> comes

00:04:56.929 --> 00:04:56.939 
fill it with coolant until coolant comes

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.249 
fill it with coolant until coolant comes
out<00:04:58.340> and<00:04:59.340> then<00:04:59.520> you<00:04:59.550> can<00:04:59.699> put<00:05:00.210> that<00:05:00.240> screw<00:05:01.080> in

out and then you can put that screw in
or<00:05:01.439> tighten<00:05:01.770> it<00:05:01.830> up<00:05:03.919> after<00:05:04.919> coolant<00:05:05.580> flows<00:05:05.789> out

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:06.469 
or tighten it up after coolant flows out

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:18.420 
or tighten it up after coolant flows out

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:31.850 
we'll get them started with my little

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.320 
we'll get them started with my little

try that before on a wrench on them you
don't<00:05:39.980> want<00:05:40.100> to<00:05:40.160> cross<00:05:40.340> thread<00:05:40.640> them<00:05:41.020> that

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:42.020 
don't want to cross thread them that

intake and actually see the hose and the
pipe<00:05:54.400> and<00:05:54.669> the<00:05:54.759> bracket<00:05:55.150> pretty<00:05:55.419> well<00:05:55.689> I<00:05:56.310> don't

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:57.310 
pipe and the bracket pretty well I don't

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.159 
pipe and the bracket pretty well I don't
have<00:05:57.400> it<00:05:57.460> well<00:05:57.699> lit<00:05:57.969> right<00:05:58.120> now<00:05:58.330> but<00:05:58.569> trust<00:05:58.990> me

00:05:59.159 --> 00:05:59.169 
have it well lit right now but trust me

right<00:05:59.349> down<00:05:59.560> there<00:05:59.830> you<00:05:59.949> can<00:06:00.069> see<00:06:00.099> the<00:06:00.310> bracket

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:00.729 
right down there you can see the bracket

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:02.700 
right down there you can see the bracket
you<00:06:00.909> can<00:06:00.939> just<00:06:01.120> use<00:06:01.210> a<00:06:01.240> screwdriver<00:06:01.479> pry<00:06:02.439> bar

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:02.710 
you can just use a screwdriver pry bar

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.339 
you can just use a screwdriver pry bar
some<00:06:02.919> and<00:06:03.099> slide<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.550> bracket<00:06:04.259> where<00:06:05.259> you

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:05.349 
some and slide the bracket where you

00:06:05.349 --> 00:06:06.809 
some and slide the bracket where you
need<00:06:05.499> it<00:06:05.529> to<00:06:05.620> be<00:06:05.740> because<00:06:06.039> it<00:06:06.249> didn't<00:06:06.460> go<00:06:06.550> back

00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:06.819 
need it to be because it didn't go back

00:06:06.819 --> 00:06:09.120 
need it to be because it didn't go back
a<00:06:06.849> little<00:06:07.120> bit

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.130 
a little bit

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:11.660 
a little bit
when<00:06:09.520> I<00:06:09.580> was<00:06:09.700> pulling<00:06:09.910> the<00:06:09.940> pipe<00:06:10.150> forward<00:06:10.540> so

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
when I was pulling the pipe forward so

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.650 
when I was pulling the pipe forward so
hope<00:06:12.670> that's<00:06:12.850> another<00:06:13.060> angle<00:06:13.360> that'll<00:06:13.570> help

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:13.660 
hope that's another angle that'll help

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.870 
hope that's another angle that'll help
you
