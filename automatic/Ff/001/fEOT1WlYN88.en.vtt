00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.540
 upper block 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.540
 knife and so above the opponent's hands 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.420
 lower your hand grab her and hold 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.420
 cutting movement on the neck 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:50.270
 This is another variant of the upper knife 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.270
 already deployed with a sharp end up and 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:59.090
 best to implement blocking 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:04.160
 motion 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.160
 with a chop on the forearm 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.310
 in response to the length of the performance 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.230
 after the defense a counterattack 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.860
 In this case, fencing with a knife against 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.930
 same is carried out fighting left-sided 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.140
 racks are attached forward with the left hand 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:52.200
 which mainly fulfill the role 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:56.560
 the shield she first meets the attackers 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.759
 limb blocks its movement and after 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.710
 there is a counter attack but this option 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.369
 good classic in combat 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.369
 protection in
