00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
to sweeten it up a little bit this is

the<00:01:39.119> green<00:01:39.329> power<00:01:39.600> juicer<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.530> is<00:01:40.710> my

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the green power juicer and this is my

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.010 
the green power juicer and this is my
personal<00:01:41.000> favorite<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.240> first<00:01:42.509> reason<00:01:42.899> is

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
personal favorite the first reason is

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.410 
personal favorite the first reason is
because<00:01:43.079> when<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.680> put<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.950> plant<00:01:44.250> through<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
because when I put the plant through the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.480 
because when I put the plant through the
juicer<00:01:45.630> ill<00:01:46.049> go<00:01:46.320> through<00:01:46.829> what's<00:01:47.009> called<00:01:47.189> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
juicer ill go through what's called the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.760 
juicer ill go through what's called the
twin<00:01:47.790> gear<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:49.229> juice<00:01:49.439> is<00:01:49.590> actually

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
twin gear and the juice is actually

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.940 
twin gear and the juice is actually
crushed<00:01:50.460> out<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.270> the<00:01:51.360> plant<00:01:51.659> there's<00:01:52.140> no<00:01:52.439> heat

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
crushed out of the plant there's no heat

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.550 
crushed out of the plant there's no heat
so<00:01:53.430> all<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.759> nutrients<00:01:54.360> will<00:01:54.540> remain<00:01:54.840> intact

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
so all the nutrients will remain intact

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.580 
so all the nutrients will remain intact
number<00:01:56.009> two<00:01:56.250> there's<00:01:57.119> no<00:01:57.299> oxidation<00:01:57.780> with

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
number two there's no oxidation with

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.950 
number two there's no oxidation with
this<00:01:58.770> type<00:01:59.009> of<00:01:59.189> juicer<00:01:59.579> whereas<00:02:00.450> with<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
this type of juicer whereas with the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.469 
this type of juicer whereas with the
centrifugal<00:02:01.469> juicer<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.310> spins<00:02:02.759> around<00:02:02.939> and

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
centrifugal juicer it spins around and

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.250 
centrifugal juicer it spins around and
air<00:02:04.049> gets<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.469> there

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:05.260 
air gets in there

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.830 
air gets in there
new<00:02:05.380> trees<00:02:05.590> begin<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:06.040> oxidize<00:02:06.580> okay<00:02:07.450> so<00:02:07.660> let's

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
new trees begin to oxidize okay so let's

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.020 
new trees begin to oxidize okay so let's
just<00:02:08.050> dive<00:02:08.470> right<00:02:08.770> in<00:02:09.040> and<00:02:09.280> I'm<00:02:09.729> going<00:02:09.970> to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
just dive right in and I'm going to

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.470 
just dive right in and I'm going to
start<00:02:10.330> juicing<00:02:11.050> with<00:02:11.260> the<00:02:11.380> Collard<00:02:11.650> leaves<00:02:12.480> so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
start juicing with the Collard leaves so

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.030 
start juicing with the Collard leaves so
we'll<00:02:13.630> put<00:02:13.810> that<00:02:14.020> in<00:02:14.340> my<00:02:15.340> first

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
we'll put that in my first

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.840 
we'll put that in my first
okay<00:02:18.540> well<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.630> juice<00:02:20.190> comes<00:02:21.190> right<00:02:21.400> out<00:02:21.430> here
