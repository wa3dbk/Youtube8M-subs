00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
the way that the utilities in this unit

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.730 
the way that the utilities in this unit
work<00:00:28.280> so<00:00:28.910> this<00:00:29.420> is<00:00:29.600> a<00:00:29.630> newer<00:00:29.960> building<00:00:30.320> and

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
work so this is a newer building and

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.640 
work so this is a newer building and
what<00:00:31.039> it<00:00:31.160> has<00:00:31.369> is<00:00:31.880> a<00:00:32.090> common<00:00:32.870> source<00:00:33.140> heat<00:00:33.380> pump

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:33.650 
what it has is a common source heat pump

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.250 
what it has is a common source heat pump
system<00:00:34.070> in<00:00:34.190> each<00:00:34.489> unit<00:00:34.940> what<00:00:35.480> that<00:00:35.660> means<00:00:35.930> is

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:36.260 
system in each unit what that means is

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.210 
system in each unit what that means is
the<00:00:36.530> building<00:00:37.100> does<00:00:37.579> not<00:00:37.760> have<00:00:38.170> individual

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
the building does not have individual

the building does not have individual
exterior<00:00:40.220> air<00:00:40.460> compressors<00:00:41.060> and<00:00:41.739> HVAC

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
exterior air compressors and HVAC

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:45.670 
exterior air compressors and HVAC
compressors<00:00:43.610> outside<00:00:44.120> you<00:00:44.690> have<00:00:44.720> one<00:00:45.260> big

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
compressors outside you have one big

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.620 
compressors outside you have one big
system<00:00:46.070> that<00:00:46.430> the<00:00:46.520> building<00:00:46.880> operates<00:00:47.390> and

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
system that the building operates and

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.470 
system that the building operates and
then<00:00:48.110> that<00:00:48.590> runs<00:00:48.950> plumbing<00:00:49.579> through<00:00:49.790> all<00:00:50.120> of

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:50.480 
then that runs plumbing through all of

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.959 
then that runs plumbing through all of
these<00:00:50.809> units<00:00:51.260> that<00:00:51.410> are<00:00:51.590> in<00:00:51.770> each<00:00:52.160> apartment

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
these units that are in each apartment

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.430 
these units that are in each apartment
or<00:00:53.360> condo<00:00:53.930> in<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.290> building<00:00:54.620> so<00:00:54.860> this<00:00:55.579> is<00:00:55.880> a

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
or condo in the building so this is a

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.470 
or condo in the building so this is a
packaged<00:00:57.440> unit<00:00:57.800> or<00:00:57.980> a<00:00:58.550> common<00:00:59.090> source<00:00:59.300> heat

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
packaged unit or a common source heat

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.630 
packaged unit or a common source heat
pump<00:00:59.719> and<00:00:59.899> what<00:01:00.440> it<00:01:00.590> does<00:01:00.770> is<00:01:00.920> you'll<00:01:01.100> see<00:01:01.340> here

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:01.640 
pump and what it does is you'll see here

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.979 
pump and what it does is you'll see here
there's<00:01:01.730> a<00:01:01.850> couple<00:01:01.969> of<00:01:02.210> hose<00:01:02.329> lines<00:01:02.629> coming

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
there's a couple of hose lines coming

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.980 
there's a couple of hose lines coming
into<00:01:03.140> it<00:01:03.350> they<00:01:03.950> act<00:01:04.280> as<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:05.089> same<00:01:05.359> thing<00:01:05.780> that

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
into it they act as the same thing that

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.099 
into it they act as the same thing that
you<00:01:06.170> have<00:01:06.439> in<00:01:06.770> another<00:01:07.729> like<00:01:08.479> single-family

00:01:09.099 --> 00:01:09.109 
you have in another like single-family

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:12.069 
you have in another like single-family
home<00:01:09.469> system<00:01:09.979> where<00:01:10.609> the<00:01:11.060> coolant<00:01:11.869> goes

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
home system where the coolant goes

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.830 
home system where the coolant goes
inside<00:01:12.709> and<00:01:13.039> outside<00:01:13.249> of<00:01:13.549> the<00:01:13.819> home<00:01:13.999> out<00:01:14.569> to

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
inside and outside of the home out to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.169 
inside and outside of the home out to
the<00:01:14.929> compressor<00:01:15.439> and<00:01:15.619> back<00:01:15.829> in<00:01:16.130> this<00:01:16.789> does<00:01:17.029> the

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
the compressor and back in this does the

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:18.789 
the compressor and back in this does the
same<00:01:17.420> thing<00:01:17.719> except<00:01:18.139> it's<00:01:18.289> doing<00:01:18.590> it<00:01:18.679> on<00:01:18.770> a

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
same thing except it's doing it on a

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:21.129 
same thing except it's doing it on a
much<00:01:19.100> bigger<00:01:19.310> scale<00:01:19.609> so<00:01:20.389> basically<00:01:20.959> the

00:01:21.129 --> 00:01:21.139 
much bigger scale so basically the

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:23.559 
much bigger scale so basically the
building<00:01:21.380> has<00:01:21.859> a<00:01:22.189> chiller<00:01:22.609> up<00:01:22.939> on<00:01:23.240> the<00:01:23.359> roof

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
building has a chiller up on the roof

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:27.340 
building has a chiller up on the roof
and<00:01:23.810> a<00:01:24.729> boiler<00:01:25.729> system<00:01:26.179> so<00:01:26.389> what<00:01:26.569> it<00:01:26.719> does<00:01:26.899> is

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
and a boiler system so what it does is

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.679 
and a boiler system so what it does is
the<00:01:27.829> building<00:01:28.310> is<00:01:28.459> constantly<00:01:28.999> circulating

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:29.689 
the building is constantly circulating

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:31.359 
the building is constantly circulating
either<00:01:29.990> water<00:01:30.319> or<00:01:30.499> coolant<00:01:30.950> or<00:01:31.069> whatever

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
either water or coolant or whatever

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.669 
either water or coolant or whatever
they're<00:01:31.579> circulating<00:01:32.270> on<00:01:32.439> usually<00:01:33.439> some<00:01:33.649> kind

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
they're circulating on usually some kind

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.760 
they're circulating on usually some kind
of<00:01:34.069> water<00:01:34.399> mix<00:01:34.869> through<00:01:35.869> these<00:01:36.049> lines<00:01:36.409> and

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
of water mix through these lines and

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.519 
of water mix through these lines and
it's<00:01:37.429> like<00:01:37.759> as<00:01:38.060> far<00:01:38.509> as<00:01:38.630> your<00:01:38.749> units<00:01:39.109> concerned

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:39.529 
it's like as far as your units concerned

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:41.800 
it's like as far as your units concerned
it's<00:01:40.069> as<00:01:40.249> if<00:01:40.399> the<00:01:40.549> weather<00:01:40.729> outside<00:01:41.029> is<00:01:41.329> always

well<00:01:56.630> you<00:01:57.079> can<00:01:57.259> absolutely<00:01:57.649> do<00:01:57.889> that<00:01:58.039> with<00:01:58.189> one

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
well you can absolutely do that with one

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.889 
well you can absolutely do that with one
of<00:01:58.340> these<00:01:58.520> systems<00:01:58.729> it's<00:01:59.239> not<00:01:59.450> always<00:01:59.749> the

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
of these systems it's not always the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:01.449 
of these systems it's not always the
most<00:01:59.929> efficient<00:02:00.619> but<00:02:00.770> it's<00:02:01.279> definitely

00:02:01.449 --> 00:02:01.459 
most efficient but it's definitely

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:03.519 
most efficient but it's definitely
something<00:02:01.939> that<00:02:02.179> you<00:02:02.270> can<00:02:02.539> do<00:02:02.810> it's<00:02:03.079> not<00:02:03.259> like

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:03.529 
something that you can do it's not like

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:05.080 
something that you can do it's not like
in<00:02:03.739> one<00:02:03.889> of<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.130> large-scale<00:02:04.549> apartment

lower capacity you can see that's kind

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.330 
lower capacity you can see that's kind
