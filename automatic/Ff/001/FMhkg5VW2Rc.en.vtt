00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
shield what if you look at this from a

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.930 
shield what if you look at this from a
tooltip<00:00:15.859> it's<00:00:16.859> got<00:00:17.100> frost<00:00:17.400> arrow<00:00:17.609> in<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
tooltip it's got frost arrow in the

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.330 
tooltip it's got frost arrow in the

all<00:00:20.640> what<00:00:21.000> this<00:00:21.210> skill<00:00:21.570> actually<00:00:22.020> does

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:22.580 
all what this skill actually does

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.370 
all what this skill actually does
lifeshield<00:00:23.580> fortunately<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.930> little<00:00:25.260> bit

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
lifeshield fortunately is a little bit

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.320 
lifeshield fortunately is a little bit
clearer<00:00:25.710> but<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.189> still<00:00:26.460> worded<00:00:26.910> terribly

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
clearer but it's still worded terribly

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.029 
clearer but it's still worded terribly
and<00:00:27.599> nobody<00:00:28.349> really<00:00:28.470> has<00:00:28.680> a<00:00:28.710> clue<00:00:28.920> what

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
and nobody really has a clue what

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.700 
and nobody really has a clue what
they're<00:00:29.160> specking<00:00:29.550> into<00:00:29.789> until<00:00:30.029> they<00:00:30.179> do<00:00:30.240> it

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
they're specking into until they do it

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.069 
they're specking into until they do it
so<00:00:31.710> the<00:00:32.189> long<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.430> short<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.079> lifeshield

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
so the long and short of it lifeshield

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.950 
so the long and short of it lifeshield
offers<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.590> heel<00:00:34.980> at<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.760> end<00:00:35.880> so<00:00:36.450> once<00:00:36.750> your

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
offers a heel at the end so once your

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.490 
offers a heel at the end so once your
shield<00:00:37.200> gets<00:00:37.559> taken<00:00:37.980> down<00:00:38.210> you<00:00:39.210> have<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.719> pretty

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
shield gets taken down you have a pretty

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.319 
shield gets taken down you have a pretty
substantial<00:00:41.309> heal<00:00:41.610> in<00:00:41.879> my<00:00:42.570> case<00:00:42.840> m<00:00:44.059> if<00:00:45.059> i

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
substantial heal in my case m if i

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
you know what you're doing you're more

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:09.590 
you know what you're doing you're more

tanisha shield the reason being the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.020 
tanisha shield the reason being the
absorb<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.200> much<00:01:13.470> higher<00:01:13.740> my<00:01:14.670> absorb

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
absorb is so much higher my absorb

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.859 
absorb is so much higher my absorb
currently<00:01:15.390> is<00:01:15.860> 4500<00:01:17.119> which<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.270> a<00:01:18.299> huge<00:01:18.630> amount

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
currently is 4500 which is a huge amount

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.289 
currently is 4500 which is a huge amount
especially<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.790> think<00:01:20.820> about<00:01:21.090> it

especially and if you think about it

worth noting with regards to your shield

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.390 
worth noting with regards to your shield
is<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:23.959> you<00:02:24.049> should<00:02:24.080> be<00:02:24.500> where<00:02:24.860> possible

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
is that you should be where possible

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.640 
is that you should be where possible
using<00:02:25.879> elemental<00:02:26.209> activation<00:02:27.049> before<00:02:27.500> you

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
using elemental activation before you

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.199 
using elemental activation before you
shield<00:02:27.980> I<00:02:28.870> tend<00:02:29.870> to<00:02:29.930> shield<00:02:30.260> before<00:02:30.530> a<00:02:30.739> pull

weight<00:02:32.209> and<00:02:32.450> then<00:02:32.810> about<00:02:32.959> 25<00:02:33.530> seconds<00:02:34.040> of<00:02:34.340> the

weight and then about 25 seconds of the

elemental<00:02:36.560> activation<00:02:37.299> resealed<00:02:38.299> pole<00:02:39.170> and

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
elemental activation resealed pole and

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.430 
elemental activation resealed pole and
burst<00:02:39.760> now<00:02:40.760> the<00:02:41.090> reason<00:02:41.269> for<00:02:41.599> this<00:02:41.720> being<00:02:42.019> the

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
burst now the reason for this being the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.199 
burst now the reason for this being the
thirty<00:02:42.709> percent<00:02:43.010> damage<00:02:43.280> increase<00:02:43.819> you<00:02:43.970> get

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
thirty percent damage increase you get

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.720 
thirty percent damage increase you get
from<00:02:44.420> elemental<00:02:44.870> activation<00:02:45.470> it<00:02:46.160> works<00:02:46.489> out

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
from elemental activation it works out

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:50.319 
from elemental activation it works out
for<00:02:46.970> me<00:02:47.000> at<00:02:47.420> roughly<00:02:47.870> 300<00:02:48.620> magic<00:02:49.340> damage<00:02:49.519> which

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
for me at roughly 300 magic damage which

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.240 
for me at roughly 300 magic damage which
is<00:02:50.540> almost<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.959> thousand<00:02:51.410> Dexter<00:02:51.799> absorb<00:02:52.069> on

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:52.250 
is almost a thousand Dexter absorb on

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.250 
is almost a thousand Dexter absorb on
