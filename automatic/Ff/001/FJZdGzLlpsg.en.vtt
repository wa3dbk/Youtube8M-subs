00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
all this is going to be a guide on how

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.390 
all this is going to be a guide on how
to<00:00:02.879> make<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.090> minecraft<00:00:03.570> SMP<00:00:04.049> server<00:00:04.380> on<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.100> Mac

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
to make a minecraft SMP server on a Mac

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.799 
to make a minecraft SMP server on a Mac
on<00:00:06.649> the<00:00:07.649> other<00:00:07.799> it<00:00:08.010> is<00:00:08.040> I<00:00:08.280> head<00:00:08.730> up<00:00:09.179> where<00:00:09.780> I

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
on the other it is I head up where I

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.120 
on the other it is I head up where I
guess<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> lot<00:00:10.440> of<00:00:10.469> people<00:00:10.530> didn't<00:00:10.980> quite

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
guess a lot of people didn't quite

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.640 
guess a lot of people didn't quite
understand<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.700> too<00:00:11.849> well<00:00:12.030> and<00:00:12.240> I<00:00:13.110> didn't<00:00:13.440> talk

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
understand it too well and I didn't talk

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.379 
understand it too well and I didn't talk
or<00:00:13.889> anything<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.460> hopefully<00:00:14.940> this<00:00:15.059> will<00:00:15.210> be<00:00:15.360> a

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
or anything so hopefully this will be a

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.390 
or anything so hopefully this will be a
lot<00:00:15.599> easier<00:00:15.809> for<00:00:16.350> people<00:00:16.440> to<00:00:16.619> understand<00:00:17.130> I'm

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
same port for the other one

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.600 
same port for the other one
and<00:02:13.840> then<00:02:13.990> just<00:02:14.140> apply<00:02:14.380> changes<00:02:14.890> when<00:02:15.490> you're

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
done and then that's pretty much it port

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.300 
done and then that's pretty much it port
forwarding<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.540> then<00:02:20.170> it's<00:02:20.860> exit<00:02:21.160> out<00:02:21.280> of

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
forwarding and then it's exit out of

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.570 
forwarding and then it's exit out of
