00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
connection site I thought modern warfare

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.740 
connection site I thought modern warfare
was<00:02:09.030> pretty<00:02:09.300> good<00:02:09.390> connections

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
was pretty good connections

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.930 
was pretty good connections
you<00:02:11.410> know<00:02:11.590> it<00:02:11.920> done<00:02:12.100> pretty<00:02:12.280> well<00:02:12.370> I<00:02:12.490> was<00:02:12.820> only

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
you know it done pretty well I was only

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.540

to<00:02:13.210> connect<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.600> everyone<00:02:13.900> here<00:02:14.290> everyone<00:02:14.740> so

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
to connect to everyone here everyone so

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:16.800 
to connect to everyone here everyone so
at<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.760> moment<00:02:15.910> I<00:02:16.120> feel<00:02:16.300> this<00:02:16.420> is<00:02:16.480> sort<00:02:16.780> of

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
at the moment I feel this is sort of

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.300 
at the moment I feel this is sort of
like<00:02:16.930> World<00:02:17.200> War<00:02:17.320> that's<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.770> same<00:02:17.980> problem<00:02:18.280> I

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
like World War that's the same problem I

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.430 
like World War that's the same problem I
had<00:02:18.460> word<00:02:18.730> award<00:02:18.970> endeavors<00:02:19.360> some<00:02:19.960> do<00:02:20.170> with<00:02:20.290> me

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
had word award endeavors some do with me

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
had word award endeavors some do with me
but<00:02:20.650> i'm<00:02:20.740> pretty<00:02:20.830> sure<00:02:21.010> it's<00:02:21.130> to<00:02:21.250> do<00:02:21.310> with<00:02:21.340> a

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
but i'm pretty sure it's to do with a

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.220 
but i'm pretty sure it's to do with a
game<00:02:21.610> because<00:02:21.850> I<00:02:22.390> just<00:02:22.630> can't<00:02:22.960> connect<00:02:23.170> to

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
game because I just can't connect to

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.450 
game because I just can't connect to
anyone<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.770> the<00:02:23.860> gains<00:02:24.040> keep<00:02:24.280> disconnecting

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
anyone and the gains keep disconnecting

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.720 
anyone and the gains keep disconnecting
but<00:02:25.300> obviously<00:02:26.140> it's<00:02:26.290> new<00:02:26.500> game<00:02:26.770> so<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.550> know

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
but obviously it's new game so you know

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.070 
but obviously it's new game so you know
it's<00:02:28.240> going<00:02:28.360> to<00:02:28.420> always<00:02:28.540> have<00:02:28.750> bugs<00:02:28.930> and

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
it's going to always have bugs and

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.500 
it's going to always have bugs and
glitches<00:02:29.140> but<00:02:29.740> when<00:02:30.730> I<00:02:30.760> do<00:02:30.880> get<00:02:31.090> into<00:02:31.240> again<00:02:31.480> I

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
glitches but when I do get into again I

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:33.390 
glitches but when I do get into again I

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:35.320 
obviously it's changed a lot 9 with sort

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.520 
obviously it's changed a lot 9 with sort
of<00:02:35.380> customization<00:02:36.130> you<00:02:36.970> obviously<00:02:37.810> have<00:02:38.380> to

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
of customization you obviously have to

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.350 
of customization you obviously have to
buy<00:02:38.680> or<00:02:39.040> your<00:02:39.340> knock<00:02:39.580> your<00:02:39.760> guns<00:02:39.910> like<00:02:40.090> normal

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
but then you have to buy them so you

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.140 
but then you have to buy them so you
earn<00:02:41.830> your<00:02:41.950> money<00:02:42.040> through<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.520> game<00:02:42.790> so<00:02:43.030> if

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
earn your money through the game so if

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:45.300 
earn your money through the game so if

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.850 
know how I feel about that i'll see it
makes<00:03:19.239> obviously<00:03:19.720> your<00:03:20.380> highest<00:03:20.650> killstreak

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.580 
makes obviously your highest killstreak
if<00:03:21.130> you<00:03:21.220> get<00:03:21.549> it's<00:03:21.670> like<00:03:21.700> 11<00:03:22.239> I<00:03:22.390> think<00:03:23.170> dogs<00:03:23.440> is

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
if you get it's like 11 I think dogs is

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
if you get it's like 11 I think dogs is
nine<00:03:23.799> I<00:03:23.830> think<00:03:24.130> there's<00:03:24.250> something<00:03:24.370> higher

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:24.610 
nine I think there's something higher

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.270 
nine I think there's something higher
than<00:03:24.640> dogs<00:03:25.060> so<00:03:25.870> you<00:03:25.930> know<00:03:26.230> nine<00:03:26.620> kills<00:03:26.890> and<00:03:27.130> too

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
than dogs so you know nine kills and too

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.620 
than dogs so you know nine kills and too
hard<00:03:27.310> to<00:03:27.549> get<00:03:27.730> but<00:03:27.850> black<00:03:28.090> ops<00:03:28.299> I<00:03:28.390> think<00:03:28.570> you

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
hard to get but black ops I think you

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.330 
hard to get but black ops I think you
die<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:28.870> lot<00:03:29.110> easier<00:03:29.320> on<00:03:29.560> black<00:03:29.769> ops<00:03:29.920> or<00:03:30.130> so<00:03:30.250> I'm

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
die a lot easier on black ops or so I'm

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:31.710 
die a lot easier on black ops or so I'm
still<00:03:30.549> not<00:03:30.640> used<00:03:30.700> it<00:03:31.090> so<00:03:31.239> I<00:03:31.269> haven't<00:03:31.540> been<00:03:31.600> able

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
some matches you know I think this is

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.040 
some matches you know I think this is
the<00:06:21.770> last<00:06:22.010> match<00:06:22.370> I've<00:06:22.580> recorded<00:06:22.970> so<00:06:23.330> far<00:06:23.360> I've

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
the last match I've recorded so far I've

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:25.870 
the last match I've recorded so far I've
only<00:06:24.200> recorded<00:06:24.650> what<00:06:24.800> six<00:06:25.160> matches<00:06:25.550> in<00:06:25.640> a<00:06:25.730> week

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:25.880 
only recorded what six matches in a week

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:26.800 
only recorded what six matches in a week
and<00:06:26.210> you<00:06:26.300> know

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
and you know

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.260 
and you know
so<00:06:27.350> it's<00:06:27.950> not<00:06:28.100> good<00:06:28.340> I<00:06:28.610> haven't<00:06:29.120> played<00:06:29.180> that

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
many games because of the lag and her

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.800
