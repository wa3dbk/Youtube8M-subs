00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.559
 hello everyone but it's fashionable 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.280
 and today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:18.040
 some quick tips to pass the 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:23.800
 beginners stage will say in the 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.450
 building charisma then no already a 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.570
 very handy thing in the 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:32.259
 construction to try to place a 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.770
 right object instead of relying on them 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.809
 like that two meters two days 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:41.679
 tried to put a flat object a little 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:43.269
 Freelance trick it's no it takes 

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:45.879
 push the button 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:48.100
 running that used key is there 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.219
 when you go see it will turn 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.949
 the object the own of only 25 degrees 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:57.969
 so up down and there he 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.879
 this frame automatically with respect to 

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:04.089
 ground and alongside know nothing of that 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.409
 I'm fine here it is very convenient 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:15.670
 if you want to put two objects next 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:18.070
 here after we have it too so you too 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.759
 are you at least inform a 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.820
 not very much 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:24.100
 you have all the tools here so and 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.909
 so you can associate two objects 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:31.000
 together so be you do like this 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.200
 that you put them next there I'm going 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.479
 try to put them as close 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.780
 possible what is still very very 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.780
 long go it's not very accurate after 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:45.700
 you use the option under 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.439
 sails at his table alas no no you 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.740
 will you see the two supports are 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:54.430
 hung but there are many more 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.930
 easy there are a lot easier go 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.299
 you place them in the same direction if 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.740
 you manage but in the same sense these 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.420
 two flat here while I want them 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:07.390
 put one after the other 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.700
 use it option the tool precision 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.090
 that she finds you on the workshop is 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.010
 a very very indispensable tool 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.810
 so here I have several all fashion in 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.540
 done I was several modes I have the 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:26.230
 Apps mode have ranked the precision mode 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:31.900
 agree with the right click 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:35.080
 you can grow the wheat a lot its 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.989
 body is a lot less you have 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.510
 the object rotating well for the butcher 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.660
 move and we what interests us is 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.630
 the weld option the fourth option so 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.290
 and leave you the strength that you leave 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.870
 quite actually 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.700
 so the mom when you go aim a 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.560
 props you'll see a little frame there 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.920
 buy her daughter so I want 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:00.250
 the winger by the side by the end end here 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.680
 so I want I want for example related 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.930
 by that side there but there it is 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:11.879
 very difficult revised then you have or 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:15.579
 the target is where you 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:18.190
 the weld you have you are going to pray on 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.440
 them so on the key used for me 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.109
 here 's going to do a simple right click 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.230
 there he will become ghost lay wanted 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:29.170
 see it is at the end of your your pool 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.010
 of the want you again you're aiming there 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.310
 where you want to put it 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.700
 so here to press once there you 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.040
 can rotate it for example the 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.950
 and to ask them is where are 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:45.780
 completely welded together with one 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:49.209
 accuracy very high accuracy 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.919
 it's very handy to do 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:52.810
 anything constructions 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:54.579
 could make buildings like 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.440
 you want it if you want to make 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:59.530
 angles it's also very simple you 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.870
 put like that like that boom 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.329
 but instead of taking in the middle of 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.319
 side you're going to take on the fair on 

00:04:04.329 --> 00:04:11.739
 the angle for example here the up 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:13.510
 or some bugs will weld then you 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.900
 go put on the other side at the same 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:18.430
 place tac and haye and there you go 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.190
 see this going to work it must 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.530
 you press the windows key that 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.889
 you have configured and that's fine 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.750
 to put 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.550
 like it was finally going to put it 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.940
 in the same position that you have it 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:33.180
 put lately 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.889
 here we have a nice place where it's not that 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:40.120
 we thaw it boom 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:42.130
 we have a very nice angle and we know very well 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.060
 practice by the NGO if you are in 

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:49.330
 archers servers rhdp for example if 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:51.070
 you want a council go will be from 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.199
 know who's called my dark harper whose 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.370
 you put it in the description he 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:56.169
 is huge social 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.289
 so here is if you want to create 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.949
 arms stores and for example or 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:04.900
 anything is very handy 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.970
 I hope you have learned 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.099
 something today ten months in 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.930
 the comments do not forget the 

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:13.960
 high schools where is it if it makes you 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.590
 pleasure and we'll meet soon for 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.190
