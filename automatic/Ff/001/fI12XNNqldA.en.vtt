now look at all these secondary root

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.479 
now look at all these secondary root
system<00:00:58.109> that's<00:00:58.260> really<00:00:58.829> something<00:00:59.190> isn't<00:00:59.309> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489

isn't<00:01:01.320> good<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.859> indicates<00:01:02.399> that<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.789> primary

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
isn't good it indicates that the primary

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.420 
isn't good it indicates that the primary
root<00:01:03.480> system<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:03.960> suffocated<00:01:04.619> down<00:01:04.799> below<00:01:05.129> and

any<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.049> bark<00:01:40.290> falling<00:01:40.710> off<00:01:40.860> I'd<00:01:41.430> start

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
any of the bark falling off I'd start

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.940 
any of the bark falling off I'd start
out<00:01:41.970> by<00:01:42.180> removing<00:01:42.689> all<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.020> mulch<00:01:43.290> let's<00:01:43.799> get

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
out by removing all this mulch let's get

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.370 
out by removing all this mulch let's get
to<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:47.479> well<00:01:48.479> that's<00:01:48.659> about<00:01:48.869> all<00:01:48.930> we'll<00:01:49.229> do

with the hand tools Roger the rest of it

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.100 
with the hand tools Roger the rest of it
we'll<00:01:51.299> take<00:01:51.450> out<00:01:51.689> with<00:01:51.840> a<00:01:52.009> power<00:01:53.009> tool<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:54.110> have

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
we'll take out with a power tool I have

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.800 
we'll take out with a power tool I have
a<00:01:55.259> compressor<00:01:55.829> here<00:01:56.240> then<00:01:57.240> I'm<00:01:57.360> going<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.570> fire

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
a compressor here then I'm going to fire

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.780 
a compressor here then I'm going to fire
up

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:00.790 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.280

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
then confess here down the blinds in the

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.030 
then confess here down the blinds in the
pool<00:02:03.530> which<00:02:04.310> was<00:02:04.340> going<00:02:04.670> to<00:02:04.759> use<00:02:04.970> the<00:02:05.329> black

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
pool which was going to use the black

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.710 
pool which was going to use the black
mulch<00:02:07.040> and<00:02:07.280> soil<00:02:07.580> off<00:02:08.000> the<00:02:08.060> tree<00:02:08.630> be

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.050 

the<00:02:12.050> air<00:02:12.230> one<00:02:12.470> removes<00:02:12.950> all<00:02:13.190> the<00:02:13.220> soil<00:02:13.670> but<00:02:13.910> it

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
the air one removes all the soil but it

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.440 
the air one removes all the soil but it
doesn't<00:02:14.420> damage<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.020> roots<00:02:15.230> or<00:02:15.500> the<00:02:15.740> tree<00:02:16.450> you

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
doesn't damage the roots or the tree you

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.480 
doesn't damage the roots or the tree you
can<00:02:17.600> actually<00:02:17.780> see<00:02:18.170> the<00:02:18.320> wire<00:02:18.560> baskets<00:02:19.340> the

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:19.490 
can actually see the wire baskets the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.070 
can actually see the wire baskets the
remnants<00:02:20.000> of<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.270> left<00:02:20.480> via<00:02:20.720> from<00:02:20.960> the

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
remnants of it left via from the

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:24.789 
remnants of it left via from the
original<00:02:21.530> plantain

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.470 

well<00:02:25.799> Matt<00:02:25.980> now<00:02:26.219> we<00:02:26.280> can<00:02:26.579> really<00:02:27.030> see<00:02:27.450> that

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
well Matt now we can really see that

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.750 
well Matt now we can really see that
root<00:02:28.019> flare<00:02:28.319> right<00:02:28.590> there<00:02:28.859> yeah<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:29.609> all

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
root flare right there yeah and all

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.369 
root flare right there yeah and all
these<00:02:29.939> secondary<00:02:30.389> roots<00:02:30.689> that<00:02:30.870> are<00:02:30.930> coming<00:02:31.290> up

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
these secondary roots that are coming up

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:33.080 
these secondary roots that are coming up
right<00:02:31.620> here<00:02:31.650> this<00:02:31.859> one's<00:02:32.040> crossing<00:02:32.549> rate<00:02:32.760> over

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
right here this one's crossing rate over

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.429 
right here this one's crossing rate over
the<00:02:33.120> flare<00:02:33.420> that<00:02:33.629> would<00:02:33.749> be<00:02:33.870> a<00:02:33.900> problem<00:02:34.170> in<00:02:34.349> the

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:34.439 
the flare that would be a problem in the

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:36.110 
the flare that would be a problem in the
future<00:02:34.590> wouldn't<00:02:35.040> it<00:02:35.099> we're<00:02:35.730> going<00:02:35.819> to<00:02:35.939> cut

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
future wouldn't it we're going to cut

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.300 
future wouldn't it we're going to cut
all<00:02:36.420> these<00:02:36.599> roots<00:02:36.870> off<00:02:37.079> that<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.349> going<00:02:37.620> up<00:02:37.769> so

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
all these roots off that it going up so

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.190 
all these roots off that it going up so
anything<00:02:38.790> coming<00:02:38.999> up<00:02:39.150> gets<00:02:39.420> cut<00:02:39.659> right<00:02:40.230> okay

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
anything coming up gets cut right okay

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.399 
anything coming up gets cut right okay
okay

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
okay

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:46.129 
okay
whoop<00:02:43.920> we<00:02:44.519> got<00:02:44.670> just<00:02:44.909> a<00:02:45.000> few<00:02:45.030> more<00:02:45.359> to<00:02:45.450> go<00:02:45.480> yeah

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
whoop we got just a few more to go yeah

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.920 
whoop we got just a few more to go yeah
it's<00:02:46.290> looking<00:02:46.530> good<00:02:46.680> now<00:02:46.889> now<00:02:47.840> with<00:02:48.840> the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
it's looking good now now with the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.569 
it's looking good now now with the
secondary<00:02:49.409> route<00:02:49.650> system<00:02:49.859> gone<00:02:50.219> you<00:02:50.400> can

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:50.579 
secondary route system gone you can

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:52.970 
secondary route system gone you can
really<00:02:51.120> see<00:02:51.329> that<00:02:51.540> primary<00:02:52.109> flare<00:02:52.560> and<00:02:52.859> how

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
really see that primary flare and how

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.420 
really see that primary flare and how
it's<00:02:53.189> it's<00:02:53.489> rate<00:02:53.999> at<00:02:54.150> ground<00:02:54.419> level<00:02:55.310> all<00:02:56.310> right

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
it's it's rate at ground level all right

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.979 
it's it's rate at ground level all right
we<00:02:56.609> just<00:02:56.730> want<00:02:56.849> to<00:02:57.090> add<00:02:57.269> a<00:02:57.299> little<00:02:57.689> bit<00:02:57.959> of

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
we just want to add a little bit of

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.959 
we just want to add a little bit of
topsoil<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.709> fill<00:02:59.010> in<00:02:59.189> some<00:02:59.519> of<00:02:59.669> the<00:02:59.730> voids

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
topsoil to fill in some of the voids

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:02.869 
topsoil to fill in some of the voids
around<00:03:00.419> the<00:03:00.599> tree<00:03:00.930> remember<00:03:01.650> we<00:03:01.980> do<00:03:02.129> not<00:03:02.430> want

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
around the tree remember we do not want

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.599 
around the tree remember we do not want
to<00:03:03.000> cover<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.449> primary<00:03:03.959> root<00:03:04.260> flare<00:03:04.609> now

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:05.609 
to cover the primary root flare now

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:07.640 
to cover the primary root flare now
we're<00:03:05.879> ready<00:03:06.060> for<00:03:06.329> mulch<00:03:06.569> but<00:03:07.019> no<00:03:07.319> more

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
we're ready for mulch but no more

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.189 
we're ready for mulch but no more
volcanoes<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.699> don't<00:03:09.389> like<00:03:09.480> to<00:03:09.599> just<00:03:09.780> dump<00:03:10.079> the

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:10.199 
volcanoes I don't like to just dump the

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:12.140 
volcanoes I don't like to just dump the
whole<00:03:10.379> wheel<00:03:10.590> barrel<00:03:11.010> on<00:03:11.159> there<00:03:11.430> I<00:03:11.639> like<00:03:12.090> to

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
whole wheel barrel on there I like to

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.909 
whole wheel barrel on there I like to
put<00:03:12.359> it<00:03:12.449> on<00:03:12.540> by<00:03:12.689> hand<00:03:13.019> so<00:03:13.230> we<00:03:13.319> can<00:03:13.349> gauge<00:03:13.680> the

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:13.919 
put it on by hand so we can gauge the

00:03:13.919 --> 00:03:15.259 
put it on by hand so we can gauge the
depth<00:03:14.159> and<00:03:14.310> make<00:03:14.459> sure<00:03:14.639> we<00:03:14.760> don't<00:03:14.849> have<00:03:15.030> much

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
depth and make sure we don't have much

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:22.729 
depth and make sure we don't have much
more<00:03:15.480> than<00:03:15.540> two<00:03:15.810> inches<00:03:21.230> the<00:03:22.230> mulch<00:03:22.439> is

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
more than two inches the mulch is

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.500 
more than two inches the mulch is
important<00:03:23.400> for<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.579> couple<00:03:23.819> of<00:03:24.030> reasons

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
important for a couple of reasons

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.509 
important for a couple of reasons
it<00:03:24.810> keeps<00:03:25.019> the<00:03:25.169> grass<00:03:25.379> from<00:03:25.650> growing<00:03:26.040> up<00:03:26.159> next

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
it keeps the grass from growing up next

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.490 
it keeps the grass from growing up next
to<00:03:26.639> the<00:03:26.790> tree<00:03:27.030> it<00:03:27.389> holds<00:03:27.870> moisture<00:03:28.019> in<00:03:28.409> the

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
to the tree it holds moisture in the

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.469 
to the tree it holds moisture in the
soil<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.400> also<00:03:29.579> keeps<00:03:29.970> weeds<00:03:30.269> from

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:30.479 
soil and it also keeps weeds from

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.569 
soil and it also keeps weeds from
popping<00:03:30.930> up<00:03:31.049> and<00:03:31.290> most<00:03:31.709> importantly<00:03:32.340> we're

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
popping up and most importantly we're

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:35.059 
popping up and most importantly we're
not<00:03:32.759> covering<00:03:33.180> up<00:03:33.389> the<00:03:33.569> root<00:03:33.780> flare<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.889> way

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
not covering up the root flare the way

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:38.440 
not covering up the root flare the way
