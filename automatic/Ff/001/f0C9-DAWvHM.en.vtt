the first is our fast rides so the Finns

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.170 
the first is our fast rides so the Finns
their<00:00:53.860> whole<00:00:54.040> essence<00:00:54.610> of<00:00:54.729> running<00:00:55.000> is<00:00:55.089> about

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
their whole essence of running is about

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.210 
their whole essence of running is about
roll<00:00:55.510> forward<00:00:56.049> so<00:00:56.440> we<00:00:56.470> have<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.830> fulcrum

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
roll forward so we have the fulcrum

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.549 
roll forward so we have the fulcrum
technology<00:00:57.879> which<00:00:58.570> basically<00:00:59.019> is<00:00:59.170> like<00:00:59.290> a

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
technology which basically is like a

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.009 
technology which basically is like a
seesaw<00:00:59.860> you<00:01:00.250> pivot<00:01:00.640> over<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:01.479> fulcrum<00:01:01.900> you

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
seesaw you pivot over the fulcrum you

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:04.170 
seesaw you pivot over the fulcrum you
transition<00:01:02.710> your<00:01:02.830> your<00:01:03.250> weight<00:01:03.640> into<00:01:03.940> the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
transition your your weight into the

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.330 
transition your your weight into the
floor<00:01:04.390> foot<00:01:04.629> to<00:01:04.809> get<00:01:04.930> into<00:01:05.170> toe<00:01:05.320> off<00:01:05.560> and<00:01:06.130> so

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
floor foot to get into toe off and so

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.039 
floor foot to get into toe off and so
that<00:01:06.369> is<00:01:06.640> the<00:01:06.790> essence<00:01:07.240> of<00:01:07.360> it<00:01:07.479> and<00:01:07.659> then<00:01:07.840> from

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
that is the essence of it and then from

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:09.990 
that is the essence of it and then from
an<00:01:08.200> upper<00:01:08.500> standpoint<00:01:09.010> it's<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.610> less<00:01:09.790> is

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
an upper standpoint it's the less is

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.760 
an upper standpoint it's the less is
better<00:01:10.210> you<00:01:10.840> know<00:01:10.930> everything<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:11.619> need

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:11.770 
better you know everything you need

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.710 
better you know everything you need
nothing<00:01:12.190> you<00:01:12.280> don't<00:01:12.460> so<00:01:12.970> that's<00:01:13.150> our<00:01:13.360> design

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
nothing you don't so that's our design

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.630 
nothing you don't so that's our design
philosophy<00:01:14.350> so<00:01:14.799> you<00:01:14.860> can<00:01:14.950> see<00:01:15.100> here<00:01:15.310> this<00:01:15.460> is

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
philosophy so you can see here this is

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.810 
philosophy so you can see here this is
our<00:01:15.820> spring<00:01:16.090> 11<00:01:16.420> fast<00:01:17.170> ride<00:01:17.560> and<00:01:18.310> it's<00:01:18.460> got<00:01:18.640> our

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
our spring 11 fast ride and it's got our

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.090 
our spring 11 fast ride and it's got our
newest<00:01:19.329> fulcrum<00:01:19.990> in<00:01:20.109> it<00:01:20.259> and<00:01:20.439> here<00:01:20.950> we've<00:01:21.070> got

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
newest fulcrum in it and here we've got

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.279 
newest fulcrum in it and here we've got
a<00:01:21.219> nice<00:01:21.430> blown<00:01:21.700> rubber<00:01:21.939> forefoot<00:01:22.539> so<00:01:22.840> we've

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
a nice blown rubber forefoot so we've

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.649 
a nice blown rubber forefoot so we've
done<00:01:23.500> some<00:01:23.740> dynamic<00:01:24.219> testing<00:01:24.579> on<00:01:24.759> this<00:01:24.939> and

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:25.659 
done some dynamic testing on this and

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:27.569 
done some dynamic testing on this and
the<00:01:25.899> results<00:01:26.380> have<00:01:26.439> proven<00:01:26.920> that<00:01:26.979> car<00:01:27.369> who

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:27.579 
the results have proven that car who

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.880 
the results have proven that car who
really<00:01:28.180> does<00:01:28.539> help<00:01:28.780> you<00:01:28.930> move<00:01:29.079> forward<00:01:29.109> you

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
really does help you move forward you

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.889 
really does help you move forward you
don't<00:01:30.130> bounce<00:01:30.579> up<00:01:30.909> and<00:01:31.030> down<00:01:31.119> as<00:01:31.420> much<00:01:31.600> of<00:01:31.750> it

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
don't bounce up and down as much of it

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.080 
don't bounce up and down as much of it
okay<00:01:32.170> so<00:01:32.229> lower<00:01:32.560> vertical<00:01:33.100> oscillation<00:01:33.640> so

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
okay so lower vertical oscillation so

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.749 
okay so lower vertical oscillation so
this<00:01:34.240> is<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.420> new<00:01:34.600> fast<00:01:35.219> and<00:01:36.219> this<00:01:36.369> is<00:01:36.520> the

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759
