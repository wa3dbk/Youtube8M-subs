00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.330 

okay<00:00:01.380> so<00:00:01.439> we<00:00:01.680> have<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:01.829> DV<00:00:02.990> 9700<00:00:03.990> here<00:00:04.230> that

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:07.340 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.290 

appears<00:00:08.340> that<00:00:08.610> it<00:00:08.820> accepts<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:09.750> adapter<00:00:11.300> and

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
appears that it accepts the adapter and

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.310 
appears that it accepts the adapter and
it<00:00:12.929> looks<00:00:13.230> like<00:00:13.349> it's<00:00:13.679> charging<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.429> battery

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
it looks like it's charging the battery

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.570 
it looks like it's charging the battery
but<00:00:16.320> what<00:00:16.500> we're<00:00:16.619> gonna<00:00:16.770> do<00:00:16.949> is<00:00:17.130> press<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
but what we're gonna do is press the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.710 
but what we're gonna do is press the
power<00:00:17.760> button<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.630> see<00:00:18.810> what<00:00:18.960> happens<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:20.720> we

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
power button and see what happens so we

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.240 
power button and see what happens so we
press<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> power<00:00:22.230> button<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.619> we<00:00:22.830> see<00:00:23.070> that

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
press the power button and we see that

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.990 
press the power button and we see that
the<00:00:23.400> lights<00:00:25.160> flickered<00:00:26.160> on<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.609> then<00:00:26.760> turned

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the lights flickered on and then turned

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.930 
the lights flickered on and then turned
right<00:00:27.180> off<00:00:27.859> and<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.160> adapter<00:00:29.699> still<00:00:30.029> stays<00:00:30.359> on

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
right off and the adapter still stays on

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.290 
right off and the adapter still stays on
so<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.270> have<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:35.390> power<00:00:36.390> issue<00:00:36.719> on<00:00:37.440> the<00:00:37.920> board<00:00:38.300> so

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
so we have a power issue on the board so

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.670 
so we have a power issue on the board so
what<00:00:39.510> we're<00:00:39.629> gonna<00:00:39.719> need<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.050> do<00:00:40.140> is<00:00:40.320> take<00:00:40.530> this

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
what we're gonna need to do is take this

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.869 
what we're gonna need to do is take this
apart<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.420> see<00:00:42.420> what<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.690> can<00:00:42.870> find<00:00:43.079> out<00:00:43.879> from

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
apart and see what we can find out from

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.799 
apart and see what we can find out from
the<00:00:45.090> actual<00:00:45.510> laptop<00:00:46.940> so<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.120> we've<00:00:48.300> done<00:00:48.510> is

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
the actual laptop so what we've done is

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.380 
the actual laptop so what we've done is
take<00:00:49.620> it<00:00:49.770> our<00:00:49.860> system<00:00:50.250> out<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.789> what<00:00:51.270> we

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
take it our system out and what we

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.209 
take it our system out and what we
notice<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.930> that<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.350> boots<00:00:53.600> we<00:00:54.600> get<00:00:54.750> video<00:00:55.219> but

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
notice is that it boots we get video but

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.670 
notice is that it boots we get video but
that's<00:00:56.399> only<00:00:56.610> after<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.360> took<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> processor

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
that's only after we took the processor

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.330 
that's only after we took the processor
and<00:00:58.829> exchanged<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.320> our<00:01:01.320> memory<00:01:01.890> hasn't

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
and exchanged it so our memory hasn't

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.450 
and exchanged it so our memory hasn't
been<00:01:02.460> tested<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.270> we<00:01:03.750> see<00:01:04.019> that<00:01:04.129> once<00:01:05.129> we<00:01:05.309> took

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
been tested but we see that once we took

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.870 
been tested but we see that once we took
the<00:01:05.519> processor<00:01:06.180> out<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:07.439> system<00:01:07.890> will<00:01:08.130> power

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
the processor out the system will power

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.100 
the processor out the system will power
on<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.560> it<00:01:10.560> goes<00:01:10.770> to<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:12.210> actual<00:01:12.540> BIOS<00:01:12.930> screen

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
on and it goes to the actual BIOS screen

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.340 
on and it goes to the actual BIOS screen
so<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:13.830> know<00:01:14.130> that<00:01:14.570> the<00:01:15.570> system<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.080> actually

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
so we know that the system is actually

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.399 
so we know that the system is actually
booting<00:01:17.150> and<00:01:18.150> we<00:01:18.270> know<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.659> it'll<00:01:18.840> go<00:01:19.110> into

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
booting and we know that it'll go into

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.190 
booting and we know that it'll go into
the<00:01:19.500> BIOS<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.330> quite<00:01:21.330> possibly<00:01:21.540> you'll<00:01:22.020> go

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
the BIOS and quite possibly you'll go

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.490 
the BIOS and quite possibly you'll go
into<00:01:22.409> operating<00:01:22.950> system<00:01:23.540> but<00:01:24.540> we<00:01:24.780> see<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.320> it

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
into operating system but we see that it

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.660 
into operating system but we see that it
is<00:01:25.939> started<00:01:26.939> up<00:01:27.090> perfectly<00:01:27.540> fine<00:01:27.810> no<00:01:28.110> more

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
is started up perfectly fine no more

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.780 
is started up perfectly fine no more
short<00:01:29.670> cut<00:01:30.119> off<00:01:30.270> short<00:01:30.780> cut<00:01:31.079> off<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:32.490> what

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
short cut off short cut off so what

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.780 
short cut off short cut off so what
we're<00:01:32.939> gonna<00:01:33.030> do<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.890> take<00:01:34.890> this<00:01:35.100> processor

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
we're gonna do is take this processor

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.200 
we're gonna do is take this processor
and<00:01:36.530> put<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.680> into<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.130> system<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.729> see<00:01:39.030> what

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and put it into the system and see what

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.590 
and put it into the system and see what
happens<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:39.990> replicates<00:01:41.180> and<00:01:42.180> that's<00:01:42.420> what

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
happens if it replicates and that's what

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.990 
happens if it replicates and that's what
we'll<00:01:42.750> do<00:01:42.899> here<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.380> second<00:01:43.770> so<00:01:43.950> the<00:01:44.820> further

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
we'll do here in a second so the further

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.270 
we'll do here in a second so the further
test<00:01:45.479> our<00:01:45.689> system<00:01:46.110> we<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.829> put<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.250> whole

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
test our system we have put the whole

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.200 
test our system we have put the whole
processor<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.649> taking<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.890> new<00:01:50.850> one<00:01:51.060> out

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
processor in and taking the new one out

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.359 
processor in and taking the new one out
and<00:01:51.770> so<00:01:52.770> we're<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.310> take<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:55.369> heatsink

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
and so we're going to take the heatsink

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.359 
and so we're going to take the heatsink
here<00:01:56.990> see<00:01:57.990> if<00:01:58.049> I<00:01:58.229> can't<00:01:58.469> aim<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.950> with<00:01:59.159> one

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
here see if I can't aim this with one

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.120 
here see if I can't aim this with one
hand

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.630 

and<00:02:02.390> get<00:02:03.390> this<00:02:03.540> heatsink<00:02:04.080> on<00:02:04.260> there<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.610> that

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
and get this heatsink on there so that

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.620 
and get this heatsink on there so that
we<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.150> bolt<00:02:06.600> it<00:02:06.750> down<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:08.210> go<00:02:09.210> from<00:02:09.450> there

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
we can bolt it down and go from there

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.449 
we can bolt it down and go from there
and<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:09.960> what<00:02:10.140> we<00:02:10.170> get<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:12.470> our<00:02:13.470> theory<00:02:14.040> is

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
and see what we get so our theory is

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.500 
and see what we get so our theory is
that<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.660> processor<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.410> what's<00:02:16.800> caused<00:02:17.510> the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
that the processor is what's caused the

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.380 
that the processor is what's caused the
short<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:20.000> the<00:02:21.000> system<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.690> fail<00:02:22.280> so<00:02:23.390> what

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
short and the system to fail so what

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.410 
short and the system to fail so what
we're<00:02:24.570> going<00:02:24.720> to<00:02:24.900> do<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.940> test<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.150> theory

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
we're going to do is test that theory

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.250 
we're going to do is test that theory
out<00:02:28.730> by<00:02:29.730> putting<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.240> whole<00:02:30.390> processor<00:02:31.080> in

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
out by putting the whole processor in

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.780 
out by putting the whole processor in
and<00:02:31.500> seeing<00:02:32.280> what<00:02:32.490> we<00:02:32.640> find<00:02:34.100> most<00:02:35.100> likely<00:02:35.580> we

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
and seeing what we find most likely we

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.050 
and seeing what we find most likely we
will<00:02:35.970> find<00:02:36.270> that<00:02:37.370> there<00:02:38.370> may<00:02:38.580> be<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.760> remote

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
will find that there may be a remote

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.370 
will find that there may be a remote
possibility<00:02:39.330> that<00:02:40.020> we<00:02:40.260> do<00:02:40.590> not<00:02:40.739> find<00:02:41.010> that

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
possibility that we do not find that

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.020 
possibility that we do not find that
which<00:02:43.380> has<00:02:43.830> happened<00:02:44.250> in<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.430> past<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:44.850> what

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
which has happened in the past so what

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.050 
which has happened in the past so what
we're<00:02:45.150> gonna<00:02:45.239> do<00:02:45.480> is<00:02:45.690> take<00:02:45.930> our<00:02:46.110> power<00:02:46.410> and

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
we're gonna do is take our power and

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
we're gonna do is take our power and
plug<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.180> in<00:02:51.620> we've<00:02:52.620> got<00:02:52.890> it<00:02:53.070> going<00:02:53.100> in<00:02:53.989> and<00:02:54.989> now

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
plug it in we've got it going in and now

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.259 
plug it in we've got it going in and now
we're<00:02:55.230> gonna<00:02:55.320> push<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.830> power<00:02:56.700> button<00:02:56.850> and

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269 
we're gonna push the power button and

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:59.030 
we're gonna push the power button and
see<00:02:57.420> what<00:02:57.450> happens

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
see what happens

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.790 
see what happens
quick<00:02:59.580> on-off<00:03:00.830> just<00:03:01.830> as<00:03:02.010> before<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.800> it

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 
quick on-off just as before and it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.640 
quick on-off just as before and it
doesn't<00:03:05.160> rapid<00:03:05.580> succession<00:03:06.030> every<00:03:06.420> time<00:03:06.650> so

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
doesn't rapid succession every time so

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.160 
doesn't rapid succession every time so
we<00:03:07.799> know<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.070> the<00:03:08.430> processor<00:03:09.120> was<00:03:09.450> most

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
we know that the processor was most

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.920 
we know that the processor was most
likely<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.650> issue<00:03:11.190> with<00:03:11.489> this<00:03:11.610> machine<00:03:12.030> so

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
likely the issue with this machine so

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.770 
likely the issue with this machine so
what<00:03:13.170> we're<00:03:13.320> gonna<00:03:13.410> do<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:14.540> put<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.630> new

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
what we're gonna do is put the new

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.620 
what we're gonna do is put the new
processor<00:03:16.410> in<00:03:16.560> build<00:03:17.459> the<00:03:17.670> machine<00:03:18.030> back<00:03:18.239> and

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
processor in build the machine back and

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.840 
processor in build the machine back and
see<00:03:19.350> if<00:03:19.440> we<00:03:19.590> can't<00:03:19.829> get<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.250> to<00:03:20.900> actually<00:03:22.850> boot

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
see if we can't get it to actually boot

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.310 
see if we can't get it to actually boot
up<00:03:24.030> in<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.329> windows<00:03:24.630> and<00:03:24.660> do<00:03:25.019> what<00:03:25.200> it<00:03:25.290> needs

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
up in the windows and do what it needs

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.860 
up in the windows and do what it needs
to<00:03:25.590> do
