control that we need for that patient in
this<00:00:45.629> case<00:00:45.690> when<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.170> patient<00:00:46.590> actually<00:00:47.399> stands

this case when a patient actually stands

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.520 
this case when a patient actually stands
on<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.280> custom<00:00:50.280> molded<00:00:50.550> orthotic<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.899> keeps

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
on the custom molded orthotic it keeps

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.310 
on the custom molded orthotic it keeps
the<00:00:52.710> heel<00:00:52.920> bone<00:00:53.100> aligned<00:00:53.520> properly<00:00:54.140> makes<00:00:55.140> up

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
the heel bone aligned properly makes up

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.600 
the heel bone aligned properly makes up
for<00:00:55.500> any<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> biomechanical

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
for any of the biomechanical

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.000 
for any of the biomechanical
inefficiencies<00:00:57.210> that<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.989> patient<00:00:58.379> just

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
inefficiencies that the patient just

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.040 
inefficiencies that the patient just
happened<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.550> born<00:00:59.730> with<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.300> controls

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
happened to be born with and controls

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.689 
happened to be born with and controls
all<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.440> abnormal<00:01:02.039> pronation<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
all that abnormal pronation and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.100 
all that abnormal pronation and
supination<00:01:05.420> so<00:01:06.420> one<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> questions<00:01:06.810> I

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
supination so one of the questions I

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.390 
supination so one of the questions I
often<00:01:07.290> get<00:01:07.560> is<00:01:07.710> what<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:08.070> difference

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
often get is what is the difference

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.789 
often get is what is the difference
between<00:01:08.430> pronation<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.360> supination<00:01:09.799> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
between pronation and supination the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.320 
between pronation and supination the
easiest<00:01:11.070> way<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.310> illustrate<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:11.939> is<00:01:12.090> to

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
easiest way to illustrate that is to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.060 
easiest way to illustrate that is to
draw<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> line<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> back<00:01:13.380> of<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.710> Achilles

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
draw a line on the back of the Achilles

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.370 
draw a line on the back of the Achilles
tendon<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.299> representative<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.140> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
tendon that it's representative of the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.530 
tendon that it's representative of the
orientation<00:01:17.310> of<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> leg<00:01:17.670> whereas<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> line<00:01:18.360> on

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
orientation of the leg whereas a line on

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.240 
orientation of the leg whereas a line on
the<00:01:18.600> back<00:01:18.750> of<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> heel<00:01:19.229> really<00:01:19.590> represents

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
the back of the heel really represents

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.300 
the back of the heel really represents
the<00:01:20.580> foot<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.390> pronation<00:01:22.350> really<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.100> when

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
the foot and pronation really is when

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.149 
the foot and pronation really is when
the<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.939> inside<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> ankle<00:01:24.869> rolls<00:01:25.530> inward

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
the the inside of the ankle rolls inward

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.060 
the the inside of the ankle rolls inward
and<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.640> heel<00:01:26.880> bone<00:01:27.090> tilts<00:01:27.600> over<00:01:28.070> supination

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and the heel bone tilts over supination

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.950 
and the heel bone tilts over supination
is<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.460> opposite<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.420> where<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.810> heel

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
is the opposite of that where the heel

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.390 
is the opposite of that where the heel
bone<00:01:31.170> is<00:01:31.460> rolling<00:01:32.460> outward<00:01:33.290> and<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.250> see

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
bone is rolling outward and you can see

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.859 
bone is rolling outward and you can see
the<00:01:35.520> change<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.000> alignment<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.600> leg

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
the change in the alignment in the leg

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.780 
the change in the alignment in the leg
supination<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.920> what<00:01:38.130> happens<00:01:38.520> when<00:01:38.670> you're

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
supination is what happens when you're

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.219 
supination is what happens when you're
pushing<00:01:39.150> off<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.570> that's<00:01:39.689> what<00:01:39.900> makes<00:01:40.110> your

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
pushing off and that's what makes your

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.670 
pushing off and that's what makes your
foot<00:01:40.439> rigid<00:01:41.030> pronation<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.390> what<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
foot rigid pronation is what you do to

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.039 
foot rigid pronation is what you do to
absorb<00:01:44.130> impact<00:01:44.460> when<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.119> land<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.780> you're

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
absorb impact when you land and you're

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.260 
absorb impact when you land and you're
running<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.590> walking<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:47.759> as<00:01:47.909> your<00:01:48.060> foot

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
running or walking and so as your foot

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.840 
running or walking and so as your foot
rolls<00:01:48.509> inward<00:01:49.079> you<00:01:49.320> absorb<00:01:49.920> impact<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:50.729> you

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
rolls inward you absorb impact but you

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.550 
rolls inward you absorb impact but you
can<00:01:51.000> see<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.360> loss<00:01:51.570> of<00:01:51.810> your<00:01:51.930> arch<00:01:52.229> height

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
can see the loss of your arch height

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.399 
can see the loss of your arch height
that<00:01:53.220> happens<00:01:53.729> when<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.149> pronate<00:01:54.450> so<00:01:55.259> when

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
that happens when you pronate so when

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.959 
that happens when you pronate so when
someone<00:01:55.710> says<00:01:55.950> you're<00:01:56.130> an<00:01:56.219> over<00:01:56.460> pronator

someone says you're an over pronator

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.730 
someone says you're an over pronator
it's<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> loss<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.259> are<00:01:58.439> tight

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
it's really the loss of the are tight

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.969 
it's really the loss of the are tight
and<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.460> tilting<00:01:59.939> over<00:02:00.030> of<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.420> heel<00:02:00.689> bone

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
and the tilting over of the heel bone

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.920 
and the tilting over of the heel bone
that<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.250> what<00:02:02.820> people<00:02:03.119> are<00:02:03.210> referring<00:02:03.299> to<00:02:03.659> as

that is what people are referring to as

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.719

actually use the orthotics as a

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.189 
actually use the orthotics as a
replacement<00:03:27.150> device<00:03:27.239> so<00:03:27.780> you'll<00:03:27.930> want<00:03:28.139> to

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:28.199 
replacement device so you'll want to

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.990
