00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:05.590
 hello everyone i am want in del 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:07.990
 channel overload 1000 and I'm here with a 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.570
 commented gameplay of warcraft 3 and 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.059
 we change the player change us 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.790
 player and I'm with a gameplay of 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.460
 humans as you could see there in the 

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.730
 loading screen and I playing with 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.890
 humans and the truth that you have 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.439
 any request for the channel and others and 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.620
 good why why not be the day today 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.320
 in which you choose humans 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.960
 it's a gameplay in which the one that ended 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.870
 losing a little pathetic his games 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.820
 of orphan losing to the channel but it was 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.530
 more than anything because of the subject I wanted 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.120
 comment the truth the humans not the 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.520
 pilot right now to win 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.460
 one in three games but for 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:51.030
 commenting on the subject I'm worth this temple was going 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:54.120
 the strategy section is valid but not 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.440
 is a specific strategy but that 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.239
 it's just I wanted to talk is the process 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.879
 whereby we each choose the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.090
 strategy that we develop in the 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.760
 gameplay not and that by not knowing not knowing 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.610
 choose it and not do it well my enemy 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.010
 wins and I lose since my enemy 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.520
 He chose the strategy magnificently 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.950
 really 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.350
 explore the subject of much gigs 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.689
 my base see what I had because I did not have and 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.289
 from there you can develop a 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:30.270
 Tactics in addition and good as you can see 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:32.610
 taken out human by the way is here is 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.110
 greets 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.460
 efe 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:41.070
 you have the hangover and such 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.830
 Well, as you can see, I have chosen Paladin as 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.810
 main hero since I find it a 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.189
 unity 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.600
 as I have commented in others 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.590
 gameplay quote a bit from the other 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.930
 side of the barrier I playing with the 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.490
 pit with orcs and they with humans I 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.399
 he seems a very good hero supporting 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.100
 Allied units because as you have 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:05.429
 seen has heal has a shield that 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.640
 they are giving resistance and others and that 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.709
 with private soldiers is fine and such is not 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.290
 makes them last longer and diego and things for 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.480
 the style but with units already much more 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.060
 powerful as gentlemen makes them 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.319
 practically invulnerable they end up being 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.840
 units 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.540
 really scary and the strategy that 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.640
 they are using in this gameplay 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.069
 It basically consisted of starting with 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:33.840
 soldiers use a little base if 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:37.200
 you can and so on and finish a little 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.670
 pulling gentlemen mixing them with 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.540
 armor skills and so on 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.670
 paladin and at level 6 at least 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.830
 I awoke in reliving the not that that 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.350
 it looks like a burrar 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.540
 but good and here as you see trying 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.060
 prick the base a bit and other just that 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:58.140
 knock down a pitchfork at these levels is 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:02.370
 quite complicated since we go had 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:05.910
 some units plucks heads pretty 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:07.620
 good and also the killer whales and 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.600
 others that helped a lot to the defense and 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.540
 it's almost impossible to get in there and finish 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.820
 with that truth they do it very well take out 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.170
 only four or five trolls to the 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.840
 of our typical jaime based 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.000
 so that no 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.489
 do not suffer damage I imagine that what 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.019
 I would have the truth out there because I do not know 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.500
 I saw more than anything because of the issue of 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:29.660
 parchment and so on and well the truth is 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.510
 that in this job I play pretty badly 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.700
 with humans the truth is it will be for 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.299
 give you an idea the third 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.319
 playing game or so in a year since 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.000
 I had planned to upload another video with 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.340
 humans and such but split the archives 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.580
 they did not go well, not moved 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.830
 and nothing here I leave this example that 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:52.230
 comes to say basically the same thing 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.930
 in this phase of the game I was 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.770
 terribly poorly developed since 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:58.050
 I would have to have the second hero 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.670
 would have to go up the level of 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.300
 fact should have already knights 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.430
 but I do not know myself well in case 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.069
 the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.569
 a development of a good human base 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:11.790
 here those that I mentioned before 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.260
 scouts and I'm going and exploring my base with 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:14.670
 the wolf and seeing that he had no towers and 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.560
 other powers 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.120
 I imagine he said to make little birds 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.460
 here we eat this in a moment 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:24.440
 and that I do not know precisely the 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.350
 development of a human base indeed 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.590
 most things that I have and neither 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.479
 even the second hero was used what 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.250
 I already sack when I have the castle 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.090
 too late the game and then 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.400
 well, it has very little 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:43.350
 utility 

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:47.080
 so nothing I hope you liked 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.430
 the video and just think a little about the 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.320
 theme of 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.380
 to see what strategies can be 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.990
 use and others for example with him 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:59.140
 with the subject of humans to explore 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.630
 the base i what I recommend surely 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:04.930
 would be to go with some private or 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:06.400
 even some some peasant since they are 

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.170
 pretty cheap and good to see if 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.960
 they have all do not have towers or a little 

00:05:08.170 --> 00:05:14.110
 command your base is pretty good with 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.150
 the moat night more than anything the 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.280
 hawk hunters and such can 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:21.100
 come well but good guys too 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.860
 with orcs something could be done with macho 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.240
 this good man with those with the habits 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.490
 the shaman or something like that 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.490
 although if it is not almost finished 

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:36.150
 with the undead I have neither truth 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.510
 idea I imagine that with ghoul or something 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.110
 A) Yes 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:43.060
 and well here you see that I caught it there 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:47.260
 with all the cake I 'm about to attack 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.990
 base I think I had 6 waivers 7 starts 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:52.870
 head is such a thing and the hero I think 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.060
 that only had one and that here you see how 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:57.670
 I annihilated all the troops and I will go 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:06:01.330
 trying to dizzy with the paladin as 

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:03.670
 I can to defend the base and nothing here 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:05.820
 it ends with me definitely 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.990
 I hope you liked the video 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.660
 congratulations to the rival for playing 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:12.700
 also and nadal there are favorites and all the 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:15.690
 theme if you liked it and I leave you with the 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.690
 chau statistics 

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.860
 why 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.850
 and another series wonders why it has not 

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:28.220
 uploaded more metal gear videos is a 

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:31.480
 mix of doing nothing for three 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.480
 months and have a parents 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:35.260
 yes
