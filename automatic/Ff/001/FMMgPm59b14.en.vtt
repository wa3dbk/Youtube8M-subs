out<00:02:17.530> if<00:02:18.070> it<00:02:18.220> did<00:02:18.370> water<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.850> gave<00:02:19.000> you<00:02:19.150> an

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:19.240 
out if it did water it gave you an

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
so it didn't become a production you

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:43.740 
so it didn't become a production you
never<00:02:23.560> saw<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.800> dry<00:02:24.010> jheri<00:02:24.340> curl<00:02:24.430> did<00:02:24.790> you<00:02:42.750> and
