00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.580
 Hello, you are watching the channel was wine 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.500
 My name is Nikita and this is the fourth part 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.950
 understandable Russian guide to build input 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.480
 craft 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.759
 and today I will tell you about 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.730
 additional filler have here 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:18.180
 so take a placeholder a few more 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.910
 tools we need is a placeholder 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.529
 look like this is what a placeholder can do 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.689
 fill can work with highlighted 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.539
 territory territory we also highlight 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.849
 with the help of markers we put a marker and 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.140
 we allocate territories 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.570
 now we have to put next to one 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.120
 of the placeholder markers which we do 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.879
 and he removes the tags by this showing that he 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.040
 ready to work from a dedicated area 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.500
 how does he work here in this field we 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.850
 We spread him programs nightly especially 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.059
 programs to be called 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.320
 complete filling 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.719
 energy filler works 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.320
 engines i will put a fast engine 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.149
 To put a long time does not torment it 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.600
 move running on electricity and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.460
 we actually saw filling programs 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.229
 Now you need to give him the resources so that he 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.100
 could remember now completely 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.150
 fill in all this territory as you can see 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.460
 he began to build and 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.830
 pretty quickly he did it all for you 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.810
 it actually works like this 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.780
 placeholder and now i will show you all 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.600
 the rest of his program 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.060
 cleaning looks like this actually 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.890
 the name says it all 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.020
 feel all blocks fell out asia 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.659
 the next kind of placeholder program is 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.020
 in this way we lay out the box 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.210
 we start programs the box builds the 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.680
 the box fills everything except the inside 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.540
 cavity that is, fills one by one 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:45.479
 block page and then you can go there 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:47.220
 Here's a turned this program 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:53.210
 the next kind of pyramid program 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:53.210
 It turns out so run and see 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.360
 the next ladder program let's say we 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.820
 we want to get there actually how we 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.569
 you can do it for this 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.400
 lay out and actually run this 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.770
 program for the construction of stairs that is 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.129
 the program speaks for itself here 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.970
 such leaves lined up pretty 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:20.879
 next and last program view 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.819
 aggregate and goods and this kind of 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:26.010
 the program clears the level that is given 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.000
 and completely fills that level 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.830
 which is under 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.430
 then actually let's see how it is 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.110
 it turns out like this 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.290
 Well it turns out the same way here for sell 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.400
 resources and so kill the enemy 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.500
 actually it was the last program 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.569
 commandment as you could see in my 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.390
 video all the blocks that broke 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:47.760
 aggregate fell to the floor so it is good 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.980
 who plays survival use it for 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.420
 construction but if you play in 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.110
 creative you may not like it 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.940
 as the great destruction will be greatly 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.730
 affects the operation of your server or 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.739
 client what you need to do 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.580
 go to the main root folder 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.400
 minecraft 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.090
 open briefcase open debt craft 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.700
 open its main config and here in 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.409
 these two menus that is the falls to 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.720
 prevent films from droppin 'blogs 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.150
 and true filler brought destruction blogs 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.010
 instead of breaking 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:26.069
 you need to change the value that is where we 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:31.349
 true change to fall and here myths change 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:33.569
 Natra actually what it gives now he 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.670
 will destroy blocks nothing 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.580
 fall out and will not occur load 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.040
 to your server or client that's all 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:43.260
 I hope the guy was clear and useful to me 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.010
