down the middle of the building it's

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.420 
down the middle of the building it's
drawing<00:03:30.360> natural<00:03:30.870> daylight<00:03:31.319> in<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:32.100> the<00:03:32.220> belly

on the other side and then in the middle
you've<00:03:37.140> got<00:03:37.320> this<00:03:37.560> space<00:03:37.860> with<00:03:38.130> these<00:03:38.310> big

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
you've got this space with these big

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.870 
you've got this space with these big
wide<00:03:39.120> bridges<00:03:39.720> which<00:03:40.709> are<00:03:40.950> endeavoring<00:03:41.610> to

draw<00:03:42.420> the<00:03:42.480> students<00:03:43.470> together<00:03:43.860> so<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.820> have

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
draw the students together so you have

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:47.110 
draw the students together so you have
students<00:03:45.690> from<00:03:45.840> different<00:03:46.080> disciplines

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120

first time seeing each other work and

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.729 
first time seeing each other work and
creating<00:03:54.360> and<00:03:54.630> I<00:03:54.720> think<00:03:55.290> this<00:03:55.470> was<00:03:55.709> the
