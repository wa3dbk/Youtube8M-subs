forms<00:00:14.670> so<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:16.230> expected<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:16.859> fight<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.310> be<00:00:17.460> a

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
forms so I expected this fight to be a

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.920 
forms so I expected this fight to be a
little<00:00:17.880> bit<00:00:18.029> harder<00:00:18.359> than<00:00:18.539> what<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.900> actually

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
little bit harder than what it actually

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.370 
little bit harder than what it actually
was<00:00:19.760> as<00:00:20.760> long<00:00:20.939> as<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.180> have<00:00:21.359> decent<00:00:21.960> life<00:00:22.140> on

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
was as long as you have decent life on

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.009 
was as long as you have decent life on
hit<00:00:22.740> and<00:00:23.460> resistances<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.119> actually<00:00:24.840> isn't

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
hit and resistances and actually isn't

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.500 
hit and resistances and actually isn't
that<00:00:25.260> hard<00:00:25.500> I<00:00:26.130> kind<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.699> expected<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.359> be

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
that hard I kind of expected this to be

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.169 
that hard I kind of expected this to be
the<00:00:27.840> hardest<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.560> uber<00:00:28.980> bosses<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:30.000> it

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the hardest of the uber bosses and it

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.110 
the hardest of the uber bosses and it
turns<00:00:30.390> out<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.720> is<00:00:30.840> actually<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.349> easiest

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
turns out this is actually the easiest

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.049 
turns out this is actually the easiest
so<00:00:33.120> let's<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.260> goes<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.559> show<00:00:34.620> what<00:00:34.920> a

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
so let's just goes to show what a

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.979 
so let's just goes to show what a
expectations<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.149> all<00:00:36.270> about<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.630> anyway

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
expectations are all about but anyway

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.400 
expectations are all about but anyway
this<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.530> monster<00:00:37.980> power<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:39.410> monster

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
this is on monster power for monster

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.350 
this is on monster power for monster
power<00:00:40.559> form<00:00:40.829> is<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.190> I<00:00:41.219> farm<00:00:41.820> on<00:00:42.059> so<00:00:42.329> I

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
power form is what I farm on so I

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.330 
power form is what I farm on so I
figured<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.780> would<00:00:42.930> be<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:43.050> good<00:00:43.230> start<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.860> good

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
figured it would be a good start a good

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.580 
figured it would be a good start a good
step<00:00:44.579> start<00:00:44.940> on<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.329> was<00:00:45.899> going<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.079> try<00:00:46.200> monster

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
step start on I was going to try monster

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.459 
step start on I was going to try monster
power<00:00:46.770> 5<00:00:47.129> but<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.090> didn't<00:00:48.480> realize<00:00:48.899> just<00:00:49.320> how

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
power 5 but I didn't realize just how

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.549 
power 5 but I didn't realize just how
hard<00:00:50.010> some<00:00:50.640> of<00:00:50.789> these<00:00:50.940> bosses<00:00:51.510> actually<00:00:52.170> hit<00:00:52.379> I

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
hard some of these bosses actually hit I

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.340 
hard some of these bosses actually hit I
mean<00:00:53.430> when<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.329> go<00:00:54.449> against<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.899> skeleton

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
mean when you go against the skeleton

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.470 
mean when you go against the skeleton
king<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.770> Magda<00:00:56.190> I<00:00:56.370> mean<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:57.090> very

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
king and Magda I mean you can very

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.260 
king and Magda I mean you can very
easily<00:00:57.570> just<00:00:58.140> get<00:00:58.289> one<00:00:58.500> shotted<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.160> not<00:01:00.059> even

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
easily just get one shotted and not even

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.260 
easily just get one shotted and not even
recognize<00:01:00.420> what<00:01:00.899> happened<00:01:01.460> but<00:01:02.460> anyway<00:01:02.789> as

team and one of the most efficient
things<00:01:10.320> you<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.619> do<00:01:10.830> once<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.580> get<00:01:11.790> an

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
things you can do once you get an

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.450 
things you can do once you get an
infernal<00:01:12.360> machine<00:01:12.720> is<00:01:12.960> to<00:01:13.560> team<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:14.040> two

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
infernal machine is to team up with two

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.160 
infernal machine is to team up with two
other<00:01:14.640> people<00:01:15.060> who<00:01:15.090> have<00:01:15.509> an<00:01:15.720> infernal

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
other people who have an infernal

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.590 
other people who have an infernal
machine<00:01:16.549> then<00:01:17.549> you<00:01:17.640> can<00:01:17.759> open<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.090> all<00:01:18.330> three

machine then you can open up all three

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.289 
machine then you can open up all three
portals<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.830> only<00:01:20.009> need<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.220> get<00:01:20.490> you<00:01:21.180> know

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
portals you only need to get you know

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.359 
portals you only need to get you know
your<00:01:21.479> five<00:01:21.720> stacks<00:01:22.020> one<00:01:22.470> time<00:01:22.710> before<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.189> get

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
your five stacks one time before you get

to them and then you can fight all three
of<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.009> realms<00:01:26.909> same<00:01:27.299> time<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.159> it's<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.250> lot

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
of the realms same time and it's a lot

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:30.859 
of the realms same time and it's a lot
more<00:01:29.400> efficient<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.119> fast<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.720> don't

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
more efficient and fast and you don't

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.450 
more efficient and fast and you don't
have<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:31.079> waste<00:01:31.290> as<00:01:31.500> many<00:01:31.680> portals<00:01:32.070> because

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
have to waste as many portals because

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.370 
have to waste as many portals because
you're<00:01:32.640> all<00:01:32.820> you<00:01:33.600> know<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.750> together<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
you're all you know going together and

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.289 
you're all you know going together and
you<00:01:34.470> all<00:01:34.590> have<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.860> same<00:01:35.070> chance<00:01:35.520> of<00:01:35.820> getting

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
you all have the same chance of getting

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.660 
you all have the same chance of getting
the<00:01:36.420> drops<00:01:37.009> so<00:01:38.009> it's<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> lot<00:01:38.340> it's<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.640> lot

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the drops so it's a lot it's a lot

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.429 
the drops so it's a lot it's a lot
faster<00:01:39.000> way<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.659> can<00:01:39.840> team<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.140> with

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
faster way if you can team up with

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.679 
faster way if you can team up with
people<00:01:40.770> look<00:01:41.610> through<00:01:41.790> the<00:01:41.850> general<00:01:42.210> chat<00:01:42.509> to

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.760 
fighting on so with us fighting on Mazda
power<00:02:13.580> for<00:02:13.940> we<00:02:14.270> have<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.480> forty<00:02:15.080> percent<00:02:15.410> chance

of<00:02:16.450> getting<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:17.540> drop<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:19.010> goes<00:02:19.130> up<00:02:19.370> by

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:19.489 
of getting the drop and that goes up by

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.070 
of getting the drop and that goes up by
ten<00:02:19.700> percent<00:02:19.730> for<00:02:20.180> each<00:02:20.300> monster<00:02:20.480> power<00:02:20.870> so

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
ten percent for each monster power so

monster<00:02:26.690> power<00:02:26.840> 10<00:02:27.170> is<00:02:27.800> extremely<00:02:28.310> difficult

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
monster power 10 is extremely difficult

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.449 
monster power 10 is extremely difficult
because<00:02:29.209> it<00:02:29.680> dissipate<00:02:30.680> the<00:02:30.709> amount<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.160> time

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
because it dissipate the amount of time

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.570 
because it dissipate the amount of time
that<00:02:31.489> it<00:02:31.730> takes<00:02:32.000> to<00:02:32.209> kill<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:32.930> bosses<00:02:33.580> each

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
that it takes to kill the bosses each

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.810 
that it takes to kill the bosses each
boss<00:02:35.030> has<00:02:35.870> an<00:02:36.200> eight<00:02:36.590> minute<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.190> rage<00:02:37.459> timer

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
boss has an eight minute and rage timer

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.910 
boss has an eight minute and rage timer
okay<00:02:38.690> so<00:02:38.750> if<00:02:38.959> you<00:02:39.080> don't<00:02:39.260> kill<00:02:39.410> them<00:02:39.650> in<00:02:39.769> eight

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
okay so if you don't kill them in eight

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.550 
okay so if you don't kill them in eight
minutes<00:02:40.510> they<00:02:41.510> enrage<00:02:41.870> and<00:02:41.900> they<00:02:42.170> kill<00:02:42.410> you

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
minutes they enrage and they kill you

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.820 
minutes they enrage and they kill you
with<00:02:42.680> one<00:02:42.709> shot<00:02:43.150> now<00:02:44.150> there<00:02:44.330> is<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> way<00:02:44.810> to<00:02:44.870> to

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
with one shot now there is a way to to

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.070 
with one shot now there is a way to to
bypass<00:02:46.310> that<00:02:46.370> with<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.090> Magda<00:02:47.540> level<00:02:47.870> but<00:02:47.989> I'm

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
bypass that with the Magda level but I'm

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.840 
bypass that with the Magda level but I'm
not<00:02:48.260> entirely<00:02:48.530> sure<00:02:48.739> what<00:02:49.130> it<00:02:49.250> is<00:02:49.280> so<00:02:49.700> I'll

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
not entirely sure what it is so I'll

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:52.810 
not entirely sure what it is so I'll
cover<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.209> when<00:02:50.630> I<00:02:50.660> put<00:02:51.260> that<00:02:51.410> video<00:02:51.620> up<00:02:51.820> but

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
cover that when I put that video up but

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.300 
cover that when I put that video up but
basically<00:02:53.630> as<00:02:54.019> a<00:02:54.050> whirlwind<00:02:54.410> barb<00:02:54.830> for<00:02:55.160> this

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
basically as a whirlwind barb for this

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.570 
basically as a whirlwind barb for this
fight<00:02:55.610> it's<00:02:55.910> pretty<00:02:56.150> simple<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:57.260> like<00:02:58.250> to<00:02:58.370> focus

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
fight it's pretty simple I like to focus

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:00.550 
fight it's pretty simple I like to focus
on<00:02:58.910> gham<00:02:59.180> just<00:02:59.600> because<00:02:59.810> he<00:02:59.959> has<00:03:00.080> more<00:03:00.260> health

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
on gham just because he has more health

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.569 
on gham just because he has more health
and<00:03:01.360> if<00:03:02.360> you're<00:03:02.540> fighting<00:03:02.870> racking<00:03:03.230> off<00:03:03.579> with

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:04.579 
and if you're fighting racking off with

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.009 
and if you're fighting racking off with
the<00:03:04.730> poison<00:03:05.150> clouds<00:03:05.360> at<00:03:05.540> the<00:03:05.630> same<00:03:05.840> time

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
the poison clouds at the same time

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.569 
the poison clouds at the same time
sometimes<00:03:06.380> you<00:03:06.650> can<00:03:06.829> lose<00:03:06.980> a<00:03:07.040> lot<00:03:07.280> of<00:03:07.310> health

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
sometimes you can lose a lot of health

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:10.330 
sometimes you can lose a lot of health
quickly<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:08.239> we<00:03:08.269> focused<00:03:08.660> on<00:03:09.019> gum<00:03:09.320> got<00:03:10.100> his

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
quickly so we focused on gum got his

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:11.830 
quickly so we focused on gum got his
health<00:03:10.579> down<00:03:10.820> so<00:03:11.000> he's<00:03:11.090> got<00:03:11.209> the<00:03:11.329> most<00:03:11.510> health

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
health down so he's got the most health

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.990 
health down so he's got the most health
and<00:03:12.170> it<00:03:12.769> clears<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.190> field<00:03:13.340> of<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:13.640> poison

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
and it clears the field of the poison

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.280 
and it clears the field of the poison
clouds<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.390> once<00:03:14.510> the<00:03:14.600> poison<00:03:14.930> clouds<00:03:15.140> are

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
clouds and once the poison clouds are

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.410 
clouds and once the poison clouds are
gone<00:03:15.440> Rach<00:03:16.280> naath<00:03:16.519> is<00:03:16.760> actually<00:03:17.120> pretty<00:03:17.329> easy

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
gone Rach naath is actually pretty easy

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.250 
gone Rach naath is actually pretty easy
to<00:03:17.750> kill<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.680> go<00:03:19.400> for<00:03:19.610> gum<00:03:19.790> first<00:03:20.209> have<00:03:21.110> at
