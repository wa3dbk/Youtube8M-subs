00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
get that history that we really take for

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.219 
get that history that we really take for
granted<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:29.970> sometimes<00:01:30.299> hard<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.570> do<00:01:30.780> I<00:01:31.020> just

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
granted just sometimes hard to do I just

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.039 
granted just sometimes hard to do I just
realized<00:01:31.560> this<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:32.250> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.430> greenness<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:32.939> a

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
realized this one of the greenness is a

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.810 
realized this one of the greenness is a
dried<00:01:34.049> scallops

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
dried scallops

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.120 
dried scallops
and<00:01:35.970> that's<00:01:36.150> dry<00:01:36.390> scallop<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.770> found<00:01:37.950> out

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
and that's dry scallop I just found out

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.069 
and that's dry scallop I just found out
well<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:38.729> is<00:01:39.000> seventy-eight<00:01:39.720> dollars<00:01:39.750> a

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
well this is seventy-eight dollars a

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.270
