00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:15.820 
program law and technology is that we

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.230 
program law and technology is that we

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:43.750 
and an ICT point of view and most of the

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.570 
and an ICT point of view and most of the
programs<00:00:44.229> that<00:00:44.320> I<00:00:44.500> found<00:00:44.739> in<00:00:44.890> other<00:00:45.040> countries

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
programs that I found in other countries

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.910 
programs that I found in other countries
they<00:00:45.850> were<00:00:45.909> either<00:00:46.360> one<00:00:46.629> or<00:00:46.659> the<00:00:46.870> other<00:00:46.989> so

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
they were either one or the other so

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.460 
they were either one or the other so
this<00:00:48.129> was<00:00:48.430> a<00:00:48.760> combined<00:00:49.210> program<00:00:50.110> which<00:00:50.260> was

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
this was a combined program which was

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.750 
this was a combined program which was
perfect

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
perfect

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.090

what<00:00:53.329> I<00:00:53.360> like<00:00:53.540> most<00:00:53.690> about<00:00:53.870> this<00:00:54.140> of<00:00:54.920> the

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
what I like most about this of the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.310 
what I like most about this of the
Masters<00:00:55.460> warm<00:00:55.610> technology<00:00:56.149> is<00:00:56.660> that<00:00:56.840> it's<00:00:57.020> not

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
Masters warm technology is that it's not

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.350 
Masters warm technology is that it's not
just<00:00:57.350> on<00:00:58.100> one<00:00:58.370> part<00:00:58.670> of<00:00:58.790> technology<00:00:59.210> it's<00:00:59.329> not

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
just on one part of technology it's not

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.940 
just on one part of technology it's not
just<00:00:59.720> about<00:00:59.809> patent<00:01:00.350> law<00:01:00.410> it's<00:01:00.620> not<00:01:00.649> just

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:00.950 
just about patent law it's not just

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.710 
just about patent law it's not just
about<00:01:01.040> fire<00:01:01.340> fire<00:01:01.700> technology<00:01:02.000> it's<00:01:02.629> about

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
about fire fire technology it's about

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.560 
about fire fire technology it's about
all<00:01:03.079> those<00:01:03.260> areas<00:01:03.559> that<00:01:03.739> are<00:01:03.920> new<00:01:04.159> to<00:01:04.390> to<00:01:05.390> law

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
all those areas that are new to to law

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.600 
all those areas that are new to to law
and<00:01:05.900> that's<00:01:06.650> what<00:01:06.770> I<00:01:06.800> really<00:01:06.920> enjoy<00:01:07.280> about<00:01:07.310> his

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:07.610 
and that's what I really enjoy about his

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.830 
and that's what I really enjoy about his
program

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.830 

we<00:01:11.380> do<00:01:11.680> educate<00:01:12.490> people<00:01:12.790> from<00:01:13.240> a<00:01:13.420> lot<00:01:13.720> of

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
we do educate people from a lot of

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.260 
we do educate people from a lot of
perspective<00:01:14.500> but<00:01:15.070> we<00:01:15.220> also<00:01:15.340> try<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:15.820> teach

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
perspective but we also try to teach

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.539 
perspective but we also try to teach
them<00:01:16.540> that<00:01:16.840> laws<00:01:17.079> in<00:01:17.380> context<00:01:17.950> law<00:01:18.369> as<00:01:18.520> a

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
them that laws in context law as a

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.850 
them that laws in context law as a
society<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.479> law<00:01:19.840> as<00:01:19.990> influenced<00:01:20.560> by<00:01:20.680> other

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
society a law as influenced by other

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.600 
society a law as influenced by other
disciplines

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.640 

I<00:01:23.670> like<00:01:24.360> most<00:01:24.600> about<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:25.020> program<00:01:25.200> is<00:01:25.620> that

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
I like most about the program is that

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.800 
I like most about the program is that
you're<00:01:26.190> given<00:01:26.550> a<00:01:26.640> practical<00:01:27.240> insight<00:01:27.600> into

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
you're given a practical insight into

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.320 
you're given a practical insight into
things<00:01:28.080> it's<00:01:28.890> something<00:01:29.760> which<00:01:29.910> is<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
things it's something which is the

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:33.260 
things it's something which is the
industry<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.020> fast-paced<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:32.310> just

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
industry is so fast-paced that just

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450 
industry is so fast-paced that just
learning<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.720> information<00:01:33.840> as<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.620> is<00:01:34.770> now<00:01:35.040> it

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
learning the information as it is now it

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.880 
learning the information as it is now it
would<00:01:35.850> probably<00:01:36.090> be<00:01:36.510> useless<00:01:36.720> in<00:01:37.170> five<00:01:37.620> years

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
would probably be useless in five years

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.910 
would probably be useless in five years
time<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:38.820> actually<00:01:39.480> learning<00:01:39.690> the<00:01:39.960> tools<00:01:40.380> to

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
time so actually learning the tools to

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.760 
time so actually learning the tools to
use<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.210> industry<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:42.960> practice<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.710> think

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
use in the industry in practice I think

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.459 
use in the industry in practice I think
that's<00:01:44.070> really<00:01:44.370> important

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:46.469 
that's really important

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:48.739 
that's really important
I'd<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.219> be<00:01:47.340> working<00:01:47.640> at<00:01:47.729> a<00:01:47.789> law<00:01:47.939> firm<00:01:47.969> but

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:48.749 
I'd like to be working at a law firm but

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:50.630 
I'd like to be working at a law firm but
of<00:01:48.990> course<00:01:49.319> because<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.039> master's<00:01:50.609> program

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
of course because this master's program

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.740 
of course because this master's program
with<00:01:50.939> such<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> wide<00:01:51.630> variety<00:01:51.840> of<00:01:52.200> subjects<00:01:52.710> and
