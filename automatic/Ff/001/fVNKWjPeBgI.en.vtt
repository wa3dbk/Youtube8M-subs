00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.280
 very good two guys welcome are 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.110
 videos we are in the stock cultures that 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.570
 we are in octane because good every time 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.939
 I like more fenced crops and we're 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.990
 in a new one that with rifle 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:29.039
 sniper then nothing because 28 m and yes 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.539
 I do not want to go wrong in 28 why not 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.550
 I'm going to take you out of the golden area of ​​the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.500
 subsample taken out and we're almost done 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.850
 the sniper rifles and so what 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.129
 we are leaving and lately I am 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.360
 playing quite more alcohol obviously 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.550
 when I go in a group when you do not go 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.949
 group is an ordeal when you play one 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.330
 then you go to league mode or some game 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.970
 public from white two but if you do not 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.110
 will take the crops not the truth that 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.080
 lately it's not working enough 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.260
 I like it because it does not look like the 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.129
 more real things the truth and to the 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.019
 the beginning of the game cost me 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.360
 get used to sure that we go other os 

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:02.369
 they are accustomed and you still do not know 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.320
 how agost but I think that man 

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:05.930
 that it's worth it to know what 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.130
 same and in the end it is a fucking pain in the ass 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.740
 good kids tell me I'm 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.200
 starting another day in the missions of 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.509
 how to improve in the call of duty and many 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.380
 you told me to teach how to put 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.930
 the fingers 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.520
 to jump as if it were a shield there 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.110
 a way to do it but I do not use it 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.439
 I just give the quick X 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.789
 when I want zero james and I do not have is that 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.170
 or anything like that that is a matter of 

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:29.700
 practice and good sometimes you can be 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.400
 it can be worse for you but everything is 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.220
 possible to practice 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.560
 also good also means that 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.780
 I have a tutorial of my uploaded or 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.400
 be that if you can find it then it is 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.470
 in my channel maybe portability 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:45.200
 to be like them and all that because 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.750
 If you're interested, it's pretty 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.900
 entertaining also tell you that I was 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.940
 seeing more and that more emissions could 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.800
 climb but well I know it has not gone up 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.960
 still as better in the call of duty in 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.460
 the one that was going to rise yesterday but is that the 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.600
 another day I noticed and how good I do not have 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.250
 nothing of not looking 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.080
 it's been a long time since it's a game with 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.880
 sniper and good though the truth 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.680
 which I maintain for a large part 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.780
 of the game because I was 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.400
 simply heating up after a day 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.600
 without playing I turned on the wanted it 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.510
 I got with the sniper and that's why 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.200
 I have been some shots 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.459
 but the truth is that for a little while and with 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.860
 what he had learned the other day 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.920
 I was pretty good that you already know that 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.959
 I like alternating so sniper 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.849
 public league for times more than one 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:30.439
 thing comes out more than another and this week 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.409
 I'm not playing much either because I have 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:35.329
 much mess but much mess and 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.590
 sometimes you can not sometimes you do not know part 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:39.739
 so pull the locks you have 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.030
 having saved because if not then not 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:42.290
 you arrive for that reason on Sunday not 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.260
 you can upload videos guys because I had 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.060
 an incredible mess and clear then in the end 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.819
 was talking was accumulating and 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.140
 as it is not like 9 you end up not 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:54.140
 you finish 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.610
 we say that time is the mecca of 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.590
 America seems to me better fusion of 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.390
 sniper cost kills a lot 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.709
 obviously in extreme one-rod kill 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.400
 as in these seven rifles 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.160
 sniper 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.560
 but the sniper rifles in the 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.740
 head they also kill in basic of a 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.390
 bullet and for me the Mecca is the best 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:15.410
 proportion have relation has between 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.200
 Cadence of damage and mobility to part of 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.820
 precision because the 28 are enough is going 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.890
 pretty every time you shoot for me 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.450
 opinion and although it has better cadence 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.150
 that the mecca but the truth that the mecca 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:28.040
 it's like the mecca of the white managers of 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.019
 zombies I do not know if it's true is the mecca of 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.269
 the things of phoenix is ​​obviously like 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.530
 the same mecca but for public and the 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:36.080
 it 's really fine I like it 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.630
 a lot and I wear it obviously I prefer 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:40.550
 an automatic weapon when I play as 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.800
 honey bayern or the remington but when 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.330
 go and get me that kind of camps 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.730
 I have a hard time doc I do not have a bad time 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:49.159
 I had a really bad time with him 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.540
 with psuv and all those things but 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:53.599
 good 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.920
 I think I do not know how little it was a bit 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.569
 it's because in reality rifles 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.510
 submachine guns finished rifles 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.230
 sniper every one who gets 28 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:05.989
 and then it would be light, there are two that 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.640
 I think they are the l sad and the tension and 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.109
 Then there are the folders and rifles 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.210
 precision thus end up being weekly 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:15.310
 we finished sniper rifles 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:16.630
 the light ones to put them with what 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.580
 interesting and what we are going to give of 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.520
 true that they are complete bases and that they are 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.170
 the precision rifles the shotguns 

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:27.010
 I will contribute what is mine, surely 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:28.810
 you are in extreme and on maps that 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.490
 they are short that can be heard well 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.480
 and you can see more or less because we're 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.580
 on the level because if it's not going to be 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.230
 quite complicated but with the tag 12 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:36.760
 I do not think it costs a lot and with the extra 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.800
 and with the stryker not because 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.500
 burst milk that happens 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.180
 with the commanders of this game with the 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.760
 commanded that you get you never know 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.980
 then at the low the base in streak of 20 

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.150
 and it is cuchi the unit 3 meters clear 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.830
 which is one of the things that I 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.690
 annoying of the game and that if they changed 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.490
 I would be super happy because they were 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.130
 with him they have not cut me game with the 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:58.960
 piquetero comanda program area 

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.910
 obviously I already told you that this week 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.449
 I was also going to upload two because I already know that 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:05.129
 actually many 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.599
 channels or most of the chains already 

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:08.639
 they do not come up with me I do not understand why it will be 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:10.680
 because there are people who are good friends 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:12.930
 two and people who will not see us the taste 

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.089
 who does not like directly friend 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.580
 I work well in both of them and I like them 

00:05:15.089 --> 00:05:20.339
 both of them and that's why fuck I think it's 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.960
 quite interesting it's vital but 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.879
 more president every time also be 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.610
 brutal to see if when we have 

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:28.529
 more reliable information or more 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:30.389
 informations I can say something about the 

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:31.680
 theme so that you are aware does nothing 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:34.139
 guys, I hope you liked the one 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.699
 the ibex we see in the video tomorrow that 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:38.129
 it is obviously that it will be of the thing 

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:40.969
 surely it will be a league like that 

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.969
 that nothing guys see you later
