00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:23.900
 more than 10 andy I told him and he told me eugenio 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.230

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.160
 and turns and then yes I realized 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.090
 that in the art world, people 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.090

 that one was made in the ear but good 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.250
 as always I remember that I had a 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.470
 girlfriend does a lot 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:06.180
 what he liked and to write and the truth 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.410
 is that he noticed me because I really 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:12.100
 limited very well I did not move very well 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:16.380

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.330

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.850
 once beaten at night with a great 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.950
 pizza in your face 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.750
 until he realized then I already 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.480
 he left this year you have had a lot of presence 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.370
 in the media because of the wanted this is 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.400
 to the great controversy that the day you are with 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.810
 your hitler in pretty face do not ask me 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.050
 one inhabitants also added that you already know 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.620

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:49.140
 you look for many pictures of kittens in the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.770
 Facebook 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:54.750
 it's a contemporary art magazine it 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.120
 fixed on the qualities 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.480
 of an artist and in his work to me 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.480
 It seems 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:05.440
 I , Lady Gaga, have no fucking idea 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:08.170
 truth and that is all when when 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.060
 let's go to some inauguration when we go 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:14.020
 to some museum when we go to some what 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:15.940
 what differentiates an artist from a 

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.590
 let's look at an artist not 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.540
 professional 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.310
 sometimes breakfast a little at times from 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.290
 followed a lot depending on what I go 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.960
 to make or soldan calm walk by the 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.150
 park the house my parents not home 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:33.600

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.600
 of fucking mother and the chickpeas 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.560
 the great public has known you for your 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.910
 Fat boy installation with asthma that eats 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:50.110
 his taste and he cries in the dark 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.200
 you're afraid to end up as belle esteban or 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.580
 as george lucas 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.970
 you have to keep in mind that to have 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:00.620
 a fair this is the power is very 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.750
 important to have 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:06.310
 that develops in the brother dif 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.310
 they are an institution an institution 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.220
 already does 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:19.609
 I read somewhere that in the 90's 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:23.310

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.949
 that religion can also be 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.949
 that you can not 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.580
 and even 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.180
 from your step through avoid 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:41.100

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.490
 eugenio 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.130
 to be an artist 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.809
 they develop a little 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.930
 when you sell a franc the frame what 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.930
 you sell apart 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:16.120
