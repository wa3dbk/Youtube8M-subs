so also in that pack 3 is a new nazi
zombie<00:00:12.900> level<00:00:13.139> dare<00:00:13.380> reese<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.980> takes<00:00:14.219> place

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
zombie level dare reese it takes place

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.120 
zombie level dare reese it takes place
in<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:15.120> we<00:00:15.540> call<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.719> zombie<00:00:16.320> factory<00:00:16.890> in

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
in this and we call it zombie factory in

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.410 
in this and we call it zombie factory in
the<00:00:17.220> studio<00:00:17.490> because<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.940> taking<00:00:18.300> place

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
the studio because it is taking place

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.970 
the studio because it is taking place
and<00:00:18.660> sort<00:00:18.840> of<00:00:18.900> this<00:00:19.020> factory<00:00:19.410> like<00:00:19.560> facility

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
and sort of this factory like facility

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.160 
and sort of this factory like facility
it's<00:00:20.550> very<00:00:20.640> industrial<00:00:21.240> there's<00:00:21.779> a<00:00:21.840> few<00:00:22.050> new

are<00:00:37.530> teleport<00:00:38.250> machines<00:00:38.750> we<00:00:39.750> don't<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:40.020> toss

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
are teleport machines we don't just toss

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.389 
are teleport machines we don't just toss
it<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.680> you<00:00:40.739> can<00:00:40.860> just<00:00:40.980> run<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.250> in

objectives to it you're going to have to
link<00:00:44.430> up<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> teleporters<00:00:45.180> before<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.480> can

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
link up the teleporters before you can

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.389 
link up the teleporters before you can
actually<00:00:45.719> take<00:00:45.930> advantage<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.620> it's

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
actually take advantage of that it's

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.440 
actually take advantage of that it's
going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.579> cost<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.850> fifteen<00:00:48.120> hundred<00:00:48.360> points

each<00:00:48.660> time<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.930> light<00:00:49.020> a<00:00:49.050> teleport<00:00:49.500> but<00:00:49.620> it's

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
each time to light a teleport but it's

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.799 
each time to light a teleport but it's
great<00:00:50.010> it's<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.280> great<00:00:50.309> clutch<00:00:50.789> mechanism<00:00:51.270> if

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
great it's a great clutch mechanism if

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.119 
great it's a great clutch mechanism if
you're<00:00:51.930> ever<00:00:52.020> if<00:00:52.289> you're<00:00:52.410> ever<00:00:52.500> in<00:00:52.649> a<00:00:52.710> pine<00:00:52.920> and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
you're ever if you're ever in a pine and

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.260 
you're ever if you're ever in a pine and
you're<00:00:53.280> completely<00:00:53.489> swarm<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.180> were

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
you're completely swarm and we were

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
you're completely swarm and we were
playing<00:00:54.480> earlier<00:00:54.590> you're<00:00:55.590> completely

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
playing earlier you're completely

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.650 
playing earlier you're completely
getting<00:00:56.309> overrun<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.000> basically<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.600> just

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
getting overrun and basically you just

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.000 
getting overrun and basically you just
say<00:00:57.899> Matt<00:00:58.109> day<00:00:58.289> you<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.469> teleport<00:00:58.920> teleport

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
say Matt day you know teleport teleport

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.010 
say Matt day you know teleport teleport
get<00:00:59.399> out<00:00:59.489> of<00:00:59.609> there<00:00:59.730> also<00:01:00.210> any<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.570> our<00:01:00.690> weapons

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
get out of there also any of our weapons

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.139 
get out of there also any of our weapons
i<00:01:01.140> think<00:01:01.320> it's<00:01:01.440> 16<00:01:01.949> upgradeable<00:01:02.670> weapons<00:01:02.969> now

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
i think it's 16 upgradeable weapons now

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.820 
i think it's 16 upgradeable weapons now
you're<00:01:03.989> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.229> able<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.409> upgrade<00:01:04.500> with

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
you're going to be able to upgrade with

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.770 
you're going to be able to upgrade with
what's<00:01:05.010> called<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.309> pack<00:01:05.519> of<00:01:05.670> much<00:01:05.790> machine<00:01:06.180> so

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
what's called a pack of much machine so

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.390 
what's called a pack of much machine so
you<00:01:07.080> spend<00:01:07.470> your<00:01:07.619> money<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.950> put<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.310> the

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
you spend your money you put it in the

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.830 
you spend your money you put it in the
machine<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.790> comes<00:01:08.970> back<00:01:09.180> out<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.540> all<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.780> a

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
machine it comes back out and all of a

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.630 
machine it comes back out and all of a
sudden<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.380> fire<00:01:10.590> much<00:01:11.400> more

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
sudden is going to fire much more

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.310 
sudden is going to fire much more
explosive<00:01:12.090> rounds<00:01:12.600> much<00:01:12.750> for<00:01:12.900> damaging

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
explosive rounds much for damaging

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.200 
explosive rounds much for damaging
rounds<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.979> might<00:01:14.189> behave<00:01:14.490> differently<00:01:15.000> if

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
rounds it might behave differently if

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.760 
rounds it might behave differently if
you<00:01:15.299> put<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.570> VAR<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.290> it<00:01:16.380> comes<00:01:16.530> out

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
you put the VAR and then it comes out

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.460 
you put the VAR and then it comes out
you<00:01:17.460> actually<00:01:17.640> could<00:01:17.909> faster<00:01:18.570> with<00:01:18.720> it<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.259> now

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
you actually could faster with it so now

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.410 
you actually could faster with it so now
rather<00:01:20.159> than<00:01:20.280> rather<00:01:20.700> than<00:01:20.909> opening<00:01:21.119> up<00:01:21.330> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
rather than rather than opening up the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.359 
rather than rather than opening up the
mystery<00:01:21.689> box<00:01:21.869> you<00:01:22.200> get<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> car<00:01:22.560> 98<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.100> you<00:01:23.189> go

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
mystery box you get a car 98 and you go

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.830 
mystery box you get a car 98 and you go
what<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.850> hell<00:01:23.970> is<00:01:24.150> this<00:01:24.299> I<00:01:24.479> don't<00:01:24.509> want<00:01:24.720> to<00:01:24.780> I

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
what the hell is this I don't want to I

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.539 
what the hell is this I don't want to I
don't<00:01:24.869> wanna<00:01:25.110> bolt<00:01:25.320> action<00:01:25.650> rifle<00:01:26.009> well<00:01:26.430> now

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
don't wanna bolt action rifle well now

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.070 
don't wanna bolt action rifle well now
you<00:01:26.610> have<00:01:26.729> action<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.240> want<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:27.450> take<00:01:27.600> that<00:01:27.780> go
