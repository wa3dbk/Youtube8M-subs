00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 Good morning, concurrent, my name is 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.210
 teacher cesar i 'm a teacher 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.560
 math and military police 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.019
 I would like to tell you that I 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.910
 I find it much easier to be a police officer and a 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.590
 profession of honor and you who have the 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.750
 dream of becoming a police officer has to 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.090
 studying has no other way to battle 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.310
 It's difficult to study, people train. 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.900
 heavy in combat is easy let's go one 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.060
 subject much charged in any 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.269
 not only the military police 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.150
 state of the holy spirit not only of the 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.740
 national level is simple interest 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.500
 the simple game is a formula 1 is very 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.530
 easy to understand not in which people 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:42.239
 calls j that is equal if on series a 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:45.360
 where j is the seel interest is the capital and is the 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.070
 rate and t is the time in this formula password 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.180
 we just understand that the most 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.280
 important is we work i and t 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.280
 in the case the rate and the time in the same 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.940
 unit if for example the rate was 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 given the day time has to be 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.200
 also given in daytime because if the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.869
 for example 0.2 percent per day 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.920
 and the time is a month the calculation is not 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.119
 it will work 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.280
 ok so let's go here and show it in practice 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.900
 how this exercise because this 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.729
 matter is a matter that we do not 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.950
 We can take a lot of time in theory because 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.259
 deals with a summary line formula 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.150
 easy practice as well as all our 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.570
 a preparatory classes jc 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.790
 let's start the first exercise 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.210
 remembering that the formula zj is equal 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.829
 city â€‹â€‹on without calculation interest yielded 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.020
 for 1,500 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:45.200
 so let's describe the formula always 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.299
 We are going to write the way 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.939
 vertical for us to take each unit 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.270
 we need to be if j interest 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:59.759
 capital and the rate and your time 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:01.950
 in the case of interest j is to calculate the interest is the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.710
 that I want to find, I'll put 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:08.459
 question I do not have so will 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:12.360
 even only from a capital of 1,500 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:17.489
 I'm going to have 1500 of capital 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:21.959
 for four years the time four years 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:26.190
 because the blue of years and a rate of 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:29.470
 8% per annum rate 8 is always given 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.640
 percentage per year 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.959
 the first observation the rate that time 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.810
 is in the same unit 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.239
 Yes, four and eight are in the same unit 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.319
 a very important consideration for the 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.239
 china in attention wii and t will of them 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.410
 They will determine here I usually call 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:52.510
 my lessons from you and sittwe times have you 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.269
 it means total percentage of 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.069
 income since the two rates 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:59.290
 the two units are in the same unit 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:59.980
 measurement if you multiply one by 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.680
 other 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.510
 you will know the total percentage of 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.110
 income from its capital 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:11.500
 want to see eight times four as much as 32 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:15.720
 it is clear if eight times four of the 32 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:18.609
 soon all this capital of 1500 ac yielded 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.370
 32% this tip is very important for 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.200
 we resolve interest issues more 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:27.160
 we will continue in accordance with our 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:37.109
 so far interest will equal the formula 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:39.880
 1,500 times the rate is eight times ot 

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:43.120
 over 100 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.989
 It's interesting how you saw the classes. 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.510
 previous 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.090
 we have here a multiplication in the 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.500
 form of infringement every time in this case of 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.030
 interest formula will always give a 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.900
 explanation that the formula is a 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.549
 explanation 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.919
 every time I have the multiplication in the 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:58.599
 form of infraction I can stay the 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.169
 number up or down does not matter 

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.690
 order 

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:04.239
 Look how nice I can get these 20 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.599
 looting in getting these two eps cut 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:11.349
 cut the short port the answer will be 

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:13.239
 15 times eight times 4 soon 15 times eight 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:23.760
 times four looks how much we will calculate 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:26.680
 15 times 8 15 18 18 times 5 will give 40 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:31.030
 48 times one will be the 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:34.360
 with 4 12 then 15 times eight of the 120 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:40.740
 now we will triple 120 by 44 times 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:44.979
 120 very easy 4004 times 28 and 43 14 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:47.139
 so he gave 480 as an answer soon the interest 

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:50.139
 of this problem is mine of 1,500 reais 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:55.590
 applied for four years 800 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:59.050
 year will be equal to 480 reais 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:02.050
 the problem is solved 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.150
 the other questions you will see 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.669
 many times you will not have the 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.770
 capital or hilton, noting that 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:10.330
 treat yourself so you only play in the formula 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:11.530
 that you can solve 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.570
 Thank you so much, I hope you have helped. 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.099
 everyone there to practice interest because it is a 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.099
 important matter for public tender
