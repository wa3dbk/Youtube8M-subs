00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:37.290 

and<00:01:34.450> cut<00:01:34.930> those<00:01:35.260> in<00:01:35.500> half<00:01:35.530> again<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:37.090> that

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300 
and cut those in half again so that

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.720 
and cut those in half again so that
makes<00:01:37.480> the<00:01:37.690> smallest<00:01:37.870> strip<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:39.370> you'll<00:01:39.520> just

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 
makes the smallest strip so you'll just

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.390 
makes the smallest strip so you'll just
use<00:01:39.940> your<00:01:40.150> water<00:01:40.360> pen<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:41.050> you'll<00:01:41.920> alternate

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
use your water pen and you'll alternate

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.090 
use your water pen and you'll alternate
them<00:01:42.640> here<00:01:43.030> varying<00:01:43.960> colors<00:01:44.380> as<00:01:44.590> well<00:01:44.620> for

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
them here varying colors as well for

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.710 
them here varying colors as well for
demonstration<00:01:45.670> purposes<00:01:46.090> we<00:01:46.240> have<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.510> same

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
demonstration purposes we have the same

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.750 
demonstration purposes we have the same
color<00:01:47.020> so<00:01:47.740> that<00:01:47.770> allows<00:01:48.070> it<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.310> stick<00:01:48.610> to<00:01:48.730> the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
color so that allows it to stick to the

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.820 
color so that allows it to stick to the
fondant<00:01:49.300> here<00:01:49.780> we've<00:01:50.020> just<00:01:50.290> showed<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:50.680> the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
fondant here we've just showed you the

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.630 
fondant here we've just showed you the
different<00:01:51.190> sizes<00:01:52.530> compared<00:01:53.530> to<00:01:53.800> the<00:01:54.310> square

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
different sizes compared to the square

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.270 
different sizes compared to the square
sizes<00:01:55.330> so<00:01:56.050> there's<00:01:56.260> the<00:01:56.410> half<00:01:56.590> of<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:56.920> square

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
sizes so there's the half of the square

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.010 
sizes so there's the half of the square
and<00:01:57.460> then<00:01:57.520> half<00:01:57.729> again<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:58.390> you<00:01:58.450> can<00:01:58.630> see<00:01:58.840> how

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
and then half again so you can see how

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.930 
and then half again so you can see how
the<00:01:59.530> size<00:01:59.770> is<00:02:00.040> differ<00:02:00.280> and<00:02:00.580> then<00:02:00.670> you<00:02:00.790> can

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
the size is differ and then you can

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.170 
the size is differ and then you can
create<00:02:01.180> your<00:02:01.479> pattern<00:02:01.870> anyway<00:02:02.380> you<00:02:02.440> want<00:02:03.180> to

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
create your pattern anyway you want to

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.210 
create your pattern anyway you want to

smaller flowers on the next layer up and

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.500 
smaller flowers on the next layer up and
then<00:03:13.299> the<00:03:13.420> top<00:03:13.630> layer<00:03:13.900> here<00:03:14.350> is<00:03:14.620> just<00:03:14.980> our

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
then the top layer here is just our

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.000 
then the top layer here is just our
ruffled<00:03:16.510> texture<00:03:17.049> and<00:03:17.320> we'll<00:03:17.530> show<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:17.769> how

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
ruffled texture and we'll show you how

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.640 
ruffled texture and we'll show you how
to<00:03:18.070> do<00:03:18.250> that<00:03:18.280> next<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.780> what<00:03:19.959> we've<00:03:20.110> done<00:03:20.140> is

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
to do that next so what we've done is

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.280 
to do that next so what we've done is
cut<00:03:20.980> out<00:03:21.010> rectangles<00:03:21.940> of<00:03:22.090> fondant<00:03:22.690> we've

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
cut out rectangles of fondant we've

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.620 
cut out rectangles of fondant we've
already<00:03:23.530> attached<00:03:23.950> one<00:03:24.250> here<00:03:24.670> so<00:03:25.120> that<00:03:25.450> was

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
already attached one here so that was

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:29.070 
already attached one here so that was
just<00:03:25.989> simply<00:03:26.680> a<00:03:26.769> rectangle<00:03:27.489> here<00:03:27.820> we<00:03:28.510> fold<00:03:28.900> it

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:29.080 
just simply a rectangle here we fold it

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
just simply a rectangle here we fold it
over<00:03:29.230> in<00:03:29.680> half<00:03:30.280> and<00:03:30.760> then<00:03:31.450> just<00:03:32.200> kind<00:03:32.410> of<00:03:32.530> pinch

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
over in half and then just kind of pinch

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.290 
over in half and then just kind of pinch
these<00:03:33.340> edges<00:03:33.790> together

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
these edges together

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.890 
these edges together
and<00:03:35.680> leave<00:03:36.680> this<00:03:36.950> rounded<00:03:37.640> and<00:03:37.880> then<00:03:38.480> you'll

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
and leave this rounded and then you'll

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.020 
and leave this rounded and then you'll
just<00:03:39.200> line<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:39.680> up<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.520> height<00:03:40.760> of<00:03:40.790> your

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
just line it up to the height of your

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.380 
just line it up to the height of your
cake<00:03:41.480> and<00:03:41.860> trim<00:03:42.860> off<00:03:43.040> the<00:03:43.400> top<00:03:43.700> so<00:03:44.150> that<00:03:44.180> you

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
cake and trim off the top so that you

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.360 
cake and trim off the top so that you
get<00:03:44.540> it<00:03:44.690> to<00:03:44.840> the<00:03:44.960> height<00:03:45.170> that<00:03:45.380> you<00:03:45.440> would<00:03:45.710> like

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
get it to the height that you would like

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.500 
get it to the height that you would like
and<00:03:46.670> then<00:03:47.330> you'll<00:03:47.810> take<00:03:48.140> the<00:03:48.530> water<00:03:48.740> pen<00:03:49.040> and

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
and then you'll take the water pen and

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.450 
and then you'll take the water pen and
you<00:03:50.510> will<00:03:50.660> attach<00:03:51.200> to<00:03:51.410> this<00:03:51.590> side<00:03:51.920> and<00:03:52.250> then

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
you will attach to this side and then

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.060 
you will attach to this side and then
the<00:03:52.790> rounded<00:03:53.360> side<00:03:53.600> stays<00:03:54.020> up<00:03:54.320> and<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:55.040> just

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
the rounded side stays up and you just

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.580 
the rounded side stays up and you just
overlap<00:03:55.910> and<00:03:56.180> then<00:03:56.600> you<00:03:56.720> will<00:03:56.810> just<00:03:56.870> continue

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
overlap and then you will just continue

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:00.250 
overlap and then you will just continue
all<00:03:58.460> the<00:03:58.520> way<00:03:58.850> around<00:03:59.060> your<00:03:59.390> cake<00:03:59.630> taking

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
all the way around your cake taking

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.900 
all the way around your cake taking
those<00:04:00.410> rectangles<00:04:00.680> folding<00:04:01.490> them<00:04:01.610> in<00:04:01.700> half

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
those rectangles folding them in half

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:05.650 
those rectangles folding them in half
