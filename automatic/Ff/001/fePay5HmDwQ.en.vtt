this<00:04:27.450> is<00:04:27.510> before<00:04:27.690> i<00:04:27.930> prestiged<00:04:28.380> i'm<00:04:28.800> using<00:04:29.190> the

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
this is before i prestiged i'm using the

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.070 
this is before i prestiged i'm using the
UAV<00:04:30.440> harrier<00:04:31.440> and<00:04:31.820> emergency<00:04:32.820> airdrop<00:04:33.180> which

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
UAV harrier and emergency airdrop which

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.530 
UAV harrier and emergency airdrop which
is<00:04:34.260> actually<00:04:34.500> a<00:04:34.710> pretty<00:04:34.950> common<00:04:35.250> class<00:04:36.150> for<00:04:36.450> me

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
is actually a pretty common class for me

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.380 
is actually a pretty common class for me
I<00:04:36.570> always<00:04:36.750> run<00:04:37.260> UAV<00:04:37.680> I<00:04:38.670> think<00:04:39.030> it's<00:04:39.150> the<00:04:39.270> best

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
I always run UAV I think it's the best

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:42.830 
I always run UAV I think it's the best
kill<00:04:39.660> streak<00:04:39.690> in<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.140> game<00:04:40.350> I<00:04:41.060> think<00:04:42.060> UAV<00:04:42.810> and

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
kill streak in the game I think UAV and

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.320 
kill streak in the game I think UAV and
counter<00:04:43.290> UAV<00:04:43.440> have<00:04:43.770> got<00:04:44.010> to<00:04:44.130> be<00:04:44.160> two<00:04:45.150> of<00:04:45.270> the

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
counter UAV have got to be two of the

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.730 
counter UAV have got to be two of the
best<00:04:46.220> mainly<00:04:47.220> because<00:04:47.250> if<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:48.330> use<00:04:48.450> UAV<00:04:48.900> you

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
best mainly because if you use UAV you

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.860 
best mainly because if you use UAV you
can<00:04:49.920> see<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.250> other<00:04:50.370> team<00:04:50.640> and<00:04:50.850> if<00:04:51.540> you<00:04:51.660> use

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
can see the other team and if you use

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:54.500 
can see the other team and if you use
counter<00:04:52.140> UAV<00:04:52.670> they<00:04:53.670> don't<00:04:53.850> see<00:04:54.060> you<00:04:54.240> on<00:04:54.420> the

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:54.510 
counter UAV they don't see you on the

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:57.830 
counter UAV they don't see you on the
radar<00:04:54.600> and<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.470> think<00:04:55.530> that<00:04:55.800> that<00:04:56.510> could<00:04:57.510> be

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 
radar and I think that that could be

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.390 
radar and I think that that could be
almost<00:04:58.080> one<00:04:58.350> of<00:04:58.440> the<00:04:58.500> most<00:04:58.680> overpowered<00:04:59.220> kill

00:04:59.390 --> 00:04:59.400 
almost one of the most overpowered kill

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.030 
almost one of the most overpowered kill
streaks<00:04:59.640> in<00:04:59.730> the<00:04:59.790> game<00:05:00.590> aside<00:05:01.590> from<00:05:01.800> you<00:05:02.010> know

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
streaks in the game aside from you know

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.380 
streaks in the game aside from you know
the<00:05:02.660> kill<00:05:03.660> whoring<00:05:04.020> feels<00:05:04.350> free<00:05:04.970> which<00:05:05.970> I<00:05:06.120> suck

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
the kill whoring feels free which I suck

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.360 
the kill whoring feels free which I suck
with<00:05:06.950> because<00:05:07.950> we<00:05:08.460> just<00:05:08.670> took<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:08.820> lead<00:05:09.170> right

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
with because we just took the lead right

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:15.980 
with because we just took the lead right

your whole team which I think needs to

your whole team which I think needs to
happen<00:05:56.430> more<00:05:56.670> often<00:05:56.940> i<00:05:57.180> think<00:05:57.450> that's<00:05:57.630> that's

00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:58.290 
happen more often i think that's that's

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:59.780 
happen more often i think that's that's
the<00:05:58.650> main<00:05:58.830> reason<00:05:58.860> why<00:05:59.220> don't<00:05:59.430> like<00:05:59.580> kill

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
the main reason why don't like kill

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.840 
the main reason why don't like kill
streaks<00:06:00.060> on<00:06:00.180> this<00:06:00.330> game<00:06:00.590> is<00:06:01.590> because<00:06:01.770> it<00:06:02.550> makes

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
streaks on this game is because it makes

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:09.680 
streaks on this game is because it makes
people<00:06:03.120> run<00:06:04.070> 5<00:06:05.070> 7<00:06:05.490> 11<00:06:05.580> or<00:06:06.090> 579<00:06:06.870> or<00:06:07.490> five<00:06:08.490> 911<00:06:08.910> or

whatever you know and that is just I

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:13.850 
whatever you know and that is just I
don't<00:06:12.810> think<00:06:13.230> that<00:06:13.410> should<00:06:13.590> be<00:06:13.650> the

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860 
don't think that should be the
