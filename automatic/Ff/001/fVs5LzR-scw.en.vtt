to pull out this shield it's it's

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.500 
to pull out this shield it's it's
against<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.309> battery<00:00:35.610> box<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:36.059> the<00:00:36.149> bottom

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
against the battery box on the bottom

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.970 
against the battery box on the bottom
you've<00:00:36.930> got<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.170> get<00:00:37.290> underneath<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.829> wheel

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
you've got to get underneath the wheel

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.430 
you've got to get underneath the wheel
well<00:00:38.420> and<00:00:39.420> there's<00:00:39.690> two<00:00:39.840> bolts<00:00:40.140> on<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> bottom

that hold it to the bottom of this

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.160 
that hold it to the bottom of this
toolbox<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.860> kind<00:00:44.070> of<00:00:44.190> see<00:00:44.370> it<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.730> then<00:00:45.390> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
toolbox and kind of see it and then the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.830 
toolbox and kind of see it and then the
top<00:00:46.410> one<00:00:46.440> here<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.700> get<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.090> top<00:00:48.300> one<00:00:48.600> you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
top one here to get to the top one you

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.319 
top one here to get to the top one you
got<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.559> pull<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.800> seat<00:00:50.039> off<00:00:50.219> get<00:00:50.969> this<00:00:51.149> stuff

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
got to pull the seat off get this stuff

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.540 
got to pull the seat off get this stuff
out<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.600> way<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.050> then<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.890> tanks<00:00:53.250> got<00:00:53.399> to

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
out of the way and then the tanks got to

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.119 
out of the way and then the tanks got to
come<00:00:53.670> off<00:00:53.850> now<00:00:54.059> there's<00:00:54.239> a<00:00:54.300> rod<00:00:54.570> back<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.680> here

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
come off now there's a rod back in here

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.979 
come off now there's a rod back in here
once<00:00:56.760> this<00:00:56.969> out<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.300> way<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.449> can<00:00:57.629> see<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
once this out of the way you can see it

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.770 
once this out of the way you can see it
that<00:00:58.140> goes<00:00:58.289> straight<00:00:58.500> through<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.980> tank<00:00:59.309> and

00:00:59.770 --> 00:00:59.780 
that goes straight through the tank and

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.180 
that goes straight through the tank and
it's<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.930> one<00:01:01.079> simple<00:01:01.320> rod<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.890> unscrew

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
it's just one simple rod you unscrew

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.709 
it's just one simple rod you unscrew
that<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.730> whole<00:01:02.789> tank<00:01:03.090> will<00:01:03.300> pivot

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
that and the whole tank will pivot

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
that and the whole tank will pivot
upwards<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:04.500> can<00:01:05.010> get<00:01:05.100> access<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.640> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
upwards and you can get access to the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.030 
upwards and you can get access to the
top<00:01:06.119> screw<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.080> once<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:07.350> have<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.650> all<00:01:07.710> out

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
top screw so once you have that all out

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.030 
top screw so once you have that all out
of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> way<00:01:08.869> you're<00:01:09.869> ready<00:01:10.080> for<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
of the way you're ready for the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.700 
of the way you're ready for the
clearance<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:11.640> need<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.060> shock<00:01:12.710> now

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
clearance you need for the shock now

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.710 
clearance you need for the shock now
what<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:13.950> did<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.580> first<00:01:15.000> thing<00:01:15.180> I<00:01:15.299> did<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.479> I

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
what I did is first thing I did is I

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.539 
what I did is first thing I did is I
tied<00:01:15.930> off<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.110> front<00:01:16.439> brake<00:01:16.619> line<00:01:16.860> keep

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
tied off the front brake line keep

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.640 
tied off the front brake line keep
pressure<00:01:17.820> on<00:01:17.939> this<00:01:18.210> you<00:01:19.049> got<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.290> have<00:01:19.409> a<00:01:19.439> rear

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
pressure on this you got to have a rear

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.200 
pressure on this you got to have a rear
stand<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.189> mean<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.400> probably<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:20.759> about<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
stand I mean you probably do about it

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.240 
stand I mean you probably do about it
I'm<00:01:21.299> sure<00:01:21.330> but<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.960> just<00:01:22.140> makes<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.500> a<00:01:22.740> lot

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
I'm sure but it just makes it a lot

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.609 
I'm sure but it just makes it a lot
easier<00:01:23.390> put<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> rear<00:01:24.810> stand<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.439> then

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
easier put on the rear stand and then

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.160 
easier put on the rear stand and then
ratchet<00:01:26.580> straps<00:01:26.820> all<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.810> way<00:01:27.930> up<00:01:28.020> to<00:01:28.140> a

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
ratchet straps all the way up to a

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.170 
ratchet straps all the way up to a
crossbeam<00:01:28.710> I<00:01:28.920> have<00:01:29.130> to<00:01:29.790> hold<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.180> weight<00:01:30.890> so

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
crossbeam I have to hold the weight so

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.760 
crossbeam I have to hold the weight so
little<00:01:33.180> ratchet<00:01:33.509> them<00:01:33.659> up<00:01:33.780> evenly<00:01:34.170> want<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
little ratchet them up evenly want to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.109 
little ratchet them up evenly want to
probably<00:01:34.890> sufficient<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:35.670> I<00:01:35.700> just<00:01:35.850> put<00:01:35.970> two

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
probably sufficient but I just put two

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.539 
probably sufficient but I just put two
on<00:01:36.150> there<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.630> control<00:01:37.140> either<00:01:37.770> side<00:01:38.130> of<00:01:38.400> one

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
on there so I control either side of one

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.600 
on there so I control either side of one
side<00:01:38.820> down<00:01:39.030> after<00:01:39.329> another<00:01:40.220> so<00:01:41.220> once<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.490> have

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
side down after another so once you have

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
enough pressure and what it'll do is

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.720 
enough pressure and what it'll do is
they'll<00:03:21.959> move<00:03:22.829> this<00:03:23.070> just<00:03:23.310> enough<00:03:23.579> of<00:03:23.670> that

they'll move this just enough of that

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.009 
they'll move this just enough of that
bolt<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.150> come<00:03:24.299> out<00:03:24.450> and<00:03:24.600> might<00:03:24.780> they<00:03:24.989> just

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.150 
this side here you got pretty good
access<00:03:45.269> to<00:03:45.510> where<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:46.200> bolt<00:03:46.440> is<00:03:46.620> on<00:03:46.829> the<00:03:46.920> shock

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
access to where the bolt is on the shock

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:48.610 
access to where the bolt is on the shock
I<00:03:47.190> don't<00:03:47.549> know<00:03:47.609> if<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.730> can<00:03:47.850> see<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.209> a<00:03:48.239> field

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
I don't know if you can see that a field

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.640 
I don't know if you can see that a field
that's<00:03:49.620> where<00:03:49.799> it<00:03:49.890> was<00:03:50.040> that<00:03:50.310> so<00:03:51.000> I<00:03:51.359> came<00:03:52.170> in

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
that's where it was that so I came in

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.650 
that's where it was that so I came in
with<00:03:52.829> an<00:03:53.010> extension<00:03:53.430> piece<00:03:53.850> into<00:03:54.299> the<00:03:54.390> side

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
with an extension piece into the side

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.640 
with an extension piece into the side
with<00:03:55.500> the<00:03:55.650> 14<00:03:56.100> and<00:03:56.790> while<00:03:57.060> I<00:03:57.090> had<00:03:57.390> my<00:03:58.260> hand<00:03:58.500> on

with the 14 and while I had my hand on
it<00:03:58.799> on<00:03:58.920> that<00:03:59.070> end<00:03:59.250> I<00:03:59.370> came<00:03:59.519> in<00:03:59.670> with<00:03:59.790> a<00:03:59.820> wrench

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
it on that end I came in with a wrench

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.300 
it on that end I came in with a wrench
and<00:04:00.299> the<00:04:00.420> other<00:04:00.540> hand<00:04:00.810> stuck<00:04:01.200> my<00:04:01.350> hand<00:04:01.590> back

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
might be a little bit trouble but I have

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:07.370 
might be a little bit trouble but I have
pretty<00:04:06.150> big<00:04:06.329> hands<00:04:06.570> and<00:04:06.810> office<00:04:07.019> when<00:04:07.140> I<00:04:07.200> got

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:07.380 
pretty big hands and office when I got

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:07.740 
pretty big hands and office when I got
in<00:04:07.530> there

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
in there

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.440 
in there
fine<00:04:08.020> and<00:04:08.590> just<00:04:08.770> held<00:04:08.980> on<00:04:09.160> to<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.460> took<00:04:10.210> it<00:04:10.330> off

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:10.450 
fine and just held on to it took it off

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:11.820 
fine and just held on to it took it off
of<00:04:10.480> course<00:04:10.660> I<00:04:10.930> broke<00:04:11.140> it<00:04:11.290> loose<00:04:11.410> first<00:04:11.710> before

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 
of course I broke it loose first before

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:13.890 
of course I broke it loose first before
I<00:04:12.100> stuck<00:04:12.850> my<00:04:13.000> hand<00:04:13.150> in<00:04:13.270> there<00:04:13.420> and<00:04:13.600> did<00:04:13.720> that

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
I stuck my hand in there and did that

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.430 
I stuck my hand in there and did that
and<00:04:14.610> after<00:04:15.610> you<00:04:16.450> pull<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.900> out<00:04:16.959> put<00:04:17.320> your

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
and after you pull that out put your

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.750 
and after you pull that out put your
hand<00:04:17.560> on<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.739> bottom<00:04:17.980> of<00:04:18.100> shot<00:04:18.280> kind<00:04:18.640> of

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:18.760 
hand on the bottom of shot kind of

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.270 
hand on the bottom of shot kind of
jiggle<00:04:19.030> it<00:04:19.090> so<00:04:19.180> you<00:04:19.269> get<00:04:19.359> the<00:04:19.480> bolt<00:04:19.690> out<00:04:19.870> of<00:04:19.900> it

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
jiggle it so you get the bolt out of it

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.530 
jiggle it so you get the bolt out of it
after<00:04:21.280> you<00:04:21.340> pull<00:04:21.519> that<00:04:21.700> out<00:04:21.760> and<00:04:22.150> near<00:04:22.330> dusk

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
after you pull that out and near dusk

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.140 
after you pull that out and near dusk
pretty<00:04:23.140> much<00:04:23.290> set<00:04:23.530> to<00:04:23.680> go

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
pretty much set to go

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.920 
pretty much set to go
it's<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:26.140> my<00:04:26.260> understanding<00:04:26.530> that<00:04:27.810> you<00:04:28.810> know

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
it's to my understanding that you know

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:31.350 
it's to my understanding that you know
the<00:04:29.110> factory<00:04:30.010> bolt<00:04:30.280> for<00:04:30.790> the<00:04:30.820> bottom<00:04:31.210> of<00:04:31.300> the

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
the factory bolt for the bottom of the

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.440 
the factory bolt for the bottom of the
shock<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.650> dog<00:04:32.860> bone<00:04:33.190> does<00:04:33.700> not<00:04:33.910> work<00:04:34.180> with

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
shock to the dog bone does not work with

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:39.150 
shock to the dog bone does not work with
the<00:04:34.680> zx10<00:04:35.710> or<00:04:35.920> zx-14<00:04:36.820> shock<00:04:37.180> I<00:04:37.710> think<00:04:38.710> it<00:04:38.980> takes

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160 
the zx10 or zx-14 shock I think it takes

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.880 
the zx10 or zx-14 shock I think it takes
like<00:04:39.340> a<00:04:39.430> 10<00:04:39.640> 55<00:04:40.240> or<00:04:40.600> 54<00:04:41.320> or<00:04:41.590> something<00:04:41.830> like

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
like a 10 55 or 54 or something like

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.070 
like a 10 55 or 54 or something like
that

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
that

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.000 
that
so<00:04:44.080> I<00:04:44.110> might<00:04:44.440> have<00:04:44.500> to<00:04:45.840> buy<00:04:46.840> myself<00:04:46.990> a<00:04:47.230> bolt<00:04:47.470> so

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
so I might have to buy myself a bolt so

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:49.770 
so I might have to buy myself a bolt so
I<00:04:48.070> got<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.250> pretty<00:04:48.520> good<00:04:48.700> pretty<00:04:49.150> good<00:04:49.270> stack<00:04:49.630> of

I got a pretty good pretty good stack of

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.430 
I got a pretty good pretty good stack of
