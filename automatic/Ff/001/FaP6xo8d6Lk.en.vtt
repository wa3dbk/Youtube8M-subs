00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.400
 everything within 15 minutes 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:13.219
 the freighter can be removed 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.889
 must be out in the jargon called that 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:18.039
 whole climate up at lufthansa cargo 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:20.300
 It takes place for the first time 

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:22.849
 project manager bjÃ¶rn ostertag packs 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.500
 even with on from the kitchenette in the 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.980
 money goes directly to him for the next 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.980
 station 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:32.270
 Now we are in the discovered of the 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.620
 md-11 and as we see here is already 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.480
 not much to get out of 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.390
 have a difference to passenger machines 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.890
 we are not even a disguise anymore 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.440
 At the top you can see the buildings 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.450
 free rein so there it is 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.460
 not much to get out of it 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.800
 everything is working fast around 20 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.510
 technicians and pilots in parallel even if 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.290
 some items only a small one 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.510
 have weight 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.940
 so it comes down to every single kilo 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.100
 An therefore also in the cockpit 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.050
 the amount of each herb things removed 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.080
 There is a lot of accumulation here 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.309
 among other things , flashlights 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.950
 and headphones 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.140
 but you can save the kerosene 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.420
 actually accurate to a single kilo 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.890
 calculate 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.950
 yes we can calculate that very well 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.630
 a kilo of savings converted to the 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.110
 entire fleet and on all flights per 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.810
 year we save three tons of kerosene 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.210
 soya that's over nine tons of co2 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.330
 emissions that we save and thus 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.800
 accordingly relieve the environment 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.150
 everything that needs to be expanded 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.610
 be documented 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.390
 For that , every item has to be opened 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.520
 the scales 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.740
 This vending machine here serves the 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.979
 Crew members during their rest breaks 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.350
 as a support for the legs with 28 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.940
 kilograms, it is a heavyweight barely 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.740
 the weight, on the other hand, is falling 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.740
 toothpick with only five grams 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.670
 I noticed a mirror 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.150
 trained cockpit doors is mounted 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.010
 something unusual because the Lufthansa 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.210
 cargo of course only attractive pilots 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.690
 probably you will have this 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.880
 do not need mirror 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.560
 while the last parts from the 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.930
 aviators are weighed and sorted 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.540
 make the technicians of Lufthansa 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.680
 technology to the factory downtimes of a 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.660
 Aircraft are expensive 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.430
 because if a machine is not in the 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.070
 Air is then the airline can with it 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.470
 also no money earning therefore finds 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.030
 He also clarifies in the context of a maintenance 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.950
 instead of 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.530
 After almost three hours, all are loose 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.720
 Woven parts from the md 11 expanded 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:35.130
 and documented in the team will be the 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.270
 Results discussed as Easter Day Conclusion 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:39.370
 you can already say that is a 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.980
 The team has had a very successful day 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.110
 working together was very creative 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.990
 got quite a lot of on board 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.480
 in numbers 148 different items 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.340
 were bent and because we some 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:56.670
 have things on board several times if it is 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:59.020
 So 340 parts with a total of 480 kilo 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.390
 that was a lot of work but the real one 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.590
 work then begins in the next 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:04.540
 weeks or months we become ours 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.640
 to do homework still have by 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.530
 we participate every single one 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.060
 We need it to be followed up and examined 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.290
 really on board how much can we 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.570
 permanently save 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.820
 as soon as in the next few months everything 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:18.190
 is evaluated will show what that 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.110
 climate has actually brought in the 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.770
 kerosene consumption already counts 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.770
 smallest amount
