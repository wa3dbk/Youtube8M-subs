00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
looks like you just put it up I take

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.080 
looks like you just put it up I take
this<00:00:42.560> bigger<00:00:42.890> part<00:00:43.190> off<00:00:43.340> here<00:00:43.640> because<00:00:43.760> that

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
this bigger part off here because that

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.480 
this bigger part off here because that

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:48.490 
would take a long time to dehydrate and

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:50.470 
would take a long time to dehydrate and
it's<00:00:49.490> not<00:00:49.670> that<00:00:49.850> big<00:00:50.030> of<00:00:50.060> a<00:00:50.150> deal<00:00:50.240> we're<00:00:50.360> not
