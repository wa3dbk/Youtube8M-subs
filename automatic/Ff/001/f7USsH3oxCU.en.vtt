just keep it like a medium tension and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.719 
just keep it like a medium tension and
the<00:01:30.000> floor<00:01:30.210> tom<00:01:30.390> I<00:01:30.420> have<00:01:30.780> coated<00:01:31.079> Emperor

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
the floor tom I have coated Emperor

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:34.609 
the floor tom I have coated Emperor
which<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:33.150> use<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.600> Emperor<00:01:33.900> on<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.290> because

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
which I use the Emperor on that because

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.590 
which I use the Emperor on that because
it's<00:01:34.829> a<00:01:35.280> little<00:01:35.610> bit<00:01:35.759> bigger<00:01:36.000> and<00:01:36.210> ring<00:01:36.390> you're

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
it's a little bit bigger and ring you're

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.840 
it's a little bit bigger and ring you're
a<00:01:36.630> little<00:01:36.810> harder<00:01:37.049> to<00:01:37.170> control<00:01:37.500> so<00:01:38.369> the

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
a little harder to control so the

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.580 
a little harder to control so the
Emperor<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.420> a<00:01:39.450> kind<00:01:39.689> of<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.810> warmer<00:01:40.170> sound<00:01:40.409> a

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
Emperor is a kind of a warmer sound a

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.609 
Emperor is a kind of a warmer sound a
little<00:01:40.770> more<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.189> controlled<00:01:41.820> sound<00:01:42.350> so<00:01:43.350> I

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
little more of a controlled sound so I

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.410 
little more of a controlled sound so I
usually<00:01:43.920> find<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.369> like<00:01:44.579> a<00:01:44.610> bigger<00:01:44.939> drum<00:01:45.270> I

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
usually find that like a bigger drum I

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.179 
usually find that like a bigger drum I
want<00:01:45.630> like<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> little<00:01:45.960> more<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.439> like<00:01:46.860> a<00:01:46.890> deep

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
want like a little more of a like a deep

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.940 
want like a little more of a like a deep
warm<00:01:48.000> controlled<00:01:48.479> sound<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.590> with<00:01:49.649> smaller

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
warm controlled sound but with smaller

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.600 
warm controlled sound but with smaller
drama<00:01:50.340> more<00:01:50.880> of<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.000> ringing<00:01:51.180> sound<00:01:51.560> and<00:01:52.610> I

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
drama more of a ringing sound and I

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.010 
drama more of a ringing sound and I
think<00:01:54.540> overall

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
think overall

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.230 
think overall
either<00:01:55.380> way<00:01:55.590> though<00:01:55.770> like<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.340> trying<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
either way though like I like trying to

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.590 
either way though like I like trying to
get<00:01:57.420> something<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.990> can<00:01:58.969> mix<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.180> well<00:02:00.390> with

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
get something that can mix in well with

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.120 
get something that can mix in well with
a<00:02:00.659> live<00:02:00.899> band<00:02:00.930> setting<00:02:01.500> we<00:02:01.619> play<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.829> lot<00:02:01.979> of

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
a live band setting we play a lot of

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.039 
a live band setting we play a lot of
clubs<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> lot<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.060> live<00:02:03.240> loud

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.150 
clubs and we have a lot of live loud
instruments<00:02:04.680> so<00:02:05.670> I<00:02:05.700> think<00:02:06.030> overall<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.479> try<00:02:06.810> to

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
instruments so I think overall I try to

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.859 
instruments so I think overall I try to
cater<00:02:08.160> them<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.610> sounds<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.450> drums<00:02:09.720> too

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
cater them the sounds of the drums too

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.770 
cater them the sounds of the drums too
have<00:02:11.650> a<00:02:11.680> lot<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:11.950> attack<00:02:12.340> and<00:02:12.610> sound<00:02:12.849> like

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
have a lot of attack and sound like

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.740 
have a lot of attack and sound like
punch<00:02:14.530> through<00:02:14.800> the<00:02:14.950> rest<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.220> the<00:02:15.310> music

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
punch through the rest of the music

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.270

overall<00:02:16.750> just<00:02:17.050> kind<00:02:17.290> of<00:02:17.349> like<00:02:17.560> over<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.010> snare

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
overall just kind of like over the snare

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.330 
overall just kind of like over the snare
-<00:02:18.690> usually<00:02:19.690> don't<00:02:19.840> like<00:02:19.959> it<00:02:20.080> too<00:02:20.200> ringy<00:02:20.500> just

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
- usually don't like it too ringy just

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.890 
- usually don't like it too ringy just
so<00:02:21.580> that<00:02:21.730> it<00:02:21.849> has<00:02:22.000> more<00:02:22.360> of<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.480> percussive

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
so that it has more of a percussive

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.470 
so that it has more of a percussive
sound<00:02:23.140> rather<00:02:23.380> than<00:02:23.760> too<00:02:24.760> much<00:02:24.790> time<00:02:25.180> too<00:02:25.450> much

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
sound rather than too much time too much

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.070 
sound rather than too much time too much
ring<00:02:25.810> over<00:02:26.709> the<00:02:26.830> the<00:02:27.280> other<00:02:27.400> instruments<00:02:28.080> get

inch<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:21.070> think<00:03:21.549> I<00:03:21.880> think<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:22.900> probably<00:03:23.109> prefer

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
inch I think I think I probably prefer

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.069 
inch I think I think I probably prefer
the<00:03:23.620> 13<00:03:24.010> or<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.820> 14<00:03:25.150> although<00:03:25.420> with<00:03:25.600> more<00:03:25.810> room

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
the 13 or the 14 although with more room

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.470 
the 13 or the 14 although with more room
will<00:03:26.260> probably<00:03:26.530> have<00:03:26.620> 13<00:03:26.980> and<00:03:27.130> the<00:03:27.190> 14<00:03:27.549> but<00:03:27.790> if

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
will probably have 13 and the 14 but if

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.150 
will probably have 13 and the 14 but if
I<00:03:28.630> have<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.870> just<00:03:28.989> use<00:03:29.140> one<00:03:29.380> in<00:03:29.500> probably<00:03:29.739> 13<00:03:30.130> I

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:30.160 
I have to just use one in probably 13 I

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.479 
I have to just use one in probably 13 I
think<00:03:30.400> just<00:03:30.609> because<00:03:30.760> uh<00:03:32.190> just<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.250> give<00:03:33.370> it<00:03:33.400> a

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
think just because uh just to give it a

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.880 
think just because uh just to give it a
like<00:03:33.609> a<00:03:33.640> little<00:03:34.030> higher<00:03:34.209> ringing<00:03:34.720> sound<00:03:35.079> this

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
like a little higher ringing sound this

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.039 
like a little higher ringing sound this
thing<00:03:35.950> seems<00:03:36.400> pretty<00:03:36.609> deep<00:03:36.910> so<00:03:37.269> it<00:03:37.569> has<00:03:37.870> like

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
thing seems pretty deep so it has like

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.110
