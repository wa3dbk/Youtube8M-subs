 Thousandths of a second minutes 

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:20.449
 and all in just under 25 hours something can not quite agree who that 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.849
 Minor baskets prevailed many out to 25 hours to multiply 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:26.769
 2500 minutes 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.949

 that's about it 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.230
 but obviously a scam are going to happen and that with the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.340
 Obligation worked 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:01.030
 then on 17 now he received another call that this percent was 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.790
 so and also those who did not help and steered their allegations and mine 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.650
 against 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.970

 Way interface 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.480

 more is normal or old is chargeable 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.250
 but it is not an isolated case but an organized one
