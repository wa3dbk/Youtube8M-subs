00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
hole in it that's pretty big okay but

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.969 
hole in it that's pretty big okay but
this<00:01:31.590> makes<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.009> a<00:01:32.220> little<00:01:32.579> thicker<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:37.320> I've

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
okay I'll give it a nice edge to do this

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.570 
okay I'll give it a nice edge to do this
you<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.230> squeeze<00:02:34.590> and<00:02:34.770> hold<00:02:34.980> in<00:02:35.100> place<00:02:35.310> until

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
a sort of mound forms then you release

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.950 
a sort of mound forms then you release
the<00:02:38.370> pressure<00:02:38.400> as<00:02:38.790> you<00:02:38.820> pull<00:02:39.150> down<00:02:39.180> you

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
the pressure as you pull down you

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.810 
the pressure as you pull down you
actually<00:02:40.260> sort<00:02:40.440> of<00:02:40.530> change<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.010> angle<00:02:41.550> of<00:02:41.730> the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
actually sort of change the angle of the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.180 
actually sort of change the angle of the
tip<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.450> then<00:02:43.080> just<00:02:43.230> go<00:02:43.410> around<00:02:43.680> the<00:02:44.130> entire

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
tip and then just go around the entire

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.520 
tip and then just go around the entire
edge<00:02:44.760> you<00:02:45.240> don't<00:02:45.420> take<00:02:45.570> it<00:02:45.720> off<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.110> just<00:02:46.140> keep

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
edge you don't take it off you just keep

edge you don't take it off you just keep
yeah<00:02:46.800> just<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.220> can<00:02:47.370> just<00:02:47.520> do<00:02:47.610> it<00:02:47.640> in<00:02:47.760> one

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
yeah just you can just do it in one

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.330 
yeah just you can just do it in one
fluid<00:02:48.180> motion<00:02:48.510> for<00:02:49.050> this<00:02:49.170> okay<00:02:49.709> that's<00:02:50.010> really

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
fluid motion for this okay that's really

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:52.100 
fluid motion for this okay that's really
beautiful<00:02:50.790> I<00:02:51.000> mean<00:02:51.120> that's<00:02:51.390> I'm<00:02:51.630> sure<00:02:51.930> that

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
beautiful I mean that's I'm sure that

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.300 
beautiful I mean that's I'm sure that
that<00:02:52.200> takes<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.470> little<00:02:52.650> bit<00:02:52.740> of<00:02:52.830> practice<00:02:52.950> a

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
that takes a little bit of practice a

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.830 
that takes a little bit of practice a
little<00:02:53.430> bit<00:02:53.640> yeah<00:02:53.880> but<00:02:54.090> you<00:02:54.270> know<00:02:54.360> what<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.600> have

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
something called a crazy border which I

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.220 
something called a crazy border which I
use<00:02:56.820> a<00:02:56.850> lot<00:02:57.120> and<00:02:57.330> it's<00:02:57.450> great<00:02:57.600> for<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.840> novice

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230
