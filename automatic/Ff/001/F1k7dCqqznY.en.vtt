00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.290
 at the moment, the game is now following 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:12.170
 katar and the hat and respect many 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.170
 liberties for willibert pauels 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.820
 Yes 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.990
 Yes 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:35.260
 since all 

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:37.890
 in the hair as in old times take 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.129
 however, the stage and what music played 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.949
 daughter it is not that way 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.420
 host of the brewery on it 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.909
 we have passed the song 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.680
 It's not like I want to play 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:54.339
 just a little explanation because 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.869
 all gaps like every animal for and before 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.940
 all things that many people have 

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:00.369
 it also just mentioned the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.619
 the light in the cochrane and say yes 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:04.899
 how far his lust her human and then 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:08.319
 He also makes it public with it 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:11.920
 a depression in the hospital 

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:14.950
 Psychiatry was too quiet 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.920
 it is taboo in wollerau but it is bursting 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.380
 in not so we have now 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:24.340
 has my doctor told me mr pauls 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:27.759
 already 2000 years ago the 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.819
 Greek philosopher always said we 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.520
 mine always mean things are us 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:34.810
 make it unhappy so that's right 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.819
 mostly not 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.220
 It's not the things that are us 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.069
 unhappy but how we do that 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.800
 see things 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:47.229
 the decisive factor is the perspective 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.869
 pauls and that's what we train here 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.599
 Perspective or change it 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:55.349
 I would have liked earlier 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:59.470
 Rhineland belongs to a country 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:02.170
 master in the change of perspective already 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.209
 In the language never three countries can 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.800
 they do not name things differently 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.709
 bad 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:12.640
 example the hard word extramarital 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.430
 affäre means in rhine 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.859
 firmly 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.920
 Still shit sounds better though 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:28.230
 or depression means yes to pure me 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.359
 you beautiful and then went through me so 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.760
 the head 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:35.700
 Basically, this insight is taken 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.469
 that perspective is the key 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:42.989
 is the same in all three areas 

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:46.590
 I have just explained the therapy 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.989
 but in joke, too, the joke lives on it 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.549
 that he surprisingly another 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.700
 perspective 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:57.379
 and if that succeeds all aggression 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:01.739
 and so on away an example 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:06.120
 düsseldorfer stands from the sky gate he 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:09.569
 ringing the Kläppchen goes to holy 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:14.219
 Petrus yes please I come from 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:17.459
 Dusseldorf wants a sky cabin 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:21.030
 I have my whole life I have 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:24.000
 church tax paid for what was most there 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:27.329
 I've got all of my money together 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:31.349
 life i have to pay tax return what 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:34.310
 i think petrus well alright i ask 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:38.340
 Chef Petrus runs in the Hamilton Gives 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.790
 could a few minutes again everything in 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.699

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:47.740

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:51.890
 I do not like twitter 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:55.880
 this wonderful wonderful liberating 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:59.240
 power in the joke and the eyes of the 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.920
 yes religion on the soul of 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:07.310
 He seems to be closing in on people 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:11.560
 Can you sing the glorious now? 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.900
 kitten from the lot 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.510
 when the battery 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:18.940
 he comes from 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:24.630
 and then stretch over everything 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:29.630
 always satisfied completely 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:35.300
 offered her free to renault again 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:39.500
 because the ship with 50 or young with 85 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:43.580
 but groups were formerly 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:49.600
 Nicely fulfilled nothing and everyone 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.600
 third of the 2 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:00.430
 jahns here 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.870

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.460
 and the autumn stops 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.980

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:19.190
 absolutely normal 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.510
