make<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.280> to<00:02:42.400> North<00:02:42.609> America<00:02:43.180> so<00:02:44.069> key<00:02:45.069> standard

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
make it to North America so key standard

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.149 
make it to North America so key standard
traditional<00:02:45.880> key

00:02:51.149 --> 00:02:51.159 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.709 

well<00:02:52.159> that's<00:02:52.310> cool<00:02:52.579> so<00:02:53.000> let's<00:02:53.030> take<00:02:53.390> a<00:02:53.420> look<00:02:53.599> at

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:53.719 
well that's cool so let's take a look at

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:55.539 
well that's cool so let's take a look at
a<00:02:53.750> few<00:02:53.870> other<00:02:54.049> options<00:02:54.260> here<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:55.099> stereo

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
a few other options here the stereo

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.289 
a few other options here the stereo
system<00:02:55.819> is<00:02:56.500> by<00:02:57.500> a<00:02:57.530> company<00:02:58.159> called<00:02:58.299> parrot

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
system is by a company called parrot

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.459 
system is by a company called parrot
it's<00:03:00.109> a<00:03:00.379> smart<00:03:01.159> system<00:03:01.579> that<00:03:01.730> has<00:03:01.879> contacts<00:03:02.569> it

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:03.469 
it's a smart system that has contacts it

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:06.009 
it's a smart system that has contacts it
has<00:03:03.680> voice<00:03:03.980> commands<00:03:04.579> and<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.209> have<00:03:05.420> no<00:03:05.719> idea

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
has voice commands and I have no idea

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.610 
has voice commands and I have no idea
how<00:03:06.170> it<00:03:06.319> works<00:03:07.510> but<00:03:08.510> forget<00:03:08.870> the<00:03:09.019> stereo<00:03:09.439> and

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
how it works but forget the stereo and

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:21.730 
how it works but forget the stereo and
instead<00:03:10.219> listen<00:03:10.670> to<00:03:11.000> the<00:03:11.090> raising<00:03:11.450> exhaust

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:21.740 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:26.900 

that's<00:03:22.740> awesome<00:03:25.340> down<00:03:26.340> here<00:03:26.400> there's<00:03:26.850> a

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
that's awesome down here there's a

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.510 
that's awesome down here there's a
control<00:03:27.300> where<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.450> can<00:03:27.630> go<00:03:27.750> into<00:03:28.520> dynamic

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
control where you can go into dynamic

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.220 
control where you can go into dynamic
mode<00:03:29.790> which<00:03:30.150> would<00:03:30.360> be<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.870> a<00:03:30.900> track-day

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
mode which would be like a track-day

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.520 
mode which would be like a track-day
special<00:03:31.830> mode<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:32.670> also<00:03:32.700> have<00:03:33.270> natural<00:03:34.110> which

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
special mode you also have natural which

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.500 
special mode you also have natural which
is<00:03:34.710> just<00:03:34.980> for<00:03:35.100> everyday<00:03:35.340> driving<00:03:35.490> and<00:03:36.120> then

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
is just for everyday driving and then

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.930 
is just for everyday driving and then
down<00:03:36.690> here<00:03:36.960> you<00:03:37.140> have<00:03:37.170> all<00:03:37.620> weather<00:03:38.220> that<00:03:38.910> is

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
down here you have all weather that is

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.600 
down here you have all weather that is
of<00:03:39.210> course<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.810> minimize<00:03:40.470> slip<00:03:40.980> this<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.580> a

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
of course to minimize slip this is a

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.300 
of course to minimize slip this is a
rear-wheel<00:03:42.120> drive<00:03:42.230> rear-engine<00:03:43.230> car<00:03:43.500> and

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
rear-wheel drive rear-engine car and

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:45.920 
rear-wheel drive rear-engine car and
that<00:03:44.550> makes<00:03:44.790> for<00:03:45.030> some<00:03:45.180> interesting<00:03:45.810> dynamics

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
that makes for some interesting dynamics

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.250 
that makes for some interesting dynamics
in<00:03:46.560> slippery<00:03:47.130> weather<00:03:47.780> so<00:03:48.780> let's<00:03:48.960> talk<00:03:49.080> about

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
in slippery weather so let's talk about

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.560 
in slippery weather so let's talk about
