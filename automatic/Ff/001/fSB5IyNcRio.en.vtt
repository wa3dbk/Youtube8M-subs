for<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.770> LCD<00:00:56.160> display<00:00:57.140> you'll<00:00:58.140> want<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
for the LCD display you'll want to

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.340 
for the LCD display you'll want to
remove<00:00:58.710> these<00:00:59.070> two<00:00:59.280> screws<00:00:59.309> at<00:00:59.879> one<00:01:00.149> hand<00:01:00.480> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
remove these two screws at one hand and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.609 
remove these two screws at one hand and
one<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:02.010> over<00:01:02.280> here<00:01:02.870> why<00:01:03.870> did<00:01:04.110> this<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.409> just

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
one just over here why did this I just

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.230 
one just over here why did this I just
move<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> speedo<00:01:05.189> because<00:01:05.820> that's<00:01:06.030> just

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
move the speedo because that's just

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.300 
move the speedo because that's just
attached<00:01:06.510> by<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:07.020> little<00:01:07.619> wire<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.070> you<00:01:08.130> can

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
attached by a little wire so you can

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.179 
attached by a little wire so you can
access<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.729> screw<00:01:08.970> bit<00:01:09.150> easier

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
access the screw bit easier

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.539 
access the screw bit easier
so<00:01:11.189> once<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.060> remove<00:01:12.150> these<00:01:12.510> two<00:01:13.490> do<00:01:14.490> it

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
so once you remove these two do it

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.090 
so once you remove these two do it
quickly

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:34.109
