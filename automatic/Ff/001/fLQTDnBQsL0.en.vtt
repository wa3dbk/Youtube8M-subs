going to go back down to our middle the

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:59.230 
going to go back down to our middle the
YG<00:02:55.940> 03<00:02:56.660> and<00:02:56.870> just<00:02:57.470> go<00:02:57.650> over<00:02:57.830> the<00:02:58.100> top<00:02:58.310> up<00:02:58.910> to

where we went before and that's going to

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.699 
where we went before and that's going to
soften<00:03:01.459> those<00:03:01.610> edges<00:03:02.150> so<00:03:02.930> we<00:03:03.050> get<00:03:03.200> a<00:03:03.230> lovely

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709

soften those edges so we get a lovely
blend<00:03:04.010> rather<00:03:04.430> than<00:03:04.700> hard<00:03:05.000> lines<00:03:05.330> and<00:03:05.870> you<00:03:06.380> can

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
blend rather than hard lines and you can

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.440 
blend rather than hard lines and you can
even<00:03:06.770> go<00:03:07.010> over<00:03:07.040> it<00:03:07.310> in<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.430> circular<00:03:07.670> motion<00:03:08.060> at

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
even go over it in a circular motion at

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.910 
even go over it in a circular motion at
the<00:03:08.630> pit<00:03:08.930> at<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.290> end<00:03:09.410> it'll<00:03:09.590> give<00:03:09.770> you<00:03:09.890> a

bit<00:03:29.660> difficult<00:03:30.020> to<00:03:30.440> color<00:03:30.770> with<00:03:30.860> but<00:03:31.430> if<00:03:31.550> you

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
bit difficult to color with but if you

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:33.910 
bit difficult to color with but if you
get<00:03:31.910> your<00:03:32.120> numbers<00:03:32.480> just<00:03:32.780> two<00:03:33.110> or<00:03:33.320> three<00:03:33.350> apart

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
get your numbers just two or three apart

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.800 
get your numbers just two or three apart
rather<00:03:34.160> than<00:03:34.489> five<00:03:34.760> or<00:03:34.940> six<00:03:35.150> apart<00:03:35.480> you'll

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
rather than five or six apart you'll

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.720 
rather than five or six apart you'll
have<00:03:35.930> a<00:03:35.989> much<00:03:36.080> easier<00:03:36.470> time<00:03:36.830> of<00:03:37.040> blending<00:03:37.580> them
