it<00:01:17.790> wouldn't<00:01:18.090> be<00:01:18.240> fun<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.780> method<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.530> was

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
it wouldn't be fun one method it was

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.620 
it wouldn't be fun one method it was
tomorrow<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.460> now<00:01:20.580> he's<00:01:20.820> growing<00:01:21.390> but

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
tomorrow and now he's growing but

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.240 
tomorrow and now he's growing but
there's<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.930> smaller<00:01:22.320> when<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.560> compare<00:01:23.040> him

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
there's a smaller when you compare him

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.890 
there's a smaller when you compare him
to<00:01:23.280> show<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.729> others<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:26.520> one<00:01:26.729> and<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.720> one

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
to show the others that one and that one

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.539 
to show the others that one and that one
there<00:01:28.140> is<00:01:28.380> quite<00:01:28.650> as<00:01:28.770> different<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.220> guess<00:01:29.369> it's

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
there is quite as different I guess it's

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.109 
there is quite as different I guess it's
hard<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.909> see<00:01:30.180> on<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.479> camera<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.820> they<00:01:32.820> still

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
hard to see on the camera but they still

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.370 
hard to see on the camera but they still
like<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> light<00:01:33.780> though

also have a guy down by the basketball
court<00:02:38.519> but<00:02:38.670> I'm<00:02:38.790> sure<00:02:39.030> he'll<00:02:39.239> want<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.510> try<00:02:39.750> to

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
court but I'm sure he'll want to try to

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.180 
court but I'm sure he'll want to try to
spread<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> little<00:02:40.530> bit<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.739> this<00:02:40.859> around<00:02:43.190> still

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:44.190 
spread a little bit of this around still

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:46.099 
spread a little bit of this around still
long<00:02:44.400> he<00:02:44.670> spends<00:02:45.060> it<00:02:45.150> really<00:02:45.660> really<00:02:45.870> lightly

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:46.109 
long he spends it really really lightly

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:47.720 
long he spends it really really lightly
he'll<00:02:46.500> be<00:02:46.620> fine<00:02:46.859> in<00:02:46.889> areas<00:02:47.430> where<00:02:47.549> he's<00:02:47.670> gonna

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
he'll be fine in areas where he's gonna

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:55.150 
he'll be fine in areas where he's gonna
plant<00:02:48.290> in<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.440> next<00:02:49.560> couple<00:02:49.829> of<00:02:49.980> years

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.640 

again<00:02:56.160> I'm<00:02:56.340> familiar<00:02:56.580> with<00:02:57.210> us<00:02:57.390> even<00:02:58.350> even

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
again I'm familiar with us even even

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.210 
again I'm familiar with us even even
with<00:02:58.770> the<00:02:58.920> manure<00:02:59.280> this<00:02:59.850> all<00:03:00.030> gets<00:03:00.270> cleaned<00:03:00.690> up

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
with the manure this all gets cleaned up

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.010 
with the manure this all gets cleaned up
but<00:03:02.220> falls<00:03:02.550> down<00:03:02.820> in<00:03:02.970> between<00:03:03.270> all<00:03:03.600> that<00:03:03.630> gets

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:04.020 
but falls down in between all that gets

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:08.000 
but falls down in between all that gets
cleaned<00:03:04.320> up<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:04.680> back<00:03:04.890> down<00:03:06.590> but<00:03:07.590> even<00:03:07.860> with

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
cleaned up and back down but even with

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.800 
cleaned up and back down but even with
them<00:03:08.130> in<00:03:08.280> new<00:03:08.430> rooms<00:03:08.760> very<00:03:08.940> familiar<00:03:09.630> because

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
them in new rooms very familiar because

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.610 
them in new rooms very familiar because
of<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.970> farm<00:03:11.970> out<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.390> work<00:03:12.570> zone<00:03:12.930> and

although<00:03:16.620> it's<00:03:16.920> very<00:03:16.980> hot<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:19.620> manure<00:03:19.980> is

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
although it's very hot the manure is

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.710 
although it's very hot the manure is
very<00:03:20.460> hot<00:03:21.290> it<00:03:22.290> still<00:03:22.770> will<00:03:23.160> be<00:03:23.720> really

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
very hot it still will be really

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.080 
very hot it still will be really
effective<00:03:25.230> in<00:03:25.350> a<00:03:25.410> couple<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:25.890> years<00:03:26.130> they<00:03:27.060> put

effective in a couple of years they put

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.390 
effective in a couple of years they put
it<00:03:27.390> in<00:03:27.540> areas<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:28.050> there<00:03:28.500> might<00:03:28.890> be<00:03:28.920> growing

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
it in areas that there might be growing

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.000 
it in areas that there might be growing
in<00:03:29.820> where<00:03:30.630> you<00:03:30.750> put<00:03:30.990> an<00:03:31.080> area<00:03:31.290> where<00:03:31.560> nothing's
