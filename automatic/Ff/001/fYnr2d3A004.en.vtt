00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
just draw into it next turn we're able

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.240 
just draw into it next turn we're able
to<00:01:27.479> actually<00:01:27.540> add<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.049> to<00:01:28.140> a<00:01:28.170> hand<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:29.040> this

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
to actually add it to a hand with this

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.910 
to actually add it to a hand with this
if<00:01:29.610> we're<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.869> board<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.930> course<00:01:31.200> which<00:01:31.680> that's

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
if we're a board of course which that's

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.310 
if we're a board of course which that's
a<00:01:32.009> really<00:01:32.220> neat<00:01:32.490> interaction<00:01:33.119> but<00:01:33.990> other<00:01:34.200> than

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
a really neat interaction but other than

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.830 
a really neat interaction but other than
that<00:01:34.439> it<00:01:35.189> also<00:01:35.700> helps<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.180> blind

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
that it also helps with blind

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.679 
that it also helps with blind
excavations<00:01:37.680> so<00:01:38.040> if<00:01:38.340> we<00:01:38.579> were<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> blindly

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
excavations so if we were to blindly

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:40.999 
excavations so if we were to blindly
excavate<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> know<00:01:40.409> we<00:01:40.530> didn't<00:01:40.770> stack

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
excavate you know we didn't stack

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.410 
excavate you know we didn't stack

guess<00:01:46.130> it<00:01:47.130> really<00:01:47.520> does<00:01:47.850> help<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.329> sense

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
guess it really does help in the sense

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.840 
guess it really does help in the sense
where<00:01:48.750> if<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.049> do<00:01:49.259> accidentally<00:01:50.040> hit<00:01:50.670> a

any<00:01:53.130> other<00:01:53.310> Sylvan<00:01:53.729> monster<00:01:54.030> would<00:01:54.180> go<00:01:54.329> back

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
any other Sylvan monster would go back

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.969 
any other Sylvan monster would go back
to<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> bottom<00:01:54.960> of<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.110> deck<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:55.799> with

to the bottom of the deck but with

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.370 
to the bottom of the deck but with
princess<00:01:56.460> sprite<00:01:57.090> here<00:01:57.390> it<00:01:57.899> could<00:01:58.079> go<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.229> your

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
princess sprite here it could go to your

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.020 
princess sprite here it could go to your
hand<00:01:58.560> instead<00:01:58.829> which<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.280> really<00:01:59.460> helpful<00:01:59.729> so

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
hand instead which is really helpful so

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.249 
hand instead which is really helpful so
either<00:02:00.270> way<00:02:00.450> you're<00:02:00.570> going<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:00.750> get<00:02:00.810> some<00:02:01.049> sort

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
either way you're going to get some sort

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
of advantage because if it is a sew-in

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.819 
of advantage because if it is a sew-in
monster<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.329> excavated<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.530> get<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
monster you excavated it so you get the
