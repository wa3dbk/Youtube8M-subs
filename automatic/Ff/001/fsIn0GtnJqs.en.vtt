made<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:07.650> many<00:01:07.710> mistakes<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.490> past<00:01:08.520> i

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
made so many mistakes in the past i

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.910 
made so many mistakes in the past i
think<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.299> bollywood<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.500> reason<00:01:10.710> why<00:01:10.830> I'm

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
think in bollywood the reason why I'm

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.560 
think in bollywood the reason why I'm
taking<00:01:11.070> my<00:01:11.340> time<00:01:11.520> is<00:01:11.700> because<00:01:11.820> I've<00:01:12.030> made<00:01:12.270> so

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
taking my time is because I've made so

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.210 
taking my time is because I've made so
many<00:01:12.630> mistakes<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:13.320> suppose<00:01:13.619> in<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.830> past<00:01:14.040> and

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
many mistakes I suppose in the past and

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.039 
many mistakes I suppose in the past and
again<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.490> was<00:01:14.729> naive<00:01:15.060> I<00:01:15.180> was<00:01:15.210> young<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.720> think<00:01:15.960> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
again I was naive I was young I think I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.260 
again I was naive I was young I think I
was<00:01:16.229> can<00:01:16.950> probably<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.400> condoned<00:01:17.790> for<00:01:18.150> that

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
was can probably be condoned for that

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.340 
was can probably be condoned for that
mm-hmm<00:01:18.900> um<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.729> think<00:01:21.150> mistakes<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.110> way

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
mm-hmm um but I think mistakes in a way

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.260 
mm-hmm um but I think mistakes in a way
is<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.500> good<00:01:22.680> thing<00:01:22.830> if<00:01:23.430> you<00:01:23.610> don't<00:01:23.790> repeat<00:01:24.060> them

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
is a good thing if you don't repeat them

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.149 
is a good thing if you don't repeat them
is<00:01:24.420> even<00:01:25.290> better<00:01:25.380> we<00:01:25.619> have<00:01:25.740> any<00:01:25.890> bitten

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
is even better we have any bitten

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.700 
is even better we have any bitten
probably<00:01:26.189> become<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> habit<00:01:27.110> but<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.350> completely

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
probably become a habit but I completely

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.620 
probably become a habit but I completely
relate<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.880> know<00:01:29.970> with<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.210> he's<00:01:30.360> saying

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
relate to you know with what he's saying

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.719 
relate to you know with what he's saying
it's<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.829> so<00:01:31.979> true<00:01:32.189> sometimes<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.640> don't

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
it's it's so true sometimes you don't

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.859 
it's it's so true sometimes you don't
believe<00:01:33.030> in<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.360> then<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.509> speak<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
believe in it and then you speak to the

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.420 
believe in it and then you speak to the
director<00:01:34.049> about<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:34.740> then<00:01:34.829> he<00:01:34.920> convinces

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
director about it and then he convinces

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
maybe now you feel they give lesson but

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.759 
maybe now you feel they give lesson but
i<00:03:07.540> guess<00:03:07.780> i<00:03:07.959> took<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.290> what<00:03:08.470> do<00:03:08.530> you<00:03:08.560> think<00:03:08.709> is

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
i guess i took it what do you think is

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.259 
i guess i took it what do you think is
more<00:03:08.799> competitive<00:03:09.340> race<00:03:09.489> not<00:03:09.639> asking<00:03:10.030> you<00:03:10.120> to

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:10.269 
more competitive race not asking you to

more competitive race not asking you to
yeah<00:03:10.389> i<00:03:10.450> think<00:03:10.569> it's<00:03:10.780> what<00:03:10.870> better<00:03:11.109> right<00:03:11.319> now

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:11.530 
yeah i think it's what better right now

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:13.259 
yeah i think it's what better right now
i<00:03:11.799> think<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:12.310> audience<00:03:12.459> has<00:03:12.700> less<00:03:12.849> patience

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
i think the audience has less patience

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.449 
i think the audience has less patience
now<00:03:13.389> than<00:03:13.599> they<00:03:13.750> used<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.989> earlier<00:03:14.290> I<00:03:14.530> don't

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
now than they used to earlier I don't
