but the charity was only created last

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.840 
but the charity was only created last
year<00:00:21.420> but<00:00:22.200> the<00:00:22.380> reason<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.040> charity<00:00:23.700> was

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
year but the reason that the charity was

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.150 
year but the reason that the charity was
created<00:00:24.240> was<00:00:24.750> because<00:00:25.170> my<00:00:25.380> son<00:00:25.590> Sam<00:00:25.890> had

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
created was because my son Sam had

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.109 
created was because my son Sam had
leukemia<00:00:26.610> who<00:00:26.759> was<00:00:26.880> diagnosed<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.509> 1995<00:00:28.290> and

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:29.119 
leukemia who was diagnosed in 1995 and

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.890 
leukemia who was diagnosed in 1995 and
his<00:00:30.119> diagnosis<00:00:30.810> came<00:00:31.080> with<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.560> sort<00:00:32.400> of

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
his diagnosis came with the sort of

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.939 
his diagnosis came with the sort of
mindset<00:00:33.900> that<00:00:34.110> he<00:00:34.320> would<00:00:34.500> not<00:00:34.530> live<00:00:34.800> for

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:34.949 
mindset that he would not live for

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:36.500 
mindset that he would not live for
longer<00:00:35.160> than<00:00:35.190> about<00:00:35.370> three<00:00:35.520> months<00:00:35.820> so

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
longer than about three months so

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.970 
longer than about three months so
because<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.840> that<00:00:36.960> we<00:00:37.230> looked<00:00:37.410> at<00:00:37.470> alternative

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
because of that we looked at alternative

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.920 
because of that we looked at alternative
ways<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.250> helping<00:00:38.430> with<00:00:38.790> him<00:00:38.970> and<00:00:39.180> over<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
ways of helping with him and over the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.330 
ways of helping with him and over the
following<00:00:40.080> three<00:00:40.530> years<00:00:40.769> which<00:00:40.980> he<00:00:41.129> lived

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
following three years which he lived

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.939 
following three years which he lived
with<00:00:42.030> leukemia<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.230> became<00:00:43.620> very<00:00:43.680> obvious

00:00:43.939 --> 00:00:43.949 
with leukemia it became very obvious

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.950 
with leukemia it became very obvious
that<00:00:44.580> his<00:00:44.730> quality<00:00:45.120> of<00:00:45.150> life<00:00:45.300> is<00:00:45.570> improved<00:00:45.900> by

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
that his quality of life is improved by

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.439 
that his quality of life is improved by
healing<00:00:46.260> conventional<00:00:47.250> medicine<00:00:47.610> is<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.000> so

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
healing conventional medicine is is so

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.360 
healing conventional medicine is is so
