00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
be using the same scarf for each style

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.360 
be using the same scarf for each style
and<00:00:57.899> I'm<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.079> using<00:00:58.199> my<00:00:58.440> favorite<00:00:58.859> white<00:00:59.100> one

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
and I'm just using my favorite white one

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.540 
and I'm just using my favorite white one
so<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.600> first<00:01:01.020> way<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.070> wear<00:01:02.219> scarves

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
so the first way I like to wear scarves

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.509 
so the first way I like to wear scarves
is<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.629> take<00:01:03.930> your<00:01:04.140> scarf<00:01:04.470> and<00:01:04.739> fold<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.339> in

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
is to take your scarf and fold it in

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.380 
is to take your scarf and fold it in
half<00:01:05.549> like<00:01:06.360> this<00:01:07.100> so<00:01:08.100> that<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> ends<00:01:09.119> are<00:01:09.180> just

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
half like this so that the ends are just

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.490 
half like this so that the ends are just
right<00:01:09.540> there<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:09.840> you're<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.110> folding<00:01:10.409> it

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
right there and you're just folding it

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.109 
right there and you're just folding it
in<00:01:10.650> half<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.189> then<00:01:11.549> what<00:01:11.670> you're<00:01:11.790> do<00:01:11.970> is

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119
