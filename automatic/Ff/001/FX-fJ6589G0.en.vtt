Wigglytuff<00:02:41.410> I'm<00:02:41.530> hoping<00:02:41.770> this<00:02:41.860> hydro<00:02:42.130> pump

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
Wigglytuff I'm hoping this hydro pump

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.200 
Wigglytuff I'm hoping this hydro pump
does<00:02:43.080> I'm<00:02:44.080> hoping<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:45.060> combination<00:02:46.060> of<00:02:46.090> these

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
does I'm hoping a combination of these

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:51.300 
does I'm hoping a combination of these
two<00:02:46.270> are<00:02:46.510> going<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.690> do<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:49.140> scary<00:02:50.140> do<00:02:50.800> not<00:02:51.010> like

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
two are going to do it scary do not like

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:59.040 
two are going to do it scary do not like
oh<00:02:51.640> come<00:02:52.600> on<00:02:52.780> oh<00:02:53.430> Jesus<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:58.150> is<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.900> worst

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 
oh come on oh Jesus this is the worst

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.520 
oh come on oh Jesus this is the worst
day<00:02:59.260> ever<00:03:03.150> well<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.450> guess<00:03:04.870> that<00:03:04.900> doubling<00:03:05.350> into

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
day ever well I guess that doubling into

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:06.630 
day ever well I guess that doubling into
Wigglytuff<00:03:05.920> is<00:03:06.070> not<00:03:06.250> going<00:03:06.400> to<00:03:06.460> matter

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
Wigglytuff is not going to matter

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.590 
Wigglytuff is not going to matter
because<00:03:07.500> my<00:03:08.500> Rotom<00:03:08.830> doesn't<00:03:09.130> exist<00:03:09.430> he<00:03:10.420> got

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
because my Rotom doesn't exist he got

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:17.740 
because my Rotom doesn't exist he got
high<00:03:10.750> jump<00:03:11.020> kicked<00:03:11.200> into<00:03:11.380> oblivion
