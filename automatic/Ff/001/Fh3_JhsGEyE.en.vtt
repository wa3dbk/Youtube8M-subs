00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.490
 At the moment there is a very special competition around the world 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:10.209
 small 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:15.299
 Participants travel 80 days 30 thousand kilometers 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.699
 and that almost the famous novel by Schill Bernd 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:22.160
 with new emissions and only with solar or wind energy 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.050
 There is also a Swiss team with their futuristic electric vehicle 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:30.029
 in no form 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.149
 this is the eighth Suso Richter an electrically powered cab 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:35.050
 motorcycle 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.050
 that includes electric vehicle of the world with a powerful 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.760
 Electric drive can be the Hero 2 Saint Pierre Coffin seconds from 0 to 100 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.190
 accelerate and in the test even with a Porsche 911 gt2 measure 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.290
 In this workshop on the edge of the tour built the two young entrepreneurs 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.290
 Tobias Wülser and Frank Loacker within six months because they red 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.340
 white Ahlen 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.210
 it consists of almost 100 percent Swiss components, we hope to see here 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.330
 clearly to the components of our electric vehicle 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.960
 the relief curiosity electric motor that is a nonsense Comodo specifically 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.910
 developed for electric vehicles 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:19.470
 the poster with this cooling system kills their meeting place if this 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.600
 Fair was head of the engine loses the CDU from the black box 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.940
 that is exaggerated the heart 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.900
 consists 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.440
 375 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.750
 builds from these individual cases no to the old post office 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.050
 can we new public Enemy 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.990
 that the long way for us 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.459
 The motorcycles are actually equipped with an internal combustion engine 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.240
 Tobias Wülser always wanted to electrify his model 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.410
 Dobel been taken - or it put in witness here 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.890
 very bad design bunch 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.460
 and I've been thinking how can I as an industrial designer answer his 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.630
 House is better is even faster 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.220
 and there too little passion has come to this the Blohm work 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.009
 In a nutshell, it is ensured that here a long line has the binding 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.029
 to the total trend 

00:02:13.029 --> 00:02:16.589
 it's about breaking the role of body openings in the stern area 

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:20.919
 so also in the east of the new law initiated urge due to the high 

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:23.739
 Honoring dynamic efficiency achieves that original 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.439
 Speeds of 250 km / h 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:30.159
 and with up to 52 degrees cushions can tilt with motorcycles 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.189
 informed 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:34.769
 However, steering differs a lot from the classic motorcycle 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.810
 we do not need to fit a helmet do not worry leather suit where I sweat 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.879
 Zhu privatized 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.760
 this revolt is the only way to explain the style 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.950
 Regulation for the stability of the vehicle at slow 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:50.309
 speeds 

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:52.559
 that is the Gau designed 

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:55.889
 the MIG 240 without looking 

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:58.889
 Engage gears 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.129
 the project cost 220000 euros so far 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.289
 With the futuristic vehicle, the two now have big plans 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:12.809
 once around the world in 80 days and this exclusively with electricity 

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:17.489
 the amount of energy that Herod's way for the world circumnavigation needs picture in 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.609
 Switzerland Timo Boll is produced by a test facility with 200 solar panels 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.139
 the frustrated ones 

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.909
 The vehicle needed around 2400 kilowatt hours Dietz left in this 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.679
 to turn up this brazen attempt to bring Hilo Meter over with it 

00:03:35.679 --> 00:03:40.789
 is the AIT word will be annual consumption of a 2 persons apartment 

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:45.619
 I think that's going to be the goal of the race itself by the project team 

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:49.319
 Virtually we're on a console from what we point out earlier 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.029
 Solar energy today already exploits that there is no economy 

00:03:53.029 --> 00:03:56.489
 science fiction value the technology has been there 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.279
 the vehicle started to charge the battery over a normal one 

00:04:00.279 --> 00:04:01.629
 socket 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:05.439
 Therefore they take different adapters with us on the world trip 

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:08.599
 prepared to become also in the storm places in the world 

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:13.749
 m the club hopes it is still bird species because we can this 200 to 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:17.239
 Of course, 300 kilometers ahead, we have to see every outlet where we are 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.299
 but there are fortunately many more outlets from gas stations on 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.840
 this world 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.520
 the last organizational preparations for the journey are underway 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.360
 full swing 

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.120
 because 16 countries go through the Hero Tracer team and advocates always 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.840
 a children's dream of teachers chose a homemade electric vehicle 

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.340
 been 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.120
 back to dad is due to its maximum speed of 320 grams 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.319
 Bunnies of the industry 

00:04:42.319 --> 00:04:44.869
 When co2 it is the maximum speed due to the 

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:48.969
 Electric motor limited to 250 may be that they calm Emperor though 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:53.389
 accelerate faster he is unbeatable consumption 8 kilowatts per 100 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.810
 Kilometers equals 0 Comarch Dieter Gasoline 16 times less than one 

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:58.610
 Porsche 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.039
 With the world tour as the team now prove the end customer business 

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.719
 Drive concept can be an alternative
