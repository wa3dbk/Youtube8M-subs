00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:07.380
 how to cool beer 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.480
 it is necessary supposedly it can be done 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.309
 otherwise the internet is full of 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.880
 spectacular methods to cool 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:17.380
 beer 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:19.270
 other methods really work here 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.950
 it did not happen to forget to put the 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.980
 beers in the refrigerator on a day of 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:26.700
 heat nothing are hot we are going to 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:29.560
 create them in the refrigerator or freezer 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.140
 they take too long the perfect temperature 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.730
 a beer is just 8 degrees the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.850
 temperatures of baby beers 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.950
 Dianita is 26 degrees very will see daughter 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:43.170
 cool them in the member lake more with 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.670
 a temperature of 24 degrees this water 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.670
 it's as hot as beer 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.630
 you have to cool the beer quickly 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.329
 it should not last more than 5 minutes 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.309
 Baby Dianita have accepted the challenge 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.199
 new ideas arrive and depart 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:03.550
 internet and the truth is that there is a 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.440
 lots but they really work 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.180
 of life found in the garage a 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.970
 old the carbon dioxide sector 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.310
 inside the extinguisher dioxide 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.659
 of carbon at great price the mixture that 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.400
 comes out is due to the 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:17.050
 pressure compensation in which the 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.150
 liquid is transformed into gas that comes out 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.070
 by the mouthpiece at about 70 degrees under 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:23.020
 zero 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.590
 well I'm a little afraid that the 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.450
 bottle breaks but on the other hand 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:34.180
 I'm intrigued 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.180
 baby has never used a success 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:52.020
 the cold is clearly seen 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.299
 the carbon dioxide freezes in 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.079
 dry ice but it was enough to 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.390
 cool it 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:01.610
 I do not know, it's not cold 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.610
 it seems to you that we do not see each other 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.450
 carbon dioxide has evaporated 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.770
 the air too fast the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.229
 Beer temperatures still 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.760
 being 10 degrees too hot the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.250
 extinguisher not always to cool and 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.050
 also the method is polluting the idea 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.970
 It sounds great like ice cubes 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.680
 I do in beer if they are inside the 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.130
 glass is easier to place in a 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:25.200
 strainer on the glass of the beginning with 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.270
 the large colander and the many cubes 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.990
 beer has a lot of space to 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.990
 distribute 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.350
 Every drop of water comes into contact with 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.120
 total guarantee as the cold and halo and for 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.420
 say it somehow cools 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:42.420
 very much you just have to try 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.190
 that does not go by gas with this method 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.870
 It should last less than 10 seconds 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.220
 supposes that with that it is enough to leave gas 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.220
 enough in beer 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.310
 and the temperature 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.250
 8 degrees ideal to strain the beer with the 

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.109
 ice really works however not 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.719
 it only takes the heat away from the beer but 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:10.569
 also the taste even with just colar 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:12.819
 once only is insipid 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.799
 anita dad his shirt in water and 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.920
 then wrap the bottle with it 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:16.920
 beer 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:22.599
 the idea 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.790
 the trip by car the water of the shirt 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.610
 of anita will evaporate with the wind and 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.410
 so the bottle should be cooled 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.740
 at a level holding the bottle outside of 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.810
 the open window 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:35.540
 so that enough water evaporates 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.340
 is helped with a vaporizer this is 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.170
 made a principle very similar to 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.000
 refrigerator since this supposedly 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.570
 It also works with cold 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.570
 evaporation 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.080
 It's time to know if this method works 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.430
 and after a few minutes on the street 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.430
 you have to take the temperature 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.000
 24 degrees the truth is that it has not 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.180
 changed nothing 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.710
 only two degrees colder and with this 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.710
 method also pollutes the air 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.940
 this life seems crazy declared only 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.650
 can be found on the internet with a 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.150
 grill and a gas container 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:21.979
 camping davis starts up 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:24.050
 this seems to me is a bit 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.759
 risky ropes where have you sought support 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.900
 professional on the phone with the 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:28.900
 fire Department 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.190
 shortly after arriving firefighters seems 

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.270
 that the experiment is dangerous 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:38.270
 after all 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.310
 and prepare the grill your idea to bury 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:47.930
 Two bottles of beer between two layers 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.500
 of sand and listen to what they will do 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:50.500
 working 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.940
 will light a fire on the surface 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:58.920
 of the sparkling sand and a lighter 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.560
 start to burn the flames the fire 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.289
 you will need energy this energy 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:06.180
 will come from the heat of the environment more 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.919
 this is from beer bottles 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.809
 also what we want to take care of is 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.479
 say at least this is what you should 

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:14.309
 I care theoretically occur only under 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:16.110
 the monitoring of firefighters is possible 

00:05:14.309 --> 00:05:20.419
 perform a dangerous experiment like 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.419
 This is not recommended to do 

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.240
 after showering in alcohol you have to 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.550
 place the lid of the grill and 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.490
 introduce the gas that is highly 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:33.490
 flammable just like a bar dares 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:37.080
 the fireman to light the fire the gas will 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.080
 it burns in the air in a second 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.280
 fire spreads through the sand in the 

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:45.410
 plain partridge but I had the yes with the 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.860
 try the thermometer do not teach anything 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:47.860
 striking 

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:52.439
 suddenly the first bottle explodes 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.759
 the bottle 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.920
 and soon the thermometer does not rise either 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.660
 all right 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.850
 but the second one will have cooled 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:08.450
 bottle the fireman authorizes us to 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.450
 check it 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.840
 two 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.240
 the temperature of the bottle is double 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.420
 before the experiment has not gone 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.420
 all right 

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.830
 the test should not be done only under 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:30.710
 no circumstance could end 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:33.249
 wrong and end up with a thousand pieces of bottle 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:37.269
 everywhere 

00:06:33.249 --> 00:06:40.179
 maybe some wound cool beer with 

00:06:37.269 --> 00:06:42.279
 fire alone in the laboratory the ice 

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:43.989
 it's cold that anyone knows but 

00:06:42.279 --> 00:06:46.509
 you can really cool the bottle in 

00:06:43.989 --> 00:06:47.919
 warm water in record time peter me 

00:06:46.509 --> 00:06:49.779
 says yes 

00:06:47.919 --> 00:06:51.639
 baby dianita fills in each one a 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:53.820
 fountain with ice and filled with water 

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:57.440
 temperate lake 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.440
 I just need beer 

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:02.430
 in very little time the water in both 

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.520
 sources has dropped to 5 degrees 

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:07.260
 now we have to wait for water 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.090
 freezing is better than the freezer or 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.980
 ice cubes just that this is 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.590
 cools the beer only where they enter 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:15.540
 direct contact with the bottle the water 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:18.460
 frost completely covers the surface 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:20.680
 outside of the bottle 

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:23.100
 but beer is already cold in the 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:23.100
 bottle 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:34.259
 indeed the beer is nine o'clock 

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:34.259
 ten degrees 

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.480
 step of hot cold in just 5 

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.960
 minutes 

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:44.440
 iced water the undisputed winner of 

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.440
 the test 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:51.500
 Both work both have earned 

00:07:48.319 --> 00:07:54.020
 honestly a beer to discover 

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:57.039
 the best method to cool them so 

00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.039
 for now health 

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.200
 did you know that the brahma beer that 

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:08.970
 elaborate in sao paulo brasil is the brand 

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.290
 of best- selling beer in the hemisphere 

00:08:08.970 --> 00:08:12.290
 north out of the usa
