00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 Jim and Supermarket for those in you 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.879
 does not see it already 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.140
 could centromer what happened what 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.820
 what impact will happen 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.860
 it for you what impact it on 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.210
 my content than my channel to be 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.139
 a few things that I include here other 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.389
 are going to tell 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.190
 well what did he do they already had 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.750
 announced an update that was already one 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.250
 few pacing things reported they wanted 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.359
 compare price improved and for the rest 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.670
 were it mostly 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.740
 head to head tanker you notifications but they 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.449
 also report a huge 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.250
 update nobody knew what it was customs 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.769
 speculation peet understands a video made 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.149
 as to what the price ranges are in other words 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.280
 price necklace 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.160
 what this means is that it happens 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.760
 phenomenon price range hence the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.379
 title and what it means is normal 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.180
 spoken if you wanted to buy coins then 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.559
 is that you for example 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.300
 Just appoint Lucian to Singapore 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.050
 imagine the average value of 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.079
 mostly 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.550
 600 650 maybe 700 but what are you with 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.960
 buy coins usually did that is hack or 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.690
 for example 10 million 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.309
 so a starting price 150 if yes lister 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.250
 narsingh for 10 million 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.809
 and that was it but now with price range 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.280
 is so fixed at narsingh one 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.110
 certain value you can have it 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.710
 for example maxi minimalists following 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.960
 50 and you can know a maximum of 750 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.780
 well how effective this coins buy that 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.960
 simply means that coins actually buy 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:21.030
 it's gone it doesn't milk us that 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.869
 is practically impossible because what it is now 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.939
 is 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.220
 is every player has a minimum and 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.790
 maximum marvel so for means if 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.009
 arco comes 310 k to 470 can go all 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.030
 carrier between you can the me areas as 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.070
 you want 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.869
 but nothing else changes so yes you 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.420
 can say but cannot go under in 310 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.340
 we also can't go above 370 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.200
 the is a certain amount that you commit to 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.759
 must keep and that makes buying coins 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.530
 impossible if you are two million now 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.659
 would like to buy food then you have to 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.390
 someone dear to say whether a 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:54.180
 can have a value of two million or 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.470
 for example, you need 100 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.350
 players knew that worth 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.909
 20k 4 is about doing that I think so 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.869
 not and it is also impossible for sites 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.450
 because a seagram that thousands thousands 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.069
 offerings per day just can't 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.800
 keep that pace going him 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.209
 just don't be and i have to say it 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.319
 city ​​for once 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.629
 which you can sleep 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.319
 it is since i of 13 really busy with 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.799
 quorn sellers 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.499
 and he never really tackled it 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:24.269
 but what it is now is that has just 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:25.950
 said ok this is how we are going to do it 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.719
 and it's a strong way to handle it 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.209
 now it sounds like i'm one 

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.099
 'm very positive about and that will be a 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:35.370
 explain a little 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:37.349
 i see you as not as youtuber as it 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.319
 player as a casual point player 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.090
 I don't see the good in it 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.799
 timing of the timing of it is terrible 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.989
 for they have done it with fastened 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:46.560
 the prices loedeman at the moment is up 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.879
 xbox 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.129
 with the result that I have a playstation 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.120
 have nothing left because everything is much lower 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.949
 in price 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.389
 so everything is gone and mode almost gone 

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:56.159
 loppersum and road missions and almost gone 

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.629
 and on xbox 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.219
 you don't lose paving stones 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:01.620
 what you have so you make a lot of losses 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:03.449
 which mainly bought us shot in 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.859
 so that's a problem but if they have this 

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:07.590
 name wonam early this year 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.930
 done or some start of fifa 16 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.540
 then this would have been a great concept 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:14.219
 and reason for that is just because you then 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.230
 fixed price will therefore not state aldo 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.090
 because the whole pity 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.729
 a maximum of, for example, a million 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.799
 and if they are then Allah Fever 12 one 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.669
 a bit decent had a match rewards 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:26.189
 done 

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:28.919
 good tournament bonuses and the game is 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.659
 fun to play then hands people that 

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:32.099
 well because I remember in fifa 12 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.419
 indeed I call that again as 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.939
 example because that was a good one 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:37.439
 example in terms of prices as well as the prices 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:40.049
 established tons of heavy then 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:42.449
 not stuck otherwise the and were low 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.370
 decent rewards were reasonable then 

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.540
 you could start with hits and buy for 75 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.919
 about a year 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.540
 then you have to work hard for it with you 

00:03:46.919 --> 00:03:50.909
 buy coffee joyce but it was it 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.099
 worth it and if so in fifa 6 that too 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:55.409
 is the case with the fixed price 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.699
 from for example messi for then will 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:57.780
 less all the may be over 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.799
 maybe it immediately throws one 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.479
 million 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.150
 if you are just a bit more playful messi 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:04.439
 you may be trying to act 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.060
 as far as that is possible quite a bit 

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:08.219
 minimum and maximum prices of course 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.569
 for them that became the admission there are 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:11.909
 decent options 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.889
 and besides if you just don't like it 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.900
 will fit current situation 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:17.609
 addressing fifa point price we have to address them 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.519
 own piece popular to pick up can now 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.150
 your 100 euros 12,000 type points 12,000 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.060
 fifa coins 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.169
 gives you 80 packages let it go 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.950
 sink in 

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:28.140
 80 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.450
 hats I don't know if you realize 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.120
 how little that is but that's just you 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:35.850
 that it is 100 euros over 80 packs 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.700
 100 euros or yes at the moment with extreme 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:41.190
 high point that just gave you 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.660
 30 million I think maybe a little less 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.220
 but really we have that over 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.290
 fifteen mille 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.360
 now that just can't say the idea of 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:50.790
 the casual shirt player is in it 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.100
 advantage because what it is now 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.350
 is you are just you had fair play 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.480
 and thereby you go and earn it 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.850
 5 is you must be at least something from 7000 

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.110
 playing games you get better at them 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.850
 all of them 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:05.310
 and then you might buy ronaldo 

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:07.590
 maybe if you are happy and that is 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:10.290
 just that is a problem that problem 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.520
 probably hadn't been addressed 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.130
 and i don't know what we are doing now 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.140
 probably fifa 15 is the ultimate team 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:17.730
 we reasonably killed the city by someone 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.200
 someone who now starts with god who just got the 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:20.700
 copy of the game 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.620
 you are going to determine what that cannot many 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.600
 with the heroes that he wants to play with 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.820
 unless you are a premier division of venice 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.780
 a man might be, but you understand where 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.060
 I want to go 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.380
 for the cherries whether it is player we are 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.850
 divorce most players priceless 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:35.130
 unless you also bought in coins and 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:36.600
 hopefully a reasonable amount and 

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:38.670
 making you still quite a bit 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.980
 players can enjoy and enjoy 

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.090
 what does this mean to me is something 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:43.770
 probably even though they will be asking 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.330
 after my change comes not very 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.400
 I can pack perfection for quite a long time 

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:49.170
 persevere then little to nothing more 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.000
 going on I would higher the le 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:54.240
 rules Nietzsche's jersey slightly less 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.970
 will pack quickly and additionally mission mark 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.230
 place that is totally not turquoise or fifa 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:00.360
 coins affected 

00:05:58.230 --> 00:06:01.890
 I'll just continue with it then it will be 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.570
 Also for you is red is you get something 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.700
 more legitimacy you can pack this number 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.470
 you can't give yourself coins together 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.850
 so I'm curious how it goes 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:11.280
 in it will be an interesting development 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:13.200
 become in terms of youtube and far from we fun 

00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.000
 Creative series can still do it 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.860
 is just how you fill it in yourself and that 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.990
 is going to take a lot from you 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:20.190
 admit out really cunt of your terms 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.570
 timing had said it before and before 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.680
 some youtubers 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:24.600
 It is also just part of their income 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:27.120
 limited now because didn't start what 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.500
 lots of king leather content what i am 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.530
 a total problem because I like to think 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.300
 the king past things but now is the 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:34.710
 problem that some are very angry 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.640
 because part of their income go 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.960
 to miss 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.440
 and for some it just takes a big one 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.520
 part of the content 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.030
 and I sincerely regret it 

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.170
 some and i yes i don't know i am there 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.570
 a bit surprised by myself 

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:48.910
 but i think if you just now 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:51.160
 try to do something for yourself 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.290
 just keep it simple 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.030
 don't go crazy for the market don't go 

00:06:53.290 --> 00:06:57.250
 claim that your plague finds some plague better 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:59.050
 is still a shit game 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.700
 just try to make the best of it 

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:02.200
 just try to play what is trying 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:02.830
 discover how the game could be fun for you 

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.150
 to be 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:05.140
 maybe you don't need all of them 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:07.150
 I can tell you from experience 

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:09.070
 top-heavy has not been clear to me 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.600
 enjoy budget fifa more 

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.830
 anyway that's what i kind of like 

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.790
 the lost wanted for my changes there 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:13.810
 nothing 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.250
 you can just try the best 

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:16.780
 out of it 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:18.190
 and hopefully fix that unfortunately around you 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:22.620
 thoughts about this in the comments 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:22.620
