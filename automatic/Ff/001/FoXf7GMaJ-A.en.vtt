00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
course a8 last games was really hard

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.120 
course a8 last games was really hard
specially<00:02:20.930> because<00:02:21.080> we<00:02:21.380> didn't<00:02:21.650> have<00:02:21.680> any

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
specially because we didn't have any

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.610 
specially because we didn't have any
like<00:02:22.580> those<00:02:22.970> were<00:02:23.180> kind<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.540> exhibition<00:02:24.380> games

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
like those were kind of exhibition games

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.760 
like those were kind of exhibition games
for<00:02:24.920> us<00:02:25.420> because<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:26.750> know<00:02:26.900> that<00:02:26.930> even<00:02:27.440> we

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
for us because we know that even we

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:29.890 
for us because we know that even we
would<00:02:27.950> won<00:02:28.460> all<00:02:28.730> the<00:02:28.880> games<00:02:28.910> we<00:02:29.480> didn't<00:02:29.750> make

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:29.900 
would won all the games we didn't make

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:33.790 
would won all the games we didn't make
it<00:02:29.960> to<00:02:30.350> top<00:02:30.770> 10<00:02:31.070> so<00:02:32.020> that's<00:02:33.020> that's<00:02:33.530> always

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:33.800 
it to top 10 so that's that's always

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.710 
it to top 10 so that's that's always
it's<00:02:34.250> not<00:02:34.310> fun<00:02:34.730> to<00:02:34.760> play<00:02:35.090> if<00:02:35.270> you<00:02:35.390> don't<00:02:35.570> have

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
it's not fun to play if you don't have

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.560 
it's not fun to play if you don't have
anything<00:02:36.050> any<00:02:36.560> goals<00:02:37.100> there<00:02:37.430> what<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:38.150> can<00:02:38.360> of

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
anything any goals there what you can of

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.290 
anything any goals there what you can of
course<00:02:38.660> you<00:02:38.990> have<00:02:39.140> to<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:40.520> can<00:02:40.670> improve<00:02:41.030> your

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
course you have to you can improve your

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.830 
course you have to you can improve your
your<00:02:41.870> team<00:02:42.260> game<00:02:42.560> there<00:02:42.800> and<00:02:43.420> do<00:02:44.420> some<00:02:44.660> little

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
your team game there and do some little

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.060 
your team game there and do some little
changes<00:02:45.170> but<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:46.810> think<00:02:47.810> that's<00:02:48.200> that's<00:02:48.680> pretty

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.070 
changes but I think that's that's pretty

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.180 
changes but I think that's that's pretty
pretty<00:02:49.790> hard<00:02:50.120> to<00:02:50.270> play<00:02:50.480> but<00:02:50.990> now<00:02:51.230> 10<00:02:51.620> games<00:02:51.860> are

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
pretty hard to play but now 10 games are

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.850 
pretty hard to play but now 10 games are
coming<00:02:52.550> up<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.910> are<00:02:53.090> really<00:02:53.960> important<00:02:54.470> and

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
coming up that are really important and

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.790 
coming up that are really important and
them<00:02:55.540> should<00:02:56.540> be<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.840> your<00:02:57.020> motivation<00:02:57.290> done

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800
