a<00:00:26.900> online<00:00:27.900> um<00:00:29.359> roster<00:00:30.359> so<00:00:30.720> we're<00:00:31.080> going<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.470> use

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
a online um roster so we're going to use

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.590 
a online um roster so we're going to use
the<00:00:31.800> online<00:00:31.949> master<00:00:32.550> just<00:00:32.790> because<00:00:33.120> it<00:00:33.420> makes

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the online master just because it makes

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.770 
the online master just because it makes
the<00:00:33.780> most<00:00:33.930> sense<00:00:34.020> most<00:00:34.829> updated<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.690> don't<00:00:36.690> know

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
the most sense most updated I don't know

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.229 
the most sense most updated I don't know
what<00:00:37.260> trades<00:00:38.129> went<00:00:38.520> on<00:00:38.610> during<00:00:38.850> spring

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239

training<00:00:39.270> that<00:00:39.840> we're<00:00:40.020> definitely

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
training that we're definitely

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.200 
training that we're definitely
significant<00:00:41.040> but<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.460> least<00:00:41.640> they<00:00:41.940> will

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
significant but at least they will

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.080 
significant but at least they will
reflect<00:00:42.989> in<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.379> game<00:00:43.620> so<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.370> are<00:00:44.520> going<00:00:44.789> to

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
reflect in this game so we are going to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.930 
reflect in this game so we are going to
make<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.510> closing<00:00:46.320> pitcher<00:00:46.739> very<00:00:47.550> excited

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
make a closing pitcher very excited

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.100 
make a closing pitcher very excited
about<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.149> closing<00:00:48.660> pitchers<00:00:48.989> are

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
about that closing pitchers are

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.360 
about that closing pitchers are
definitely<00:00:49.469> really<00:00:49.649> cool<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:50.070> you<00:00:50.250> never

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
definitely really cool because you never

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.459 
definitely really cool because you never
know<00:00:50.520> when<00:00:50.940> your<00:00:51.120> next<00:00:51.149> game<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:52.020> going<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.350> be

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
know when your next game is going to be

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.130 
know when your next game is going to be
just<00:00:53.460> sim<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.030> hope<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.420> play<00:00:54.629> within<00:00:54.930> the

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
week or else you'll be a little rusty so

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.430

if<00:00:58.699> anybody<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.760> watched<00:01:00.090> my<00:01:00.420> previous<00:01:00.899> series

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
if anybody is watched my previous series

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680 
if anybody is watched my previous series
I<00:01:01.590> said<00:01:02.070> power<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.550> more<00:01:03.270> important<00:01:03.660> than

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
I said power was more important than

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.830 
I said power was more important than
stamina<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:05.100> continues<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.909> be<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.299> you

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
stamina and it continues to be so you

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.590 
stamina and it continues to be so you
will<00:01:06.990> see<00:01:07.200> in<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:07.920> little<00:01:08.070> bit<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.700> when<00:01:09.270> you

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
will see in a little bit that when you

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.000 
will see in a little bit that when you
put<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.900> power<00:01:10.110> all<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.409> way<00:01:10.500> up<00:01:10.710> for<00:01:10.950> a

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
put the power all the way up for a

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.950 
put the power all the way up for a
closing<00:01:11.640> pitcher<00:01:11.790> your<00:01:12.060> stamina<00:01:12.330> starts<00:01:12.810> out

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
closing pitcher your stamina starts out

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.140 
closing pitcher your stamina starts out
with<00:01:13.110> only<00:01:13.320> five<00:01:13.710> points<00:01:14.010> which<00:01:14.670> might<00:01:14.909> seem

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
with only five points which might seem

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.300 
with only five points which might seem
really<00:01:15.420> bad<00:01:15.600> but<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:16.049> doesn't<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:16.830> affect

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
really bad but it doesn't really affect

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.450 
really bad but it doesn't really affect
the<00:01:17.369> pitcher<00:01:17.759> too<00:01:17.939> much<00:01:18.710> because<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.920> stat<00:01:20.189> is

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
the pitcher too much because the stat is

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.520 
the pitcher too much because the stat is
so<00:01:20.670> low<00:01:20.939> so<00:01:21.270> little<00:01:21.810> training<00:01:22.140> points<00:01:22.290> are

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
so low so little training points are

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.469 
so low so little training points are
needed<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.979> boost<00:01:23.159> up<00:01:23.520> each<00:01:23.880> level<00:01:24.479> whereas<00:01:25.290> a

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
needed to boost up each level whereas a

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.130 
needed to boost up each level whereas a
significant<00:01:27.479> amount<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.750> training<00:01:27.930> points

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
significant amount of training points

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.200 
significant amount of training points
will<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.439> needed<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:29.070> increase<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.909> velocity

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
will be needed to increase the velocity

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.700 
will be needed to increase the velocity
of<00:01:30.630> each<00:01:30.960> pitch<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:32.659> adequate<00:01:33.659> level<00:01:34.470> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
of each pitch to a adequate level and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.190 
of each pitch to a adequate level and
also<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:35.130> boost<00:01:35.700> your<00:01:35.939> home<00:01:36.540> run<00:01:36.780> per<00:01:36.990> nine

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
also to boost your home run per nine

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.190 
also to boost your home run per nine
innings<00:01:37.229> that<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.369> it's<00:01:38.759> really<00:01:39.170> important<00:01:40.170> to

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
innings that so it's really important to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.569 
innings that so it's really important to
make<00:01:40.590> sure<00:01:40.619> you're<00:01:40.890> not<00:01:40.979> getting<00:01:41.220> home<00:01:41.400> runs

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
make sure you're not getting home runs

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.700 
make sure you're not getting home runs
hit<00:01:41.790> off<00:01:41.909> of<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.240> stamina<00:01:42.990> can<00:01:43.409> wait

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
hit off of you and stamina can wait

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.200 
hit off of you and stamina can wait
until<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.220> have<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.490> extra<00:01:44.700> training<00:01:45.000> plan

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
until you have the extra training plan

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.999 
until you have the extra training plan
to<00:01:45.360> put<00:01:45.509> into<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.380> as<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.710> can<00:01:46.829> see<00:01:46.979> our

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
to put into it so as you can see our

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.069 
to put into it so as you can see our
three<00:01:47.549> starting<00:01:47.880> pitches<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.390> four<00:01:48.780> seamer

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
three starting pitches are four seamer

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.440 
three starting pitches are four seamer
cutter<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.680> sweeping<00:01:50.250> curve<00:01:50.549> definitely

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
cutter and sweeping curve definitely

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.149 
cutter and sweeping curve definitely
something<00:01:51.750> I<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:51.930> not<00:01:52.079> used<00:01:52.259> before<00:01:52.500> but<00:01:52.710> it

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
something I have not used before but it

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.240 
something I have not used before but it
should<00:01:53.430> be<00:01:53.460> pretty<00:01:54.270> interesting<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.530> after<00:01:55.920> we

out<00:04:06.080> this<00:04:06.800> is<00:04:07.370> definitely<00:04:07.610> new<00:04:07.940> protective

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
out this is definitely new protective

out this is definitely new protective
ventilated<00:04:09.650> um<00:04:10.489> or<00:04:11.390> basic<00:04:11.840> I<00:04:12.049> think

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 
ventilated um or basic I think

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.410 
ventilated um or basic I think
protective<00:04:13.160> is<00:04:13.310> probably<00:04:13.730> best<00:04:14.030> for<00:04:14.209> a

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
protective is probably best for a

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.219 
protective is probably best for a
pitcher<00:04:15.140> because<00:04:16.450> closing<00:04:17.450> pitcher<00:04:17.570> very

00:04:18.219 --> 00:04:18.229 
pitcher because closing pitcher very

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.890 
pitcher because closing pitcher very
doubtful<00:04:18.620> that<00:04:18.680> he<00:04:18.919> will<00:04:19.549> be<00:04:20.060> batting<00:04:20.299> anyway

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
doubtful that he will be batting anyway

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.469 
doubtful that he will be batting anyway
but<00:04:21.200> if<00:04:21.320> he<00:04:21.470> is<00:04:21.739> we<00:04:22.729> don't<00:04:22.940> want<00:04:23.180> him<00:04:23.330> getting

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:23.479 
but if he is we don't want him getting

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:24.850 
but if he is we don't want him getting
hit<00:04:23.750> in<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:23.870> head<00:04:24.110> because<00:04:24.290> he<00:04:24.530> probably

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
hit in the head because he probably

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.180 
hit in the head because he probably
doesn't<00:04:25.460> have<00:04:25.550> the<00:04:25.669> best<00:04:25.850> reflexes<00:04:26.950> so<00:04:27.950> give

why<00:05:02.930> you<00:05:02.990> would<00:05:03.110> need<00:05:03.229> a<00:05:03.350> compression<00:05:03.889> sleeve

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
why you would need a compression sleeve

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.610 
why you would need a compression sleeve
under<00:05:05.360> your<00:05:05.600> arm<00:05:05.750> of<00:05:05.870> a<00:05:05.960> pitcher<00:05:06.260> so<00:05:06.410> maybe

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
under your arm of a pitcher so maybe

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.680 
under your arm of a pitcher so maybe
it's<00:05:06.919> just<00:05:07.039> not<00:05:07.910> normal<00:05:08.060> for<00:05:08.270> a<00:05:08.419> pitcher<00:05:08.660> to

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:08.690 
it's just not normal for a pitcher to

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:11.370 
it's just not normal for a pitcher to
have<00:05:08.870> a<00:05:08.930> compression<00:05:09.740> sleeve<00:05:09.950> at<00:05:10.160> all<00:05:10.340> and

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:11.380 
have a compression sleeve at all and

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:15.820 
have a compression sleeve at all and
speeding<00:05:12.380> this<00:05:12.530> up<00:05:12.590> um<00:05:13.930> you<00:05:14.930> will<00:05:15.080> see<00:05:15.350> that

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
speeding this up um you will see that

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.469 
speeding this up um you will see that
they<00:05:16.610> gave<00:05:16.910> us<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.660> generic<00:05:18.620> stretch<00:05:19.690> set<00:05:20.690> of<00:05:20.930> ah

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
pitch out of the stretch so really nice

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.969 
pitch out of the stretch so really nice
for<00:05:29.510> players<00:05:30.050> who<00:05:30.200> want<00:05:30.410> to<00:05:30.530> play<00:05:30.620> closing

for players who want to play closing

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
about which one looks most realistic to

about which one looks most realistic to
a<00:05:39.950> closing<00:05:40.370> pitcher<00:05:40.490> and<00:05:41.419> then<00:05:41.599> this<00:05:41.870> is<00:05:41.930> also

a closing pitcher and then this is also

a closing pitcher and then this is also

know normally I would let you viewers to
see<00:05:45.770> it<00:05:45.889> but<00:05:46.130> it's<00:05:46.190> just<00:05:46.700> so<00:05:47.389> tedious<00:05:47.900> when<00:05:48.889> I'm

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:49.190 
see it but it's just so tedious when I'm

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.770 
see it but it's just so tedious when I'm
going<00:05:49.400> through<00:05:49.520> it<00:05:49.820> because<00:05:49.940> it<00:05:50.270> takes<00:05:50.450> me<00:05:50.630> so

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:50.780 
going through it because it takes me so

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.450 
going through it because it takes me so
long<00:05:50.810> to<00:05:51.200> honestly<00:05:51.590> figure<00:05:52.039> out<00:05:52.190> what<00:05:52.370> the

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:52.460 
long to honestly figure out what the

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.649 
long to honestly figure out what the
differences<00:05:52.910> I<00:05:53.150> was<00:05:53.270> trying<00:05:53.450> to<00:05:53.510> go<00:05:53.599> through

00:05:53.649 --> 00:05:53.659 
differences I was trying to go through

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:55.690 
differences I was trying to go through
it<00:05:53.840> fast<00:05:54.080> but<00:05:54.289> just<00:05:54.500> found<00:05:54.650> up<00:05:54.770> taking<00:05:55.099> so<00:05:55.669> long

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
it fast but just found up taking so long

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.190 
it fast but just found up taking so long
that<00:05:56.030> I<00:05:56.060> thought<00:05:56.270> you<00:05:56.419> could<00:05:56.570> probably<00:05:56.750> still

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
that I thought you could probably still

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.320 
that I thought you could probably still
get<00:05:57.349> the<00:05:57.530> same

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
get the same

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.510 
get the same
same<00:05:59.330> view<00:05:59.570> of<00:05:59.690> it<00:05:59.900> even<00:06:00.380> if<00:06:00.710> it<00:06:00.860> was<00:06:01.070> sped<00:06:01.340> up

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
same view of it even if it was sped up

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.540 
same view of it even if it was sped up
significantly<00:06:02.270> which<00:06:02.600> it<00:06:02.750> is<00:06:02.900> right<00:06:03.110> now<00:06:03.550> if

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
significantly which it is right now if

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:05.980 
significantly which it is right now if
it<00:06:04.760> really<00:06:04.940> bothers<00:06:05.000> you<00:06:05.390> that<00:06:05.420> this<00:06:05.660> part<00:06:05.900> is

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
it really bothers you that this part is

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.470 
it really bothers you that this part is
sped<00:06:06.170> up<00:06:06.200> I<00:06:06.500> can<00:06:06.830> upload<00:06:07.310> the<00:06:07.910> unedited

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 
sped up I can upload the unedited

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.600 
sped up I can upload the unedited
version<00:06:09.110> but<00:06:09.350> I<00:06:09.560> del<00:06:09.860> anybody's<00:06:10.400> going<00:06:10.520> to

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
version but I del anybody's going to

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.640 
version but I del anybody's going to
have<00:06:10.760> any<00:06:10.910> complaints<00:06:11.180> it<00:06:11.480> just<00:06:11.690> takes<00:06:12.200> me<00:06:12.350> so

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.650 
have any complaints it just takes me so

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:14.920 
have any complaints it just takes me so
long<00:06:12.680> it<00:06:13.610> is<00:06:13.940> a<00:06:13.970> really<00:06:14.270> cool<00:06:14.510> feature<00:06:14.630> though

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:14.930 
long it is a really cool feature though

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.020 
long it is a really cool feature though
it's<00:06:15.110> just<00:06:15.320> it<00:06:15.440> doesn't<00:06:15.650> necessarily<00:06:16.130> relate

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
it's just it doesn't necessarily relate

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.410 
it's just it doesn't necessarily relate
to<00:06:17.180> us<00:06:17.330> because<00:06:17.920> we<00:06:18.920> are<00:06:19.340> not<00:06:19.820> going<00:06:20.030> to<00:06:20.270> be

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 
to us because we are not going to be

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.290 
to us because we are not going to be
batting<00:06:20.990> at<00:06:21.260> all<00:06:21.620> unless<00:06:21.980> we're<00:06:22.760> in<00:06:23.000> an

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
batting at all unless we're in an

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.990 
batting at all unless we're in an
extremely<00:06:23.780> long<00:06:24.560> extra<00:06:25.280> inning<00:06:25.460> game<00:06:25.700> and

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 
extremely long extra inning game and

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.150 
extremely long extra inning game and
hopefully<00:06:26.810> that<00:06:27.140> does<00:06:27.260> not<00:06:27.380> happen<00:06:27.530> or<00:06:27.920> maybe

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:28.160 
hopefully that does not happen or maybe

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.970 
hopefully that does not happen or maybe
when<00:06:28.610> we<00:06:28.760> move<00:06:28.910> up<00:06:29.060> levels<00:06:29.420> we<00:06:29.660> might<00:06:29.980> be

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:30.980 
when we move up levels we might be

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:32.680 
when we move up levels we might be
batting<00:06:31.520> when<00:06:31.670> were<00:06:31.910> pitching<00:06:32.450> out<00:06:32.570> of<00:06:32.600> the

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
batting when were pitching out of the

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.290 
batting when were pitching out of the
bullpen<00:06:33.280> very<00:06:34.280> rare<00:06:34.610> that's<00:06:34.910> going<00:06:35.090> to<00:06:35.150> happen

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 
bullpen very rare that's going to happen

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.650 
bullpen very rare that's going to happen
so<00:06:36.290> we<00:06:37.040> wind<00:06:37.310> up<00:06:37.490> with<00:06:37.550> the<00:06:37.760> Baltimore<00:06:38.150> Orioles

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
so we wind up with the Baltimore Orioles

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.870 
so we wind up with the Baltimore Orioles
I'm<00:06:39.230> extremely<00:06:39.800> excited<00:06:40.040> about<00:06:40.610> those

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:40.880 
I'm extremely excited about those

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.630 
I'm extremely excited about those
closing<00:06:41.600> in<00:06:42.020> the<00:06:42.410> division<00:06:42.890> with<00:06:43.070> the<00:06:43.190> Yankees

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:43.640 
closing in the division with the Yankees

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.060 
closing in the division with the Yankees
and<00:06:44.000> the<00:06:44.660> Tampa<00:06:44.840> Bay<00:06:44.990> Rays<00:06:45.290> should<00:06:45.680> be<00:06:45.800> pretty

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
and the Tampa Bay Rays should be pretty

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:47.740 
and the Tampa Bay Rays should be pretty
fun<00:06:46.340> I've<00:06:46.580> never<00:06:46.850> played<00:06:47.120> on<00:06:47.210> the<00:06:47.450> Orioles

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:47.750 
fun I've never played on the Orioles

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:50.080 
fun I've never played on the Orioles
before<00:06:48.200> although<00:06:49.190> I<00:06:49.340> probably<00:06:49.610> shouldn't<00:06:50.030> be

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090 
before although I probably shouldn't be

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.490 
before although I probably shouldn't be
too<00:06:50.210> excited<00:06:50.660> we'll<00:06:50.810> probably<00:06:51.020> get<00:06:51.260> traded

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:51.500 
too excited we'll probably get traded

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.730 
too excited we'll probably get traded
before<00:06:51.770> we<00:06:52.010> make<00:06:52.220> it<00:06:52.250> to<00:06:52.370> the<00:06:52.520> majors<00:06:52.640> anyway

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
before we make it to the majors anyway

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.500 
before we make it to the majors anyway
so<00:06:54.740> the<00:06:54.980> next<00:06:55.160> episode<00:06:55.610> we<00:06:55.820> will<00:06:55.850> attempt<00:06:56.420> to

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:56.510

00:06:58.670 --> 00:07:00.850 
close quite a few games because closing
pitchers<00:06:59.000> take<00:06:59.240> so<00:06:59.690> short<00:06:59.960> a<00:07:00.050> time<00:07:00.230> to<00:07:00.680> play

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:00.860 
pitchers take so short a time to play

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.280 
pitchers take so short a time to play
