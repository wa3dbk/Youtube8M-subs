and the best way to cut an onion for me

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:58.609 
and the best way to cut an onion for me
is<00:01:29.480> to<00:01:29.770> slice<00:01:30.770> it<00:01:31.900> across<00:01:32.900> this<00:01:33.200> way

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.969 

the<00:01:59.619> next<00:01:59.920> one<00:02:00.070> is<00:02:00.100> my<00:02:00.520> green<00:02:00.759> bell<00:02:01.000> pepper

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979

the next one is my green bell pepper
there<00:02:02.979> are<00:02:03.070> different<00:02:03.340> ways<00:02:03.399> of<00:02:03.579> doing<00:02:03.820> this

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
there are different ways of doing this

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.760 
there are different ways of doing this
but<00:02:04.270> my<00:02:04.479> favorite<00:02:04.869> way<00:02:04.990> is<00:02:05.020> just<00:02:05.320> to<00:02:05.439> cut<00:02:05.500> off

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
but my favorite way is just to cut off

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.259 
but my favorite way is just to cut off
the<00:02:05.799> sides<00:02:07.440> because<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:08.800> want<00:02:09.039> to<00:02:09.130> avoid<00:02:09.429> the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
the sides because I want to avoid the

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:16.080 
the sides because I want to avoid the
seeds<00:02:10.690> in<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:10.989> middle<00:02:14.459> so<00:02:15.459> now<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.760> have<00:02:15.850> my

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
seeds in the middle so now I have my

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.960 
seeds in the middle so now I have my
little<00:02:16.269> seed<00:02:17.340> packet<00:02:18.340> I'm<00:02:18.489> just<00:02:18.580> going<00:02:18.850> to<00:02:18.910> put

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
little seed packet I'm just going to put

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:27.059 
little seed packet I'm just going to put
that<00:02:19.120> aside<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:24.010> take<00:02:24.489> my<00:02:24.700> long<00:02:24.910> pieces<00:02:26.069> cut
