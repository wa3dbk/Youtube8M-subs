00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.370 
in our square we then smooth it out to
draw<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.880> circle<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:40.410> you<00:02:40.470> feel<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.300> slide

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
draw the circle so you feel that slide

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:53.600 
draw the circle so you feel that slide
lift<00:02:43.430> slide<00:02:44.430> drop<00:02:45.230> slide<00:02:46.230> lift<00:02:47.160> slide<00:02:47.989> problem

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:57.420 

drop<00:02:54.610> so<00:02:55.450> you<00:02:55.510> see<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.200> it's<00:02:56.379> on<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:57.010> wall<00:02:57.220> in

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
drop so you see that it's on the wall in

lift and down and lift and down let's
try<00:03:10.750> to<00:03:10.840> go<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.140> other<00:03:11.230> way<00:03:11.319> so<00:03:11.849> explode

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
try to go the other way so explode
