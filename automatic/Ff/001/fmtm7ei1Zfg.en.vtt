showing<00:02:16.000> up<00:02:16.180> that's<00:02:16.360> a<00:02:16.510> good<00:02:16.540> sign<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:20.070> I'm

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
showing up that's a good sign and I'm

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.390 
showing up that's a good sign and I'm
already<00:02:21.190> starting<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.640> see<00:02:21.820> flakes<00:02:22.120> ago<00:02:23.400> I'll

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
already starting to see flakes ago I'll

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.470 
already starting to see flakes ago I'll
show<00:02:24.640> that<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.850> you<00:02:25.150> in<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.480> little<00:02:25.630> bit<00:02:25.840> let<00:02:26.200> me

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.490 

get<00:02:31.480> down<00:02:31.630> at<00:02:31.810> Withers

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.289 

less<00:02:35.500> material<00:02:38.519> so<00:02:39.519> everything<00:02:39.879> that's<00:02:40.000> left

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:40.299 
less material so everything that's left

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:41.369 
less material so everything that's left
in<00:02:40.480> there<00:02:40.659> I<00:02:40.689> don't<00:02:40.750> know<00:02:40.900> if<00:02:40.959> you<00:02:41.019> can<00:02:41.109> see

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
in there I don't know if you can see

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.789 
in there I don't know if you can see
that<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.709> glare<00:02:42.010> from<00:02:42.780> this<00:02:43.780> point<00:02:44.049> over<00:02:44.230> here

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
that the glare from this point over here

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.959 
that the glare from this point over here
that's<00:02:45.609> all<00:02:45.909> blacks<00:02:46.329> and<00:02:46.799> all<00:02:47.799> of<00:02:47.980> blacks<00:02:48.760> and

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:48.969 
that's all blacks and all of blacks and

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:51.869 
that's all blacks and all of blacks and
that<00:02:49.709> makes<00:02:50.709> it<00:02:50.859> tricky<00:02:51.250> so<00:02:51.459> it<00:02:51.579> makes<00:02:51.730> it<00:02:51.790> a

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:51.879 
that makes it tricky so it makes it a

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:53.699 
that makes it tricky so it makes it a
difficult<00:02:52.090> pan<00:02:52.599> because<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.930> can't<00:02:53.170> really<00:02:53.500> I

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
difficult pan because you can't really I

00:02:53.709 --> 00:03:01.250 
difficult pan because you can't really I
mean<00:02:54.219> you<00:02:54.340> can<00:02:54.609> but<00:02:54.969> it<00:02:55.209> takes<00:02:55.359> a<00:02:55.450> long<00:02:55.569> time

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.099 

tricky<00:03:02.260> to<00:03:02.349> separate<00:03:06.540> you<00:03:07.540> know<00:03:07.569> looking<00:03:07.959> at

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
tricky to separate you know looking at

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:09.330 
tricky to separate you know looking at
that<00:03:08.139> it<00:03:08.409> doesn't<00:03:08.709> look<00:03:08.769> like<00:03:08.829> there's<00:03:09.159> a<00:03:09.220> lot

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
that it doesn't look like there's a lot

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.780 
that it doesn't look like there's a lot
of<00:03:09.459> material<00:03:09.879> for<00:03:10.030> gold<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.359> be<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:11.579> a<00:03:14.700> lot<00:03:15.700> of

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
of material for gold to be in a lot of

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.339 
of material for gold to be in a lot of
people<00:03:16.060> would<00:03:16.180> have<00:03:16.209> given<00:03:16.510> up<00:03:16.720> by<00:03:16.900> now<00:03:17.079> and

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
people would have given up by now and

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.289 
people would have given up by now and
just<00:03:17.560> suck<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.430> out<00:03:18.639> put<00:03:18.879> it<00:03:19.000> into<00:03:19.299> a

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
just suck this out put it into a

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:22.559 
just suck this out put it into a
concentrator<00:03:22.299> or

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:22.569 
concentrator or

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:29.280 
concentrator or
blue<00:03:23.049> bowl<00:03:24.150> but<00:03:25.150> I<00:03:25.419> let<00:03:26.230> my<00:03:27.599> black<00:03:28.599> sands<00:03:29.049> run

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
blue bowl but I let my black sands run

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.819 
blue bowl but I let my black sands run
into<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:29.859> second<00:03:30.310> ring<00:03:30.519> here<00:03:30.849> and<00:03:31.780> then<00:03:32.739> I

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
into the second ring here and then I

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.559 
into the second ring here and then I
watch<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:34.810> surface<00:03:35.260> of<00:03:35.439> that<00:03:35.560> when<00:03:35.829> I'm

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
watch the surface of that when I'm

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.809 
watch the surface of that when I'm
running<00:03:37.569> very<00:03:38.349> small<00:03:38.769> amounts<00:03:39.099> of<00:03:39.220> water<00:03:39.370> over

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:39.819 
running very small amounts of water over

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.610 
running very small amounts of water over
it<00:03:39.909> and<00:03:40.979> eventually<00:03:41.979> that<00:03:42.340> dwindles<00:03:42.819> down<00:03:43.620> and

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
it and eventually that dwindles down and

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.399 
it and eventually that dwindles down and

00:03:50.149 --> 00:03:50.159 
from that the second ring thing

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.099
