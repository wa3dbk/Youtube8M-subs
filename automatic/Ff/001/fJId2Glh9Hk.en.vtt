00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.560 
us about today well it was very exciting
day<00:00:22.560> because<00:00:23.130> how<00:00:23.370> you<00:00:23.400> I<00:00:23.610> do<00:00:24.090> one<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.360> these

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
day because how you I do one of these

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.250 
day because how you I do one of these
procedures<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:25.880> you<00:00:26.880> actually<00:00:27.240> take<00:00:28.050> out

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
procedures and you actually take out

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.130 
procedures and you actually take out
something<00:00:28.770> that<00:00:28.800> you<00:00:29.390> suspect<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.750> from

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
something that you suspect is from

something that you suspect is from
somewhere<00:00:31.650> else<00:00:31.789> and<00:00:32.789> things<00:00:33.149> work<00:00:34.110> out

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
somewhere else and things work out

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.090 
somewhere else and things work out
according<00:00:35.250> to<00:00:35.460> a<00:00:35.760> plan<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.829> quite<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> good

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
according to a plan it's quite a good

we<00:00:39.780> had<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.140> object<00:00:41.130> show<00:00:41.310> up<00:00:41.520> on<00:00:41.820> an<00:00:42.239> x-ray

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
we had the object show up on an x-ray

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.750 
we had the object show up on an x-ray
and<00:00:42.960> cat<00:00:43.590> scan<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:46.010> when<00:00:47.010> we<00:00:47.190> did<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.520> surgery

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
and cat scan and when we did the surgery

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.300 
and cat scan and when we did the surgery
today<00:00:48.120> we<00:00:48.510> had<00:00:48.660> some<00:00:48.690> difficult<00:00:49.649> finding<00:00:50.160> it

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:50.310 
today we had some difficult finding it

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:51.740 
today we had some difficult finding it
on<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.820> ultrasound

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
on the ultrasound

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.319 
on the ultrasound
so<00:00:54.200> they<00:00:55.200> intrigued<00:00:55.770> you<00:00:56.579> know<00:00:56.700> as<00:00:56.910> if<00:00:57.090> they're

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
so they intrigued you know as if they're

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.549 
so they intrigued you know as if they're
not<00:00:57.989> there<00:00:58.290> did<00:00:58.620> somebody<00:00:58.770> take<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.370> out<00:01:00.559> where

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
not there did somebody take it out where

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.780 
not there did somebody take it out where
did<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.770> go<00:01:01.950> but<00:01:02.219> we<00:01:02.340> finally<00:01:02.610> located

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
did it go but we finally located

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.180 
did it go but we finally located
directly<00:01:05.790> into<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.690> spot<00:01:06.990> where<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.409> shows

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.000 

isolated<00:01:11.190> it<00:01:11.540> almost<00:01:12.540> immediately<00:01:12.870> and<00:01:13.620> took

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
isolated it almost immediately and took

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.719 
isolated it almost immediately and took
it<00:01:14.130> out<00:01:14.280> all<00:01:14.700> in<00:01:14.880> one<00:01:15.060> piece<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:15.690> some

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
it out all in one piece with some

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.120 
it out all in one piece with some
surrounding<00:01:17.729> soft<00:01:17.909> tissue<00:01:18.299> attached<00:01:19.130> that

surrounding soft tissue attached that

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.040 
surrounding soft tissue attached that
will<00:01:20.340> go<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:22.280> doing<00:01:23.420> biological<00:01:24.420> laboratory

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.930 

we'll<00:01:27.830> look<00:01:28.010> for<00:01:28.310> rejection<00:01:29.210> that<00:01:29.680> science

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
we'll look for rejection that science

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.670 
we'll look for rejection that science
inflammatory<00:01:31.940> signs<00:01:32.330> inflammatory<00:01:33.260> cells

portion<00:01:38.540> of<00:01:38.690> it<00:01:38.930> we'll<00:01:39.140> go<00:01:39.470> to<00:01:39.670> America

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
portion of it we'll go to America

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.030

our testing other metals I think it

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.359 
our testing other metals I think it
wasn't<00:01:48.350> very<00:01:48.560> well<00:01:48.740> once<00:01:48.979> we<00:01:49.070> found<00:01:49.250> the

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
wasn't very well once we found the

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.180 
wasn't very well once we found the
object<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.930> the<00:01:51.320> object<00:01:51.619> was<00:01:51.740> very<00:01:51.920> easy<00:01:52.070> to

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
object the the object was very easy to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.930 
object the the object was very easy to
find<00:01:52.400> an<00:01:52.580> ultrasound<00:01:53.110> previously<00:01:54.110> but<00:01:54.940> for

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
find an ultrasound previously but for

find an ultrasound previously but for
some<00:01:56.090> reason<00:01:56.420> had<00:01:56.869> almost<00:01:56.990> disappeared<00:01:57.229> this

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
some reason had almost disappeared this

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.170 
some reason had almost disappeared this
time<00:01:57.950> it<00:01:58.100> was<00:01:58.190> very<00:01:58.220> difficult<00:01:58.400> to<00:01:58.850> you<00:01:59.060> to

feature which will tell us what the

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.009

materials<00:02:58.100> made<00:02:58.340> out<00:02:58.580> of<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:59.750> then<00:02:59.840> we'll

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
materials made out of and then we'll

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.259 
materials made out of and then we'll
also<00:03:00.200> more<00:03:00.650> than<00:03:01.040> likely<00:03:01.220> cut<00:03:01.640> the<00:03:01.760> implant<00:03:02.150> in

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:02.269 
also more than likely cut the implant in

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.630 
also more than likely cut the implant in
half<00:03:02.480> and<00:03:03.110> examine<00:03:03.560> it<00:03:03.650> for<00:03:03.799> carbon<00:03:04.130> nanotubes

half and examine it for carbon nanotubes

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.020 
half and examine it for carbon nanotubes
and<00:03:05.890> that's<00:03:06.890> that's<00:03:07.190> pretty<00:03:07.400> much<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.820> for

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
and that's that's pretty much it for
