some service stars and I ran an ammo on
on<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.099> match<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.610> was<00:00:11.700> playing<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.179> picked<00:00:12.420> up

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
on a match I was playing and I picked up

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.839 
on a match I was playing and I picked up
a<00:00:12.690> kit<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.139> had<00:00:13.349> an<00:00:13.469> ACR<00:00:13.799> with<00:00:14.190> silencer<00:00:14.670> and

a kit that had an ACR with silencer and

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.460 
a kit that had an ACR with silencer and
foregrip<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.540> was<00:00:15.630> like<00:00:15.719> wow<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.109> sounds

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
foregrip and I was like wow this sounds

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.439 
foregrip and I was like wow this sounds
absolutely<00:00:16.710> ridiculous<00:00:17.340> because<00:00:17.609> ever<00:00:18.180> since

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
absolutely ridiculous because ever since

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.269 
absolutely ridiculous because ever since
the<00:00:18.600> patch<00:00:18.779> I<00:00:18.990> have<00:00:19.170> not<00:00:19.380> been<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.650> huge<00:00:20.039> fan<00:00:20.250> of

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the patch I have not been a huge fan of

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.490 
the patch I have not been a huge fan of
the<00:00:20.520> suppressor<00:00:21.060> but<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.480> have<00:00:21.930> been<00:00:22.140> looking

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
the suppressor but I have been looking

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.439 
the suppressor but I have been looking
for<00:00:22.740> that<00:00:22.769> class<00:00:23.160> that<00:00:23.189> just<00:00:23.460> really<00:00:23.970> excels

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449

engineer class because I like being a
sneaky<00:00:28.439> engineer<00:00:28.830> because<00:00:29.010> it<00:00:29.130> lets<00:00:29.310> you

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
little bit more effective and staying

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.790 
little bit more effective and staying
off<00:00:32.969> radar<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.630> really<00:00:34.050> good<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.230> big<00:00:34.590> maps

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
off radar is really good on big maps

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.299 
off radar is really good on big maps
like<00:00:35.010> this

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
like this

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
advantages and I had this ACR and I was

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:45.799 
advantages and I had this ACR and I was
fooling<00:00:44.879> around<00:00:44.969> with<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.360> I'm<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.539> man<00:00:45.780> this

fooling around with it I'm like man this
is<00:00:46.110> really<00:00:46.559> effective<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.489> really<00:00:47.879> do<00:00:48.030> enjoy

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
is really effective I really do enjoy

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.090 
is really effective I really do enjoy
this<00:00:48.570> now<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.350> kit<00:00:49.530> you<00:00:49.649> see<00:00:49.829> me<00:00:49.950> running

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
this now the kit you see me running

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.709 
this now the kit you see me running
right<00:00:50.370> now<00:00:50.489> doesn't<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.120> foregrip<00:00:51.510> like

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
right now doesn't have the foregrip like

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.869 
right now doesn't have the foregrip like
the<00:00:51.840> one<00:00:51.989> I<00:00:52.020> picked<00:00:52.289> off<00:00:52.469> or<00:00:52.980> picked<00:00:53.309> up<00:00:53.550> I

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
the one I picked off or picked up I

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.580 
the one I picked off or picked up I
should<00:00:54.090> say<00:00:54.420> rather<00:00:54.989> it<00:00:55.170> just<00:00:55.320> has<00:00:55.440> the

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
should say rather it just has the

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.500 
should say rather it just has the
suppressor<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.430> holographic<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.300> I<00:00:57.360> was

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
suppressor and the holographic and I was

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.479 
suppressor and the holographic and I was
like<00:00:57.690> okay<00:00:57.930> what's<00:00:58.350> what's<00:00:58.710> back<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.129> look<00:00:59.430> at

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
like okay what's what's back to look at

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.869 
like okay what's what's back to look at
the<00:00:59.579> factors<00:00:59.969> here<00:01:00.149> what<00:01:00.510> makes<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:01.530> ACR<00:01:02.129> W<00:01:02.550> or

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the factors here what makes the ACR W or

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.000 
the factors here what makes the ACR W or
acw-r<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:03.750> should<00:01:04.049> say<00:01:04.199> that's<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.500> tricky<00:01:04.860> word

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
acw-r I should say that's a tricky word

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.530 
acw-r I should say that's a tricky word
to<00:01:05.189> say<00:01:05.369> cuz<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.670> not<00:01:05.790> actually<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> real

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
to say cuz it's not actually a real

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.429 
to say cuz it's not actually a real
weapon<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.770> ACR<00:01:08.280> was<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:08.549> caught<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.939> ACR

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
weapon the ACR was this caught the ACR

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.750 
weapon the ACR was this caught the ACR
what<00:01:10.439> makes<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> ACR<00:01:11.130> with<00:01:11.280> suppressor<00:01:11.729> a

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
what makes the ACR with suppressor a

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.969 
what makes the ACR with suppressor a
good<00:01:12.119> you<00:01:12.390> know<00:01:12.479> what<00:01:12.810> makes<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.140> good<00:01:13.260> because

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
good you know what makes it good because

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:14.899 
good you know what makes it good because
I<00:01:14.040> was<00:01:14.159> thinking<00:01:14.340> about<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> was<00:01:14.700> like<00:01:14.760> okay

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
I was thinking about it I was like okay

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.910 
I was thinking about it I was like okay
the<00:01:15.119> ACR<00:01:15.509> notoriously<00:01:16.110> has<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> very

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
the ACR notoriously has a very

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.920 
the ACR notoriously has a very
consistent<00:01:17.340> damage<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:18.090> doesn't<00:01:18.479> really<00:01:18.600> drop

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
consistent damage it doesn't really drop

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.200 
consistent damage it doesn't really drop
off<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.200> lot<00:01:19.470> you<00:01:19.680> know<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:20.220> a<00:01:20.340> 20<00:01:20.670> damage<00:01:20.850> to

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
off a lot you know it's a 20 damage to

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.390 
off a lot you know it's a 20 damage to
16.7<00:01:22.140> so<00:01:22.259> you're<00:01:22.380> only<00:01:22.470> looking<00:01:22.950> at<00:01:23.070> what<00:01:23.280> is

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
16.7 so you're only looking at what is

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.440 
16.7 so you're only looking at what is
that<00:01:23.520> 3.7<00:01:24.450> drop<00:01:24.720> off<00:01:25.759> 3.3<00:01:26.759> drop<00:01:26.970> off<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.330> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
that 3.7 drop off 3.3 drop off so it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.330 
that 3.7 drop off 3.3 drop off so it
doesn't<00:01:27.479> really<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.290> lot<00:01:28.650> of<00:01:28.680> drop<00:01:28.979> off<00:01:29.159> so

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
doesn't really have a lot of drop off so

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
bullet kill with the ACR and even then I

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.260 
bullet kill with the ACR and even then I
found<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.040> ACR<00:01:41.430> is<00:01:41.549> kind<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.970> glitched

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
drop off starts at so the ACR you know

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.780 
drop off starts at so the ACR you know
it's<00:01:52.500> pretty<00:01:52.680> consistent<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.280> always<00:01:53.640> have

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
it's pretty consistent you always have

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.889 
it's pretty consistent you always have
that<00:01:53.939> six<00:01:54.149> bullet<00:01:54.420> kill<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.689> I<00:01:54.720> was<00:01:54.810> thinking

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that six bullet kill and I was thinking

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.300 
that six bullet kill and I was thinking
about<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.259> I<00:01:55.380> was<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.500> man<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.979> really

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
about that I was like man that really

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.100 
about that I was like man that really
makes<00:01:56.790> it<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.090> good<00:01:57.270> candidate<00:01:57.780> for<00:01:57.810> the

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
makes it a good candidate for the

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.840 
makes it a good candidate for the
suppressor<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.710> know<00:01:58.829> in<00:01:59.009> most<00:01:59.610> situations

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
suppressor you know in most situations

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.330 
suppressor you know in most situations
the<00:02:00.540> ACR<00:02:00.990> is<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.530> actually<00:02:01.710> benefit

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
the ACR is going to actually benefit

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.800 
the ACR is going to actually benefit
more<00:02:02.549> from<00:02:02.610> having<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> suppressor<00:02:03.600> there's

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
more from having the suppressor there's

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.780 
more from having the suppressor there's
really<00:02:03.990> no<00:02:04.229> reason<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.619> never<00:02:04.829> have<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.310> since

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
really no reason to never have it since

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.889 
really no reason to never have it since
it<00:02:05.909> always<00:02:06.180> is<00:02:06.299> going<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.780> know

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
I've always read it with you know the

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.070 
I've always read it with you know the
laser<00:02:15.400> sight<00:02:15.730> because<00:02:16.030> I<00:02:16.090> like<00:02:16.330> the<00:02:16.480> hipfire

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
laser sight because I like the hipfire

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.110 
laser sight because I like the hipfire
hipfire<00:02:17.440> has<00:02:17.860> always<00:02:18.010> been<00:02:18.340> part<00:02:18.880> of<00:02:18.940> my<00:02:19.060> game

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
hipfire has always been part of my game

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.150 
hipfire has always been part of my game
that's<00:02:19.570> just<00:02:19.660> you<00:02:20.110> know<00:02:20.140> something<00:02:20.830> I<00:02:20.920> can't

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
that's just you know something I can't

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:22.500 
that's just you know something I can't
get<00:02:21.310> past<00:02:21.580> you<00:02:21.880> know<00:02:21.970> I've<00:02:22.090> always<00:02:22.240> been<00:02:22.360> a

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
get past you know I've always been a

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.750 
get past you know I've always been a
hipfire<00:02:22.870> so<00:02:23.530> naturally<00:02:24.070> I<00:02:24.100> would<00:02:24.220> run<00:02:24.550> the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
hipfire so naturally I would run the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.240 
hipfire so naturally I would run the
laser<00:02:25.420> sight<00:02:25.690> with<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.050> but<00:02:26.230> I<00:02:26.440> found<00:02:27.100> that

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
laser sight with it but I found that

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:29.760 
laser sight with it but I found that
even<00:02:27.460> with<00:02:27.760> suppressor<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.420> ACR<00:02:28.870> has<00:02:29.290> pretty

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
even with suppressor the ACR has pretty

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.320 
even with suppressor the ACR has pretty
consistent<00:02:30.370> hipfire<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:30.820> still<00:02:31.090> doesn't

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
consistent hipfire it still doesn't

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.180 
consistent hipfire it still doesn't
really<00:02:31.600> get<00:02:31.840> penalized<00:02:32.260> too<00:02:32.530> much<00:02:32.710> from<00:02:33.010> using

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:33.190 
really get penalized too much from using

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:35.130 
really get penalized too much from using
the<00:02:33.490> suppressor<00:02:33.760> over<00:02:34.300> the<00:02:34.420> laser<00:02:34.600> sights<00:02:34.960> so

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
the suppressor over the laser sights so

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.260 
the suppressor over the laser sights so
needless<00:02:35.950> to<00:02:36.100> say<00:02:36.130> this<00:02:36.550> has<00:02:36.730> been<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.940> pretty

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
needless to say this has been a pretty

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.030 
needless to say this has been a pretty
awesome<00:02:37.420> set<00:02:37.810> up<00:02:37.930> for<00:02:38.080> me<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.200> have<00:02:38.440> been<00:02:38.470> really

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
awesome set up for me I have been really

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.580 
awesome set up for me I have been really
really<00:02:39.280> happy<00:02:39.580> with<00:02:39.730> the<00:02:39.850> results<00:02:40.630> of<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.870> like

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
really happy with the results of it like

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.410 
really happy with the results of it like
I<00:02:41.680> said<00:02:41.800> I<00:02:41.890> have<00:02:42.160> gotten<00:02:42.400> my<00:02:42.550> mastery<00:02:42.970> tag<00:02:43.240> now

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
I said I have gotten my mastery tag now

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.450 
I said I have gotten my mastery tag now
with<00:02:43.570> the<00:02:43.660> ACR<00:02:44.110> so<00:02:44.320> I<00:02:44.350> dunno<00:02:44.710> how<00:02:44.920> it<00:02:45.070> handles

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
with the ACR so I dunno how it handles

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.910 
with the ACR so I dunno how it handles
it<00:02:45.550> handles<00:02:45.850> very<00:02:46.180> oddly<00:02:46.960> it<00:02:47.350> takes<00:02:47.590> a<00:02:47.710> while

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
it handles very oddly it takes a while

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.810 
it handles very oddly it takes a while
to<00:02:47.980> really<00:02:48.370> get<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:50.530> ACR<00:02:51.040> down<00:02:51.280> because<00:02:51.700> it

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
to really get the ACR down because it

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:53.460 
to really get the ACR down because it
does<00:02:52.030> shoot<00:02:52.510> a<00:02:52.540> little<00:02:52.930> bit<00:02:53.050> different<00:02:53.350> than

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
does shoot a little bit different than

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.160 
does shoot a little bit different than
the<00:02:53.530> other<00:02:53.680> weapons<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:54.130> mean<00:02:54.840> granted<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:56.020> does

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
the other weapons I mean granted it does

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.720 
the other weapons I mean granted it does
have<00:02:56.350> a<00:02:56.380> smaller<00:02:56.740> magazine<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.370> a<00:02:57.400> lot<00:02:57.610> of

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
have a smaller magazine and a lot of

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.700 
have a smaller magazine and a lot of
people<00:02:58.000> don't<00:02:58.360> like<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.870> fact<00:02:59.050> that<00:02:59.140> the<00:02:59.290> ACR

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
people don't like the fact that the ACR

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.710 
people don't like the fact that the ACR
only<00:03:00.070> has<00:03:00.190> a<00:03:00.340> twenty<00:03:00.640> six<00:03:00.850> plus<00:03:01.090> one<00:03:01.210> so<00:03:01.600> you're

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
only has a twenty six plus one so you're

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.960 
only has a twenty six plus one so you're
looking<00:03:01.810> at<00:03:02.050> 27<00:03:02.560> rounds<00:03:02.860> per<00:03:02.980> magazine<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.610> lot

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
looking at 27 rounds per magazine a lot

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.130 
looking at 27 rounds per magazine a lot
of<00:03:04.060> people<00:03:04.270> get<00:03:04.360> annoyed<00:03:04.630> by<00:03:04.810> that<00:03:04.840> but

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
of people get annoyed by that but

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.390 
of people get annoyed by that but
another<00:03:05.440> thing<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.710> have<00:03:05.740> to<00:03:05.920> keep<00:03:06.040> in<00:03:06.220> mind

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
another thing you have to keep in mind

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.820 
another thing you have to keep in mind
is<00:03:06.610> it<00:03:06.910> reloads<00:03:07.360> faster<00:03:07.840> than<00:03:08.020> any<00:03:08.170> of<00:03:08.410> other

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
is it reloads faster than any of other

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.830 
is it reloads faster than any of other
engineer<00:03:09.490> choice<00:03:09.700> it<00:03:09.940> reloads<00:03:10.300> it<00:03:10.450> like<00:03:10.600> what

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
engineer choice it reloads it like what

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.870 
engineer choice it reloads it like what
1.8<00:03:11.470> seconds<00:03:11.950> which<00:03:12.130> is<00:03:12.280> up<00:03:12.520> there<00:03:12.670> with<00:03:12.820> the

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
1.8 seconds which is up there with the

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.770 
1.8 seconds which is up there with the
m16

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
m16

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.690 
m16
I<00:03:13.810> think<00:03:14.500> the<00:03:14.590> m4<00:03:14.920> has<00:03:15.010> a<00:03:15.070> pretty<00:03:15.340> quickly

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
I think the m4 has a pretty quickly

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:19.350 
I think the m4 has a pretty quickly
quick<00:03:16.239> reload<00:03:16.660> as<00:03:16.870> well<00:03:17.200> so<00:03:17.530> it<00:03:18.250> is<00:03:18.370> very<00:03:18.880> Swift

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
quick reload as well so it is very Swift

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.090 
quick reload as well so it is very Swift
on<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.720> reload<00:03:20.110> so<00:03:20.350> it's<00:03:20.500> not<00:03:20.709> really<00:03:21.070> that

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
on the reload so it's not really that

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.010 
on the reload so it's not really that
big<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:21.459> a<00:03:21.580> factor<00:03:21.940> at<00:03:22.030> least<00:03:22.209> in<00:03:22.330> my<00:03:22.510> eyes<00:03:22.720> I

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
big of a factor at least in my eyes I

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.810 
big of a factor at least in my eyes I
think<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.650> fact<00:03:23.860> that<00:03:23.920> you<00:03:24.070> can<00:03:24.220> actually<00:03:24.370> now

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
think the fact that you can actually now

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.850 
think the fact that you can actually now
have<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.120> choice<00:03:25.600> that<00:03:25.630> the<00:03:26.020> suppressor<00:03:26.560> works

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
have a choice that the suppressor works

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.920 
have a choice that the suppressor works
well<00:03:27.190> on<00:03:27.220> I<00:03:27.400> think<00:03:27.610> that's<00:03:27.820> really<00:03:28.120> cool<00:03:28.420> and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
well on I think that's really cool and

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.300 
well on I think that's really cool and
I'm<00:03:29.020> surprised<00:03:29.350> I<00:03:29.380> didn't<00:03:29.739> really<00:03:30.130> notice

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
I'm surprised I didn't really notice

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.890 
I'm surprised I didn't really notice
this<00:03:30.550> setup<00:03:30.790> earlier<00:03:31.180> to<00:03:31.330> be<00:03:31.420> honest<00:03:31.660> with<00:03:31.780> you

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
this setup earlier to be honest with you

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.120 
this setup earlier to be honest with you
guys<00:03:31.959> cuz<00:03:32.260> I<00:03:32.320> feel<00:03:32.470> like<00:03:32.680> it's<00:03:32.830> just<00:03:32.980> like

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
guys cuz I feel like it's just like

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.500 
guys cuz I feel like it's just like
sitting<00:03:33.459> there<00:03:33.520> right<00:03:33.820> in<00:03:33.940> your<00:03:34.000> face<00:03:34.209> so

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
sitting there right in your face so

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.990 
sitting there right in your face so
obvious<00:03:35.050> that<00:03:35.230> the<00:03:35.320> ACR<00:03:35.800> would<00:03:36.070> be<00:03:36.250> one<00:03:36.820> of<00:03:36.910> the

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
obvious that the ACR would be one of the

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.240 
obvious that the ACR would be one of the
best<00:03:37.270> engineer<00:03:37.780> candidates<00:03:38.230> for<00:03:38.560> having<00:03:39.070> a

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
best engineer candidates for having a

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.490 
best engineer candidates for having a
silencer<00:03:40.120> on<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.420> it's<00:03:40.630> pretty<00:03:40.840> consistent<00:03:41.019> I

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
silencer on it it's pretty consistent I

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.229 
silencer on it it's pretty consistent I
mean<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:41.709> don't<00:03:42.310> really<00:03:42.519> have<00:03:42.730> any<00:03:42.880> problems

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
mean I don't really have any problems

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.850 
mean I don't really have any problems
with<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.390> I<00:03:43.570> found<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:44.050> the<00:03:44.170> ACR<00:03:44.620> with

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
with it I found that the ACR with

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.370 
with it I found that the ACR with
silencer<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:45.550> the<00:03:45.910> ACR<00:03:46.420> with<00:03:46.690> you<00:03:47.200> know<00:03:47.290> I'm

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
silencer and the ACR with you know I'm

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.290 
silencer and the ACR with you know I'm
just<00:03:47.530> naked<00:03:47.739> or<00:03:48.040> even<00:03:48.640> with<00:03:48.790> heavy<00:03:48.970> barrel

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
just naked or even with heavy barrel

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.910 
just naked or even with heavy barrel
performs<00:03:49.840> pretty<00:03:49.989> much<00:03:50.230> the<00:03:50.410> same<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.620> don't

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
performs pretty much the same I don't

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.320 
performs pretty much the same I don't
really<00:03:51.100> have<00:03:51.310> a<00:03:51.340> whole<00:03:51.550> lot<00:03:51.700> of<00:03:51.730> problems<00:03:52.000> with

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
really have a whole lot of problems with

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.210 
really have a whole lot of problems with
it<00:03:52.510> so<00:03:52.690> there's<00:03:53.680> something<00:03:53.950> to<00:03:54.040> really

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
it so there's something to really

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.130 
it so there's something to really
consider<00:03:54.400> when<00:03:54.880> you're<00:03:55.030> choosing<00:03:55.330> a<00:03:55.690> weapon

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
consider when you're choosing a weapon

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.780 
consider when you're choosing a weapon
if<00:03:56.290> you<00:03:56.410> want<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.739> if<00:03:57.070> you've<00:03:57.280> been<00:03:57.459> looking

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
if you want to if you've been looking

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.270 
if you want to if you've been looking
for<00:03:58.030> a<00:03:58.420> place<00:03:59.019> to<00:03:59.230> kind<00:03:59.380> of<00:03:59.470> put<00:03:59.709> the<00:03:59.830> ACR<00:04:00.250> I

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
for a place to kind of put the ACR I

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.620 
for a place to kind of put the ACR I
think<00:04:00.550> I've<00:04:00.700> discovered<00:04:01.000> I<00:04:01.360> think<00:04:01.540> it

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:01.630 
think I've discovered I think it

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:03.840 
think I've discovered I think it
definitely<00:04:01.840> excels<00:04:02.830> at<00:04:03.010> being<00:04:03.220> a<00:04:03.400> silenced

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:03.850 
definitely excels at being a silenced

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:05.970 
definitely excels at being a silenced
weapon<00:04:04.180> I<00:04:04.269> think<00:04:04.300> that's<00:04:04.570> what<00:04:04.989> dice<00:04:05.620> put<00:04:05.890> it

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
weapon I think that's what dice put it

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.350 
weapon I think that's what dice put it
in<00:04:06.070> the<00:04:06.190> game<00:04:06.310> for<00:04:06.580> honestly<00:04:06.910> I<00:04:06.970> think<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.269> just

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 
in the game for honestly I think it just

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.970 
in the game for honestly I think it just
took<00:04:07.540> me<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.780> while<00:04:07.989> to<00:04:08.050> really<00:04:08.380> realize<00:04:08.950> that

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
took me a while to really realize that

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.550 
took me a while to really realize that
and<00:04:09.519> really<00:04:10.120> open<00:04:10.720> its<00:04:10.870> full<00:04:11.080> potential

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
and really open its full potential

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.320 
and really open its full potential
because<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.920> is<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.040> very<00:04:12.400> very<00:04:12.610> strong<00:04:12.940> weapon

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
because it is a very very strong weapon

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.850 
because it is a very very strong weapon
you<00:04:13.390> know<00:04:13.510> at<00:04:13.750> range<00:04:14.320> it's<00:04:14.560> going<00:04:14.620> to

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
you know at range it's going to

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.800 
you know at range it's going to
outperform<00:04:15.100> all<00:04:15.519> the<00:04:15.670> other<00:04:15.820> engineer

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
outperform all the other engineer

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.440 
outperform all the other engineer
weapons<00:04:17.200> and<00:04:17.410> I<00:04:17.500> think<00:04:17.709> that's<00:04:17.890> a<00:04:18.130> I<00:04:18.609> didn't<00:04:19.390> I

think<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.720> just<00:04:19.900> speaks<00:04:20.010> volumes<00:04:21.010> for<00:04:21.130> how

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280 
think that just speaks volumes for how

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.040 
think that just speaks volumes for how
well<00:04:21.729> it<00:04:21.850> performs<00:04:22.210> with<00:04:22.330> the<00:04:22.450> silence<00:04:22.780> I<00:04:22.870> mean

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
well it performs with the silence I mean

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.300 
well it performs with the silence I mean
there's<00:04:23.229> really<00:04:23.310> no<00:04:24.310> reason<00:04:24.550> to<00:04:24.760> not

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
there's really no reason to not

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.010 
there's really no reason to not
I<00:04:25.340> mean<00:04:25.639> if<00:04:25.760> you<00:04:25.880> run<00:04:26.120> it<00:04:26.240> without<00:04:26.389> silencer

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
I mean if you run it without silencer

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.120 
I mean if you run it without silencer
and<00:04:27.080> you're<00:04:27.200> running<00:04:27.440> with<00:04:27.590> silencer<00:04:28.040> you're

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
and you're running with silencer you're

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:30.640 
and you're running with silencer you're
going<00:04:28.370> to<00:04:28.430> get<00:04:28.550> the<00:04:28.669> same<00:04:28.910> effect<00:04:29.660> I<00:04:29.810> mean<00:04:29.990> even

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
going to get the same effect I mean even

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.900 
going to get the same effect I mean even
though<00:04:30.770> it's<00:04:30.950> going<00:04:31.190> to<00:04:31.250> drop<00:04:31.430> off<00:04:31.669> much

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
though it's going to drop off much

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.430 
though it's going to drop off much
faster<00:04:32.360> with<00:04:32.540> the<00:04:32.690> suppressor<00:04:33.169> on<00:04:33.200> there

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
faster with the suppressor on there

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.110 
faster with the suppressor on there
you're<00:04:33.530> not<00:04:33.680> going<00:04:33.980> to<00:04:34.040> notice<00:04:34.370> that<00:04:34.400> many<00:04:34.790> you

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
you're not going to notice that many you

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.240 
you're not going to notice that many you
know<00:04:35.470> differences<00:04:36.470> to<00:04:36.650> be<00:04:36.680> honest<00:04:37.010> with<00:04:37.130> you

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
know differences to be honest with you

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.250 
know differences to be honest with you
guys<00:04:37.280> so<00:04:37.669> at<00:04:38.000> long<00:04:38.300> range<00:04:38.540> it<00:04:38.690> still<00:04:38.930> performs

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:39.260 
guys so at long range it still performs

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:41.080 
guys so at long range it still performs
just<00:04:39.590> as<00:04:39.950> well<00:04:40.160> as<00:04:40.280> it<00:04:40.430> would<00:04:40.580> with<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.790> heavy

that<00:04:55.220> I<00:04:55.430> tend<00:04:55.730> to<00:04:55.790> do<00:04:55.940> that<00:04:55.970> a<00:04:56.120> lot<00:04:56.300> just

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
that I tend to do that a lot just

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.510 
that I tend to do that a lot just
because<00:04:56.780> games<00:04:57.020> get<00:04:57.230> super<00:04:57.590> long<00:04:57.860> you<00:04:58.400> know

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:00.139 
often if I'm trying to make a point I

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:01.629 
often if I'm trying to make a point I
will<00:05:00.290> chop<00:05:00.500> up<00:05:00.710> gameplay<00:05:01.100> from<00:05:01.160> time<00:05:01.490> to<00:05:01.610> time

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:01.639
