segments<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.950> size<00:01:13.220> varies<00:01:13.610> because<00:01:13.790> it

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
segments the size varies because it

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.149 
segments the size varies because it
wasn't<00:01:14.150> perfect<00:01:14.510> but<00:01:14.720> as<00:01:14.990> you<00:01:15.650> can<00:01:15.799> see<00:01:16.010> right

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
there it's starting to mix in a little

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.770 
there it's starting to mix in a little
bit<00:01:18.400> like<00:01:19.400> I<00:01:19.490> said<00:01:19.700> use<00:01:19.880> drinking<00:01:20.270> straws<00:01:20.540> cut

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.660 
regular airline tubing that bends in
through<00:02:04.600> a<00:02:04.630> hole<00:02:04.720> and<00:02:05.590> then<00:02:06.009> I've<00:02:06.100> got<00:02:06.280> bubbles

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
through a hole and then I've got bubbles

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.669 
through a hole and then I've got bubbles
coming<00:02:07.000> up<00:02:07.119> and<00:02:07.360> the<00:02:07.509> bottom<00:02:08.020> if<00:02:08.200> you<00:02:08.319> can<00:02:08.470> see

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
coming up and the bottom if you can see

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:11.970 
coming up and the bottom if you can see
right<00:02:08.890> there<00:02:09.840> I've<00:02:10.840> got<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.140> cap<00:02:11.380> on<00:02:11.650> this<00:02:11.800> was

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:11.980 
right there I've got the cap on this was

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.130 
right there I've got the cap on this was
an<00:02:12.130> old<00:02:12.280> creamer<00:02:13.030> bottle<00:02:13.480> if<00:02:13.630> you<00:02:13.720> guys<00:02:13.840> see

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
an old creamer bottle if you guys see

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.600 
an old creamer bottle if you guys see
them<00:02:14.350> they<00:02:14.530> have<00:02:14.709> the<00:02:15.030> damp<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:16.180> a<00:02:17.610> hinged

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
them they have the damp like a hinged

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.370 
them they have the damp like a hinged
lid<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:19.060> know<00:02:19.150> whatever<00:02:19.360> and<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.110> I<00:02:20.140> put<00:02:20.349> a

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
lid you know whatever and so I put a

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.580 
lid you know whatever and so I put a
piece<00:02:20.590> of<00:02:20.769> filter<00:02:21.519> floss<00:02:22.290> between<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.410> lid

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
piece of filter floss between the lid

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.800 
piece of filter floss between the lid
that's<00:02:24.580> just<00:02:25.030> going<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.209> work<00:02:25.330> somewhat<00:02:25.660> as<00:02:25.780> a

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
that's just going to work somewhat as a

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.110 
that's just going to work somewhat as a
pre-filter<00:02:26.080> not<00:02:27.040> really<00:02:27.370> like<00:02:27.640> I<00:02:27.760> said<00:02:27.940> not

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
pre-filter not really like I said not

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.539 
pre-filter not really like I said not
really<00:02:28.239> expecting<00:02:28.930> massive<00:02:29.799> filtration<00:02:30.400> and

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
really expecting massive filtration and

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.120 
really expecting massive filtration and
increase<00:02:31.060> by<00:02:31.299> adding<00:02:31.600> this<00:02:31.750> but<00:02:32.040> put<00:02:33.040> it

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
increase by adding this but put it

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.050 
increase by adding this but put it
together<00:02:33.250> so<00:02:34.709> here's<00:02:35.709> what<00:02:35.890> happens<00:02:36.220> air

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
together so here's what happens air

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.080 
together so here's what happens air
flows<00:02:37.510> in<00:02:37.840> bubbles<00:02:38.590> float<00:02:38.950> up<00:02:39.190> those<00:02:39.610> bubbles

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
flows in bubbles float up those bubbles

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.050 
flows in bubbles float up those bubbles
are<00:02:40.180> creating<00:02:40.920> suction<00:02:41.920> or<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.100> vacuum<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.819> some

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
are creating suction or a vacuum of some

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.360 
are creating suction or a vacuum of some
sort<00:02:43.390> and<00:02:43.900> what<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:44.260> does<00:02:44.470> is<00:02:44.709> water<00:02:45.069> gets

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
sort and what that does is water gets

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.940 
sort and what that does is water gets
sucked<00:02:45.700> in<00:02:45.940> through<00:02:46.180> that<00:02:46.209> bottom<00:02:46.750> flows<00:02:47.620> up

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
sucked in through that bottom flows up

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:49.979 
sucked in through that bottom flows up
through<00:02:47.980> here<00:02:48.370> follows<00:02:48.760> those<00:02:48.880> bubbles<00:02:49.299> I've

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
through here follows those bubbles I've

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.539 
through here follows those bubbles I've
got<00:02:50.170> holes<00:02:50.410> cut<00:02:50.680> around<00:02:50.799> the<00:02:51.040> rim<00:02:51.220> right<00:02:51.400> there

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
got holes cut around the rim right there

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:52.830 
got holes cut around the rim right there
and<00:02:51.640> you<00:02:51.730> can<00:02:51.880> see<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.120> bubbles<00:02:52.450> coming<00:02:52.750> up

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
and you can see the bubbles coming up

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.190 
and you can see the bubbles coming up
the<00:02:53.799> water<00:02:54.040> flow<00:02:54.370> act<00:02:54.810> goes<00:02:55.810> through<00:02:56.079> there

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
the water flow act goes through there

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.590 
the water flow act goes through there
too<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:59.320> so<00:03:00.310> as<00:03:00.489> this<00:03:00.760> colonizes<00:03:01.450> with

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
too and so as this colonizes with

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.930 
too and so as this colonizes with
bacteria<00:03:02.230> it's<00:03:02.470> going<00:03:02.680> to<00:03:02.739> start<00:03:03.010> swimming

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
bacteria it's going to start swimming

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.180 
bacteria it's going to start swimming
around<00:03:04.239> this<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:05.440> straws<00:03:05.739> will<00:03:05.950> start

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
around this the straws will start

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.520 
around this the straws will start
swimming<00:03:06.519> around<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.989> what<00:03:07.989> they<00:03:08.109> do<00:03:08.170> is<00:03:08.410> they

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
swimming around and what they do is they

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.050 
swimming around and what they do is they
clash<00:03:08.799> together<00:03:09.220> and<00:03:09.489> they<00:03:09.579> hit<00:03:09.760> each<00:03:09.880> other

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
clash together and they hit each other

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.500 
clash together and they hit each other
and<00:03:10.450> they<00:03:10.660> knock<00:03:11.200> bacteria<00:03:11.829> off<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.310> so<00:03:13.150> the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
and they knock bacteria off and so the

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.509 
and they knock bacteria off and so the
bacteria<00:03:14.019> that<00:03:14.049> stays<00:03:14.500> on<00:03:14.769> the<00:03:14.890> media<00:03:15.190> is<00:03:15.340> the

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
bacteria that stays on the media is the

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.330 
bacteria that stays on the media is the
strongest<00:03:16.060> most<00:03:16.690> resilient<00:03:17.230> bacteria<00:03:18.010> the

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
strongest most resilient bacteria the

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.640 
strongest most resilient bacteria the
best<00:03:18.609> bacteria<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.390> so<00:03:19.959> what<00:03:20.109> it<00:03:20.230> does<00:03:20.380> is

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
best bacteria and so what it does is

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.920 
best bacteria and so what it does is
eventually<00:03:21.340> you<00:03:21.489> know<00:03:21.609> you<00:03:21.670> just<00:03:21.850> got<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.299> pet

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
eventually you know you just got a pet

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.890 
eventually you know you just got a pet
group<00:03:23.109> a<00:03:24.150> segment<00:03:25.150> of<00:03:25.180> media<00:03:25.480> right<00:03:25.690> there

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
group a segment of media right there

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.530 
group a segment of media right there
with<00:03:26.049> just<00:03:26.799> awesome<00:03:27.220> form<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:27.910> bacteria<00:03:28.420> the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
with just awesome form of bacteria the

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.360 
with just awesome form of bacteria the
strongest<00:03:28.930> form<00:03:29.230> the<00:03:29.739> rest<00:03:29.950> of<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.130> stuff

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
strongest form the rest of the stuff

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.039 
strongest form the rest of the stuff
that<00:03:30.549> knocks<00:03:30.760> off<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.239> know<00:03:31.390> floats<00:03:31.690> into<00:03:31.870> the

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
that knocks off you know floats into the

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.309 
that knocks off you know floats into the
aquarium<00:03:32.530> it<00:03:32.650> still<00:03:32.859> does<00:03:33.040> its<00:03:33.190> job<00:03:33.250> but

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
aquarium it still does its job but

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.780 
aquarium it still does its job but
that's<00:03:35.319> my<00:03:35.560> basic<00:03:35.950> understanding<00:03:36.519> of<00:03:36.640> what

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
that's my basic understanding of what

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.300 
that's my basic understanding of what
this<00:03:37.000> is<00:03:37.290> not<00:03:38.290> sure<00:03:38.500> if<00:03:38.530> that's<00:03:38.709> right<00:03:39.040> if<00:03:39.190> you

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.310 
this is not sure if that's right if you

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:40.920 
this is not sure if that's right if you
guys<00:03:39.430> you<00:03:39.700> know<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.970> guys<00:03:40.060> can<00:03:40.359> correct<00:03:40.660> me<00:03:40.810> if

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
guys you know you guys can correct me if

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.720 
guys you know you guys can correct me if
you<00:03:40.959> want<00:03:41.260> let<00:03:41.470> me<00:03:41.560> know<00:03:41.709> let<00:03:42.310> me<00:03:42.430> know<00:03:42.549> what's

you want let me know let me know what's

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.670 
you want let me know let me know what's
actually<00:03:42.940> happening<00:03:43.600> here<00:03:43.810> because<00:03:43.989> I<00:03:44.200> try<00:03:44.650> to

actually happening here because I try to
do<00:03:44.859> my<00:03:44.980> research<00:03:45.130> but<00:03:45.549> you<00:03:45.790> know<00:03:46.540> threw

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
do my research but you know threw

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.809 
do my research but you know threw
together<00:03:47.590> pretty<00:03:47.920> quick<00:03:48.220> figured<00:03:48.519> I'd<00:03:48.639> show

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
together pretty quick figured I'd show

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.020 
together pretty quick figured I'd show
it<00:03:48.940> to<00:03:49.030> everybody

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030

I<00:03:51.440> like<00:03:52.440> to<00:03:52.590> look<00:03:52.740> at<00:03:52.920> stuff<00:03:53.130> like<00:03:53.190> this<00:03:53.459> guys

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
I like to look at stuff like this guys

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.240 
I like to look at stuff like this guys
it<00:03:53.910> makes<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.990> seek<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.410> see<00:03:55.680> stuff<00:03:56.010> like<00:03:56.130> this

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
it makes to seek to see stuff like this
