weight<00:01:13.619> every<00:01:13.830> day<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.640> like<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.390> more<00:01:16.080> say<00:01:16.439> well

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
weight every day I like to more say well

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.190 
weight every day I like to more say well
let's<00:01:17.220> say<00:01:17.670> they'll<00:01:17.909> eat<00:01:18.150> half<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.020> their

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
let's say they'll eat half of their

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.469 
let's say they'll eat half of their
weight<00:01:19.409> but<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:20.070> know<00:01:20.159> half<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.580> pound<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:21.030> day<00:01:21.060> a

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
weight but you know half a pound a day a

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.570 
weight but you know half a pound a day a
half<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.350> their<00:01:22.500> weight<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.009> if<00:01:23.130> it's<00:01:23.340> two

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
half of their weight so if it's two

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.270 
half of their weight so if it's two
pounds<00:01:23.820> they'll<00:01:24.240> eat<00:01:24.420> one<00:01:24.659> pound<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.140> day<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.920> in

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
pounds they'll eat one pound a day so in

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.670 
pounds they'll eat one pound a day so in
a<00:01:26.549> week's<00:01:26.759> time<00:01:26.880> put<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.750> approximately<00:01:28.439> seven

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.960 
a week's time put in approximately seven
pounds<00:01:29.280> of<00:01:29.520> garbage<00:01:30.680> now<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:32.310> about<00:01:32.520> two

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
pounds of garbage now in about two

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.179 
pounds of garbage now in about two
months<00:01:33.270> you're<00:01:33.750> going<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.350> take<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:35.009> you're

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
to be killed okay because the sunlight

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.420 
to be killed okay because the sunlight
does<00:04:50.760> kill<00:04:51.060> the<00:04:51.210> microbes<00:04:51.660> so<00:04:52.440> but<00:04:52.979> I'm<00:04:53.100> doing

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
does kill the microbes so but I'm doing

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.890 
does kill the microbes so but I'm doing
this<00:04:53.610> outside<00:04:54.090> for<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.360> purpose<00:04:54.690> of<00:04:54.810> the

00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 
this outside for the purpose of the

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.930 
this outside for the purpose of the
filming<00:04:55.350> but<00:04:55.979> I<00:04:56.190> put<00:04:56.430> it<00:04:56.550> underneath<00:04:56.789> the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
filming but I put it underneath the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.790 
filming but I put it underneath the
light<00:04:57.270> and<00:04:58.039> I<00:04:59.300> keep<00:05:00.300> it<00:05:00.479> up<00:05:00.660> and<00:05:00.930> the<00:05:01.590> worms

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
light and I keep it up and the worms

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.830 
light and I keep it up and the worms
will<00:05:02.130> go<00:05:02.280> down<00:05:02.490> to<00:05:02.729> the<00:05:02.850> bottom<00:05:03.240> because<00:05:03.449> your

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
will go down to the bottom because your

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.790 
will go down to the bottom because your
worms<00:05:04.080> are<00:05:04.440> light-sensitive<00:05:06.410> then<00:05:07.410> what<00:05:07.650> I<00:05:07.680> do

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 
worms are light-sensitive then what I do

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:17.479 
worms are light-sensitive then what I do
is<00:05:09.620> I<00:05:10.620> take<00:05:12.470> and<00:05:13.470> I<00:05:13.620> move<00:05:14.479> Mike
