 Yaroslavl videoblogger today 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:23.590
 prepare pike foil 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:26.320
 mangaya bake and here she is pike already 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:34.780

 there is even caviar inside there too two 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:41.940
 a piece of recipe will be unpretentious 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:41.940
 the usual recipe 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.180
 here 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.180
 laid on the foil 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.269
 recommend adding oils there or 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.550
 bacon 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:01:01.539
 slices of bacon that it was not somewhat dry 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.540

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:07.229
 wind blows only mary fly 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.229

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:16.880
 Here is this parsley greens, too, all put 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:21.289
 and spices are such a seasoning for fish 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:25.580

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.799
 skating all started eighty first 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.509
 year 1881 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.640
 yanush Tanya founded a mill at 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.280
 processing paprika later adding better 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.799
 and spices and spices from all over the world all 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.470
 our love is addressed to them as in those 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:45.830
 times so today touch and you 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.490
 to the source of our inspiration now 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:57.920
 touch 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:02:05.000
 such problems some kind of glutamate 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:10.150
 sodium some acid nothing brace and 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.150
 and sprinkle seasoning 

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.150
 dedicate 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.330
 unknown for the first time such seasoning 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.330
 take advantage 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.480
 somehow kinda like she's thermonuclear then 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.480
 seasoning so much we won't 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:46.430
 enough is enough 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:49.660
 better not to pickle and here's another pepper 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.660
 red ground sweet 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.099
 will go too 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:11.910
 oil can now be placed inside 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.060
 at the top also put 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.590
 pieces of butter 

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:45.230
 and on top two inside a little bit of this 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:45.230
 parsley something like this 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.660
 somehow more compact this whole thing 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:27.920
 better of course in two layers of foil then we 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:33.890
 not much and did not understand very well 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.890
 nothing was less closed 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.890
 here 

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:58.399
 everything turned out compact pie 

00:04:59.239 --> 00:05:09.419
 saw you are ready are ready to see 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:20.999
 more cattle did not fit the operator and then 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:25.800
 camera burned down heat for an hour 

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:28.309
 probably this whole thing will post as 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.309
 getting ready 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:49.100
 time has passed somewhere 40 minutes something here 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:54.200
 Generally this is yes no principle 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:57.680
 normally only parsley burnt 

00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:02.470
 very cool but a fish 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.470
 normal parsley color everything burned 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:10.300
 smells like some grass so for what 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:39.069
 very tasty turned out neither side 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:42.069
 there is a bone 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:42.069
 to make 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.539
 she even tasted 100 fish like 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:07:01.680
 as if it was smoked probably because 

00:06:58.539 --> 00:07:01.680
 that parsley is burnt 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:08.139
 what a taste of smoke here 

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:16.510
 very very tasty 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:22.540
