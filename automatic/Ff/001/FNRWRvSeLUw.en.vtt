way I play and I'm using hip 16 ACOG

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.040 
way I play and I'm using hip 16 ACOG

because the three round burst weapons

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.110

regardless of how good it is war in
modern<00:02:43.230> warfare<00:02:43.410> 3<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.550> there's<00:02:45.120> not<00:02:45.239> a<00:02:45.300> whole

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
modern warfare 3 so there's not a whole

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.760 
modern warfare 3 so there's not a whole
lot<00:02:45.600> of<00:02:45.630> movement<00:02:46.020> here<00:02:46.050> but<00:02:46.350> as<00:02:46.500> I<00:02:46.530> want<00:02:46.739> to

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
lot of movement here but as I want to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.160 
lot of movement here but as I want to
show<00:02:46.920> you<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.100> is<00:02:47.280> one<00:02:47.400> way<00:02:47.520> to<00:02:47.580> get<00:02:47.760> an<00:02:47.880> m16<00:02:48.480> I

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
show you this is one way to get an m16 I

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.020 
show you this is one way to get an m16 I
usually<00:02:49.800> don't<00:02:49.920> use<00:02:50.010> specialists<00:02:50.580> I<00:02:50.700> usually

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
usually don't use specialists I usually

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.840 
usually don't use specialists I usually
use<00:02:51.150> the<00:02:51.420> assault<00:02:51.810> kill<00:02:51.989> streaks<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:53.610> reason

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
use the assault kill streaks the reason

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.150 
use the assault kill streaks the reason
that<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.090> because<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:55.530> specialist<00:02:55.980> would

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
that is because the specialist would

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.300 
that is because the specialist would
help<00:02:56.430> me<00:02:56.580> but<00:02:57.390> it<00:02:57.480> doesn't<00:02:57.660> help<00:02:57.810> me<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.110> much

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
help me but it doesn't help me that much

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.820 
help me but it doesn't help me that much
like<00:02:59.310> I<00:02:59.760> like<00:03:00.750> I<00:03:00.900> like<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.200> have<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.530> assault

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
like I like I like to have the assault

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.710 
like I like I like to have the assault
kill<00:03:01.980> streaks<00:03:02.250> to<00:03:02.340> fall<00:03:02.519> back<00:03:02.700> onto<00:03:02.910> if<00:03:03.300> the<00:03:03.480> if

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
kill streaks to fall back onto if the if

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.930 
kill streaks to fall back onto if the if
the<00:03:03.900> mo<00:03:04.110> B<00:03:04.260> doesn't<00:03:04.500> go<00:03:04.680> through<00:03:05.010> and<00:03:05.820> I

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:05.940 
the mo B doesn't go through and I

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.460 
the mo B doesn't go through and I
usually<00:03:06.090> don't<00:03:06.480> worry<00:03:06.810> about<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.110> mobi

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
usually don't worry about the mobi

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.199 
usually don't worry about the mobi
unless<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:08.130> know<00:03:08.190> I'm<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.519> a<00:03:08.580> really<00:03:08.730> good<00:03:09.000> spot

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
unless I know I'm in a really good spot

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.210 
unless I know I'm in a really good spot

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
and I got a really good spawn trap going

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.150 
and I got a really good spawn trap going
on<00:03:11.340> kind<00:03:11.610> of<00:03:11.640> like<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.880> when<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.120> see<00:03:12.269> here<00:03:13.160> or

if<00:03:14.519> they<00:03:14.670> were<00:03:14.970> just<00:03:15.060> have<00:03:15.239> an<00:03:15.330> easy<00:03:15.540> time

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
if they were just have an easy time

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.440 
if they were just have an easy time

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
holding the trap on domination then I'll

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.699 
holding the trap on domination then I'll
worry<00:03:18.720> about<00:03:18.930> it<00:03:19.079> normally<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.410> would<00:03:19.620> just

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
worry about it normally I would just

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.920 
worry about it normally I would just

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:51.620 
people I kill with this I think it kills

the<00:05:51.740> team<00:05:51.919> twice

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.020 

all<00:05:55.930> right<00:05:56.080> s<00:05:56.230> six<00:05:56.590> no<00:05:57.010> my<00:05:57.160> got<00:05:57.340> six<00:05:57.610> I<00:05:57.760> just<00:05:57.970> I

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070 
guess it's just a multi kill variation

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.480 
guess it's just a multi kill variation
on<00:06:00.190> it

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:00.490 
on it

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:01.740
