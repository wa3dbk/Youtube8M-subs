without further ado let's go and get it
right<00:00:22.769> into<00:00:22.920> it<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.640> first<00:00:23.789> weapon<00:00:23.970> we're

vortex<00:00:26.460> I<00:00:26.670> have<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.359> number<00:00:27.630> 10<00:00:27.779> spot

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
vortex I have this in the number 10 spot

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.990 
vortex I have this in the number 10 spot
just<00:00:28.590> because<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:28.980> an<00:00:29.070> energy<00:00:29.400> weapon<00:00:29.429> it

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
just because it's an energy weapon it

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.519 
just because it's an energy weapon it
has<00:00:30.150> some<00:00:30.330> pretty<00:00:30.480> good<00:00:30.689> stats<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.199> mean<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.410> has

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
has some pretty good stats I mean it has

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.650 
has some pretty good stats I mean it has
a<00:00:31.560> plus<00:00:31.859> one<00:00:32.099> in<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.309> fire<00:00:32.550> rate<00:00:32.790> plus<00:00:33.270> two<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
a plus one in the fire rate plus two and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.049 
a plus one in the fire rate plus two and
handling<00:00:34.110> and<00:00:34.320> minus<00:00:34.770> 3<00:00:34.950> in<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.070> mobility<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
handling and minus 3 in the mobility the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.549 
handling and minus 3 in the mobility the
mobility<00:00:36.570> isn't<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.050> big<00:00:37.230> of<00:00:37.260> an<00:00:37.410> issue

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
mobility isn't that big of an issue

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:38.660 
mobility isn't that big of an issue
because<00:00:37.860> you<00:00:38.100> know<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.309> could<00:00:38.430> pretty<00:00:38.579> much

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
because you know you could pretty much

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.130 
because you know you could pretty much
just<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.420> know<00:00:39.540> hold<00:00:39.750> down<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.989> right

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
just you know hold down the right

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.420 
just you know hold down the right
trigger<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.500> don't<00:00:40.649> really<00:00:40.770> need<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.129> min

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
trigger you don't really need to a min

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.040 
trigger you don't really need to a min

which<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.100> amazing<00:01:11.400> now<00:01:11.909> listing<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.390> one

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
which is amazing now listing is a one

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:13.969 
which is amazing now listing is a one
burst<00:01:12.869> kill<00:01:13.110> most<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.619> time<00:01:13.799> which<00:01:13.950> is

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
burst kill most of the time which is

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.800 
burst kill most of the time which is
what<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.280> really<00:01:14.520> like<00:01:14.670> about<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.090> but<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
what I really like about it but the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.719 
what I really like about it but the
downside<00:01:15.990> is<00:01:16.409> that<00:01:16.439> has<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> minus<00:01:16.950> 2<00:01:17.220> accuracy

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
downside is that has a minus 2 accuracy

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.520 
downside is that has a minus 2 accuracy
and<00:01:17.909> minus<00:01:18.180> 1<00:01:18.270> fire<00:01:18.570> rate<00:01:18.750> that's<00:01:19.259> not<00:01:19.350> really

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
and minus 1 fire rate that's not really

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.899 
and minus 1 fire rate that's not really
too<00:01:19.710> big<00:01:19.860> of<00:01:19.950> an<00:01:20.040> issue<00:01:20.130> like<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.520> said<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:20.790> is<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
too big of an issue like I said it is a

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.149 
too big of an issue like I said it is a
burst<00:01:21.240> rifle<00:01:21.659> I'm<00:01:22.229> gonna<00:01:22.350> get<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.740> accuracy

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
burst rifle I'm gonna get that accuracy

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.649 
burst rifle I'm gonna get that accuracy
up<00:01:23.400> just<00:01:23.580> by<00:01:23.670> putting<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.939> couple<00:01:24.150> attachments

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
up just by putting a couple attachments

entire<00:01:36.180> damage<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.689> 10<00:01:36.960> and<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.530> thing<00:01:37.680> could

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
entire damage to 10 and this thing could

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.200 
entire damage to 10 and this thing could
just<00:01:37.979> rip<00:01:38.159> through<00:01:38.340> people<00:01:38.610> with<00:01:38.729> its<00:01:38.880> damage

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
just rip through people with its damage

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.420 
just rip through people with its damage
and<00:01:39.390> its<00:01:39.570> fire<00:01:39.750> 8<00:01:39.960> actually<00:01:40.590> like<00:01:40.710> 12<00:01:41.070> fire

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
and its fire 8 actually like 12 fire

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.039 
and its fire 8 actually like 12 fire
rate<00:01:41.640> so<00:01:41.790> this<00:01:41.939> thing<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.150> just<00:01:42.270> aw<00:01:42.600> it's<00:01:42.960> just

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
rate so this thing is just aw it's just

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.690 
rate so this thing is just aw it's just
crazy<00:01:43.470> you<00:01:43.920> definitely<00:01:44.100> need<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.490> add<00:01:44.670> a

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
crazy you definitely need to add a

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.130 
crazy you definitely need to add a
foregrip<00:01:45.180> on<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:45.479> thing<00:01:45.659> though<00:01:45.780> just<00:01:46.110> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
foregrip on this thing though just to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.480 
foregrip on this thing though just to
keep<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.380> under<00:01:46.560> control<00:01:46.590> because<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.280> fire

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
keep it under control because that fire

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.460 
keep it under control because that fire
rate<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.850> get<00:01:48.030> away<00:01:48.180> from<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.509> but<00:01:49.200> I<00:01:49.229> mean

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
rate can get away from you but I mean

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:50.960 
rate can get away from you but I mean
with<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.710> damaged<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.310> fire<00:01:50.579> rate<00:01:50.759> in

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
with the damaged in the fire rate in

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.520 
with the damaged in the fire rate in
combination<00:01:51.450> with<00:01:51.479> each<00:01:51.659> other<00:01:51.840> this<00:01:52.320> thing

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
combination with each other this thing

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.770 
combination with each other this thing
is<00:01:52.649> an<00:01:52.770> absolute<00:01:52.950> amazing<00:01:53.790> submachine<00:01:54.450> gun<00:01:54.600> so

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
is an absolute amazing submachine gun so

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.060

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
from cod4 just way it sounds the way it

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.280

rifle<00:02:29.310> in<00:02:29.970> my<00:02:30.000> opinion<00:02:30.330> has<00:02:30.570> a<00:02:30.600> plus<00:02:30.930> three

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
rifle in my opinion has a plus three

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.200 
rifle in my opinion has a plus three
accuracy<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:31.860> a<00:02:31.920> minus<00:02:32.130> one<00:02:32.400> handling<00:02:32.850> the

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
accuracy and a minus one handling the

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.430 
accuracy and a minus one handling the
handling<00:02:33.570> isn't<00:02:33.690> that<00:02:33.930> big<00:02:34.110> of<00:02:34.140> an<00:02:34.320> issue

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
handling isn't that big of an issue
