00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
mouth now we're going to colors colorize

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:29.540 
mouth now we're going to colors colorize
and<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:28.530> reason<00:03:28.860> we're<00:03:29.010> doing<00:03:29.040> this<00:03:29.490> is

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
and the reason we're doing this is

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.300 
and the reason we're doing this is
because<00:03:30.120> in<00:03:30.360> a<00:03:30.450> realistic<00:03:30.900> tattoo<00:03:31.320> there's

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
because in a realistic tattoo there's

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.510 
because in a realistic tattoo there's
almost<00:03:32.610> no<00:03:33.120> true<00:03:33.510> black<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.860> black<00:03:35.130> that<00:03:35.370> is

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:35.520 
almost no true black the black that is

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.390 
almost no true black the black that is
used<00:03:35.760> in<00:03:36.000> drawing<00:03:36.300> tattoos<00:03:37.130> usually<00:03:38.130> comes

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
used in drawing tattoos usually comes

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.880 
used in drawing tattoos usually comes
out<00:03:38.640> onto<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.450> skin<00:03:39.810> as<00:03:40.050> a<00:03:40.110> sort<00:03:40.920> of<00:03:41.010> dark<00:03:41.370> blue

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.120 
don't actually want it that high I found
that<00:04:05.970> right<00:04:06.150> around<00:04:06.420> 10<00:04:06.810> is<00:04:07.080> the<00:04:07.650> lightness

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
that right around 10 is the lightness

that right around 10 is the lightness
that<00:04:08.310> seems<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:08.790> work<00:04:09.000> best<00:04:09.410> so<00:04:10.410> click<00:04:10.709> OK<00:04:11.989> now

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
that seems to work best so click OK now

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:16.310

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
selection now so far it's looking pretty

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.620 
selection now so far it's looking pretty
good<00:04:19.320> but<00:04:20.130> we're<00:04:20.280> gonna<00:04:20.400> add<00:04:20.669> some<00:04:20.700> finishing

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
good but we're gonna add some finishing

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.530 
good but we're gonna add some finishing
touches<00:04:21.660> here<00:04:22.790> we're<00:04:23.790> going<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.030> change<00:04:24.300> the

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
touches here we're going to change the

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.020 
touches here we're going to change the
mode<00:04:24.780> of<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.080> dragon<00:04:25.620> from<00:04:25.860> normal<00:04:26.400> to

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
mode of the dragon from normal to

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.200 
mode of the dragon from normal to
multiply<00:04:28.100> and<00:04:29.100> we're<00:04:29.550> going<00:04:29.700> to<00:04:29.729> change<00:04:30.000> the

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
multiply and we're going to change the

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.340 
multiply and we're going to change the
opacity<00:04:30.540> of<00:04:30.900> the<00:04:31.080> dragon<00:04:31.530> from<00:04:31.830> 100<00:04:32.280> to<00:04:32.580> 80<00:04:33.350> the

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
opacity of the dragon from 100 to 80 the

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.690 
opacity of the dragon from 100 to 80 the
last<00:04:34.590> thing<00:04:34.860> we're<00:04:35.010> gonna<00:04:35.100> do<00:04:35.340> is<00:04:35.370> add<00:04:35.669> a

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
last thing we're gonna do is add a

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.850 
last thing we're gonna do is add a
little<00:04:35.970> bit<00:04:36.180> of<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.360> blur<00:04:36.570> to<00:04:36.810> the<00:04:36.900> dragon<00:04:37.380> so<00:04:37.680> go

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
little bit of a blur to the dragon so go

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.940 
little bit of a blur to the dragon so go
to<00:04:37.919> filters<00:04:38.220> blur<00:04:39.710> Gaussian<00:04:40.710> blur<00:04:42.950> you

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
to filters blur Gaussian blur you

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:46.090 
to filters blur Gaussian blur you
generally<00:04:44.490> won't<00:04:44.669> need<00:04:44.910> a<00:04:44.940> whole<00:04:45.210> lot<00:04:45.240> of<00:04:45.479> blur

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
generally won't need a whole lot of blur
