let's take a quick look at Scott's ride

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.240 
let's take a quick look at Scott's ride
this<00:00:49.420> actually<00:00:49.840> is<00:00:49.930> a<00:00:49.960> CRV<00:00:50.410> motor<00:00:50.680> although

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
this actually is a CRV motor although

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.620 
this actually is a CRV motor although
our<00:00:51.400> motor<00:00:51.550> mount<00:00:51.640> kits<00:00:51.910> actually<00:00:52.330> designed

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
our motor mount kits actually designed

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.750 
our motor mount kits actually designed
to<00:00:52.720> run<00:00:52.840> the<00:00:52.990> Accord<00:00:53.380> motor<00:00:53.650> it<00:00:54.370> had<00:00:54.580> to<00:00:54.670> be

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
to run the Accord motor it had to be

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.610 
to run the Accord motor it had to be
modified<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.210> run<00:00:55.330> the<00:00:55.450> CRV<00:00:55.780> we<00:00:56.050> totally

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
modified to run the CRV we totally

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.360 
modified to run the CRV we totally
suggested<00:00:57.280> you<00:00:57.820> use<00:00:58.810> an<00:00:59.050> accord<00:00:59.500> motor<00:00:59.680> or<00:00:59.860> tsx

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
suggested you use an accord motor or tsx

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.650 
suggested you use an accord motor or tsx
motor<00:01:00.580> which<00:01:00.730> is<00:01:00.760> what<00:01:00.970> the<00:01:01.030> kid<00:01:01.210> is<00:01:01.240> designed

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
motor which is what the kid is designed

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.950 
motor which is what the kid is designed
for<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:02.850> mount<00:01:03.850> kit<00:01:04.059> works<00:01:04.210> with<00:01:04.480> like<00:01:04.720> a<00:01:04.750> lot

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
for the mount kit works with like a lot

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.040 
for the mount kit works with like a lot
of<00:01:05.020> the<00:01:05.080> other<00:01:05.170> case<00:01:05.410> series<00:01:05.800> this

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
of the other case series this

transmission<00:01:08.050> size<00:01:08.230> mount<00:01:08.530> is<00:01:08.710> actually

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
transmission size mount is actually

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.150 
transmission size mount is actually
removed<00:01:10.840> from<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.140> frame<00:01:11.350> rail<00:01:11.590> and<00:01:11.920> then<00:01:12.100> the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:15.930 
hasp or mount is welded in place then
that<00:01:14.680> allows<00:01:14.890> us<00:01:14.920> to<00:01:15.160> bolt<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.550> engine<00:01:15.580> in

actually modified the corner here so
that<00:02:35.489> it<00:02:35.940> cleared<00:02:36.930> the<00:02:37.170> manifold<00:02:37.680> otherwise
