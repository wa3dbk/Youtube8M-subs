all these gaskets I'm not a mechanic but

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.460 
all these gaskets I'm not a mechanic but
this<00:02:50.180> is<00:02:50.360> what<00:02:50.540> I've<00:02:50.660> learned<00:02:50.690> from<00:02:50.989> have<00:02:51.260> from

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
this is what I've learned from have from

dealing with this issue from speaking to

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.150 
dealing with this issue from speaking to
the<00:02:53.420> mechanic<00:02:53.810> get<00:02:53.930> repaired<00:02:54.230> mine<00:02:54.410> these<00:02:54.950> are

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
the mechanic get repaired mine these are

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.920 
the mechanic get repaired mine these are
the<00:02:55.250> gears<00:02:55.459> one<00:02:55.790> of<00:02:55.910> these<00:02:56.030> has<00:02:56.239> gone<00:02:56.480> bad<00:02:56.690> at

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
the gears one of these has gone bad at

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.870 
the gears one of these has gone bad at
least<00:02:57.110> one<00:02:57.290> of<00:02:57.440> them<00:02:57.590> there's<00:02:58.310> your<00:02:58.489> timing

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
least one of them there's your timing

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.180 
least one of them there's your timing
chain<00:02:59.150> so<00:02:59.420> this<00:02:59.570> is<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.810> major<00:03:00.049> internal<00:03:00.860> engine

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
chain so this is a major internal engine

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.470 
chain so this is a major internal engine
component<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:01.910> in<00:03:02.000> the<00:03:02.090> words<00:03:02.269> of<00:03:02.390> the

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
component and in the words of the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.390 
component and in the words of the
mechanic<00:03:02.900> if<00:03:03.049> it<00:03:03.200> failed<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:03.799> are<00:03:03.920> going<00:03:04.220> to

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
mechanic if it failed you are going to

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.600 
mechanic if it failed you are going to
have<00:03:05.320> possibly<00:03:06.320> catastrophic<00:03:07.130> engine

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
have possibly catastrophic engine

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.449 
have possibly catastrophic engine
failure<00:03:07.640> it<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.450> a<00:03:08.600> big<00:03:08.989> deal<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.560> may<00:03:09.769> last<00:03:10.070> a

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
failure it is a big deal it may last a

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.460 
failure it is a big deal it may last a
month<00:03:10.790> with<00:03:11.000> this<00:03:11.150> noise<00:03:11.420> it<00:03:11.810> may<00:03:11.930> last<00:03:12.140> six

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
month with this noise it may last six

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.800 
month with this noise it may last six
months<00:03:12.799> it<00:03:12.920> may<00:03:13.040> last<00:03:13.250> a<00:03:13.400> year<00:03:13.760> or<00:03:14.150> longer<00:03:14.480> but

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
months it may last a year or longer but

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.170 
months it may last a year or longer but
eventually<00:03:15.110> it's<00:03:16.040> going<00:03:16.310> to<00:03:16.400> fail<00:03:16.610> so<00:03:17.120> you

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
eventually it's going to fail so you

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:18.880 
eventually it's going to fail so you
need<00:03:17.450> to<00:03:17.570> get<00:03:17.660> it<00:03:17.810> address<00:03:18.140> does<00:03:18.350> its<00:03:18.590> major

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:18.890 
need to get it address does its major

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:21.880 
need to get it address does its major
