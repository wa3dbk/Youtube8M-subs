they're not making them that they're not
making<00:03:26.730> that<00:03:26.970> many<00:03:27.120> I<00:03:27.239> saw<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.630> guy<00:03:27.840> on<00:03:27.870> YouTube

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
making that many I saw a guy on YouTube

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.680 
making that many I saw a guy on YouTube
he<00:03:28.440> had<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:29.340> same<00:03:29.549> one<00:03:29.730> like<00:03:29.880> this<00:03:30.090> but<00:03:30.630> he

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
he had a the same one like this but he

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.509 
he had a the same one like this but he
had<00:03:30.840> two<00:03:31.049> different<00:03:31.170> sets<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:31.620> rims<00:03:31.920> like<00:03:32.160> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
had two different sets of rims like the

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.699 
had two different sets of rims like the
rear<00:03:32.790> ones<00:03:33.000> here<00:03:33.269> were<00:03:33.750> the<00:03:33.870> same<00:03:34.079> but<00:03:34.530> then<00:03:34.620> he

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
rear ones here were the same but then he

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.130 
rear ones here were the same but then he
had<00:03:34.829> bought<00:03:35.160> ones<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.640> were<00:03:35.730> chromed<00:03:36.329> so<00:03:36.870> I

had bought ones that were chromed so I

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.289 
had bought ones that were chromed so I
think<00:03:37.920> they<00:03:38.070> ran<00:03:38.280> out<00:03:38.459> of<00:03:38.489> wheels<00:03:38.790> or<00:03:39.030> that<00:03:39.150> was

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
think they ran out of wheels or that was

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.110
