00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
side of the offensive line and that's

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:47.720 
side of the offensive line and that's
sort<00:00:46.469> of<00:00:46.590> what<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.829> is<00:00:46.860> but<00:00:47.160> we're<00:00:47.280> not<00:00:47.399> looking

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
sort of what it is but we're not looking

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.029 
sort of what it is but we're not looking
to<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:47.940> pressure<00:00:48.239> as<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.260> said<00:00:49.440> before<00:00:49.590> from

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039

the left outside linebacker instead

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.360 
the left outside linebacker instead

we're looking to get pressure from the
left<00:00:53.550> inside<00:00:54.120> linebacker<00:00:54.570> now<00:00:54.899> if<00:00:55.170> we<00:00:55.320> were<00:00:55.440> to

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
left inside linebacker now if we were to

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.010 
left inside linebacker now if we were to
run<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.890> blitz<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.399> is<00:00:56.879> we<00:00:57.600> wouldn't<00:00:57.899> get

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
run this blitz as is we wouldn't get

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.900

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.549 
that pressure so what we need to do is
make<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.120> couple<00:01:00.420> of<00:01:00.629> adjustments<00:01:00.719> before<00:01:01.289> to

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
done over the years before to snap in

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.190 
done over the years before to snap in
this<00:01:27.210> case<00:01:27.360> I'm<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.570> gonna<00:01:27.720> go<00:01:27.930> ahead<00:01:28.080> and

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
this case I'm just gonna go ahead and

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.420 
this case I'm just gonna go ahead and
hold<00:01:28.320> down<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> left<00:01:28.710> trigger<00:01:29.100> if<00:01:29.310> you're

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
playing on the PlayStation 3 you want to

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.230 
playing on the PlayStation 3 you want to
hold<00:01:33.810> down<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.229> l2<00:01:35.189> button<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.759> as<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.119> can

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240

see<00:01:36.299> right<00:01:36.540> there<00:01:36.630> basically<00:01:37.110> this<00:01:37.320> is<00:01:37.470> just<00:01:37.500> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
see right there basically this is just a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.050 
see right there basically this is just a
strafe<00:01:38.040> button<00:01:38.460> that<00:01:38.549> you're<00:01:38.670> holding<00:01:38.759> down

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.140 
strafe button that you're holding down
and<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.079> idea<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.560> this<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.909> go<00:01:42.090> ahead

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
and the idea of this is is to go ahead

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.850 
and the idea of this is is to go ahead
and<00:01:42.420> get<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.750> guy<00:01:42.840> right<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.560> go<00:01:43.680> ahead

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
and get this guy right here to go ahead

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.139 
and get this guy right here to go ahead
and<00:01:43.979> commit<00:01:44.250> at<00:01:44.369> least<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.640> look<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> blocky

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
and commit at least to look the blocky

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.760 
and commit at least to look the blocky
and<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:45.479> happens<00:01:45.750> to<00:01:45.810> be<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.020> left<00:01:46.560> guard

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and this happens to be the left guard

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
and this happens to be the left guard
right<00:01:46.979> there<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.880> reason<00:01:48.030> we<00:01:48.180> want<00:01:48.329> to<00:01:48.420> do

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
right there and the reason we want to do

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.960 
right there and the reason we want to do
this<00:01:48.720> is<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.110> we<00:01:49.229> don't<00:01:49.409> do<00:01:49.680> this<00:01:49.920> then<00:01:50.399> chances

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
this is if we don't do this then chances

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.399 
this is if we don't do this then chances
are<00:01:51.030> displace<00:01:51.420> isn't<00:01:51.689> gonna<00:01:51.780> work<00:01:52.049> and<00:01:52.290> I<00:01:52.350> know

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
are displace isn't gonna work and I know

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.749 
are displace isn't gonna work and I know
some<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.860> guys<00:01:52.890> out<00:01:53.220> there<00:01:53.250> might<00:01:53.399> think

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
some of you guys out there might think

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:54.740 
some of you guys out there might think
this<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.000> little<00:01:54.180> bit<00:01:54.270> shady<00:01:54.509> and<00:01:54.720> I

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
this is a little bit shady and I

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.690 
this is a little bit shady and I
understand<00:01:55.229> that<00:01:55.350> but<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.130> this<00:01:56.399> defense

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
understand that but really this defense

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.920 
understand that but really this defense
is<00:01:56.820> pretty<00:01:57.030> simple<00:01:57.210> to<00:01:57.360> counter<00:01:57.659> all<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.840> got

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
is pretty simple to counter all you got

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.149 
is pretty simple to counter all you got
to<00:01:58.020> do<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.229> leave<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> halfback<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
to do is just leave the halfback in the

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.850 
to do is just leave the halfback in the
pass<00:01:59.310> block<00:01:59.610> so<00:01:59.790> it's<00:01:59.939> not<00:02:00.030> some<00:02:00.439> type<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.469> nano

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
pass block so it's not some type of nano

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:02.719 
pass block so it's not some type of nano
that's<00:02:02.159> just<00:02:02.310> crazy

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
that's just crazy

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.980 
that's just crazy
type<00:02:03.060> Heat<00:02:03.360> it's<00:02:03.540> just<00:02:03.689> something<00:02:03.960> that

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
type Heat it's just something that

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.840 
type Heat it's just something that
you're<00:02:04.200> trying<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.530> do<00:02:04.680> if<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:05.460> were<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.670> watch

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
you're trying to do if you were to watch

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.249 
you're trying to do if you were to watch
a<00:02:05.939> football<00:02:06.119> game<00:02:06.450> sometimes<00:02:06.930> these<00:02:07.079> guys

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
a football game sometimes these guys

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.540 
a football game sometimes these guys
would<00:02:07.439> come<00:02:07.619> down<00:02:07.770> these<00:02:08.039> line<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.369> scrimmage

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
would come down these line of scrimmage

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.639 
would come down these line of scrimmage
for<00:02:09.090> instance<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:09.660> defensive<00:02:10.140> linebacker

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
for instance this defensive linebacker

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.280 
for instance this defensive linebacker
down<00:02:11.039> control<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.580> right<00:02:11.819> now<00:02:12.090> a<00:02:12.390> lot<00:02:13.020> of<00:02:13.140> times

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
down control of right now a lot of times

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.820 
down control of right now a lot of times
in<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> real

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
in a real

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.110 
in a real
while<00:02:13.980> you'd<00:02:14.130> see<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> guideline<00:02:14.790> up<00:02:14.910> near<00:02:15.060> the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
while you'd see a guideline up near the

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.250 
while you'd see a guideline up near the
line<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.330> scrimmage<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:15.720> all<00:02:15.870> they're<00:02:16.020> trying

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
line of scrimmage and all they're trying

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.960 
line of scrimmage and all they're trying
to<00:02:16.320> do<00:02:16.500> is<00:02:16.650> make<00:02:16.830> that<00:02:17.040> offensive<00:02:17.370> line<00:02:17.490> think

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
to do is make that offensive line think

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.970 
to do is make that offensive line think
as<00:02:18.120> he<00:02:18.240> Blitzen<00:02:18.600> or<00:02:18.690> C<00:02:18.810> not<00:02:18.990> Blitzen<00:02:19.380> and<00:02:19.590> all

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
as he Blitzen or C not Blitzen and all

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.290 
as he Blitzen or C not Blitzen and all
it<00:02:20.070> takes<00:02:20.250> is<00:02:20.460> just<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:20.940> little<00:02:21.060> bit<00:02:21.270> of

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
it takes is just that little bit of

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.180 
it takes is just that little bit of
hesitation<00:02:21.750> for<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.170> offensive<00:02:22.620> lineman<00:02:23.040> in

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
hesitation for that offensive lineman in

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.250 
hesitation for that offensive lineman in
this<00:02:23.310> case<00:02:23.490> the<00:02:23.640> left<00:02:23.850> guard<00:02:24.060> to<00:02:24.690> go<00:02:24.900> ahead<00:02:24.960> and

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
this case the left guard to go ahead and

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.660 
this case the left guard to go ahead and
think<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.590> he's<00:02:25.710> gonna<00:02:25.950> rush<00:02:26.250> and<00:02:26.490> by<00:02:26.610> the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
think that he's gonna rush and by the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.160 
think that he's gonna rush and by the
time<00:02:26.910> he<00:02:27.090> reacts<00:02:27.450> and<00:02:27.600> realized<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.050> he's

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
time he reacts and realized that he's

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.080 
time he reacts and realized that he's
not<00:02:28.380> they<00:02:29.220> were<00:02:29.280> already<00:02:29.610> getting<00:02:29.760> pressure

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
not they were already getting pressure

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.250 
not they were already getting pressure
on<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.300> quarterback<00:02:30.510> and<00:02:30.900> that's<00:02:31.020> what<00:02:31.140> we're

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
on the quarterback and that's what we're

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.420 
on the quarterback and that's what we're
trying<00:02:31.410> to<00:02:31.560> do<00:02:31.680> here<00:02:31.890> at<00:02:32.010> least<00:02:32.160> trying<00:02:32.370> to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
trying to do here at least trying to

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.740 
trying to do here at least trying to
assimilate<00:02:32.610> so<00:02:32.940> let's<00:02:33.120> go<00:02:33.270> ahead<00:02:33.330> and<00:02:33.420> run<00:02:33.630> to

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
assimilate so let's go ahead and run to

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:35.630 
assimilate so let's go ahead and run to
play<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.080> just<00:02:34.200> take<00:02:34.320> a<00:02:34.350> look<00:02:34.560> at<00:02:34.770> it<00:02:34.920> right

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
play and just take a look at it right

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.770 
play and just take a look at it right
there<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.120> then<00:02:36.210> you<00:02:36.300> just<00:02:36.330> go<00:02:36.540> ahead<00:02:36.690> and

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
there and then you just go ahead and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.850 
there and then you just go ahead and

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
from the left inside linebacker so it's

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.400 
from the left inside linebacker so it's
nothing<00:02:41.670> there<00:02:42.000> that's<00:02:42.240> my<00:02:42.690> opinion<00:02:42.930> that's<00:02:43.230> a
