00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.550 
but if you use the phone heavily like
playing<00:05:57.940> a<00:05:58.060> few<00:05:58.210> games<00:05:58.270> watching<00:05:58.870> a<00:05:59.080> serial<00:05:59.470> or

playing a few games watching a serial or
a<00:05:59.620> movie<00:06:00.009> then<00:06:00.789> you<00:06:00.970> will<00:06:01.090> definitely<00:06:01.300> need<00:06:01.930> to

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
a movie then you will definitely need to

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.960 
a movie then you will definitely need to
charge<00:06:02.380> your<00:06:02.560> phone<00:06:02.620> at<00:06:03.039> least<00:06:03.250> two<00:06:03.490> times<00:06:03.759> in

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
charge your phone at least two times in

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:06.659 
charge your phone at least two times in
a<00:06:04.060> day<00:06:04.210> the<00:06:05.050> battery<00:06:05.440> drips<00:06:05.770> down<00:06:05.979> very<00:06:06.340> fast

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:06.669 
a day the battery drips down very fast

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:08.939 
a day the battery drips down very fast
especially<00:06:06.909> while<00:06:07.570> gaming<00:06:07.870> and<00:06:08.169> this<00:06:08.740> might

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:08.949 
especially while gaming and this might

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:10.710 
especially while gaming and this might
be<00:06:08.979> because<00:06:09.310> of<00:06:09.520> the<00:06:09.729> overheating<00:06:10.419> of<00:06:10.570> the

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
be because of the overheating of the

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.070 
be because of the overheating of the
phone<00:06:11.669> the<00:06:12.669> dual<00:06:12.970> Sims<00:06:13.210> work<00:06:13.509> without<00:06:13.750> any

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
phone the dual Sims work without any

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.080 
phone the dual Sims work without any
issue<00:06:14.349> and<00:06:14.740> the<00:06:14.889> network<00:06:15.250> reception<00:06:15.729> was<00:06:15.909> good

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:16.090 
issue and the network reception was good

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:18.749 
issue and the network reception was good
on<00:06:16.240> the<00:06:16.360> phone<00:06:16.599> call<00:06:17.469> quality<00:06:17.680> was<00:06:17.889> decent<00:06:18.520> and

00:06:18.749 --> 00:06:18.759 
on the phone call quality was decent and

00:06:18.759 --> 00:06:21.480 
on the phone call quality was decent and
I<00:06:18.849> did<00:06:19.060> not<00:06:19.240> have<00:06:19.509> any<00:06:19.780> dropped<00:06:20.169> calls<00:06:20.490> one

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
I did not have any dropped calls one

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.310 
I did not have any dropped calls one
interesting<00:06:22.120> thing<00:06:22.150> about<00:06:22.479> the<00:06:22.780> canvas<00:06:22.990> light

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:23.320 
interesting thing about the canvas light

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.200 
interesting thing about the canvas light
is<00:06:23.560> that<00:06:23.889> it<00:06:24.070> supports<00:06:24.550> wireless<00:06:25.000> display

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
is that it supports wireless display

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.480 
is that it supports wireless display
which<00:06:26.139> is<00:06:26.169> probably<00:06:26.800> the<00:06:26.979> miracast

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:27.490 
which is probably the miracast

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.240 
which is probably the miracast
technology<00:06:28.360> because<00:06:29.320> I<00:06:29.349> could<00:06:29.590> easily<00:06:29.800> mirror

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
technology because I could easily mirror

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:32.879 
technology because I could easily mirror
the<00:06:30.490> screen<00:06:30.789> of<00:06:31.030> the<00:06:31.659> canvas<00:06:31.870> night<00:06:32.199> onto<00:06:32.770> my

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:32.889 
the screen of the canvas night onto my

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.680 
the screen of the canvas night onto my
Samsung<00:06:33.250> Smart<00:06:33.550> TV<00:06:33.880> over<00:06:34.180> Wi-Fi

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:39.570 

so<00:06:37.690> overall<00:06:38.020> the<00:06:38.260> canvas<00:06:38.650> night<00:06:38.830> is<00:06:39.070> a<00:06:39.130> decent

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
so overall the canvas night is a decent

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.460 
so overall the canvas night is a decent
phone<00:06:39.790> there<00:06:40.450> are<00:06:40.600> some<00:06:40.840> very<00:06:41.080> good<00:06:41.170> high

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
phone there are some very good high

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.260 
phone there are some very good high
points<00:06:41.890> about<00:06:42.100> the<00:06:42.280> phone<00:06:42.490> as<00:06:42.700> well<00:06:42.760> as<00:06:43.000> some

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
points about the phone as well as some

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.840 
points about the phone as well as some
very<00:06:43.480> bad<00:06:43.720> low<00:06:43.960> points<00:06:44.410> but<00:06:44.860> Micromax<00:06:45.460> this

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:45.850 
very bad low points but Micromax this

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:47.730 
very bad low points but Micromax this
time<00:06:46.090> deserves<00:06:46.630> the<00:06:46.840> credit<00:06:46.990> for<00:06:47.290> this<00:06:47.440> phone

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:47.740 
time deserves the credit for this phone

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:49.710 
time deserves the credit for this phone
because<00:06:48.160> it<00:06:48.460> is<00:06:48.580> a<00:06:48.610> huge<00:06:48.940> step<00:06:49.090> up<00:06:49.420> in<00:06:49.630> the

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:49.720 
because it is a huge step up in the

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:52.140 
because it is a huge step up in the
canvas<00:06:49.960> series<00:06:50.470> if<00:06:51.070> you<00:06:51.130> can<00:06:51.460> sacrifice<00:06:51.700> the

00:06:52.140 --> 00:06:52.150 
canvas series if you can sacrifice the

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:54.000 
canvas series if you can sacrifice the
battery<00:06:52.510> life<00:06:52.690> the<00:06:53.020> software<00:06:53.440> version<00:06:53.620> as

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
battery life the software version as

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:55.800 
battery life the software version as
well<00:06:54.070> as<00:06:54.340> the<00:06:54.400> overheating<00:06:55.030> problems<00:06:55.510> for

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
well as the overheating problems for

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.600 
well as the overheating problems for
some<00:06:55.990> better<00:06:56.170> performance<00:06:56.830> screen<00:06:57.160> quality

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:57.610 
some better performance screen quality

00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.640 
some better performance screen quality
and<00:06:57.820> maybe<00:06:58.120> the<00:06:58.300> camera<00:06:58.660> then<00:06:59.320> you<00:06:59.350> should

00:06:59.640 --> 00:06:59.650 
and maybe the camera then you should

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.230 
and maybe the camera then you should
definitely<00:07:00.220> go<00:07:00.430> ahead<00:07:00.460> with<00:07:00.910> the<00:07:01.000> canvas

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
definitely go ahead with the canvas

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.200 
definitely go ahead with the canvas
