00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
the more general picture well there

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.020 
the more general picture well there
certainly<00:02:09.840> been<00:02:10.080> no<00:02:10.349> major<00:02:11.030> terrorist

some<00:02:13.560> attempts<00:02:14.250> of<00:02:14.430> course<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.470> point<00:02:16.740> is

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
some attempts of course the the point is

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.580 
some attempts of course the the point is
is<00:02:17.760> whether<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.420> administration<00:02:18.540> is<00:02:19.290> being

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
is whether the administration is being

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.460 
is whether the administration is being
true<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.040> American<00:02:20.460> ideals<00:02:21.110> being<00:02:22.110> true

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
true to the American ideals being true

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.350 
true to the American ideals being true
to<00:02:22.710> this<00:02:22.860> notion<00:02:23.130> that<00:02:23.430> there<00:02:23.670> are<00:02:23.790> individual

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
to this notion that there are individual

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.870 
to this notion that there are individual
rights<00:02:24.630> that<00:02:24.840> must<00:02:25.080> be<00:02:25.230> respected<00:02:25.380> in<00:02:26.070> in<00:02:26.730> the
