now<00:04:13.200> but<00:04:14.130> in<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:14.459> game<00:04:14.580> i<00:04:14.730> guess<00:04:14.850> i<00:04:15.060> didn't

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
now but in this game i guess i didn't

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:16.520 
now but in this game i guess i didn't
think<00:04:15.390> of<00:04:15.450> it<00:04:15.540> until<00:04:15.780> right<00:04:16.019> here<00:04:16.229> i<00:04:16.260> have<00:04:16.470> a

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
think of it until right here i have a

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.400 
think of it until right here i have a
spy<00:04:16.919> and<00:04:17.609> i<00:04:18.120> have<00:04:18.239> a<00:04:18.269> good<00:04:18.600> zone<00:04:18.780> coverage<00:04:19.260> and

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
spy and i have a good zone coverage and

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.229 
spy and i have a good zone coverage and
so<00:04:19.470> he<00:04:19.560> has<00:04:19.680> to<00:04:19.769> take<00:04:19.919> a<00:04:19.979> chance<00:04:20.310> on<00:04:20.519> third<00:04:20.760> 11

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 
so he has to take a chance on third 11

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:23.810 
so he has to take a chance on third 11
and<00:04:21.450> i<00:04:21.930> batted<00:04:22.560> away<00:04:22.650> so<00:04:22.830> it<00:04:23.130> kicks<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:23.640> field
