00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:45.989 
show that silver can do this
my<00:06:44.949> theory<00:06:45.159> is<00:06:45.309> more<00:06:45.460> to<00:06:45.580> do<00:06:45.669> with<00:06:45.759> things<00:06:45.969> that

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:45.999 
my theory is more to do with things that

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:47.820 
my theory is more to do with things that
we<00:06:46.149> see<00:06:46.300> from<00:06:46.449> the<00:06:46.599> show<00:06:46.779> first<00:06:47.379> let's<00:06:47.589> look<00:06:47.740> at

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
we see from the show first let's look at

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:50.249 
we see from the show first let's look at
her<00:06:47.949> name<00:06:48.159> silver<00:06:48.969> spoon<00:06:49.210> now<00:06:49.629> silver<00:06:50.080> is

00:06:50.249 --> 00:06:50.259 
her name silver spoon now silver is

00:06:50.259 --> 00:06:52.619 
her name silver spoon now silver is
commonly<00:06:50.949> associated<00:06:51.460> with<00:06:51.580> second<00:06:52.210> place<00:06:52.240> or

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:52.629 
commonly associated with second place or

00:06:52.629 --> 00:06:55.200 
commonly associated with second place or
maybe<00:06:53.229> second<00:06:53.770> banana<00:06:53.939> we<00:06:54.939> already

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:55.210 
maybe second banana we already

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:56.609 
maybe second banana we already
established<00:06:55.330> that<00:06:55.629> silver<00:06:55.899> has<00:06:55.990> never<00:06:56.319> seen

00:06:56.609 --> 00:06:56.619 
established that silver has never seen

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:58.379 
established that silver has never seen
without<00:06:56.770> diamond<00:06:57.339> so<00:06:57.909> it<00:06:58.029> stands<00:06:58.210> to<00:06:58.360> reason

00:06:58.379 --> 00:06:58.389 
without diamond so it stands to reason

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:00.239 
without diamond so it stands to reason
that<00:06:58.659> Silver's<00:06:59.080> cutie<00:06:59.379> mark<00:06:59.559> may<00:07:00.129> have

00:07:00.239 --> 00:07:00.249 
that Silver's cutie mark may have

00:07:00.249 --> 00:07:01.350 
that Silver's cutie mark may have
something<00:07:00.399> to<00:07:00.550> do<00:07:00.610> with<00:07:00.639> being<00:07:00.879> some<00:07:01.059> kind<00:07:01.180> of

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
something to do with being some kind of

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.999 
something to do with being some kind of
second<00:07:01.809> command<00:07:02.169> you<00:07:02.439> know<00:07:02.559> like<00:07:02.770> giving

00:07:02.999 --> 00:07:03.009 
second command you know like giving

00:07:03.009 --> 00:07:04.350 
second command you know like giving
confidence<00:07:03.339> or<00:07:03.580> support<00:07:03.879> to<00:07:04.029> the<00:07:04.119> one<00:07:04.240> in

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:04.360 
confidence or support to the one in

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.999 
confidence or support to the one in
charge<00:07:04.569> now<00:07:05.199> you<00:07:05.259> may<00:07:05.349> think<00:07:05.379> that's<00:07:05.649> a<00:07:05.710> lame

00:07:05.999 --> 00:07:06.009 
charge now you may think that's a lame

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:08.219 
charge now you may think that's a lame
destiny<00:07:06.610> or<00:07:06.789> Talent<00:07:07.270> but<00:07:07.809> really<00:07:07.990> think<00:07:08.169> about

00:07:08.219 --> 00:07:08.229 
destiny or Talent but really think about

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:09.899 
destiny or Talent but really think about
it<00:07:08.529> most<00:07:09.009> people<00:07:09.189> have<00:07:09.430> someone<00:07:09.699> in<00:07:09.789> their

life who help them and give them support

00:07:11.499 --> 00:07:13.279 
life who help them and give them support
which<00:07:11.710> in<00:07:11.860> turn<00:07:11.979> helps<00:07:12.550> them<00:07:12.639> be<00:07:12.759> successful

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:13.289 
which in turn helps them be successful

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:15.629

silver<00:07:14.289> does<00:07:14.499> show<00:07:14.740> almost<00:07:14.919> unwavering

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:15.639 
silver does show almost unwavering

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:17.159 
silver does show almost unwavering
loyalty<00:07:15.819> towards<00:07:16.360> diamond<00:07:16.689> despite<00:07:16.990> not

00:07:17.159 --> 00:07:17.169 
loyalty towards diamond despite not

00:07:17.169 --> 00:07:19.170

being<00:07:17.199> treated<00:07:17.589> the<00:07:17.770> same<00:07:17.949> by<00:07:18.129> diamond<00:07:18.490> so

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:19.180 
being treated the same by diamond so

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.209 
being treated the same by diamond so
maybe<00:07:19.419> there's<00:07:19.599> something<00:07:19.629> there<00:07:20.039> also<00:07:21.039> if
