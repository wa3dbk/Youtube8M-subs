00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
pointless to commentate on these guys

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:27.670 
pointless to commentate on these guys
and<00:04:26.900> stuff<00:04:27.050> well<00:04:27.200> let's<00:04:27.350> see<00:04:27.470> what<00:04:27.560> he<00:04:27.650> does

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680

spells there's no double bombs in the
middle<00:04:33.290> of<00:04:33.350> this<00:04:33.470> base<00:04:33.770> so<00:04:34.450> you<00:04:35.450> can<00:04:35.630> tell

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
middle of this base so you can tell

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.000 
middle of this base so you can tell
where<00:04:35.990> the<00:04:36.110> bombs<00:04:36.290> are<00:04:36.470> going<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.710> be<00:04:36.830> and

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.010 
where the bombs are going to be and

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:37.990 
where the bombs are going to be and
that's<00:04:37.040> just<00:04:37.250> where<00:04:37.430> you<00:04:37.520> drop<00:04:37.730> your<00:04:37.850> heal

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 
that's just where you drop your heal

spells and he has released his hogs in
different<00:04:40.310> groups<00:04:40.430> i<00:04:40.670> think<00:04:40.820> that's<00:04:41.000> solid<00:04:41.210> a

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
different groups i think that's solid a

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.660 
different groups i think that's solid a
little<00:04:42.410> early<00:04:42.680> on<00:04:42.800> that<00:04:42.920> heal<00:04:43.190> spell<00:04:43.220> but

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:43.670 
little early on that heal spell but

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:45.400 
little early on that heal spell but
that's<00:04:43.850> fine<00:04:44.060> oh<00:04:44.270> that<00:04:44.840> one's<00:04:44.990> overlapping

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
that's fine oh that one's overlapping

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:50.650 
that's fine oh that one's overlapping
kind<00:04:45.860> of<00:04:45.950> a<00:04:46.040> waste<00:04:47.770> he<00:04:48.770> should<00:04:49.010> save<00:04:49.280> to<00:04:49.850> heels

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:50.660 
kind of a waste he should save to heels

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:52.810 
kind of a waste he should save to heels
do<00:04:51.380> one<00:04:51.560> now<00:04:51.740> on<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:52.070> left<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:52.490> one<00:04:52.640> on<00:04:52.670> the

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
do one now on the left and one on the

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.850 
do one now on the left and one on the
right<00:04:53.000> that's<00:04:53.210> what<00:04:53.300> he<00:04:53.420> should<00:04:53.630> do<00:04:53.870> okay

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
right that's what he should do okay

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.220 
right that's what he should do okay
there's<00:04:55.070> the<00:04:55.190> one<00:04:55.310> on<00:04:55.400> the<00:04:55.490> right<00:04:59.050> buddies<00:05:00.050> at

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
there's the one on the right buddies at

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:06.750 
there's the one on the right buddies at
my<00:05:00.350> mom's<00:05:00.620> house<00:05:00.920> I<00:05:01.960> don't<00:05:02.960> know<00:05:03.050> why

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:09.280 

the<00:05:07.760> trick<00:05:07.970> about<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.240> good<00:05:08.450> hog<00:05:08.660> attack<00:05:08.990> is<00:05:09.170> you

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
the trick about a good hog attack is you

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.950 
the trick about a good hog attack is you
have<00:05:09.440> to<00:05:09.560> have<00:05:09.710> hogs<00:05:10.160> survive<00:05:10.850> after<00:05:11.540> all<00:05:11.750> the

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:11.960 
have to have hogs survive after all the

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.020 
have to have hogs survive after all the
defenses<00:05:12.470> are<00:05:12.620> taken<00:05:12.950> out<00:05:13.070> now<00:05:13.640> this<00:05:13.820> whole

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:14.030 
defenses are taken out now this whole

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.180 
defenses are taken out now this whole
skeleton<00:05:14.570> mess<00:05:14.780> that<00:05:14.960> they<00:05:15.080> added<00:05:15.410> really

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
skeleton mess that they added really

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:17.380 
skeleton mess that they added really
change<00:05:16.490> things<00:05:16.730> up<00:05:16.940> because<00:05:17.060> you<00:05:17.240> got

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:17.390 
change things up because you got

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:19.000 
change things up because you got
skeletons<00:05:17.660> chasing<00:05:18.260> your<00:05:18.380> hogs<00:05:18.590> the<00:05:18.830> whole

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
skeletons chasing your hogs the whole

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.790 
skeletons chasing your hogs the whole
time<00:05:19.250> and<00:05:19.460> they<00:05:19.580> just<00:05:19.610> need<00:05:20.390> them<00:05:20.630> apart<00:05:20.990> so<00:05:21.440> if

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
time and they just need them apart so if

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.250 
time and they just need them apart so if
you're<00:05:21.920> hogging<00:05:22.400> the<00:05:23.120> trick<00:05:23.480> is<00:05:23.690> to<00:05:23.720> have<00:05:24.080> your

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
you're hogging the trick is to have your

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.020 
you're hogging the trick is to have your
hogs<00:05:24.530> and<00:05:24.860> we're<00:05:25.100> the<00:05:25.190> king<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:25.550> queen<00:05:25.700> art

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
hogs and we're the king and queen art

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.640 
hogs and we're the king and queen art
this<00:05:26.690> is<00:05:26.810> going<00:05:26.930> to<00:05:26.990> be<00:05:27.080> tricky<00:05:27.380> because<00:05:27.440> now

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:27.650 
this is going to be tricky because now

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.110 
this is going to be tricky because now
the<00:05:27.710> Hogs<00:05:27.920> have<00:05:28.130> to<00:05:28.220> go<00:05:28.340> all<00:05:28.370> that<00:05:28.670> looked<00:05:28.850> he's

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120 
the Hogs have to go all that looked he's

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.200 
the Hogs have to go all that looked he's
got<00:05:29.330> one<00:05:29.510> hog<00:05:29.750> left<00:05:30.220> he<00:05:31.220> might<00:05:31.430> get<00:05:31.640> two<00:05:31.880> stars

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:32.210 
got one hog left he might get two stars

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.660 
got one hog left he might get two stars
but<00:05:32.480> I<00:05:32.540> highly<00:05:33.170> doubt<00:05:33.590> it<00:05:33.650> it's<00:05:34.250> got<00:05:34.400> a<00:05:34.430> good

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:34.670 
but I highly doubt it it's got a good

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:36.130 
but I highly doubt it it's got a good
group<00:05:34.820> of<00:05:35.000> wizards<00:05:35.150> behind<00:05:35.630> that<00:05:35.750> barbarian

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
group of wizards behind that barbarian

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.840 
group of wizards behind that barbarian
king<00:05:36.560> but<00:05:36.740> it<00:05:36.830> doesn't<00:05:37.040> have<00:05:37.130> a<00:05:37.190> rage<00:05:37.430> on<00:05:37.670> that

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:37.850 
king but it doesn't have a rage on that

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:43.060 
king but it doesn't have a rage on that
King<00:05:38.120> I<00:05:41.020> might<00:05:42.020> have<00:05:42.170> to<00:05:42.290> go<00:05:42.440> I<00:05:42.470> think<00:05:42.710> there's

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
King I might have to go I think there's

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.000 
King I might have to go I think there's
something<00:05:43.310> up<00:05:43.520> I<00:05:43.730> think<00:05:44.000> my<00:05:44.840> mom<00:05:45.110> moms<00:05:45.620> crying

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:46.010 
something up I think my mom moms crying

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.740 
something up I think my mom moms crying
her<00:05:46.280> son<00:05:48.160> um<00:05:49.160> yeah<00:05:49.970> he's<00:05:50.300> not<00:05:50.420> going<00:05:50.570> to<00:05:50.600> get

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
her son um yeah he's not going to get
