00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
take out but i'm pretty sure that frying

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.140 
take out but i'm pretty sure that frying
stuff<00:00:37.170> doesn't<00:00:38.010> require<00:00:38.220> electricity<00:00:38.430> at

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
and even if it did i mean i think

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.770 
and even if it did i mean i think
there's<00:00:44.580> probably<00:00:44.730> a<00:00:44.970> difference<00:00:45.390> between

both you and its heart to work harder so

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:27.900 
both you and its heart to work harder so
it's<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.200> really<00:02:26.349> simple<00:02:26.829> concept<00:02:27.489> but<00:02:27.609> the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
it's a really simple concept but the

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.030 
it's a really simple concept but the
game<00:02:28.090> throws<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:28.629> plenty<00:02:28.989> of<00:02:29.049> twists<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.859> keep
