couple of inches which i think makes the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.700 
couple of inches which i think makes the
difference<00:01:32.490> first<00:01:32.790> sleeping<00:01:33.689> toddler<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
difference first sleeping toddler just a

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
couple inches make it just a little bit

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:36.830 
couple inches make it just a little bit
more<00:01:36.420> comfort

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
more comfort

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.770 
more comfort
for<00:01:37.049> them<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.829> maybe<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.359> makes<00:01:39.570> me

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
for them and maybe it's just it makes me

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.569 
for them and maybe it's just it makes me
feel<00:01:39.960> better<00:01:40.170> that<00:01:40.950> she's<00:01:41.189> not<00:01:41.369> sitting
