itself or the tremolo this portion here
you<00:02:08.970> screw<00:02:09.270> these<00:02:09.450> screws<00:02:09.810> again<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:11.130> can<00:02:11.280> use

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
you screw these screws again you can use

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.370 
you screw these screws again you can use
it<00:02:11.460> really<00:02:11.670> prefer<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.120> just<00:02:12.480> rather<00:02:13.020> do<00:02:13.200> it<00:02:13.260> by

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
it really prefer I just rather do it by

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.060 
it really prefer I just rather do it by
hand<00:02:17.959> just<00:02:18.959> relieve<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.320> tension<00:02:19.680> enough<00:02:19.920> to

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
hand just relieve the tension enough to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.980 
hand just relieve the tension enough to
go<00:02:20.160> ahead<00:02:20.280> and<00:02:20.490> release<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.900> springs<00:02:23.990> once

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:24.990 
go ahead and release the springs once

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.699 
go ahead and release the springs once
you've<00:02:25.110> got<00:02:25.290> those<00:02:25.470> off<00:02:27.380> go<00:02:28.380> ahead<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.590> flip

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
you've got those off go ahead and flip

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.040 
you've got those off go ahead and flip
it<00:02:28.830> over<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.130> get<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.240> entire<00:02:30.510> block<00:02:30.780> here

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
it over and get the entire block here

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.650 
it over and get the entire block here
and<00:02:31.880> for<00:02:32.880> those<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.209> may<00:02:33.300> not<00:02:33.450> have<00:02:33.540> ever

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
and for those you can may not have ever

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.990 
and for those you can may not have ever
seen<00:02:33.870> one<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.020> these<00:02:34.110> before<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:35.970> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
seen one of these before this is the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.400 
seen one of these before this is the
difference<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:38.330> right<00:02:39.330> there<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:39.959> believe

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
difference that right there and believe

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.800 
difference that right there and believe
me<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.680> does<00:02:40.860> make<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.070> huge<00:02:41.190> difference<00:02:41.910> in

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
me it does make a huge difference in

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.940 
me it does make a huge difference in
tone<00:02:44.959> again<00:02:45.959> this<00:02:46.110> is<00:02:46.290> one<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.590> steps<00:02:46.830> you

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
tone again this is one of the steps you

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.710 
tone again this is one of the steps you
can<00:02:47.160> skip<00:02:47.840> but<00:02:48.840> I'm<00:02:48.989> just<00:02:49.080> go<00:02:49.320> ahead<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.590> do<00:02:49.739> it

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
can skip but I'm just go ahead and do it

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.460 
can skip but I'm just go ahead and do it
because<00:02:51.720> it<00:02:51.959> does<00:02:52.050> make<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.320> whole<00:02:52.350> thing

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
because it does make the whole thing

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.040 
because it does make the whole thing
easier<00:02:53.330> but<00:02:54.330> if<00:02:54.420> you<00:02:54.510> are<00:02:54.630> pressed<00:02:54.870> for<00:02:55.019> time

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
easier but if you are pressed for time

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.130 
easier but if you are pressed for time
what<00:02:55.440> you<00:02:55.530> could<00:02:55.769> do<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.780> take<00:02:57.780> one<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:58.050> these

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
what you could do is take one of these

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.780 
what you could do is take one of these
things<00:02:58.410> kind<00:02:58.620> of<00:02:58.739> tilt<00:02:58.920> it<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.100> the<00:02:59.220> side<00:02:59.459> and

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
things kind of tilt it on the side and

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.120 
things kind of tilt it on the side and
then<00:03:00.540> just<00:03:00.570> work<00:03:00.959> your<00:03:01.110> screwdriver<00:03:01.590> in<00:03:01.860> there

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
then just work your screwdriver in there

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.250 
then just work your screwdriver in there
it'll<00:03:02.519> be<00:03:02.610> kind<00:03:02.820> of<00:03:02.910> hard<00:03:03.090> but<00:03:03.239> you<00:03:03.360> can<00:03:03.570> you

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
it'll be kind of hard but you can you

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.900 
it'll be kind of hard but you can you
can<00:03:04.410> do<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:04.739> though<00:03:04.950> if<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.370> monkey<00:03:05.640> roll<00:03:05.790> it

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
can do it though if you monkey roll it

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:17.640 
can do it though if you monkey roll it
enough

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.750 

all<00:03:18.650> right<00:03:18.830> now<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.069> want<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.400> do<00:03:19.490> is<00:03:19.610> make

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
all right now you want to do is make

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.720 
all right now you want to do is make
sure<00:03:19.790> that<00:03:19.940> all<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.240> holes<00:03:20.480> are<00:03:20.660> lined<00:03:20.720> up

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
sure that all the holes are lined up

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.760 
sure that all the holes are lined up
which<00:03:22.730> as<00:03:23.030> you<00:03:23.330> can<00:03:23.360> see<00:03:25.990> they<00:03:26.990> certainly<00:03:27.440> are

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
which as you can see they certainly are

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.250 
which as you can see they certainly are
and<00:03:28.520> then<00:03:29.030> from<00:03:29.150> this<00:03:29.270> point<00:03:29.360> on<00:03:29.630> all<00:03:29.660> it<00:03:29.930> is<00:03:30.050> is

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
and then from this point on all it is is

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.480 
and then from this point on all it is is
just<00:03:30.440> putting<00:03:30.680> all<00:03:30.800> the<00:03:30.890> screws<00:03:31.130> back<00:03:31.280> in

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:31.490 
just putting all the screws back in

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:36.610 
just putting all the screws back in
place<00:03:31.959> it's<00:03:32.959> really<00:03:33.350> quite<00:03:33.590> simple<00:03:35.410> as<00:03:36.410> you

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
place it's really quite simple as you

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.320 
place it's really quite simple as you
