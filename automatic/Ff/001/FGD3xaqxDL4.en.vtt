00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 entrance to the track is still closed well our 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.029
 the crew of the company 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.919
 autobahn allowed to drive on a new 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.440
 cut the road and look at 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.790
 work results 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.540
 I confess to drive a great wide 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.070
 highways 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.949
 where besides you have no more soul 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.260
 feeling quite unusual but soon everything 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.210
 change the track is filled with cars 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.990
 and roads within the city of Bronnitsy 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.220
 on the contrary, finally a little unload 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.650
 government contracts were determined to complete 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.599
 construction until the end of this year however 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.740
 builders assure that even cope 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.770
 earlier than planned 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.630
 will publish the object in October road 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.180
 canvas throughout the length of the length 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.800
 about 12 kilometers almost ready 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.809
 already done work on 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.770
 landscaping and installed 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.960
 road signs 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.030
 all this suggests that the builders 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.280
 really have every chance to finish 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.739
 work on time for today 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.430
 The acceptance commission is already starting. 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:58.710
 from September 15 in full swing 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.989
 final preparations for the object 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.329
 into operation 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:06.140
 on the assurances of our respected builders 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.830
 road must run 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:12.299
 switch traffic on the new road 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:14.490
 starting October 15 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.040
 if there is no force majeure 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.790
 situations and the road will be taken full 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.409
 the amount of work is completed and we hope very 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.170
 we expect that finally 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.259
 Bronnitsa city as I always say 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.540
 sigh due to the fact that we will leave 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.320
 large flow at least cargo 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.259
 of transport 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.079
 and the connection with the discovery of this this road 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.150
 This stage is a detour around 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.530
 Bronnitsy began to lay in the beginning 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.930
 2011 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.740
 first built a T-junction 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.140
 intersection 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.000
 the first starting complex is his road 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.130
 passed on time and now motorists them 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.720
 successfully uses the second stage 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.939
 construction of a bypass road along the row 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.720
 of reasons he dragged on but now he too 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.550
 nearing completion 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.260
 connect with the federal highway m-5 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.100
 Ural bypass will be in the area 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.990
 Tatarintsev 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.270
 and here unfortunately not without 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.360
 fly in the ointment 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.840
 notice that closer to departure 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.630
 four lane bypass 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.550
 narrows to two bands like 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.430
 design decision caused skepticism and 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.940
 reviews from many motorists 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:22.510
 it is assumed yes may not be 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:25.240
 cozy not very thoughtful so probably 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.550
 also need to say wrong but life 

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.370
 show means not immediately you can do everything 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.200
 because it is to do the third stage 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.200
 which should go out directly 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.100
 already on the bypass 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.340
 where is kolomna yes it is enough 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.100
 expensive 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.430
 project national scale therefore 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:46.230
 today departure and will be in 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.500
 Tatarintsev 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:53.820
 the exit will be at 90 degrees it will be 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.620
 main road without turning left with 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.480
 this road to the left will not be able to leave 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.970
 on the Ryazan highway it is only necessary 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.680
 drive will turn right and into 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.750
 this in the opposite direction of the city 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.120
 bromine thread that 's the builders assurance that 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.820
 Once again, this will be the main 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.500
 road with a turn of 90 degrees to exit 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:18.850
 on the new ryazan on the ryazan highway 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.459
 realize with traffic lights economy 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.830
 which will regulate 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:26.290
 there will surely be some kind of water 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:30.160
 inconvenience due to the fact that there is still 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.320
 narrowing of the traffic lights but the most 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:35.230
 the main thing is the main problem 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:37.900
 which is now in the city and for the sake of 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.760
 of which this road was made 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.799
 bypass 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.720
 beyond the city of Bronnitsy here for others 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.830
 settlements villages that go 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.200
 steam of Minsk region 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:49.269
 it will perform the function that is 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.790
 unload our roads diverge our 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.739
 traffic lights our urban crossroads 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.140
 road safety will rise 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:58.690
 movements and 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.060
 we will feel completely on ourselves in 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.040
 some measure the absence of such a mass 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.200
 road transport well including 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:07.720
 and heavy and of course the usual 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.230
 passenger Michael luggage Alexander 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.310
