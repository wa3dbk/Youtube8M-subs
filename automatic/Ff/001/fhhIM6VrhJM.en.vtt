and<00:00:18.900> I'm<00:00:19.650> going<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.859> add<00:00:19.920> some<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.340> our<00:00:20.520> malt

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
and I'm going to add some of our malt

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.670 
and I'm going to add some of our malt
extract<00:00:21.210> first<00:00:21.720> we're<00:00:21.960> going<00:00:22.050> to<00:00:22.170> take<00:00:22.380> our

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
extract first we're going to take our

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.080 
extract first we're going to take our
kettle<00:00:23.189> off<00:00:23.519> the<00:00:23.789> main<00:00:23.970> heat<00:00:25.609> then<00:00:26.609> we're

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
kettle off the main heat then we're

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.550

going<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.240> take<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.570> malt<00:00:27.779> extract<00:00:28.199> which<00:00:28.410> has

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
going to take the malt extract which has

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.999 
going to take the malt extract which has
been<00:00:28.710> soaking<00:00:28.980> in<00:00:29.340> hot<00:00:29.400> water<00:00:30.800> start<00:00:31.800> mixing

been soaking in hot water start mixing
it<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:34.309> very<00:00:35.309> nice<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.760> slowly<00:00:39.620> trying<00:00:40.620> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
it in very nice and slowly trying to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.060 
it in very nice and slowly trying to
make<00:00:40.890> sure<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.250> it<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.430> gets<00:00:41.760> blended<00:00:42.000> in

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
make sure that it all gets blended in

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.950 
make sure that it all gets blended in
now<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.430> tip<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.850> you<00:00:45.030> may<00:00:45.239> not<00:00:45.390> get<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.629> lot<00:00:45.899> of

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
now a tip that you may not get a lot of

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.340 
now a tip that you may not get a lot of
other<00:00:46.230> brew<00:00:46.530> starters<00:00:46.850> is<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:48.719> you<00:00:49.140> don't

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
other brew starters is that you don't

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.619 
other brew starters is that you don't
actually<00:00:49.710> want<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> add<00:00:50.280> all<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.640> multi<00:00:51.329> start

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
actually want to add all to multi start

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.260 
actually want to add all to multi start
right<00:00:51.989> now<00:00:52.520> instead<00:00:53.520> we're<00:00:53.879> going<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.090> add

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
right now instead we're going to add

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.139 
right now instead we're going to add
roughly<00:00:54.840> half<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:56.250> two-thirds<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:57.030> the

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
roughly half to two-thirds of the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.750 
roughly half to two-thirds of the
extract<00:00:57.629> what<00:00:58.530> this<00:00:58.710> will<00:00:58.890> prevent<00:00:59.219> is<00:00:59.550> some

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
extract what this will prevent is some

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.250 
extract what this will prevent is some
of<00:00:59.850> the<00:00:59.910> carnally<00:01:00.420> flavors<00:01:00.899> which<00:01:01.109> are

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
of the carnally flavors which are

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.640 
of the carnally flavors which are
associated<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:02.039> extract<00:01:02.910> brewing<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:04.379> rest

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
associated with extract brewing the rest

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
process you want to continually stir to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.859 
process you want to continually stir to
make<00:01:14.939> sure<00:01:15.119> everything<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.689> all<00:01:15.840> mixed

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
together and that none of it is going to

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.249 
together and that none of it is going to
be<00:01:17.790> left<00:01:17.970> on<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.240> bottom<00:01:18.540> in<00:01:18.810> order<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.170> scorch

that<00:01:34.590> while<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.189> boiling<00:01:35.400> you<00:01:35.729> want<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:36.030> add

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
that while it's boiling you want to add

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.880 
that while it's boiling you want to add

that beforehand or else it will clump

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.770 
that beforehand or else it will clump
heavily<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.759> it'll<00:01:38.790> be<00:01:39.030> very<00:01:39.210> hard<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.600> break

in<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> solution<00:01:40.470> as<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.670> can<00:01:41.790> see<00:01:41.970> we're

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
in the solution as you can see we're

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.789 
in the solution as you can see we're
getting<00:01:42.270> nice<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.630> close<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.200> boil<00:01:43.380> you

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
getting nice and close to the boil you

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.990 
getting nice and close to the boil you
can<00:01:43.950> actually<00:01:44.100> see<00:01:44.280> some<00:01:44.610> of<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.790> first

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
can actually see some of the first

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.700 
can actually see some of the first
bubbles<00:01:45.450> starting<00:01:45.689> to<00:01:45.840> come<00:01:45.990> up<00:01:47.750> at<00:01:48.750> this

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
bubbles starting to come up at this

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.139 
bubbles starting to come up at this
point<00:01:49.950> it's<00:01:50.100> going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.340> very<00:01:50.399> important<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
point it's going to be very important to

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.030 
point it's going to be very important to
start<00:01:51.390> controlling<00:01:52.079> your<00:01:52.259> temperature<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
start controlling your temperature you

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.870 
start controlling your temperature you
don't<00:01:53.310> want<00:01:53.520> to<00:01:53.610> boil<00:01:53.759> over

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
temperature and turn down your heat and

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:11.110 
temperature and turn down your heat and
give<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.539> shows<00:02:05.810> again<00:02:09.640> now<00:02:10.640> we're<00:02:10.819> getting<00:02:10.910> in

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 
give it shows again now we're getting in

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.949 
give it shows again now we're getting in
a<00:02:11.239> nice<00:02:11.569> boil<00:02:11.930> here<00:02:13.000> we<00:02:14.000> want<00:02:14.239> to<00:02:14.360> turn<00:02:14.930> down

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
a nice boil here we want to turn down

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:17.470 
a nice boil here we want to turn down
our<00:02:15.319> heat<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.099> we<00:02:16.310> don't<00:02:16.519> reach<00:02:17.000> any<00:02:17.239> high

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
our heat so that we don't reach any high

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.440 
our heat so that we don't reach any high
levels<00:02:19.959> it's<00:02:20.959> going<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.200> foam<00:02:21.380> up<00:02:22.420> both<00:02:23.420> a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
levels it's going to foam up both a

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.059 
levels it's going to foam up both a
little<00:02:23.750> temperature<00:02:24.230> management<00:02:24.380> you<00:02:24.890> should

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:25.069 
little temperature management you should

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:27.580 
little temperature management you should
be<00:02:25.250> okay
