00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.949 
our raw veggies for the week a lot of
people<00:04:16.669> think<00:04:16.880> that<00:04:17.000> this<00:04:17.209> is<00:04:17.359> a<00:04:17.390> step<00:04:17.690> you<00:04:17.720> can

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959

skip<00:04:18.229> but<00:04:18.680> for<00:04:18.890> me<00:04:19.010> it's<00:04:19.280> really<00:04:19.519> important<00:04:20.060> to

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:20.120 
skip but for me it's really important to

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.610 
skip but for me it's really important to
have<00:04:20.209> raw<00:04:20.419> veggies<00:04:20.780> on<00:04:20.900> hand<00:04:21.140> when<00:04:21.289> I'm<00:04:21.380> having
