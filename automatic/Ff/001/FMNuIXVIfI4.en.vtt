00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.330
 video so this will be a video recipes I 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.150
 will show you how I do my 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.890
 Russian salad so that's the real one I do not 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.559
 know what is because in 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.170
 turkish said american salat to fire and in 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.090
 France we say Russian salad so if you 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.330
 you know exactly the name of this 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:45.660
 salad leave - the name in comment 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.879
 I would be delighted so let's go first 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.920
 I cooked my potato 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.379
 rally are cooked I'm going to come and take off 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.379
 the skin and I 'm doing rossine but they 

00:00:54.830 --> 00:01:00.089
 and I'm going to wash my peas 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.430
 and carrots I'm going to separate them and 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.780
 especially carrots because we 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.129
 will cut into small pieces 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.129
 so I mean right now 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.150
 that I just cut into small dice 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:19.290
 but they like this so if you cut yourself 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.710
 in slices your pickles you cut 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.450
 in square squares or slices 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.640
 that's when you want but you have to 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.070
 it was a little bit I was still 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.750
 new piece of land 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.580
 then my carrots I cut in 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.720
 washers 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:38.130
 I had my peas here 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.230
 as well as my carrots 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.330
 by cons if you want to 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.250
 boil a 40 with peas ya 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.680
 no worries but at the same canned 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:50.970
 this is super good like there is no 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:58.920
 flaw so I just pour the whole thing 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:02:06.810
 in a big salad bowl the inverted my 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:09.660
 carrots and my little peas you've seen 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:13.940
 it's super easy not much 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:20.400
 of ingredients and economical and stuffy 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:22.709
 then I add a little salt here 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.650
 then add some mayonnaise 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:28.550
 so I take lightly for the 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.980
 digestion is this term 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:40.820
 about 136 g I'm going to put for 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:40.820
 the moment half here 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.920
 the mixture is a first time 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.709
 so that's so I like and more of the 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.120
 half of mayonnaise a snack so if 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.010
 you see there is not enough mayonnaise 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.090
 added in May it is not necessary that it is 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.430
 drowns in mayonnaise be careful 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:07.770
 so there I mean put my salad 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:15.390
 in a clean dish to make a 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:23.670
 nice presentation and come cut some 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:26.970
 pickles in length like this julien 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.950
 ask them that here is the 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.840
 result of my Russian salad so 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.130
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.019

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.019
