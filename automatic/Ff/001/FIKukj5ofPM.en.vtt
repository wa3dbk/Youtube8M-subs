00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
I found a spot she's actually got a

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.849 
I found a spot she's actually got a
church<00:00:19.250> with<00:00:20.250> a<00:00:20.760> big-ass<00:00:21.600> empty<00:00:22.410> parking<00:00:22.650> lot

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
church with a big-ass empty parking lot

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.099 
church with a big-ass empty parking lot
and<00:00:23.189> was<00:00:23.550> perfect<00:00:24.000> but<00:00:24.630> I<00:00:24.660> actually<00:00:24.840> have<00:00:25.080> a

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
and was perfect but I actually have a

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.980 
and was perfect but I actually have a
couple<00:00:25.230> more<00:00:25.500> places<00:00:25.680> in<00:00:26.070> mind<00:00:26.310> where<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.689> can

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
couple more places in mind where I can

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.560 
couple more places in mind where I can
do<00:00:28.140> it<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.560> think<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.550> car<00:00:29.849> pushing<00:00:30.390> and

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
do it so I think the car pushing and

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.749 
do it so I think the car pushing and
pulling<00:00:30.900> is<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.520> go

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
pulling is a go

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.420 
pulling is a go
I<00:00:32.790> don't<00:00:33.149> think<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.360> have<00:00:33.510> any<00:00:33.660> more<00:00:33.809> issues

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
I don't think I have any more issues

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.709 
I don't think I have any more issues
with<00:00:35.430> getting<00:00:35.820> kicked<00:00:36.149> out<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.360> parking<00:00:36.630> lots

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
never do because I'm always backed up

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.360 
never do because I'm always backed up
with<00:02:17.630> clients<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:18.140> I'd<00:02:18.440> never<00:02:18.620> have<00:02:18.830> offer<00:02:19.130> any

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
with clients so I'd never have offer any

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.400 
with clients so I'd never have offer any
discounts<00:02:19.910> but<00:02:20.390> I<00:02:20.420> have<00:02:20.540> actually<00:02:20.780> offered<00:02:21.140> a

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
discounts but I have actually offered a

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.040

few discounts on through this newsletter

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.810 
few discounts on through this newsletter
so<00:02:24.410> I<00:02:24.470> think<00:02:24.560> it's<00:02:25.160> gonna<00:02:25.370> be<00:02:25.520> worth<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.760> for
