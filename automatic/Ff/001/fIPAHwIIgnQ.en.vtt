on<00:01:48.210> not<00:01:48.480> only<00:01:48.750> for<00:01:48.960> better<00:01:49.110> accuracy<00:01:49.440> but<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
on not only for better accuracy but the

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.830 
on not only for better accuracy but the
thing<00:01:50.190> about<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.730> is<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.030> iron<00:01:51.240> tyke<00:01:51.570> is

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
thing about it is is the iron tyke is

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.750 
thing about it is is the iron tyke is
kind<00:01:52.140> of<00:01:52.230> like<00:01:52.290> that<00:01:52.470> m60<00:01:53.040> from<00:01:53.190> call<00:01:53.430> of<00:01:53.460> duty

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
kind of like that m60 from call of duty

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.640 
kind of like that m60 from call of duty
for<00:01:54.000> you<00:01:54.450> guys<00:01:54.630> ever<00:01:54.840> play<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.470> iron

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
for you guys ever play that the iron

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.460 
for you guys ever play that the iron
sight<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.070> completely<00:01:56.760> horrible<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.570> does<00:01:58.200> not

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.050 
sight is completely horrible it does not
work<00:01:58.710> out<00:01:58.890> so<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.190> definitely<00:01:59.460> need<00:01:59.790> a<00:01:59.820> red

dot<00:02:00.270> sight<00:02:00.540> next<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.410> recommend<00:02:01.830> using<00:02:01.980> the

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.160 
dot sight next I recommend using the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.490 
dot sight next I recommend using the
heat<00:02:02.370> sink<00:02:02.610> because<00:02:03.060> it<00:02:03.330> extends<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.050> firing

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
heat sink because it extends the firing

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.740 
heat sink because it extends the firing
time<00:02:04.740> before<00:02:05.250> overheating<00:02:05.909> because<00:02:06.270> this<00:02:06.570> is

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
time before overheating because this is

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.509 
time before overheating because this is
a<00:02:06.780> direct<00:02:07.110> energy<00:02:07.470> weapon<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> really

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:08.519 
a direct energy weapon so the really

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.759 
a direct energy weapon so the really
great<00:02:08.640> thing<00:02:08.909> about<00:02:09.030> it<00:02:09.360> is<00:02:09.509> you<00:02:09.780> never<00:02:10.349> run

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
great thing about it is you never run

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.399 
great thing about it is you never run
out<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:10.950> ammo<00:02:11.459> unless<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.330> completely<00:02:13.019> shoot

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
out of ammo unless you completely shoot

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.740 
out of ammo unless you completely shoot
it<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.800> you<00:02:14.400> keep<00:02:14.700> shooting<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:15.510> don't

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
it and you keep shooting and you don't

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.740 
it and you keep shooting and you don't
stop<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.349> then<00:02:16.440> you'll<00:02:16.620> eventually<00:02:16.860> have<00:02:17.310> to

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
stop and then you'll eventually have to

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.350 
stop and then you'll eventually have to
let<00:02:18.750> it<00:02:18.900> out<00:02:19.050> and<00:02:19.379> add<00:02:19.700> push<00:02:20.700> something<00:02:21.030> back

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
let it out and add push something back

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.750 
let it out and add push something back
in<00:02:21.599> just<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.440> motor<00:02:22.920> or<00:02:23.220> something<00:02:23.430> like<00:02:23.700> that

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
in just the motor or something like that

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.640 
in just the motor or something like that
because<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.180> overheats<00:02:24.930> and<00:02:25.110> it<00:02:25.230> doesn't<00:02:25.530> work

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
because it overheats and it doesn't work

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.250 
because it overheats and it doesn't work
out<00:02:25.830> next<00:02:26.700> you<00:02:26.909> want<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.180> use<00:02:27.269> for<00:02:27.569> grip<00:02:27.810> just

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
out next you want to use for grip just

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.220 
out next you want to use for grip just
for<00:02:28.439> reduce<00:02:28.709> recoil<00:02:29.040> reduce<00:02:29.999> vehicle<00:02:30.359> recoil

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
for reduce recoil reduce vehicle recoil

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.140 
for reduce recoil reduce vehicle recoil
and<00:02:31.439> like<00:02:32.129> I<00:02:32.249> said<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.609> is<00:02:32.760> a

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
and like I said it is a

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.819 
and like I said it is a
back<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.329> energy<00:02:33.599> weapons<00:02:33.959> so<00:02:34.140> it<00:02:34.230> does<00:02:34.439> end<00:02:34.709> up

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
back to energy weapons so it does end up

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.100 
back to energy weapons so it does end up
going<00:02:35.250> upward<00:02:35.670> when<00:02:36.209> you're<00:02:36.390> shooting<00:02:36.599> this

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
going upward when you're shooting this

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.069 
going upward when you're shooting this
gun<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.620> lot<00:02:38.280> so<00:02:38.670> now<00:02:39.150> let's<00:02:39.420> jump<00:02:39.720> right<00:02:39.810> into

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
gun a lot so now let's jump right into

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.170 
gun a lot so now let's jump right into
the<00:02:40.230> perks<00:02:40.560> guys<00:02:40.829> as<00:02:41.069> far<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.489> perks<00:02:41.730> co<00:02:41.970> I

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
the perks guys as far as the perks co I

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.270 
the perks guys as far as the perks co I
recommend<00:02:42.689> using<00:02:42.870> in<00:02:43.140> perk<00:02:43.439> slot<00:02:43.590> 1<00:02:43.920> low

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
recommend using in perk slot 1 low

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.550 
recommend using in perk slot 1 low
profile<00:02:44.760> and<00:02:44.970> lightweight<00:02:45.420> low<00:02:45.870> profile<00:02:46.319> is

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
profile and lightweight low profile is

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.410 
profile and lightweight low profile is
always<00:02:47.040> great<00:02:47.310> invisible<00:02:47.909> to<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.120> IVs

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
always great invisible to you IVs

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
tracking rounds and XO ping which is

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.940 
tracking rounds and XO ping which is
really<00:02:51.000> important<00:02:51.450> and<00:02:51.569> then<00:02:51.930> lightweight<00:02:52.500> so

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
really important and then lightweight so

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.550 
really important and then lightweight so
since<00:02:53.340> you<00:02:53.549> have<00:02:53.849> a<00:02:54.150> two-point<00:02:55.019> increase<00:02:55.379> in

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
since you have a two-point increase in

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.069 
since you have a two-point increase in
mobility<00:02:55.859> with<00:02:56.579> this<00:02:56.790> gun<00:02:57.000> overall<00:02:57.329> with

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
mobility with this gun overall with

00:02:58.079 --> 00:02:59.750 
mobility with this gun overall with
lightweight<00:02:58.439> it<00:02:58.859> allows<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.370> run<00:02:59.519> around

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
lightweight it allows you to run around

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.940 
lightweight it allows you to run around
a<00:02:59.849> lot<00:03:00.120> faster<00:03:00.420> and<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:00.959> makes<00:03:01.170> it<00:03:01.349> feel<00:03:01.560> kind

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
a lot faster and it makes it feel kind

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.890 
a lot faster and it makes it feel kind
of<00:03:02.040> like<00:03:02.220> you're<00:03:02.370> using<00:03:02.750> astonishing<00:03:03.750> on

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
of like you're using astonishing on

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.660 
of like you're using astonishing on
which<00:03:04.049> is<00:03:04.200> really<00:03:04.470> really<00:03:04.650> great<00:03:04.829> next<00:03:05.609> I

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
which is really really great next I

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.520 
which is really really great next I
recommend<00:03:06.060> using<00:03:06.209> peripherals<00:03:06.840> increase<00:03:07.349> the

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
recommend using peripherals increase the

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.229 
recommend using peripherals increase the
mini-map<00:03:07.829> coverage<00:03:08.280> take<00:03:08.790> our<00:03:08.909> enemies

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
mini-map coverage take our enemies

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.149 
mini-map coverage take our enemies
without<00:03:09.389> displaying<00:03:09.870> their<00:03:10.170> death<00:03:10.470> location

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:11.159 
without displaying their death location

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.250 
without displaying their death location
so<00:03:11.310> this<00:03:11.489> is<00:03:11.639> really<00:03:11.849> really<00:03:12.120> helpful<00:03:12.359> as<00:03:12.629> well

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
so this is really really helpful as well

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.649 
so this is really really helpful as well
definitely<00:03:14.040> recommend<00:03:14.489> using<00:03:14.790> peripherals

00:03:15.649 --> 00:03:15.659 
definitely recommend using peripherals

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.229 
definitely recommend using peripherals
now<00:03:16.109> normally<00:03:16.620> in<00:03:16.829> my<00:03:16.980> perk<00:03:17.250> slot<00:03:17.400> threes<00:03:17.909> I

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
now normally in my perk slot threes I

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.869 
now normally in my perk slot threes I
would<00:03:18.599> usually<00:03:19.200> use<00:03:19.739> blast<00:03:20.129> suppressor<00:03:20.340> and

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
would usually use blast suppressor and

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.030 
would usually use blast suppressor and
scavenger<00:03:21.569> but<00:03:21.930> since<00:03:22.200> this<00:03:22.319> gun<00:03:22.560> does<00:03:22.769> not

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
scavenger but since this gun does not

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.520 
scavenger but since this gun does not
have<00:03:23.430> a<00:03:23.760> mo<00:03:23.970> it<00:03:24.359> replenishes<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:25.200> same<00:03:25.409> oh

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
have a mo it replenishes the same oh

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.039 
have a mo it replenishes the same oh
it's<00:03:25.739> pretty<00:03:26.220> much<00:03:26.400> unlimited<00:03:26.939> ammo<00:03:27.569> you

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
it's pretty much unlimited ammo you

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.599 
it's pretty much unlimited ammo you
don't<00:03:28.349> need<00:03:28.470> scavenger<00:03:29.040> which<00:03:29.189> is<00:03:29.340> really

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
don't need scavenger which is really

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.220 
don't need scavenger which is really
great<00:03:29.879> and<00:03:30.060> you<00:03:30.450> can<00:03:30.599> use<00:03:30.750> blast<00:03:31.079> suppressor

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
great and you can use blast suppressor

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.500 
great and you can use blast suppressor
and<00:03:31.620> toughness<00:03:32.069> so<00:03:32.519> blasted<00:03:32.790> pressure<00:03:33.150> makes

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
and toughness so blasted pressure makes

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.000 
and toughness so blasted pressure makes
you<00:03:33.629> invisible<00:03:33.989> on<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:34.500> mini-map<00:03:34.709> when

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
you invisible on the mini-map when

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.729 
you invisible on the mini-map when
performing<00:03:35.519> XO<00:03:35.909> moves<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.480> then<00:03:37.019> toughness

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
performing XO moves and then toughness

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.610 
performing XO moves and then toughness
you<00:03:38.310> get<00:03:38.519> less<00:03:38.879> flinch<00:03:39.299> when<00:03:39.540> you're<00:03:39.959> shot<00:03:40.260> so

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
you get less flinch when you're shot so

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.110 
you get less flinch when you're shot so
it<00:03:40.680> allows<00:03:40.889> you<00:03:41.040> to<00:03:41.129> be<00:03:41.250> more<00:03:41.430> accurate<00:03:41.669> and

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
it allows you to be more accurate and

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.839 
it allows you to be more accurate and
precise<00:03:42.959> with<00:03:43.230> your<00:03:43.290> shots<00:03:43.769> now<00:03:44.250> overall<00:03:44.519> guys

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
precise with your shots now overall guys

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:46.460 
precise with your shots now overall guys
you're<00:03:45.060> going<00:03:45.180> to<00:03:45.239> have<00:03:45.359> one<00:03:45.660> point<00:03:45.930> left<00:03:46.230> and

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
you're going to have one point left and

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.979 
you're going to have one point left and
you<00:03:46.739> can<00:03:46.919> use<00:03:47.099> that<00:03:47.280> on<00:03:47.549> either<00:03:47.879> a<00:03:48.030> frag<00:03:48.599> or<00:03:48.959> a

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:48.989 
you can use that on either a frag or a

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:51.589 
you can use that on either a frag or a
UAV<00:03:49.500> or<00:03:49.829> something<00:03:50.099> like<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.250> I<00:03:50.699> personally

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:51.599 
UAV or something like that I personally

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:53.449 
UAV or something like that I personally
have<00:03:51.780> not<00:03:51.959> been<00:03:52.199> using<00:03:52.560> scorestreaks<00:03:53.099> lately

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
have not been using scorestreaks lately

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.520 
have not been using scorestreaks lately
and<00:03:53.819> I<00:03:53.970> find<00:03:54.209> that<00:03:54.269> it<00:03:54.480> ends<00:03:54.900> up<00:03:55.019> working<00:03:55.230> out<00:03:55.470> a

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
and I find that it ends up working out a

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.140 
and I find that it ends up working out a
lot<00:03:55.650> better<00:03:56.010> i<00:03:56.250> feel<00:03:56.459> like<00:03:56.579> the<00:03:56.699> classes<00:03:57.120> that

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
lot better i feel like the classes that

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.240 
lot better i feel like the classes that
i<00:03:57.239> use<00:03:57.510> are<00:03:57.750> definitely<00:03:58.409> more<00:03:58.530> effective<00:03:59.069> the

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
i use are definitely more effective the

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:00.649 
i use are definitely more effective the
guns<00:03:59.489> are<00:03:59.609> more<00:03:59.790> effective<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:00.329> things<00:04:00.540> like

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
guns are more effective and things like

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.899 
guns are more effective and things like
that<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:01.139> news<00:04:01.680> guys<00:04:01.919> let's<00:04:02.280> get<00:04:02.459> into<00:04:02.639> the

00:04:02.899 --> 00:04:02.909 
that so news guys let's get into the

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:04.460 
that so news guys let's get into the
five<00:04:03.180> questions<00:04:03.629> in<00:04:03.780> the<00:04:03.840> answer<00:04:04.139> in<00:04:04.199> every

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
five questions in the answer in every

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.349 
five questions in the answer in every
single<00:04:04.739> episode<00:04:04.829> of<00:04:05.220> this<00:04:05.370> series<00:04:05.639> first

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
single episode of this series first

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.360 
single episode of this series first
question<00:04:06.720> is<00:04:06.840> is<00:04:07.079> this<00:04:07.229> design<00:04:07.590> for<00:04:07.620> coloring

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
question is is this design for coloring

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.460 
question is is this design for coloring
agents<00:04:08.790> long<00:04:09.180> range<00:04:09.389> engagements<00:04:09.629> or<00:04:10.139> medium

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
agents long range engagements or medium

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.990 
agents long range engagements or medium
range<00:04:10.650> occasions<00:04:11.129> and<00:04:11.459> how<00:04:11.579> does<00:04:11.639> it<00:04:11.819> perform

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
range occasions and how does it perform

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.909 
range occasions and how does it perform
in<00:04:12.329> each<00:04:12.479> so<00:04:12.959> this<00:04:13.139> gun<00:04:13.349> is<00:04:13.379> definitely

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:13.919 
in each so this gun is definitely

00:04:13.919 --> 00:04:16.009 
in each so this gun is definitely
designed<00:04:14.220> for<00:04:14.430> medium<00:04:14.819> range<00:04:15.030> engagements<00:04:15.269> it

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
designed for medium range engagements it

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:18.379 
designed for medium range engagements it
does<00:04:16.260> have<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.769> one<00:04:17.099> point<00:04:17.280> decrease<00:04:17.880> in<00:04:18.060> range

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:18.389 
does have a one point decrease in range

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:20.479 
does have a one point decrease in range
which<00:04:18.930> makes<00:04:19.169> it<00:04:19.320> not<00:04:19.500> as<00:04:19.739> effective<00:04:20.310> in

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
which makes it not as effective in

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.120 
which makes it not as effective in
long-range<00:04:21.109> situations<00:04:22.109> but<00:04:22.620> you<00:04:22.710> still<00:04:22.770> can

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
long-range situations but you still can

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.920 
long-range situations but you still can
get<00:04:23.280> some<00:04:23.460> long-range<00:04:23.669> shots<00:04:24.090> off<00:04:24.330> and<00:04:24.570> of

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
get some long-range shots off and of

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.779 
get some long-range shots off and of
course<00:04:24.960> in<00:04:25.530> the<00:04:25.680> close-quarter<00:04:26.220> engagements

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:26.789 
course in the close-quarter engagements

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:28.580 
course in the close-quarter engagements
you<00:04:27.090> can<00:04:27.270> still<00:04:27.539> get<00:04:27.659> some<00:04:27.900> kills<00:04:28.110> I<00:04:28.320> mean<00:04:28.470> it's

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
you can still get some kills I mean it's

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.620 
you can still get some kills I mean it's
not<00:04:28.770> going<00:04:28.919> to<00:04:29.010> be<00:04:29.070> completely<00:04:29.669> terrible<00:04:30.090> you

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
not going to be completely terrible you

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.300 
not going to be completely terrible you
still<00:04:30.960> will<00:04:31.139> be<00:04:31.289> able<00:04:31.349> to<00:04:31.500> get<00:04:31.680> shots<00:04:31.949> the<00:04:32.099> only

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
still will be able to get shots the only

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.580 
still will be able to get shots the only
thing<00:04:32.460> about<00:04:32.669> it<00:04:32.880> is<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.449> ABS<00:04:33.930> time<00:04:34.199> is<00:04:34.409> not

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
thing about it is the ABS time is not

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.890 
thing about it is the ABS time is not
super<00:04:34.919> fast<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:35.880> might<00:04:36.060> want<00:04:36.419> to<00:04:36.510> put<00:04:36.870> on

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
super fast so you might want to put on

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.379 
super fast so you might want to put on
quick<00:04:37.380> draw<00:04:37.590> instead<00:04:38.220> and<00:04:38.460> then<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.000> make<00:04:39.150> it<00:04:39.330> a

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
quick draw instead and then I make it a

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:40.060 
quick draw instead and then I make it a
little<00:04:39.539> bit<00:04:39.720> better

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
little bit better

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.670 
little bit better

to perform pretty well you can really

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:53.560 
to perform pretty well you can really
lock<00:04:52.100> down<00:04:52.340> those<00:04:52.580> long<00:04:52.880> lines<00:04:53.090> a<00:04:53.240> set<00:04:53.450> with

number<00:04:55.910> three<00:04:56.210> what<00:04:56.360> is<00:04:56.480> the<00:04:56.600> best<00:04:56.840> and<00:04:57.050> worst

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:57.230 
number three what is the best and worst

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.690 
number three what is the best and worst
feature<00:04:57.470> out<00:04:57.650> the<00:04:57.770> sconce<00:04:58.040> the<00:04:58.250> best<00:04:58.460> feature

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
feature out the sconce the best feature

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.820 
feature out the sconce the best feature
is<00:04:58.970> definitely<00:04:59.660> the<00:04:59.780> damage<00:05:00.200> increase<00:05:00.560> in<00:05:00.710> the

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
is definitely the damage increase in the

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.680 
is definitely the damage increase in the
mobility<00:05:01.370> and<00:05:01.700> the<00:05:01.820> worst<00:05:02.060> feature<00:05:02.360> is<00:05:02.660> the

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
mobility and the worst feature is the

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.690 
mobility and the worst feature is the
decrease<00:05:03.230> in<00:05:03.380> handling<00:05:03.770> at<00:05:04.130> a<00:05:04.190> decrease<00:05:04.670> in

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
decrease in handling at a decrease in

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.450 
decrease in handling at a decrease in
range<00:05:05.180> not<00:05:05.660> really<00:05:05.870> too<00:05:06.080> too<00:05:06.230> bad<00:05:06.440> and<00:05:06.740> another

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
range not really too too bad and another

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.040 
range not really too too bad and another
