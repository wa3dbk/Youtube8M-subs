top for the 45s I've got this little
thing<00:00:58.659> from<00:00:58.869> Odyssey<00:00:59.320> and<00:00:59.710> what<00:01:00.430> it<00:01:00.549> does<00:01:00.790> is

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:01.119 
thing from Odyssey and what it does is

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:04.649 
thing from Odyssey and what it does is
holds<00:01:01.930> three<00:01:02.369> different<00:01:03.369> sections<00:01:03.939> for<00:01:04.540> all

holds three different sections for all

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.220 
holds three different sections for all
your<00:01:04.809> 45s<00:01:05.320> I<00:01:05.500> think<00:01:05.680> it<00:01:05.770> holds<00:01:06.070> up<00:01:06.189> to<00:01:07.020> 150<00:01:08.020> or

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
your 45s I think it holds up to 150 or

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.130 
your 45s I think it holds up to 150 or
200<00:01:08.890> so<00:01:09.190> that's<00:01:09.880> quite<00:01:10.180> a<00:01:10.210> bit<00:01:10.420> of<00:01:10.510> room<00:01:10.720> and<00:01:11.050> I

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
200 so that's quite a bit of room and I

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.170 
200 so that's quite a bit of room and I
can<00:01:11.290> just<00:01:11.440> set<00:01:11.620> that<00:01:11.800> right<00:01:11.950> on<00:01:12.010> top<00:01:12.280> there<00:01:12.610> and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
can just set that right on top there and

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.570 
can just set that right on top there and
so<00:01:13.660> in<00:01:13.780> terms<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.110> organization<00:01:14.800> what<00:01:15.370> I<00:01:15.400> did

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
so in terms of organization what I did

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.970
