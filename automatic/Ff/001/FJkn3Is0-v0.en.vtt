remove any of the moisture and wrinkles

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.520

when<00:00:54.530> creating<00:00:54.770> multicolor<00:00:55.400> designs<00:00:55.790> I

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
when creating multicolor designs I

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.540 
when creating multicolor designs I
recommend<00:00:57.290> changing<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.710> application<00:00:58.370> to

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
recommend changing the application to

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.100 
recommend changing the application to
limit<00:00:58.850> your<00:00:59.030> first<00:00:59.300> application<00:01:01.840> I'll<00:01:02.840> chain

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 
limit your first application I'll chain

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.810 
limit your first application I'll chain
just<00:01:03.260> a<00:01:03.410> 5<00:01:03.620> seconds<00:01:04.070> it'll<00:01:04.189> make<00:01:04.369> it<00:01:04.489> easier

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
just a 5 seconds it'll make it easier

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.430 
just a 5 seconds it'll make it easier
for<00:01:04.879> me<00:01:05.180> to<00:01:05.210> line<00:01:05.540> up<00:01:05.690> my<00:01:05.780> second<00:01:06.140> color<00:01:08.440> fill

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
for me to line up my second color fill

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:12.219 
for me to line up my second color fill
the<00:01:09.530> carrier<00:01:10.600> and<00:01:11.600> then<00:01:11.750> I<00:01:11.780> can<00:01:11.930> line<00:01:12.050> up<00:01:12.080> my

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:12.229 
the carrier and then I can line up my

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:13.719 
the carrier and then I can line up my
second<00:01:12.680> color<00:01:12.800> again<00:01:13.220> that<00:01:13.400> shortened

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:13.729 
second color again that shortened

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:15.969 
second color again that shortened
application<00:01:14.420> just<00:01:14.930> makes<00:01:15.110> it<00:01:15.200> easier<00:01:15.590> for<00:01:15.620> me

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
application just makes it easier for me

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.430 
application just makes it easier for me
to<00:01:16.390> be<00:01:17.390> able<00:01:17.450> to<00:01:17.600> line<00:01:17.750> up<00:01:17.870> my<00:01:17.900> second<00:01:18.320> color

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
to be able to line up my second color

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.200 
to be able to line up my second color
because<00:01:18.830> it<00:01:18.950> reduces<00:01:19.340> any<00:01:19.549> shrinking<00:01:20.030> in<00:01:20.120> the

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
because it reduces any shrinking in the

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.930 
because it reduces any shrinking in the
application<00:01:24.280> since<00:01:25.280> I<00:01:25.340> have<00:01:25.490> glitter<00:01:25.670> flake

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:25.940 
application since I have glitter flake

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.550 
application since I have glitter flake
expose<00:01:26.360> I'm<00:01:26.540> just<00:01:26.690> gonna<00:01:26.810> put<00:01:27.049> a<00:01:27.080> cover<00:01:27.290> sheet

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
expose I'm just gonna put a cover sheet

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.140 
expose I'm just gonna put a cover sheet
over<00:01:28.420> and<00:01:29.710> still<00:01:30.710> for<00:01:30.920> the<00:01:30.979> full<00:01:31.190> 15<00:01:31.700> seconds

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
over and still for the full 15 seconds

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.730 
over and still for the full 15 seconds
this<00:01:32.450> will<00:01:32.510> ensure<00:01:32.840> the<00:01:33.020> application<00:01:33.650> is

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
this will ensure the application is

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.140 
this will ensure the application is
going<00:01:33.890> to<00:01:33.979> go<00:01:34.159> through<00:01:34.400> both<00:01:34.670> layers<00:01:34.880> of

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
going to go through both layers of
