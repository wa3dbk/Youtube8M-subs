the body to the side where it differs is

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.899 
the body to the side where it differs is
if<00:01:55.390> there<00:01:55.690> was<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:55.810> coke<00:01:56.229> can<00:01:56.619> on<00:01:56.890> the<00:01:57.549> target

if there was a coke can on the target

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.080 
if there was a coke can on the target

from this position I hop in truck if you

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.530 
from this position I hop in truck if you
start<00:02:48.870> me<00:02:49.050> empowering<00:02:49.560> a<00:02:50.090> little<00:02:51.090> bit<00:02:51.180> harder
