little detent in the pocket clip and it

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:26.720 
little detent in the pocket clip and it
just<00:02:25.200> helps<00:02:25.500> to<00:02:25.590> the<00:02:26.040> knife<00:02:26.219> more<00:02:26.489> to<00:02:26.609> your

just helps to the knife more to your

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.250 
just helps to the knife more to your
hand

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
hand

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.399 
hand
it<00:02:28.260> feels<00:02:28.469> very<00:02:28.560> good<00:02:29.359> you<00:02:30.359> can<00:02:30.629> actually<00:02:30.930> wave

00:02:31.399 --> 00:02:31.409 
it feels very good you can actually wave

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:33.319 
it feels very good you can actually wave
this<00:02:31.769> out<00:02:32.069> of<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.370> pocket<00:02:32.730> using<00:02:32.879> the<00:02:33.120> thumb

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
this out of the pocket using the thumb

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:36.339 
this out of the pocket using the thumb
studs<00:02:33.599> they<00:02:33.810> protrude<00:02:34.170> just<00:02:34.620> enough<00:02:35.090> so<00:02:36.090> that

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
studs they protrude just enough so that

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.069 
studs they protrude just enough so that
should<00:02:37.349> you<00:02:37.469> be<00:02:37.620> carrying<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.189> tip<00:02:38.639> up<00:02:38.840> you<00:02:39.840> can

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
should you be carrying it tip up you can

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:43.220 
should you be carrying it tip up you can
pull<00:02:40.379> a<00:02:40.709> little<00:02:41.609> bit<00:02:41.790> of<00:02:41.939> outward<00:02:42.900> motion

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
pull a little bit of outward motion

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:44.509 
pull a little bit of outward motion
against<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.590> hem<00:02:43.769> of<00:02:43.859> the<00:02:43.920> pocket<00:02:44.370> will

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
against the hem of the pocket will

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.319 
against the hem of the pocket will
actually<00:02:44.879> catch<00:02:45.150> on<00:02:45.450> that<00:02:45.750> and<00:02:47.239> pull<00:02:48.239> the

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
actually catch on that and pull the

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.289 
actually catch on that and pull the
blade<00:02:48.540> like<00:02:49.139> so<00:02:49.470> but<00:02:50.099> I<00:02:50.340> don't<00:02:50.819> think<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:51.209> a

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
blade like so but I don't think it's a

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.979 
blade like so but I don't think it's a
reliable<00:02:51.870> enough<00:02:52.409> method<00:02:52.919> to<00:02:53.540> to<00:02:54.540> carry<00:02:54.810> it

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
reliable enough method to to carry it

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.520 
reliable enough method to to carry it
like<00:02:55.200> that<00:02:55.409> and<00:02:55.680> using<00:02:56.129> a<00:02:56.220> defensive

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
like that and using a defensive

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.809 
like that and using a defensive
situation<00:02:58.530> you<00:02:59.010> know<00:02:59.129> I<00:02:59.159> don't<00:02:59.519> think<00:02:59.579> you're

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
situation you know I don't think you're

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.390 
situation you know I don't think you're
going<00:02:59.969> to<00:03:00.060> be<00:03:00.180> able<00:03:00.269> to<00:03:00.419> do<00:03:00.629> that<00:03:00.840> every<00:03:01.200> time

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
going to be able to do that every time

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.149 
going to be able to do that every time
unless<00:03:02.400> you<00:03:02.989> practice<00:03:03.989> your<00:03:04.379> ass<00:03:04.500> off<00:03:04.769> with<00:03:04.980> it

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
unless you practice your ass off with it

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.449 
unless you practice your ass off with it
I<00:03:08.060> think<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.569> this<00:03:09.810> has<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.319> lot<00:03:10.980> of<00:03:11.010> potential

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
I think that this has a lot of potential

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:17.119 
I think that this has a lot of potential
for<00:03:12.349> for<00:03:13.349> a<00:03:13.379> kerambit<00:03:13.889> the<00:03:15.530> grips<00:03:16.530> feel<00:03:16.889> very

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:17.129 
for for a kerambit the grips feel very

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.250 
for for a kerambit the grips feel very
good<00:03:17.370> in<00:03:17.609> the<00:03:18.180> forward<00:03:18.599> grip<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.930> think<00:03:18.959> it

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
good in the forward grip I think it

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.069 
good in the forward grip I think it
would<00:03:19.379> make<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.560> great<00:03:19.979> thrusting<00:03:20.940> weapon<00:03:21.079> that

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
would make a great thrusting weapon that

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:25.819 
would make a great thrusting weapon that
tanto<00:03:22.979> point<00:03:23.310> is<00:03:23.489> very<00:03:23.790> thick<00:03:24.120> I<00:03:24.680> think<00:03:25.680> you're

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
tanto point is very thick I think you're

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.409 
tanto point is very thick I think you're
going<00:03:25.979> to<00:03:26.040> get<00:03:26.190> very<00:03:26.459> good<00:03:26.519> penetration<00:03:27.030> I

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:27.419 
going to get very good penetration I

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:30.199 
going to get very good penetration I
think<00:03:27.720> you're<00:03:27.840> losing<00:03:28.229> out<00:03:28.379> on<00:03:29.030> slashing<00:03:30.030> and

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
think you're losing out on slashing and

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.550 
think you're losing out on slashing and
pull<00:03:30.479> cut<00:03:30.780> ability<00:03:31.349> due<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.489> the<00:03:32.579> lack<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.819> a

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 
pull cut ability due to the lack of a

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.159 
pull cut ability due to the lack of a
hook<00:03:34.560> bill<00:03:34.829> style<00:03:35.280> blade<00:03:35.549> but<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.329> think<00:03:37.049> you

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:37.169 
hook bill style blade but I think you

00:03:37.169 --> 00:03:41.800 
hook bill style blade but I think you
gained<00:03:37.439> a<00:03:37.769> lot<00:03:38.579> more<00:03:38.780> utilitarian<00:03:40.040> advantages

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
gained a lot more utilitarian advantages

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.379 
gained a lot more utilitarian advantages
got<00:03:42.810> some<00:03:42.959> great<00:03:43.169> jumping<00:03:43.590> here<00:03:43.859> on<00:03:44.389> the

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:45.389 
got some great jumping here on the

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:48.379 
got some great jumping here on the
handle<00:03:45.989> scales<00:03:46.229> and<00:03:46.560> up<00:03:46.709> onto<00:03:47.009> the<00:03:47.129> blade<00:03:47.389> so

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:48.389 
handle scales and up onto the blade so

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.199 
handle scales and up onto the blade so
the<00:03:48.419> forward<00:03:48.930> grip<00:03:49.109> feels<00:03:49.939> very<00:03:50.939> comfortable

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209 
the forward grip feels very comfortable

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.379 
the forward grip feels very comfortable
very<00:03:51.780> secure<00:03:52.199> I<00:03:52.409> also<00:03:52.829> think<00:03:53.280> if<00:03:53.849> you<00:03:54.000> come<00:03:54.269> out

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
very secure I also think if you come out

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:57.530 
very secure I also think if you come out
of<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.979> ring<00:03:55.979> here<00:03:56.310> and<00:03:56.699> really<00:03:57.030> choke<00:03:57.299> up

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
of this ring here and really choke up

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.899 
of this ring here and really choke up
this<00:03:58.349> slight<00:03:58.769> depression<00:03:59.370> here<00:03:59.549> on<00:03:59.669> the<00:03:59.759> back

00:03:59.899 --> 00:03:59.909 
this slight depression here on the back

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.649 
this slight depression here on the back
the<00:04:00.090> blade<00:04:00.269> can<00:04:00.540> be<00:04:00.720> used<00:04:02.299> so<00:04:03.299> you<00:04:03.359> can

00:04:03.649 --> 00:04:03.659 
the blade can be used so you can

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:05.629 
the blade can be used so you can
actually<00:04:03.989> get<00:04:04.139> very<00:04:04.169> very<00:04:04.620> good<00:04:04.739> purchase<00:04:05.430> and

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
actually get very very good purchase and

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.610 
actually get very very good purchase and
do<00:04:05.729> some<00:04:05.909> fine<00:04:06.180> cutting<00:04:06.479> with<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:07.019> very

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
do some fine cutting with that very

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.330 
do some fine cutting with that very
sharp<00:04:08.009> nice<00:04:08.370> recurve<00:04:08.849> section<00:04:09.299> there<00:04:10.340> in

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
sharp nice recurve section there in

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.349 
sharp nice recurve section there in
reverse<00:04:11.759> grip

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
reverse grip

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.819 
reverse grip
I<00:04:12.389> was<00:04:12.689> a<00:04:12.750> little<00:04:13.019> bit<00:04:13.169> worried<00:04:13.379> but<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.709> might

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
I was a little bit worried but it might

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.670 
I was a little bit worried but it might
feel<00:04:14.009> a<00:04:14.069> bit<00:04:14.280> strange<00:04:14.579> and<00:04:14.970> if<00:04:15.239> this<00:04:15.680> spring

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
feel a bit strange and if this spring

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.849 
feel a bit strange and if this spring
assisted<00:04:17.070> pocket<00:04:17.430> clip<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:18.680> thought<00:04:19.680> that

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
assisted pocket clip I thought that

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:22.069 
assisted pocket clip I thought that
might<00:04:20.099> interfere<00:04:20.519> a<00:04:20.789> little<00:04:21.120> but<00:04:21.329> it<00:04:21.690> doesn't

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
might interfere a little but it doesn't

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:24.830 
might interfere a little but it doesn't
even<00:04:23.039> if<00:04:23.250> your<00:04:23.370> knuckles<00:04:23.789> right<00:04:24.270> up<00:04:24.450> against

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
even if your knuckles right up against

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.060 
even if your knuckles right up against
it<00:04:24.960> tight

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
it tight

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.160 
it tight
there's<00:04:26.910> no<00:04:27.030> sharp<00:04:27.330> edges<00:04:27.540> on<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:27.870> it<00:04:27.990> doesn't

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:28.170 
there's no sharp edges on it it doesn't

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:30.650 
there's no sharp edges on it it doesn't
feel<00:04:28.370> uncomfortable<00:04:29.370> maybe<00:04:30.150> if<00:04:30.360> he<00:04:30.480> had

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
feel uncomfortable maybe if he had

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.110 
feel uncomfortable maybe if he had
really<00:04:30.960> really<00:04:31.320> big<00:04:31.620> hands<00:04:31.890> that<00:04:32.160> it<00:04:32.430> might<00:04:32.730> it

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
really really big hands that it might it

which<00:04:54.300> i<00:04:54.450> think<00:04:54.510> is<00:04:54.810> a<00:04:55.050> really<00:04:55.350> good<00:04:55.560> value

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
which i think is a really good value

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.530 
which i think is a really good value

like<00:04:58.320> most<00:04:58.560> Koran<00:04:58.890> bits<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.280> think<00:04:59.490> it<00:04:59.610> has<00:04:59.760> its

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
like most Koran bits I think it has its

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.110 
like most Koran bits I think it has its
limitation<00:05:00.510> but<00:05:00.900> I<00:05:01.110> think<00:05:01.470> this<00:05:01.650> one<00:05:02.090> has<00:05:03.090> a

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
limitation but I think this one has a

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.320 
limitation but I think this one has a
lot<00:05:03.360> more<00:05:03.540> going<00:05:03.780> for<00:05:04.230> it<00:05:04.410> in<00:05:04.590> terms<00:05:04.860> of<00:05:05.220> a<00:05:05.430> of<00:05:05.970> a

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
lot more going for it in terms of a of a

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:09.820 
lot more going for it in terms of a of a
tool<00:05:06.600> in<00:05:07.530> comparison<00:05:08.220> to<00:05:08.250> something<00:05:08.970> like<00:05:09.390> V

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
tool in comparison to something like V

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.930 
tool in comparison to something like V
the<00:05:10.830> Fox<00:05:11.100> Karambit<00:05:13.160> which<00:05:14.160> i<00:05:14.520> think<00:05:14.580> is

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
the Fox Karambit which i think is

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.790 
the Fox Karambit which i think is
primarily<00:05:15.450> a<00:05:15.650> defensive<00:05:16.650> weapon<00:05:18.350> you<00:05:19.350> can<00:05:19.500> see

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
primarily a defensive weapon you can see

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.610 
primarily a defensive weapon you can see
there<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.840> very<00:05:21.840> similar<00:05:22.140> in<00:05:22.380> size<00:05:22.560> and

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:22.620 
there the very similar in size and

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
there the very similar in size and
overall<00:05:22.980> length<00:05:23.430> but<00:05:24.120> that<00:05:24.630> that<00:05:25.020> blade<00:05:25.290> shape

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
overall length but that that blade shape

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:34.880 
overall length but that that blade shape
completely<00:05:26.640> changes<00:05:27.180> the<00:05:27.530> use<00:05:33.620> so<00:05:34.620> there<00:05:34.800> we

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 
completely changes the use so there we

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.240 
completely changes the use so there we
go

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 
go

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.060 
go
