00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 hi all the guys are z uil hicks 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.810
 today I'm here with a new video of 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.920
 destinies in which rooster or the first 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.719
 episode about how to make sea come g 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.610
 Farming means getting into one 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.430
 fast way then at the same time 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.740
 get a specific object several times 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.480
 in this case they will be eni g i 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.130
 g years are those objects that you make 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.099
 get the elements that can 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.710
 be armor weapons and things like that 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.980
 and can be special legendary 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.860
 rare or uncommon or whatever it is 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.420
 they can be objects that 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.100
 should analyze the tar clip that allo 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.480
 same time as unexpected objects 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.500
 that have a strange name but certainly 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.789
 have great value or whatever it is 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.100
 something that you get 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.320
 through these objects other objects 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.750
 rare therefore today I will begin 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.579
 this series where I will show particular 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.440
 place and particular methods on how 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.590
 get as fast as possible to 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.210
 same time very many eni g before 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.949
 start off remember to leave a 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.080
 also like because it takes two 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.930
 seconds and really put so much e 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.270
 let's start right away first 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.130
 to make these emissions 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.590
 you can be with friends or otherwise 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.290
 be it alone no matter the first place 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.780
 that I wanted to show just to get 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.700
 in g as fast as possible and one 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.320
 moon mission you have to go up 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.119
 set at destination and then go 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.670
 on the moon and choose the mission 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.950
 the darkness and beyond and you have to start 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.530
 this mission with the level of 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.710
 difficulty set to 9 then the 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:37.680
 level 9 that is difficult therefore when 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.750
 you have thrown the mission you come up 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.420
 to the temple of crota where you will have to 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.280
 to revive a person and therefore there 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.079
 it will be a scene with a girl 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.490
 I try not to spoil so I don't 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.689
 I say nothing if you have done this 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.490
 mission was still if they wanted 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.950
 this video then after you have 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:56.009
 precisely seen that scene 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.189
 practically the crotta temple yes 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.259
 will open and there will be quite a few but 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.600
 several falls you have to shoot at 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.119
 all these fallen and hope to find 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.429
 in the midst of all these fallen of the han 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.110
 g when you practically have 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.530
 most of the fallen killed 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.740
 including captain slaves and similar things 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.120
 you practically have to get yourself killed 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.340
 from these fallen or in any case 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.800
 commit suicide with rocket launcher and what 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.990
 will happen practically have network 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.000
 always that check point and when 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.459
 you will marry that checkpoint practically 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.170
 the scene will repeat itself the temple will open 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.790
 and then will reappear for those 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.980
 you fall then you shoot those 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.840
 fallen to hope to find and made of copper 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.420
 as you see in the video I found several 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.520
 in g as also a friend of mine found 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.920
 a legendary engram you practically 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.959
 do this step until you are 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.180
 satisfied to find various ingrams 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.760
 you can find all kinds of grams 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.890
 what do you want precisely thanks to this 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.320
 mission even found a rifle 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.940
 automatic really very but very rare 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.400
 however it is passing instead the second one 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.319
 place the concept is always that 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.569
 you practically always have to go up 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:05.970
 set destination then you have to go 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.670
 on the ancient land and then chooses the 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.440
 mission patrols the cosmodrome when 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.610
 you will have started cosmodrome patrols a 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.620
 any difficulty 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.730
 you will practically have to make the road that 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.530
 see in the video 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.600
 however it is if you don't succeed well to 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.140
 understand video because it speeds it up a lot 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.030
 quickly 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.010
 just do it anyway it's a road 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.110
 specifies that you can still be a 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.239
 see you there are not many 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:28.950
 direction to make this road is 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.989
 you practically have to do this way 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.110
 up to a cave a 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.700
 left a rocket and then when you see 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.410
 spawn areas of enemies in that cave 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.600
 you practically always shoot in 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.860
 that cave and always shoot a 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.930
 repetition in these enemies inside 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:44.549
 of the cave they will continue to 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.739
 spur precisely into the 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.450
 cave and when you think you have ha 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.670
 killed enough enemies inside 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.769
 of this cave enter the cave 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.200
 to see if there are in g usually yes 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:57.120
 if you have not killed so many then one 

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.180
 once collected they have returned 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.820
 back at a distance just as you see 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.920
 in the video to redo this step e 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.269
 so you can do this step up to 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.920
 how many times you want 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.959
 obviously you don't have to stand in front of the 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.030
 cave if you have to try to stay longer 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.459
 back as possible in the cave more 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.440
 back be more spawned enemies were the 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.229
 third place that wants to show you though 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.269
 this time third place to get sea vi 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:24.780
 will serve two more friends is 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.680
 practically the nexus of the Venus world is 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.270
 an assault mission 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.430
 practically once the 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.350
 mission you need to always go 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.449
 there will also be a direction ahead 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.490
 specific also try to dodge 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:38.979
 obviously the enemies and to do the minimum 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.350
 of objectives up to one 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.330
 dark cave where on the left there is a 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:45.759
 cliff and where there is a fence 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:47.530
 practically with the yellow stripes e 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:49.630
 black a little as you see in the video here and 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.910
 then suddenly practically where 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.340
 there is the left side of the cliff yes 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.289
 they will marry all these goblins here you are 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.020
 you have to shoot these goblins and hope 

00:04:56.289 --> 00:05:01.389
 to obtain and in g practically when 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.550
 you see that the goblins will eventually need 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.949
 tell your friends and you need to 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.570
 do this action or kill yourself at 

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.949
 left of the cliff so you have to say 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.289
 your friends to kill me in the cliff 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:14.050
 as you too must do this thing 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:16.449
 once you have cleaned up the 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.669
 goblin place and you repeating 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:20.800
 again you have to hope that these 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.810
 gobi have and in grams so you do 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.240
 this step up to how many times you want 

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:27.789
 as you can see my friend got it 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:29.860
 also in this mission a program 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.090
 legendary said this please 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.320
 I lets not like 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.000
 it takes only two seconds e 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.080
 click that blue button and method 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.789
 really a lot 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.039
 leave me for there is the facebook page if 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.020
 goes to find in description also between 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:44.440
 little since I will be three years of youtube 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.240
 in a few days I will do a f acu then a 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.550
 special video 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:51.970
 sign up for other content and from 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:06:03.730
