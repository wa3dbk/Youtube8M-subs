there you go just lay there

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.700 
there you go just lay there
and<00:02:52.690> goes<00:02:52.900> smoothly<00:02:53.260> down<00:02:55.170> well<00:02:56.170> for<00:02:56.560> the

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
and goes smoothly down well for the

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.960 
and goes smoothly down well for the
articulation<00:02:57.330> just<00:02:58.330> how<00:02:58.420> basic<00:02:59.050> the<00:02:59.590> head<00:03:00.490> is

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
articulation just how basic the head is

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.640 
articulation just how basic the head is
on<00:03:01.180> a<00:03:01.210> ball-joint<00:03:01.480> so<00:03:01.930> I<00:03:01.960> can<00:03:02.140> do<00:03:02.260> a<00:03:02.290> lot<00:03:02.560> of

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
on a ball-joint so I can do a lot of

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.680 
on a ball-joint so I can do a lot of
things<00:03:03.030> yeah<00:03:04.030> can<00:03:04.510> we<00:03:04.720> go<00:03:06.030> side<00:03:07.030> to<00:03:07.060> side<00:03:07.180> like

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
things yeah can we go side to side like

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.620 
things yeah can we go side to side like
that

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.940 

the<00:03:11.630> shoulder<00:03:12.470> pads<00:03:12.680> can<00:03:12.950> go<00:03:13.070> down

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
the shoulder pads can go down

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.940 
the shoulder pads can go down
go<00:03:15.490> down<00:03:15.730> to<00:03:15.870> these<00:03:16.870> things<00:03:17.170> these<00:03:17.470> mud<00:03:17.920> flaps

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
go down to these things these mud flaps

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.890 
go down to these things these mud flaps
come<00:03:18.819> looking

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.540 

and<00:03:23.900> uh

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
yeah and go 360 the arms can go physics

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:36.199 
yeah and go 360 the arms can go physics
me

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.620 

elbow<00:03:37.209> can<00:03:37.420> go

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.880 

and<00:03:41.900> yeah<00:03:43.360> so<00:03:44.360> I<00:03:44.420> can<00:03:44.630> go<00:03:44.780> sigh<00:03:45.470> injection

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:45.890 
and yeah so I can go sigh injection

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.110 
and yeah so I can go sigh injection
assistant<00:03:46.310> so<00:03:46.460> I<00:03:46.490> can<00:03:46.670> go

the<00:03:50.510> rest<00:03:51.510> is<00:03:52.440> a<00:03:52.500> ball-joint<00:03:52.800> so

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:54.490 
the rest is a ball-joint so

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:59.670 
the rest is a ball-joint so
get<00:03:54.640> the<00:03:54.730> point<00:03:55.800> Wiggles<00:03:56.800> Oh<00:03:58.680> articulation
