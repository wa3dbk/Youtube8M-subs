 having a dog was so easy what 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:05.740

 million bbb is getting angry and I just 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.760
 to think of what I swore to look at 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.710

 person who wrote and emailed for help 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:41.100

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.010
 the closest people who wanted 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.600
 convince them to undo the dogs but he 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.820
 understands what we feel when we 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:50.510
 we truly attach to our 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.510
 best friends 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:58.640
 with access to these dogs a 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.100
 cute but so is the annoying sound of

 rock city at the door samsung 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.160
 general framework scenarios 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.080
 they basically need things 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.880
 simple but good baby 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:42.600
 The second point after exercises are 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.670
 On vacation, I know she's very serious. 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.310

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.870
 It was serious thanks to her natural mother. 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:10.290

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:15.150

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:17.420
 the apprehensive with the north zone where you have 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.420
 hurry 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:26.520
 I noticed that it was dominant aggressive era 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.190
 biba because she not only encouraged Julia 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.920
 Latin and how it also developed 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:35.040
 by hysteria attacked produce 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.630
 even on my own lap then what I 

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.720
 I was directing my attention to 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.970
 control first the Bible and the other that 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:43.950
 followed 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.350
 of course I would stay calm 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.070
 if its immediate free the bible stayed 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:52.410
 calm is just leave her the rules of the 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.340
 game now change every time she does 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.010
 something wrong 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.930
 she changed a few times to my fashion 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.390
 this means that it not only takes 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.520
 Latin Moon Principal The Answer Heard 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:04.890
 I just want him to understand that nothing wrong. 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.960
 will happen if I stay in this state 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.210
 calmly said the minister 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:11.940
 but I will not have my temper 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.780
 I will not even scream just in the name to 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.700
 I corrected 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.820
 all this is the east from today to 

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:19.970
 To write a pseudo-center, let's just go to facts 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:23.070
 and guests 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.770

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.810
 for this reason that challenges both 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.980
 established the template to write target 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:34.290
 copy 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.960
 after claiming the leadership of the bible 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:40.680
 and I have given this responsibility to 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:43.080
 renata so that everyone there understood that 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.860
 from that moment there would be a new 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.010
 leader 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:51.390
 or a new leader who would be owned 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:53.070
 if you get tense and show exactly 

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:55.380

 The next step is to help relate the 

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:18.460
 control dogs when someone touches the 

00:06:15.669 --> 00:06:20.370
 phone when someone knocks on the door and 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.960
