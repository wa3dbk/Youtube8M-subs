this<00:00:00.810> episode<00:00:01.230> is<00:00:01.380> about<00:00:01.530> abseiling<00:00:02.190> or<00:00:02.460> for

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
this episode is about abseiling or for

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.789 
this episode is about abseiling or for
those<00:00:02.909> in<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.179> States<00:00:03.419> repelling<00:00:04.230> which<00:00:04.650> is

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
those in the States repelling which is

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:06.740 
those in the States repelling which is
basically<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.460> safe<00:00:05.879> way<00:00:06.089> of<00:00:06.120> getting<00:00:06.480> from<00:00:06.660> the

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
basically a safe way of getting from the

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.330 
basically a safe way of getting from the
top<00:00:06.930> of<00:00:07.080> something<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.620> bottom<00:00:07.950> using<00:00:08.130> a

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
top of something to the bottom using a

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.860 
top of something to the bottom using a
rope<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:09.030> we're<00:00:09.240> going<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.389> show<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.660> the

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
rope and we're going to show you the

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.780 
rope and we're going to show you the
best<00:00:10.110> way<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.349> set<00:00:10.769> up<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.250> all<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
best way to set up and all the

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:25.770 
best way to set up and all the
techniques<00:00:12.150> involved

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:25.780 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.800 

so<00:00:26.430> stick<00:00:27.430> a<00:00:27.460> helmet<00:00:27.820> on<00:00:27.850> that<00:00:28.300> ensures<00:00:28.660> that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:28.810 
so stick a helmet on that ensures that

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.359 
so stick a helmet on that ensures that
if<00:00:29.050> anything<00:00:29.380> falls<00:00:29.619> on<00:00:29.770> your<00:00:29.830> head<00:00:29.890> or<00:00:30.130> if<00:00:30.220> you

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
if anything falls on your head or if you

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.130 
if anything falls on your head or if you
should<00:00:30.550> fall<00:00:30.760> you've<00:00:31.300> got<00:00:31.480> some<00:00:31.690> protection

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:32.140 
should fall you've got some protection

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.320 
should fall you've got some protection
for<00:00:32.320> your<00:00:32.380> scalp<00:00:32.680> the<00:00:33.489> second<00:00:33.910> thing<00:00:34.059> we<00:00:34.180> need

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.330 
for your scalp the second thing we need

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.970 
for your scalp the second thing we need
to<00:00:34.360> think<00:00:34.420> about<00:00:34.630> is<00:00:34.900> what<00:00:35.050> we<00:00:35.200> call<00:00:35.440> anchors

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
to think about is what we call anchors

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:38.580 
to think about is what we call anchors
which<00:00:36.280> is<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:36.700> position<00:00:37.030> that<00:00:37.450> attaches<00:00:38.320> you

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
which is the position that attaches you

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.860 
which is the position that attaches you
to<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:38.860> rock<00:00:39.040> at<00:00:39.190> the<00:00:39.280> top<00:00:39.309> now<00:00:40.239> anchors<00:00:40.750> can

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
to the rock at the top now anchors can

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.390 
to the rock at the top now anchors can
be<00:00:40.989> all<00:00:41.320> sorts<00:00:41.650> of<00:00:41.710> different<00:00:41.890> things<00:00:42.190> they

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
be all sorts of different things they

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.250 
be all sorts of different things they
can<00:00:42.430> be<00:00:42.610> bolts<00:00:43.090> they<00:00:43.239> can<00:00:43.420> be<00:00:43.570> threaded

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
can be bolts they can be threaded

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.869 
can be bolts they can be threaded
through<00:00:44.710> holes<00:00:44.739> in<00:00:45.129> the<00:00:45.190> rock<00:00:45.400> they<00:00:45.580> can<00:00:45.760> be

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:45.879 
through holes in the rock they can be

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.910 
through holes in the rock they can be
slings<00:00:46.180> put<00:00:46.449> over<00:00:46.720> chalk<00:00:47.170> stones<00:00:47.470> that<00:00:47.680> sort

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:47.920 
slings put over chalk stones that sort

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.380 
slings put over chalk stones that sort
of<00:00:47.949> thing<00:00:48.100> so<00:00:48.580> we're<00:00:48.730> going<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:48.910> look<00:00:49.030> at<00:00:49.150> a<00:00:49.210> few

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
of thing so we're going to look at a few

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.509 
of thing so we're going to look at a few
options<00:00:49.449> now<00:00:50.019> one<00:00:50.890> of<00:00:50.980> the<00:00:51.070> knots<00:00:51.280> that<00:00:51.370> you'll

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
options now one of the knots that you'll

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.100 
options now one of the knots that you'll
probably<00:00:51.640> find<00:00:51.910> very<00:00:52.180> very<00:00:52.330> useful<00:00:52.809> is<00:00:52.960> the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
probably find very very useful is the

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.590 
probably find very very useful is the
figure<00:00:53.379> eight<00:00:53.530> to<00:00:53.980> do<00:00:54.129> that<00:00:54.340> we<00:00:54.850> simply<00:00:55.180> make<00:00:55.449> a

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
figure eight to do that we simply make a

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.090 
figure eight to do that we simply make a
figure<00:00:55.870> of<00:00:56.110> eight<00:00:56.230> shape<00:00:56.530> in<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.769> rope<00:00:56.949> I'm

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
figure of eight shape in the rope I'm

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.549 
figure of eight shape in the rope I'm
going<00:00:57.220> to<00:00:57.280> take<00:00:57.460> plenty<00:00:57.730> of<00:00:58.000> loose<00:00:58.630> take<00:00:59.530> a

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
going to take plenty of loose take a

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.850 
going to take plenty of loose take a
nice<00:00:59.770> bite<00:01:00.190> of<00:01:00.219> the<00:01:00.489> rope<00:01:00.640> make<00:01:01.570> a<00:01:01.719> good<00:01:02.110> figure

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
nice bite of the rope make a good figure

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.870 
nice bite of the rope make a good figure
eight<00:01:03.100> shape<00:01:03.399> like<00:01:04.270> so<00:01:05.310> I'll<00:01:06.310> do<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:06.640> again

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
eight shape like so I'll do that again

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:12.420 
eight shape like so I'll do that again
just<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:10.479> make<00:01:10.630> a<00:01:10.660> figure<00:01:10.899> eight<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:12.100> go<00:01:12.190> around

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
just to make a figure eight to go around

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.420 
just to make a figure eight to go around
your<00:01:12.580> hand<00:01:12.759> around<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.869> rope<00:01:14.050> once<00:01:14.289> and<00:01:14.710> then

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
your hand around the rope once and then

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.040 
your hand around the rope once and then
back<00:01:15.640> down<00:01:15.910> through<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.240> hole<00:01:16.390> that's<00:01:16.840> your

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
back down through the hole that's your

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.540 
back down through the hole that's your
first<00:01:18.060> figure<00:01:19.060> eight<00:01:19.180> now<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:19.930> attach<00:01:20.320> that<00:01:20.619> to

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
first figure eight now to attach that to

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.210 
first figure eight now to attach that to
a<00:01:21.580> ring<00:01:21.850> bolt<00:01:22.090> which<00:01:22.450> we<00:01:22.600> have<00:01:22.720> up<00:01:22.840> here<00:01:23.220> take

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
a ring bolt which we have up here take

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.700 
a ring bolt which we have up here take
the<00:01:24.340> end<00:01:24.460> of<00:01:24.610> the<00:01:24.670> rope<00:01:24.820> it<00:01:25.000> goes<00:01:25.149> through<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:26.710 
the end of the rope it goes through the

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.920 
the end of the rope it goes through the
ring<00:01:26.920> bolt<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:28.420> so<00:01:28.830> and<00:01:29.830> then<00:01:30.790> we<00:01:30.909> follow<00:01:31.240> the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
ring bolt like so and then we follow the

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.560 
ring bolt like so and then we follow the
original<00:01:32.140> knot<00:01:32.619> so<00:01:33.549> bring<00:01:34.299> the<00:01:34.390> Rope<00:01:34.540> through

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
original knot so bring the Rope through

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.170 
original knot so bring the Rope through
goes<00:01:35.530> around<00:01:36.479> back<00:01:37.479> through<00:01:37.780> again<00:01:39.150> make<00:01:40.150> sure

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
goes around back through again make sure

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.730 
goes around back through again make sure
you've<00:01:40.450> got<00:01:40.479> plenty<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.960> spare<00:01:41.350> because<00:01:41.530> you

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
you've got plenty of spare because you

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.280 
you've got plenty of spare because you
want<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:42.009> do<00:01:42.070> a<00:01:42.100> stopper<00:01:42.490> knot<00:01:42.580> as<00:01:42.850> well<00:01:46.290> and

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
want to do a stopper knot as well and

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.050 
want to do a stopper knot as well and
there<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.560> is<00:01:47.710> nice<00:01:48.159> and<00:01:48.340> neat<00:01:48.369> figure<00:01:48.939> eight

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
there it is nice and neat figure eight

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.719 
there it is nice and neat figure eight
and<00:01:49.810> we'll<00:01:49.990> just<00:01:50.170> you<00:01:50.409> use<00:01:51.250> a<00:01:51.280> stopper<00:01:51.640> knot

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
and we'll just you use a stopper knot

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.210 
and we'll just you use a stopper knot
here<00:01:52.060> which<00:01:52.500> ensures<00:01:53.500> that<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.799> rope<00:01:53.950> can't

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
here which ensures that the rope can't

00:01:54.220 --> 00:02:01.350 
here which ensures that the rope can't
slip<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.770> that's<00:01:59.920> a<00:02:00.040> secure<00:02:00.490> position<00:02:00.670> now

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
slip and that's a secure position now

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.819 
slip and that's a secure position now
when<00:02:01.659> we're<00:02:01.810> abseiling<00:02:02.200> we<00:02:02.380> always<00:02:02.560> try<00:02:02.770> to

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
when we're abseiling we always try to

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.310 
when we're abseiling we always try to
use<00:02:03.070> three<00:02:03.610> a<00:02:03.820> minimum<00:02:04.479> of<00:02:04.630> three<00:02:04.990> anchor

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
use three a minimum of three anchor

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.440 
use three a minimum of three anchor
points<00:02:05.619> all<00:02:06.009> of<00:02:06.340> which<00:02:06.520> should<00:02:06.729> be<00:02:06.850> absolutely

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450 
points all of which should be absolutely

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.030

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.040

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.610 
bomb-proof now this ring bolt here
totally<00:02:09.820> solid<00:02:10.090> absolute<00:02:10.929> confidence<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.530> it

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
totally solid absolute confidence and it

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.650 
totally solid absolute confidence and it
would<00:02:11.709> probably<00:02:12.190> do<00:02:12.400> the<00:02:12.519> job<00:02:12.700> on<00:02:12.820> its<00:02:12.970> own<00:02:13.120> but

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
would probably do the job on its own but

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.880 
would probably do the job on its own but
we<00:02:13.780> always<00:02:13.900> like<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.170> have<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> back-up<00:02:14.709> plan

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
we always like to have a back-up plan

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:16.530 
we always like to have a back-up plan
and<00:02:15.310> then<00:02:15.519> a<00:02:15.549> back-up<00:02:15.640> back-up<00:02:16.329> plan<00:02:16.420> so

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
and then a back-up back-up plan so

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.630 
and then a back-up back-up plan so
that's<00:02:17.230> why<00:02:17.410> we<00:02:17.530> have<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.860> at<00:02:18.040> least<00:02:18.280> three

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
that's why we have the at least three

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.060 
that's why we have the at least three

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
bit of a bang as well make sure they're

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.910 
bit of a bang as well make sure they're
solid<00:02:42.459> we<00:02:43.090> want<00:02:43.239> that<00:02:43.390> to<00:02:43.540> fight<00:02:43.840> in<00:02:44.020> I'm

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
solid we want that to fight in I'm

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.800 
solid we want that to fight in I'm
pretty<00:02:45.489> sure<00:02:45.730> that's<00:02:45.910> well-placed

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
pretty sure that's well-placed

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.750 
pretty sure that's well-placed
lots<00:02:47.530> of<00:02:47.680> contact<00:02:48.160> if<00:02:48.250> you<00:02:48.280> look<00:02:48.550> there's

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
lots of contact if you look there's

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.550 
lots of contact if you look there's
plenty<00:02:48.879> of<00:02:49.090> contact<00:02:49.540> with<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.780> rock<00:02:49.959> so

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
plenty of contact with the rock so

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.890 
plenty of contact with the rock so
that's<00:02:50.739> a<00:02:50.800> well-placed<00:02:51.360> rock<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.629> now<00:02:52.750> we've

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
that's a well-placed rock so now we've

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.680 
that's a well-placed rock so now we've
got<00:02:53.050> two<00:02:53.319> points<00:02:54.280> of<00:02:54.370> contact<00:02:54.400> we<00:02:55.239> still<00:02:55.510> need

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
got two points of contact we still need

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.089 
got two points of contact we still need
that<00:02:55.840> third<00:02:56.140> one<00:02:56.349> so<00:02:56.590> let's<00:02:56.739> see<00:02:56.860> if<00:02:56.920> we<00:02:56.980> can

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
that third one so let's see if we can

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.960 
that third one so let's see if we can
find<00:02:57.280> another<00:02:57.459> one<00:02:59.250> well<00:03:00.250> placed<00:03:00.580> in<00:03:00.760> there

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
find another one well placed in there

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.970 
find another one well placed in there
that'll<00:03:01.269> do<00:03:01.390> nicely

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
that'll do nicely

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.360 
that'll do nicely
okay<00:03:04.290> an<00:03:05.290> important<00:03:05.860> thing<00:03:06.069> when<00:03:06.250> you're

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
okay an important thing when you're

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.970 
okay an important thing when you're
setting<00:03:06.640> up<00:03:06.700> an<00:03:06.819> am<00:03:06.940> sale<00:03:07.410> is<00:03:08.410> to<00:03:08.560> make<00:03:08.709> sure

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
setting up an am sale is to make sure

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.559

hitch<00:04:06.159> which<00:04:06.519> is<00:04:06.700> a<00:04:06.730> great<00:04:07.000> knot<00:04:07.209> very<00:04:07.930> very

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
hitch which is a great knot very very

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.259 
hitch which is a great knot very very
simple<00:04:08.409> to<00:04:08.500> do<00:04:08.620> to<00:04:09.250> do<00:04:09.340> a<00:04:09.370> clove<00:04:09.640> hitch<00:04:09.790> we<00:04:10.060> just

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
simple to do to do a clove hitch we just

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.320 
simple to do to do a clove hitch we just
take<00:04:10.420> a<00:04:10.450> bite<00:04:10.690> of<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.959> rope<00:04:11.110> make<00:04:12.010> a<00:04:12.040> loop<00:04:12.330> so

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
take a bite of the rope make a loop so

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:17.159 
take a bite of the rope make a loop so
make<00:04:13.510> a<00:04:13.540> loop<00:04:14.140> over<00:04:14.849> right<00:04:15.849> to<00:04:16.030> left<00:04:16.209> and<00:04:16.539> then

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
make a loop over right to left and then

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:21.180 
make a loop over right to left and then
make<00:04:17.289> a<00:04:17.320> second<00:04:17.830> loop<00:04:18.780> like<00:04:19.780> so<00:04:20.019> making<00:04:20.859> a<00:04:20.979> pair

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
make a second loop like so making a pair

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.490 
make a second loop like so making a pair
of<00:04:21.220> eyes<00:04:21.400> and<00:04:21.669> then<00:04:22.450> one<00:04:22.630> loop<00:04:22.840> goes<00:04:23.080> behind

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
of eyes and then one loop goes behind

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.899 
of eyes and then one loop goes behind
the<00:04:23.650> other<00:04:23.800> loop<00:04:23.979> so<00:04:24.190> I<00:04:24.250> just<00:04:24.370> do<00:04:24.490> that<00:04:24.640> again

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:24.909 
the other loop so I just do that again

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:28.020 
the other loop so I just do that again
so<00:04:25.900> make<00:04:26.080> your<00:04:26.200> first<00:04:26.440> loop<00:04:26.650> like<00:04:27.400> so<00:04:27.640> then

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
so make your first loop like so then

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.570 
so make your first loop like so then
your<00:04:28.270> second<00:04:28.630> loop<00:04:28.780> and<00:04:28.990> then<00:04:29.979> one<00:04:30.159> loop<00:04:30.340> goes

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:30.580 
your second loop and then one loop goes

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.430 
your second loop and then one loop goes
behind<00:04:30.789> the<00:04:31.030> other<00:04:31.150> one<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.930> then<00:04:32.080> we<00:04:32.200> clip

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
behind the other one and then we clip

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.890 
behind the other one and then we clip
this<00:04:32.590> into<00:04:32.919> our<00:04:33.099> screw<00:04:33.610> gate<00:04:33.789> carabiner

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.740 

that's<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:37.990> good<00:04:38.169> solid<00:04:38.380> knot<00:04:38.710> as<00:04:38.830> well<00:04:39.750> make

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
that's a good solid knot as well make

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.500 
that's a good solid knot as well make
sure

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:49.540 

this<00:04:48.170> is<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.350> figure<00:04:48.680> eight<00:04:48.770> for<00:04:49.070> obvious

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
this is a figure eight for obvious

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.670 
this is a figure eight for obvious
reasons<00:04:49.910> now<00:04:50.150> to<00:04:50.210> use<00:04:50.540> it<00:04:50.720> because<00:04:51.440> I'm

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:51.680 
reasons now to use it because I'm

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.210 
reasons now to use it because I'm
right-handed<00:04:52.240> I'll<00:04:53.240> place<00:04:53.540> a<00:04:53.920> bite<00:04:54.920> of<00:04:55.100> the

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
right-handed I'll place a bite of the

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.680 
right-handed I'll place a bite of the
rope<00:04:55.370> through<00:04:55.670> there<00:04:55.940> through<00:04:56.360> the<00:04:56.480> large

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
rope through there through the large

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.050 
rope through there through the large
loop<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.200> then<00:04:58.190> around<00:04:58.820> the<00:05:00.430> central<00:05:01.430> bar<00:05:01.640> so

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
loop and then around the central bar so

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:05.770 
loop and then around the central bar so
it<00:05:02.150> goes<00:05:02.300> around<00:05:02.590> like<00:05:03.590> so<00:05:03.860> and<00:05:04.540> then<00:05:05.540> we<00:05:05.630> take

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
it goes around like so and then we take

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:09.520 
it goes around like so and then we take
a<00:05:05.840> screw<00:05:06.140> get<00:05:06.320> carabiner<00:05:08.200> make<00:05:09.200> sure<00:05:09.410> it's

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
a screw get carabiner make sure it's

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:18.070 
a screw get carabiner make sure it's
done<00:05:09.710> it<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:11.330> that's<00:05:11.540> fine

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.100 

pull<00:05:18.620> tight<00:05:19.629> put<00:05:20.629> them<00:05:20.780> with<00:05:20.900> another

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
pull tight put them with another

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.920 
pull tight put them with another
carabiner<00:05:22.000> this<00:05:23.000> time<00:05:23.270> to<00:05:23.479> a<00:05:23.509> leg<00:05:23.720> loop

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:26.930 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:31.360 

so<00:05:27.830> if<00:05:28.100> we<00:05:28.400> were<00:05:28.520> to<00:05:28.669> let<00:05:28.940> go<00:05:29.150> of<00:05:29.180> the<00:05:30.190> rope<00:05:31.190> for

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.370 
so if we were to let go of the rope for

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:33.219 
so if we were to let go of the rope for
any<00:05:31.490> reason<00:05:31.880> at<00:05:32.000> all<00:05:32.150> this<00:05:32.449> press<00:05:32.720> ik<00:05:32.900> takes<00:05:33.110> up

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
any reason at all this press ik takes up

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:35.800 
any reason at all this press ik takes up
the<00:05:33.350> tension<00:05:33.560> and<00:05:34.310> allows<00:05:34.610> me<00:05:34.790> to<00:05:34.820> take<00:05:35.660> my

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
the tension and allows me to take my

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.510 
the tension and allows me to take my
weight<00:05:36.020> off<00:05:36.199> if<00:05:36.680> I<00:05:36.770> want<00:05:36.919> to<00:05:36.979> start<00:05:37.160> it<00:05:37.250> sliding

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
weight off if I want to start it sliding

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.400 
weight off if I want to start it sliding
again<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.300> you<00:05:38.389> start<00:05:38.630> sliding<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.229> prusik

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:39.410 
again and you start sliding the prusik

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:43.870 
again and you start sliding the prusik
down<00:05:39.770> the<00:05:39.949> rope<00:05:40.100> like<00:05:41.000> so<00:05:42.340> it<00:05:43.340> slows<00:05:43.610> things

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
down the rope like so it slows things

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.610 
down the rope like so it slows things
down<00:05:44.030> a<00:05:44.210> little<00:05:44.449> bit<00:05:44.630> it<00:05:44.810> makes<00:05:44.930> it<00:05:45.110> a<00:05:45.259> lot

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
down a little bit it makes it a lot

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:47.650 
down a little bit it makes it a lot
safer<00:05:45.889> so<00:05:46.789> if<00:05:46.910> you<00:05:47.000> are<00:05:47.060> descending<00:05:47.449> on<00:05:47.509> your

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
safer so if you are descending on your

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.090 
safer so if you are descending on your
own<00:05:47.810> and<00:05:47.990> you<00:05:48.110> don't<00:05:48.139> have<00:05:48.470> a<00:05:48.500> safety<00:05:48.800> rope

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
own and you don't have a safety rope

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:50.560 
own and you don't have a safety rope
this<00:05:49.310> is<00:05:49.490> the<00:05:49.580> best<00:05:49.789> way<00:05:49.970> to<00:05:50.000> do<00:05:50.240> it<00:05:50.360> make<00:05:50.539> sure

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
this is the best way to do it make sure

00:05:50.570 --> 00:06:45.129 
this is the best way to do it make sure
that<00:05:50.990> everything<00:05:51.770> is<00:05:51.979> totally<00:05:52.580> secure

00:06:45.129 --> 00:06:45.139 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:47.199 

you
