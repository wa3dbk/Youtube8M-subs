00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.000
 hello everyone in this video is going to 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.730
 teach how to get off trailers that 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.599
 they need for your computer if they have 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.080
 a pc or mac 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.929
 it does not matter this life basically this is 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.689
 a page that I do not want to enter 

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.939
 I say it's a fraud or something like that but 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:28.660
 who do not need it are not paying for 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.270
 download drivers and software they need 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.149
 there are basically ways to get it 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:37.910
 free and totally legal then no 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.010
 any program is paid or downloaded 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.280
 to say that they are going to try bears for 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:45.500
 you or things like this from here 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.510
 so what I do not want 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.629
 enter just want to give them an example of 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:55.210
 one of the pages that there are not very many 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:55.210
 they offer you try bears this they do not want 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.340
 I had quite a few questions so 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.340
 many of you 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:08.580
 for example if it comes in your has a 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.760
 new canon usually the citi that 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.410
 it comes is not updated as she 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.330
 It is always changing systems 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:18.000
 especially in mac am and 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.970
 updates then the shyris that 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.090
 come they're going to be obsolete and they're going to be 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.580
 download the drivers and software that 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.730
 you need your computer then that 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.610
 they are something current and updated they are going to 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.500
 have to go for example if they have a 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:40.320
 Canon camera 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:44.190
 let's say one of two and a three and they're going to 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.650
 have to go to canon dotcom already and 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.560
 inside there they will select good me 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:57.720
 English pele me right now but within 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:58.890
 every sport way in the usa where they are 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.460
 your 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.860
 inside here and so is that a porsche 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.920
 they do not leave to be here they can always go 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.679
 here that says they suppose drivers if in this 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.620
 area here 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:15.230
 summarize a little bit that is going to tell you 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.480
 they put good reverse inside there they go to 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.159
 choosing this is the long way in 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.769
 partial well be the way to life 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.840
 and the short because the length is usually 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.370
 the one that they know the most, that's why I'm in 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:29.190
 the drivers because it does not always work 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:32.370
 with the good cut then 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.740
 from here they will usually choose 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.810
 they always have this option here and they're going to 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.610
 choose this option here consume ever 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.330
 because there are all the cameras and everything 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:44.880
 let's say normal inside here we're going to 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.450
 be able to see everything that is cameras 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:50.340
 scanners and printers we will go by 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.300
 example just for an example we are going to 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.850
 go to cameras 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.710
 to cameras again and here we go to 

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.860
 choose one of the most popular right now 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.950
 is the three and so has lowered the 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.010
 and is priced fairly good camera da 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.220
 Same for everyone 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.770
 then we have spray here right now 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.200
 soft version 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.530
 practice a point is completely legal 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.390
 and free to download me right now I'm with 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.790
 marc but we can download them for windows 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.720
 8 have do not forget that if they have 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:28.160
 windows 8 maybe they have 32 bits or the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:30.500
 64 bit then it depends what they have in 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.360
 your computer or town as an hour already 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.080
 they all have 64 but there are still 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:38.300
 enough 32 the 64 are maybe a little 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.920
 faster but that does not mean it's going 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:44.890
 to run your computer then 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.890
 They have to make sure if they have 64 or 32 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.980
 right now let's say you have a brand 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.980
 we have more current soil to lower this 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.530
 so here I am going to show you all the 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.569
 software that can be downloaded more 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:01.299
 drivers that you can download everything 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:03.819
 that you need for your camera for example 

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.650
 if they have any printer like they are 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:10.319
 finding here will teach them 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.439
 right now the short way to see this to 

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:13.799
 Google 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:16.690
 within google they will put their camera 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:19.509
 I do not want them to just put 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.470
 for example if they want something that is 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.470
 physical fujifilm 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.490
 drivers because this is going to give you this 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.280
 basically they will give you the same page 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:32.950
 I told anyone before doing the 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:35.890
 long way instead of doing that is 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:39.340
 better to put exactly what they have 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.750
 then let's say that they have a future of 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.860
 camera 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:47.400
 x 61 or 60 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:51.949
 Although not all pages work 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.949
 easy but effective way and for all 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:58.460
 well it does not give us a super direct option 

00:04:55.490 --> 00:05:03.400
 but here we can see that it gives us already 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:05.290
 go directly to what the software is 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.080
 increases can click on any 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:10.919
 of these or for example if they are looking 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.919
 for a canon 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:16.669
 drivers 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:21.330
 the driver does not matter 

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:23.870
 I 'm going to give you a little more direct 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.870
 the canon 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:29.759
 so they do not find him like that they have 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:31.380
 to be in the long way because I 

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.419
 we can click here for example no 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.919
 matter they are in Ecuador elsewhere 

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.960
 You can say they are in you like that 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.819
 get off and to 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.280
 Inside here you can see drivers 

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:44.160
 then we can bring without software and already 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:46.500
 it gives us one they detect us which and 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:50.380
 we can click on each one to see if 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:52.670
 there is a driver for each camera 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.130
 so if you do not give them anything right now 

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:57.550
 for example in this part of trailers 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:59.990
 that maybe they need 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.810
 just choose a lower version 

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:04.640
 and see if he has any 9 if he's still 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.100
 well, it does not give them is because they're just 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.620
 install the software here and so they 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.210
 will work 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.120
 yes 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.310
 they already have that for example if they are another 

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:20.300
 Once I find a driver simply 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:22.880
 go to the official website as epson 

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:26.210
 if you have an epson printer and they will see 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.569
 there and always to drivers in support or if 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:31.610
 says its sport port 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:33.620
 always look at the same model they are going to 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:34.610
 be the model of your camera or your 

00:06:33.620 --> 00:06:36.759
 printer 

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:39.110
 usually they are numbers with letters 

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:41.960
 then for example a printer that 

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:44.990
 I have 100 w measurement and feinstein 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.720
 then it is one of the impressions that 

00:06:44.990 --> 00:06:49.090
 I have 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.340
 this is basically marked in front 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.980
 of the printer and it's only in 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.350
 large letters is never very hidden 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:57.820
 It is also hidden in a sticker 

00:06:56.350 --> 00:07:00.370
 only back on the right side 

00:06:57.820 --> 00:07:02.620
 left of the printer then there 

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.800
 you can also see but always so 

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.560
 common is in the front in 

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:11.590
 some part very visible the model for 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.170
 that can see it good this is the most 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:16.870
 easy to see the drivers if it's still 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.730
 so with my instructions they could not 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.040
 find the driver or software that 

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.720
 need can you write me here in the 

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:24.280
 comments and I'm going to get you the 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.130
 you can send a link so they can be 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.230
 go down to the official page or maybe I 

00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.640
 I can download the same I can send a 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:33.449
 link to get off of me 

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:36.120
 Dropbox does not matter 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:38.969
 do not forget to subscribe and put 

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.479
 like and anything in the comments 

00:07:38.969 --> 00:07:41.479
 Thank you 

00:07:43.349 --> 00:07:46.349
 I
