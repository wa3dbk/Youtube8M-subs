 the remaining milk is poured into the pan and 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.450
 now this milk we bring to 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:36.519
 boil and just warm up to us 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.110

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:43.360
 hot milk is thin 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:44.019
 trickle into our mass then ice to 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.680
 thin 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.680
 and where is the halo 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:59.490
 ok you should get this 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.080
 the batter is now in it we add 2 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:07.820

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.540
 minutes slowly getting com 250 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.689
 milliliters of our heavy cream us 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.030
 need to pour into the saucepan and not bringing up 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:34.319
 boil the truth warm them up so they 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:36.810
 were hot most importantly it 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.250
 stir regularly so that the cream does not 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.180
 burned touch 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:45.870
 by skating prevents the cream i'll take 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.549

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.519
 them into small pieces, and all at once 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.700
 plate like this, in principle, you can still 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:56.670
 break more and so all the same little 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.670
