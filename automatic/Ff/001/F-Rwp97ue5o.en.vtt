00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:18.060
 Hi girls, how are you? I'm the brand of 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.300
 virtual shop for assembly parts 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.130
 Costume jewelry at www how much factory required 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.220
 how much with 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.260
 So this video came back to you with 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.460
 order to take some questions on 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.080
 tails 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.600
 many people come and ask me about 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.880
 Which is the best for better school here? 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.980
 in the last video that we did one 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:44.300
 earring set with chatons and rhinestones 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:54.270
 I used it saying this brings the drawing 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:57.449
 It's good and it 's this one so I 'm going 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:01.980
 explain why this white line 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.979
 she is great to show why 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.500
 why it did not dazzle the brightness though 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.799
 she does not have a good fit 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.890
 soon after the session starts, okay? 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.860
 since the sticker is good you do not use with 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.430
 enough care to stop honoring 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.590
 2-1 up he always Beetle extract 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.369
 so the idea is to use with enough 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.500
 caution 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.990
 but it has an excellent setting 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:32.189
 protocol both as rhinestone 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.920
 chaton with the current the saint the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.530
 super box top as the gearbox the 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:42.540
 two are excellent and over there 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:46.049
 already the white line she has to not find 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:49.290
 one is however I do not like the fixed 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.549
 already the super glue and until the tram that 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:57.060
 I use or the superbond I only use it 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.619
 in chatons for maxi making necklace or 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.540
 osaka-mount color for you because 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.320
 it stains the SES 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.710
 both the condition and the chaton so 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:14.200
 that I use only rice 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.570
 a video of maxi paste only this for 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.870
 can fix because it is good for the 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:22.510
 Next she hit stuck him no ramp 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.750
 very difficult not so okay sense use 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.940
 half the world around me, I pass the 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.080
 utopian desire to be able to give 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.420
 finishing 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.610
 so there were no people in the 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.800
 none for back bonding to the 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.980
 collage of school chaton from the 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.470
 coyote school would not use 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.790
 that stain even ruin your piece and 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.700
 there is no back 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.970
 already the universal quota and uses 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.940
 next following teas for corm paste 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.610
 leather is great great at this you 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.980
 want to finish the dictionary 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:00.550
 schoolboy on background of you cut necklace 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:03.220
 very leather when an a girl in these 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:06.850
 nine is great for sticking with a 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:09.280
 chorus I use it in this case the plate 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.070
 with back collage and not only had 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.620
 They went with this so I hope that you 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.080
 Did you like this video? 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.940
 conversation in a chat that the use of 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.340
 glue is a general doubt generally 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.160
 I received several emails without glue 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.690
 should be used with 4 is better to use then 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.790
