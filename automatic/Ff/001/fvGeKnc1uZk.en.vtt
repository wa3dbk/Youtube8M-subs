00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:08.800
 hello welcome to a new video of 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.480
 critical studies in this video we are going to 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.010
 see how we can work with your videos 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.019
 How do I know your videos have a 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.090
 most beautiful visual aesthetic how is the 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.640
 viewer does not marry the making of 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.830
 some 10 15 seconds but I have a 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.779
 Little rabbit as well and your series 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.780
 favorites or the movies you've seen 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:27.200
 like the shots that are very slow 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.170
 this is the unemployed person 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:33.350
 an approach or a moment on the side 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.560
 well that works with sliders or with 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.350
 rails that these have those layers of 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.810
 give a very good aesthetic then 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.980
 you take it because you do not have a check-in 

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.720
 your cameras do not have to be 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.140
 ending one side if it is much thought 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.120
 this good maybe you wanted to do 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.559
 something like that maybe you have said hey then to 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.570
 Equally the cameraman has very good 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.940
 pulse and he goes by walking one side to 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.290
 other then you do not have to have a slider 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.090
 we will also see how you can 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:01.370
 build your own sly at home but 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.190
 well, let's go later 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:08.930
 we're going to give you tips on how we handle and 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.700
 how you should not handle it and the 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:14.450
 differences of having a slider and having 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.490
 your hand so well maybe you've 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.290
 tried to make shots similar to 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.290
 these or maybe not but if you did 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.429
 good luck with that 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.429
 you are going to finish him 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.760
 t 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.430
 on the way 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.860
 and 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.740
 and 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.220
 yes 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.370
 well after seeing all the attempts 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.990
 of failed sliders human sliders by 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:06.970
 so I say I know that I think that you 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.510
 did you ever do or try to do it 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.510
 by you said 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.700
 you already did 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.040
 but 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.319
 anyway 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.319
 Do not give up on how I do it 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:38.069
 I know it's hard to think of something like that 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.420
 that for this what what we are going to 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:44.630
 need 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.630
 is to build your own slider at home 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.170
 it seems that you are going to need what is 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:56.900
 basically and little time rather a 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.310
 little time and money for that you're going to 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:03.740
 need what a skateboard is how 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.540
 it's good then so what are we so many 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:10.550
 this is a very big little one a lot 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:14.120
 better and I want you to need some 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:16.250
 It's free or rails that are for curtains 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.640
 that any part and way are of 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.390
 aluminum are very good 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:26.030
 thanks that's all 300 good for this 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.880
 what you need is just to put it 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:33.080
 on the table put your continent up 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:35.420
 and then your camera on top of the only 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:39.680
 disadvantage that you have is that you're not going to 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:44.450
 can put or put it in top 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:47.390
 of a triple because there is no way 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.550
 unless you can imagine and you smoke here and 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:51.140
 make sun extract super super produced 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:54.319
 in europe you have not invested over time 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.630
 a money jet and is the critical person 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.990
 and good 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:02.330
 immediately we go to some videos in 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.910
 where will you know the difference of a 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.120
 slider 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.390
 by hand 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:14.770
 a professional slider and a slider 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:16.630
 has made home which he is the 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.810
 You can get it professional and what 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.579
 you can bring good you can get in 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.530
 That Mr. Puntocom is a page 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.040
 very good where you can find many 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:26.080
 products 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:32.120
 You can find a lot of variety 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:36.490
 sliders solÃ­s aesthetic cranes is to say 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.490
 Well let's like to be seen 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.300
 to keep the chest I'm leaving for 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.699
 so much 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.310
 if it's a bit heavy the truth is a 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.830
 little but good since we do not have a 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.220
 little hand here you can show this 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:59.630
 is a professional slider as you can see 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:03.289
 here this serves in a way 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:06.129
 manual if you want 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.129
 by way of 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:16.160
 Y 

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:16.160
 be the others who like it 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:21.250
 and good as we just observed in 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.500
 this last video we saw the tools 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.210
 what we use or buy to do 

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.470
 ours is the one of house we have that 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.380
 emphasize that it is one of the most 

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:31.360
 economic there is which is going to 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.880
 serve for some small steps but 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:35.980
 for some small examples it's not going 

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.200
 to be able to reach for all power 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.830
 mount it in a 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:44.460
 great bar of things on a large table 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:47.130
 yes yes yes but good happened to us 

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:50.040
 unless you have to screw and 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.300
 drill and do too many things and 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:53.160
 good as we want we are 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:55.230
 creative I hope you liked it 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.460
 our work will be going up 

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.250
 videos 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.810
 weekly so they are attentive and 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:05.840
 blind or facebook that can 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.840
 find as creative script or this
