camera on the Samsung Galaxy s3
now<00:00:15.210> before<00:00:15.509> I<00:00:15.540> settle<00:00:15.960> for<00:00:15.990> my<00:00:16.289> very<00:00:16.619> short

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
now before I settle for my very short

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.099 
now before I settle for my very short
journey<00:00:17.279> with<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.730> I'm<00:00:18.090> gonna<00:00:18.240> just<00:00:18.449> test<00:00:18.779> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
journey with you I'm gonna just test the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.279 
journey with you I'm gonna just test the
digital<00:00:19.800> zoom<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:20.490> the<00:00:20.820> phone<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.330> zoom<00:00:22.080> all

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
digital zoom on the phone and zoom all

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.429 
digital zoom on the phone and zoom all
the<00:00:22.350> way<00:00:22.650> into<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.340> four<00:00:23.670> times<00:00:24.000> angle<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.630> so

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
the way into the four times angle and so

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.529 
the way into the four times angle and so
this<00:00:25.619> is<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.769> four<00:00:26.189> times<00:00:26.490> digital<00:00:27.029> zoom<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.390> do

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
this is a four times digital zoom you do

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.810 
this is a four times digital zoom you do
have<00:00:27.720> to<00:00:27.840> hold<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.349> phone<00:00:28.619> very<00:00:29.099> stable<00:00:29.490> so

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
have to hold the phone very stable so

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.849 
have to hold the phone very stable so
you<00:00:29.880> don't<00:00:30.090> get<00:00:30.210> shaky<00:00:30.539> image<00:00:30.960> and<00:00:31.170> then<00:00:31.710> we

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
you don't get shaky image and then we

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.400 
you don't get shaky image and then we
zoom<00:00:32.160> all<00:00:32.369> the<00:00:32.430> way<00:00:32.730> back<00:00:33.000> out<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.899> widest

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
zoom all the way back out to the widest

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.470 
zoom all the way back out to the widest
angle<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:35.460> let's<00:00:35.670> get<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:35.940> camera<00:00:36.300> into

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
angle so let's get this camera into

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.600 
angle so let's get this camera into
position<00:00:37.050> now<00:00:37.649> you're<00:00:37.890> not<00:00:37.980> gonna<00:00:38.129> hear<00:00:38.399> any

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
position now you're not gonna hear any

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.760 
position now you're not gonna hear any
wind<00:00:38.910> noise<00:00:39.030> in<00:00:39.540> this<00:00:39.690> video<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.320> that's

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
wind noise in this video and that's

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.069 
wind noise in this video and that's
because<00:00:41.100> I'm<00:00:41.219> inside<00:00:41.550> my<00:00:41.790> car<00:00:42.090> what<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.719> might

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
because I'm inside my car what you might

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.290 
because I'm inside my car what you might
pick<00:00:43.320> up<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.980> some<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.640> engine<00:00:45.149> noise

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
pick up is that some of the engine noise

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.959 
pick up is that some of the engine noise
but<00:00:46.289> let's<00:00:46.440> see<00:00:46.590> how<00:00:46.739> this<00:00:46.920> camera<00:00:47.340> performs

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
but let's see how this camera performs

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.000 
but let's see how this camera performs
with<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.300> differences<00:00:48.899> in<00:00:49.020> lighting<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.770> as<00:00:49.890> I

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
with the differences in lighting so as I

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.360 
with the differences in lighting so as I
go<00:00:50.190> from<00:00:50.430> sort<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.480> dark<00:00:51.930> situation<00:00:52.260> to<00:00:53.129> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
go from sort of a dark situation to the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.740 
go from sort of a dark situation to the
bright<00:00:53.730> sky<00:00:54.000> that's<00:00:54.420> going<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.629> come

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
bright sky that's going to come

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.290 
bright sky that's going to come
interview<00:00:55.199> soon<00:00:55.500> we'll<00:00:56.190> see<00:00:56.219> how<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> galaxy

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
interview soon we'll see how the galaxy

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.400 
interview soon we'll see how the galaxy
s3<00:00:57.449> copes<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.680> change<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.250> exposure

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
s3 copes with a change in the exposure

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.410 
s3 copes with a change in the exposure
now<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.440> would<00:01:01.590> do<00:01:01.800> bear<00:01:02.039> in<00:01:02.219> mind<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.030> is

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
now I would do bear in mind that this is

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.740 
now I would do bear in mind that this is
just<00:01:03.719> sort<00:01:04.439> on<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.890> mount<00:01:05.339> inside<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.119> car<00:01:06.360> so

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
just sort on a mount inside the car so

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.450 
just sort on a mount inside the car so
you<00:01:06.780> might<00:01:07.049> get<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> little<00:01:07.500> bit<00:01:07.740> shaky<00:01:08.010> R<00:01:08.189> image

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
you might get a little bit shaky R image

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.640 
you might get a little bit shaky R image
be<00:01:09.030> interesting<00:01:09.570> to<00:01:09.689> see<00:01:09.900> if<00:01:10.140> there<00:01:10.320> is<00:01:10.439> any

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
be interesting to see if there is any

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
be interesting to see if there is any
image<00:01:11.010> stabilization<00:01:11.520> offered<00:01:12.270> up<00:01:12.390> by<00:01:12.630> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
image stabilization offered up by the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.679 
image stabilization offered up by the
galaxy<00:01:13.530> s3<00:01:13.979> but<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:14.700> seems<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.150> do<00:01:15.270> a<00:01:15.299> fairly

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
galaxy s3 but it seems to do a fairly

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.020 
galaxy s3 but it seems to do a fairly
good<00:01:15.840> job<00:01:16.020> now<00:01:16.890> whilst<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.400> was<00:01:17.520> using<00:01:17.759> this

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
good job now whilst I was using this

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.660 
good job now whilst I was using this
when<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.780> was<00:01:18.960> walking<00:01:19.530> outside<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.430> field

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
when I was walking outside on the field

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.760 
when I was walking outside on the field
you<00:01:20.790> can<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.330> left<00:01:21.420> I<00:01:22.080> was

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
you can see to the left I was

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.679 
you can see to the left I was
experiencing<00:01:23.549> quite<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:23.970> lot<00:01:24.210> of<00:01:24.240> difficulty

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
experiencing quite a lot of difficulty

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.490 
experiencing quite a lot of difficulty
seeing<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:26.159> screen<00:01:27.000> when<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.750> had<00:01:27.930> in<00:01:28.049> direct

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
seeing the screen when I had in direct

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.260 
seeing the screen when I had in direct
sunlight<00:01:28.799> that's<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.820> things<00:01:30.090> I

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
sunlight that's one of the things I

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.450 
sunlight that's one of the things I
think<00:01:30.450> could<00:01:30.840> be<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.020> lot<00:01:31.290> better<00:01:31.500> with<00:01:32.250> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
think could be a lot better with the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.560 
think could be a lot better with the
Super<00:01:32.850> AMOLED<00:01:33.329> HD<00:01:33.509> display<00:01:34.610> that<00:01:35.610> said<00:01:35.970> it<00:01:36.540> was

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
Super AMOLED HD display that said it was

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.020 
Super AMOLED HD display that said it was
usable<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.829> was<00:01:37.979> just<00:01:38.159> difficult<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.610> compose

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
usable it was just difficult to compose

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.120 
usable it was just difficult to compose
some<00:01:39.420> shots<00:01:39.780> when<00:01:40.079> the<00:01:40.259> sunlight<00:01:40.470> was<00:01:40.799> very

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
some shots when the sunlight was very

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.569 
some shots when the sunlight was very
bright<00:01:41.960> so<00:01:42.960> I'm<00:01:43.229> just<00:01:43.380> coming<00:01:43.649> down<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:44.250> so

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
bright so I'm just coming down here so

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.190 
bright so I'm just coming down here so
we're<00:01:44.850> going<00:01:44.939> to<00:01:45.000> have<00:01:45.149> another<00:01:45.420> quite<00:01:45.990> big

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
we're going to have another quite big

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.620 
we're going to have another quite big
change<00:01:46.500> in<00:01:46.710> lighting<00:01:46.979> we've<00:01:47.939> got<00:01:48.119> lots<00:01:48.360> of
