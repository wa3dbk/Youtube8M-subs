last<00:00:25.490> year<00:00:25.670> we're<00:00:26.420> using<00:00:26.689> glasses<00:00:27.140> that<00:00:27.470> were

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
last year we're using glasses that were

effect now for this to happen required a

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.649 
effect now for this to happen required a
significant<00:01:03.739> processing<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:04.460> go<00:01:04.580> on<00:01:04.729> inside

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
significant processing to go on inside

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.999 
significant processing to go on inside
the<00:01:05.900> TV<00:01:06.439> and<00:01:06.860> that's<00:01:07.430> where<00:01:07.700> the<00:01:07.939> st's<00:01:09.009> video

00:01:09.999 --> 00:01:10.009 
the TV and that's where the st's video

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:12.539 
the TV and that's where the st's video
chip<00:01:10.310> comes<00:01:10.579> in<00:01:10.759> and<00:01:10.939> we<00:01:11.119> call<00:01:11.299> it<00:01:11.329> the<00:01:11.479> premium

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
chip comes in and we call it the premium

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:14.830 
chip comes in and we call it the premium
premiere<00:01:13.549> in<00:01:13.700> this<00:01:13.880> case<00:01:14.090> you<00:01:14.329> actually<00:01:14.600> the

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
premiere in this case you actually the

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.719 
premiere in this case you actually the
Fremen<00:01:15.259> line<00:01:15.439> of<00:01:15.619> soc<00:01:16.100> we<00:01:16.369> have<00:01:16.490> five

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
Fremen line of soc we have five

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:18.480 
Fremen line of soc we have five
different<00:01:16.909> models

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
different models

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.630 
different models
cases<00:01:18.970> are<00:01:19.210> middle<00:01:19.600> of<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.780> road<00:01:19.960> model<00:01:20.890> and

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
cases are middle of the road model and

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.429 
cases are middle of the road model and
what<00:01:21.759> makes<00:01:21.970> it<00:01:22.090> very<00:01:22.299> significant<00:01:23.049> this<00:01:23.290> is

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:23.439 
what makes it very significant this is

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:25.740 
what makes it very significant this is
the<00:01:23.560> only<00:01:23.710> one<00:01:24.040> on<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.399> market<00:01:24.610> that<00:01:25.390> actually

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
the only one on the market that actually

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.830 
the only one on the market that actually
has<00:01:25.930> not<00:01:26.350> only<00:01:26.500> a<00:01:26.649> 3d<00:01:26.979> process<00:01:27.520> but<00:01:28.360> motion

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
has not only a 3d process but motion

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.070 
has not only a 3d process but motion
compensated<00:01:30.119> interpolated<00:01:31.119> frame<00:01:31.509> process

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
compensated interpolated frame process

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.830 
compensated interpolated frame process
what<00:01:33.009> this<00:01:33.130> does<00:01:33.340> it<00:01:33.610> removes<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.299> judder

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 
what this does it removes the judder

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.710 
what this does it removes the judder
that<00:01:35.080> is<00:01:35.229> introduced<00:01:35.649> by<00:01:35.770> film<00:01:36.340> material<00:01:36.970> and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
that is introduced by film material and

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.929 
that is introduced by film material and
when<00:01:37.990> you<00:01:38.140> get<00:01:38.320> your<00:01:38.549> motion<00:01:39.549> left-to-right

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
when you get your motion left-to-right

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:42.690 
when you get your motion left-to-right
motion<00:01:40.570> up<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:40.869> down<00:01:41.080> or<00:01:41.289> diagonal<00:01:41.799> we<00:01:42.340> remove

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
motion up and down or diagonal we remove

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.270 
motion up and down or diagonal we remove
any<00:01:43.000> kind<00:01:43.270> of<00:01:43.390> judder<00:01:43.720> and<00:01:44.080> that<00:01:44.649> makes<00:01:44.860> a<00:01:44.979> very

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
any kind of judder and that makes a very

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.969 
any kind of judder and that makes a very
smooth<00:01:45.700> effect<00:01:46.149> and<00:01:47.020> this<00:01:47.229> preservatives<00:01:47.920> in

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:47.979 
smooth effect and this preservatives in

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.969 
smooth effect and this preservatives in
3d<00:01:48.399> effect<00:01:48.880> for<00:01:49.659> all<00:01:49.840> types<00:01:50.140> of<00:01:50.350> content<00:01:50.799> and

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
3d effect for all types of content and

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.960 
3d effect for all types of content and
it<00:01:51.130> really<00:01:51.459> makes<00:01:51.789> watching<00:01:52.509> 3d<00:01:53.110> TV<00:01:53.970> wonderful

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
it really makes watching 3d TV wonderful

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.969 
it really makes watching 3d TV wonderful
so<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.420> combined<00:01:55.780> effect<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.229> the<00:01:56.380> processing

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
so the combined effect of the processing

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.389 
so the combined effect of the processing
that<00:01:57.130> st's<00:01:57.659> with<00:01:58.659> this<00:01:58.899> new<00:01:59.399> lower-cost

00:02:00.389 --> 00:02:00.399 
that st's with this new lower-cost

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:01.710 
that st's with this new lower-cost
technology<00:02:01.240> and<00:02:01.360> more<00:02:01.509> comfortable

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
technology and more comfortable

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.440 
technology and more comfortable
technology<00:02:02.530> with<00:02:02.709> the<00:02:02.890> glasses<00:02:03.130> is<00:02:04.119> going<00:02:04.390> to

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:04.450 
technology with the glasses is going to

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.690 
technology with the glasses is going to
be<00:02:04.569> a<00:02:04.600> key<00:02:04.869> contributor<00:02:05.380> to<00:02:05.799> the<00:02:05.979> adoption<00:02:06.340> of
