00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:21.039
 for this we write 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.039
 successes with the three dot com 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:28.050
 this is the page and we have a 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.119
 list of successes we can 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.820
 choose them and we do not know what disk 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.579

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.660

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:42.410
 choose this search engine 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:44.870
 and album searchers releases then 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.989
 what do we do we write the name of the 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.989
 group 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:54.310
 in this case for example and we can put 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.690
 the name of the album's CD in this case 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.270
 let's see what he offers us with 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:00.020
 client 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.020
 click on search 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.680

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.120
 we can download and watch other albums 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.120

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.930
 green day launch for it not

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.170
 advertising is worth then we see the name 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.900
 of the album on the release date and 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.930
 the quality 320 is very well perfect 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.990
 this well 192 is also good 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.640
 - it loses a little bit more quality 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.910
 it will take a lot of space here to have what 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:42.050
 occupies 94 megabytes we click here on 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.050
