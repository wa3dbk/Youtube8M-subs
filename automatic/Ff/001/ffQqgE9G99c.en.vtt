00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
measure mine it was about three and a

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.369 
measure mine it was about three and a
half<00:00:49.530> inches<00:00:50.039> across<00:00:50.340> by<00:00:51.050> three<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> half

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
half inches across by three and a half

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.290 
half inches across by three and a half
inches<00:00:52.800> long<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.430> basically<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:54.090> square

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
inches long so it's basically a square

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.569 
inches long so it's basically a square
and<00:00:54.660> you<00:00:55.199> want<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.469> mark<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.739> out<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.309> some

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
stretchy fabric you can use tights you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.580 
stretchy fabric you can use tights you
can<00:00:58.980> use<00:00:59.239> you<00:01:00.239> know<00:01:00.359> regular<00:01:00.570> fabric<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.230> prefer

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.979 
can use you know regular fabric I prefer
tights<00:01:02.149> so<00:01:03.149> you're<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.390> going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> cut<00:01:03.809> that

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
tights so you're just going to cut that

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:17.929 
tights so you're just going to cut that
out<00:01:14.509> and<00:01:16.040> then<00:01:17.040> once<00:01:17.250> you<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.580> it<00:01:17.610> cut<00:01:17.909> out

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
out and then once you have it cut out

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.480 
out and then once you have it cut out
you<00:01:18.780> want<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.140> fold<00:01:19.409> it<00:01:19.560> in<00:01:19.680> half<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:20.220> make<00:01:20.430> a

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
you want to fold it in half and make a

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.530 
you want to fold it in half and make a
mark<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.840> will<00:01:22.140> be<00:01:22.380> where<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:23.970> you

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
mark and this will be where your you

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.210 
mark and this will be where your you
know<00:01:24.689> your<00:01:25.020> measurements<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:25.979> start

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
know your measurements going to start

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.920 
know your measurements going to start
for<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.490> cut<00:01:26.729> it<00:01:26.759> into<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.090> triangle<00:01:27.450> shape

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
for you to cut it into a triangle shape

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.300 
for you to cut it into a triangle shape
and<00:01:29.750> basically<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.650> measure<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.130> out<00:01:32.250> and

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
and basically you measure it out and

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.060 
and basically you measure it out and
then<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.360> make<00:01:33.509> about<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.650> half<00:01:34.860> to

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
then you make about a one and a half to

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.710 
then you make about a one and a half to
two<00:01:35.250> inch<00:01:35.460> marking<00:01:35.939> on<00:01:36.090> there<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:36.450> you<00:01:36.570> can

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
two inch marking on there so you can

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.020 
two inch marking on there so you can
make<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> into<00:01:37.650> a<00:01:37.680> triangle<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.490> then<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.850> cut

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
make it into a triangle and then you cut

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:51.680 
make it into a triangle and then you cut
that<00:01:39.210> out<00:01:39.270> too

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:54.870 

and<00:01:52.690> I<00:01:52.750> did<00:01:53.020> two<00:01:53.200> versions<00:01:53.620> of<00:01:53.740> these<00:01:53.880> as

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
and I did two versions of these as

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.970 
and I did two versions of these as
you're<00:01:55.120> seeing<00:01:55.300> and<00:01:55.570> that's<00:01:55.660> clip<00:01:56.020> it'll<00:01:56.860> be<00:01:56.950> a

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:56.980 
you're seeing and that's clip it'll be a

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:59.220 
you're seeing and that's clip it'll be a
little<00:01:57.130> bit<00:01:57.340> shorter<00:01:57.790> and<00:01:58.750> you<00:01:59.050> know

00:01:59.220 --> 00:01:59.230 
little bit shorter and you know

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:01.500 
little bit shorter and you know
basically<00:01:59.950> it<00:02:00.220> is<00:02:00.370> so<00:02:00.640> easy<00:02:00.910> to<00:02:01.000> make<00:02:01.210> a<00:02:01.240> clip

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
basically it is so easy to make a clip

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.240 
basically it is so easy to make a clip
on<00:02:01.690> bang<00:02:01.930> all<00:02:02.200> you<00:02:02.350> have<00:02:02.500> to<00:02:02.680> do<00:02:02.830> once<00:02:03.100> you<00:02:03.220> have

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
on bang all you have to do once you have

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.640 
on bang all you have to do once you have
that<00:02:03.730> triangle<00:02:04.240> shape<00:02:04.450> cut<00:02:04.690> cut<00:02:05.200> out<00:02:05.320> all<00:02:05.500> you

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
that triangle shape cut cut out all you

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.010 
that triangle shape cut cut out all you
have<00:02:05.680> to<00:02:05.920> do<00:02:06.100> is<00:02:06.340> measure<00:02:06.910> your<00:02:07.060> tracks<00:02:07.479> along

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
the fabric and just glue you can make it

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.800 
the fabric and just glue you can make it
as<00:02:11.710> thin<00:02:12.040> or<00:02:12.280> as<00:02:12.520> full<00:02:12.820> as<00:02:13.030> you<00:02:13.150> want<00:02:13.360> to<00:02:13.540> of

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
course you know I had to make mine

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.970 
course you know I had to make mine
extra<00:02:15.970> hole<00:02:16.210> and<00:02:17.170> we<00:02:17.260> don't<00:02:17.440> have<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.770> worry

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
extra hole and we don't have to worry

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.370 
extra hole and we don't have to worry
about<00:02:18.160> you<00:02:18.760> know<00:02:18.880> blending<00:02:19.330> in<00:02:19.450> that<00:02:19.630> top<00:02:19.959> part

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
about you know blending in that top part

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.410 
about you know blending in that top part
where<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.220> track<00:02:21.490> is<00:02:21.700> because<00:02:22.030> that's<00:02:22.240> gonna

I actually did two versions of these I

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.370 
I actually did two versions of these I
did<00:02:41.770> one<00:02:42.160> with<00:02:42.430> just<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.239> regular<00:02:43.390> comb

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
did one with just a regular comb

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.850 
did one with just a regular comb
attachment<00:02:44.560> and<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.220> did<00:02:45.400> one<00:02:45.580> with<00:02:45.760> a<00:02:45.820> snap<00:02:46.180> one

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
so you see I did it with a comb

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.880 
so you see I did it with a comb
attachment<00:02:49.180> right<00:02:49.780> now<00:02:49.959> but<00:02:50.230> towards<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.709> end

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
attachment right now but towards the end

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.440 
attachment right now but towards the end
of<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.100> video<00:02:51.370> I<00:02:51.430> show<00:02:51.910> one<00:02:52.150> that<00:02:52.840> has<00:02:53.170> a
