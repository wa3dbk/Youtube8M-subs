00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
defenders just doing things that they

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.670 
defenders just doing things that they
just<00:02:21.420> wouldn't<00:02:21.660> do<00:02:21.840> in<00:02:21.960> real<00:02:22.110> life<00:02:22.170> it<00:02:22.650> just

just wouldn't do in real life it just
doesn't<00:02:23.070> make<00:02:23.190> sense<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.940> really<00:02:24.450> hope<00:02:24.540> they

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
doesn't make sense I really hope they

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.720 
doesn't make sense I really hope they
can<00:02:24.840> just<00:02:24.870> iron<00:02:25.410> out<00:02:25.590> some<00:02:25.620> of<00:02:25.980> those<00:02:26.100> like<00:02:26.400> old

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
can just iron out some of those like old

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.330 
can just iron out some of those like old
mistakes<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.780> defenders<00:02:28.200> do<00:02:28.410> and<00:02:28.680> just<00:02:29.100> give

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
mistakes that defenders do and just give

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.690 
mistakes that defenders do and just give
them<00:02:29.520> actual<00:02:29.940> real<00:02:30.150> intelligence<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.700> just

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
them actual real intelligence and just

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.670 
them actual real intelligence and just
so<00:02:32.820> it's<00:02:32.970> kind<00:02:33.180> of<00:02:33.300> less<00:02:33.540> frustrating<00:02:34.380> at<00:02:34.560> the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
so it's kind of less frustrating at the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.650 
so it's kind of less frustrating at the
back<00:02:34.890> at<00:02:35.100> least<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.550> mean<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.820> can<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.270> can<00:02:36.450> take

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
back at least I mean I can I can take

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.720 
back at least I mean I can I can take
conceding<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.320> goal<00:02:37.350> but<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:38.010> can<00:02:38.160> see<00:02:38.430> way<00:02:38.700> too

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
conceding a goal but I can see way too

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.790 
conceding a goal but I can see way too
many<00:02:38.940> goals<00:02:39.390> that<00:02:39.660> I<00:02:39.690> don't<00:02:39.930> need<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.230> concede

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
many goals that I don't need to concede

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.890 
many goals that I don't need to concede
if<00:02:41.040> you<00:02:41.130> get<00:02:41.250> what<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.400> mean<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:42.360> I'm<00:02:42.420> hoping<00:02:42.750> in

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
if you get what I mean so I'm hoping in

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.840 
if you get what I mean so I'm hoping in
improvements<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.710> the<00:02:43.800> defensive<00:02:44.400> side<00:02:44.610> of

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
improvements in the defensive side of

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.000 
improvements in the defensive side of
things<00:02:45.030> and<00:02:45.390> goal<00:02:46.380> is<00:02:46.530> and<00:02:46.650> things<00:02:46.830> like<00:02:46.950> that

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
things and goal is and things like that

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.500 
things and goal is and things like that
but<00:02:47.370> other<00:02:47.550> than<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:48.210> should<00:02:48.480> be

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
but other than that it should be

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:49.730 
but other than that it should be
interesting<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.080> see<00:02:49.200> what<00:02:49.230> they<00:02:49.440> can<00:02:49.530> come<00:02:49.590> up

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
interesting to see what they can come up

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.710 
interesting to see what they can come up
with<00:02:50.010> and<00:02:50.250> what<00:02:50.700> they<00:02:50.820> actually<00:02:50.940> do<00:02:51.270> reveal<00:02:51.540> at

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
with and what they actually do reveal at

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.060 
with and what they actually do reveal at
this<00:02:51.840> event<00:02:51.960> like<00:02:52.260> I've<00:02:52.410> said<00:02:52.590> we<00:02:52.740> normally

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
this event like I've said we normally

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.890
