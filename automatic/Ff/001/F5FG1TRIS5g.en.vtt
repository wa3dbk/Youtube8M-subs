00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:17.990 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.470 

now<00:00:18.890> we're<00:00:19.099> going<00:00:19.250> to<00:00:19.369> create<00:00:19.669> four<00:00:20.060> inside

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
now we're going to create four inside

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.900 
now we're going to create four inside
reverse<00:00:20.810> folds<00:00:21.259> we're<00:00:21.949> going<00:00:22.160> to<00:00:22.279> do<00:00:22.429> this<00:00:22.640> by

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:22.910 
reverse folds we're going to do this by

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.029 
reverse folds we're going to do this by
using<00:00:22.970> the<00:00:23.390> existing<00:00:23.660> creases<00:00:23.900> that<00:00:24.560> we<00:00:24.829> just

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
using the existing creases that we just

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.569 
using the existing creases that we just
made<00:00:25.809> so<00:00:26.809> what<00:00:27.169> we're<00:00:27.320> going<00:00:27.470> to<00:00:27.590> do<00:00:27.800> is<00:00:28.039> start

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:28.579 
made so what we're going to do is start

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.299 
made so what we're going to do is start
with<00:00:28.699> this<00:00:28.970> top<00:00:29.210> left<00:00:29.570> flap<00:00:29.840> and<00:00:30.079> we're<00:00:31.009> going

00:00:31.299 --> 00:00:31.309 
with this top left flap and we're going

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:33.970 
with this top left flap and we're going
to<00:00:31.519> make<00:00:32.300> sure<00:00:32.540> that<00:00:32.570> this<00:00:32.960> white<00:00:33.320> edge<00:00:33.500> here

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
to make sure that this white edge here

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.990 
to make sure that this white edge here
lines<00:00:34.610> up<00:00:34.820> with<00:00:35.030> this<00:00:35.239> edge<00:00:35.480> here<00:00:36.489> so<00:00:37.489> what<00:00:37.850> we

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
lines up with this edge here so what we

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.020 
lines up with this edge here so what we
do<00:00:38.180> is<00:00:38.449> we<00:00:39.110> sort<00:00:39.350> of<00:00:39.440> have<00:00:39.589> to<00:00:39.710> open<00:00:40.100> up<00:00:40.220> this

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
do is we sort of have to open up this

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.009 
do is we sort of have to open up this
pocket<00:00:41.659> and<00:00:42.040> just<00:00:43.040> push<00:00:43.370> this<00:00:43.699> down<00:00:44.030> so<00:00:44.839> that

00:00:45.009 --> 00:00:45.019 
pocket and just push this down so that

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.920 
pocket and just push this down so that
it<00:00:45.140> aligns<00:00:45.440> with<00:00:46.149> the<00:00:47.149> white<00:00:47.360> edge<00:00:47.600> down<00:00:47.870> here

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
it aligns with the white edge down here

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.919 
it aligns with the white edge down here
and<00:00:48.379> you<00:00:49.339> should<00:00:49.550> see<00:00:49.760> a<00:00:49.790> crease<00:00:50.149> like<00:00:50.899> this

00:00:50.919 --> 00:00:50.929 
and you should see a crease like this

00:00:50.929 --> 00:00:54.220 
and you should see a crease like this
and<00:00:51.699> it'll<00:00:52.699> be<00:00:52.940> right<00:00:53.120> here<00:00:53.179> and<00:00:53.690> what<00:00:53.960> you<00:00:54.050> do

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
and it'll be right here and what you do

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.139 
and it'll be right here and what you do
is<00:00:54.440> just<00:00:54.649> push<00:00:54.890> inwards<00:00:55.370> along<00:00:55.699> that<00:00:55.910> crease

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
is just push inwards along that crease

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.540 
is just push inwards along that crease
and<00:00:56.329> then<00:00:57.050> flatten<00:00:57.620> the<00:00:57.710> model<00:00:57.829> and<00:00:58.219> it<00:00:58.370> you

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
and then flatten the model and it you

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.160 
and then flatten the model and it you
should<00:00:58.760> have<00:00:58.879> done<00:00:59.059> your<00:00:59.510> inside<00:00:59.839> reverse

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
should have done your inside reverse

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.829 
should have done your inside reverse
fold<00:01:00.789> so<00:01:01.789> you<00:01:01.850> do<00:01:02.030> the<00:01:02.149> same<00:01:02.329> thing<00:01:02.570> over<00:01:02.719> here

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
fold so you do the same thing over here

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.490 
fold so you do the same thing over here
and<00:01:03.369> just<00:01:04.369> an<00:01:04.519> easier<00:01:04.820> method<00:01:05.269> to<00:01:05.390> do<00:01:05.570> this<00:01:05.750> it

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
and just an easier method to do this it

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.100 
and just an easier method to do this it
might<00:01:06.710> help<00:01:06.950> it<00:01:07.190> might<00:01:07.369> not<00:01:07.600> you<00:01:08.600> can<00:01:08.810> just

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
might help it might not you can just

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.830 
might help it might not you can just
basically<00:01:09.440> push<00:01:10.220> here<00:01:10.820> and<00:01:11.530> it<00:01:12.530> should<00:01:12.890> just

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
basically push here and it should just

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.809 
basically push here and it should just
collapse<00:01:14.840> along<00:01:15.080> the<00:01:15.380> existing<00:01:15.500> creases<00:01:16.130> if

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:16.819 
collapse along the existing creases if

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:19.090 
collapse along the existing creases if
the<00:01:17.509> other<00:01:17.630> method<00:01:18.350> doesn't<00:01:18.530> work<00:01:18.800> for<00:01:18.979> you

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
the other method doesn't work for you

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.020 
the other method doesn't work for you
then<00:01:19.130> that<00:01:19.759> should<00:01:19.970> work<00:01:20.179> so<00:01:21.640> now<00:01:22.640> we're<00:01:23.000> just

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
then that should work so now we're just

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.969 
then that should work so now we're just
going<00:01:23.390> to<00:01:23.450> do<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:23.720> first<00:01:23.869> method<00:01:24.320> method<00:01:24.860> on

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
going to do the first method method on

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.370 
going to do the first method method on
both<00:01:25.159> of<00:01:25.369> these<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:26.479> let's<00:01:26.930> start<00:01:27.200> by<00:01:27.350> opening

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:27.380 
both of these so let's start by opening

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.050 
both of these so let's start by opening
this<00:01:27.860> flap<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.159> bit<00:01:28.490> and<00:01:29.079> just<00:01:30.079> push<00:01:30.439> in

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
this flap a bit and just push in

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.179 
this flap a bit and just push in
aligning<00:01:32.060> that<00:01:32.930> edge<00:01:33.290> with<00:01:33.649> the<00:01:33.799> other<00:01:33.920> edge

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
aligning that edge with the other edge

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.230 
aligning that edge with the other edge
and<00:01:35.290> again<00:01:36.290> just<00:01:36.950> push<00:01:37.280> in<00:01:37.460> along<00:01:37.729> that<00:01:37.939> crease

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
and again just push in along that crease

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.440 
and again just push in along that crease
there<00:01:38.540> and<00:01:39.159> flatten<00:01:40.159> it<00:01:40.250> out<00:01:40.460> and<00:01:41.030> it<00:01:41.270> should

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
there and flatten it out and it should

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.899 
there and flatten it out and it should
look<00:01:41.570> like<00:01:41.630> that<00:01:42.399> then<00:01:43.399> do<00:01:43.549> the<00:01:43.640> same<00:01:43.850> thing

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
look like that then do the same thing

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.649 
look like that then do the same thing
one<00:01:44.270> more<00:01:44.420> times<00:01:44.689> so<00:01:45.259> open<00:01:45.619> up<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:45.860> flap<00:01:46.070> a<00:01:46.100> bit

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:46.659 
one more times so open up the flap a bit

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.499 
one more times so open up the flap a bit
push<00:01:47.659> this<00:01:47.899> in<00:01:48.700> so<00:01:49.700> that<00:01:49.909> the<00:01:50.090> crease<00:01:50.329> is

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
push this in so that the crease is

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.940 
push this in so that the crease is
aligned<00:01:50.840> and<00:01:51.140> then<00:01:51.979> just<00:01:52.369> put<00:01:53.360> that<00:01:53.680> there<00:01:54.680> and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
aligned and then just put that there and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.920 
aligned and then just put that there and
flatten<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.490> whole<00:01:55.670> thing<00:01:55.909> out<00:01:56.119> so<00:01:56.600> it<00:01:56.750> should

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
flatten the whole thing out so it should

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:03.100 
flatten the whole thing out so it should
look<00:01:56.960> like<00:01:57.140> this

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.530 

now<00:02:04.040> we're<00:02:04.250> going<00:02:04.400> to<00:02:04.520> create<00:02:04.790> four<00:02:05.240> more

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:05.540 
now we're going to create four more

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.590 
now we're going to create four more
inside<00:02:05.960> reverse<00:02:06.320> folds<00:02:06.770> so<00:02:07.330> what<00:02:08.330> we're<00:02:08.479> going

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
inside reverse folds so what we're going

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.690 
inside reverse folds so what we're going
to<00:02:08.720> do<00:02:08.960> is<00:02:09.229> we're<00:02:09.920> going<00:02:10.009> to<00:02:10.070> start<00:02:10.340> with<00:02:10.520> this

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
to do is we're going to start with this

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.110 
to do is we're going to start with this
top<00:02:10.970> left<00:02:11.300> area<00:02:11.690> up<00:02:11.870> here<00:02:12.580> we're<00:02:13.580> not<00:02:13.700> going<00:02:14.000> to

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
top left area up here we're not going to

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.090 
top left area up here we're not going to
go<00:02:14.270> in<00:02:14.480> this<00:02:14.660> region<00:02:15.050> over<00:02:15.260> here<00:02:15.290> but<00:02:15.920> we're

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
go in this region over here but we're

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.650 
go in this region over here but we're
just<00:02:16.130> going<00:02:16.430> to<00:02:16.550> use<00:02:16.640> this<00:02:17.030> little<00:02:17.240> square

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
just going to use this little square

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.190 
just going to use this little square
here<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:19.580> along<00:02:20.150> this<00:02:20.360> crease<00:02:20.690> that<00:02:20.900> we<00:02:21.050> have

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
here so along this crease that we have

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.710 
here so along this crease that we have
here<00:02:21.530> the<00:02:21.680> diagonal<00:02:22.250> crease<00:02:22.490> were<00:02:23.360> basically

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
here the diagonal crease were basically

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.600 
here the diagonal crease were basically
just<00:02:23.840> going<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.530> pinch<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.010> like<00:02:25.070> a<00:02:25.220> mountain

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
just going to pinch it like a mountain

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.140 
just going to pinch it like a mountain
fold<00:02:26.770> so<00:02:27.770> it<00:02:28.100> should<00:02:28.310> look<00:02:28.340> like<00:02:28.580> a<00:02:28.760> mountain

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
fold so it should look like a mountain

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:30.540 
fold so it should look like a mountain
when<00:02:29.300> you<00:02:29.390> look<00:02:29.600> at<00:02:29.750> it<00:02:29.840> from<00:02:29.960> the<00:02:30.110> side<00:02:30.320> and

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
when you look at it from the side and

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.310 
when you look at it from the side and
then<00:02:31.550> what<00:02:31.790> you<00:02:31.880> have<00:02:31.910> to<00:02:32.060> do<00:02:32.270> is<00:02:32.540> take<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.080> top

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
then what you have to do is take the top

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.040 
then what you have to do is take the top
part<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.830> where<00:02:34.070> it's<00:02:34.190> pinched<00:02:34.610> and<00:02:34.820> just<00:02:35.720> drag

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
part of where it's pinched and just drag

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.930 
part of where it's pinched and just drag
it<00:02:36.200> over<00:02:36.320> into<00:02:36.500> this<00:02:36.920> region<00:02:37.190> as<00:02:37.460> far<00:02:37.670> as<00:02:37.790> it

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
it over into this region as far as it

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.070 
it over into this region as far as it
goes<00:02:38.120> and<00:02:39.700> when<00:02:40.700> you're<00:02:40.820> doing<00:02:40.970> that<00:02:41.270> try<00:02:42.020> to

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
goes and when you're doing that try to

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.580 
goes and when you're doing that try to
align<00:02:42.500> this<00:02:42.830> edge<00:02:43.070> here<00:02:43.570> with<00:02:44.570> that<00:02:44.840> white

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
align this edge here with that white

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.220 
align this edge here with that white
edge<00:02:45.830> there<00:02:46.240> so<00:02:47.240> when<00:02:47.390> you<00:02:47.510> do<00:02:47.720> that

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
edge there so when you do that

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.030 
edge there so when you do that
it<00:02:48.290> should<00:02:48.770> look<00:02:48.950> like<00:02:49.209> triangle<00:02:50.860> once<00:02:51.860> it's

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
it should look like triangle once it's

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.170 
it should look like triangle once it's
like<00:02:52.220> that<00:02:52.459> just<00:02:52.820> fold<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.270> edge<00:02:53.390> over<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:55.640> it

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
like that just fold the edge over and it

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.620 
like that just fold the edge over and it
should<00:02:56.420> look<00:02:56.630> like<00:02:56.690> that<00:02:58.150> now<00:02:59.150> you<00:02:59.270> have<00:02:59.390> to<00:02:59.480> do

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
should look like that now you have to do

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.690 
should look like that now you have to do
the<00:02:59.750> same<00:02:59.959> thing<00:03:00.170> over<00:03:00.290> here<00:03:00.410> so<00:03:01.310> start<00:03:01.640> by

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
the same thing over here so start by

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.520 
the same thing over here so start by
making<00:03:02.030> this<00:03:02.330> a<00:03:02.510> mountain<00:03:02.840> fold<00:03:03.020> so<00:03:03.320> just

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
making this a mountain fold so just

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.550 
making this a mountain fold so just
pinch<00:03:03.890> it<00:03:04.040> from<00:03:04.220> the<00:03:04.310> top<00:03:04.520> and<00:03:04.970> just<00:03:05.410> drag<00:03:06.410> it

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
pinch it from the top and just drag it

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.280 
pinch it from the top and just drag it
over<00:03:06.709> and<00:03:07.450> align<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:09.500> two<00:03:09.709> edges<00:03:09.950> here<00:03:10.430> and

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
over and align the two edges here and

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.830 
over and align the two edges here and
then<00:03:12.290> just<00:03:12.590> make<00:03:12.769> a<00:03:12.800> crease<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.660> you<00:03:14.660> should

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:14.840 
then just make a crease and you should

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.320 
then just make a crease and you should
have<00:03:14.930> that<00:03:15.140> triangle<00:03:15.590> again<00:03:16.090> once<00:03:17.090> you<00:03:17.209> have

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
have that triangle again once you have

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.960 
have that triangle again once you have
the<00:03:17.450> triangle<00:03:17.750> just<00:03:18.680> fold<00:03:18.980> across<00:03:19.430> on<00:03:19.790> this

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
the triangle just fold across on this

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.520 
the triangle just fold across on this
crease<00:03:20.300> just<00:03:20.980> like<00:03:21.980> that<00:03:22.220> and<00:03:22.840> then<00:03:23.840> it's<00:03:24.290> done

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
crease just like that and then it's done

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.400 
crease just like that and then it's done
on<00:03:24.590> this<00:03:24.860> side<00:03:25.630> so<00:03:26.630> now<00:03:26.780> I'll<00:03:26.900> just<00:03:27.050> flip<00:03:27.290> the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:27.410 
on this side so now I'll just flip the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:30.040 
on this side so now I'll just flip the
model<00:03:27.590> over<00:03:27.860> and<00:03:28.570> we're<00:03:29.570> doing<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.840> same

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
model over and we're doing the same

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.770 
model over and we're doing the same
thing<00:03:30.260> on<00:03:30.350> this<00:03:30.560> side<00:03:30.880> so<00:03:31.880> let's<00:03:32.390> start<00:03:32.660> by

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
thing on this side so let's start by

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.449 
thing on this side so let's start by
making<00:03:33.110> this<00:03:33.230> a<00:03:33.290> mountain<00:03:33.680> fold<00:03:33.830> again<00:03:35.019> and

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
making this a mountain fold again and

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.949 
making this a mountain fold again and
we're<00:03:37.459> just<00:03:37.550> going<00:03:37.760> to<00:03:38.000> pull<00:03:38.209> over<00:03:38.420> as<00:03:38.690> far<00:03:38.900> as

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
we're just going to pull over as far as

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.320 
we're just going to pull over as far as
it<00:03:39.170> goes<00:03:39.640> and<00:03:41.140> just<00:03:42.140> make<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:42.380> crease<00:03:43.060> and<00:03:44.060> again

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
it goes and just make a crease and again

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:47.300 
it goes and just make a crease and again
fold<00:03:44.600> this<00:03:44.750> back<00:03:44.959> over

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
fold this back over

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.160 
fold this back over
one<00:03:48.310> more<00:03:48.520> time<00:03:49.060> we're<00:03:49.540> just<00:03:49.660> going<00:03:49.960> to<00:03:50.020> make

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
one more time we're just going to make

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.130 
one more time we're just going to make
this<00:03:50.320> piece<00:03:50.740> a<00:03:50.770> mountain<00:03:51.190> fold<00:03:51.400> and<00:03:51.960> drag<00:03:52.960> it

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
this piece a mountain fold and drag it

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.250 
this piece a mountain fold and drag it
over<00:03:53.260> into<00:03:53.710> that<00:03:53.740> region<00:03:54.280> over<00:03:54.520> there<00:03:55.260> make

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
over into that region over there make

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.230 
over into that region over there make
sure<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.590> edge<00:03:56.740> is<00:03:56.770> aligned<00:03:57.220> make<00:03:57.850> a<00:03:57.880> crease

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
sure the edge is aligned make a crease

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.340 
sure the edge is aligned make a crease
and<00:03:58.540> then<00:03:58.960> fold<00:03:59.920> back<00:04:00.160> over<00:04:00.490> and<00:04:01.320> you<00:04:02.320> should

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
and then fold back over and you should

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.500 
and then fold back over and you should
sort<00:04:02.800> of<00:04:02.950> see<00:04:03.100> how<00:04:03.130> the<00:04:03.460> heart<00:04:04.060> shape<00:04:04.330> is

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
sort of see how the heart shape is

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.760 
sort of see how the heart shape is
starting<00:04:04.930> to<00:04:05.050> form

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:13.290 

now<00:04:11.770> we're<00:04:11.980> going<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:12.280> use<00:04:12.460> these<00:04:12.730> four<00:04:13.030> flaps

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
now we're going to use these four flaps

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.660 
now we're going to use these four flaps
that<00:04:13.630> we<00:04:13.720> created<00:04:14.110> and<00:04:14.440> we're<00:04:15.190> just<00:04:15.310> going<00:04:15.520> to

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:15.670 
that we created and we're just going to

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:18.780 
that we created and we're just going to
put<00:04:15.850> them<00:04:15.970> inside<00:04:16.180> each<00:04:16.660> pocket<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:18.340> to<00:04:18.400> do

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
put them inside each pocket so to do

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.850 
put them inside each pocket so to do
this<00:04:19.000> let's<00:04:19.270> start<00:04:19.780> with<00:04:19.959> this<00:04:20.170> top<00:04:20.530> left

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:20.860 
this let's start with this top left

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.860 
this let's start with this top left
pocket<00:04:21.370> and<00:04:21.580> we<00:04:22.360> just<00:04:22.600> open<00:04:23.140> it<00:04:23.230> up<00:04:23.350> a<00:04:23.500> bit<00:04:23.530> and

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
pocket and we just open it up a bit and

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.450 
pocket and we just open it up a bit and
don't<00:04:25.870> unfold<00:04:26.350> any<00:04:26.620> of<00:04:26.740> the<00:04:26.860> creases<00:04:27.130> that<00:04:27.310> we

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
don't unfold any of the creases that we

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.850 
don't unfold any of the creases that we
made<00:04:27.730> before<00:04:27.880> but<00:04:28.870> sort<00:04:29.170> of<00:04:29.260> just<00:04:29.440> pull<00:04:29.650> it<00:04:29.770> up

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
made before but sort of just pull it up

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.380 
made before but sort of just pull it up
so<00:04:30.100> that<00:04:30.280> you<00:04:30.370> have<00:04:30.490> room<00:04:30.670> to<00:04:30.880> put<00:04:31.060> the<00:04:31.180> flap

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
so that you have room to put the flap

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.890 
so that you have room to put the flap
inside<00:04:31.920> so<00:04:32.920> once<00:04:33.520> it's<00:04:33.730> like<00:04:33.880> this<00:04:34.150> just<00:04:34.600> take

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
inside so once it's like this just take

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.760 
inside so once it's like this just take
this<00:04:35.110> flap<00:04:35.410> here<00:04:35.740> and<00:04:35.950> push<00:04:36.820> it<00:04:36.970> inside<00:04:37.330> and

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
this flap here and push it inside and

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.990 
this flap here and push it inside and
then<00:04:38.770> it<00:04:38.890> should<00:04:39.040> fall<00:04:39.280> upon<00:04:39.610> one<00:04:39.820> of<00:04:39.910> the

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.000 
then it should fall upon one of the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.330 
then it should fall upon one of the
creases<00:04:40.390> we<00:04:40.510> just<00:04:40.540> made<00:04:40.960> and<00:04:41.230> then<00:04:42.100> just

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
creases we just made and then just

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.700 
creases we just made and then just
flatten<00:04:42.700> it<00:04:42.790> out<00:04:42.910> so<00:04:43.210> that<00:04:44.080> the<00:04:44.320> whole<00:04:44.470> model

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
flatten it out so that the whole model

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.400 
flatten it out so that the whole model
lies<00:04:44.980> flat<00:04:45.250> and<00:04:46.120> you<00:04:46.660> do<00:04:46.810> the<00:04:46.930> same<00:04:47.110> thing<00:04:47.320> on

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
lies flat and you do the same thing on

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.740 
lies flat and you do the same thing on
this<00:04:47.560> side<00:04:47.620> so<00:04:48.400> just<00:04:48.670> pull<00:04:48.880> open<00:04:49.150> this<00:04:49.510> pocket

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
this side so just pull open this pocket

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.660 
this side so just pull open this pocket
and<00:04:50.880> then<00:04:51.880> push<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.390> flap<00:04:52.630> in<00:04:52.870> and<00:04:53.520> again<00:04:54.520> it

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:54.670 
and then push the flap in and again it

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.310 
and then push the flap in and again it
should<00:04:54.820> follow<00:04:55.030> up<00:04:55.210> on<00:04:55.420> one<00:04:55.690> of<00:04:55.720> our<00:04:55.870> creases

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
should follow up on one of our creases

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.090 
should follow up on one of our creases
that<00:04:56.350> we<00:04:56.500> just<00:04:56.740> made<00:04:57.930> okay<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:59.230> now<00:04:59.500> once<00:04:59.890> it's

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
that we just made okay and now once it's

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.390 
that we just made okay and now once it's
like<00:05:00.280> this<00:05:00.490> we<00:05:00.790> just<00:05:00.820> flip<00:05:01.240> it<00:05:01.390> over<00:05:01.540> and<00:05:02.280> we<00:05:03.280> do

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
like this we just flip it over and we do

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.970 
like this we just flip it over and we do
the<00:05:03.520> same<00:05:03.730> thing<00:05:03.940> on<00:05:04.030> the<00:05:04.150> back<00:05:04.350> so<00:05:05.350> let's

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
the same thing on the back so let's

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.980 
the same thing on the back so let's
start<00:05:06.250> over<00:05:06.370> here<00:05:06.730> and<00:05:06.940> we<00:05:07.120> just<00:05:07.360> open<00:05:07.900> the

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
start over here and we just open the

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.800 
start over here and we just open the
pocket<00:05:08.350> up<00:05:08.470> put<00:05:08.850> the<00:05:09.850> flap<00:05:10.060> inside<00:05:10.270> and

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
pocket up put the flap inside and

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.180 
pocket up put the flap inside and
flatten<00:05:11.590> the<00:05:11.680> model<00:05:11.830> and<00:05:12.900> one<00:05:13.900> last<00:05:14.080> time<00:05:14.440> open

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.190 
flatten the model and one last time open

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.380 
flatten the model and one last time open
up<00:05:15.310> the<00:05:15.460> pocket<00:05:15.690> put<00:05:16.690> the<00:05:16.780> flap<00:05:17.020> inside<00:05:17.230> and

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
up the pocket put the flap inside and

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:25.469 
up the pocket put the flap inside and
flatten<00:05:19.390> it<00:05:19.480> out

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:25.479 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.269 

now<00:05:26.020> we're<00:05:26.229> going<00:05:26.499> to<00:05:26.590> unfold<00:05:26.740> the<00:05:27.129> model

00:05:27.269 --> 00:05:27.279 
now we're going to unfold the model

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:29.339 
now we're going to unfold the model
along<00:05:27.789> the<00:05:27.969> center<00:05:28.330> crease<00:05:28.509> that<00:05:29.080> we<00:05:29.169> made

00:05:29.339 --> 00:05:29.349 
along the center crease that we made

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:32.399 
along the center crease that we made
before<00:05:29.499> so<00:05:30.539> basically<00:05:31.539> what<00:05:31.779> we<00:05:31.900> do<00:05:32.080> is<00:05:32.379> just

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:32.409 
before so basically what we do is just

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.369 
before so basically what we do is just
pull<00:05:32.860> both<00:05:33.340> apart<00:05:33.759> so<00:05:34.419> it<00:05:34.719> looks<00:05:34.930> like<00:05:35.050> this

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:35.379 
pull both apart so it looks like this

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:42.240 
pull both apart so it looks like this
again

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.980 

once<00:05:43.250> it<00:05:43.430> looks<00:05:43.550> like<00:05:43.789> this<00:05:44.060> we're<00:05:44.629> basically

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
once it looks like this we're basically

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.260 
once it looks like this we're basically
going<00:05:45.379> to<00:05:45.500> create<00:05:45.740> a<00:05:45.949> waterbomb<00:05:46.520> base<00:05:46.580> along

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
going to create a waterbomb base along

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.339 
going to create a waterbomb base along
these<00:05:47.810> four<00:05:48.139> creases<00:05:48.889> here<00:05:49.960> you<00:05:50.960> can<00:05:51.139> probably

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
these four creases here you can probably

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.140 
these four creases here you can probably
already<00:05:51.770> see<00:05:51.949> how<00:05:52.310> we're<00:05:52.490> going<00:05:52.639> to<00:05:52.759> do<00:05:52.969> this

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
already see how we're going to do this

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.020 
already see how we're going to do this
but<00:05:53.870> just<00:05:53.900> in<00:05:54.229> case<00:05:54.439> you<00:05:54.620> don't<00:05:54.770> then<00:05:55.460> let's

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
but just in case you don't then let's

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.809 
but just in case you don't then let's
just<00:05:56.300> do<00:05:56.539> this<00:05:56.689> together<00:05:56.930> so<00:05:57.550> start<00:05:58.550> by

00:05:58.809 --> 00:05:58.819 
just do this together so start by

00:05:58.819 --> 00:06:00.909 
just do this together so start by
folding<00:05:59.090> in<00:05:59.330> half<00:05:59.360> along<00:05:59.990> this<00:06:00.259> long<00:06:00.530> crease

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
folding in half along this long crease

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:04.540 
folding in half along this long crease
here<00:06:01.219> and<00:06:02.560> the<00:06:03.560> model<00:06:03.830> should<00:06:03.979> look<00:06:04.039> something

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:04.550 
here and the model should look something

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:08.140 
here and the model should look something
like<00:06:04.729> this<00:06:05.259> and<00:06:06.259> then<00:06:07.189> now<00:06:07.370> what<00:06:07.550> we<00:06:07.729> do<00:06:07.939> is

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
like this and then now what we do is

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:10.990 
like this and then now what we do is
we're<00:06:08.930> going<00:06:09.080> to<00:06:09.199> create<00:06:09.500> two<00:06:09.860> squash<00:06:10.550> folds

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:11.000 
we're going to create two squash folds

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.529 
we're going to create two squash folds
so<00:06:11.960> along<00:06:12.409> this<00:06:12.620> crease<00:06:12.979> here<00:06:13.389> we're<00:06:14.389> just

00:06:14.529 --> 00:06:14.539 
so along this crease here we're just

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.089 
so along this crease here we're just
going<00:06:14.780> to<00:06:14.840> pull<00:06:15.110> this<00:06:15.469> side<00:06:15.710> of<00:06:15.860> the<00:06:15.919> model

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 
going to pull this side of the model

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:19.779 
going to pull this side of the model
over<00:06:16.990> just<00:06:17.990> fold<00:06:18.289> it<00:06:18.440> over<00:06:18.590> a<00:06:18.740> bit<00:06:18.979> and<00:06:19.190> it

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:19.789 
over just fold it over a bit and it

00:06:19.789 --> 00:06:22.320 
over just fold it over a bit and it
should<00:06:19.969> just<00:06:20.120> squash<00:06:20.419> down<00:06:20.719> naturally<00:06:21.050> and

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
should just squash down naturally and

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.430 
should just squash down naturally and
you'll<00:06:23.330> know<00:06:23.479> you've<00:06:23.690> done<00:06:23.719> it<00:06:24.020> right<00:06:24.169> when<00:06:24.409> it

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:24.440 
you'll know you've done it right when it

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.339 
you'll know you've done it right when it
looks<00:06:24.710> like<00:06:24.860> a<00:06:24.889> heart<00:06:25.190> and<00:06:25.810> then<00:06:26.810> just<00:06:27.080> flip

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
looks like a heart and then just flip

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:30.790 
looks like a heart and then just flip
the<00:06:27.469> model<00:06:27.650> over<00:06:27.889> and<00:06:29.050> you<00:06:30.050> can<00:06:30.229> do<00:06:30.469> the<00:06:30.590> same

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:30.800 
the model over and you can do the same

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.040 
the model over and you can do the same
thing<00:06:31.039> again<00:06:31.159> along<00:06:32.030> this<00:06:32.210> crease<00:06:32.569> and<00:06:32.900> this

00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.050 
thing again along this crease and this

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.769 
thing again along this crease and this
crease<00:06:33.110> so<00:06:34.029> basically<00:06:35.029> just<00:06:35.120> put<00:06:35.449> your<00:06:35.569> hand

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:35.779 
crease so basically just put your hand

00:06:35.779 --> 00:06:38.080 
crease so basically just put your hand
inside<00:06:35.960> this<00:06:36.289> flap<00:06:36.560> and<00:06:36.979> along<00:06:37.610> this<00:06:37.759> crease

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.090 
inside this flap and along this crease

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:40.749 
inside this flap and along this crease
we're<00:06:38.389> just<00:06:38.539> going<00:06:38.750> to<00:06:38.810> fold<00:06:39.080> the<00:06:40.069> model<00:06:40.219> over

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:40.759 
we're just going to fold the model over

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:46.300 
we're just going to fold the model over
and<00:06:42.550> splatting<00:06:43.550> it<00:06:43.639> out<00:06:43.819> and<00:06:44.919> it<00:06:45.919> should<00:06:46.129> look

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.310 
and splatting it out and it should look

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:52.980 
and splatting it out and it should look
like<00:06:46.370> this

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:52.990 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.110 

now<00:06:53.650> there's<00:06:53.889> only<00:06:54.039> two<00:06:54.370> more<00:06:54.580> things<00:06:54.789> that<00:06:55.030> we

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:55.120 
now there's only two more things that we

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.900 
now there's only two more things that we
have<00:06:55.210> to<00:06:55.360> do<00:06:55.509> before<00:06:55.870> this<00:06:55.990> model<00:06:56.350> is<00:06:56.470> complete

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:56.910 
have to do before this model is complete

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.310 
have to do before this model is complete
we<00:06:57.910> basically<00:06:58.270> just<00:06:58.419> have<00:06:58.720> to<00:06:58.840> look<00:06:58.990> at<00:06:59.199> it

00:06:59.310 --> 00:06:59.320 
we basically just have to look at it

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.230 
we basically just have to look at it
from<00:06:59.440> the<00:06:59.590> top<00:06:59.800> and<00:07:00.070> we're<00:07:00.699> going<00:07:00.850> to<00:07:01.060> put

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 
from the top and we're going to put

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.840 
from the top and we're going to put
these<00:07:01.419> two<00:07:01.720> flaps<00:07:02.020> underneath<00:07:02.639> two<00:07:03.639> other

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:03.850 
these two flaps underneath two other

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:07.110 
these two flaps underneath two other
flaps<00:07:04.530> so<00:07:05.530> let's<00:07:05.949> start<00:07:06.250> by<00:07:06.430> taking<00:07:06.610> this

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:07.120 
flaps so let's start by taking this

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.080 
flaps so let's start by taking this
right<00:07:07.509> flap<00:07:07.840> here<00:07:08.110> and<00:07:08.490> we're<00:07:09.490> going<00:07:09.699> to<00:07:09.850> open

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.090 
right flap here and we're going to open

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:14.360 
right flap here and we're going to open
up<00:07:11.009> this<00:07:12.009> flap<00:07:12.340> that<00:07:12.370> we<00:07:12.759> made<00:07:12.970> up<00:07:13.150> front<00:07:13.479> and

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
up this flap that we made up front and

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.090 
up this flap that we made up front and
we<00:07:15.370> just<00:07:15.580> hold<00:07:15.789> that<00:07:15.850> up<00:07:16.060> for<00:07:16.270> a<00:07:16.300> second<00:07:16.720> and

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:17.100 
we just hold that up for a second and

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:21.659 
we just hold that up for a second and
just<00:07:18.449> let<00:07:19.449> this<00:07:19.720> go<00:07:20.440> over<00:07:20.919> to<00:07:21.070> the<00:07:21.190> side<00:07:21.430> that

00:07:21.659 --> 00:07:21.669 
just let this go over to the side that

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:24.210 
just let this go over to the side that
you<00:07:21.789> want<00:07:21.970> it<00:07:22.060> on<00:07:22.180> and<00:07:22.620> once<00:07:23.620> it's<00:07:23.830> like<00:07:24.009> that

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:24.220 
you want it on and once it's like that

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.460 
you want it on and once it's like that
put<00:07:24.460> that<00:07:24.639> flap<00:07:24.880> back<00:07:25.090> down<00:07:25.360> and<00:07:25.690> it<00:07:25.870> should<00:07:26.289> be

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:26.470 
put that flap back down and it should be

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:28.909 
put that flap back down and it should be
like<00:07:26.650> this<00:07:26.860> and<00:07:27.130> it<00:07:27.370> should<00:07:27.550> lock<00:07:27.970> a<00:07:28.000> bit<00:07:28.330> and

00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 
like this and it should lock a bit and

00:07:28.919 --> 00:07:31.379 
like this and it should lock a bit and
now<00:07:29.919> what<00:07:30.130> we<00:07:30.250> have<00:07:30.280> to<00:07:30.490> do<00:07:30.639> is<00:07:30.880> do<00:07:31.060> the<00:07:31.210> same

00:07:31.379 --> 00:07:31.389 
now what we have to do is do the same

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:33.600 
now what we have to do is do the same
thing<00:07:31.660> on<00:07:31.780> this<00:07:32.020> side<00:07:32.259> so<00:07:32.949> we're<00:07:33.099> going<00:07:33.130> to<00:07:33.370> put

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:33.610 
thing on this side so we're going to put

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.170 
thing on this side so we're going to put
this<00:07:33.910> flap<00:07:34.300> underneath<00:07:34.990> this<00:07:35.289> flap<00:07:35.940> so<00:07:36.940> just

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.180 
this flap underneath this flap so just

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.770 
this flap underneath this flap so just
open<00:07:37.930> this<00:07:38.050> up<00:07:38.729> this<00:07:39.729> one<00:07:39.970> flap<00:07:40.270> here<00:07:40.570> and

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:40.780 
open this up this one flap here and

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.870 
open this up this one flap here and
we're<00:07:41.440> just<00:07:41.470> going<00:07:41.860> to<00:07:41.889> basically<00:07:42.370> pull<00:07:42.729> the

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:42.880 
we're just going to basically pull the

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:45.480 
we're just going to basically pull the
model<00:07:43.150> together<00:07:43.330> and<00:07:43.889> fold<00:07:44.889> the<00:07:45.039> flap<00:07:45.250> back

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.950 
model together and fold the flap back
down<00:07:46.949> once<00:07:47.949> it's<00:07:48.160> like<00:07:48.370> that<00:07:48.639> our<00:07:48.910> model<00:07:49.900> is

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:49.960 
down once it's like that our model is

00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.410 
down once it's like that our model is
complete
