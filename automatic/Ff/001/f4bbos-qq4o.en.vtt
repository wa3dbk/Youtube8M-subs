00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
unblock the next room by the way for the

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.410 
unblock the next room by the way for the
next<00:01:13.710> upcoming<00:01:13.979> part<00:01:14.520> next<00:01:15.150> thing<00:01:15.330> you're

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
next upcoming part next thing you're

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.780 
next upcoming part next thing you're
going<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.720> is<00:01:15.840> kill<00:01:16.020> yourself<00:01:16.350> but

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
going to do is kill yourself but

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.149 
going to do is kill yourself but
basically<00:01:17.790> this<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.990> perfect<00:01:19.590> run<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
basically this is a perfect run of the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.469 
basically this is a perfect run of the
map<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.450> cleverly<00:01:21.840> edited<00:01:22.080> together

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
map that I so cleverly edited together

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.249 
map that I so cleverly edited together
because<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:24.780> kind<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.170> based<00:01:25.409> on<00:01:25.619> spawns<00:01:26.159> of

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
because it's kind of based on spawns of

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:30.109 
because it's kind of based on spawns of
like<00:01:28.259> if<00:01:28.439> you<00:01:28.619> spawn<00:01:28.920> in<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.130> right<00:01:29.310> place<00:01:29.579> so

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
like if you spawn in the right place so

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.030 
like if you spawn in the right place so
there<00:01:30.450> were<00:01:30.600> multiple<00:01:31.110> oh<00:01:31.380> I<00:01:31.470> have<00:01:31.740> to<00:01:31.799> kill

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
there were multiple oh I have to kill

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.190 
there were multiple oh I have to kill
myself<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:32.520> type<00:01:33.240> parts<00:01:33.689> so<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.020> is<00:01:34.170> a

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
myself now type parts so this is a

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.859 
myself now type parts so this is a
perfect<00:01:34.740> run<00:01:34.890> through<00:01:35.159> and<00:01:35.630> yeah<00:01:36.630> I<00:01:36.659> just

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
perfect run through and yeah I just

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.190 
perfect run through and yeah I just
wanted<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.229> get<00:01:37.350> that<00:01:37.409> out<00:01:37.590> of<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.860> way

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
wanted to get that out of the way

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.300 
wanted to get that out of the way
because<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.320> know<00:01:40.380> none<00:01:40.680> of<00:01:40.710> you<00:01:40.920> would<00:01:41.040> notice

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
because I know none of you would notice

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.530 
because I know none of you would notice
because<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.210> editing<00:01:42.600> is<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.259> amazing

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
because the editing is just that amazing

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.120 
because the editing is just that amazing
you<00:01:45.540> know<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:45.720> can't<00:01:46.079> really<00:01:46.470> notice<00:01:46.770> if<00:01:47.100> you

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
you know you can't really notice if you

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.670 
you know you can't really notice if you
just<00:01:48.090> cut<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.360> spawn<00:01:48.750> between<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.500> know<00:01:49.649> a

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
just cut a spawn between you know a

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.330 
just cut a spawn between you know a
spawn<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.399> depth<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.170> anyway<00:01:52.220> you're<00:01:53.220> going

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
spawn and a depth so anyway you're going

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.069 
spawn and a depth so anyway you're going
to<00:01:53.399> shoot<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.790> watch<00:01:54.360> imaging<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.869> over

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
to shoot that watch imaging it over

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.410 
to shoot that watch imaging it over

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:25.030 
and go over here with the Mongoose and

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:26.790 
and go over here with the Mongoose and
get<00:05:25.450> out<00:05:25.630> from<00:05:25.930> underneath<00:05:26.169> the<00:05:26.410> little<00:05:26.620> wall

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.600 
deal and then you're going to have to do

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.640 
deal and then you're going to have to do
a<00:05:28.630> kamikaze<00:05:29.260> superfly<00:05:30.100> bounce<00:05:30.460> of<00:05:30.700> death<00:05:30.940> and

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
a kamikaze superfly bounce of death and

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.490 
a kamikaze superfly bounce of death and
jump<00:05:32.650> off<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:32.979> Mongoose<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:34.260> basically<00:05:35.260> if

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
jump off the Mongoose and basically if

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.260 
jump off the Mongoose and basically if
you<00:05:35.620> had<00:05:35.740> just<00:05:35.770> jumped<00:05:36.130> off<00:05:36.370> the<00:05:36.430> fall<00:05:36.850> damage

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
you had just jumped off the fall damage

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.779 
you had just jumped off the fall damage
would<00:05:37.510> have<00:05:37.630> been<00:05:37.890> from<00:05:38.890> that<00:05:39.100> entire<00:05:39.430> fall

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
would have been from that entire fall

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:41.340 
would have been from that entire fall
height<00:05:40.060> but<00:05:40.360> because<00:05:40.660> you<00:05:40.780> jump<00:05:41.050> off<00:05:41.200> the

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:41.350 
height but because you jump off the

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:42.719 
height but because you jump off the
Mongoose<00:05:41.740> right<00:05:41.919> there<00:05:42.100> that<00:05:42.280> your<00:05:42.460> fall

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 
Mongoose right there that your fall

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:44.610 
Mongoose right there that your fall
damage<00:05:43.120> was<00:05:43.270> only<00:05:43.479> calculated<00:05:43.930> off<00:05:44.169> of<00:05:44.410> the

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
damage was only calculated off of the

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.010 
damage was only calculated off of the
what's<00:05:45.550> from<00:05:45.669> a<00:05:45.700> call<00:05:45.880> up<00:05:46.000> there<00:05:46.150> and<00:05:46.660> I<00:05:46.870> went

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
what's from a call up there and I went

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.180 
what's from a call up there and I went
super<00:05:47.260> fast<00:05:47.440> mode<00:05:47.680> right<00:05:47.770> there<00:05:47.950> because<00:05:48.039> I

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
super fast mode right there because I

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.029 
super fast mode right there because I
thought<00:05:48.400> he<00:05:48.930> he<00:05:49.930> kept<00:05:50.289> flying<00:05:50.530> a<00:05:50.710> little<00:05:50.890> bit

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 
thought he he kept flying a little bit

00:05:51.039 --> 00:05:52.620 
thought he he kept flying a little bit
and<00:05:51.220> then<00:05:51.640> I<00:05:51.669> just<00:05:51.910> paused<00:05:52.120> it<00:05:52.360> right<00:05:52.479> before

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 
and then I just paused it right before

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:55.560 
and then I just paused it right before
he<00:05:52.990> he<00:05:53.770> shot<00:05:54.070> or<00:05:54.430> made<00:05:54.729> it<00:05:54.850> go<00:05:54.940> normal<00:05:55.360> again

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
he he shot or made it go normal again

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.820 
he he shot or made it go normal again
for<00:05:55.900> a<00:05:55.930> shot<00:05:56.169> because<00:05:56.289> I<00:05:56.440> thought<00:05:56.590> it<00:05:56.740> was

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
for a shot because I thought it was

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.350 
for a shot because I thought it was
going<00:05:56.979> to<00:05:57.039> be<00:05:57.160> a<00:05:57.190> lot<00:05:57.520> further<00:05:57.700> at<00:05:58.030> that<00:05:58.180> I

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
didn't know who's going to shoot it so

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.080

so fast and then I explained it and it

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:10.440 
so fast and then I explained it and it
was<00:06:08.830> over<00:06:09.130> by<00:06:09.280> the<00:06:09.310> time<00:06:09.460> you<00:06:09.729> thought<00:06:09.910> that<00:06:10.120> so

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
was over by the time you thought that so

was over by the time you thought that so
um<00:06:12.000> now<00:06:13.000> what<00:06:13.720> you're<00:06:13.870> going<00:06:13.990> to<00:06:14.080> do<00:06:14.229> is<00:06:14.289> get

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
um now what you're going to do is get

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.830 
um now what you're going to do is get
that<00:06:14.740> jetpack<00:06:14.979> again<00:06:15.430> he<00:06:16.240> did<00:06:16.419> kill<00:06:16.660> himself

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:16.840 
that jetpack again he did kill himself

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.990 
that jetpack again he did kill himself
to<00:06:17.169> show<00:06:17.320> that<00:06:17.470> he<00:06:17.650> can<00:06:17.830> get<00:06:17.950> back<00:06:18.130> there<00:06:18.430> but

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:19.000 
to show that he can get back there but

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.850 
to show that he can get back there but
again<00:06:19.630> I<00:06:19.660> did<00:06:19.960> the<00:06:20.080> whole<00:06:20.229> spawn<00:06:20.530> thing

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
again I did the whole spawn thing

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.170 
again I did the whole spawn thing
because<00:06:21.070> it<00:06:21.100> kind<00:06:21.310> of<00:06:21.370> backfired<00:06:21.789> on<00:06:21.910> them<00:06:21.970> and

00:06:22.170 --> 00:06:22.180 
because it kind of backfired on them and

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.150 
because it kind of backfired on them and
again<00:06:22.720> it<00:06:22.870> backfired<00:06:23.289> on<00:06:23.470> him<00:06:23.590> because<00:06:23.770> this

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 
again it backfired on him because this

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:25.980 
again it backfired on him because this
bond<00:06:24.400> thing<00:06:24.669> didn't<00:06:25.090> work<00:06:25.150> or<00:06:25.510> his<00:06:25.750> spawn

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
bond thing didn't work or his spawn

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.020 
bond thing didn't work or his spawn
thing<00:06:26.200> is<00:06:26.320> a<00:06:26.350> salt<00:06:26.860> thing<00:06:27.039> so<00:06:27.310> I<00:06:27.490> think<00:06:27.729> that's

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:28.030 
thing is a salt thing so I think that's

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.510 
thing is a salt thing so I think that's
fixed<00:06:28.450> in<00:06:28.600> the<00:06:28.690> real<00:06:29.410> map<00:06:29.620> so<00:06:29.979> be<00:06:30.370> sure<00:06:30.430> to

00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 
fixed in the real map so be sure to
