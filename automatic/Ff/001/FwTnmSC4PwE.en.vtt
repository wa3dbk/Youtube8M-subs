00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 the gains from sales samsung advice to 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.359
 down fast 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.820
 Of course the question is what action looks like 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.530
 why is that and how will it be in the future 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.889
 continue to have fun with this video 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.889
 comment 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.400
 Welcome to this new 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.560
 videos from and to this incredible 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.710
 exciting video commentary on the topic 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.100
 samsung and why samsung's future 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.090
 not necessarily so rosy looks 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.620
 probably all heard 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.390
 from this big the biggest one 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:39.920
 disappointment in the last year it samsung 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.379
 announced their new numbers 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.559
 and the profit and the sales extremely 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.180
 broken in and specially from the samsung im 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.710
 smartphone market very strong 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.690
 broken down is thus rather weak 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.100
 has become and now looked at unterm 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.979
 what will happen in the fourth quarter 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.989
 So in the last Christmas quarter and 

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:59.030
 Although not so far is so far 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.710
 gone down but especially good 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.500
 Nevertheless, I look for the profits 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.540
 have dropped by 37 percent and are lying 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.250
 now at $ 47 billion 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.259
 therefore spontaneously, probably always 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.170
 less at 37 percent 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:14.390
 unbelievable amount are around me a feeling 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.520
 it is still around to give that 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.880
 some more or more in any case 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.030
 as google but even less than 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.159
 Microsoft and significantly less than Apple 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.860
 and if you compare that with yet 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:31.180
 values ​​from recent years where samsung 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.480
 times book values ​​of 8 billion dollars 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.810
 profit 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.000
 that was far more than apple too 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.250
 this time then is such a 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.500
 development but drastically and she 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:45.140
 go on it is a spiral piece 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.810
 for piece turns down and yes 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.490
 in short, stock market because there too 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.900
 why have it surfaced? 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.370
 Act not passed the down 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.140
 just because the analysts 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.640
 still much worse result 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.680
 have expected and how to chisel it 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.360
 Exchange is not so bad if something is wrong 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.640
 is as expected, the stock price 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.190
 despite looking up she says 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.259
 exactly who has a look 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.629
 on what it actually holds 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.299
 what is the big problem 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.280
 Business of Samsung smartphones both 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.140
 problem business probably not 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.909
 the right word is actually 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.680
 This was the unbelievable market called 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.359
 strong market for samsung around 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.519
 was there for this basis of samsung 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.109
 so strong could their profit 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.849
 could expand so strong 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:32.370
 and if this market is clear 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:34.650
 weakens and sells less equipment 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.450
 will then clearly sink the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.909
 profits of the whole company is whole 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:41.549
 logical and an important factor 

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.530
 this whole problematic is also that 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.349
 the profit margins are very, very, very 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.209
 are low compared to apple, for example 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.760
 again a feeling for you and a 

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:53.969
 example to give then different 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.730
 bills Apple has winners of up to 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:59.310
 50 at each iphones sold first 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.620
 Profit margin is about 50 percent 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.799
 for example, someone buys an iphone for 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.269
 eight euros will go directly to around 400 euros 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.250
 apple the app can win 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.439
 It is only possible to write to samsung 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.629
 a ninth and a ninth of the 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.609
 small town if then again 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.370
 someone a smartphone for eight euros 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.650
 buys that is less than 100 euros the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.739
 special class gets along because in the end 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:24.810
 samsung sells more smartphones than 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.000
 Apple still because of that 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.159
 The profits are so low 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.780
 end up less profit out there and there 

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:32.879
 just does not count how much 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.040
 you sell mass but also for 

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:37.799
 which price or profit margin 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.959
 We're behind it 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.280
 look to the future how could it be with 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.409
 samsung continue now 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.299
 especially if we are rather less 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:47.609
 Samsung does not have to be the seller 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.319
 has and apparently more devices 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:52.500
 sold as an apple 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:54.840
 and it's worth mentioning that it's samsung 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:57.090
 fundamentally not that bad 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.540
 They are since their profit from this 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.129
 extremely high level was probably times 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.049
 but really financial 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.659
 It will take some time to get problems 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.459
 and some areas of samsung function 

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:11.310
 still very good as for example the 

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.049
 memory or even the tv and we 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:15.610
 can still their still some of 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.100
 Samsung expect in the range of 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.290
 smart watches new smartphones free 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.230
 even glass there are still some 

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:27.070
 The question nevertheless arises 

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:28.750
 samsung can really do that turnaround 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.460
 So even create completely once 

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.500
 if we turn upside down again 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.570
 structure and completely new paths 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.340
 to beat and maybe again 

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.500
 to come back to this old level 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.680
 and maybe again companies like 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.260
 microsoft or apple hard on profit 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.060
 to compete 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.980
 and there are different opinions 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.780
 but very briefly to my opinion I 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:51.130
 I can hardly imagine 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.210
 and that's not just me with the 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.890
 are also different others 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.060
 editors of very different 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.750
 magazines 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.669
 For you I want to introduce the following 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.169
 It has happened more often then you have to 

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:03.580
 you just look the past 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:06.520
 but also a smartphones business 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.320
 computer business there is a high 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.150
 or mostly if somebody times 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.370
 set to music because of the decisions or 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.800
 go wrong, some things once he comes 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:17.020
 mostly, almost not back anymore 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.660
 and that will probably be the one 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.890
 his case for samsung because the would 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.200
 I fully imagine that times a 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:24.880
 Development of a smartphone is yes 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.770
 Apple also takes many many years to complete 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.930
 even if you only have two years for that 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:31.479
 need development if they are only now 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.890
 realize that something is going wrong it takes 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.560
 just too long until you see it 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.990
 can react and really good new ones 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.940
 ideas in smartphones can build around 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.760
 but really these market shares or the 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:45.100
 restore sales 

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:47.020
 this is also that samsung 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.910
 just looking for the right market 

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:52.300
 or not in any right in it 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:54.460
 while apple likes these expensive ones 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:56.560
 luxury market completely occupied and who 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.000
 has a lot of money and not necessarily on 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.580
 the assistance of the buys to be 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.860
 looking for iphone in most cases 

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.840
 Just keep your area up to date 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:08.290
 in middle class was there too 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:09.850
 strong competition from other companies htc 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.510
 we also have a lot of google 

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.390
 China 

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:15.850
 they just compete a lot 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.440
 create and that does not make samsung 

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.340
 certainly lighter but also much 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.440
 much more difficult 

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.449
 that means we will see clearly but so 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:24.790
 as developed but currently say 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:26.290
 a lot of forecast ahead of it's collection 

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.810
 Definitely the next one two 

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:29.320
 years does not create the course strongly 

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.970
 to change 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.310
 you can only hope that samsung 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.440
 can stabilize your profit in half 

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.389
 and still further and 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.860
 can survive 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:41.050
 the basic time for this comment 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:43.479
 I am clearly incredible now 

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.070
