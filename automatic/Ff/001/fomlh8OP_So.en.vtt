00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.640 

um<00:04:24.570> I<00:04:25.050> think<00:04:26.540> you<00:04:27.540> see<00:04:27.720> where<00:04:27.960> we've<00:04:28.410> been

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
um I think you see where we've been

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.800 
um I think you see where we've been
doing<00:04:28.860> the<00:04:28.950> show<00:04:29.160> for<00:04:29.580> 12<00:04:29.910> years<00:04:30.090> now<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.690> was

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
doing the show for 12 years now it was

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.270 
doing the show for 12 years now it was
the<00:04:30.900> first<00:04:30.930> time<00:04:31.230> we<00:04:31.410> crossed<00:04:31.590> the<00:04:31.800> Atlantic

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
the first time we crossed the Atlantic

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.160 
the first time we crossed the Atlantic
so<00:04:32.640> I<00:04:32.670> think<00:04:32.940> the<00:04:33.420> folks<00:04:33.660> how<00:04:33.810> do<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:34.020> have

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:34.170 
so I think the folks how do you have

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:36.710 
so I think the folks how do you have
been<00:04:34.290> waiting<00:04:34.800> patiently<00:04:34.850> it's<00:04:35.850> like<00:04:36.090> a<00:04:36.330> bid

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
been waiting patiently it's like a bid

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.570 
been waiting patiently it's like a bid
for<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.020> Olympics<00:04:37.440> or<00:04:37.560> the<00:04:37.800> fifa<00:04:38.130> world<00:04:38.310> cup

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
for the Olympics or the fifa world cup

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.140 
for the Olympics or the fifa world cup
and<00:04:38.870> now<00:04:39.870> that<00:04:40.110> we<00:04:40.680> are<00:04:40.800> here<00:04:41.100> and<00:04:41.550> we<00:04:41.610> realized

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
and now that we are here and we realized

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.330 
and now that we are here and we realized
that<00:04:42.390> this<00:04:42.540> is<00:04:42.720> how<00:04:43.290> much<00:04:43.440> they<00:04:43.650> were<00:04:44.100> really

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
that this is how much they were really

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:45.770 
that this is how much they were really
wanted<00:04:44.730> it<00:04:44.790> how<00:04:44.940> much<00:04:45.060> they<00:04:45.240> really<00:04:45.360> loved<00:04:45.630> us

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
wanted it how much they really loved us

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.510 
wanted it how much they really loved us
the<00:04:46.170> expectation<00:04:46.770> is<00:04:46.800> that<00:04:46.860> much<00:04:47.100> higher<00:04:47.310> so

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 
the expectation is that much higher so

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.280 
the expectation is that much higher so
we<00:04:47.610> better<00:04:47.760> perform<00:04:48.180> very<00:04:48.360> well<00:04:48.450> and<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:48.870> know

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
we better perform very well and you know

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.140 
we better perform very well and you know
fulfill<00:04:49.890> that<00:04:49.920> expectation<00:04:50.670> because<00:04:50.820> that's

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
fulfill that expectation because that's

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.020 
fulfill that expectation because that's
a<00:04:51.210> promise<00:04:51.540> that<00:04:51.750> we<00:04:52.170> got<00:04:52.320> to<00:04:52.410> keep<00:04:52.530> and<00:04:53.190> why

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
a promise that we got to keep and why

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.450 
a promise that we got to keep and why
did<00:04:54.180> you<00:04:54.300> choose<00:04:55.080> to<00:04:55.140> run<00:04:55.440> over<00:04:55.680> all<00:04:56.160> the<00:04:56.310> other

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:56.460 
did you choose to run over all the other

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.910 
did you choose to run over all the other
cities<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.300> countries<00:04:57.690> I<00:04:57.810> think<00:04:58.200> the<00:04:58.410> the<00:04:58.620> the

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
cities and countries I think the the the

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.480 
cities and countries I think the the the
the<00:04:59.150> government<00:05:00.150> came<00:05:00.690> forward<00:05:01.200> and<00:05:01.380> was<00:05:02.310> very

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
the government came forward and was very

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.520 
the government came forward and was very
very<00:05:02.760> supportive<00:05:02.940> and<00:05:03.540> I<00:05:03.750> think<00:05:04.050> you<00:05:04.110> cannot

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:04.530 
very supportive and I think you cannot

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:05.660 
very supportive and I think you cannot
do<00:05:04.710> something<00:05:04.920> like<00:05:05.190> this<00:05:05.310> without<00:05:05.460> the

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
do something like this without the

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.460 
do something like this without the
support<00:05:05.940> of<00:05:06.060> a<00:05:06.150> government<00:05:06.300> because<00:05:07.050> I<00:05:07.080> don't

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
support of a government because I don't

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:08.510 
support of a government because I don't
think<00:05:07.650> that<00:05:07.740> we<00:05:07.830> just<00:05:07.860> come<00:05:08.190> here<00:05:08.280> for<00:05:08.460> one

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
think that we just come here for one

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.550 
think that we just come here for one
single<00:05:08.790> shown<00:05:09.120> and<00:05:09.300> a<00:05:09.360> watch-night<00:05:09.750> it

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
single shown and a watch-night it

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.840 
single shown and a watch-night it
doesn't<00:05:10.890> end<00:05:11.070> there<00:05:11.190> because<00:05:11.340> there's<00:05:11.730> a<00:05:11.820> lot

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:11.850 
doesn't end there because there's a lot

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.930 
doesn't end there because there's a lot
more<00:05:12.440> that<00:05:13.440> happens<00:05:13.800> bilaterally<00:05:14.460> there's<00:05:14.880> a

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
more that happens bilaterally there's a

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.550 
more that happens bilaterally there's a
lot<00:05:15.090> more<00:05:15.120> that<00:05:15.419> happens<00:05:15.690> trade<00:05:15.990> wise<00:05:16.260> there's

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
lot more that happens trade wise there's

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.500 
lot more that happens trade wise there's
a<00:05:16.620> lot<00:05:16.770> more<00:05:16.800> that<00:05:17.040> happens<00:05:17.310> tourism<00:05:18.000> wise<00:05:18.210> and

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510 
a lot more that happens tourism wise and

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.840 
a lot more that happens tourism wise and
I<00:05:18.810> think<00:05:19.020> people<00:05:19.680> understand<00:05:20.430> that<00:05:20.640> because

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
I think people understand that because

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.050 
I think people understand that because
it's<00:05:21.060> not<00:05:21.120> just<00:05:21.360> about<00:05:21.780> films<00:05:22.820> it's<00:05:23.820> about<00:05:24.030> a

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
it's not just about films it's about a

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.450 
it's not just about films it's about a
lot<00:05:24.270> more<00:05:24.330> and<00:05:24.960> and<00:05:25.560> I<00:05:25.650> think<00:05:25.680> governments

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
lot more and and I think governments

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.480
