nearly exact same just with wild card on
it<00:02:33.140> and<00:02:33.460> actually<00:02:34.900> if<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.470> more<00:02:36.680> into<00:02:36.950> like<00:02:37.130> I

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
it and actually if you more into like I

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.360 
it and actually if you more into like I
don't<00:02:39.080> know<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.410> later<00:02:39.620> side<00:02:39.860> don't<00:02:40.070> really

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
don't know the later side don't really

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.550 
don't know the later side don't really
do<00:02:40.550> any<00:02:40.790> good<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.360> obviously<00:02:42.200> just<00:02:42.380> gives

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
do any good to it obviously just gives

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.330 
do any good to it obviously just gives
it<00:02:42.680> like<00:02:43.240> my<00:02:44.240> requisite<00:02:44.750> but<00:02:44.870> that<00:02:44.990> deep<00:02:45.340> that

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
it like my requisite but that deep that

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.080 
it like my requisite but that deep that
ballistics<00:02:46.910> cpu<00:02:47.560> did<00:02:48.700> already<00:02:49.700> put<00:02:49.940> some

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
ballistics cpu did already put some

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.940 
ballistics cpu did already put some
stuff<00:02:50.240> on<00:02:50.360> it<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:51.110> you<00:02:51.140> can<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.530> can<00:02:51.770> really

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
stuff on it so you can you can really

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.830 
stuff on it so you can you can really
choose<00:02:52.220> between<00:02:52.640> the<00:02:52.820> extended<00:02:53.270> mag<00:02:53.480> depends

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
choose between the extended mag depends

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.190 
choose between the extended mag depends
how<00:02:54.610> much<00:02:55.610> you<00:02:55.790> do<00:02:55.910> it<00:02:56.060> extended<00:02:56.720> mags<00:02:56.870> a<00:02:56.990> laser

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
how much you do it extended mags a laser

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.380 
how much you do it extended mags a laser
sight<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.680> did<00:02:58.400> it<00:02:58.520> a<00:02:58.580> bit<00:02:58.850> with<00:02:59.090> the<00:02:59.209> night

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
sight I did it a bit with the night

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.900 
sight I did it a bit with the night
vision<00:02:59.420> but<00:02:59.870> it<00:02:59.990> wasn't<00:03:00.350> very<00:03:00.650> good<00:03:00.910> what's

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
vision but it wasn't very good what's

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.330 
vision but it wasn't very good what's
kinda<00:03:02.180> odd<00:03:02.360> I<00:03:02.680> didn't<00:03:03.680> do<00:03:03.740> the<00:03:03.890> iron<00:03:04.160> sights

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
kinda odd I didn't do the iron sights

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.270 
kinda odd I didn't do the iron sights
because<00:03:04.670> it's<00:03:04.880> I<00:03:05.590> just<00:03:06.590> didn't<00:03:06.890> do<00:03:06.950> it<00:03:06.980> cuz<00:03:07.220> I'm

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
because it's I just didn't do it cuz I'm

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.810 
because it's I just didn't do it cuz I'm
crap<00:03:07.580> of<00:03:07.760> that<00:03:08.350> so<00:03:09.350> it<00:03:10.070> can<00:03:10.280> mitch<00:03:10.490> a<00:03:10.640> match

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:10.820 
crap of that so it can mitch a match

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.940 
crap of that so it can mitch a match
between<00:03:11.000> like<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.780> extended<00:03:12.290> mags<00:03:12.500> the

comebacks on so they go guys this is in
my<00:04:05.959> thoughts<00:04:06.260> the<00:04:06.950> best<00:04:08.650> set<00:04:09.650> of<00:04:11.590> classes<00:04:12.590> you

00:04:12.759 --> 00:04:12.769 
my thoughts the best set of classes you

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.680 
my thoughts the best set of classes you
can<00:04:12.890> add<00:04:13.040> for<00:04:13.310> the<00:04:13.340> blister<00:04:13.700> I<00:04:13.880> think<00:04:14.480> you<00:04:14.540> see

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:14.690 
can add for the blister I think you see

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:17.920 
can add for the blister I think you see
the<00:04:14.840> dirt<00:04:15.049> change<00:04:15.470> much<00:04:15.890> just<00:04:16.820> one<00:04:17.330> gets<00:04:17.690> a

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:17.930 
the dirt change much just one gets a

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:22.270 
the dirt change much just one gets a
wild<00:04:18.169> card<00:04:18.440> on<00:04:18.680> and<00:04:19.690> the<00:04:20.690> other<00:04:20.959> site<00:04:21.200> in<00:04:21.440> no

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
wild card on and the other site in no

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.710 
wild card on and the other site in no
tacticals<00:04:22.849> and<00:04:23.090> the<00:04:23.180> other<00:04:23.360> one<00:04:23.479> has

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720 
tacticals and the other one has

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.900 
tacticals and the other one has
tacticals<00:04:24.260> so<00:04:25.190> you<00:04:25.280> can<00:04:25.490> make<00:04:25.610> you<00:04:25.760> much

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
tacticals so you can make you much

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.680 
tacticals so you can make you much
between<00:04:26.180> them<00:04:26.419> if<00:04:26.539> you

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
between them if you

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.210 
between them if you
