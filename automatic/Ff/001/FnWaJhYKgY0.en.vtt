00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.260 

see<00:02:09.649> they<00:02:10.009> would<00:02:10.160> not<00:02:10.369> be<00:02:10.580> possible<00:02:10.819> because

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
see they would not be possible because

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.449 
see they would not be possible because
the<00:02:11.420> professor<00:02:12.050> dome<00:02:12.349> she<00:02:12.920> wouldn't<00:02:13.160> be<00:02:13.220> able

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
the professor dome she wouldn't be able

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.620 
the professor dome she wouldn't be able
to<00:02:14.410> smell<00:02:15.410> that<00:02:15.680> at<00:02:15.830> all<00:02:16.209> especially<00:02:17.209> because

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
to smell that at all especially because

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.720 
to smell that at all especially because
I<00:02:17.930> think<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.500> other<00:02:18.800> smell<00:02:19.190> would<00:02:19.400> be<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.520> lot

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
I think the other smell would be a lot

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.030 
I think the other smell would be a lot
worse<00:02:20.060> than<00:02:20.300> that<00:02:20.510> other<00:02:20.900> than<00:02:20.989> screws<00:02:21.650> for

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
worse than that other than screws for

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.569 
worse than that other than screws for
but<00:02:22.310> either<00:02:22.519> way<00:02:22.849> a<00:02:23.560> mistake<00:02:24.560> and<00:02:25.300> that's<00:02:26.300> it
