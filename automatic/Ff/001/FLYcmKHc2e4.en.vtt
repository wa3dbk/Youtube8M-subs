00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
with the very high accuracy and then we

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.150 
with the very high accuracy and then we
got<00:00:43.800> the<00:00:44.010> sort<00:00:44.219> of<00:00:44.370> unexpected<00:00:44.640> result<00:00:46.160> let's

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
got the sort of unexpected result let's

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.310 
got the sort of unexpected result let's
say<00:00:47.340> an<00:00:48.149> understatement<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.170> an

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
say an understatement this was an

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.290 
say an understatement this was an
unexpected<00:00:49.649> result<00:00:51.199> now<00:00:52.199> what<00:00:52.440> we<00:00:53.210> will<00:00:54.210> look

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
unexpected result now what we will look

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.439 
unexpected result now what we will look
forward<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.140> whoever<00:00:56.239> confirmation<00:00:57.239> from

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
this is our our next goal now right but

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.570 
this is our our next goal now right but
if<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.869> come<00:01:07.200> up<00:01:07.380> with<00:01:07.560> those<00:01:07.680> results<00:01:08.340> given

among the best facilities there are

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.140 
among the best facilities there are
available<00:01:13.110> what<00:01:13.650> chance<00:01:13.920> anyone<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.520> really

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
available what chance anyone can really

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.280 
available what chance anyone can really
prove<00:01:15.780> or<00:01:15.960> disprove<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:17.090> well<00:01:18.090> first<00:01:18.990> of<00:01:19.170> all

this<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> sort<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.250> standard<00:01:21.240> procedure

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
this is a sort of standard procedure

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.130 
this is a sort of standard procedure
whenever<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.799> get<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.220> science<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:24.140> result

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
whenever you get in science a result

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.770 
whenever you get in science a result
which<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.650> potentially<00:01:26.430> very<00:01:26.460> large<00:01:27.150> impacts

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
which is potentially very large impacts

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.810 
which is potentially very large impacts
as<00:01:27.930> as<00:01:28.560> our<00:01:28.850> we<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:30.869> is<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.650> mandatory<00:01:32.100> that

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
as as our we it is it is mandatory that

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.359 
as as our we it is it is mandatory that
this<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.540> scrutinized<00:01:34.439> by<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.860> world

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
this is scrutinized by the world

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.120 
this is scrutinized by the world
community<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:36.090> by<00:01:36.960> independent<00:01:37.770> measure<00:01:37.920> and

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
community and by independent measure and

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.840 
community and by independent measure and
as<00:01:38.220> I<00:01:38.340> say<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.549> think<00:01:38.759> there<00:01:39.150> are<00:01:39.180> chances<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.979> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
as I say I think there are chances to to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.160 
as I say I think there are chances to to
study<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.570> same<00:01:42.840> effect<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:44.100> measured

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
study the same effect that we measured

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.830 
study the same effect that we measured
in<00:01:46.170> other<00:01:46.500> places<00:01:46.770> right<00:01:47.460> way<00:01:47.670> Japan<00:01:48.420> yeah

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
in other places right way Japan yeah

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.469 
in other places right way Japan yeah
your<00:01:49.140> test<00:01:49.729> seems<00:01:50.729> you're<00:01:50.939> shown<00:01:51.149> time<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
your test seems you're shown time and

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.310 
your test seems you're shown time and
time<00:01:51.750> and<00:01:51.960> time<00:01:52.170> again<00:01:52.350> that<00:01:53.060> the<00:01:54.060> these<00:01:54.780> sub

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
time and time again that the these sub

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.459 
time and time again that the these sub
particles<00:01:55.770> do<00:01:55.950> go<00:01:56.130> faster<00:01:56.820> if<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.990> is<00:01:58.229> the

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
particles do go faster if that is the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.539 
particles do go faster if that is the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549

would<00:02:03.090> prefer<00:02:03.450> not<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.750> elaborate<00:02:04.350> on<00:02:04.409> that

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
I'm sure that there are many many
