00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 home this video lessons and teach you to 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:08.250
 to install a light bulb 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:12.990
 conventional 20 watt or 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.400
 of 15 watts in a source of two flights in the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.250
 if I'm here using a 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.810
 12-volt battery but this one is 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.720
 type of reactor here allows you to 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.269
 use in various types of use is 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.130
 normally the staff x cars in the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.250
 loss of emergency and power system 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.040
 solar wind power system and other 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.690
 applications according to the need 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.630
 so the first one will show that the 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.420
 reactor or transformer inverter each 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.370
 person calls a way to show 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.530
 you the electric diagram of it 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.850
 in the case of that transformer which is 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.399
 specific 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.690
 he has wireless which is what normally 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.180
 everyone has 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.480
 of those black and red you go 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.410
 do the installation is on the power 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.600
 12 volts 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.660
 the red wire on the positive pole wire 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.149
 black at negative point 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.949
 the two blue children in your 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.080
 transformer was from another brand may 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.970
 be of different color sif 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.920
 in case here the two blue sons 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.220
 go to one end of the lamp 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.340
 fluorescent than white wires to another 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.100
 so I'll make that initial connection is 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:23.939
 to make it easier I left here the outlet 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.460
 connected to the sides of the lamp leaving 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.430
 Of course here the name being careful 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.380
 with insulation with appearance because it is 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.560
 just a bench test I 'm doing 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:37.290
 to demonstrate remembering which lamp 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.509
 of this kind they work 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.329
 with a high voltage for those 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.220
 then light up if you have contact with 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.649
 any of these children who are going to 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.220
 You're in danger of a lamp. 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.500
 so it is right that you insulate this thread 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.860
 to leave in no way that they 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.570
 have contact between themselves and their 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.750
 always keep children safe 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:04.920
 isolated here is how I know I am 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.200
 doing and how is a provisional montage 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.300
 to test 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.280
 leave it the way you're not even there but stay 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:15.140
 Of course it has to be isolated. 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:19.269
 so here I am going to get the two wires 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.269
 and deny at one end of the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.250
 the children I'll call here the other 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:43.560
 End is not going to show 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.560
 the camera is unable to get 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:05.599
 I'll try to show blue threads here. 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:22.100
 I called here at the other end of the 

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:30.550
 lamp is the black wire I'm calling here at 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:33.860
 negative battery pole show better 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.989
 and a red string 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:39.790
 I'm going to get here at the positive 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:43.010
 battery and the lamp will light 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:47.959
 so this link is super simple 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:50.900
 there is no mystery and you can and should 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.630
 put a switch for you 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:55.100
 to make everything island there according to the 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:56.600
 need not leaving the circuit 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.180
 always on 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.420
 remembering that the switch in this case 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.940
 specific here you should put 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:07.400
 interrupting the red wire is not for 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.900
 put a switch after the and that 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.510
 already passed through a transformer 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.950
 that it would be wrong for you to put in the 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:14.690
 switch does not work more or less 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.100
 How much doing here is that he is 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.430
 off by turning the switch 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.539
 teenager 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.700
 I 'll show you later that the 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:27.260
 consumption of this type of bulb fifth 11 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.120
 He is very low on flights. 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.300
 for example a battery of these 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.570
 7- amp nobreak you can 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.610
 keep this lamp on for 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:40.130
 approximately five to eight hours 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.070
 depending on the state of charge in your 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.900
 battery is in good condition you 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.460
 have the new battery in charge 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.650
 all right 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.020
 you can use for up to seven eight 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:54.020
 hours in long this cesa 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.360
 then as emergency light bulbs or 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.970
 like a flashlight to fish for 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.639
 something like this kind of circuit here 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:04.520
 will fit in very well then you 

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:08.210
 next video I'll do this measurement 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.160
 of the current in this consul and 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.110
 I'll make a video later, too. 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.350
 well done teaching you how you 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:18.470
 can set its own validity with 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:20.270
 this type of reactor and with the circuit well 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.349
 you 're going to kill me 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.030
 at home 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:25.699
 so if you have any questions about 

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:28.069
 to the operation of this type of circuit 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:29.810
 you can ask for the comments if 

00:05:28.069 --> 00:05:33.229
 Did you like the closed video show? 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.830
 video till'll ask for you is the nail 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:40.330
 in the video is to subscribe to the channel and I 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.330
 Thank you in advance for having this son.
