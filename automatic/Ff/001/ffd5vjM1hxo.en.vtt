converting them all to the same form

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.269 
converting them all to the same form
let's<00:00:19.720> practice<00:00:20.290> with<00:00:20.470> this<00:00:20.650> set<00:00:20.950> of<00:00:21.099> numbers

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:21.279 
let's practice with this set of numbers

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.240 
let's practice with this set of numbers
here<00:00:22.090> we're<00:00:22.899> going<00:00:22.989> to<00:00:23.050> order<00:00:23.349> this<00:00:23.800> set<00:00:24.099> of

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
here we're going to order this set of

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.330 
here we're going to order this set of
numbers<00:00:24.640> from<00:00:25.059> least<00:00:25.419> to<00:00:25.809> greatest<00:00:26.130> so<00:00:27.130> I'm

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
numbers from least to greatest so I'm

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.339 
numbers from least to greatest so I'm
going<00:00:27.579> to<00:00:27.610> start<00:00:27.970> by<00:00:28.509> converting<00:00:28.960> all<00:00:29.290> of

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:29.349 
going to start by converting all of

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.250 
going to start by converting all of
these<00:00:29.950> numbers<00:00:30.399> into<00:00:30.759> decimals<00:00:32.309> one<00:00:33.309> force<00:00:34.260> to

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
these numbers into decimals one force to

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.099 
these numbers into decimals one force to
convert<00:00:35.620> a<00:00:35.649> fraction<00:00:36.460> to<00:00:36.880> a<00:00:36.910> decimal<00:00:37.109> we

00:00:38.099 --> 00:00:38.109 
convert a fraction to a decimal we

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:41.060 
convert a fraction to a decimal we
divide<00:00:38.140> our<00:00:38.620> numerator<00:00:39.219> by<00:00:39.910> our<00:00:40.179> denominator

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
divide our numerator by our denominator

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:51.029 
divide our numerator by our denominator
1<00:00:42.089> divided<00:00:43.089> by<00:00:43.120> 4<00:00:43.329> is<00:00:44.519> 25<00:00:45.690> hundredths<00:00:48.269> 29<00:00:49.269> %<00:00:50.039> to

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
1 divided by 4 is 25 hundredths 29 % to

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:54.419 
1 divided by 4 is 25 hundredths 29 % to
convert<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.640> percent<00:00:51.879> to<00:00:52.629> a<00:00:52.839> decimal<00:00:53.429> divided

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
convert a percent to a decimal divided

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.689 
convert a percent to a decimal divided
by<00:00:54.730> a<00:00:54.760> hundred<00:00:55.089> or<00:00:55.659> simply<00:00:56.469> move<00:00:56.800> the<00:00:57.100> decimal

00:00:57.689 --> 00:00:57.699 
by a hundred or simply move the decimal

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:02.540 
by a hundred or simply move the decimal
two<00:00:58.449> places<00:00:58.480> to<00:00:59.199> the<00:00:59.800> left<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:01.329> that's<00:01:01.390> 29

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
two places to the left so that's 29

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.080 
two places to the left so that's 29
hundredths<00:01:04.290> our<00:01:05.290> next<00:01:05.800> number<00:01:05.979> is<00:01:06.370> already<00:01:06.760> in

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
hundredths our next number is already in

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.790 
hundredths our next number is already in
decimal<00:01:07.630> form<00:01:08.050> so<00:01:08.830> I'll<00:01:08.979> just<00:01:09.220> bring<00:01:09.430> it<00:01:09.700> down

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
decimal form so I'll just bring it down

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:16.140 
decimal form so I'll just bring it down

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
negative 8 tenths the square root of 16

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:24.090 
negative 8 tenths the square root of 16
is<00:01:16.450> 4<00:01:17.460> since<00:01:18.460> 4<00:01:18.970> times<00:01:19.510> 4<00:01:19.960> is<00:01:20.260> 16<00:01:22.740> negative<00:01:23.740> 2

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
is 4 since 4 times 4 is 16 negative 2

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.950 
is 4 since 4 times 4 is 16 negative 2

is<00:01:35.710> 4<00:01:35.920> 4<00:01:36.670> times<00:01:37.570> 2<00:01:37.840> is<00:01:37.870> 8<00:01:38.110> and<00:01:38.950> the<00:01:39.610> opposite<00:01:40.330> of

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:40.540 
is 4 4 times 2 is 8 and the opposite of

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.350 
is 4 4 times 2 is 8 and the opposite of
8<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:41.920> negative<00:01:42.390> 8<00:01:44.820> finally<00:01:45.820> we<00:01:45.970> have<00:01:46.180> the

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
8 is negative 8 finally we have the

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.920 
8 is negative 8 finally we have the
absolute<00:01:46.810> value<00:01:46.960> of<00:01:47.440> negative<00:01:47.680> 5<00:01:48.930> absolute

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
absolute value of negative 5 absolute

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.070 
absolute value of negative 5 absolute
value<00:01:50.320> is<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.530> distance<00:01:51.270> from<00:01:52.270> 0<00:01:52.690> and

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
value is the distance from 0 and

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.500 
value is the distance from 0 and
negative<00:01:54.040> 5<00:01:54.580> is<00:01:55.000> 5<00:01:55.630> places<00:01:56.140> from<00:01:56.710> 0<00:01:57.040> so<00:01:57.510> the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:58.510 
negative 5 is 5 places from 0 so the

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.000 
negative 5 is 5 places from 0 so the
absolute<00:01:58.960> value<00:01:59.080> of<00:01:59.440> negative<00:01:59.710> 5<00:02:00.520> is<00:02:01.000> 5<00:02:02.010> now

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
absolute value of negative 5 is 5 now

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.640 
absolute value of negative 5 is 5 now
that<00:02:03.280> they're<00:02:03.430> all<00:02:03.460> in<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:03.940> same<00:02:04.150> form<00:02:04.540> we<00:02:05.470> can

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
that they're all in the same form we can

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.809 
that they're all in the same form we can
order<00:02:05.950> them<00:02:06.250> from<00:02:06.610> least<00:02:06.970> to<00:02:07.300> greatest<00:02:08.819> we're

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
order them from least to greatest we're

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.520 
order them from least to greatest we're
going<00:02:09.940> to<00:02:10.000> start<00:02:10.330> with<00:02:10.479> our<00:02:10.509> negative<00:02:10.869> numbers

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.530 
going to start with our negative numbers

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.290 
going to start with our negative numbers
since<00:02:12.190> those<00:02:12.400> are<00:02:12.610> smaller<00:02:12.879> than<00:02:13.150> our

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
since those are smaller than our

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.959 
since those are smaller than our
positive<00:02:13.840> numbers<00:02:14.340> remember<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.730> the

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
positive numbers remember that the

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.170 
positive numbers remember that the
larger<00:02:16.659> than

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
larger than

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.559 
larger than
negative<00:02:17.450> the<00:02:18.230> smaller<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.010> number<00:02:19.040> is<00:02:19.569> so

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
negative the smaller the number is so

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.979 
negative the smaller the number is so
negative<00:02:21.230> 8<00:02:21.530> is<00:02:22.420> much<00:02:23.420> a<00:02:23.750> much<00:02:24.349> bigger<00:02:25.129> number

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
negative 8 is much a much bigger number

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.140 
negative 8 is much a much bigger number
4<00:02:26.989> it's<00:02:27.109> a<00:02:27.200> bigger<00:02:27.590> negative<00:02:27.859> therefore<00:02:28.730> it's

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
4 it's a bigger negative therefore it's

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.229 
4 it's a bigger negative therefore it's
a<00:02:29.299> smaller<00:02:29.780> number<00:02:30.040> so<00:02:31.040> negative<00:02:31.579> 8<00:02:31.819> would<00:02:32.180> be

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
a smaller number so negative 8 would be

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.990 
a smaller number so negative 8 would be
our<00:02:32.510> smallest<00:02:32.719> number<00:02:33.939> starting<00:02:34.939> with

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
our smallest number starting with

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.869 
our smallest number starting with
negative<00:02:35.540> 8

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
negative 8

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.520 
negative 8
after<00:02:37.879> negative<00:02:38.359> 8<00:02:38.629> would<00:02:38.959> be<00:02:39.019> our<00:02:39.260> next

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
after negative 8 would be our next

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.720 
after negative 8 would be our next
negative<00:02:40.340> number<00:02:40.760> negative<00:02:41.200> 8<00:02:42.200> tenths<00:02:42.680> and

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.670 

then<00:02:46.730> we<00:02:46.939> move<00:02:47.150> to<00:02:47.389> our<00:02:47.420> positive<00:02:47.930> numbers

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
then we move to our positive numbers

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.920 
then we move to our positive numbers
looking<00:02:49.549> at<00:02:49.669> our<00:02:49.790> positive<00:02:50.060> numbers<00:02:50.689> we're

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
looking at our positive numbers we're

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.929 
looking at our positive numbers we're
going<00:02:51.049> to<00:02:51.109> start<00:02:51.500> by<00:02:51.709> looking<00:02:51.919> at<00:02:52.280> our<00:02:52.459> whole

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:52.939 
going to start by looking at our whole

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:57.220 
going to start by looking at our whole
numbers<00:02:53.419> our<00:02:54.049> whole<00:02:54.409> number<00:02:54.709> values<00:02:55.720> the<00:02:56.720> zero

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
numbers our whole number values the zero

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.039 
numbers our whole number values the zero
is<00:02:57.650> our<00:02:57.859> smallest<00:02:58.250> whole<00:02:58.730> number<00:02:58.760> value<00:02:59.510> which

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
is our smallest whole number value which

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.869 
is our smallest whole number value which
means<00:03:00.260> one<00:03:00.590> of<00:03:00.620> these<00:03:00.950> numbers<00:03:01.430> will<00:03:01.639> come

00:03:01.869 --> 00:03:01.879 
means one of these numbers will come

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:04.659 
means one of these numbers will come
next<00:03:02.169> but<00:03:03.169> if<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.409> look<00:03:03.650> at<00:03:03.799> the<00:03:03.950> tenths<00:03:04.400> place

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:04.669 
next but if you look at the tenths place

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:08.140 
next but if you look at the tenths place
the<00:03:05.419> tenths<00:03:05.930> place<00:03:05.989> is<00:03:06.379> also<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:06.980> same<00:03:07.250> so

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
the tenths place is also the same so

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.059 
the tenths place is also the same so
then<00:03:08.299> we've<00:03:08.419> got<00:03:08.599> to<00:03:08.689> go<00:03:08.840> one<00:03:09.409> place<00:03:09.650> further

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
then we've got to go one place further

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.250 
then we've got to go one place further
and<00:03:10.489> look<00:03:10.939> at<00:03:11.060> the<00:03:11.180> hundredths<00:03:11.659> place

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
and look at the hundredths place

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.369 
and look at the hundredths place
to<00:03:12.590> see<00:03:12.769> net<00:03:13.040> which<00:03:13.340> number<00:03:13.790> would<00:03:13.939> be<00:03:14.000> next<00:03:14.810> so

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
to see net which number would be next so

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:17.500 
to see net which number would be next so
this<00:03:15.530> twenty<00:03:15.950> five<00:03:16.129> hundredths<00:03:16.819> the<00:03:16.969> five<00:03:17.209> is

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
this twenty five hundredths the five is

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.379 
this twenty five hundredths the five is
smaller<00:03:17.780> than<00:03:17.989> the<00:03:18.139> nine<00:03:18.349> so<00:03:19.099> 25<00:03:19.760> hundredths

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
smaller than the nine so 25 hundredths

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:22.210 
smaller than the nine so 25 hundredths
would<00:03:20.569> be<00:03:20.689> our<00:03:20.840> next<00:03:21.169> biggest<00:03:21.829> number

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
would be our next biggest number

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.390 
would be our next biggest number
followed<00:03:23.120> by<00:03:23.560> twenty<00:03:24.560> nine<00:03:24.769> hundredths<00:03:25.579> and

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
followed by twenty nine hundredths and

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.640 
followed by twenty nine hundredths and
then<00:03:28.400> we<00:03:28.549> have<00:03:28.760> our<00:03:29.090> other<00:03:29.419> two<00:03:29.810> whole<00:03:29.989> numbers

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:30.650 
then we have our other two whole numbers

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.020 
then we have our other two whole numbers
four<00:03:30.979> and<00:03:31.280> five<00:03:31.639> so<00:03:32.540> four<00:03:32.989> would<00:03:33.439> be<00:03:33.590> next

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
four and five so four would be next

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.020 
four and five so four would be next
followed<00:03:35.030> by<00:03:35.060> five<00:03:36.159> the<00:03:37.159> last<00:03:37.370> thing<00:03:37.729> we<00:03:37.879> need

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:38.030 
followed by five the last thing we need

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:40.809 
followed by five the last thing we need
to<00:03:38.060> do<00:03:38.359> is<00:03:38.720> to<00:03:39.229> put<00:03:39.590> these<00:03:39.739> numbers<00:03:39.979> back<00:03:40.579> in

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:40.819 
to do is to put these numbers back in

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:42.039 
to do is to put these numbers back in
their<00:03:40.939> original<00:03:41.269> form

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049 
their original form

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:44.710 
their original form
so<00:03:42.859> negative<00:03:43.459> eight<00:03:43.699> wasn't<00:03:44.180> the<00:03:44.299> number<00:03:44.419> we

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
so negative eight wasn't the number we

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.469 
so negative eight wasn't the number we
were<00:03:44.870> given<00:03:45.290> that<00:03:46.069> number<00:03:46.310> was<00:03:46.609> negative<00:03:47.180> two

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:47.479 
were given that number was negative two

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:50.080 
were given that number was negative two
cubed<00:03:48.169> so<00:03:48.979> we're<00:03:49.099> going<00:03:49.189> to<00:03:49.280> rewrite<00:03:49.519> it<00:03:49.909> as

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
cubed so we're going to rewrite it as

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.379 
cubed so we're going to rewrite it as
negative<00:03:50.120> two<00:03:50.810> cubed<00:03:51.400> followed<00:03:52.400> by<00:03:52.609> negative

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:53.389 
negative two cubed followed by negative

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:58.530 
negative two cubed followed by negative
eight<00:03:53.569> tenths<00:03:53.870> which<00:03:54.799> is<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.310> original<00:03:55.790> form

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.899 

then<00:03:59.540> we<00:03:59.659> have<00:03:59.840> twenty-five<00:04:00.530> hundredths<00:04:01.310> what

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
then we have twenty-five hundredths what

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:08.830 
then we have twenty-five hundredths what
which<00:04:02.239> was<00:04:02.479> originally<00:04:03.639> one-fourth<00:04:07.840> after

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
which was originally one-fourth after

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.199 
which was originally one-fourth after
that<00:04:09.019> we<00:04:09.229> had<00:04:09.349> twenty<00:04:09.739> nine<00:04:09.919> hundredths<00:04:10.699> which

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:11.209 
that we had twenty nine hundredths which

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:17.460 
that we had twenty nine hundredths which
was<00:04:11.449> originally<00:04:12.669> 29%

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.159 

following<00:04:18.470> that<00:04:18.650> we<00:04:18.919> had<00:04:19.100> four<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:19.930> four<00:04:20.930> was

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
following that we had four and four was

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.500 
following that we had four and four was
originally<00:04:21.919> the<00:04:22.250> square<00:04:22.580> root<00:04:22.790> of<00:04:22.910> 16<00:04:25.510> finally

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
originally the square root of 16 finally

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.280 
originally the square root of 16 finally
we<00:04:26.750> have<00:04:26.960> five<00:04:27.320> and<00:04:27.970> five<00:04:28.970> was<00:04:29.240> originally<00:04:29.930> the

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
we have five and five was originally the

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:35.409 
we have five and five was originally the
absolute<00:04:30.860> value<00:04:31.250> of<00:04:31.280> negative<00:04:31.790> five<00:04:34.360> now<00:04:35.360> we

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:35.419 
absolute value of negative five now we

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:37.689 
absolute value of negative five now we
have<00:04:35.690> ordered<00:04:35.990> our<00:04:36.110> numbers<00:04:36.530> from<00:04:36.919> least<00:04:37.280> to

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
have ordered our numbers from least to

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:47.650 
have ordered our numbers from least to
greatest

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660
