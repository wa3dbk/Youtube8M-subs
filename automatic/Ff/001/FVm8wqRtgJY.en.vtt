00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:05.430
 to keep our content area perfectly in this central area 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:08.920
 organizes the condemnation more very similar images 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.320
 we can group the year in piles 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.360
 in this case we have these photos of the cascade of are 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.210
 pictures her in a relatively small amount of time 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.980
 then read all these images are as you see very similar 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.670
 always when all these images are in the same folder because they do not 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.400
 can be grouped in stack images that are in different folders 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.320
 as I say 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.390
 always when all this image is c5n - athens and that we can group 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.949
 the e pica 

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.370
 For example, we select the first 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.210
 they make capital master and we wish you the optimum 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.670
 as we have we have election to these five 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.409
 the photographed sieracki will be a group 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.100
 7 not several method 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.430
 one of them would be indonesia there ap photo 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.550
 stacking group lempira 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.760
 as we see 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.320
 all the photographs these 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.580
 p these six pictures want 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.910
 against it and have been grouped in this single photo 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.110
 as I can see and I the photos that are inside 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.900
 seven static 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:17.570
 O well 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.700
 giving the square quique as you see the brand the number is heard say that 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.700
 this stack is made up of six images if I give it 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 as a mayor, the six images have just come off 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.740
 is discounted 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.470
 by closing box 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.240
 that we have there of two of these images is 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.689
 stronger than the rest of the images of the content area which I 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:41.689
 is telling you to find that these images 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.400
 they are found to be part of this pile 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.680
 another in the way of against in the series about the same number to which we have it 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.740
 on stage 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.740
 continues to delay 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.090
 how am I going to love to group them too then look here we have both sides of 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.240
 the miniature a two vertical stripes on this right side 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.920
 and yesterday to the left we also have four lines 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.010
 if we are here 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.080
 as we see also the magen in the a-6 images are displayed and if we arrive 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.059
 Unlike 

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:13.589
 I'm contracted 

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:15.859
 another way of 

00:02:15.859 --> 00:02:17.859
 contract 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:23.779
 or expand these images is through the network the keyboard shortcut s follow that 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:27.670
 we see jessie unfold it expands nothing the images 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.259
 if we give it again and it contracts 

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:35.079
 now I'm going to remove this group within say at any time and opod of 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:37.409
 taste 'upal stampede 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.090
 we give the right button 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.290
 ap and landero and in the mec in the contextual menu that I get here 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.480
 I say jail 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.809
 the battery or remove the battery we will eliminate the battery 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:49.569
 with it he eliminated the pile 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:50.460
 percent 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.690
 when I had to select the images I wanted to offer everyone to asse 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.199
 to close them all 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:58.699
 now I have all the selected images 

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:00.119
 I tell him 

00:03:00.119 --> 00:03:01.659
 remove 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.569
 even shovel pillars make the stack 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.949
 as emule theme the images but each one on his own 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:12.040
 that another of the methods we have also for 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.109
 they made an entity 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.880
 with 14 leaves the hand these images we give the done button 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.579
 in stacking I love pair on pillar 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.039
 I was still cut way 

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:27.559
 I'll come back to taste 'a stick to see another method of europe 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.569
 appealing from the strip 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.459
 how the moya has disappeared travel atila 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.139
 if what I want now is 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:38.969
 to make it pillar by means of a shortcut finger of the keyboard by means of the ateca ok 

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:40.819
 control 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:43.819
 in windows oco mando 

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:47.669
 As we both have it again 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.070
 widespread 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.019
 what of the grouping this 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.430
 what can we do more good taking advantage 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.800
 that we already have the images 100 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.189
 there is someone who can stack this 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.470
 we select tÃ©lam and now pressing the n key 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.150
 as we already know, we are going to supervision mode 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.219
 good price 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.619
 and here we have the is imagine is going to have it called tabulator 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:13.040
 disappear it from being and here we can label the 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.310
 As we saw the previous one, the video scoreboard eliminated them 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:18.889
 all operations that already 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.889
 we have learned the previous the video 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.800
 come on let's go also dwells silleda 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.520
 we continue as we were before 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.520
 in the pictures 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:39.009
 plays well siemionow we were to expand again if we do not like the 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:41.629
 image that appears as a header 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:44.629
 we do not know what we want to be is other 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.870
 this is what we want to put as a header, we simply take it 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.680
 dragging and we put it here 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.680
 let's adapt 

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:02.120
 in this case we talk but we could catch 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.949
 and do the same to pillar 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.159
 and yes move to the top of the stack 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:10.080
 and as the mosco there will be the one that we have 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.669
 we pressed that so that we were against the stoning leaf of the bad image that 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:17.870
 we have now as the header of the stack is this 

00:05:18.809 --> 00:05:21.210
 that at any time we can 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.750
 group the week grouped entities divide the stack say all these 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.030
 options we will find here stacking as masters of the balance in the 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:32.020
 pile remove a photo from the pile 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.270
 specifically sing six selected after there is a beauty that we do not like 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:39.810
 we eliminate it from the stack which does not mean we eliminate our level 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.810
 catalog or from our part in detail simply 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.260
 move down the enap and tell this image the jukebox 

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:48.860
 send down 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.699
 and one of the options that I also have to be relatively important especially 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:56.870
 for those people who were dedicated to photography in studio to pillar odom 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.559
 entirely per capture hour 

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:00.490
 that we can network 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:04.580
 generate a template or let's say the whole picture in a time arm 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:05.479
 determined 

00:06:05.479 --> 00:06:09.419
 they automatically squeeze in this way came to greater than the trigger and 

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:10.969
 I put six photos of the 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:11.650
 9 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.180
 those six points ap 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.919
 it automatically crowded 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:19.189
 for it later he can not go they review him two selecting and cataloging 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.660
 it's good to also remember as a video clip assistant 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.030
 all these texts that you already explained these days are 

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.550
 pm a manual 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:32.520
 in pdf format 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.279
