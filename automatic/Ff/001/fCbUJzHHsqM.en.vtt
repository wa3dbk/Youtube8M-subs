00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.840
 Hello my dears 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.879
 today we were a very good self 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:12.070
 make and for that it needed to be only 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.110
 Such yogurt milk yoghurt machine 

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.549
 as well as have always been there I have 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.800
 now ordered from Amazon and has 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.390
 and only for 16 euro cost which 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.820
 I'm always extremely beer brand too sorry 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.230
 drive this Provamel to pick yuko at 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.850
 the alpro soya yoghurt it unfortunately 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.740
 sweetened and I really want that 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.330
 not and that's why I thought so 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.250
 I'll just try that out and 

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.510
 though with you and first 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.249
 you need a soy milk 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.649
 that is then in the case i have the 

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:37.780
 provamel soy milk taken without sugar 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:40.300
 there are really only so inherit and water 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.269
 inside and also accordingly 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.460
 provamel yogurt there is only water 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:49.480
 and soja lived a few stabilizers 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.460
 but no sugar and that starts 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.749
 room temperature so I have 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.729
 just bought in the store was not 

00:00:52.749 --> 00:00:57.309
 cooled and that is again 

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:59.649
 was easy because I'm just biomarkt 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.179
 drive that bought and yes with it 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.629
 we want to work because of it 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.250
 Generally so you need some yogurt 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.020
 you just need the milk very active 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.159
 those in there are yogurt in the end 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.450
 to make himself 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.310
 So we have a big one here 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.939
 container just a stream 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.759
 is connected and this holds everything 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:20.200
 in total to 240 degrees 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:22.840
 and then we have a little inner 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.100
 cups just for the yogurt and there are 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.350
 I also have mass information 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.899
 just rinsed out very hot with it 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.229
 there are no bacteria in it and just one 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.759
 lid and a spoon and yes that 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.619
 It works quite simply we take the 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.329
 soy milk give it in there and add 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.820
 then a few spoon is so yogurt 

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.469
 We can of course also yogurt 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.820
 From that you can buy that way 

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:45.640
 but it is much more expensive 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:47.799
 in organic market, the seven Euro has cost 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.750
 and I do not know if it started 

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.280
 and the internet costs 17 euro 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.450
 and once you 've done well 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.280
 you can always do something about it 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.689
 store or freeze then 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.640
 Can you then start again from 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:00.070
 So take a new youth then 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.869
 let's just start and that 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.270
 give it first because the soy milk 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.460
 to between another experiment 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.179
 started with bread drink because he 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.039
 also lactic acid bacteria in it 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.239
 that did not work out and had there 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.280
 Not even me, these machines 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.230
 I am the first time before I have 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.700
 that tries with such a one 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.769
 Thermo cup could of course times 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.500
 try the whole seven to ten 

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:25.129
 hours to 42 degrees to hold 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.930
 example oven or so but that can 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.430
 I also do not promise but are the 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.859
 machines until now are the 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.019
 Of course, there are also investments 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:42.560
 with small subjects so not only with 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:45.040
 a great deal of this so that 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.959
 now just a little list because 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.250
 as already quite full and then take 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:55.700
 I now about three spoonfuls of that 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.909
 yogurt reporter in there too 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.909
 to get 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:18.590
 earlier all the cautious about yes and 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.890
 then you close the whole course 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:30.560
 yet now I only play once briefly 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:32.150
 spoon off and then we go then go 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:33.830
 We cover the main fact of the 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.560
 vases and then it will be easy 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:38.180
 connected to the stream and 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.310
 made for about seven to ten hours 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.380
 Do not stay tuned if we are something 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.050
 yes relatively loose in it flows because of it 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.420
 It just looks like the strohmann and 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.980
 move this carefully into the other one 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.720
 direction because you can already see it 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.630
 shine and the symbol that is since 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.240
 Now up and holding the yogurt 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.130
 There is one for about seven to ten hours 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.050
 I'll think about it seven times 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.270
 take eight hours and look there 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.140
 after that it is clear that miner on 

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:08.570
 42 degrees and jan are currently spreading 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.910
 stop the lactic acid bacteria yes 

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:13.210
 you have to come from the milk 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:15.560
 to say that maybe not yet know 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.000
 they spread in there and then 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.750
 you would actually have the fresh 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.220
 have yogurt 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.750
 then he comes in the then 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:22.610
 fridge but then we'll see each other 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.140
 later again when that's done 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.610
 and then later I'm off 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:27.470
 frozen yogurt we totally do here 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.970
 I like the weather and yes 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.790
 that we should just try this in 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.540
 rest and let the thing be his 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.390
 do work 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.620
 it is so finished so yes 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:38.780
 at least be ready 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:43.700
 I want this as a first here 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:49.940
 tube out because in the west a high 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:52.270
 Get out of here and you very hard us 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.260
 but look at it 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.480
 I 've just been in for a while 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:01.190
 died to top up meanwhile is firm 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.600
 and you see he is catching that 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.290
 the soja and now comes in first 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.700
 the refrigerator 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.430
 I also read one should rather 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.990
 the plastic parts take instead as with 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.370
 when to enter metal 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.050
 Why is the case? I do not know 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.130
 I write such at the info box and 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.850
 how does that seem to wobble? 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.850
 bit like pudding 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:24.240
 greek does it so well that is warm 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.240
 here comes now with the fridge and 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.960
 See you tomorrow morning 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.790
 if I break the spell 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.580
 so now we are the next morning and 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:34.480
 you see the iodine is stingfast and you 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:35.830
 stuck 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.330
 Rome has a bit of water 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.980
 but the bad can accumulate 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.600
 that pour off or even in there leave ever 

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.800
 how you like it and me 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.510
 Now take a few spoonfuls 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.190
 because I mean that right now 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:47.590
 want to give pancakes with fresh 

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:49.210
 fruits and indeed first just what 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.490
 I suppose that would be possible 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.970
 also in the container issued the 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.100
 well cleaned you have to see how the 

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.750
 consistency is the yogurt- like i 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:01.000
 I also tried times as well as tastes 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.740
 without anything quite as versatile as you 

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.690
 Last processed on super 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.060
 I want it all together again 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:08.230
 With that a nice creamy consistency 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:11.940
 will and then I give something else 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:14.590
 Dicksaft to michell's 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.940
 and something vanilla because it is a sweet 

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.830
 Of course , that should be fair 

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:21.640
 also do as you like with fruits 

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:23.410
 and so and yes, for example, serving suggestion with 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.570
 pancakes and the recipe you see then 

00:06:23.410 --> 00:06:27.160
 next video I have in parallel with 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.840
 turned and now but I wish a lot 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.520
 I hope you had liked that 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:32.500
 and if you liked that, give me 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.280
 but please a thumbs up to the 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.280
 next time shoot
