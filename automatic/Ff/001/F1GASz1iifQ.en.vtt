00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
old and it didn't it doesn't do HD so

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.430 
old and it didn't it doesn't do HD so
I'm<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.669> process<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:33.450> upgrading<00:00:33.660> my<00:00:34.140> Sony

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
I'm in the process of upgrading my Sony

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.740 
I'm in the process of upgrading my Sony
Vegas<00:00:34.649> software<00:00:35.430> to<00:00:36.120> give<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.510> an<00:00:36.630> HD

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
Vegas software to give it an HD

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.350 
Vegas software to give it an HD
capability<00:00:37.649> so<00:00:38.219> what<00:00:38.399> happened<00:00:38.790> was<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.270> now

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
capability so what happened was and now

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.700 
capability so what happened was and now
I<00:00:39.390> may<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.660> wrong<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.440> I'm<00:00:40.530> pretty

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
I may be wrong about this but I'm pretty

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.889 
I may be wrong about this but I'm pretty
sure<00:00:40.800> this<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.160> what<00:00:41.399> happened<00:00:41.730> when<00:00:42.270> I<00:00:42.300> when<00:00:42.870> I

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
sure this is what happened when I when I

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.440 
sure this is what happened when I when I
rendered<00:00:43.320> it<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:43.590> uploaded<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.190> YouTube<00:00:45.059> it

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
rendered it and uploaded to YouTube it

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.540 
rendered it and uploaded to YouTube it
just<00:00:45.719> didn't<00:00:45.989> do<00:00:46.079> an<00:00:46.230> HD<00:00:46.649> so<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.920> degraded<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
just didn't do an HD so it degraded the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:51.110 
just didn't do an HD so it degraded the
value<00:00:48.000> of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.020> video<00:00:49.530> or<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> quality<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.030> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
value of the video or the quality of the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.299 
value of the video or the quality of the
video<00:00:51.329> but<00:00:52.140> one<00:00:52.410> thing<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.680> will<00:00:52.860> say<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.160> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
video but one thing I will say is the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.000 
video but one thing I will say is the
ideal<00:00:53.340> quality<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.360> my<00:00:54.510> opinion<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:55.260> awesome<00:00:55.860> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
ideal quality in my opinion is awesome I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.760 
ideal quality in my opinion is awesome I
think<00:00:56.340> personally<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.030> blows<00:00:57.390> away<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:58.379> flip

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
think personally it blows away the flip

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.260 
think personally it blows away the flip
Mino<00:00:58.949> which<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.430> what<00:00:59.609> I'm<00:00:59.699> using<00:00:59.730> right<00:01:00.239> now

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
Mino which is what I'm using right now

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.650 
Mino which is what I'm using right now

back<00:01:15.710> which<00:01:16.710> is<00:01:16.740> really<00:01:16.890> nice<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.970> is

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
back which is really nice and this is

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.260 
back which is really nice and this is
actually<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> fairly<00:01:18.810> small<00:01:19.229> camera<00:01:20.150> when<00:01:21.150> you

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
actually a fairly small camera when you

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.520 
actually a fairly small camera when you
turn<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.720> on<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:23.400> button<00:01:23.759> on<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.970> top

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
turn it on a little button on the top

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.340 
turn it on a little button on the top
the<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.560> lens<00:01:26.340> comes<00:01:26.700> out<00:01:27.030> which<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.049> really

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
the the lens comes out which is really

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.370 
the the lens comes out which is really
kind<00:01:28.560> of<00:01:28.619> nice<00:01:29.030> and<00:01:30.030> then<00:01:30.750> when<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.020> turn<00:01:31.229> it

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
kind of nice and then when you turn it

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.960 
kind of nice and then when you turn it
off<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:33.229> it<00:01:34.229> contracts<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.579> then<00:01:35.790> there's

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
off it it contracts and then there's

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.719 
off it it contracts and then there's
like<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> protector<00:01:36.869> that<00:01:37.400> protects<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.520> lens

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
like a protector that protects the lens

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.940 
like a protector that protects the lens
which<00:01:38.939> I<00:01:39.090> really<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:40.500> has<00:01:40.619> a<00:01:40.650> pretty

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
which I really like it has a pretty

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.280 
which I really like it has a pretty
decent<00:01:41.159> flash<00:01:41.670> on<00:01:42.030> it<00:01:42.060> flash<00:01:42.540> it's<00:01:42.750> located<00:01:43.110> up

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
decent flash on it flash it's located up

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.520 
decent flash on it flash it's located up
here<00:01:44.299> all-in-all<00:01:45.299> so<00:01:45.659> far<00:01:45.960> seems<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.409> a

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
here all-in-all so far seems like a

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.380 
here all-in-all so far seems like a
pretty<00:01:46.770> decent<00:01:47.040> camera<00:01:47.610> there's<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.090> lot<00:01:48.240> of

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
pretty decent camera there's a lot of

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.139 
pretty decent camera there's a lot of
really<00:01:48.780> upscale<00:01:49.380> features<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:50.009> this<00:01:50.159> for<00:01:51.119> a

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
really upscale features to this for a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.999 
really upscale features to this for a
