00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.269
 of these in water free to the show 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.710
 starch potatoes 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.330
 my technology challenge 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.070
 cda alderman have the scale with technology 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.280
 for 2007 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.280
 it's all from Tuesday 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.830
 so there would all be 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.010
 youth is our third 4 4 3 teacher 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.710
 in the second corner 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.670
 terribly so the second one has 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.670
 sometimes a somewhat reasonable day run newspaper 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 a bit dependent on the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.190
 overview for the machine 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.680
 animals are clearly visible 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.680
 that you can see well on the camera in the 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.190
 fortis earlier 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.870
 preferably 7 0 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.950
 the folder that is available 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.930
 I'll see you coming 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.640
 what do you want 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.269
 can run a good day 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.269
 that is ten hectares easily achievable 

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:15.039
 although I sometimes benefit 7 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:19.109
 so a bit dependent on where 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.109
 the board of directors is full 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:27.849
 both mentally and physically
