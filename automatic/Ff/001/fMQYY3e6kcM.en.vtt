00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 berlin - the wonderful kitchen of jack 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:17.640
 today we have a special guest 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:19.740
 The band is today's brazil. 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.350
 and the spaghetti alla carbonara 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.990
 here we go to spaghetti ingredients 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.810
 hard grain 4 egg yolks and an egg 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.210
 whole peeled extra olive oil 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.360
 virgin black pepper cheese 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.230
 Roman pecorino anchieta and beer 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.030
 Italian 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.440
 some ingredients are difficult to 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.390
 to think that we can make a 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.190
 substitution still of spaghetti grain 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.290
 hard a spaghetti of the hand instead of the 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.480
 Roman pecorino cheese, we can 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.190
 the grated parmesan and not the amount 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.770
 that we use well with the first thing 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.420
 Let's put the spaghetti to cook a 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.399
 pan with boiling water with us already 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.859
 saw in the other video talking about 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.949
 Spaghetti you do not vote for oil in pan 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.439
 and in this other video here it is talking 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.390
 How much water do you have to put in eight? 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.070
 minutes it will already be a tooth 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.799
 the first thing we'll do is 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.369
 cut the amount let's take today and here 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.640
 on the clipboard for this role and let's 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:22.530
 cut into cubes 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.470
 the amount is kind a mega b with bacon 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.630
 gods but in fact he will make a 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.780
 role of another ingredient that is the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.960
 original ingredient that hangs there 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.759
 watch there is simply the bacon made 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.759
 with the cheek of the body only instead 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.600
 smoked as normal or anti- bacon 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.640
 there and the clipboard are cured only 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.390
 steering wheel is very difficult to find out 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.390
 from Italy 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:02:00.159
 and put the olive oil in a frying pan already 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.159
 hot and boot to start fry 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:16.450
 while fried on the drawing board let's put 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.450
 eggs the gems 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.489
 and let's hit it 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.920
 Let's mix pecorino cheese here. 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:37.269
 which may be the parmesan in his place 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.470
 mix and when you're done like this 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:45.190
 mixed 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:45.790
 We play panchita and now that I go 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.400
 do 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:54.610
 noodles ready, I'm going to drip 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:57.970
 but I'm a little water if 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:03:01.750
 play the pasta itself will cook one 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:05.799
 egg to be totally raw to people 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:10.390
 move him to get the pasta sauce 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:13.140
 I'm in the final touch, let's put the pepper 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.140
 of the black kingdom 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.980
 and with the original recipe of spaghetti 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.360
 carbonara from lazio region 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.640
 So let's have some wine for 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.920
 harmonize a wine from the same region 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:30.920
 called frascati is the type of 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:33.040
 wine makes box saw it was served 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.040
 ice cold 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:40.590
 should have put a little less 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.590
 as well as at home 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.500
 It's really hot now if you're one of those 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.640
 which do not dispense with a red wine 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.340
 bronchitis 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.390
 there also falls well with this dish and let's 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:59.110
 stop the most difficult part of the program 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:01.920
 wore lipstick did not try the dish without 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.920
