in you just rock it back and forth the
blade<00:00:48.170> want<00:00:48.830> to<00:00:48.920> go<00:00:49.070> in<00:00:50.230> to<00:00:51.230> the<00:00:51.350> depth<00:00:51.590> that<00:00:51.860> it

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
blade want to go in to the depth that it

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.990 
blade want to go in to the depth that it
can<00:00:53.140> hit<00:00:54.140> up<00:00:54.290> to<00:00:54.320> that<00:00:54.560> Ridge<00:00:54.800> on<00:00:55.220> the<00:00:55.610> tool

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
can hit up to that Ridge on the tool

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.300 
can hit up to that Ridge on the tool
here<00:00:56.570> so<00:00:57.760> goes<00:00:58.760> in<00:00:59.000> no<00:00:59.930> good<00:01:00.890> quarter<00:01:01.190> of<00:01:01.220> an

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:01.310 
here so goes in no good quarter of an

here so goes in no good quarter of an
inch<00:01:01.630> comes<00:01:02.630> out<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:03.380> just<00:01:03.410> push<00:01:04.400> in<00:01:04.579> and

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:07.399 
rock back and forth take some patience

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.700 
rock back and forth take some patience
but<00:01:07.939> your<00:01:08.060> knobs<00:01:08.270> will<00:01:08.810> now<00:01:08.929> have<00:01:11.560> sizing<00:01:12.560> to

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
but your knobs will now have sizing to

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.789 
but your knobs will now have sizing to
them<00:01:12.890> as<00:01:13.819> you<00:01:14.090> can<00:01:14.240> see<00:01:14.450> the<00:01:15.289> psyching

them as you can see the psyching
actually<00:01:16.569> has<00:01:17.569> a<00:01:17.600> lot<00:01:17.869> of<00:01:18.049> edges<00:01:18.289> to<00:01:18.499> it<00:01:19.119> when

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
actually has a lot of edges to it when

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:29.960 
actually has a lot of edges to it when
it<00:01:20.240> actually<00:01:20.420> opens<00:01:20.960> up<00:01:24.909> use<00:01:25.909> another<00:01:27.399> example

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970

well it's good for all around especially

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.530 
well it's good for all around especially
for<00:02:43.440> mud<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:44.340> I<00:02:44.370> don't<00:02:44.610> like<00:02:44.850> about<00:02:45.000> this<00:02:45.270> tire

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
for mud but I don't like about this tire

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.250 
for mud but I don't like about this tire
compared<00:02:46.050> to<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.380> tire<00:02:46.650> and<00:02:47.090> this<00:02:48.090> one<00:02:48.360> to<00:02:49.170> be

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
compared to this tire and this one to be

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.800 
compared to this tire and this one to be
specific<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:51.630> need<00:02:51.840> edges<00:02:52.430> that<00:02:53.690> want<00:02:54.690> to

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
specific is you need edges that want to

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.890 
specific is you need edges that want to
hang<00:02:55.320> up<00:02:55.500> on<00:02:55.680> the<00:02:55.980> edges<00:02:56.250> of<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:57.000> roots<00:02:57.239> for

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
hang up on the edges of the roots for

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.410 
hang up on the edges of the roots for
gonna<00:02:57.989> use<00:02:58.140> as<00:02:58.260> an<00:02:58.380> example<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.910> what<00:03:00.060> happens

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
gonna use as an example and what happens

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.070 
gonna use as an example and what happens
on<00:03:00.600> here<00:03:00.989> is<00:03:01.170> it'll<00:03:01.590> catch<00:03:01.769> an<00:03:01.920> edge<00:03:02.100> and<00:03:03.080> then

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
on here is it'll catch an edge and then

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.620 
on here is it'll catch an edge and then
as<00:03:04.200> it<00:03:04.320> comes<00:03:04.500> down<00:03:04.620> it<00:03:05.519> wants<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.000> sit<00:03:06.209> on<00:03:06.239> top

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:06.630 
as it comes down it wants to sit on top

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.350 
as it comes down it wants to sit on top
of<00:03:06.810> the<00:03:06.930> knob<00:03:07.700> might<00:03:08.700> catch<00:03:08.940> a<00:03:09.000> little<00:03:09.120> bit<00:03:09.300> of

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
of the knob might catch a little bit of

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.850 
of the knob might catch a little bit of
the<00:03:09.450> edge<00:03:10.250> but<00:03:11.250> as<00:03:11.870> it<00:03:12.870> comes<00:03:13.320> around<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.709> root

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
the edge but as it comes around the root

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.370 
the edge but as it comes around the root
hits<00:03:14.130> it<00:03:14.370> tends<00:03:14.970> to<00:03:15.090> want<00:03:15.360> to<00:03:15.570> high<00:03:15.840> center<00:03:16.230> if

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
hits it tends to want to high center if

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.699 
hits it tends to want to high center if
you<00:03:16.410> will<00:03:16.560> up<00:03:17.220> on<00:03:17.400> the<00:03:17.489> next<00:03:17.730> set<00:03:17.880> of<00:03:17.910> knobs<00:03:18.709> so

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
you will up on the next set of knobs so

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:21.680 
you will up on the next set of knobs so
it<00:03:19.769> doesn't<00:03:19.950> have<00:03:20.040> a<00:03:20.100> chance<00:03:20.280> to<00:03:20.730> recess<00:03:21.420> down

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
it doesn't have a chance to recess down

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.140 
it doesn't have a chance to recess down
whereas<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.500> trials<00:03:23.130> tire<00:03:23.310> all<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.030> way

this<00:03:31.470> tire<00:03:31.860> is<00:03:32.160> really<00:03:32.760> stiff<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.650> mean<00:03:34.650> even

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
this tire is really stiff I mean even

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.330 
this tire is really stiff I mean even
with<00:03:35.400> no<00:03:35.610> air<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.090> it<00:03:36.209> it's<00:03:36.660> really<00:03:37.340> it's

with no air in it it's really it's

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.290 
with no air in it it's really it's
really<00:03:38.430> hard<00:03:38.850> to<00:03:39.000> even<00:03:39.150> push<00:03:39.870> down

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
really hard to even push down

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.979 
really hard to even push down
whereas<00:03:42.300> they<00:03:42.450> are<00:03:42.480> see<00:03:43.080> tire<00:03:44.720> even<00:03:45.720> with<00:03:45.810> no

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.470 
air in it it's real pliable you can you
can<00:03:52.010> see<00:03:53.010> how<00:03:53.099> the<00:03:53.160> rubbers<00:03:53.580> softer<00:03:54.060> between

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
can see how the rubbers softer between

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.010 
can see how the rubbers softer between
that<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.870> psyching<00:03:55.319> and<00:03:55.739> particularly

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
just the tread is gonna go this way and

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:05.630 
just the tread is gonna go this way and
between<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.040> knobs<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.489> can<00:04:02.550> see<00:04:03.319> how<00:04:04.640> the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
between the knobs you can see how the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.290 
between the knobs you can see how the
route<00:04:06.319> or<00:04:07.319> a<00:04:07.350> rock<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:08.160> edge<00:04:08.340> kept<00:04:08.760> all<00:04:08.970> these

next<00:04:18.359> set<00:04:18.660> of<00:04:18.780> edges<00:04:19.400> you<00:04:20.400> can<00:04:20.519> get<00:04:20.609> the<00:04:20.729> idea

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
next set of edges you can get the idea

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:24.469 
next set of edges you can get the idea
so<00:04:21.450> all<00:04:22.320> about<00:04:22.560> edges<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:24.060> there's<00:04:24.270> your

00:04:24.469 --> 00:04:24.479 
so all about edges so there's your

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:27.620 
so all about edges so there's your
sighting<00:04:25.610> sample<00:04:26.610> takes<00:04:27.030> a<00:04:27.150> while<00:04:27.330> to<00:04:27.360> do<00:04:27.600> this

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
sighting sample takes a while to do this

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.430 
sighting sample takes a while to do this
is<00:04:28.260> not<00:04:28.530> hard<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.160> honey<00:04:29.580> worth<00:04:29.790> three<00:04:30.030> bucks

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
is not hard so honey worth three bucks
