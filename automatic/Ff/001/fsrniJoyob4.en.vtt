tablespoon of them just add it seats all
mixed<00:01:42.979> or<00:01:43.479> semolina<00:01:44.479> takes<00:01:44.960> a<00:01:45.110> little<00:01:45.700> less<00:01:46.700> or

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 
mixed or semolina takes a little less or

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.520 
mixed or semolina takes a little less or
more<00:01:47.240> water<00:01:48.130> so<00:01:49.130> not<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.729> worry

use it so the mixture Israel do you see

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.040 
use it so the mixture Israel do you see
the<00:02:47.900> consistency<00:02:48.230> here<00:02:49.750> this<00:02:50.750> is<00:02:50.930> the

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
the consistency here this is the

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.130 
the consistency here this is the
consistence<00:02:51.650> okay<00:02:52.640> just<00:02:53.480> remember<00:02:53.690> this

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140

proportion<00:02:58.040> we<00:02:58.670> have<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:59.150> see<00:02:59.990> it<00:03:00.050> right<00:03:00.980> now

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
proportion we have to see it right now

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:05.200 
proportion we have to see it right now

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
sprinkle very little water over it so it

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.700 
sprinkle very little water over it so it
start<00:03:10.310> functioning<00:03:13.660> so<00:03:14.660> it<00:03:14.870> bubbles<00:03:15.470> are

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
start functioning so it bubbles are

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.820 
start functioning so it bubbles are
coming<00:03:15.890> up<00:03:16.190> can<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.210> see<00:03:17.450> the<00:03:17.600> bubbles<00:03:17.930> yeah

coming up can you see the bubbles yeah
now<00:03:19.730> we<00:03:19.790> start<00:03:20.240> mixing<00:03:21.040> one<00:03:22.040> golden<00:03:22.580> rule<00:03:22.790> for

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820
