back<00:00:33.809> at<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.080> old<00:00:34.230> European<00:00:34.379> guitars<00:00:35.129> that

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
back at the old European guitars that

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.070 
back at the old European guitars that
we're<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:35.940> sixth<00:00:36.180> string<00:00:36.330> originally<00:00:36.900> came

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
from and they were played in parlors and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.470 
from and they were played in parlors and
they<00:00:40.260> were<00:00:40.730> really<00:00:41.730> designed<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.239> very

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
they were really designed for very

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.020

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
subtle setting and so cedar was a very

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.380 
subtle setting and so cedar was a very
popular<00:00:48.590> top<00:00:49.590> wood<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.070> they<00:00:50.910> were<00:00:50.969> twelve

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:55.200 
frets to the body and the bridge was in

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.619 
frets to the body and the bridge was in
the<00:00:55.379> center<00:00:55.739> about<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.280> so<00:00:56.969> we<00:00:57.000> said<00:00:57.239> okay<00:00:57.480> how

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
the center about and so we said okay how

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.569 
the center about and so we said okay how
do<00:00:57.690> we<00:00:57.780> get<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.110> articulation<00:00:58.860> but<00:00:59.370> how<00:00:59.520> do

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
do we get that articulation but how do

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.020 
do we get that articulation but how do
we<00:00:59.760> create<00:01:00.030> an<00:01:00.710> American<00:01:01.710> sounding<00:01:02.670> guitar

of<00:01:19.830> Indian<00:01:20.729> rosewood<00:01:23.479> we<00:01:24.479> extended<00:01:25.170> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
of Indian rosewood we extended the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.620 
of Indian rosewood we extended the
bridge<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.799> it<00:01:26.010> crosses<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> braces<00:01:27.030> so

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
bridge so that it crosses the braces so

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.810 
bridge so that it crosses the braces so
the<00:01:27.810> mode<00:01:27.990> lines<00:01:28.229> that<00:01:28.470> go<00:01:28.590> here<00:01:28.979> and<00:01:29.189> here<00:01:29.640> and

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
the mode lines that go here and here and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.020 
the mode lines that go here and here and
here<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.420> normally<00:01:31.100> create<00:01:32.100> some<00:01:32.580> overtones

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
here and normally create some overtones

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.190 
here and normally create some overtones
right<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.570> this<00:01:34.110> one<00:01:34.350> moves<00:01:34.619> more<00:01:36.049> in<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
right here this one moves more in the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.590 
right here this one moves more in the
center<00:01:37.439> so<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:37.799> get<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> bit<00:01:38.340> more<00:01:38.490> power<00:01:38.759> this

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
center so we get a bit more power this

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.870 
center so we get a bit more power this
particular<00:01:40.350> cedar<00:01:40.799> was<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.100> log<00:01:41.430> that<00:01:41.460> was

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
particular cedar was a log that was

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.370 
particular cedar was a log that was
buried<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> Fraser<00:01:42.720> River<00:01:42.869> up<00:01:43.229> by

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
buried in the Fraser River up by

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.190 
buried in the Fraser River up by
Vancouver<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.430> a<00:01:45.090> guy<00:01:45.270> scoops<00:01:45.659> him<00:01:45.840> up<00:01:45.990> with<00:01:46.170> a

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
Vancouver and a guy scoops him up with a

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.890 
Vancouver and a guy scoops him up with a
big<00:01:46.439> scoop<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.250> this<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.329> denser<00:01:48.750> because

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
big scoop and and this is denser because

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.880 
big scoop and and this is denser because
it's<00:01:49.259> a<00:01:49.439> sunken<00:01:50.479> cedar<00:01:51.479> tree<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.590> we<00:01:52.710> were<00:01:52.799> able

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
it's a sunken cedar tree so we were able

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.510 
it's a sunken cedar tree so we were able
to<00:01:53.040> make<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.340> bit<00:01:53.490> thinner<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:56.159> result

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
to make it a bit thinner and the result

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.480 
to make it a bit thinner and the result
is<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:57.420> we<00:01:57.600> this<00:01:58.079> is<00:01:58.229> called<00:01:58.439> the<00:01:58.710> Bella<00:01:59.280> voce
