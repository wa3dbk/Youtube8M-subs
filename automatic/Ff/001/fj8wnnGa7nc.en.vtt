well<00:00:25.420> on<00:00:25.599> the<00:00:25.689> theory<00:00:25.900> side<00:00:26.140> of<00:00:26.290> Blackbird

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
well on the theory side of Blackbird

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:30.359 
well on the theory side of Blackbird
there's<00:00:27.240> on<00:00:28.240> one<00:00:28.570> hand<00:00:28.810> not<00:00:29.500> much<00:00:30.070> we<00:00:30.220> could

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
there's on one hand not much we could

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.890 
there's on one hand not much we could
talk<00:00:30.489> about<00:00:30.520> on<00:00:30.880> the<00:00:30.910> other<00:00:31.150> there's<00:00:31.450> a<00:00:31.509> ton<00:00:31.869> of

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
talk about on the other there's a ton of

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.150 
talk about on the other there's a ton of
stuff<00:00:32.200> we<00:00:32.320> could<00:00:32.410> talk<00:00:32.560> about<00:00:32.590> I'm<00:00:32.829> kind<00:00:33.130> of

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
stuff we could talk about I'm kind of

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.850 
stuff we could talk about I'm kind of
trying<00:00:33.310> to<00:00:33.430> find<00:00:33.670> a<00:00:34.050> happy<00:00:35.050> medium<00:00:35.230> here<00:00:35.710> to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:35.860 
trying to find a happy medium here to

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.800 
trying to find a happy medium here to
not<00:00:35.980> inundate<00:00:36.399> you<00:00:36.430> with<00:00:36.579> info<00:00:37.030> on<00:00:37.210> blackbird

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:37.810 
not inundate you with info on blackbird

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.990 
not inundate you with info on blackbird
but<00:00:38.560> let's<00:00:39.010> talk<00:00:39.100> about<00:00:39.160> the<00:00:39.430> technical<00:00:39.700> side

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
but let's talk about the technical side

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.750 
but let's talk about the technical side
first<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:41.440> finger-picking<00:00:42.160> will<00:00:42.460> look<00:00:42.579> more

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
first the finger-picking will look more

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.849 
first the finger-picking will look more
this<00:00:43.030> in<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.629> the<00:00:43.899> break<00:00:44.079> it<00:00:44.230> down<00:00:44.350> segment

00:00:44.849 --> 00:00:44.859 
this in the the break it down segment

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:47.700 
this in the the break it down segment
but<00:00:45.370> the<00:00:45.550> finger-picking<00:00:45.969> is<00:00:46.390> done<00:00:46.660> in<00:00:47.019> we're

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
but the finger-picking is done in we're

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.740 
but the finger-picking is done in we're
in<00:00:47.829> essentially<00:00:48.789> in<00:00:48.879> four-four<00:00:49.329> time<00:00:49.539> but

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:49.750 
in essentially in four-four time but

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:50.910 
in essentially in four-four time but
occasionally<00:00:50.170> there<00:00:50.320> are<00:00:50.350> measures<00:00:50.590> that<00:00:50.769> are

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
occasionally there are measures that are

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.500 
occasionally there are measures that are
not<00:00:51.100> complete<00:00:51.489> either<00:00:51.730> that<00:00:52.000> have<00:00:52.149> two<00:00:52.329> beats

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
not complete either that have two beats

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.790 
not complete either that have two beats
a<00:00:52.629> time<00:00:52.750> I<00:00:52.840> think<00:00:53.170> I<00:00:53.199> just<00:00:53.230> have<00:00:53.500> this<00:00:53.590> at<00:00:53.739> the

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
a time I think I just have this at the

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.049 
a time I think I just have this at the
beginning<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.370> really<00:00:54.760> doesn't<00:00:55.000> matter

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
beginning it really doesn't matter

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.790 
beginning it really doesn't matter
sometimes<00:00:55.359> the<00:00:55.570> first<00:00:55.750> measure<00:00:55.960> would<00:00:56.199> look

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:56.800 
sometimes the first measure would look

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:57.990 
sometimes the first measure would look
like<00:00:56.920> it<00:00:57.039> sounds<00:00:57.309> like<00:00:57.370> it<00:00:57.489> really<00:00:57.550> has<00:00:57.760> six

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
like it sounds like it really has six

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.369 
like it sounds like it really has six
beats<00:00:58.179> in<00:00:58.359> it<00:00:58.480> but<00:00:58.989> we're<00:00:59.109> really<00:00:59.230> dealing

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
beats in it but we're really dealing

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.410 
beats in it but we're really dealing
with<00:00:59.620> a<00:00:59.649> song<00:00:59.890> in<00:00:59.920> four-four<00:01:00.519> time<00:01:00.730> that<00:01:01.300> is

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
with a song in four-four time that is

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.090 
with a song in four-four time that is
keeping<00:01:01.660> a<00:01:01.749> steady<00:01:01.929> alternating<00:01:02.589> bass<00:01:02.739> going

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
keeping a steady alternating bass going

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.170 
keeping a steady alternating bass going
on<00:01:03.429> beats<00:01:04.300> one<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:05.320> two<00:01:06.010> on<00:01:06.340> b2<00:01:06.760> you'd<00:01:06.940> hit<00:01:07.090> the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
on beats one and two on b2 you'd hit the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.330 
on beats one and two on b2 you'd hit the
high<00:01:07.360> G<00:01:07.690> or<00:01:07.900> you<00:01:08.440> would<00:01:08.560> strum<00:01:08.920> if<00:01:09.159> we're

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
high G or you would strum if we're

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.450 
high G or you would strum if we're
trying<00:01:09.570> McCartney's<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:11.130> half<00:01:12.130> strum

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
trying McCartney's a half strum

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:13.800 
trying McCartney's a half strum
technique<00:01:12.880> or<00:01:13.120> for<00:01:13.330> trying<00:01:13.540> Neil's

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
technique or for trying Neil's

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.810 
technique or for trying Neil's
alternating<00:01:14.650> bass<00:01:14.770> technique<00:01:15.250> again<00:01:15.610> I<00:01:15.640> like

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
alternating bass technique again I like

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.010 
alternating bass technique again I like
to<00:01:15.880> have<00:01:16.030> students<00:01:16.330> learn<00:01:16.450> the<00:01:16.570> alternating

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
to have students learn the alternating

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.810 
to have students learn the alternating
bass<00:01:17.140> technique<00:01:17.590> first<00:01:17.800> neither<00:01:18.700> case

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.310 

a<00:01:23.909> couple<00:01:24.510> different<00:01:24.780> ways<00:01:24.870> to<00:01:24.930> look<00:01:25.110> at<00:01:25.200> the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
a couple different ways to look at the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.740 
a couple different ways to look at the
right<00:01:25.440> hand<00:01:25.590> for<00:01:25.830> blackbird<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.670> way<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.850> like

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
right hand for blackbird the way I like

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.330 
right hand for blackbird the way I like
to<00:01:27.780> have<00:01:28.080> students<00:01:28.440> learn<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.740> first<00:01:29.040> we'll

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
to have students learn it first we'll

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.160 
to have students learn it first we'll
talk<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> little<00:01:29.700> bit<00:01:29.850> later<00:01:30.030> about<00:01:30.150> how<00:01:30.659> Paul

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
talk a little bit later about how Paul

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.469 
talk a little bit later about how Paul
really<00:01:31.380> played<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.800> but<00:01:32.370> the<00:01:32.700> way<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.120> like

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
really played it but the way I like

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.900 
really played it but the way I like
people<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.750> play<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.229> using<00:01:34.950> your<00:01:35.160> thumb<00:01:35.430> to

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:35.910 
people to play it is using your thumb to

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:37.790 
people to play it is using your thumb to
play<00:01:36.090> either<00:01:36.660> the<00:01:36.900> 6th<00:01:37.229> fifth<00:01:37.440> or<00:01:37.619> fourth

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
play either the 6th fifth or fourth

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.649 
play either the 6th fifth or fourth
string<00:01:38.160> depending<00:01:38.670> on<00:01:38.760> what<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.240> mean<00:01:39.540> it's

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
string depending on what I mean it's

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.150 
string depending on what I mean it's
going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> vary<00:01:39.960> from<00:01:40.229> chord<00:01:40.680> to<00:01:40.800> chord<00:01:40.830> and

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
going to vary from chord to chord and

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.550 
going to vary from chord to chord and
then<00:01:41.729> your<00:01:42.479> thumb<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:42.930> going<00:01:43.050> to<00:01:43.110> alternate

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
then your thumb is going to alternate

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.320 
then your thumb is going to alternate
between<00:01:43.590> a<00:01:43.920> low<00:01:44.130> base<00:01:44.310> note<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.000> third

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
between a low base note and the third

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.080 
between a low base note and the third
string<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.800> means<00:01:47.070> your<00:01:47.250> first<00:01:47.520> finger<00:01:47.790> has

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
string that means your first finger has

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.609 
string that means your first finger has
nothing<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.720> do<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.990> keep<00:01:49.140> your<00:01:49.259> first<00:01:49.470> finger

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
nothing to do you keep your first finger

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.469 
nothing to do you keep your first finger
out<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.070> rotation<00:01:50.220> and<00:01:50.790> you're<00:01:51.330> just

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
out of the rotation and you're just

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.910 
out of the rotation and you're just
using<00:01:51.660> your<00:01:51.840> second<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.259> third<00:01:52.320> fingers<00:01:52.619> your

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
using your second and third fingers your

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.290 
using your second and third fingers your
middle<00:01:53.130> finger<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.520> second<00:01:53.850> string<00:01:54.000> and
