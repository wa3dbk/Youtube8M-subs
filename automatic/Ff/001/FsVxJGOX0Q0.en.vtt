00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
little bit on the sad side because it

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.540

doesn't<00:01:29.649> have<00:01:29.679> connects<00:01:30.130> and<00:01:30.250> you<00:01:30.310> can't

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
doesn't have connects and you can't

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.540 
doesn't have connects and you can't
