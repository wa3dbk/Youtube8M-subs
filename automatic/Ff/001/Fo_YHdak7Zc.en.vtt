00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.460
 Good afternoon, dear colleagues, I continue 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.900
 talk about wobblers from their combat 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.210
 boxes this 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:34.690
 skater wolf from rapala 110 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.030
 millimeters and weighing 19 grams in general 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.650
 Wobblers firm rapala rather rare in 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.600
 my box 

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.690
 Well , somehow I can not with them 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.400
 agree and 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.100
 but somehow they don't catch me I don't know 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.739
 I tried a lot but here anyway 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.900
 this one 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:56.540
 in a combat box I have only on 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.690
 firms rapala really so why 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:03.799
 because it is absolutely wonderful 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:07.070
 a walker that seems to be there and I use 

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:10.130
 by active account not loud enough 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.070
 grima x in spite of the fact that he has 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.450
 you see 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.729
 spout so sharp about how 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.430
 alucard pen but nonetheless he 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:22.460
 practically immersed in water he 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.820
 a little bit when you throw it at you 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.400
 a little bit 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.680
 so here's the tail of the bottom but none the less 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.110
 quickly goes out and makes 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.510
 really very so gorgeous 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.990
 perfect christmas tree is very easy 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:39.860
 The animations are very good cast very much 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:42.710
 easy to learn well and not much 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.380
 dear that is also not a little effective 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.360
 Generally for me, our fellow anglers 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.100
 be sure to try it but it 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.780
 really need to understand what it is 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.200
 lure such active pike he creates 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.600
 and 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.340
 wave is very big and sweeping 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.440
 motions plus this still rattles 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.140
 pretty cool in principle if we 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.080
 talking about a slider character who 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.229
 still cheeks seem to prefer me 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.280
 mostly not very noisy 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.709
 bait and this one is just for now 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.769
 really catchy thing which 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.769
 works very effectively on active 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:24.510
 pike recommend to buy your 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.510
 you will not regret the box
