00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.000 
is really beneficial
I<00:02:11.569> personally<00:02:11.840> I'm<00:02:12.079> gonna<00:02:12.230> go<00:02:12.349> to<00:02:12.410> college<00:02:12.739> but

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
I personally I'm gonna go to college but

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.589 
I personally I'm gonna go to college but
I<00:02:13.069> think<00:02:13.700> if<00:02:13.790> I<00:02:13.849> was<00:02:14.030> somebody<00:02:14.209> who<00:02:14.420> wasn't

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:14.599 
I think if I was somebody who wasn't

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:15.580 
I think if I was somebody who wasn't
going<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.900> college<00:02:15.140> that<00:02:15.230> would<00:02:15.410> really

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
going to college that would really

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:26.020 
going to college that would really
benefit<00:02:16.010> me

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.630 

so<00:02:26.630> sometimes<00:02:27.110> guy<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.530> work<00:02:27.770> period<00:02:28.190> will<00:02:28.430> be

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
so sometimes guy to work period will be

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.760 
so sometimes guy to work period will be
the<00:02:29.090> first<00:02:29.330> time<00:02:29.570> or<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.870> only<00:02:30.050> time<00:02:30.350> that<00:02:30.560> kid
