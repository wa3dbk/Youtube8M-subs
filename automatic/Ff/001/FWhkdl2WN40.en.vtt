00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.009
 good afternoon again in the first video I give you 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.800
 showed how to modify the trunk lid 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:16.080
 with the help of bolt troechki or 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:18.810
 four now show how to make money 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.920
 using vtulochki here took 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:27.930
 ordinary metal tubule 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:29.810
 diameter of 10 millimeters from the tube on 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.180
 in half and and 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:43.610
 Bulgarian cut made just such 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:43.610
 sleeve . greased see grease 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:54.890
 lubricant and now we put it on 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:57.510
 trunk lid that is, we will do something 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.969
 what our brothers didn't think to do 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.969
 smaller 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.969
 Koreans 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:23.840
 fit in the trunk and the sleeve is necessary 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:26.929
 put here on this black emphasis in 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.219
 In general, this is what we got, we see 

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:33.829
 what's a sleeve in this whites in this white 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:41.869
 guide to the end is not included but 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:45.530
 no less, it securely holds the black 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:47.060
 this barbell nose on the other hand 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:53.209
 similarly 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:02:00.950
 Here is the same vtulochka not worth it to the end 

00:01:53.209 --> 00:02:07.909
 it is clear that it is not fully included in white 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:09.950
 guides and thus black 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.040
 pusher it seems to be a little bit 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.760
 put forward now try to open 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.760
 close the trunk 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:33.349
 the trunk is closed now and here we see 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:38.530
 that the trunk has opened much he 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:38.530
 stubborn buffers can not hit again 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:57.450
 that's how we finalized the opening 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:57.450
 trunk lid all bye
