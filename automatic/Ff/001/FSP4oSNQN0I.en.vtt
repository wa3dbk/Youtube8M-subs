00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.360 
own pace just kind of explain how things
work<00:04:18.700> but<00:04:19.030> all<00:04:19.690> of<00:04:19.959> the<00:04:20.109> stages<00:04:20.440> in<00:04:20.829> this<00:04:21.010> realm

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
work but all of the stages in this realm

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.810 
work but all of the stages in this realm
you<00:04:22.330> have<00:04:22.630> to<00:04:22.900> beat<00:04:23.140> in<00:04:23.410> a<00:04:23.650> specific<00:04:23.979> amount<00:04:24.640> of

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
you have to beat in a specific amount of

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.010 
you have to beat in a specific amount of
time<00:04:25.680> this<00:04:26.680> level<00:04:27.160> you<00:04:27.340> have<00:04:27.490> to<00:04:27.610> beat<00:04:27.790> in<00:04:28.020> 35

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
time this level you have to beat in 35

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.320 
time this level you have to beat in 35
seconds

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
seconds

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.719 
seconds
I've<00:04:30.870> already<00:04:31.729> darn<00:04:32.729> well<00:04:32.970> missed<00:04:34.729> again

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
I've already darn well missed again

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.159 
I've already darn well missed again
though<00:04:36.090> I'm<00:04:36.240> playing<00:04:36.389> this<00:04:36.659> one<00:04:36.810> at<00:04:36.870> my<00:04:37.020> own

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169 
though I'm playing this one at my own

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:41.779 
though I'm playing this one at my own
pace<00:04:39.440> now<00:04:40.440> it<00:04:40.650> would<00:04:40.770> be<00:04:40.889> probably<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.460> couple

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
pace now it would be probably a couple

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.999 
pace now it would be probably a couple
three<00:04:42.360> videos<00:04:42.780> if<00:04:43.020> I<00:04:43.139> really<00:04:43.500> wanted<00:04:43.740> to<00:04:43.800> sit

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
three videos if I really wanted to sit

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.119 
three videos if I really wanted to sit
down<00:04:44.159> and<00:04:44.370> play<00:04:44.490> through<00:04:44.669> them<00:04:44.849> all<00:04:44.970> leisurely

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:46.129 
down and play through them all leisurely

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.010 
down and play through them all leisurely
but<00:04:47.129> at<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.340> same<00:04:47.490> time<00:04:47.759> it's<00:04:48.060> no<00:04:48.300> easy<00:04:48.629> task

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
but at the same time it's no easy task

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.770 
but at the same time it's no easy task
to<00:04:49.259> beat<00:04:49.590> them<00:04:49.800> in<00:04:50.069> the<00:04:50.099> allotted<00:04:53.270> so<00:04:54.270> what<00:04:54.599> I'm

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:54.780 
to beat them in the allotted so what I'm

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.649 
to beat them in the allotted so what I'm
going<00:04:55.050> to<00:04:55.080> be<00:04:55.289> doing<00:04:55.470> is<00:04:55.979> taking<00:04:56.729> her<00:04:57.300> out<00:04:57.449> here

00:04:57.649 --> 00:04:57.659 
going to be doing is taking her out here

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.980

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:03.659 
stages kind of the same way I did the

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:04.899
