jar right now the pressure canner is on
medium<00:01:42.990> heat<00:01:43.439> I<00:01:43.619> put<00:01:43.950> on<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.250> lid<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:45.030> is

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
medium heat I put on the lid and it is

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.380 
medium heat I put on the lid and it is
at<00:01:45.390> 0<00:01:45.869> pounds<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.590> pressure<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:47.430> will<00:01:47.939> turn<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
at 0 pounds of pressure I will turn the

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.249 
at 0 pounds of pressure I will turn the
heat<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.750> to<00:01:49.079> high<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:50.329> eventually<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.720> part

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
heat up to high and eventually this part

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.960 
heat up to high and eventually this part
right<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.530> will<00:01:52.979> popped<00:01:53.250> out<00:01:53.460> when<00:01:53.490> there's

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
right here will popped out when there's

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.990 
right here will popped out when there's
more<00:01:54.210> pressure<00:01:54.799> this<00:01:55.799> canning<00:01:56.310> process<00:01:56.460> is

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
more pressure this canning process is

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.539 
more pressure this canning process is
pretty<00:01:57.390> long<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.020> will<00:01:58.140> be<00:01:58.380> canning<00:01:58.979> at<00:01:59.189> 10

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
pretty long I will be canning at 10
