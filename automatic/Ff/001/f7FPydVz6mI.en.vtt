00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.050
 we're back for another video 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.540
 class and today we will give a tip 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.410
 important for those people who have 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.240
 difficulty accepting short sake 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.449
 as I'm going to vary the reception of my 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.570
 short serve how to cheat the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.070
 first opponent to serve 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.830
 short from below 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.030
 remember you always enter with the leg 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.489
 right hand and the handle open to 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.300
 its share your blow 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.110
 if you just want to put the ball 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.230
 You enter and just push the ball underneath. 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.649
 for effects down just pushes you 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:53.280
 can push long short but you 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:56.489
 You can also enter the ball under the 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:00.780
 ball and spin under the ball to the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:05.010
 right of the opponent and enters the ball and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:08.100
 turn down the ball forward 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.210
 goes in the right direction by opening 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.640
 you can also just touch push the 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.100
 ball to your opponents without effect 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.630
 Let's see how this works in practice. 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:25.020
 Notice that I'm just going to get in the ball. 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:28.820
 only putting the short ball will only return 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.820
 short may be that he does not attack me 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.910
 Watch now that I'm going to stretch the ball. 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.450
 of them only keeping the effect it comes 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.450
 coming to me 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.760
 Notice now that I'm going to go under 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.190
 using a variation of the ball by turning the 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.970
 my score for opponent right 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.970
 notes 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:48.460
 you can also get under reverse 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:52.290
 and going out will complicate a lot 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:52.290
 the life of your opponent observes 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:12.689
 are variations you can make 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.079
 I hope you have enjoyed 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:18.360
 enough this training for 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.739
 here says short serve reception short 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.379
 inside the table 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.379
 Thank you and see you on the next videotape.
