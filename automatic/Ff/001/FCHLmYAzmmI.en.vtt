00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
this is made by QuickTime this one I

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.830 
this is made by QuickTime this one I
have<00:03:08.459> not<00:03:08.550> yet<00:03:08.760> opened<00:03:08.790> up<00:03:09.209> so<00:03:09.480> this<00:03:09.570> will<00:03:09.630> be

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
have not yet opened up so this will be

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:20.990 
have not yet opened up so this will be
interesting<00:03:10.530> to<00:03:10.800> see<00:03:10.920> yeah<00:03:19.730> that's<00:03:20.730> what<00:03:20.850> that

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
interesting to see yeah that's what that

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.640 
interesting to see yeah that's what that
looks<00:03:21.150> like<00:03:21.300> holy<00:03:21.780> mackerel

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
looks like holy mackerel

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.750 
looks like holy mackerel
that<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:24.620> way<00:03:25.620> stirred<00:03:25.860> here<00:03:26.010> this<00:03:26.190> is<00:03:26.340> what's

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
that is way stirred here this is what's

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.040 
that is way stirred here this is what's
called<00:03:27.110> SFI<00:03:28.110> approved<00:03:28.620> for<00:03:29.519> drag<00:03:29.970> racing<00:03:30.420> this

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
called SFI approved for drag racing this

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.810 
called SFI approved for drag racing this
will<00:03:31.260> keep<00:03:31.410> in<00:03:31.680> case<00:03:31.890> the<00:03:32.070> clutch<00:03:32.310> explodes

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
will keep in case the clutch explodes

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.790 
will keep in case the clutch explodes
from<00:03:33.090> tearing<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.140> hole<00:03:34.170> through<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.590> floor

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
from tearing a hole through the floor

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.570 
from tearing a hole through the floor
and<00:03:34.830> cutting<00:03:35.310> your<00:03:35.340> feet<00:03:35.670> off<00:03:36.200> comes<00:03:37.200> with

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
and cutting your feet off comes with

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.630 
and cutting your feet off comes with
hardware<00:03:38.580> as<00:03:38.820> well<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:41.160> in<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.310> heart<00:03:41.489> of<00:03:41.550> the

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
hardware as well and in the heart of the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.150 
hardware as well and in the heart of the
whole<00:03:41.790> thing<00:03:42.000> is<00:03:42.480> this<00:03:43.320> 6-speed<00:03:44.010> transmission

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
whole thing is this 6-speed transmission

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.790 
whole thing is this 6-speed transmission
right<00:03:44.760> here<00:03:45.000> okay<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:45.720> what<00:03:46.019> this<00:03:46.170> is<00:03:46.380> is<00:03:46.620> this

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
right here okay so what this is is this

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.030 
right here okay so what this is is this
is<00:03:47.040> a<00:03:47.070> double<00:03:47.760> overdrive<00:03:48.269> the<00:03:48.570> four<00:03:49.500> speed<00:03:49.800> and

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
is a double overdrive the four speed and

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.240 
is a double overdrive the four speed and
most<00:03:50.670> three<00:03:51.209> speeds<00:03:51.480> and<00:03:51.840> effect<00:03:52.590> most<00:03:52.800> stock

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
most three speeds and effect most stock

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.270 
most three speeds and effect most stock
transmissions<00:03:54.030> just<00:03:54.300> period<00:03:54.600> if<00:03:55.470> they<00:03:55.709> have

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
transmissions just period if they have

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.430 
transmissions just period if they have
whatever<00:03:56.910> their<00:03:57.030> top<00:03:57.180> gear<00:03:57.480> is<00:03:57.660> is<00:03:58.230> usually

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
whatever their top gear is is usually

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.830 
whatever their top gear is is usually
going<00:03:58.769> to<00:03:58.860> be<00:03:58.920> a<00:03:59.040> one<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.640> one<00:03:59.670> ratio<00:04:00.269> that<00:04:00.690> is

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
going to be a one to one ratio that is

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.160 
going to be a one to one ratio that is
if<00:04:00.959> the<00:04:01.080> engine<00:04:01.350> is<00:04:01.440> spinning<00:04:01.800> you<00:04:02.690> know<00:04:03.690> 2,000

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
if the engine is spinning you know 2,000

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:08.780 
if the engine is spinning you know 2,000
rpm<00:04:04.440> so<00:04:04.739> is<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:04.920> driveshaft<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:06.890> what<00:04:07.890> this

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
rpm so is the driveshaft so what this

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.330 
rpm so is the driveshaft so what this
one<00:04:09.060> is<00:04:09.239> is<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.510> has<00:04:09.690> a<00:04:09.750> first<00:04:10.530> gear<00:04:10.890> of<00:04:11.130> two

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
one is is it has a first gear of two

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.670 
one is is it has a first gear of two
point<00:04:11.610> nine<00:04:11.790> seven<00:04:12.090> two<00:04:12.390> one<00:04:12.420> this<00:04:13.380> is<00:04:13.560> the

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
point nine seven two one this is the

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.350 
point nine seven two one this is the
widest<00:04:14.040> ratio<00:04:14.310> transmission<00:04:14.610> they<00:04:14.940> make<00:04:15.150> and

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
widest ratio transmission they make and

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.040 
widest ratio transmission they make and
the<00:04:16.140> sixth<00:04:16.410> gear<00:04:16.590> is<00:04:16.770> 0.5<00:04:17.640> to<00:04:18.090> 1

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.050 
the sixth gear is 0.5 to 1

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
the sixth gear is 0.5 to 1
a<00:04:19.080> fifth<00:04:19.530> gear<00:04:19.769> is<00:04:20.070> overdrive<00:04:21.000> I<00:04:21.120> think<00:04:21.300> of

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
a fifth gear is overdrive I think of

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.880 
a fifth gear is overdrive I think of
0.76<00:04:23.070> to<00:04:23.360> 1/4<00:04:24.360> is<00:04:24.660> 1<00:04:24.930> to<00:04:25.050> 1<00:04:25.080> just<00:04:25.470> like<00:04:25.590> the<00:04:25.680> 4th

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
0.76 to 1/4 is 1 to 1 just like the 4th

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:28.760 
0.76 to 1/4 is 1 to 1 just like the 4th
gear<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.610> stock<00:04:26.820> transmission<00:04:27.770> there's

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
gear and the stock transmission there's

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.380 
gear and the stock transmission there's
a<00:04:28.830> shifter<00:04:29.220> down<00:04:29.370> there<00:04:29.550> at<00:04:29.670> the<00:04:29.760> red<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:32.390> what

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
a shifter down there at the red and what

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.590 
a shifter down there at the red and what
that<00:04:33.540> means<00:04:33.750> is<00:04:34.050> that<00:04:34.880> with<00:04:35.880> the<00:04:36.120> new<00:04:36.330> rear<00:04:36.540> end

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
that means is that with the new rear end

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.940 
that means is that with the new rear end
in<00:04:36.900> this<00:04:37.050> car<00:04:37.290> at<00:04:38.070> 3.5<00:04:38.820> 5<00:04:39.120> to<00:04:39.540> 1<00:04:39.720> ratio<00:04:39.950> it's

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
in this car at 3.5 5 to 1 ratio it's

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:44.900 
in this car at 3.5 5 to 1 ratio it's
going<00:04:41.220> to<00:04:41.310> be<00:04:41.400> able<00:04:41.520> to<00:04:42.170> reduce<00:04:43.170> the<00:04:43.910> engine

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
going to be able to reduce the engine

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.390 
going to be able to reduce the engine
speed<00:04:45.120> by<00:04:45.420> a<00:04:45.450> whole<00:04:45.780> lot<00:04:45.810> if<00:04:46.380> I'm<00:04:46.920> in<00:04:47.100> fourth

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
speed by a whole lot if I'm in fourth

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.180 
speed by a whole lot if I'm in fourth
gear<00:04:47.640> it's<00:04:48.150> going<00:04:48.360> to<00:04:48.420> be<00:04:48.510> like<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.870> stock

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
gear it's going to be like the stock

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.330 
gear it's going to be like the stock
transmission<00:04:50.780> blasting<00:04:51.780> away<00:04:51.870> at<00:04:52.350> oh

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
transmission blasting away at oh

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
fourth gear at 60 miles an hour it was

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.680 
fourth gear at 60 miles an hour it was
probably<00:05:00.480> doing<00:05:00.840> about<00:05:00.960> oh<00:05:02.090> 2,500<00:05:03.090> to<00:05:03.150> 3,000

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
probably doing about oh 2,500 to 3,000

probably doing about oh 2,500 to 3,000
rpms<00:05:04.400> now<00:05:05.400> in<00:05:05.760> sixth<00:05:06.360> gear<00:05:06.540> it's<00:05:07.380> going<00:05:07.650> to<00:05:07.740> be

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
rpms now in sixth gear it's going to be

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.750 
rpms now in sixth gear it's going to be
I<00:05:09.720> think<00:05:10.140> I<00:05:10.290> calculated<00:05:10.740> it<00:05:10.830> out<00:05:11.040> at<00:05:11.280> between

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
I think I calculated it out at between

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.950 
I think I calculated it out at between
1800<00:05:12.510> and<00:05:12.630> 1900<00:05:13.700> rpms<00:05:14.700> at<00:05:15.090> 80<00:05:15.390> miles<00:05:15.630> an<00:05:15.780> hour

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
1800 and 1900 rpms at 80 miles an hour

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.920 
1800 and 1900 rpms at 80 miles an hour
so<00:05:16.710> much<00:05:17.310> better<00:05:17.610> for<00:05:18.090> fuel<00:05:18.300> mileage<00:05:18.510> much

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:18.930 
so much better for fuel mileage much

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:20.510 
so much better for fuel mileage much
better<00:05:19.140> for<00:05:19.410> reducing<00:05:19.860> wear<00:05:19.980> and<00:05:20.130> tear<00:05:20.280> on<00:05:20.430> the

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
better for reducing wear and tear on the

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.090 
better for reducing wear and tear on the
engine<00:05:20.820> and<00:05:20.880> all<00:05:21.030> the<00:05:21.150> other<00:05:21.270> components<00:05:22.100> not

to mention it works still need to get
the<00:05:27.270> clutch<00:05:27.450> for<00:05:27.750> it<00:05:27.900> and<00:05:28.050> the<00:05:28.500> drive<00:05:28.710> shaft

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
the clutch for it and the drive shaft

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.830 
the clutch for it and the drive shaft
but<00:05:29.610> those<00:05:29.760> will<00:05:29.910> require<00:05:30.240> a<00:05:30.270> my<00:05:30.510> having

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
but those will require a my having

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.010 
but those will require a my having
assembled<00:05:31.260> everything<00:05:31.940> well<00:05:32.940> oh<00:05:33.180> oh<00:05:33.810> and

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
assembled everything well oh oh and

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.100 
assembled everything well oh oh and
incidentally<00:05:34.290> it<00:05:34.560> also<00:05:34.680> comes<00:05:35.070> with<00:05:36.110> right

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
incidentally it also comes with right

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.140 
incidentally it also comes with right
here<00:05:37.410> this<00:05:37.650> other<00:05:37.830> box<00:05:38.060> is<00:05:39.060> a<00:05:39.120> tunnel<00:05:39.870> patch

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
here this other box is a tunnel patch

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:44.090 
here this other box is a tunnel patch
just<00:05:42.150> a<00:05:42.210> big<00:05:42.360> piece<00:05:42.540> of<00:05:42.570> sheet<00:05:42.840> metal<00:05:42.870> cut<00:05:43.680> to

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
just a big piece of sheet metal cut to

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.820 
just a big piece of sheet metal cut to
the<00:05:44.280> size<00:05:44.700> and<00:05:44.730> shape<00:05:45.240> that's<00:05:46.200> required<00:05:46.710> to

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
the size and shape that's required to

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.210 
the size and shape that's required to
replace<00:05:47.220> the<00:05:48.110> metal<00:05:49.110> of<00:05:49.320> the<00:05:49.500> floor<00:05:49.770> I'm<00:05:50.010> going

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
replace the metal of the floor I'm going

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.460 
replace the metal of the floor I'm going
to<00:05:50.310> cut<00:05:50.460> out<00:05:50.610> I'm<00:05:51.480> going<00:05:51.720> to<00:05:51.780> experiment<00:05:52.350> with

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:52.470 
to cut out I'm going to experiment with

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:54.320 
to cut out I'm going to experiment with
using<00:05:52.770> an<00:05:52.860> air<00:05:52.980> hammer<00:05:53.220> to<00:05:53.520> reshape<00:05:53.880> the<00:05:53.940> floor

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.330 
using an air hammer to reshape the floor

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.690 
using an air hammer to reshape the floor
first<00:05:54.690> rather<00:05:55.440> than<00:05:55.710> cutting<00:05:56.190> up<00:05:56.370> the<00:05:56.490> floor

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
first rather than cutting up the floor

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.909 
first rather than cutting up the floor
just<00:05:57.240> you<00:05:57.510> know<00:05:57.630> because<00:05:57.840> why<00:05:58.260> cut<00:05:58.650> the<00:05:58.740> floor

00:05:58.909 --> 00:05:58.919 
just you know because why cut the floor

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:01.490 
just you know because why cut the floor
if<00:05:59.010> I<00:05:59.070> can<00:05:59.220> avoid<00:05:59.310> it<00:05:59.930> but<00:06:00.930> if<00:06:00.990> it<00:06:01.200> requires

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 
if I can avoid it but if it requires

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.010 
if I can avoid it but if it requires
more<00:06:01.800> than<00:06:01.860> just<00:06:02.040> some<00:06:02.430> massaging<00:06:03.020> it's

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020 
more than just some massaging it's

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.140 
more than just some massaging it's
getting<00:06:04.560> cut<00:06:04.770> and<00:06:05.040> welded<00:06:05.430> and<00:06:05.640> this<00:06:05.880> will<00:06:06.030> be

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
getting cut and welded and this will be

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:09.770 
getting cut and welded and this will be
fun<00:06:07.130> well<00:06:08.130> I<00:06:08.280> hope<00:06:08.520> you<00:06:08.640> enjoyed<00:06:08.940> the<00:06:09.180> unboxing
