good<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.430> looks<00:01:05.700> like<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.299> 4th<00:01:06.689> prestige

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
good it looks like the 4th prestige

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.030 
good it looks like the 4th prestige
10,000<00:01:09.060> core<00:01:09.210> points<00:01:09.510> thing<00:01:09.830> when<00:01:10.830> it<00:01:10.920> only

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
10,000 core points thing when it only

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.530 
10,000 core points thing when it only
costs<00:01:11.369> a<00:01:11.460> thousand<00:01:11.880> so<00:01:12.060> it<00:01:12.150> makes<00:01:12.299> you<00:01:12.390> look

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540

this<00:01:17.490> page<00:01:17.790> is<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.060> pre<00:01:18.710> no<00:01:19.710> it's<00:01:19.860> all<00:01:19.979> right<00:01:20.009> one

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
this page is a pre no it's all right one

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.130 
this page is a pre no it's all right one
you<00:01:20.850> could<00:01:21.000> use<00:01:21.180> some<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.630> these<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:22.020> they're

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
you could use some of these but they're

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.510 
you could use some of these but they're
quite<00:01:22.380> overused<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.040> wouldn't<00:01:23.400> really

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
quite overused so I wouldn't really

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.819 
quite overused so I wouldn't really
recommend<00:01:23.640> it<00:01:25.939> okay<00:01:26.939> now<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:28.049> is<00:01:28.229> the

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
recommend it okay now this one is the

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.910 
recommend it okay now this one is the
best<00:01:29.009> one<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.640> only<00:01:30.180> costs<00:01:30.479> 3000<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.650> looks

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
best one it only costs 3000 but it looks

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.300 
best one it only costs 3000 but it looks
like<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.189> 15th<00:01:32.700> prestige<00:01:32.939> one<00:01:33.390> there's<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.630> big

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
like the 15th prestige one there's a big

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.740 
like the 15th prestige one there's a big
similarity<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.340> guess<00:01:35.610> look<00:01:36.270> at<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.540> just

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
similarity I guess look at that just

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.850 
similarity I guess look at that just
look<00:01:36.930> at<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.259> compare<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:37.770> the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
look at that and compare it with the

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.039 
look at that and compare it with the
10th<00:01:38.220> 15th<00:01:38.820> prestige<00:01:39.000> one<00:01:39.360> they<00:01:39.780> look<00:01:40.020> so

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
10th 15th prestige one they look so

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.370 
10th 15th prestige one they look so
