00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:23.970 

Oh

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:23.980 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.740 

now<00:00:24.980> that<00:00:25.220> you're<00:00:25.370> comfortable<00:00:25.640> with<00:00:26.180> the

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
now that you're comfortable with the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.440 
now that you're comfortable with the
different<00:00:27.080> stroke<00:00:27.470> types<00:00:27.800> what<00:00:28.730> we<00:00:28.850> can<00:00:29.030> be<00:00:29.150> do

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:29.450 
different stroke types what we can be do

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.630 
different stroke types what we can be do
is<00:00:29.750> begin<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:30.290> put<00:00:30.560> the<00:00:30.740> two<00:00:30.920> different<00:00:31.280> stroke

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
is begin to put the two different stroke

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.040 
is begin to put the two different stroke
types<00:00:31.970> our<00:00:32.740> taps<00:00:34.060> and<00:00:35.060> our<00:00:35.990> sweeps<00:00:37.840> put<00:00:38.840> those

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
types our taps and our sweeps put those

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.620 
types our taps and our sweeps put those
two<00:00:39.320> together<00:00:39.530> and<00:00:40.010> a<00:00:40.580> jazz<00:00:40.850> timekeeping

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:41.630 
two together and a jazz timekeeping

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.620 
two together and a jazz timekeeping
pattern<00:00:42.160> so<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.580> way<00:00:43.610> I<00:00:43.790> would<00:00:44.090> begin<00:00:44.390> is<00:00:44.600> with

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:44.630 
pattern so the way I would begin is with

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:45.880 
pattern so the way I would begin is with
the<00:00:44.870> right<00:00:45.080> hand<00:00:45.350> if<00:00:45.530> you're<00:00:45.650> right-handed

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
the right hand if you're right-handed

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.820 
the right hand if you're right-handed
what<00:00:46.760> we<00:00:46.880> want<00:00:47.059> to<00:00:47.120> do<00:00:47.270> is<00:00:47.450> take<00:00:47.720> the<00:00:48.590> right

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:48.830 
what we want to do is take the right

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:50.799 
what we want to do is take the right
hand<00:00:48.860> and<00:00:49.220> play<00:00:49.370> your<00:00:49.520> standard<00:00:50.480> jazz

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
hand and play your standard jazz

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.390 
hand and play your standard jazz
timekeeping<00:00:51.710> pattern<00:00:52.129> and<00:00:52.340> that's<00:00:53.150> the<00:00:53.540> 1<00:00:54.379> 2<00:00:55.100> 3

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:55.400 
timekeeping pattern and that's the 1 2 3

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.689 
timekeeping pattern and that's the 1 2 3
4<00:00:56.199> 01<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:57.440> you<00:00:57.589> can<00:00:57.739> just<00:00:57.890> simply<00:00:58.280> play<00:00:58.519> it

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
4 01 and you can just simply play it

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.729 
4 01 and you can just simply play it
with<00:00:58.850> taps<00:00:59.120> with<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.390> right<00:00:59.660> hand<00:00:59.930> we<00:01:00.470> want<00:01:00.650> to

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
with taps with the right hand we want to

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:02.350 
with taps with the right hand we want to
kind<00:01:00.890> of<00:01:00.920> go<00:01:01.070> back<00:01:01.460> and<00:01:01.489> forth<00:01:01.790> though<00:01:02.300> to

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
kind of go back and forth though to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.149 
kind of go back and forth though to
accommodate<00:01:03.230> what's<00:01:03.530> going<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:04.010> be<00:01:04.129> happening

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
accommodate what's going to be happening

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:06.550 
accommodate what's going to be happening
a<00:01:04.820> little<00:01:05.269> lighter<00:01:05.600> with<00:01:05.840> the<00:01:06.020> left<00:01:06.320> hand

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:06.560 
a little lighter with the left hand

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.210 
a little lighter with the left hand
which<00:01:06.860> will<00:01:07.010> be<00:01:07.130> doing<00:01:07.430> sweeps<00:01:07.840> so<00:01:09.040> we<00:01:10.040> could

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
which will be doing sweeps so we could

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:30.310 
which will be doing sweeps so we could
begin<00:01:11.680> 123<00:01:27.159> so<00:01:28.159> underneath<00:01:28.610> that<00:01:29.060> we<00:01:29.990> want<00:01:30.200> to

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
begin 123 so underneath that we want to

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.740 
begin 123 so underneath that we want to
lay<00:01:30.469> the<00:01:30.710> left<00:01:31.009> hand<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.149> left<00:01:32.329> hand<00:01:32.630> is

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:32.750 
lay the left hand and the left hand is

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:34.810 
lay the left hand and the left hand is
going<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:32.930> stay<00:01:33.409> on<00:01:33.439> the<00:01:33.770> head<00:01:34.009> in<00:01:34.250> a<00:01:34.579> sweeping

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
going to stay on the head in a sweeping

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.630 
going to stay on the head in a sweeping
motion<00:01:35.420> so<00:01:36.259> the<00:01:36.380> idea<00:01:36.560> is<00:01:36.799> kind<00:01:37.250> of<00:01:37.399> going<00:01:37.520> to

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
motion so the idea is kind of going to

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.760 
motion so the idea is kind of going to
be<00:01:37.759> like<00:01:37.939> this<00:01:38.149> where<00:01:38.420> we're<00:01:38.960> going<00:01:39.259> back<00:01:39.560> and

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
be like this where we're going back and

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.240 
be like this where we're going back and
forth<00:01:40.039> we're<00:01:40.219> alternating<00:01:41.049> positions<00:01:42.049> so<00:01:42.920> if

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
forth we're alternating positions so if

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.940 
forth we're alternating positions so if
one<00:01:43.820> is<00:01:44.299> crossed<00:01:44.869> here<00:01:45.229> we<00:01:45.350> want<00:01:45.530> the<00:01:45.649> left

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
one is crossed here we want the left

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.370 
one is crossed here we want the left
down<00:01:46.490> here<00:01:46.850> underneath<00:01:47.299> it<00:01:47.689> we're<00:01:48.200> going<00:01:48.320> to

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
down here underneath it we're going to

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.950 
down here underneath it we're going to
go<00:01:48.530> back<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:48.950> forth<00:01:49.430> so<00:01:50.240> we<00:01:50.360> kind<00:01:50.539> of<00:01:50.600> have<00:01:50.719> two

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
go back and forth so we kind of have two

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.789 
go back and forth so we kind of have two
different<00:01:51.170> zones<00:01:51.649> here<00:01:52.100> we<00:01:52.640> have<00:01:52.820> this<00:01:53.799> front

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
different zones here we have this front

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.920 
different zones here we have this front
right<00:01:55.280> part<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:55.729> the<00:01:55.789> head<00:01:56.030> for<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.719> right

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
right part of the head for the right

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.859 
right part of the head for the right
stick<00:01:57.380> and<00:01:57.759> then<00:01:58.759> this<00:01:59.000> back<00:01:59.359> part<00:01:59.659> of<00:01:59.810> the

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
stick and then this back part of the

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.499 
stick and then this back part of the
head<00:02:00.109> for<00:02:00.439> the<00:02:00.590> left<00:02:00.950> stick<00:02:01.369> left<00:02:01.670> brush

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 
head for the left stick left brush

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:05.349 
head for the left stick left brush
rather<00:02:02.869> excuse<00:02:03.409> me<00:02:03.590> so<00:02:04.250> the<00:02:04.460> left<00:02:04.729> brush<00:02:05.030> zone

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
rather excuse me so the left brush zone

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:09.070 
rather excuse me so the left brush zone
and<00:02:05.689> the<00:02:06.619> right<00:02:06.890> brush<00:02:07.189> zone<00:02:07.549> and<00:02:07.820> the<00:02:08.570> idea<00:02:08.990> is

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
and the right brush zone and the idea is

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.410 
and the right brush zone and the idea is
that<00:02:09.380> way<00:02:09.800> we<00:02:09.950> don't<00:02:10.039> get<00:02:10.220> tangled<00:02:10.550> up<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.180> get

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
that way we don't get tangled up and get

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.140 
that way we don't get tangled up and get
our<00:02:11.540> brushes<00:02:11.990> caught<00:02:12.580> so<00:02:13.580> we're<00:02:13.820> going<00:02:13.940> to<00:02:14.030> do

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
our brushes caught so we're going to do

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.760 
our brushes caught so we're going to do
this<00:02:14.300> kind<00:02:14.570> of<00:02:14.600> alternating<00:02:15.200> pattern<00:02:15.470> so<00:02:15.740> that

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
this kind of alternating pattern so that

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.820 
this kind of alternating pattern so that
might<00:02:16.040> be<00:02:16.070> something<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.700> get<00:02:16.850> used<00:02:17.030> to<00:02:17.830> so

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
might be something to get used to so

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.380 
might be something to get used to so
we'd<00:02:18.980> have<00:02:19.010> 1<00:02:19.520> 2<00:02:20.390> 3<00:02:20.840> 4<00:02:21.850> 1<00:02:22.850> so<00:02:23.030> I<00:02:23.090> would<00:02:23.240> just

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
we'd have 1 2 3 4 1 so I would just

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.030 
we'd have 1 2 3 4 1 so I would just
start<00:02:23.600> moving<00:02:23.990> back<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.410> forth<00:02:24.500> like<00:02:24.830> this

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
start moving back and forth like this

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.940 
start moving back and forth like this
and<00:02:25.280> then<00:02:25.370> you<00:02:25.460> begin

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
and then you begin

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:38.240 
and then you begin
to<00:02:26.099> hang<00:02:26.310> up<00:02:26.489> its<00:02:26.640> we<00:02:26.730> got<00:02:26.879> 1<00:02:27.120> 2<00:02:27.450> 3<00:02:28.080> 4<00:02:29.209> 12<00:02:36.319> and<00:02:37.319> you

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
to hang up its we got 1 2 3 4 12 and you

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.710 
to hang up its we got 1 2 3 4 12 and you
can<00:02:38.370> see<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:38.550> left<00:02:38.879> hand<00:02:39.060> starting<00:02:39.480> to<00:02:39.569> make

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
can see that left hand starting to make

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.460 
can see that left hand starting to make
circles<00:02:40.200> so<00:02:40.950> left<00:02:41.340> is<00:02:41.640> going<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.849> have<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:42.470> one

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
circles so left is going to have a one

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.870 
circles so left is going to have a one
down<00:02:43.709> here<00:02:44.069> two<00:02:45.030> three<00:02:46.400> four<00:02:47.400> it's<00:02:47.700> going<00:02:47.819> to

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
down here two three four it's going to

choice you can just decide what's

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.470

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
one other thing to address is I'm doing

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.300 
one other thing to address is I'm doing
this<00:03:31.760> clockwise<00:03:32.760> motion<00:03:33.739> with<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.859> left<00:03:35.100> hand

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
this clockwise motion with the left hand

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:37.599 
this clockwise motion with the left hand
and<00:03:35.579> some<00:03:36.239> people<00:03:36.510> prefer<00:03:36.930> to<00:03:37.260> do

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
and some people prefer to do

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.699 
and some people prefer to do
counterclockwise<00:03:38.690> so<00:03:39.690> that's<00:03:39.900> totally<00:03:40.380> up<00:03:40.500> to

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
counterclockwise so that's totally up to

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.039 
counterclockwise so that's totally up to
you<00:03:42.139> you<00:03:43.139> can<00:03:43.290> combine<00:03:43.470> that<00:03:43.769> with<00:03:43.829> your<00:03:44.190> cross

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
you you can combine that with your cross

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.930 
you you can combine that with your cross
right<00:03:46.049> hand<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:46.620> become<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.700> get<00:03:47.819> the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
right hand and just become to get the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.520 
right hand and just become to get the
pattern<00:03:48.150> that's<00:03:48.420> comfortable<00:03:48.810> for<00:03:48.900> you<00:03:49.139> but

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
pattern that's comfortable for you but

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:50.900 
pattern that's comfortable for you but
basically<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:49.980> want<00:03:50.069> to<00:03:50.190> go<00:03:50.280> for<00:03:50.459> that<00:03:50.579> sound

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
basically you want to go for that sound

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.090 
basically you want to go for that sound
being<00:03:51.630> crossed<00:03:52.019> and<00:03:52.440> kind<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.739> having<00:03:52.980> these

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
being crossed and kind of having these

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:55.789 
being crossed and kind of having these
zones<00:03:53.840> keeps<00:03:54.840> you<00:03:55.019> from<00:03:55.170> getting<00:03:55.319> the<00:03:55.530> brush

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 
zones keeps you from getting the brush

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.330 
zones keeps you from getting the brush
is<00:03:56.010> tangled<00:03:56.459> up<00:03:57.019> but<00:03:58.019> then<00:03:58.620> as<00:03:58.769> far<00:03:58.980> as<00:03:59.100> the

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
is tangled up but then as far as the

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.490 
is tangled up but then as far as the
clockwise<00:04:00.209> counterclockwise<00:04:00.720> whether

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
clockwise counterclockwise whether

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.080 
clockwise counterclockwise whether
you're<00:04:01.650> cross<00:04:01.889> don't<00:04:02.220> want<00:04:02.400> or<00:04:02.519> open<00:04:02.850> to<00:04:02.940> one

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
you're cross don't want or open to one

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.059 
you're cross don't want or open to one
that's<00:04:03.299> up<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.870> you<00:04:04.049> but<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.590> would<00:04:04.769> just<00:04:04.950> make

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:05.069 
that's up to you but I would just make

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:13.150 
that's up to you but I would just make
