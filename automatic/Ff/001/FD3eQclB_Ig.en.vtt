00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 hello be welcome in recipes 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.730
 roulettes the recipe of the day and give 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.920
 white chocolate with red berries and 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.059
 quarter of strawberries for 10 people 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.610
 we first need to 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.049
 make the shell 200 g of chocolate 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.390
 white and 10 g of butter 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.779
 for the red fruit mousse 250 g 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.910
 fresh or frozen red fruit 50 g 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.000
 of sugar 5 centilitres of liquid cream 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.189
 of white 2.10 strawberries for the heart of 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.470
 dom and 1 g agar agar 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.829
 I will start by putting the fruits 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.579
 red in a saucepan with sugar 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.140
 to make them compote while the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.059
 fruit compotes I can melt the 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.329
 white chocolate with a hazelnut 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.920
 Butter 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.289
 watch out I'm melting it at 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.820
 bain-marie or in a saucepan thoroughly 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.219
 thick on very soft fire because the chocolate 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.690
 white is very fragile when the 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.399
 mixture comes to a boil I'm going 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.890
 add the agar agar supplemented with 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.660
 little bit of water I mix well and I 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.629
 let it boil for a minute 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.040
 I mix to get a smooth puree I 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.020
 let cool in a salad bowl 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.000
 because white chocolate and melted I 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.619
 will come the years deep inside of them 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.659
 same where I have now taken to 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.180
 fridge or freezer some 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.780
 minutes before business a second 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.780
 layer of chocolate 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.830
 it is again cool and this 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.200
 which is what we have left quite the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.720
 melted chocolate to close our dom 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.780
 just now we put the cream in 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.780
 chantilly 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.700
 since the first days felt 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:41.710
 I add lachlan to go up in whipped cream and 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:50.530
 I'm going to mix the cream with the 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:53.430
 chantilly delicately the best I 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.430
 filled with foam 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.960
 I add a whole sentence a half 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.780
 sentence if they are big actress 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.060
 and I resort with foam and I do 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.820
 take in the refrigerator before adding 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.560
 a last vintage of white chocolate a 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.000
 once the mosses are well taken I 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.830
 remedy or another layer of chocolate 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.380
 white and dumb for that you will have to me 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.610
 believe because we have a little zapped to two 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.710
 movies and this step but you can see 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.270
 the end result guard and here we have 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:20.170
 placed chocolate and was replaced the 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.610
 fresh for it to take 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.290
 there is nothing left for us now 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.510
 junior moulay with a knife well 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.620
 sharp I just equalize the 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.540
 edges but little chocolate man 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.830
 white berries are ready and the 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.990
 unless we can say that it is 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:36.730
 will be a perfect dessert for the 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.860
 spring even for easter 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.349
 just like the delicious cake pie 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:50.740
 strawberries form of great memories 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:53.330
 if only I had known since predict what 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.830
 we find ourselves very quickly in recipes 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.450
 casters and if you do not baratelli me 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:02.990
