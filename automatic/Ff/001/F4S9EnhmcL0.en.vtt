00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.110 
popped just there and just gently work
around<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:43.250> you'll<00:02:43.459> see<00:02:43.640> it's<00:02:43.790> all<00:02:43.880> going<00:02:44.090> to

around and you'll see it's all going to

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.949 
around and you'll see it's all going to
start<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.510> come<00:02:44.630> back<00:02:44.660> to<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:44.959> part<00:02:45.260> I<00:02:46.959> think

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
start to come back to a part I think

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.600 
start to come back to a part I think
I'll<00:02:48.170> do<00:02:48.320> this<00:02:48.440> video<00:02:48.620> in<00:02:48.800> two<00:02:49.010> stages<00:02:49.250> I'm

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
I'll do this video in two stages I'm

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.250 
I'll do this video in two stages I'm
gonna<00:02:49.790> obviously<00:02:50.269> have<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:50.780> use<00:02:50.959> the<00:02:51.140> other

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
gonna obviously have to use the other

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.350 
gonna obviously have to use the other
end<00:02:51.320> to<00:02:51.680> support<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.550> way<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.730> this<00:02:53.030> and<00:02:53.209> take

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
end to support the way to this and take

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.810 
end to support the way to this and take
this<00:02:53.510> off<00:02:53.690> properly<00:02:54.019> so<00:02:54.739> I'll<00:02:55.250> do<00:02:55.400> part<00:02:55.640> two

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820
