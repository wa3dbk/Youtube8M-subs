 buryat art is becoming more 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.250

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.960
 true ethnographic decorativeness 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.600
 this whole approach he can be for me 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.600
 closer because all the same I come from 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.640
 Buryatia but the topics themselves that affect 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.190

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:35.730
 far from politics though his exhibition 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:37.860
 take place in the house of tibetan culture after all 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.380
 for many in the usa and in the west in general 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.030
 tibet is a political issue here 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:44.910

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.709
 propaganda but affiliation 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.989
 some culture are becoming 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.680
 political when most put pressure on 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.940
 minority imposes its culture 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.100
 I like the Chinese government 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.290

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.060
