00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.460
 we have an image here that is one 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:14.490
 bit to the blue side so it is 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:18.270
 an image apparently with color 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.520
 wrong with the wrong color scheme 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.260
 huh 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:24.090
 so once again here you can do 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:30.300
 the same way is you can choose 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:32.850
 here is a part of the photo that is either very 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.590
 white or dark then this will do 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.640
 with which he corrects the rest of the 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.700
 a cool way 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.149
 so you can not choose for example 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.899
 Too bad, it's too much trouble. 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.410
 photo becomes darker still okay 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.860
 So 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:56.840
 so just choose a neutral color here 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.840
 We are going back here 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:09.340
 so here it is, beauty then there's a 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.080
 little different on the y key now 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.600
 You'll see I was a little more 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.850
 dark and now it's got a little lighter 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.850
 If you do not like it very much, you do. 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.910
 You can come here, oh, the way you tie it. 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.680
 the subject to grab the slide drag to 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:28.120
 the left side or simply click 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:33.190
 here and move the mouse over to him 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:36.869
 not be so exaggerated but he's okay 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.869
 It gave the tone to you, right? 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.430
 The key to having people here again I want 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.590
 show something to you 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.680
 when you press the key have it 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.590
 shows the toolbar is and is 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.690
 if this tool of this tool of 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.100
 white clip she has here 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.170
 her tool 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.149
 we must then discard it 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.610
 automatically what is this? 

00:01:58.149 --> 00:02:03.520
 If I take a look, I just chose one. 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.040
 It's a strange thing then, folks. 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.920
 serves and unchecks automatically 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.080
 would have cleared if I had marked the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.330
 What happens? I'll click here to choose. 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.970
 a color so click the 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.790
 Oh, come on. 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:21.190
 and you get another new loupe 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.470
 tool that you quoted only then 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:26.020
 selecting it left unchecked the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.240
 which I advise you to do every time 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:32.590
 You picked a crazy color here. 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.190
 and you continue with the tool yet 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.930
 huh 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:40.390
 maybe you did not like you then 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:43.990
 choose the color that pleases you the most beauty 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:48.130
 19 here then I would change only the two 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:54.209
 points here against the oe for you to see 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:56.170
 That really made a difference. 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.890
 put it back here 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:01.890
 I used another one so 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.959
 seeing this here is the after look how 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.010
 clearer image by image became clearer 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:19.840
 beautiful, right? 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:24.670
 much more beautiful more alive here beauty 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:28.739
 This is what people are, and it's the details of 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.739
 balance tool and white
