00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.600 
you'll know because you get the feeling
as<00:04:11.630> soon<00:04:11.780> as<00:04:11.870> you<00:04:11.930> get<00:04:12.019> once<00:04:12.380> once<00:04:12.769> you<00:04:12.860> label

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
as soon as you get once once you label

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:16.330 
as soon as you get once once you label
it<00:04:13.730> correctly<00:04:14.329> and<00:04:15.170> you<00:04:15.860> write<00:04:16.040> it<00:04:16.190> down

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
it correctly and you write it down

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:18.490 
it correctly and you write it down
because<00:04:17.299> this<00:04:17.570> really<00:04:17.720> concentrates<00:04:18.380> you

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:18.500 
because this really concentrates you

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.229 
because this really concentrates you
don't<00:04:18.739> try<00:04:18.859> and<00:04:18.890> do<00:04:19.039> any<00:04:19.220> heads<00:04:19.430> but<00:04:20.030> if<00:04:20.150> you

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
don't try and do any heads but if you

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.759 
don't try and do any heads but if you
really<00:04:20.419> what<00:04:20.750> you<00:04:20.840> write<00:04:21.020> it<00:04:21.140> down<00:04:21.289> really

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
really what you write it down really

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.650 
really what you write it down really
and<00:04:21.859> then<00:04:22.490> you<00:04:22.729> look<00:04:23.150> at<00:04:23.210> it<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.479> then<00:04:23.629> you

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:23.660 
and then you look at it and then you

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.180 
and then you look at it and then you
challenge<00:04:24.169> the<00:04:24.379> thought<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:24.800> say<00:04:24.949> well

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
challenge the thought and say well

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.680 
challenge the thought and say well
what's<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.550> proof<00:04:25.819> of<00:04:26.060> this<00:04:26.270> what's<00:04:26.599> the

what's the proof of this what's the

what's the proof of this what's the

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
proof that I'm gonna make fool myself

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.990 
proof that I'm gonna make fool myself
what's<00:04:28.160> the<00:04:28.220> proof<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:28.520> everyone's<00:04:28.849> looking

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
what's the proof that everyone's looking

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.619 
what's the proof that everyone's looking
at<00:04:29.330> me<00:04:29.919> or<00:04:30.919> whatever<00:04:31.099> and<00:04:31.520> you<00:04:32.020> write<00:04:33.020> down

00:04:34.619 --> 00:04:34.629 
at me or whatever and you write down

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.119 
at me or whatever and you write down
other<00:04:35.629> instances<00:04:36.259> we've<00:04:36.409> done<00:04:36.620> a<00:04:36.680> show<00:04:36.889> like

00:04:37.119 --> 00:04:37.129 
other instances we've done a show like

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:38.800 
other instances we've done a show like
this<00:04:37.310> or<00:04:37.550> whatever<00:04:37.849> you<00:04:38.030> know<00:04:38.180> and<00:04:38.389> you've

this or whatever you know and you've

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.430 
this or whatever you know and you've
been<00:04:39.020> alright<00:04:39.560> and<00:04:39.940> then<00:04:40.940> you're<00:04:41.150> your<00:04:42.080> stress

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
been alright and then you're your stress

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.119 
been alright and then you're your stress
reducers<00:04:43.430> your<00:04:43.789> anxiety<00:04:44.240> comes<00:04:44.479> down<00:04:44.750> and

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:45.129 
reducers your anxiety comes down and

00:04:45.129 --> 00:04:47.439 
reducers your anxiety comes down and
eventually<00:04:46.129> you'll<00:04:46.400> this<00:04:46.729> becomes<00:04:47.150> your<00:04:47.300> new

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
eventually you'll this becomes your new

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:50.260 
eventually you'll this becomes your new
way<00:04:47.599> of<00:04:47.629> thinking<00:04:47.780> you<00:04:48.169> learn<00:04:48.669> to<00:04:49.669> not<00:04:49.940> go<00:04:50.210> to

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
way of thinking you learn to not go to

those<00:04:50.539> areas<00:04:50.599> and<00:04:51.349> if<00:04:51.440> you<00:04:51.530> do<00:04:51.710> go<00:04:51.949> to<00:04:51.979> those

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
those areas and if you do go to those

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.029 
those areas and if you do go to those
areas<00:04:52.280> you<00:04:52.909> learn<00:04:53.120> to<00:04:53.300> challenge<00:04:53.690> it<00:04:54.039> that

00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 
areas you learn to challenge it that

00:04:55.039 --> 00:04:58.149 
areas you learn to challenge it that
you've<00:04:55.460> got<00:04:55.729> to<00:04:55.849> get<00:04:55.940> it<00:04:56.060> early<00:04:56.800> when<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:57.830> talk

good it was and it just requires a
little<00:05:15.469> bit<00:05:15.590> of<00:05:15.710> effort<00:05:16.099> at<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.610> beginning

I meditate twice a day

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.439 
I meditate twice a day
it's<00:05:45.380> absolutely<00:05:46.180> that's<00:05:47.180> wonderful

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:47.449

it's absolutely that's wonderful
experience<00:05:48.229> meditating<00:05:48.800> but<00:05:48.889> also<00:05:49.069> you<00:05:49.969> can

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:50.300 
experience meditating but also you can

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:53.200 
experience meditating but also you can
then<00:05:50.599> check<00:05:51.050> that<00:05:51.710> everything's<00:05:52.370> okay<00:05:52.729> and<00:05:53.000> if
