at all I hate this but it's something

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.609 
at all I hate this but it's something
that<00:01:06.270> you<00:01:06.390> kind<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.780> get<00:01:06.930> used<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.229> after<00:01:07.409> you

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that you kind of get used to after you

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.429 
that you kind of get used to after you
use<00:01:07.740> it<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.070> while<00:01:08.220> to<00:01:08.250> me<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.670> handle

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439

seems<00:01:10.439> flimsy<00:01:10.979> I<00:01:11.130> guess<00:01:11.909> I'm<00:01:12.060> used<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
seems flimsy I guess I'm used to the
