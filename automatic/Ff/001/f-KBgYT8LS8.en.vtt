00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi it's not a very

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.859 
the Bluetooth and Wi-Fi it's not a very
good<00:02:01.470> point<00:02:01.830> of<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.729> company<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.270> make<00:02:03.450> both

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
good point of the company to make both

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.320 
good point of the company to make both
of<00:02:03.929> them<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.470> a<00:02:04.709> single<00:02:05.220> switch<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:05.970> cannot

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
of them in a single switch you cannot

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.680 
of them in a single switch you cannot
control<00:02:07.289> each<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.190> them<00:02:08.340> except<00:02:08.700> from<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
control each of them except from the

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.920 
control each of them except from the
functional<00:02:10.560> keys<00:02:10.860> I<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.580> switch<00:02:11.879> off<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.420> on

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
functional keys I can switch off and on

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.780 
functional keys I can switch off and on
the<00:02:13.319> Bluetooth<00:02:14.180> from<00:02:15.180> here<00:02:16.040> so<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:17.340> devices

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
the Bluetooth from here so the devices

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.809 
the Bluetooth from here so the devices
will<00:02:17.970> comes<00:02:18.270> with

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
will comes with

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:25.869 
will comes with
TD<00:02:20.239> mb<00:02:23.019> compatibility<00:02:24.019> it<00:02:24.109> could<00:02:24.319> run<00:02:24.499> a<00:02:24.879> DMV

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:25.879 
TD mb compatibility it could run a DMV

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.449 
TD mb compatibility it could run a DMV
broadcasting<00:02:26.870> which<00:02:27.409> is<00:02:27.590> not<00:02:27.739> available<00:02:28.069> in

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
broadcasting which is not available in

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.479 
broadcasting which is not available in
fact<00:02:28.849> accepting<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:30.139> Japan<00:02:30.799> and<00:02:31.099> South<00:02:31.430> Korea

fact accepting in Japan and South Korea

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.089 
fact accepting in Japan and South Korea
I<00:02:31.939> guess<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:35.109> first<00:02:36.109> of<00:02:36.230> all<00:02:36.349> we're<00:02:36.829> taking

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
I guess so first of all we're taking

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.149 
I guess so first of all we're taking
quick<00:02:37.340> look<00:02:37.519> at<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.659> device<00:02:38.930> it<00:02:39.230> takes<00:02:39.439> quite

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
quick look at the device it takes quite

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:44.309 
quick look at the device it takes quite
a<00:02:40.519> lot<00:02:40.939> of<00:02:41.120> time<00:02:41.359> to<00:02:42.019> start<00:02:42.290> from<00:02:43.250> a<00:02:43.489> cold<00:02:43.790> start

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:44.319 
a lot of time to start from a cold start

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.190 
a lot of time to start from a cold start
it's<00:02:45.319> so<00:02:46.040> device<00:02:46.700> is<00:02:46.909> working<00:02:47.120> now<00:02:47.480> music<00:02:48.079> at

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
it's so device is working now music at

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:51.580 
it's so device is working now music at
