00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.310
 drink a lot of water drink it 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.649
 must be one of the most heard 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:10.080
 Health tips are but always drink 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.570
 is that really necessary? 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.730
 asked as why confess to 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.619
 or someone went to investigate for us 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.630
 namely parama 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.550
 he comes ex others we also left league 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.500
 me waste for two years and a half 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.240
 liter makes and on top of the liter after three 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.490
 We lure them to our daily van 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.410
 run another address according to websites 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.010
 So I have to add 1.5 liters of water 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.399
 drink 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.410
 but that is not really necessary 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.300
 who is very concerned with health and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.309
 his body drink a lot of water during 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:42.410
 the day probably the most women 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.410
 and where can I find it on the editors 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.789
 shopkeeper on the board all very true 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.649
 which is always a flash to everyone b 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.809
 the games land too many bottles 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:57.329
 water at all agencies, I think that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.410
 pretty much water is drunk and 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.180
 this is mine 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.000
 shit url in water yes i only drink 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.739
 water I see water standing here 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.479
 underneath that there will be a lot of water later 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.220
 try to drink every day 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.140
 yes something like that well I'm sitting there 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.240
 ready then I also know you who she would 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.920
 I just have to try anyway think 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.000
 liters and everything to drink on a day like 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.470
 I have that bottle then one I go I 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.240
 do you think that drink so much water 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.250
 is better for your health 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.860
 i hope that's what i especially like 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.960

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.720
 if i do it then your body will be anyway 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.460
 that will be better for waste 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.320
 just like you have a lot of boyfriends something 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.780
 put on the moment they source 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.780
 nasa so I yes that looks like this 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.410
 that nice ladies are having a time 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.030
 of the tempting 7 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.030
 she drinks a lot of water so it seems to me 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.530
 ideal test subjects for an experiment 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.060
 we have with the choice of this 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.800
 subjects 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.010
 what we are going to do today and I agree 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.960
 view or with extra drinking of water 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.290
 does something about our health 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.290
 body 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.630
 we ask marie and els to do a lot 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.660
 so drink body at half past 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.550
 two times 40 extra drinks and then 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.560
 and that we just ask 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:18.400
 follow your thirst and not 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.739
 to go extra we have to drink 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.580
 both do a blood test before 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.830
 start of the test button end of the test 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.840
 we will also check urine for the 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.209
 rest and wave after the test and canter 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.850
 you all urine for ten hours you 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.530
 produces is going to collect in the ecpm 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.450
 because we could catch up on all of them 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.580
 to do tests please was money 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.580
 pleasure let the experiment that you like him 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.140
 I do good food but what about 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:53.629
 the drinking though this is the 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.650
 first super little yes but I have 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:56.420
 actually not thirsty either 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.370
 how much more is drunk 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.129
 and this is his team with my people 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:12.709
 bottle and also almost full to show small 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:21.489
 liter see many 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:21.489
 photo not so much because your pgb 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.189
 hello ladies your experiment is over 

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:29.750
 no blood play and urine sample at all 

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:33.310
 for I will deliver the same record and 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.310
 panting that can analyze for you 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.670
 that I am very curious about the 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:39.770
 results i think the picture more 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.360
 then say a thousand words 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:43.610
 marie and els who were asked from 

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.830
 extra plenty to drink also have extra 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.330
 many actually produced in 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.470
 the production of the persons who 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.210
 were asked 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.400
 have normal intake of fluid 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.960
 clearly less important is that 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.030
 roughly the waste that they 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:58.160
 excret over that number of hours 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.930
 is identical with the person who 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.580
 we drank a lot when we were the people 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.580
 who have drunk normally 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:08.870
 a protest has also been taken 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.090
 we can see that a few of you now 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.280
 drinks or normal forces blood values 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.450
 remain very nicely stable in all 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.150
 subjects 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.640
 about the course of the day so whether you now 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.530
 only 5 meters extra penetrates and therefore none 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:23.390
 difference gives no extra for it 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.250
 his body toward health 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.320
 certain conditions that we have 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:28.700
 and advising you to drink a lot is also possible 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:29.780
 no harm we stated clearly 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.000
 be to offers no added value 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.140
 how much water motor and drink during 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.090
 day 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.950
 I always say follow body you go 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.660
 will say how much you should drink 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.160
 You may not forget that in the fixed 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.640
 Nutrition that we take to us also what you 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.640
 is moisture 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:48.050
 you are still going to fish your liter of water 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.210
 drink completely empty no completely 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:54.230
 need to shun our article and less 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.760
 often drink a lot so in article they 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.320
 cute a little changes could 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:58.480
 help out 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:01.590
 flavors and always a constant anyway 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:01.590
 for experts
