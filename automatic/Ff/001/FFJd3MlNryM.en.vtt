an<00:01:39.750> inch<00:01:39.930> shorter<00:01:40.500> so<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:40.979> mainly<00:01:41.280> use<00:01:41.610> these

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
an inch shorter so I mainly use these

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.359 
an inch shorter so I mainly use these
for<00:01:42.119> volume<00:01:42.720> which<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.290> really<00:01:43.649> love<00:01:43.829> because<00:01:44.189> I

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
for volume which I really love because I

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.039 
for volume which I really love because I
do<00:01:44.820> have<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.180> lot<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.299> hair<00:01:45.570> but<00:01:45.600> my<00:01:45.780> hair<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
do have a lot of hair but my hair is

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.319 
do have a lot of hair but my hair is
thin<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.920> tends<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.310> sometimes<00:01:47.640> look<00:01:48.060> flat

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
thin so it tends to sometimes look flat

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.780 
thin so it tends to sometimes look flat
and<00:01:48.689> just<00:01:48.810> not<00:01:49.680> amazing<00:01:50.189> like<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.430> like<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.700> too

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and just not amazing like I like it too

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.030 
and just not amazing like I like it too
so<00:01:50.970> that's<00:01:51.479> where<00:01:51.720> extensions<00:01:52.229> come<00:01:52.409> in<00:01:52.530> so

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
so that's where extensions come in so

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.280 
so that's where extensions come in so
this<00:01:53.549> is<00:01:53.700> all<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.390> extensions<00:01:54.750> altogether

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
this is all of the extensions altogether

this is all of the extensions altogether
all<00:01:55.470> 10<00:01:55.680> pieces<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.250> can<00:01:56.369> just<00:01:56.549> see<00:01:56.670> like

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
all 10 pieces and you can just see like

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.999 
all 10 pieces and you can just see like
how<00:01:57.090> thick<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.990> nice<00:01:58.290> they<00:01:58.530> are<00:01:58.560> they're<00:01:58.979> just

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
how thick and nice they are they're just

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.690 
how thick and nice they are they're just
very<00:01:59.850> very<00:02:00.180> thick<00:02:00.450> from<00:02:00.719> top<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:00.990> bottom<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.860> I

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
very very thick from top to bottom and I

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.889 
very very thick from top to bottom and I
have<00:02:02.880> some<00:02:03.090> of<00:02:03.210> them<00:02:03.299> curled<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.659> don't<00:02:03.810> have

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
have some of them curled I don't have

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.149 
have some of them curled I don't have
all<00:02:04.079> of<00:02:04.110> them<00:02:04.320> curl<00:02:04.560> because<00:02:04.740> like<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.009> said

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
all of them curl because like I said

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.469 
all of them curl because like I said
on't<00:02:05.280> wear<00:02:05.399> all<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.579> them<00:02:05.850> but<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.180> ones<00:02:06.329> I

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
on't wear all of them but the ones I

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.839 
on't wear all of them but the ones I
wear<00:02:06.689> are<00:02:06.960> curled<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:08.009> that's<00:02:08.550> what<00:02:08.729> they<00:02:08.819> look

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
wear are curled so that's what they look

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:10.580 
wear are curled so that's what they look
like<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:10.319> don't

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
like and they don't

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.140 
like and they don't
match<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.979> top<00:02:11.190> of<00:02:11.400> my<00:02:11.519> hair<00:02:11.730> because<00:02:11.849> I<00:02:12.000> have

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
match the top of my hair because I have

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.460 
match the top of my hair because I have
highlights<00:02:12.480> they<00:02:12.629> match<00:02:12.780> the<00:02:12.930> bottom<00:02:13.080> part<00:02:13.440> of

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
highlights they match the bottom part of

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.309 
highlights they match the bottom part of
my<00:02:13.530> hair<00:02:13.590> pretty<00:02:14.040> well<00:02:14.220> so<00:02:14.519> that<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.319> perfect

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
my hair pretty well so that is perfect

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:18.710 
my hair pretty well so that is perfect
because<00:02:16.610> there<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:18.090> know<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.209> put<00:02:18.510> them<00:02:18.599> in

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
because there you know I put them in

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.940 
because there you know I put them in
from<00:02:18.959> around<00:02:19.080> here<00:02:19.319> but<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.530> guys<00:02:19.709> will<00:02:19.800> see

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
from around here but you guys will see

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.949 
from around here but you guys will see
so<00:02:20.489> they<00:02:20.580> blend<00:02:20.760> in<00:02:21.000> really<00:02:21.030> well<00:02:21.420> with<00:02:21.450> all<00:02:21.810> of

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
so they blend in really well with all of

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.009 
so they blend in really well with all of
my<00:02:22.110> air<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:23.540> don't<00:02:24.540> know<00:02:24.599> where<00:02:24.750> the<00:02:24.840> lighting

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
my air I don't know where the lighting

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.000 
my air I don't know where the lighting
is<00:02:25.319> so<00:02:25.349> bright<00:02:26.010> so<00:02:26.340> these<00:02:27.330> retail<00:02:27.930> for<00:02:27.959> two<00:02:28.769> and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
is so bright so these retail for two and

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.640 
is so bright so these retail for two and
$9.99<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:30.360> price<00:02:30.660> also<00:02:30.989> depends<00:02:31.470> on<00:02:31.560> the

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
$9.99 the price also depends on the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.259 
$9.99 the price also depends on the
length<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:32.160> if<00:02:32.400> you<00:02:32.489> go<00:02:32.610> shorter<00:02:33.000> it'll<00:02:33.180> be

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
length so if you go shorter it'll be

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.240 
length so if you go shorter it'll be
less<00:02:33.450> you<00:02:33.720> go<00:02:33.810> longer<00:02:34.140> it'll<00:02:34.260> be<00:02:34.349> more<00:02:34.590> so<00:02:35.129> if

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
less you go longer it'll be more so if

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.380 
less you go longer it'll be more so if
you<00:02:35.310> guys<00:02:35.400> are<00:02:35.459> interested<00:02:35.670> it<00:02:35.970> comes<00:02:36.150> with

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
you guys are interested it comes with

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.369 
you guys are interested it comes with
one<00:02:36.660> for<00:02:36.930> left<00:02:37.489> looks<00:02:38.489> like<00:02:38.519> that<00:02:39.200> these<00:02:40.200> are

00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 
one for left looks like that these are

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.960
