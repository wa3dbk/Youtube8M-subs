we<00:01:17.759> have<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:18.000> battery<00:01:18.390> included<00:01:18.960> this<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.430> turbo

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
we have a battery included this is turbo

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.270 
we have a battery included this is turbo
cell<00:01:20.820> which<00:01:21.659> I<00:01:21.810> think<00:01:22.049> it's<00:01:22.200> their<00:01:22.650> own<00:01:22.920> brand

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
cell which I think it's their own brand

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.609 
cell which I think it's their own brand
because<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:23.820> looks<00:01:24.060> just<00:01:24.360> like<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.350> Apogee

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
because it looks just like the Apogee

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.399 
because it looks just like the Apogee
aging<00:01:26.479> green<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:29.270> black<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.780> think<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.320> is

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
aging green and black so I think this is

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.770 
aging green and black so I think this is
the<00:01:31.530> brand<00:01:31.820> but<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:32.850> think<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.390> will<00:01:33.479> be<00:01:33.600> lousy

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
the brand but I think it will be lousy

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.480 
the brand but I think it will be lousy
because<00:01:34.290> all<00:01:34.530> include<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:34.950> batteries<00:01:35.159> are

because all include the batteries are

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.899 
because all include the batteries are
lousy

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
lousy

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.170 
lousy
