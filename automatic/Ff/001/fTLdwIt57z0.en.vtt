there<00:00:00.599> are<00:00:00.719> a<00:00:00.750> couple<00:00:00.810> ways<00:00:01.170> you<00:00:01.199> can<00:00:01.350> generate

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
there are a couple ways you can generate

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.579 
there are a couple ways you can generate
topspin<00:00:02.280> on<00:00:02.399> your<00:00:02.550> forehand<00:00:02.939> but<00:00:03.629> by<00:00:03.929> far<00:00:04.380> the

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
topspin on your forehand but by far the

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.710 
topspin on your forehand but by far the
most<00:00:04.770> important<00:00:05.310> one<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.819> the<00:00:06.240> direction<00:00:06.540> that

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
most important one is the direction that

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.059 
most important one is the direction that

strings<00:00:08.670> are<00:00:08.940> moving<00:00:09.599> across<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.110> ball<00:00:10.260> at

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:10.380 
strings are moving across the ball at

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.999 
strings are moving across the ball at
contact<00:00:10.940> for<00:00:11.940> example<00:00:12.360> if<00:00:13.019> I<00:00:13.230> swing<00:00:13.530> straight

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
contact for example if I swing straight

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.010 
contact for example if I swing straight
through<00:00:14.219> the<00:00:14.309> tennis<00:00:14.610> ball<00:00:14.820> this<00:00:15.540> ball<00:00:15.780> is<00:00:15.990> not

through the tennis ball this ball is not
going<00:00:16.199> to<00:00:16.350> have<00:00:16.470> any<00:00:16.680> topspin<00:00:17.340> but<00:00:18.060> if<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.300> swing

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
going to have any topspin but if I swing

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.590 
going to have any topspin but if I swing
up<00:00:18.840> across<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.920> back<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.400> ball<00:00:20.580> this<00:00:21.449> ball

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
up across the back of the ball this ball

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.090 
up across the back of the ball this ball
is<00:00:21.720> gonna<00:00:21.869> have<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> lot<00:00:22.170> of<00:00:22.320> topspin<00:00:22.800> and

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
is gonna have a lot of topspin and

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.519 
is gonna have a lot of topspin and
that's<00:00:23.880> despite<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.510> fact<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.869> my<00:00:25.140> strings

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
that's despite the fact that my strings

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.170 
that's despite the fact that my strings
are<00:00:25.769> facing<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> same<00:00:26.430> direction<00:00:26.760> for<00:00:26.970> the

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
are facing the same direction for the

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.960 
are facing the same direction for the
flat<00:00:27.449> ball<00:00:27.750> and<00:00:28.050> the<00:00:28.830> topspin<00:00:29.220> ball<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.580> again

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
flat ball and the topspin ball so again

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.970 
flat ball and the topspin ball so again
it's<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.750> direction<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.439> strings<00:00:31.800> are

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
it's the direction the strings are

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.600 
it's the direction the strings are
moving<00:00:32.399> at<00:00:32.660> contact<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:34.200> influences<00:00:35.010> what

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
moving at contact that influences what

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.190 
moving at contact that influences what
kind<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.910> spin<00:00:36.239> I'm<00:00:36.480> gonna<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.899> on<00:00:36.930> my

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
kind of spin I'm gonna have on my

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.780 
kind of spin I'm gonna have on my
forehand<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:37.980> goes<00:00:38.160> for<00:00:38.340> topspin

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
forehand and that goes for topspin

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.470 
forehand and that goes for topspin
backspin<00:00:39.780> whatever<00:00:40.469> let's<00:00:41.340> go<00:00:41.430> to<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.670> fyb<00:00:42.000> TV

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
backspin whatever let's go to the fyb TV

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.139 
backspin whatever let's go to the fyb TV
screen<00:00:42.780> and<00:00:43.129> watch<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.340> high-speed<00:00:44.550> footage

of Frank Salazar hitting a forehand to
illustrate<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.539> point<00:00:48.950> now<00:00:49.950> Frank<00:00:50.280> is<00:00:50.399> gonna

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
illustrate this point now Frank is gonna

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.729 
illustrate this point now Frank is gonna
swing<00:00:50.910> from<00:00:51.120> below<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.780> tennis<00:00:52.110> ball<00:00:52.320> up

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
swing from below the tennis ball up

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.540 
swing from below the tennis ball up
across<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.340> ball<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.930> contact<00:00:54.930> and<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.370> go

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
across the ball at contact and if we go

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.939 
across the ball at contact and if we go
back<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.180> his<00:00:57.480> contact<00:00:58.050> point<00:00:58.350> you'll<00:00:58.800> notice

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
back to his contact point you'll notice

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.540 
back to his contact point you'll notice
that<00:00:59.370> his<00:00:59.879> stirrings<00:01:00.239> are<00:01:00.530> facing<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:02.010> net<00:01:02.250> so

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
that his stirrings are facing the net so

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.640 
that his stirrings are facing the net so
again<00:01:02.910> because<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.960> strings<00:01:04.260> are<00:01:04.409> swinging

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
again because the strings are swinging

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.160 
again because the strings are swinging
across<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.430> back<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.820> ball<00:01:06.030> that's<00:01:06.780> why

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
across the back of the ball that's why

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.440 
across the back of the ball that's why
that<00:01:07.830> ball<00:01:08.130> is<00:01:08.250> gonna<00:01:08.400> have<00:01:08.580> topspin<00:01:09.150> on<00:01:09.330> it

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
that ball is gonna have topspin on it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.210 
that ball is gonna have topspin on it
not<00:01:09.630> because<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.110> strings<00:01:10.380> are<00:01:10.530> just<00:01:10.740> facing

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
not because the strings are just facing

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.760 
not because the strings are just facing
the<00:01:11.460> net<00:01:11.729> when<00:01:11.970> he<00:01:12.060> hits<00:01:12.299> for<00:01:13.140> comparison's

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the net when he hits for comparison's

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.520 
the net when he hits for comparison's
sake<00:01:13.979> let's<00:01:14.580> go<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.909> some<00:01:15.780> high-speed<00:01:15.990> of

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
sake let's go to some high-speed of

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.920 
sake let's go to some high-speed of
Oliver<00:01:17.100> Ackley<00:01:17.610> hitting<00:01:18.180> a<00:01:18.270> sliced<00:01:18.630> backhand

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
Oliver Ackley hitting a sliced backhand

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.160 
Oliver Ackley hitting a sliced backhand
and<00:01:19.470> he's<00:01:20.250> gonna<00:01:20.400> have<00:01:20.610> under<00:01:21.180> spin<00:01:21.450> backspin

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and he's gonna have under spin backspin

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.170 
and he's gonna have under spin backspin
on<00:01:22.229> this<00:01:22.500> ball<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:23.009> he's<00:01:23.130> swinging<00:01:23.490> down

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
on this ball because he's swinging down

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.039 
on this ball because he's swinging down
on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:25.080> tennis<00:01:25.380> ball<00:01:25.619> at<00:01:25.970> contact<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.240> if<00:01:27.900> we

on the tennis ball at contact and if we
freeze<00:01:28.439> at<00:01:28.890> his<00:01:29.310> contact<00:01:29.880> point<00:01:30.180> you'll

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
freeze at his contact point you'll

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.560 
freeze at his contact point you'll
notice<00:01:31.170> that<00:01:31.320> his<00:01:31.470> strings<00:01:31.829> are<00:01:32.040> more<00:01:32.369> or<00:01:32.490> less

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
notice that his strings are more or less

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.770 
notice that his strings are more or less
facing<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.840> net<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.290> well<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.479> can<00:01:36.600> hit

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
facing the net as well so you can hit

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.179 
facing the net as well so you can hit
with<00:01:36.990> backspin<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.950> strings

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
with backspin and have the strings

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.649 
with backspin and have the strings
facing<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.670> net<00:01:38.820> or<00:01:39.030> you're<00:01:39.270> gonna<00:01:39.360> hit<00:01:39.509> with

facing the net or you're gonna hit with

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.660 
facing the net or you're gonna hit with
topspin<00:01:40.110> and<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:40.860> strings<00:01:41.130> facing<00:01:41.579> the

if<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.829> freeze<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.220> two<00:01:53.369> shots<00:01:53.640> at<00:01:53.850> contact

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
if we freeze the two shots at contact

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.289 
if we freeze the two shots at contact
the<00:01:55.619> strings<00:01:55.979> are<00:01:56.250> more<00:01:56.549> or<00:01:56.640> less<00:01:56.700> facing<00:01:57.210> the

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the strings are more or less facing the

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.170 
the strings are more or less facing the
net<00:01:57.450> on<00:01:57.600> both<00:01:58.049> shots<00:01:58.350> despite<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.579> fact<00:01:59.880> that

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
net on both shots despite the fact that

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.539 
net on both shots despite the fact that
these<00:02:01.140> two<00:02:01.200> balls<00:02:01.799> are<00:02:02.009> gonna<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
these two balls are gonna have the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.929 
these two balls are gonna have the
opposite<00:02:03.210> spins<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.170> them<00:02:04.520> what<00:02:05.520> this<00:02:05.670> means

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
opposite spins on them what this means

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.199 
opposite spins on them what this means
for<00:02:06.180> your<00:02:06.360> forehand<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.280> you<00:02:08.280> can<00:02:08.520> vary<00:02:09.000> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
for your forehand is you can vary the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.150 
for your forehand is you can vary the
amount<00:02:09.239> then<00:02:09.660> you<00:02:09.720> swing<00:02:10.110> up<00:02:10.319> across<00:02:10.739> the<00:02:10.979> ball

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
amount then you swing up across the ball

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.140 
amount then you swing up across the ball
at<00:02:11.400> contact<00:02:12.090> and<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.480> will<00:02:12.660> vary

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
at contact and that will vary

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.300 
at contact and that will vary
of<00:02:13.510> spin<00:02:13.750> you<00:02:13.900> put<00:02:13.930> on<00:02:14.200> the<00:02:14.319> ball<00:02:14.500> for<00:02:15.250> a

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
of spin you put on the ball for a

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.160 
of spin you put on the ball for a
classic<00:02:15.849> forehand<00:02:16.329> where<00:02:16.810> you're<00:02:16.959> pretty

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
classic forehand where you're pretty

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.479 
classic forehand where you're pretty
much<00:02:17.319> swinging<00:02:17.680> through<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.099> ball<00:02:18.280> like

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
much swinging through the ball like

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.009 
much swinging through the ball like
we've<00:02:18.700> taught<00:02:18.909> in<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.239> fundamentals<00:02:19.840> section

00:02:20.009 --> 00:02:20.019 
we've taught in the fundamentals section

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.080 
we've taught in the fundamentals section
you'll<00:02:20.799> certainly<00:02:21.040> get<00:02:21.400> some<00:02:21.430> topspin<00:02:21.970> on

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
you'll certainly get some topspin on

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.360 
you'll certainly get some topspin on
those<00:02:22.299> balls<00:02:22.540> but<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.349> won't<00:02:23.590> get<00:02:23.769> as<00:02:23.890> much<00:02:24.099> as

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
those balls but you won't get as much as

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.250 
those balls but you won't get as much as
if<00:02:24.879> you<00:02:25.060> were<00:02:25.180> hitting<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.629> windshield<00:02:25.930> wiper

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
if you were hitting a windshield wiper

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.069 
if you were hitting a windshield wiper
forehand<00:02:27.010> where<00:02:27.760> you<00:02:28.030> really<00:02:28.450> swing<00:02:28.780> up

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
forehand where you really swing up

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:32.220 
forehand where you really swing up
across<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.859> ball<00:02:30.239> brush<00:02:31.239> up<00:02:31.480> across<00:02:31.900> it<00:02:32.140> and

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
across the ball brush up across it and

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.410 
across the ball brush up across it and
that's<00:02:32.409> why<00:02:32.620> you<00:02:32.680> get<00:02:32.950> much<00:02:33.489> more<00:02:33.519> spin<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.299> the

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
that's why you get much more spin so the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.720 
that's why you get much more spin so the
next<00:02:34.599> time<00:02:34.780> you<00:02:34.870> go<00:02:34.989> on<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.170> court<00:02:35.489> vary<00:02:36.489> the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
next time you go on the court vary the

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.819 
next time you go on the court vary the
amount<00:02:36.849> you<00:02:37.209> swing<00:02:37.480> up<00:02:37.720> across<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.470> back<00:02:38.650> of

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
amount you swing up across the back of

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.280 
amount you swing up across the back of
the<00:02:38.890> ball<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.280> that<00:02:39.340> will<00:02:39.730> consequently

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
the ball and that will consequently

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.899 
the ball and that will consequently
change<00:02:41.290> the<00:02:41.500> amount<00:02:41.769> of<00:02:41.920> topspin<00:02:42.519> you're

00:02:42.899 --> 00:02:42.909 
change the amount of topspin you're

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.359 
change the amount of topspin you're
generating
