00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.649

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.030
 hello youtubers welcome dynamic 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.170
 that we are once again in a new 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.090
 video as you are seeing in our 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:17.529
 screens here we are with a new 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.390
 trade using the method that 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:21.189
 lately it's pretty fashionable already 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:22.360
 you know if I'm going to put a strip where 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.330
 you are seeing that we are looking for 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.980
 looking for this right now is to say it 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.420
 somehow as light as possible 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.130
 that I can share with you for 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.470
 then make a summary and that the video 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:35.050
 you do not have us there at 50 minutes worth 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.420
 guys, I'm looking for success here because 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.250
 the left side you already know that there was 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.080
 a tournament of the Italians that I'm going to 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.030
 share with you well we are going to 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.559
 take advantage of the tournaments and I'm going to 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.449
 give the reasons why and what 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:49.720
 players select and at what time 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.059
 ok you see that he visited 82 of pace one 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.400
 letter not special or not bright 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.989
 left side and at the time of 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.940
 people who want to go to a tournament go to 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.290
 look for a particular side that is going to 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.049
 happen that you are going to find that all 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:03.640
 they have very low pace really the best 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:05.379
 to put it some way is this 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.210
 player and so all the people are going 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:08.530
 to go for that guy that's going to be good 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.659
 then to the people who touch them 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.610
 envelopes, the safest thing is that they do not have 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.640
 fucking idea that there is a tournament or maybe 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:16.690
 he has no idea that an Italian tournament 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.760
 they do not know what is the best lateral 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.050
 left than in the Italians and so on 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.760
 etcetera etcetera 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.990
 now we started already you saw later already 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.850
 vision at the beginning of the method that 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.560
 we were trying the search and you 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.060
 I'm going to put a summary where you are going 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.280
 for the prices that I am buying them 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.350
 guys for you to see that this 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.880
 it's totally effective and then neighbors 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.490
 of everything now as always I put you for 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.290
 how much we have sold it is worth saying everything 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.570
 this we will continue because this player 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.790
 in particular and why and I do not know what I do not know 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.350
 how much good then people when they 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.759
 he plays this player many times because he does not 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.340
 have no idea that there is an Italian lathe 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:51.100
 they see it's not uncommon and it really 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.990
 they think that the price is down to 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.490
 bear boy are used to each other 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:56.320
 they knew this player's assistance 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.119
 this player we are used to that 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.280
 its price was therefore around the 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.539
 2,000 2,500 3,000 and they will follow 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.710
 putting for that price always and 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:04.869
 we are looking for you to take advantage of that 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.520
 looking for him saying the first one in 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.080
 buy it, it's okay, guys, let's go 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.459
 look for the pin pin pin pin let's go 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.959
 modifying the price so that we are not 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.640
 get stuck and we will meet 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.430
 players as you are already watching for two 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.709
 one thousand five hundred coins for 1500 for three 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.820
 thousand by four thousand I would not sign it for 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.890
 that you are seeing as soon as 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.300
 we are putting what happens with that trade 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:26.380
 or as always 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.480
 very much like hers but applying 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.010
 and other good and other thoughts 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.750
 we are taking advantage of some of the tournaments 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.880
 imagine that tomorrow comes a 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:35.200
 tournament because it is currently in the 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.690
 Mexicans, we could take advantage of 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.580
 of the Mexicans is not that the 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.140
 tournament and you have to do it at the time 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.640
 next or nothing that you can do it 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.930
 throughout the week the only thing that 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.760
 you have to do is look for a player 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.240
 with specific characteristics and 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.470
 that you know, for example, imagine 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.600
 if they leave Spanish 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.340
 mc or the people are going to look for one 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.650
 pretty fast so and so we can 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.240
 do it with alley or with Íñigo 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.490
 martínez in the defense of the real 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.470
 So what do you mean by this? 

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.240
 that we can really take advantage of 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.640
 all the tournaments that there are always 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.380
 doing these kinds of methods for me is 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.000
 most effective because lately 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.860
 I'm always trying like this 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.420
 way searching and modifying the 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.950
 prices but always with other 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.540
 conditions why I already tell you 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.340
 I always try to share with you 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.050
 the medium as such that you after 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.660
 you develop it also I'm 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:24.580
 asking a lot about the web I wish 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.960
 sooner or later opens the web to talk 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.580
 for all kinds because it will not be for 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.540
 everyone is sorry for stressing much more 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.069
 simple 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.540
 6 seeing that they keep buying there you have 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.609
 another one thousand coins 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.680
 and so on continuously and then at the end 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:37.810
 look for how much we have sold them 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.280
 they always sell 159 so do not you 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.049
 worry about buying them and then 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.700
 put them because you are going to go always 

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:44.620
 winning coins and winning and winning and 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.540
 winning like that in the 59th minute is beige go 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.370
 little by little covering what I'm going to 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.870
 tell you to keep in mind that from time to time 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.310
 when you go see the price if 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.750
 you are a few hours working so 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.129
 You can reach 100,000 coins in 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.049
 a few hours already I already tell you from 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:57.939
 Now if you apply time you will remove 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:59.590
 a lot of money and that way you will be able to be 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.569
 prepared for the whole then really 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:03.459
 what you have to do is that and go 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.260
 looking for the price to see how much it 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.609
 are selling and if they changed or if 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.200
 They varied from one hour to another always 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.819
 looking for the minimum purchase price already 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.310
 of this player that in this case already 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.370
 you are seeing that it was 4,400 coins and 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.560
 I took 2 thousand 200 3000 and 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.419
 etcetera etcetera etcetera good i want 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.769
 clarify after sharing 60 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:22.479
 of ccoo minutes I already tell you we make a 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.340
 brief summary Italian championship where 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.320
 I'm looking for a specific player who has 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.509
 some qualities that I bring the 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.949
 benefit is always worth me in this 

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:31.449
 case use a player that was the best 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.729
 to put it somehow the best 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:36.450
 left lateral so that people 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.380
 out to look for or that people 

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:41.590
 because it was the one with the most rhythm 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:46.030
 although even if it was not a letter 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:48.340
 not rare if you 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:51.190
 you are looking for a player that is special or 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.410
 that is the best or that or that has more 

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.730
 rhythm in defense or such you always go to 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.860
 be able to do it throughout the week 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:57.910
 ok guys, I tell you, I share with 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.040
 you and your method of 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.390
 you develop here you have one and then 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:03.190
 shoots you and also another kind of 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:05.050
 things that you use for back of area that 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.880
 you know I'm full right now for 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.310
 collect coins for later finally 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.090
 apply the top what do you mean 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.980
 with this 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:13.180
 well well on the tops if you do not have 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.260
 coins you have a page in the 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.240
 description that is totally 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.890
 recommended since it is the best in Spain 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.990
 the cheapest and you have three or four 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:21.490
 super reliable purchasing methods so 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:22.930
 I recommend it if you do not have money because 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:25.210
 comes close to the toxics and we have to 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.160
 have money if you are already like me like me 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.860
 difficult able to gather in a million and 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.660
 perfect peak serves us and we have enough to 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.220
 triple then do what they do 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.080
 the eggs with him good that we already arrived 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.490
 at the end of the video I hope I have been 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.650
 as clear as possible worth guys so that 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:39.820
 you understand me x between a trade or quickie 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.800
 and above all 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.930
 good fast and with benefits like 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.400
 you have seen and with this I already say goodbye 

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.230
 guys, I 'm telling you to apply the most 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.910
 possible time that is the most that 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.620
 You can yes to go removing pasta and pasta 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.750
 and will continue to accumulate and accumulate and 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.250
 so we can get as much as possible 

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:55.900
 but have the description page for 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:57.310
 to buy coins so as always 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.870
 kids and I hope I 'm looking for a law if it has 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:03.340
 liked the video your comments if 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:05.949
 you have some doubt and the next kids 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:08.110

 vile bargaining was poor until you gave me your 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:12.040
