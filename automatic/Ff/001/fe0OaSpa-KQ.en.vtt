00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
may be cool maybe the dev team will

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.050 
may be cool maybe the dev team will
update<00:02:50.599> this<00:02:50.959> to<00:02:51.319> make<00:02:51.470> it<00:02:51.620> work<00:02:51.769> better<00:02:51.980> but<00:02:52.459> I

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060 
update this to make it work better but I
