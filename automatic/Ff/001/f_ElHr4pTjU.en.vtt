it's actually carbon fiber you can hear

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.080 
it's actually carbon fiber you can hear
it<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.399> feel<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.609> when<00:01:32.789> you<00:01:32.850> sweep<00:01:33.060> your

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090

it and feel it when you sweep your
fingernail<00:01:33.630> across<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.590> looks<00:01:34.829> really<00:01:35.100> cool

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
fingernail across it looks really cool

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.310 
fingernail across it looks really cool
you<00:01:35.490> shine<00:01:35.700> it<00:01:35.850> in<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.000> light<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.450> also<00:01:36.990> gives

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
you shine it in the light and also gives

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.590 
you shine it in the light and also gives
you<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.469> ton<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.189> ton<00:01:38.219> of<00:01:38.490> grip<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.240> it's<00:01:39.270> really

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
you a ton a ton of grip so it's really

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.230 
you a ton a ton of grip so it's really
nice<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:40.049> you're<00:01:40.560> not<00:01:40.829> wanting<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.250> case<00:01:41.460> you

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
nice if you're not wanting a case you

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.429 
nice if you're not wanting a case you
shouldn't<00:01:42.450> really<00:01:42.600> worry<00:01:42.780> too<00:01:42.929> much<00:01:43.109> because

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
shouldn't really worry too much because

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.740 
shouldn't really worry too much because
I'll<00:01:43.649> provide<00:01:43.829> scratch<00:01:44.429> protection<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.210> then

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
I'll provide scratch protection and then

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.569 
I'll provide scratch protection and then
it<00:01:45.869> will<00:01:46.020> also<00:01:46.259> provide<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.710> lot<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:46.979> grip<00:01:47.250> now

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it will also provide a lot of grip now

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.490 
it will also provide a lot of grip now

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
this is a full-body skin in the model

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.800 
this is a full-body skin in the model
that<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.859> got<00:01:50.159> so<00:01:50.670> will<00:01:50.880> cover<00:01:51.119> pretty<00:01:51.689> much

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
that I got so will cover pretty much

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.630 
that I got so will cover pretty much
every<00:01:52.200> part<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.500> your<00:01:52.649> phone<00:01:52.859> then<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.490> see

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
every part of your phone then you see

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.889 
every part of your phone then you see
there<00:01:53.789> were<00:01:53.880> some<00:01:54.090> white<00:01:54.270> spots<00:01:54.509> on<00:01:54.750> the

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
there were some white spots on the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.810 
there were some white spots on the
corners<00:01:55.259> around<00:01:55.469> the<00:01:55.649> edges<00:01:56.039> and<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:56.640> also

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
corners around the edges and then also

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.700 
corners around the edges and then also
around<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.509> camera<00:01:58.020> there's<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.409> little<00:01:58.619> bit

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
around the camera there's a little bit

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.560 
around the camera there's a little bit
of<00:01:58.799> whiteness<00:01:59.219> I<00:01:59.460> saw<00:01:59.820> some<00:01:59.999> other<00:02:00.090> skins<00:02:00.450> too

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
of whiteness I saw some other skins too

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.149 
of whiteness I saw some other skins too
some<00:02:00.719> other<00:02:00.899> manufacturers<00:02:01.380> include<00:02:01.920> pieces

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
some other manufacturers include pieces

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.770 
some other manufacturers include pieces
there<00:02:02.609> to<00:02:02.759> cover<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:02.999> up<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.600> would<00:02:03.689> have

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
there to cover it up that would have

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.950 
there to cover it up that would have
been<00:02:03.869> nice<00:02:04.020> not<00:02:04.409> necessarily<00:02:05.130> necessary<00:02:05.960> but

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
been nice not necessarily necessary but

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.169 
been nice not necessarily necessary but
it<00:02:07.289> would<00:02:07.740> have<00:02:07.829> been<00:02:08.310> cool<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.759> really<00:02:09.000> have

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
it would have been cool to really have

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.750 
it would have been cool to really have
the<00:02:09.360> whole<00:02:09.599> thing<00:02:09.629> one<00:02:10.440> particular<00:02:10.950> color<00:02:11.190> but

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
the whole thing one particular color but

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.630 
the whole thing one particular color but
like<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:11.909> said<00:02:12.180> it's<00:02:12.269> not<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.390> big<00:02:12.450> deal

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
like I said it's not a big deal

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.280 
like I said it's not a big deal
across<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.210> top<00:02:14.420> there<00:02:14.630> were<00:02:14.750> some<00:02:14.960> edges

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
across the top there were some edges

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.530 
across the top there were some edges
there<00:02:15.470> that<00:02:15.800> wasn't<00:02:16.130> fully<00:02:16.340> covered<00:02:16.819> that's

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
there that wasn't fully covered that's

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.900 
there that wasn't fully covered that's
really<00:02:17.780> just<00:02:17.900> did<00:02:18.140> design<00:02:18.709> of<00:02:18.980> the<00:02:19.280> g3<00:02:19.790> you

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
really just did design of the g3 you

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.910 
really just did design of the g3 you
can't<00:02:20.120> really<00:02:20.330> put<00:02:20.690> anything<00:02:20.930> there<00:02:21.230> but<00:02:21.800> it

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
can't really put anything there but it

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.740 
can't really put anything there but it
wasn't<00:02:22.160> really<00:02:22.340> nice<00:02:22.610> looking<00:02:22.940> skin<00:02:23.330> that<00:02:23.360> fit

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
wasn't really nice looking skin that fit

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.260 
wasn't really nice looking skin that fit
pretty<00:02:23.930> much<00:02:24.080> everywhere<00:02:24.500> around<00:02:24.709> nicely<00:02:25.400> now

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
pretty much everywhere around nicely now

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.790 
pretty much everywhere around nicely now
the<00:02:26.330> only<00:02:26.600> downside<00:02:27.020> I<00:02:27.050> had<00:02:27.260> to<00:02:27.410> this<00:02:27.530> would<00:02:27.770> be

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
the only downside I had to this would be

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.949 
the only downside I had to this would be
the<00:02:28.069> fact<00:02:28.310> that<00:02:28.400> it<00:02:28.640> does<00:02:28.850> not<00:02:28.880> allow<00:02:29.360> access

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
the fact that it does not allow access

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:32.080 
the fact that it does not allow access
to<00:02:29.990> the<00:02:30.170> back<00:02:30.440> cover<00:02:30.709> removal<00:02:31.190> this<00:02:31.640> is<00:02:31.850> due<00:02:31.940> to

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
to the back cover removal this is due to

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.820 
to the back cover removal this is due to
the<00:02:32.240> very<00:02:32.510> top<00:02:32.780> and<00:02:32.810> the<00:02:33.020> very<00:02:33.050> bottom<00:02:33.590> they

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:33.830 
the very top and the very bottom they

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.460 
the very top and the very bottom they
overlap<00:02:34.400> where<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.820> cover<00:02:35.120> comes<00:02:35.360> off<00:02:35.570> so<00:02:36.140> as

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
overlap where the cover comes off so as

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.080 
overlap where the cover comes off so as
long<00:02:36.709> as<00:02:36.770> you<00:02:36.950> don't<00:02:37.040> put<00:02:37.250> those<00:02:37.490> on<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.940> you

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
long as you don't put those on and you

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:40.510 
long as you don't put those on and you
be<00:02:38.240> careful<00:02:38.660> when<00:02:38.930> you<00:02:39.110> apply<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.680> side

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
be careful when you apply the side

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.400 
be careful when you apply the side
pieces<00:02:40.760> then<00:02:41.660> you<00:02:41.810> should<00:02:42.050> be<00:02:42.140> able<00:02:42.200> to<00:02:42.290> get

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
pieces then you should be able to get

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.780 
pieces then you should be able to get
the<00:02:42.500> back<00:02:42.620> cover<00:02:42.860> off<00:02:42.950> but<00:02:43.310> if<00:02:43.400> you<00:02:43.459> put<00:02:43.640> on<00:02:43.670> the

the back cover off but if you put on the
top<00:02:44.090> and<00:02:44.300> bottom<00:02:44.390> you<00:02:44.780> will<00:02:45.260> not<00:02:45.380> be<00:02:45.560> able<00:02:45.680> to

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739
