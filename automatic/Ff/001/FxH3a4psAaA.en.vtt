00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
their high school physics and said

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.350 
their high school physics and said
there's<00:02:16.510> gas

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
there's gas

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.020 
there's gas
controller<00:02:17.840> so<00:02:18.080> it's<00:02:18.230> cold<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:19.160> we<00:02:19.820> have<00:02:20.000> our

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
controller so it's cold so we have our

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.640 
controller so it's cold so we have our
special<00:02:20.270> effects<00:02:20.810> guys<00:02:21.050> out<00:02:21.320> there<00:02:21.530> in

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
blast in the out of these godless

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.140 
blast in the out of these godless
to<00:02:29.210> get<00:02:29.390> that<00:02:29.540> gas<00:02:29.920> homicidal<00:02:30.920> estate<00:02:31.340> let's

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
to get that gas homicidal estate let's

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.340 
to get that gas homicidal estate let's
say<00:02:32.300> open<00:02:32.660> for<00:02:32.870> a<00:02:32.900> whole<00:02:33.110> tape<00:02:35.020> somebody<00:02:36.020> asked

now<00:04:15.780> there's<00:04:16.020> a<00:04:16.170> few<00:04:16.380> years<00:04:16.560> later<00:04:16.830> we<00:04:17.700> decided

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
now there's a few years later we decided

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.840 
now there's a few years later we decided
that<00:04:18.180> we<00:04:18.330> needed<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.660> make<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:20.459> time<00:04:20.700> machine

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
that we needed to make the time machine

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:26.930 
that we needed to make the time machine
mobile<00:04:22.730> it<00:04:23.730> made<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.090> lot<00:04:24.240> more<00:04:24.300> sense<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.940> of

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:26.940 
mobile it made a lot more sense and of

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.000 
mobile it made a lot more sense and of
course<00:04:27.240> we<00:04:27.420> had<00:04:27.600> to<00:04:27.630> find<00:04:27.930> a<00:04:28.110> really<00:04:28.320> cool<00:04:28.650> car

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
course we had to find a really cool car

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:35.840 
course we had to find a really cool car
and<00:04:29.900> the<00:04:30.950> idea<00:04:31.950> of<00:04:32.400> the<00:04:32.790> going<00:04:33.720> door<00:04:34.080> and<00:04:34.850> the

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
and the idea of the going door and the

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.630 
and the idea of the going door and the
concept<00:04:36.600> that<00:04:36.690> in<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.170> 50s<00:04:37.650> this<00:04:38.430> would<00:04:38.610> be

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
concept that in the 50s this would be

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.750 
concept that in the 50s this would be
mistaken<00:04:38.940> for<00:04:39.270> flying<00:04:39.720> saucer<00:04:40.380> that<00:04:41.220> was<00:04:41.520> what

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
mistaken for flying saucer that was what

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.620 
mistaken for flying saucer that was what
nailed<00:04:42.390> it<00:04:42.630> for<00:04:43.020> us<00:04:43.080> to<00:04:43.230> choose<00:04:43.410> the<00:04:43.620> DeLorean

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
nailed it for us to choose the DeLorean

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.120 
nailed it for us to choose the DeLorean
so<00:04:45.630> we're<00:04:46.050> getting<00:04:46.170> ready<00:04:46.350> to<00:04:46.530> make<00:04:46.650> the<00:04:46.830> movie
