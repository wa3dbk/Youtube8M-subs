00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:11.180
 Yes, the galloping This Well then 3 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:14.620
 Today, the fact that I want to show a video or rather how to slowly start the car 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:19.260
 About how to make such a slow start 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.260
 I would like to see you with everyone a little 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:27.939
 Ha ha ha 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.939
 I 'm traveling on my own car because it is slowly on Hashima slope 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.390
 You can go from a momentary pause 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.220
 Is it still moving 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.170
 It still works 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.490
 Though I think that together have to be slowly starting in this state is this is Chofu 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.060
 It is all right 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.060
 About 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:49.120
 I've now moving before knee 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.730
 It is moving 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.890
 I think that the number of rotations falls about 100 rotations of that bar 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.550
 Well if 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.550
 It is fine adjustment to the place of the platinum meet mechanism well 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:08.810
 Ugh danced 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:11.049
 But I think that I wonder if a little Well example confusing and this name is also not out of the sense of 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.049
 Also 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.850
 It is the situation that I roll slowly and bag 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.270
 I will do it slowly now 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:28.950
 If you're about to fall a little over 100 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:34.860
 There is also to say I'll rotate up a little in the accelerator minute 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:38.060
 Queue before so be increased rotational speed of the accelerator at the time of the um just meat gimmicks 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.060
 There is no pit 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.120
 Though it is around 2000 rotation now 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.330
 It's not out in front me so suddenly bread Nee 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:53.020
 I'm back slowly now 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:55.080
 When I'm Hermitian a version of anti-this Lecco asked to that regulation in about clutch 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.200
 slowly 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:02.620
 It is possible to move forward 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:05.340
 It's also possible to back slowly as well 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.340
 ThatLookLikeThis 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.599
 I'm going slowly now thinking this time 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:21.420
 I'm going slowly, I think it's about half a half a half 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:25.610
 Oh yes I feel like I'm feeling it if I get to practice at that special parking lot somewhere 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.610
 Also try to this slowly bag but I'm 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.350
 Taken because there is suffering chopper 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.500
 Though 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:39.270
 Travel is doing stamp to Honma that is slowly bag now 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.270
 I'll be down to something like this Tsu Gyu 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:51.150
 Hello 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.599
 By I 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.599
 Firmly car 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.420
 It is from a fan from now on half 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.220
 If you really get it, then you're going to go there. 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:16.560
 It is Hamura of Panpura I real intention another little accelerator 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:21.080
 It is okay to give fueled is not proceed before me that edition 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:24.220
 It's what I do even if Takeshi practice from between the semi-around 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.220
 It is like this 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:38.980
 It's all right if you give Axel a little bit more Papan 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:45.190
 Well just raise the accelerator a little for resupply to avoid the insurance or not to stop 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:49.010
 It is not know be Anoiru also work I mean and I'll open Toka 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:54.370
 What about Haa Here it is A' 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.370
 That's easy, but I would like to give it a try
