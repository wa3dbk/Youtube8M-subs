00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:08.440
 welcome to the channel today we are going to do 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:08.440
 an economical orange cake 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.710
 this cake is measured all in cups so 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.450
 it is important that they use the same 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.450
 cup to measure everything 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:39.430
 let's start by placing all the 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.430
 dry ingredients in a bowl 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.449
 I also call this cake cake 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.489
 wildcard since we can change it the 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.339
 grated orange zest 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.710
 lemon and grated coconut cubes 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:05.059
 Quince or whatever you want to 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.059
 vary this recipe 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.340
 The good thing about this recipe is that it 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.679
 ingredients that we all have at home 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.679
 therefore it does not imply higher expenses 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.020
 no longer 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.460
 As you can see, the recipe is super easy and 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.310
 fast and has no major procedures 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.920
 that mix the dry with the ingredients 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.580
 humid 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.580
 all right 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.270
 i 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.820
 It is important that while we are 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.430
 mixing the ingredients we are going to 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:56.270
 turn on the oven at maximum temperature 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:58.910
 then we put the broiler pan in the oven 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:01.390
 we're going to put it on minimum fire so that 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:03.569
 do not snatch the preparation 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.569
 i 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.920
 i 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.480
 and after the cake comes out of the oven 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.850
 let's grab a sheet and we're going to 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.170
 cut in this way with this that 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.320
 we're going to do is give it a special touch 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:40.110
 to our cake to have a delicious tea 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:44.090
 or a rich coffee or a rich mate with this 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.090
 so special and tasty preparation 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.260
 we put the paper on the cake and then 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.260
 let's sprinkle the impalpable sugar 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:04:58.980
 Y 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.650
