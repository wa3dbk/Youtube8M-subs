 the center of a lettuce then of 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:24.630
 this type of lettuce what you do is 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.099

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.410

 salads and we will also use 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.960
 half a liter of water you are going to boil 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.690
 the water when it has boiled then 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.290
 let's put some central sheets of 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.969
 the lettuce and also the trunk what 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.090
 we leave there that continues to boil 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.890
 five more minutes past this time you're going 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.250
 to go down to the fire and you will leave it 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.789
 rest for 10 minutes past the 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.010
 10 minutes we are going to strain this infusion and 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.480
 that's how our infusion is, you have to 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.820
 remember that the lettuce has 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.280
 properties with tranquilizing effect 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.549
 it helps us calm our nerves 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.830
 helps to make digestion controls the 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.460
 heartbeat and can help you 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.950
 how is our goal to sleep without 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.140
 interruptions caused by insomnia 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.170
 the trunk of the lettuce that is our 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.149
 main ingredient in this tea is 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.670
 formed by latex that contributes to 

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:29.729
 organism a tranquilizing substance and 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.140
 relaxing that is what will help us 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.420
 to sleep every night without 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.000
 interruptions but also this 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.850
 substance what it does is decrease the 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.520
 metabolism speed you have to 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.350
 be careful because this effect makes 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.780
 that in the body there is a 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.179
 feeling like relaxation but that a 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.520
 long term is going to be translated into a 

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:54.119
 increase in fluid retention in 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:57.420
 different areas of your body besides 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:59.280
 will present gas proliferation 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.789
 that will give us a feeling of bloating 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.830
 and discomfort is why you owe this 

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:07.350
 consume it from time to time when not 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.840
 you can sleep but if you see that the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.940
 insomnia is continuous recurrent 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.129
 It is better that you visit your doctor to 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.709
 let him see what is the treatment that 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.970
 must follow what are the causes of your 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.580
 insomnia 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.700
 this you can prepare it in the day and 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.879
 you can give it in a pot to take 20 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.280
 minutes before going to sleep 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:33.849
 you can go out to one or two cups of this 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.830
 tea and then you take only one at night 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.290
 and the rest you can save it for 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.959
 next night store it in the fridge 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.060
 but do not leave it for more than two days 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.640

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.530
