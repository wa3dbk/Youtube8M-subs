00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello guys how are you how much 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.069
 time after a week that I've 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.950
 been away from home and that's why I have not 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.090
 recorded quite less videos and 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.830
 many of you are asking me 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.410
 by social networks that pass to sergio 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.120
 you're alive, something has happened to you, 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.289
 I was dead I was just 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.289
 we started 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:25.009
 after a lot of rumors about 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:27.529
 to iPhone 6 it seems that we are finally going to 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.210
 see the apple light last week did 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:32.540
 official that next September 9 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.430
 he was going to celebrate his keynote and we were going to 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.469
 present little things we are going to analyze a 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.089
 little bit what we were going to present 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:40.190
 to Paul and above all we are going to talk 

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:42.079
 also from the place where you are going to celebrate 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.699
 this event because maybe it's the look 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.699
 more important 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:49.190
 flynn center we leave the yerba behind 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:51.620
 good center is going to celebrate the next 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.320
 apple keynote in print center a 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.229
 place where historically 30 years ago 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.540
 steve jobs introduced the first mac 

00:00:57.229 --> 00:01:01.460
 we have a new luxury scenario for 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.100
 true and remember that three months ago 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.320
 about eddie that one of the 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.009
 managers heavy weights of apple we 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.390
 he said that this year apple had the best 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:16.250
 launch schedule of the last 25 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.799
 years I think nobody has any doubt that 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.200
 this coming September 9 will be 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.700
 one of the most special dates for 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.370
 all the geeks and we have to mark 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.780
 from now on if you do not have it checked already 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:29.000
 in your calendars 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.400
 there has been talk about iphone 6 and all 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.100
 rumors of iphone l from live talk 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.869
 of the end of these two iphones that are going to 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.850
 leave how are they going to be going to 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.920
 have that will bring nfc that will bring 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.420
 more RAM you will ready the other many 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.369
 rumors about minds are completely 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.240
 false you do not have to believe everything 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.920
 what do they say 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.110
 but there are pretty reliable sources like 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.330
 the wall street journal with code al 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.670
 final that they are not interested in throwing a 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.810
 stone and in the end cheat the masses 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.330
 because they lose credibility themselves 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.350
 and as a means of information nobody 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.450
 can afford the luxury of losing 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.580
 credibility but guys let's talk 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.210
 a little bit of the event poster of 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.979
 Manzana 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.990
 the poster said something like I wish 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.220
 I could tell you something else 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.170
 I wish I could tell something more and I 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.120
 I would add the tagline but I can not 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:12.860
 because I already told you everything, not what 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.720
 true is that if we analyze a little bit 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.790
 this way money poster in the blog by 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.709
 example explained us of that framework of 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.290
 point net then at the end of that if you 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:24.110
 you fix the the corner of the apple has 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.290
 as a shadow it is as if the reflection of 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.959
 agreement will indicate that it is like a clock 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.190
 sun where the shadow gives you marks the 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.020
 I do not think that this is something 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.540
 pretty clear and the rumors 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.550
 so let's see a watt so 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.050
 could certainly be related by 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.740
 another side apple also put us the 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.020
 date 09/09/2011 and mehner released and in 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.780
 tweeter and said in the end that if you 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.850
 you come back to the date we have 26 26 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.260
 is that they could be in the end that we 

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.480
 they are going to take out 2 iphone 6 historically 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.830
 Paul is not much of putting dates in 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.110
 the posters that is that date 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.610
 I understand what you want to say something besides 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.070
 that is going to celebrate the event of that 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.240
 good day and what happens with ios 8 good 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.620
 Well there are about 8 we will see 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:08.600
 surely we will also see some 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.430
 surprise because some little thing has to 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.710
 have hidden for that new 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.390
 platform that will be the iwork if 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.040
 Also, if we are going to have a 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.500
 iphone with bigger screen I understand 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.870
 that some secret that is not yet 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.970
 we have seen is going to have this next year 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.890
 it's 8 we also talk to you in the sena cast 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.780
 of him and on the betas we did not tell you 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.700
 that has not come out in the last half 6 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.040
 we stayed in beta 5 of ios 8 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.230
 precisely because of this because maybe 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.780
 Apple does not want any leaks 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.970
 new function that is going to have to this 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.280
 year is final 8 then at the end for 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.490
 I revealed that he will have that iwatch that 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.200
 you will have the iPhone 6 or the like so 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.360
 that we have here a part of secrecy 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.970
 that what will surprise us enough 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.140
 boys girls is going to be a keynote 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:54.630
 incredible just having a little 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:57.110
 of patience, do not pay much attention to the 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.220
 rumors analyze them value them 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:01.140
 reflect them and then especially 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.960
 enjoy next because it will not 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:06.660
 to be surely the best keynote without 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:08.250
 doubt the last four years because 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.060
 we are going to surely have some 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.010
 products 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.600
 I hope that we will see fantastic 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.340
 what's up guys and this has been the 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.109
 video back after the 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.109
 I hope you do not have me on 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.640
 account my lack of activity I have to 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.959
 catch the filming still here nothing that 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.610
 you liked me you can support me with a 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.450
 I like it and see you in the 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.450
 next chao
