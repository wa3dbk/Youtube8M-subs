 I wonder if it makes sense to think personally a little bit 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.720
 It is air resistance with this screwing this much 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:02.880
 If it can be 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:05.840
 I will feel it 's such or not it a little difficult 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.840

 For example yeah 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:45.129
 And of paint 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.260
 It is an emblem 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:52.220

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:01.620

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:24.710
 It is recommended for those who want to ride a car together with 8 crews 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:26.750
 It 's pretty famous so it is heavy if you already know it 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:32.080
