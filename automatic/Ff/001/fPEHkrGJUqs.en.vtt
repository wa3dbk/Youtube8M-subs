going to mod this game boy advance um
there's<00:00:16.440> going<00:00:16.590> to<00:00:16.650> be<00:00:16.680> two<00:00:16.920> buttons<00:00:17.960> on<00:00:18.960> this

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
side over here one that'll turn it the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.140 
side over here one that'll turn it the
backlighting<00:00:22.740> dream<00:00:23.130> want<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.519> turn<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.970> red

backlighting dream want to turn it red

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.450 
backlighting dream want to turn it red
and<00:00:24.510> now<00:00:25.410> one<00:00:25.619> over<00:00:25.859> here<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.160> I'll<00:00:26.279> just

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
and now one over here that I'll just

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.210 
and now one over here that I'll just
backlight<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.119> I'm<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.439> use<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.859> led

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
backlight it I'm going to use this led

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.650 
backlight it I'm going to use this led
right<00:00:29.490> here<00:00:29.880> up<00:00:30.480> maybe<00:00:31.289> depends<00:00:32.189> on<00:00:32.600> what<00:00:33.600> kind

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
right here up maybe depends on what kind

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.799 
right here up maybe depends on what kind
of<00:00:33.980> if<00:00:34.980> these<00:00:35.250> are<00:00:35.430> surface<00:00:35.820> mount<00:00:36.030> LEDs<00:00:36.660> or

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
of if these are surface mount LEDs or

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.470 
of if these are surface mount LEDs or
what<00:00:37.020> but<00:00:37.800> others<00:00:38.100> an<00:00:38.250> LED<00:00:38.579> down<00:00:38.850> in<00:00:39.030> there<00:00:39.270> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
what but others an LED down in there and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.500 
what but others an LED down in there and
there's<00:00:40.230> one<00:00:40.469> right<00:00:40.590> there<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.980> all<00:00:41.129> change

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:41.510

be using LEDs for the screens and down

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:12.890 
be using LEDs for the screens and down
there<00:01:05.630> go<00:01:06.630> back<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.439> up<00:01:07.830> and<00:01:10.280> and<00:01:11.280> I<00:01:12.090> end

there go back like this up and and I end

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.969 
there go back like this up and and I end
up<00:01:14.720> just<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:16.020> don't<00:01:16.350> know<00:01:16.560> what<00:01:16.710> I'm<00:01:16.799> going<00:01:16.920> to

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
up just I don't know what I'm going to

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.570 
up just I don't know what I'm going to
do<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.670> sure<00:01:17.700> yet<00:01:18.119> but<00:01:18.409> what<00:01:19.409> basic<00:01:19.770> plans<00:01:20.250> are

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
switch right there for the backlighting

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.460 
switch right there for the backlighting
and<00:01:26.189> two<00:01:26.880> over<00:01:27.090> here<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.360> switch<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.110> from<00:01:28.200> red

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
here and maybe the one down there if i

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.130 
here and maybe the one down there if i
can<00:02:13.760> get<00:02:13.880> this<00:02:14.060> piece<00:02:14.330> right<00:02:14.360> here<00:02:14.600> off<00:02:14.930> the

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
can get this piece right here off the

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.310 
can get this piece right here off the
black<00:02:15.950> box<00:02:16.250> oh<00:02:16.720> and<00:02:17.720> they're<00:02:17.930> going<00:02:18.050> to<00:02:18.110> be<00:02:18.230> in

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
black box oh and they're going to be in

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.400 
black box oh and they're going to be in
there<00:02:18.500> but<00:02:18.980> uh<00:02:19.570> yeah<00:02:20.570> so<00:02:20.810> that's<00:02:20.960> what<00:02:21.110> was<00:02:21.260> my
