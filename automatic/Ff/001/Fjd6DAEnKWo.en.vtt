00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.450 
going to do is we're just going to pick
up<00:04:13.630> basic<00:04:14.020> pattern<00:04:14.440> so<00:04:15.040> we're<00:04:15.130> going<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.340> hit

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:15.460 
up basic pattern so we're going to hit

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.780 
up basic pattern so we're going to hit
this<00:04:15.610> chord<00:04:16.050> go<00:04:17.050> to<00:04:17.110> G<00:04:17.500> bar<00:04:18.160> chord<00:04:18.489> so<00:04:18.640> that's

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
this chord go to G bar chord so that's

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.470 
this chord go to G bar chord so that's
three<00:04:19.270> five<00:04:19.690> five<00:04:20.280> four<00:04:21.280> and<00:04:21.610> then<00:04:22.090> move<00:04:22.450> that

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:22.480 
three five five four and then move that

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:24.030 
three five five four and then move that
up<00:04:22.810> a<00:04:22.930> whole<00:04:23.110> step<00:04:23.350> so<00:04:23.470> it's<00:04:23.590> going<00:04:23.680> to<00:04:23.740> be<00:04:23.830> five

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.040 
up a whole step so it's going to be five

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:32.230 
up a whole step so it's going to be five
seven<00:04:24.520> seven<00:04:24.640> six<00:04:25.060> so<00:04:25.390> we<00:04:25.510> got

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:54.420 

I'm<00:04:33.240> just<00:04:33.480> going

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.310 

you<00:04:55.030> can<00:04:55.180> throw<00:04:55.419> a<00:04:55.449> cool<00:04:55.690> little<00:04:55.960> riffs<00:04:56.139> in

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:56.320 
you can throw a cool little riffs in

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:02.120 
you can throw a cool little riffs in
there<00:04:56.440> so<00:04:56.590> we<00:04:56.680> can<00:04:56.800> be<00:04:56.860> like

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:08.749 

that's

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:16.130 

right<00:05:09.719> so<00:05:10.199> we<00:05:10.259> go

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:18.500 

that's<00:05:16.860> just<00:05:17.100> that

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:18.510

does<00:05:28.060> it<00:05:28.210> uh<00:05:28.240> three<00:05:29.050> times<00:05:29.290> up

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.760 

and<00:05:44.510> then<00:05:45.020> now<00:05:45.170> you're<00:05:45.290> going<00:05:45.410> to<00:05:45.470> go<00:05:45.560> to<00:05:45.620> an

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
and then now you're going to go to an

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.030 
and then now you're going to go to an
octave<00:05:46.130> apart<00:05:46.220> which<00:05:46.550> is<00:05:46.580> starts<00:05:47.420> on<00:05:47.540> the<00:05:47.630> nine

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:48.040 
octave apart which is starts on the nine

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:52.060 
octave apart which is starts on the nine
seven<00:05:49.040> five<00:05:49.220> bits<00:05:50.470> and<00:05:51.470> you're<00:05:51.590> gonna<00:05:51.680> do<00:05:51.890> that

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
seven five bits and you're gonna do that

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.350 
seven five bits and you're gonna do that
part<00:05:52.490> like<00:05:52.610> you<00:05:52.760> started<00:05:53.030> out<00:05:53.090> from<00:05:53.180> the

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
part like you started out from the

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.490 
part like you started out from the
beginning<00:05:55.720> I'm<00:05:56.720> just<00:05:56.840> gonna<00:05:56.930> do<00:05:57.080> it<00:05:57.110> twice<00:05:57.260> you

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
beginning I'm just gonna do it twice you

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.460 
beginning I'm just gonna do it twice you
got

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:28.310 

right<00:06:02.470> you<00:06:02.590> can<00:06:02.710> bend<00:06:02.890> it<00:06:02.980> up

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:38.810 

that<00:06:28.500> brings<00:06:28.680> us<00:06:28.830> into<00:06:29.010> the<00:06:29.190> lead<00:06:30.170> twice<00:06:37.820> so

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:38.820 
that brings us into the lead twice so

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.820 
that brings us into the lead twice so
that's<00:06:39.030> slide<00:06:39.750> from<00:06:40.050> the<00:06:40.230> 9th<00:06:41.010> to<00:06:41.370> the<00:06:41.580> 11th

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:42.830 
that's slide from the 9th to the 11th

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:46.430 
that's slide from the 9th to the 11th
and<00:06:43.830> you're<00:06:44.730> gonna<00:06:44.820> hit<00:06:45.000> the<00:06:45.240> ninth<00:06:45.570> fret<00:06:46.230> on

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:46.440 
and you're gonna hit the ninth fret on

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:55.340 
and you're gonna hit the ninth fret on
the<00:06:46.500> G<00:06:46.830> bend<00:06:47.640> up<00:06:47.820> the<00:06:47.970> 12th<00:06:48.330> fret<00:06:48.450> on<00:06:48.540> the<00:06:48.630> B<00:06:54.350> so

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:55.350 
the G bend up the 12th fret on the B so

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:56.420 
the G bend up the 12th fret on the B so
you're<00:06:55.440> going<00:06:55.560> to<00:06:55.590> slide<00:06:55.800> from<00:06:55.950> the<00:06:56.040> 12th<00:06:56.400> to

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:56.430 
you're going to slide from the 12th to

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:01.070 
you're going to slide from the 12th to
the<00:06:56.550> 14th<00:06:57.060> on<00:06:57.510> the<00:06:58.050> D<00:06:58.260> 12<00:06:58.890> on<00:06:59.190> the<00:06:59.370> G<00:06:59.930> 15th<00:07:00.930> you

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
the 14th on the D 12 on the G 15th you

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:03.980 
the 14th on the D 12 on the G 15th you
don't<00:07:01.290> bend<00:07:01.590> it<00:07:01.740> just<00:07:02.510> take<00:07:03.510> the<00:07:03.630> heck<00:07:03.780> out<00:07:03.960> of

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:03.990 
don't bend it just take the heck out of

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:09.940 
don't bend it just take the heck out of
it<00:07:07.310> that<00:07:08.310> brings<00:07:08.580> us<00:07:08.700> into<00:07:08.850> the<00:07:09.000> solo<00:07:09.390> part

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:09.950 
it that brings us into the solo part

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:22.690 
it that brings us into the solo part
during<00:07:10.950> the<00:07:11.160> solo<00:07:11.570> yeah

00:07:22.690 --> 00:07:22.700 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.480 

since<00:07:23.700> that<00:07:23.850> same<00:07:24.090> chord<00:07:25.220> but<00:07:26.220> then<00:07:26.370> you're

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:26.490 
since that same chord but then you're

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.530 
since that same chord but then you're
going<00:07:26.700> to<00:07:26.820> the<00:07:26.910> ninth<00:07:27.150> octave<00:07:28.160> it's<00:07:29.160> 911<00:07:29.540> and

00:07:30.530 --> 00:07:30.540 
going to the ninth octave it's 911 and

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:38.030 
going to the ninth octave it's 911 and
then<00:07:30.750> to<00:07:30.870> the<00:07:30.960> D<00:07:35.840> very<00:07:36.840> very<00:07:37.260> very<00:07:37.620> cool

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:38.040 
then to the D very very very cool

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:41.720 
then to the D very very very cool
progression<00:07:39.000> to<00:07:39.090> us<00:07:39.180> all<00:07:39.330> over
