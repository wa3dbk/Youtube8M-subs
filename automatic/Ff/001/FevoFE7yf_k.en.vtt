00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 
is a little bit difficult because you

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:15.430 
is a little bit difficult because you
don't<00:06:14.390> know<00:06:14.479> where<00:06:14.630> you're<00:06:14.750> at<00:06:14.900> especially<00:06:15.380> if

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:15.440

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
any big cards come out but you always

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:19.210 
any big cards come out but you always
want<00:06:17.720> to<00:06:17.750> keep<00:06:17.870> the<00:06:18.020> pot<00:06:18.200> small<00:06:18.530> it's<00:06:18.890> a<00:06:19.010> little

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
want to keep the pot small it's a little

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.170 
want to keep the pot small it's a little
bit<00:06:19.340> different<00:06:19.640> so<00:06:19.760> now<00:06:19.880> that<00:06:20.030> we're<00:06:20.150> three

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:20.180 
bit different so now that we're three

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.350 
bit different so now that we're three
handed<00:06:20.660> you<00:06:20.720> want<00:06:20.870> to<00:06:20.930> be<00:06:21.020> aggressive<00:06:22.360> well

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
that can really hurt him exactly if he

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.320 
that can really hurt him exactly if he
calls<00:06:30.470> here<00:06:30.890> what's<00:06:31.790> he<00:06:31.880> gonna<00:06:31.940> do<00:06:32.150> on<00:06:32.270> the
