00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:13.450
 Madrid is always favorite not always 

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:16.540
 when they play any championship the 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.080
 always favorite but I think for 

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:21.880
 win the championship we do not have to be 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.770
 a little bit of aspirants we do not 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:29.080
 we think about defeat we are working 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.410
 strong so you do not have to soon 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.699
 the terrace and we must continue as well as 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.550
 we are doing that is cristian 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:39.250
 throwing really good I 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.630
 with this with this team I'm not going to death 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.060
 and I'm training 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.750
 strong every day playing current 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:52.620
 to to continue like this not playing and giving 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:56.780
 the possibility of wisteria help them 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.730
 my classmates he has many things 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.660
 I want to win more titles here 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.630
 I want to win the champions but the team 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.290
 for many many years I want to get to 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.110
 selection too but good is very much 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.860
 and I have to be working hard to 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.860
 to obtain 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.820
 that is what is expected 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:26.190
 I think if the athletic 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.400
 it's a good team and we now 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.400
 we're 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.030
 and we improve a lot in making goals and everything 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.110
 that and well I hope that who gets more 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.930
 goals and they do not 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.560
 laurent is played with a few times 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.470
 and it is very very difficult 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.700
 stop but I think the defense of 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.710
 Madrid 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.320
 is very good and we are doing a great 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.630
 work I do not know I think who does 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.079
 difficult to match ourselves 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.420
 well we are working for that and 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.780
 I hope you get the help the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.780
 guitar 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.970
 it's difficult but I think everything can 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:17.300
 happen 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:17.300
 and we do our thing here what happens 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.870
 good that has a lot of quality I think 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.410
 both have a lot of quality and very much 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:30.400
 from there of 22 or 33 I think it could be 

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.400
 with many goals
