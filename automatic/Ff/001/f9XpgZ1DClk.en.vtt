00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.379
 we were at the inauguration of the 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:14.820
 advocacy of the partner and we had the 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.400
 opportunity to talk to José Luís 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.079
 acevedo its responsible good me 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.539
 would like to know how the idea of the 

00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:23.220
 Defender partner here in river by 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.810
 that never loved own 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.719
 the truth that the idea is born of a 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.219
 President's proposal to act on a 

00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:32.430
 man who raised it where all his 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:34.200
 campaign and good is born there as a place 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.840
 that partners can present their 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.000
 complaints their claims of complaints and 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.010
 also why not his proposals towards 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.530
 a place listens to a place of defense of 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.320
 partner of the activities in which 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.850
 they do not agree they do not feel 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.340
 injured in their statutory rights 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.380
 that's where we're going to activate us or 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.800
 it is open to the voice of everyone 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.790
 partner that needs something or complains or what 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.100
 that is as for the club 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:01.649
 we have no reference of other 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.690
 institutions except barcelona and I think that 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.700
 another club in europe is the first 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.110
 Latin America that carries out these 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.530
 a policy advocacy club 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.780
 members of a sports club but it's going to 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.760
 be open to all the demand after 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.030
 we will cut and see how 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.710
 but above all to any violation of 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.570
 the statutory rights of the partner there 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.730
 we activate in us when 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.070
 we made the composition that we made 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:31.860
 first of most people who are 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.630
 They are partners who live with my children. 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.360
 they know like the palm of the hand the club 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.660
 why because they grew up are guys from 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.090
 river are son are from club are they were brought up 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.920
 here and most of those that integrate that 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.750
 they have my age that make up the commission 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.340
 of advocacy of the space partner 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.020
 exactly the same thing we know the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.640
 club and the younger ones that also 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.890
 many young people in this commission 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.930
 they also know him because dads to his 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.130
 Once they had when they were kids this 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.320
 it was a designation that I the president 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.240
 I think two months ago to me and as not 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.700
 there was nothing because there was not even a 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.290
 protocol neither had a project nor had 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.959
 a program had not absolutely had 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.180
 founding from nothing I repeat you there is no 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.860
 no advocacy from the partner and no 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.270
 Latin America club in this as a 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.280
 charro I feel proud to be able 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.540
 preside over an institution that does not have 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.459
 background 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.750
 I have to start working from scratch what 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.629
 what we did with the president every 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.730
 so much we asked for a query and good 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:29.299
 we made a project we presented him what 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.620
 approved it improved and today we are 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.900
 doing this presentation in society 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.760
 of what the defense before all the 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.129
 partners of river we did not want is an act 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.650
 but what we did is like 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.420
 invites the press to invite the people of the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.310
 board of directors welcome 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.200
 this new institution that we 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.879
 we think that the 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.549
 time the advocacy doors 

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:53.129
 they start to work from more than 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.260
 next there is in the hall the narrow part 

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:57.359
 da just trains club to his right 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.000
 week then account both plotted the 

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:02.579
 advocacy from 5:00 pm 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.780
 until 20 and I think on Saturdays 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.329
 tomorrow we will finish solving 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.189

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.569
 late many thanks 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.280
 no thanks to you for giving us the 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:13.260
 opportunity to transmit with 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.819
 this enthusiasm is the truth 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.590
 as a river fan anything that 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.090
 let's do on the river is good because we 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.540
