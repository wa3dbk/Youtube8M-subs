00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
here so this is pretty much the end to

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.140 
here so this is pretty much the end to
the<00:05:19.800> game<00:05:20.010> they<00:05:20.460> do<00:05:20.520> go<00:05:21.000> and<00:05:21.120> get<00:05:21.360> baron<00:05:21.990> and

the game they do go and get baron and
afterwards<00:05:24.150> after<00:05:24.510> they<00:05:24.630> get<00:05:24.810> baron<00:05:25.590> they<00:05:26.400> are

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
afterwards after they get baron they are

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.280 
afterwards after they get baron they are
pushing<00:05:26.820> in<00:05:27.090> here<00:05:27.120> i<00:05:27.480> think<00:05:27.690> you'll<00:05:27.960> see<00:05:28.140> it<00:05:28.200> in
