00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
cheek so what I like to do is fold up a

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.109 
cheek so what I like to do is fold up a
little<00:01:54.810> piece<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.049> paper<00:01:55.290> towel<00:01:55.729> or<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:57.030> napkin

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
little piece of paper towel or a napkin

little piece of paper towel or a napkin
like<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.930> and<00:01:58.229> then<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:58.770> just<00:01:58.860> bite<00:01:59.250> down<00:01:59.280> on

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
like that and then I just bite down on

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.490 
like that and then I just bite down on
top<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.360> because<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:01.049> know<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.320> tooth

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
top of it because you know the tooth

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.969 
top of it because you know the tooth
ache<00:02:01.710> I<00:02:01.890> had<00:02:02.100> was<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.090> top<00:02:03.450> surface<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.649> I'd

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
ache I had was on the top surface so I'd

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.590 
ache I had was on the top surface so I'd
put<00:02:05.219> my<00:02:05.340> drops<00:02:05.700> in<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.210> then<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.420> would<00:02:06.570> just

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
put my drops in and then I would just

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.359 
put my drops in and then I would just
bite<00:02:06.869> down<00:02:06.899> on<00:02:07.110> this<00:02:07.439> for<00:02:07.680> like<00:02:07.799> two<00:02:08.009> minutes

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
bite down on this for like two minutes

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.550 
bite down on this for like two minutes
and<00:02:08.550> that<00:02:09.119> would<00:02:09.239> that<00:02:09.840> would<00:02:09.959> be<00:02:10.080> it<00:02:10.229> you're

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
and that would that would be it you're

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.330 
and that would that would be it you're
good<00:02:10.770> for<00:02:11.039> six<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.489> eight<00:02:11.580> hours

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
good for six to eight hours

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.430 
good for six to eight hours
and<00:02:13.410> what<00:02:14.410> you<00:02:14.500> do<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.890> then<00:02:15.430> put<00:02:16.060> your

and what you do is then put your

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.170 
and what you do is then put your
toothpick<00:02:17.440> back<00:02:17.680> inside<00:02:18.099> the<00:02:18.280> pill<00:02:18.489> and

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
toothpick back inside the pill and

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.479 
toothpick back inside the pill and
that's<00:02:20.140> your<00:02:20.319> cap<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.770> that'll<00:02:21.040> just<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.370> can

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.520 
that's your cap and that'll just you can
reuse<00:02:21.849> that<00:02:21.880> pill<00:02:22.330> five<00:02:22.660> six<00:02:23.050> more<00:02:23.230> times

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
reuse that pill five six more times

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.190 
reuse that pill five six more times
maybe<00:02:24.250> more<00:02:24.400> depending<00:02:24.790> on<00:02:25.239> how<00:02:25.750> many<00:02:25.810> drips

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
maybe more depending on how many drips

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.960 
maybe more depending on how many drips
you<00:02:26.470> can<00:02:26.770> see<00:02:26.950> little<00:02:27.130> air<00:02:27.310> bubbles<00:02:27.670> in<00:02:27.819> there

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
you can see little air bubbles in there

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.479 
you can see little air bubbles in there
there's<00:02:28.180> my<00:02:28.330> two<00:02:28.390> drips<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:30.130> that<00:02:30.280> pill<00:02:30.459> is

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
there's my two drips so that pill is

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.220 
there's my two drips so that pill is
going<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.730> keep<00:02:30.910> on<00:02:31.090> giving<00:02:31.330> over<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:31.989> over

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
going to keep on giving over and over

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.800 
going to keep on giving over and over
again<00:02:32.319> and<00:02:33.280> it<00:02:33.640> will<00:02:33.760> leak<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.239> little<00:02:34.540> bit<00:02:34.690> if

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
again and it will leak a little bit if

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.940 
again and it will leak a little bit if
you<00:02:34.840> don't<00:02:35.080> get<00:02:35.200> it<00:02:35.349> in<00:02:35.440> there<00:02:35.560> nice<00:02:35.709> and<00:02:35.739> tight

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
you don't get it in there nice and tight

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.759 
you don't get it in there nice and tight
so<00:02:36.340> be<00:02:36.459> careful<00:02:36.849> but<00:02:37.660> this<00:02:38.080> is<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.410> best

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:38.769 
so be careful but this is the best

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:41.130 
so be careful but this is the best
solution<00:02:39.010> for<00:02:39.670> a<00:02:39.700> toothache<00:02:40.150> I've<00:02:40.420> ever<00:02:40.810> seen

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
solution for a toothache I've ever seen

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.830 
solution for a toothache I've ever seen
I've<00:02:41.530> never<00:02:41.860> seen<00:02:42.370> it<00:02:42.519> done<00:02:42.640> on<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.480> Internet

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
I've never seen it done on the Internet

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:45.570 
I've never seen it done on the Internet
I<00:02:43.959> made<00:02:44.260> this<00:02:44.380> one<00:02:44.560> up<00:02:44.680> all<00:02:44.860> by<00:02:45.010> myself

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
I made this one up all by myself

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.850 
I made this one up all by myself
when<00:02:46.510> advil<00:02:46.900> gets<00:02:47.140> ahold<00:02:47.380> of<00:02:47.500> it<00:02:47.620> they'll

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
when advil gets ahold of it they'll

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.990 
when advil gets ahold of it they'll
probably<00:02:48.069> come<00:02:48.340> out<00:02:48.489> with<00:02:48.610> some<00:02:48.760> kind<00:02:48.970> of

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
probably come out with some kind of

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.789 
probably come out with some kind of
little<00:02:49.209> squeeze<00:02:49.540> tube<00:02:49.870> product<00:02:50.410> and<00:02:50.620> make<00:02:50.769> a
