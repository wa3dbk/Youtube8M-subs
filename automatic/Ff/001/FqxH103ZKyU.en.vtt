00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.230
 hello welcome to a new video where 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.769
 let's find a division of numbers 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.360
 decimals with integer divisor 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.369
 they are made just like the divisions 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.230
 whole but when we go down the first 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.079
 number behind the comma that separates the 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.310
 whole part the decimal in the dividend 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:26.910
 we will also lower a comma in the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.750
 quotient let's see some example we want 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.310
 divide 120 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.420
 8.32 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:39.620
 between 3 and we want to approximate such 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.620
 to thousandths 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.780
 so we do division 128 as 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:55.719
 32 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:59.800
 from 3 3 x 4 12-12 0 under 83 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:01.539
 26 to 82 as now under the 3 what is it 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.399
 that goes behind the coma under here 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:10.810
 also the comma 7 by 3 21 to 23 2 low 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:12.460
 the 2 7 by 3 21 to 22 1 and we're going to 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.500
 the hundredths as it is full thousandths 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.640
 we have another one and we do not have more figures 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.740
 so we go down 0 3 by 3 9 to 10 and 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:27.960
 as we have it in the thousandths we stop 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:27.960
 the result will be 40 and 2,773 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.700
 we see another example 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:38.640
 2436 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.640
 58 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.200
 / 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.200
 and we want to also approximate 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.200
 thousandths 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:06.750
 so we put them 2,436 as 58 between 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:12.980
 15 15 for 1 to 15 to 29 to 24 9 under 3 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:17.580
 6 x 15 are 90 93 under 3 and under 6 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.610
 15 for 2 30 36 6 under 5 as this one already 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:24.540
 is behind the coma we also go down 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:31.140
 the comma in the quotient 15 by 4 are 60 to 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:33.560
 65 5 and under 83 by 15 45 up to 58 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.560
 They are 13 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:41.180
 and as it still lacks one we go down a 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:44.120
 zero and we already have that 8 by 15 are 120 to 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.650
 130 are 10 already we have it approximated to 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:52.030
 the thousandths with which we stopped 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:54.160
 our results 160 and 2,438 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.750
 this is all for the moment we see each other in 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.819
 the next video I recommend you
