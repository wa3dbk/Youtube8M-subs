 panel of your computer naturally 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.220

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.180
 It is necessary that this wire with the inscription 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.510

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.800
 Now I will open a video with music and 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.709
 demonstrate that no sound like 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.630

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.709
 headphones and how do you hear now 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.390
 no sound here, respectively 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.330
 Now I will tell you what to do for 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.440
 so that the sound appears so go in 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.130
 settings 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:56.500
 realtek hd here we go with them and 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.920
 accordingly, you need to continue 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:02.140
 will click out of all these different ones here 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.970
 buttons on this completely inconspicuous 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.120
 yellow daddy upstairs 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.720
 is it not absolutely clear and 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.049
 next tick off 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.840
 front panel socket detection 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.320
 There is an idea here it is necessary to include 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.390
 defining me from the front panel and 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.980
 accordingly illogical but still you 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:29.549
 will need to put it here 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:32.829
 tick press ok and how you hear the sound 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.060
 which headphones are connected to me 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.299
 front panel 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.780
 coming and we can enjoy the sound and 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:43.630
 picture and accordingly and so hopefully 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.440
 the video was useful to you personally, I myself am not 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.440
