00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:06.920
 Greetings l km Viewers Hello Soccer player Kim Soo-hyun 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.059
 Ah Won 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.960
 Explanation of situation 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:27.079
 Once bets are down on the end of the game that there is in fact remain in my memory that 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:33.739
 Remember to check the scene section yet. Oh, I tell you the old target what you think 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:37.820
 With the transition of medicine now about to go out in May now cross-jade 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:41.000
 I am a timetable, and I came and I had one, 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:43.860
 I raised watching 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.650
 You'll be in good health when you look good. 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:54.960
 I put my cross on my own. 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:58.590
 I have a training session for you. 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:02.650
 I was committed to rehabilitation because of my ups . 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:08.770
 There are a lot of people who think this is going to happen so suddenly today. 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:13.000
 Ah, I'm just a girl , 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:19.180
 Because I got the goods for the last match, 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:26.890
 So if you go into the game, you want to be in Japan. 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:29.080
 I thought I 'd finished my policy . But I got 45 minutes to go in the second half. 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.920
 I think that hard work is not it 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:38.020
 Oh, tell me one myself oh 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.970
 It's just a little bit of a real-time search. 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.000
 Do you know that again 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:48.120
 Do not eat that rice 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.120
 It was the first time I heard it. 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.160
 And 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.770
 I'd like to talk about the position for a while. Originally until last year, 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:02:01.390
 It was not black and white on the right. Yeah. 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:05.400
 Playing magic carp , but suddenly 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:10.590
 I 've been calling Min to call now. 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.550
 It 's like you're on your team. 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.770
 I think it is. 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:20.300
 Yes 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:23.300
 Anyway, my team is playing together, so I talk to each other. 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.450
 I'm fine example happened 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:30.050
 UB is also heard best just leave this 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:33.800
 I guess I should have listened so well and tried to do this . 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:39.350
 And if it's the same place I do 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:41.120
 Teng thing to change was the first night in his team last year, is now the first team picked what 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:46.280
 It's 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.970
 In Daegu , when I was a member of the stadium, 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:54.200
 I'm a little older now 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.970
 Then I thought that I would have to go back to Ashville. 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:00.180
 I think I fell out of sight. 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:05.220
 You are now three letters of long Suwon 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:08.700
 Now it dwaetneunde the yain instruments of nationals of the Republic of Korea show any play in the future 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:15.750
 Finally simply I did not want to highs just like 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:16.470
 One more thing, I would not be going to vary my full name to tell what jyeotdago 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:23.280
 It's the same. 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:31.790
 Well before this one place that a lot of technology to extract or athletes, rather than trying to be a boon to the team 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:34.960
 I'm trying something that he was sacrificing that could pinch a bit of the team dedicated 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:39.150
 I'm trying to bring a lot 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.150
 Thank you because of the interviews have come from 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.720
