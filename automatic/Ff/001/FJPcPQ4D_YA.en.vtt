00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:12.490 
precisely but i don't think this device

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:14.460 
precisely but i don't think this device
actually<00:04:12.790> could<00:04:13.150> be<00:04:13.180> used<00:04:13.480> as<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:13.960> current

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.950 

here<00:04:23.010> I'm<00:04:23.280> just<00:04:23.340> trying<00:04:23.910> to<00:04:24.090> show<00:04:24.270> that<00:04:24.300> the

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:24.960 
here I'm just trying to show that the

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.000 
here I'm just trying to show that the
device<00:04:25.229> is<00:04:25.740> fast<00:04:26.340> indeed<00:04:26.699> I<00:04:27.300> think<00:04:28.110> it's<00:04:28.320> quite

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
device is fast indeed I think it's quite

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.030 
device is fast indeed I think it's quite
sufficient<00:04:29.580> for<00:04:30.080> any<00:04:31.080> typical<00:04:31.260> user<00:04:31.620> like

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:32.040 
sufficient for any typical user like

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:38.010 
sufficient for any typical user like
myself

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.480 

and<00:04:38.110> you<00:04:38.740> see<00:04:38.949> here<00:04:39.310> is<00:04:39.340> a<00:04:39.940> sidebar<00:04:41.160> left<00:04:42.160> hand

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
and you see here is a sidebar left hand

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.059 
and you see here is a sidebar left hand
side<00:04:42.849> it<00:04:43.150> could<00:04:43.509> actually<00:04:43.750> be<00:04:44.050> disabled<00:04:44.620> but

00:04:45.059 --> 00:04:45.069 
side it could actually be disabled but

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:47.610 
side it could actually be disabled but
for<00:04:45.430> some<00:04:45.580> people<00:04:45.729> I<00:04:46.120> believe<00:04:46.629> it<00:04:46.930> could<00:04:47.319> come

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
for some people I believe it could come

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.340 
for some people I believe it could come
in<00:04:47.650> handy

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.580 

as<00:04:50.410> you<00:04:51.340> probably<00:04:51.580> understand<00:04:52.320> the<00:04:53.320> device

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
as you probably understand the device

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:56.460 
as you probably understand the device
wasn't<00:04:53.890> used<00:04:54.280> for<00:04:55.270> any<00:04:55.420> prolonged<00:04:55.810> period<00:04:56.380> of

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:56.470 
wasn't used for any prolonged period of

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:59.580 
wasn't used for any prolonged period of
time<00:04:56.680> so<00:04:56.980> i<00:04:57.010> have<00:04:57.340> no<00:04:57.520> comments<00:04:58.000> on<00:04:58.590> its

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
time so i have no comments on its

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
time so i have no comments on its
durability<00:05:00.070> on<00:05:00.850> this<00:05:01.300> green<00:05:01.950> glass<00:05:02.950> quality
