00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 today we have you talking about the 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.049
 market of 250 300 cm cube in full 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:09.210
 vogue at the moment with the return 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.429
 many builders including 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.160
 Japanese on this niche because of the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.199
 globalization of the bike at the level 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.510
 international so we're dealing with 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:23.850
 productions so there a suzuki did 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:27.150
 zuma 250 roadster style a 250 crf 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.369
 honda tribe the return of the trail of 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.149
 average displacement and the sporty with the 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.700
 kawasaki 300 ninja twin also 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:39.030
 and so a very sporty connotation 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.370
 will offer you a small comparison of 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:45.260
 this category with so three 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.260
 different typologies en route 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.640
 m 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.119
 it is then the blood and connects the pot 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.100
 exhaust 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.659
 brad here a characteristic noise of the 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.520
 vertical twin 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.320
 after this first more contrary 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.090
 everything turns out that what he shows very 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.649
 balanced what we appreciate our 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.479
 clothes to brew the vine immediately 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:28.880
 his little motor and recovery are 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.009
 excellent for for in 250 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.310
 of course and especially beat the German 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.310
 man show 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.330
 m 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:03.640
 this is my 

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.850
 in 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.709
 for an entry-level motorcycle 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.569
 lina zuma 250 and surprising of approval 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.430
 we forget willingly its cubic capacity thanks 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:29.170
 its exciting motor behavior 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.909
 and we enjoy his playful character 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.980
 and its fun cycle part 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.629
 despite an important point rigging his 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.019
 accelerations and its performance in 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.489
 side 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.010
 lina zuma offers good sensations 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.870
 and a nice balance she puts in range of 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:44.069
 purse of simple pleasure but it's more 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.069
 a basic roadster case 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.440
 dynamic because we really have a 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.010
 engine that is filled relatively 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.030
 nervous 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.520
 certainly quite linear but really 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.110
 pleasant to drive 

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:27.350
 it's a flexibility 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.350
 late 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:15.480
 thanks to these enduro genes the one that is 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.100
 a very good bike in town does not balk 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.260
 not to offer much more when we dare 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.670
 left the bitumen she then expresses her 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.710
 full potential and allows to discover 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.300
 gently the joys of all terrain and 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:27.420
 to progress in the measure of what 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.220
 allows its engine the honda crf 250 is 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.690
 a civilized motorcycle and well under all 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.210
 reports that we appreciated for its 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:36.230
 sobriety and its excellent engine in addition 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.230
 it's not the most expensive 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:06.410
 once upon a time the ninja kawasaki 250 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.720
 frog beds that wanted to be done 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:12.170
 as big as the hyper sports 1.3 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.570
 cubic centimeter beneficial to the 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:17.990
 new version of this sports micro 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:21.610
 the two-cylinder and the valiant ones yes the 

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:21.610
 islands and rage he says 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.990
 the 300 succeeds the 250 ninja with 

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:35.300
 happiness and finally shows up very 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.880
 Versatile for a sporty a jig 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.620
 generous a position not exclusive and 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.400
 a flexible and unctuous engine very 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.400
 discreet exhaust 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:06:11.560
 in town the ninja is not worth it 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.380
 with a soft box and agility 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.090
 certain but she has two faces 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:18.190
 as soon as the road gets wider the 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:20.260
 engine go wild from 9 to 13 thousand 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.330
 towers and the frame su wonderfully and 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:24.330
 does not usurp his ninja appellation 

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.919
 honda and kawasaki proves that we 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.990
 can combine everyday urban use and 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:42.970
 the pleasures of the weekend on the road for 

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:45.280
 the ninja or any terrain for the crf 

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:47.139
 suzuki offers an alternative to 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.090
 basic productions with an engine 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.550
 alert but as much the other two are 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:53.770
 light as suzuki to 30 kilos of 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:55.810
 too much is also the least expensive of the lot 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.970
 and she will be a remarkable steed of the 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.500
 everyday but maybe that's the style 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:02.350
 or the positioning that will make the 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.010
 difference for you basic trails or 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:05.050
 sports 

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:06.940
 you are rather what unless this 

00:07:05.050 --> 00:07:08.800
 the price of the suzuki the least 

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.960
 dear who carry it or its ease 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:12.789
 for the duo the other two are more 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.370
 exclusive is designed for driving 

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:15.850
 solo we hope to have facilitated your 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.560
 choice 

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:19.150
 but if we were to retain only one 

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:20.800
 model that would be the honda 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:24.150
 because it's the most versatile and the most 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.150
 easy on all possible terrains 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.340
 m 

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:30.970
