00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.600
 i 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.079
 for the mask and for the ears what 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.050
 I did was use a mask that 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.180
 I had previously and so I turned it into 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.340
 You can find a template in my 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.710
 twitter account 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.770
 and the only thing I'm doing is tracing 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:59.130
 the on a black felt cloth both 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.320
 more expensive like the ears the mask and the 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.530
 cut as you may have seen and for the 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:07.140
 band that will go around the head 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.290
 and I'm using the same fabric and I'm 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.810
 cutting a length of 35 centimeters but 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.360
 Well, if you want, you can use a 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.220
 elastic if they use an elastic instead of 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.290
 I recommend the fabric 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.390
 only half that I think are 15 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.790
 centimeters and I'm making a mark 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.530
 with a company where he ended up in 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.430
 my head because I have to measure it before 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.340
 sewing and once and for medi 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.899
 I'm sewing with a needle and with a 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.899
 black thread as you can see it 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:46.540
 the ears are two as is the template 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:51.310
 in the black cloth two false ears on 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:53.740
 he some cartons a thick paper I do not know 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.630
 what you want is for the 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.380
 time to put on the headband 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.660
 ears well I do not know how to shut up and good yes and 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.420
 as you can see they are in themselves are four of 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.150
 black color and two cardboard what am I 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.640
 doing is that with a very basic 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.160
 of the ears have to be bigger 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.840
 than the other so that I can 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.720
 know them around the headband like 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.150
 can see and once I finish 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.870
 I turned them around and I'm measuring 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:27.100
 I'm sorry I'm poking my ear 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.440
 fake cardboard inside to be able to sew 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.950
 as you can see or is the only thing I did 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.350
 I finished sewing I turned it 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.470
 I put inside the ear of cardboard 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.450
 false glory and then I'm measuring is not 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.100
 necessary that you stay accurate is to say 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.170
 the fake cardboard ear is always going to 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.820
 be a little bigger than the one 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.560
 we are doing because when we turn it 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.500
 as you reduce the size a little bit 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:53.200
 so you just have to cut and 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.390
 here I am measuring more or less the 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.120
 distance that I want from between ear to 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:01.209
 ear but this is optional to solve 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.340
 just something to be able to guide and ready 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.980
 we already have the view and we already have the 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.379
 mask now for makeup 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:13.760
 what I did as always apply a 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:17.659
 makeup foundation on my face and 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.780
 for the eyes with a shadow a little bit 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:23.239
 gray and paint my eyebrows a bit so that 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.430
 resemble that of anne hathaway what 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:29.090
 I'm using is a mixed palette in the 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:32.260
 good environment in rhapsody and I'm using 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.569
 first a white tone for the whole eye 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:39.410
 a brown tone for the eye socket and 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.959
 the black tone for the corners good 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.730
 clear for the right corner our 

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:46.090
 left of the eye as you can see the 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:50.190
 video 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.190
 and we are not going to finish and blur 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:58.310
 and then with a black eyeliner 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.310
 I'm delineating my eyes 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.650
 it's a little stronger delineated how 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:06.260
 they can account not only in 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.830
 the top part but also from my 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.430
 eyes on the bottom and finally 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:16.430
 I'm using a mascara 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.590
 because well I do not know about you but I do not 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.060
 I'm using false eyelashes but 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.370
 yes I want we are going to use tabs 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.720
 false as it is optional personally 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.720
 I'm using mask 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.810
 that's all for the eyes now 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.620
 the lips the only thing I'm using 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:44.380
 it's a red lipstick but in the camera 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.380
 it looks half pink but it is not red 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.310
 and after life, be of 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.870
 Shine application that is also red 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.270
 but I do not know why it looks pink but 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.780
 good in the red 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:59.560
 because in the movie selina kyle of 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.950
 coal that comes out low for the 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.640
 hairstyle 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:08.180
 the only thing I'm doing is an average 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.190
 tail as you can see to which I do not know if 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.490
 is pressed and I had problems focusing 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.510
 in the camera should look good but 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.540
 good 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.250
 it only says a half tail and clear 

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:21.590
 I had to think about my hair 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:24.530
 because it 's the movie in hathaway what 

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:26.540
 it's very smooth and that's all 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:29.810
 you have to apply you have to 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:35.300
 put on the mask forgiveness and put yourself 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:36.430
 in joy with the ears that we just 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.660
 do 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:43.450
 Y 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.450
 I think if you're going to have something like that 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.630
 in this skype line 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:57.120
 I almost do not like this disguise I do not 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.120
 I spent almost nothing when doing it 

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:11.160
 now for the disguise the only thing I did 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.130
 was to put a black camera on me 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:15.960
 black pants use black boots but 

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:18.660
 again I had problems focusing on 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:21.600
 the camera and I could not focus the pants 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.820
 and the boots but good you can get 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:27.510
 Black gloves is optional but as you can see 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:30.780
 I did put them on and nothing I think 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:34.070
 that's all for the disguise 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.070
 it is very easy 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:39.550
 they are things that 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:42.760
 we usually have in the closet or in a 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:48.139
 closet and the truth I hope that I have 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:51.220
