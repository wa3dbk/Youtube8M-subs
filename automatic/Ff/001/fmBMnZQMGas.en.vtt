00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.729
 the top 3 of javi fernÃ¡ndez speakers without 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.320
 encode at this time the rebound in 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:12.170
 the window what would be the number 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:15.030
 3 place number 3 was the first 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.000
 phrase that I used to 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.369
 describe the prayers that actually 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.650
 it's not something that repeats a lot but it was the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.259
 that I opened the door that I 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:31.160
 I could say a bunch of stupid 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:31.160
 it was the prayers the smoke free fork 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.920
 place number 2 place number 2 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.000
 good for me is 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.280
 guys are pulling with everything 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.059
 impeccable and then we started the hairs 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.570
 to suck where everything was any 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.589
 thing 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:53.239
 cs the oranges with everything and the post 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.070
 undoubtedly number one the post 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.869
 number one, actually, I'm going to give you two 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.699
 number one decoration posts and another 

00:00:56.869 --> 00:01:00.710
 is the one that reminds me of people 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:02.619
 a lot this year but a lot because he 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.020
 they throw where everyone already has several years 

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:08.869
 but this year's was the technician 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:12.340
 technical is never or almost never what 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.950
 that the technical technical technician 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:19.960
 May 14 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.549
 here internally this does not find it 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.740
 but internally among us the 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.740
 technical I have I have is very favorite 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.869
 also that since I saw so much fight 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.899
 box with osvaldo is working in the 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:38.690
 marley ship is a phenomenon this 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.369
 beginning and of course there came a moment dsk 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.080
 a punch in the program and I did not know 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.860
 how to relate 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:48.800
 then I started searching among my disk 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:56.350
 stiff things of the deadly favorite kombat 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:59.630
 and the coach of palio wins fatalistic 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.630
 so there's everything in the number position 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.790
 one that I am with the heart is the one 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.620
 let's say tops and appears more in the 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.880
 program quantitatively and also going to 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.130
 be the name of the radio program that 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.110
 I'm going to make you see cocacola price and more 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.110
 nor less than it is very good
