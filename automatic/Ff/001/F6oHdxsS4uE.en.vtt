 the world she does not have doctors relatives 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:50.170
 Friends all initially believe they would 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.490
 I was joking first moment 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:56.320
 startled by the language what that 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:01:01.239
 simulated or will me what 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.790
 eyes but then I realized that seriously 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.859
 meant and then in tears 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.469
 she broke out on her fate 

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:09.719
 sabine is only discovered by the therapist 

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:12.340
 child shoe that the disease 

00:01:09.719 --> 00:01:13.329
 is called 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:15.670

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.840
 There are only 60 documented worldwide 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.280
 cause the cause 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.409
 if stroke became that 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.389
 Language Center happens the accent 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:25.780
 shifts the speech melody 

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:28.299
 the speed of the speech changes 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.350
 But it's not like that 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:35.740
 patient that fate overtakes that 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.759
 he suddenly totally changed his language 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.159
 speaks

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.450

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.340
 she has to explain her situation over 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:50.319

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:59.130
 have increased if you do not do that 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:02.740
 and stay at home and wait 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.299
 that goes even more on the psyche and 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.450
 you can not get out of this 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.100
