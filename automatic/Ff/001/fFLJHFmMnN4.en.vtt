00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:16.420
 at the beginning of the surf there was no localism 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.500
 in florianÃ³polis it 's ee we surfers 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.240
 hence 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.910
 we had a great pleasure it 's a great 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.250
 pride in spreading the word in saying 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:30.520
 that gives high waves and that was too much and 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:32.890
 this is so far that there has been a 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.160
 great change is that it was not an hour 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:40.720
 for the other but over the years the 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.850
 migration and immigration and the difficulty 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.160
 with traffic craud in water 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.550
 all this was changing the way of surfing 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.870
 stage is for sure the surfer he is 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.770
 territorialist then what can be 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:01.570
 call localism is not an attempt 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:03.850
 to preserve the quality of surfing in 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.379
 certain place to a quality 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.630
 amazing when we talk about 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.270
 localism understood we will never go 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:13.360
 be unanimous in this matter 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.130
 it is good to make clear that localism is 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.170
 controversial yes 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.420
 Can not you tell that it's bad, does not it? 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.700
 To say it's good we have a couple of 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.060
 or three pieces in floripa that have a 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.850
 big problem so didi localism nÃ© 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.909
 that joaquina beach I think the 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.039
 champion fc and a little with 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.219
 are beaches where there are many surfers who 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.929
 are from floripa that grew here that 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:41.200
 were created here who have learned to 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.659
 surfing I rather believe that 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.539
 people must respect and respect the 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.770
 places like I live here in the bar and 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.209
 I think people who come to surf 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.520
 here you have to respect people who have already 

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.889
 they are what already live here right now and some 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:57.219
 friends have several friends here from here. 

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:58.749
 talk until you play with me until raul and 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.869
 30 years here 

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:04.350
 for some to call the right to hound 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:08.229
 that surfer who is not from the place 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:11.080
 when the localism he emerged 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.780
 for a time as this place is mine 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.360
 You can not be here so this is 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.730
 extremely harmful because in the 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.520
 truth there is nothing more beautiful than 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.670
 To be human is to receive well and to be well. 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.670
 Received 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.230
 stayed out of the sofia a person when 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.300
 come from outside to come into your house 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.930
 anywhere there she has to show 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.190
 some respect can not come 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.530
 doing what you want 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:41.740
 after entering the house of the other already sit 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.750
 on the couch take control of the tv and start 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.100
 to choose the channels right 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.480
 It's the guy that comes to the beach that is not his. 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.640
 enter the sea and wanted to choose the waves 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.800
 and pass in front of everyone that your 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.000
 Real face plug ends up being all 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.280
 half selfish, right? 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.780
 If you want to catch a light wave, do not 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.390
 to share the session with a friend and 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.810
 such concentrates but only one at sea 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.150
 classic the majority of the galera wants 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:10.269
 quality account 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.550
 Is everyone dying of hunger? I'm 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:15.340
 always please common sense 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:19.090
 this character with common sense and with a 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.160
 good intention the localism is fine 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.530
 coming because it makes the person out 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.730
 enter the local rhythm of preservation 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.019
 from that location 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.910
 This does not mean that it will arrive. 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:30.360
 here you will not get where I am against 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.630
 that aggressive localism of 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.600
 pounding 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:36.850
 I think this leads to nothing but a 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.370
 some respect for those who are from the 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.799
 who was created here who lived here 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.019
 I think it's necessary for us to 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.090
 behavior is able to perceive the 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:47.650
 person who takes a wave behind the 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.750
 one that always will peak then 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.390
 people realize that it's local like that 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:57.010
 The Brazilian did not get very used to it. 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.660
 with that thing of respecting the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.750
 turnover 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:05.049
 You got a wave that's worth the other one. 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:07.989
 take here in Brazil as the wave of the deal 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.530
 here without rhyme here rhyme pro and the person 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:14.079
 do not know exactly where in the queue 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:16.299
 this would be conflict 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.690
 I do not know what determines a person 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:21.579
 think she can surf another cattle 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:24.010
 more than the other is the time she 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.500
 lives in that place and for how long has she 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.870
 take that place is how many times she 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.780
 goes a week or is simply a 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:34.370
 a crying question so I've already been 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.130
 used on beaches that 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.550
 was my darling right for example the thing 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:43.350
 This is how the guy stands out. 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:45.780
 in peak they excel with 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.150
 his aggression not in the wave of 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:50.940
 in a ninth maneuver but because 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:53.520
 He goes to the gym and is the ninth of this. 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:57.300
 so there is the technique of 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.970
 Turn it off and he's the guy who's going to get it. 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:03.450
 better wave because he can not 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:06.150
 That's when I ended up talking like this. 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:09.360
 Stay for you, stay close. 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:13.770
 I think it's another example of this. 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:17.190
 excessive individualism of the 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.780
 surfer any guy who knows that 

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:21.240
 It has a good elsewhere and will 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.840
 other places preaching on the good he leaves 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.850
 of being extremely localistic in the peak 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.010
 this is something that is there between 

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:32.310
 drought in person exists in localism 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.390
 fisherman exists localism in neighborhoods 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:35.390
 It exists in the surf too. 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.470
 ah
