00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.010
 welcome to healthy 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:08.250
 today we will talk about the low diet 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:11.130
 glycemic index to lose weight and to 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.799
 diabetes this type of diet is not 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.750
 takes into account both the calories but 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.320
 type of carbohydrates containing 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.850
 food consumed the glycemic index 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.880
 measures the glucose modification in the 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.990
 blood that generates each food 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.000
 remember that glucose is the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.150
 main source of energy for our 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.310
 organism with this diet is intended 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.800
 avoid strong insulin rises in the 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:36.930
 blood since the excess secretion of 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.540
 insulin generates significant deposits of 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.719
 fat that is fattening very much and 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.390
 limit your health it is important to know that 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.699
 insulin is an anabolic hormone 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.800
 secreted by the pancreas whose role 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:52.940
 The main thing is to transform excess 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.980
 glucose in body fat 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.860
 you have to get used to taking food 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.019
 with low glycemic index since the 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.780
 sugars in this case go to the blood 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:06.030
 slowly and secretion does not go off 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.890
 of insulin with what will avoid fattening 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.380
 you also have to keep in mind that there 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.690
 foods with high glycemic index 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.670
 due to its high percentage of 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.009
 carbohydrates but with low load 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.830
 glycemic as for example in fame 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.340
 oriana pumpkin of these foods if you 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.189
 recommends its consumption 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.990
 the foods to avoid or reduce their 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:30.560
 low-index diet intake 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.109
 glycemic are among others the flours 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.409
 refined processed foods like 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:38.719
 pizzas sausages and so on sugars 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.140
 refined and soft drinks with sugars 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.300
 additions and so on 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.729
 in another video we will put a list of 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:48.030
 foods with their respective indexes 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.030
 glycemic 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.740
