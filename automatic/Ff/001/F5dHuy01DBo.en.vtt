00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.769
 university I want and they did they are 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.740
 other things I do not know if I'm happy 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:37.559
 that's why it's father is like that feeling 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.770
 that you're going to finish a cycle and how 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.600
 that is coming or you do not know what's coming 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.329
 then I do not know how I bring a vibes 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.820
 rare but good write my list and today 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.860
 what we are going to do is recycle the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.570
 shadows that have already been broken but no longer 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.180
 we are surely you also have 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.699
 many of entries with shadows their 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.520
 knives like all those who neither 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.800
 no longer use and well now we are going to 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.180
 give a second use let's do 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:08.190
 a bronze an illuminator and a blush and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.130
 well these are going to make you super useful 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:17.500
 because with these you will be able to do the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:21.430
 Contouring and the illuminator of the face 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.970
 the cheeks a little thinner or the 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.600
 nose and all this is the technique of 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.150
 control highlighting and well then this 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.010
 Habit technique is super trendy in 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.380
 how much makeup because you really 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.930
 change the whole face and it helps you a lot 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.780
 to highlight the parts and really 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.950
 you want to be highlighted and that you like it 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.100
 I do not know if you have enough 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.280
 As you know, you are high in both 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.929
 cheeks and highlight your lips with more 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:56.549
 in the nose or if your forehead is very big 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:59.759
 and you want it to look a bit more digital 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:03.090
 what you can do is shade this 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.819
 part so that the visual effect is a 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.369
 little more than it look a little smaller 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:12.360
 for journalistic work then what 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:16.410
 you need to make the bronze 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.490
 with a shadow clothes that already admits me in 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.490
 coffee color 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.020
 in some tone that is going to consult me â€‹â€‹more 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:29.610
 to need a cream that with what 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:32.190
 let's give the texture 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:35.790
 I chose this design that this inclusion 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:39.600
 is a click a stain removal cream that 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.760
 has eye blocker blocks and 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.420
 Well, that's going to help pretty well 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:49.050
 because apart from the system itself 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.720
 we also need a spatula and a 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.140
 plastic and we also need some 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:57.120
 containers like these that I had before 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.940
 the proper name that broke 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.490
 light bulbs he beat for the bronze to 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.800
 the illuminator and for the blog that we believe 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:07.990
 We put the plastic paper and the area 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:14.670
 what are we going to reuse 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.670
 we put it here a long sprint 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.880
 and I recommend you go 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.460
 where 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.220
 for the illuminator makes a delight 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:48.000
 and I like that pink tone 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.940
 Y 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:25.130
 the three shades in cream is bronze 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:25.130
 the illuminator and the blog in cream 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:33.090
 Well now the technique for what 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.990
 profile is much more your face with a 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.010
 brush 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:41.620
 The first thing we are going to mark is with the 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:47.220
 bronze let's name those areas 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:47.220
 that we want to decrease 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.190
 Now let's apply now that you have 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.470
 clean your brush 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:27.950
 the ine 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:31.570
 and good the illuminator 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:31.570
 in all the part of here 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:52.080
 no no 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.430
 all right 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.830
 Well, if you realize if you see 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:08.670
 much more profiled lucanas changes 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:11.250
 totally like the way you even see yourself 

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:13.270
 a little bit more tanned I do not know to me 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:18.720
 really liked it 

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.720
 and good only what would be missing is the blog 

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:26.200
 because I think if I have very pink 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.160
 so 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.160
 where one 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.520
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:41.220
 this guy and that you serve that you unhappy 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.860
 all its shadows that it no longer occupies and 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:46.560
 well you have a second use because 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:51.240
 we must listen to everyone and it is very 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:54.150
 well 27 some comment or some idea or 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:56.400
 video suggestion that you want that that 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:59.580
 something that can help you by hand between 

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:05.220
 here also blogs look for us pesos as if 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:08.910
 we were the same and tomorrow whenever 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:11.450
