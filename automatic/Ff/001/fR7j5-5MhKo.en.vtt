is<00:01:05.850> Jason<00:01:06.360> Myers<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.900> keep<00:01:07.110> calling<00:01:07.290> them

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
is Jason Myers I keep calling them

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.920 
is Jason Myers I keep calling them
Brandon<00:01:08.100> Myers<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.670> don't<00:01:08.850> know<00:01:08.970> why<00:01:09.180> maybe

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
Brandon Myers I don't know why maybe

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.170 
Brandon Myers I don't know why maybe
it's<00:01:10.140> because<00:01:10.320> when<00:01:11.130> other<00:01:11.369> kickers<00:01:11.760> come

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
it's because when other kickers come

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.690 
it's because when other kickers come
into<00:01:12.450> Jacksonville<00:01:13.140> they<00:01:13.920> could<00:01:14.159> cut<00:01:14.400> at<00:01:14.670> the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
into Jacksonville they could cut at the

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.940 
into Jacksonville they could cut at the
end<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.060> preseason<00:01:15.630> because<00:01:16.140> Scobie<00:01:16.590> was<00:01:16.770> the

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
end of preseason because Scobie was the

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.660 
end of preseason because Scobie was the
better<00:01:17.159> kicker<00:01:17.520> I<00:01:18.680> understand<00:01:19.680> Scobie<00:01:20.430> had<00:01:20.610> a

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
better kicker I understand Scobie had a

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.490 
better kicker I understand Scobie had a
rough<00:01:21.030> year<00:01:21.240> last<00:01:21.360> season<00:01:21.810> but<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.350> was

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
rough year last season but that was

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.740 
rough year last season but that was
mainly<00:01:22.830> because<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.460> her<00:01:23.850> offensive<00:01:24.299> line

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
mainly because of her offensive line

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.560 
mainly because of her offensive line
they<00:01:25.740> cannot<00:01:26.100> block<00:01:26.430> for<00:01:26.700> shit<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.299> don't

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
they cannot block for shit and don't

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.510 
they cannot block for shit and don't
forget<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.170> bortles<00:01:28.619> was<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:29.009> most<00:01:29.220> sacked

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
forget that bortles was the most sacked

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.569 
forget that bortles was the most sacked
quarterback<00:01:29.759> I<00:01:30.590> won't<00:01:31.590> be<00:01:31.740> surprised<00:01:32.220> if

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
quarterback I won't be surprised if

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.330 
quarterback I won't be surprised if
Myers<00:01:32.880> goes<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> similar<00:01:34.020> route<00:01:34.470> as<00:01:34.829> Scobie

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
Myers goes for a similar route as Scobie

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
ahead of him especially that he's a

ahead of him especially that he's a
rookie<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.700> know<00:01:41.700> Jason<00:01:42.180> Myers<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:43.170> kick

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
