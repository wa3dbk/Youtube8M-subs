here you'll notice the kill elapses

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.729 
here you'll notice the kill elapses
first<00:03:38.610> and<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.360> brightness<00:03:39.660> toggle<00:03:40.350> is<00:03:40.500> a

first and the brightness toggle is a

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.050 
first and the brightness toggle is a
little<00:03:40.950> bit<00:03:41.040> lower<00:03:41.250> in<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:42.470> field<00:03:43.470> here<00:03:44.060> so

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
little bit lower in the field here so

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.610 
little bit lower in the field here so
let's<00:03:45.209> say<00:03:45.270> if<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:45.450> want<00:03:45.600> the<00:03:45.690> Wi-Fi<00:03:46.110> plug-in

let's say if I want the Wi-Fi plug-in

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.199 
let's say if I want the Wi-Fi plug-in
first<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.220> can<00:03:47.340> just<00:03:47.489> go<00:03:47.550> ahead<00:03:47.580> and<00:03:47.700> move<00:03:47.970> it

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
first I can just go ahead and move it

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.570 
first I can just go ahead and move it
and<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:49.260> Wi-Fi<00:03:49.790> becomes<00:03:50.790> first<00:03:52.010> so<00:03:53.010> guys<00:03:53.160> that

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:53.580 
and the Wi-Fi becomes first so guys that

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.900 
and the Wi-Fi becomes first so guys that
is<00:03:54.170> simplexity<00:03:55.170> simplexity<00:03:55.980> is<00:03:56.250> available<00:03:56.790> in
