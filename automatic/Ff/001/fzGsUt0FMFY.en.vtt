very very little will they say either
but<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.480> want<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.660> understand<00:00:15.990> when<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.590> why

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
but we want to understand when and why

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.040 
but we want to understand when and why
we<00:00:17.100> do<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.340> things<00:00:17.550> that<00:00:17.670> we<00:00:17.760> do<00:00:17.910> it<00:00:18.810> so<00:00:18.930> right

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
we do the things that we do it so right

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.929 
we do the things that we do it so right
now<00:00:19.230> my<00:00:19.650> defender<00:00:20.070> might<00:00:20.369> determine<00:00:20.820> what

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
now my defender might determine what

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.019 
now my defender might determine what
hand<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.900> finish<00:00:22.619> with<00:00:22.800> so<00:00:23.400> if<00:00:23.460> I<00:00:23.550> were<00:00:23.670> to<00:00:23.730> drive

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
hand I finish with so if I were to drive

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.060 
hand I finish with so if I were to drive
and<00:00:24.269> he's<00:00:24.359> on<00:00:24.510> my<00:00:24.600> left<00:00:24.869> hip<00:00:25.109> now<00:00:25.380> obviously<00:00:25.769> I

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
and he's on my left hip now obviously I

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.560 
and he's on my left hip now obviously I
want<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.609> finish<00:00:26.730> away<00:00:27.060> from<00:00:27.240> him<00:00:27.330> with<00:00:27.449> my

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
want to finish away from him with my

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.660 
want to finish away from him with my
right<00:00:27.750> hand<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:29.010> had<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.160> shooter<00:00:29.460> in<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
right hand if I had a shooter in the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.269 
right hand if I had a shooter in the
corner<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.240> I'm<00:00:31.230> driving<00:00:31.500> more<00:00:31.830> right<00:00:32.040> and

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
corner and I'm driving more right and

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.010 
corner and I'm driving more right and
this<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.820> who<00:00:32.910> I'm<00:00:33.030> worried<00:00:33.270> about<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.960> I

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
this is who I'm worried about and I

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.170 
this is who I'm worried about and I
might<00:00:34.290> switch<00:00:34.649> left<00:00:35.340> hand<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:35.880> try<00:00:36.120> to

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
might switch left hand and try to

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.420 
might switch left hand and try to
squeeze<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.630> in<00:00:36.750> that<00:00:36.899> way<00:00:37.110> knowing<00:00:37.950> that

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
squeeze it in that way knowing that

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.740 
squeeze it in that way knowing that
that's<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.850> defender<00:00:39.149> I'm<00:00:39.239> more<00:00:39.420> concerned

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
that's the defender I'm more concerned

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.569 
that's the defender I'm more concerned
about<00:00:40.020> so<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.590> defender<00:00:40.950> will<00:00:41.129> determine<00:00:41.370> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
about so the defender will determine the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.790 
about so the defender will determine the
hand<00:00:41.850> I<00:00:42.059> finish<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.570> but<00:00:43.320> what<00:00:43.440> determines

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
hand I finish with but what determines

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.860 
hand I finish with but what determines
the<00:00:43.920> feet<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.640> this<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.539> when<00:00:45.660> we<00:00:45.719> have<00:00:45.809> to

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
the feet and this is when we have to

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.389 
the feet and this is when we have to
tell<00:00:46.020> players<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.469> not<00:00:46.680> as<00:00:46.890> much<00:00:47.100> about<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
tell players it's not as much about the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.600 
tell players it's not as much about the
defender<00:00:47.789> anymore<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.899> about<00:00:49.079> space<00:00:49.610> space

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
defender anymore it's about space space

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.130 
defender anymore it's about space space
determines<00:00:51.149> our<00:00:51.210> footwork<00:00:51.600> and<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.899> if<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.020> get

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
determines our footwork and so if we get

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.720 
determines our footwork and so if we get
ingrained<00:00:52.500> where<00:00:52.770> I'm<00:00:52.890> more<00:00:53.160> than<00:00:53.340> likely<00:00:53.550> you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
ingrained where I'm more than likely you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.790 
ingrained where I'm more than likely you
want<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:53.940> jump<00:00:54.180> from<00:00:54.660> these<00:00:54.809> spots<00:00:55.140> when<00:00:55.770> I

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
want to jump from these spots when I

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.920 
want to jump from these spots when I
have<00:00:56.010> congested<00:00:56.489> areas<00:00:56.850> whatever<00:00:57.719> at

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
have congested areas whatever at

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.540 
have congested areas whatever at
whatever<00:00:58.170> foot<00:00:58.559> I<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:59.010> there<00:00:59.250> at<00:00:59.370> that

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
whatever foot I have there at that

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.760 
whatever foot I have there at that
moment<00:00:59.789> will<00:01:00.690> be<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.870> foot<00:01:01.050> that<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.199> should<00:01:01.620> be

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
moment will be the foot that I should be

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.410 
moment will be the foot that I should be
able<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.980> jump<00:01:02.160> off<00:01:02.340> of<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.579> I<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.820> choose<00:01:02.850> I

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
able to jump off of if I so choose I

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.420 
able to jump off of if I so choose I
just<00:01:03.960> don't<00:01:04.080> want<00:01:04.199> my<00:01:04.290> feet<00:01:04.559> handcuffed<00:01:05.189> I

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
just don't want my feet handcuffed I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.250 
just don't want my feet handcuffed I
don't<00:01:05.820> want<00:01:05.970> him<00:01:06.060> shackled<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.750> don't<00:01:07.080> have<00:01:07.170> to

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
don't want him shackled I don't have to

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.140 
don't want him shackled I don't have to
jump<00:01:07.500> when<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:07.770> moments<00:01:08.070> right<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.850> so<00:01:09.000> this

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
jump when the moments right and so this

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.880 
jump when the moments right and so this
is<00:01:09.270> my<00:01:09.390> shot<00:01:09.659> blocker<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.229> I<00:01:10.260> take<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:10.619> first

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
is my shot blocker and I take that first

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.539 
is my shot blocker and I take that first
step

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
step

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.520 
step
knowing<00:01:12.420> that<00:01:12.570> he's<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> little<00:01:13.170> bit<00:01:13.290> there

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
knowing that he's a little bit there

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.980 
knowing that he's a little bit there
knowing<00:01:14.400> my<00:01:14.640> space<00:01:15.000> there's<00:01:15.570> nothing<00:01:15.869> wrong

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
knowing my space there's nothing wrong

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.080 
knowing my space there's nothing wrong
with<00:01:16.049> me<00:01:16.320> jumping<00:01:16.619> off<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.920> first<00:01:17.130> step<00:01:17.520> as

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
with me jumping off that first step as

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.820 
with me jumping off that first step as
long<00:01:18.330> as<00:01:18.479> I've<00:01:18.570> worked<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> finish<00:01:19.619> and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
long as I've worked on the finish and

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.940 
long as I've worked on the finish and
then<00:01:20.460> see<00:01:20.759> if<00:01:21.030> he's<00:01:21.479> even<00:01:21.630> able<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:22.020> time<00:01:22.320> or

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
then see if he's even able to time or

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.010 
then see if he's even able to time or
strip<00:01:23.280> me<00:01:23.400> or<00:01:23.520> block<00:01:23.729> me<00:01:23.970> knowing<00:01:24.659> that<00:01:24.810> I

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
strip me or block me knowing that I

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.499 
strip me or block me knowing that I
haven't<00:01:25.380> taken<00:01:25.650> my<00:01:25.950> second<00:01:26.369> step<00:01:26.549> yet<00:01:26.820> so

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
haven't taken my second step yet so

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.620 
haven't taken my second step yet so
let's<00:01:27.630> take<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.810> look<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.189> called<00:01:29.460> push<00:01:29.909> to

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
let's take a look this is called push to

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.719 
let's take a look this is called push to
the<00:01:30.659> edge<00:01:30.900> now<00:01:31.770> what<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:31.950> want<00:01:32.220> him<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.460> do<00:01:32.579> and

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
the edge now what I want him to do and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.249 
the edge now what I want him to do and
this<00:01:32.790> isn't<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.119> race<00:01:33.329> for<00:01:33.630> me<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.049> I'm<00:01:34.140> not<00:01:34.200> just

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
this isn't a race for me so I'm not just

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.660 
this isn't a race for me so I'm not just
going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> be<00:01:34.619> how<00:01:34.740> fast<00:01:35.070> I<00:01:35.220> get<00:01:35.369> to<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.490> basket

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
going to be how fast I get to the basket

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.450 
going to be how fast I get to the basket
I'm<00:01:36.240> gonna<00:01:36.450> keep<00:01:36.659> his<00:01:36.869> contact<00:01:37.380> off<00:01:37.590> me<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:38.009> so

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
I'm gonna keep his contact off me and so

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.640 
I'm gonna keep his contact off me and so
when<00:01:38.579> he<00:01:38.610> pushes<00:01:39.119> me<00:01:39.329> and<00:01:39.509> I'm<00:01:40.140> trying<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.470> keep

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
when he pushes me and I'm trying to keep

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.990 
when he pushes me and I'm trying to keep
my<00:01:40.799> straight<00:01:41.130> line<00:01:41.159> I'm<00:01:41.460> not<00:01:41.579> gonna<00:01:41.700> turn<00:01:41.820> my

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
my straight line I'm not gonna turn my

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.760 
my straight line I'm not gonna turn my
body<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:42.810> I<00:01:42.869> also<00:01:43.110> need<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.350> understand<00:01:43.680> that

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
body but I also need to understand that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.889 
body but I also need to understand that
space<00:01:44.189> is<00:01:44.430> gonna<00:01:44.549> determine<00:01:44.640> when<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.090> jump<00:01:45.450> and

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
space is gonna determine when I jump and

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:47.600 
space is gonna determine when I jump and
so<00:01:46.259> while<00:01:46.409> he<00:01:46.439> pushes<00:01:46.979> pushes<00:01:47.189> pushes

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
so while he pushes pushes pushes

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.520 
so while he pushes pushes pushes
whatever<00:01:48.030> foot<00:01:48.329> ends<00:01:48.659> up<00:01:48.750> being<00:01:48.899> at<00:01:49.079> this<00:01:49.200> spot

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
whatever foot ends up being at this spot

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.200 
whatever foot ends up being at this spot
I'm<00:01:49.950> gonna<00:01:50.189> jump<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:50.640> and<00:01:50.820> stretch<00:01:51.030> to<00:01:51.060> the

I'm gonna jump with and stretch to the
