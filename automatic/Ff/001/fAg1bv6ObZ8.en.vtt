00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
 hey like and welcome to one 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.850
 new video 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.220
 today it's about 14 the edw guard that 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.809
 means facts about a diet what a 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.490
 actually only one is supposed to help 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.530
 are myth and not at all true 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.179
 I want to uncover that for you today 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.039
 and I thought that was totally fitting 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.410
 Lately, you often get food drinks 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.660
 food woods and nutritional videos and me 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.490
 think that fits in very well and 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.350
 when you see her now the first 7 the 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.090
 raging earth and the remaining seven 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.529
 You can count his title Geneva 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.750
 at the dear hammer on her canal 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.910
 just see the hammer I think she has 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.590
 much much more subscribers for that 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.630
 Please look over there I find 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.940
 she can speak classical music in front of the camera 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.890
 she makes really great videos and videos 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.420
 I just love to listen and 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.309
 I believe that we are also something for you 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.469
 Now we start with the seven 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:51.390
 myths and then I'll refer to later 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:53.670
 the dear hannah myth number one 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.500
 Other burns fat without end 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.239
 special enzymes in the body should 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.609
 Prevent the use of the fed 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.410
 takes place and that's supposed to mean you can 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.270
 eat as much fatty food as you want 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.769
 if you are different and do not take 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.360
 yes we love that is unfortunately one 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.250
 myth because these enzymes exist 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.340
 actually and not only because of that 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.510
 The pineapple is also a very healthy fruit 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.159
 however, if and only if these enzymes 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.259
 actually needed in the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.770
 thumb because there is the recovery 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.720
 also held 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.369
 unfortunately they would not know anymore 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.170
 they practically disabled them in the thumb 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.909
 and so it is unfortunately one 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.130
 myth and the pineapple is great 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.140
 healthy but will not help you that 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.240
 you so rich in fat you want to eat 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.400
 and does not increase myth number 2 sorry 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.680
 products help you lose weight 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.180
 yes that may be a piquant topic 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.680
 if I want to lose weight I buy 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.240
 exclusively only light products 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.590
 or I prefer to keep it consistent 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.119
 buys the normal products 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.590
 many are arguing too 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.750
 my sewer pipes have often been discussed 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.100
 if that's good if I light sometimes 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.610
 buy products or not 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.030
 and we know it on together 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.950
 in fact it is like that 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.930
 Light products under the line really 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.149
 Most people have less calories too 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.920
 less fat and and and the problem 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.420
 it is only that light products 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.979
 because they have less 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.850
 So it can be less filling 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.039
 you are buying 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.899
 according to cheese for example and then it 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.610
 just twice as much and then you have 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.560
 you in principle all the calories after all 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.180
 back on the end that means that 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.950
 treacherous in light products is unfortunately 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.600
 that when you buy light products 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.010
 and you do not eat together will like 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.540
 if you just normal products 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.760
 would eat and the consequence of that 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.250
 more of this is another problem 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:28.260
 Light products is often about that 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:29.790
 fat what was educated the whole and 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.959
 the whole taste anyway 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.880
 to produce reasonably 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.020
 More sugar in light products is than 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.430
 in normal products 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.230
 that's why it makes sense here if 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.880
 your lead product and normal product 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.560
 Just compare in the supermarket 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.420
 look at the rough style behind and 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.280
 really look closely at the sugar 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.110
 and my carbohydrates if that 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.610
 the end product no longer has it at the end 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.050
 to get this fat back in again 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.750
 war simply speaks the taste 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.370
 somehow get in and yes then 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.930
 can you look what you better 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.670
 takes place before the nutrition and then 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.410
 In a specific case, that's how it is 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:04.049
 I do that, for example, synonymous myth 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.569
 number three local hero permanently slim 

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:08.220
 yes, that's where we arrived at what 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.420
 I too am affected of course 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.850
 because as you know I have often 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:15.000
 low carb diet made a lot of talk 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:16.860
 on flour and carbohydrate-rich products 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.989
 waived bread and waived 

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:21.510
 I would rather eat fatty stuff and 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.340
 Little carbs had this side 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.810
 actually works that is 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.730
 actually proved that one with 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.109
 lockout can really decrease effectively 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.570
 and that worked for me too 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:32.760
 So I can confirm that as well 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.980
 The problem, however, is only there 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.560
 still no long-term studies as low 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.910
 carb in the long run affects this low 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.590
 carb diet that's not there yet 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.570
 20 years but it is the last 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.010
 Years have come very strong and you can 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.510
 unfortunately not yet confirm that 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.549
 it is really healthy when you have the body 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.650
 so much fat and so little 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:50.970
 carbohydrates there were already individual 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.160
 where the whole thing is not so good 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.660
 tolerate or because of the acidic household 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.700
 in your body can be quite nice 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.170
 I would be messed up 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.150
 but just be from my experience 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:02.069
 out if their purchase but makes the 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.170
 do not exaggerate then you really have 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.870
 very good chances to lose weight and if 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.370
 you do not end up without it 

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:09.319
 are you pure then you can do that 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.870
 Jojo effect also somewhat avoid 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.640
 So that's not a real myth 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:16.579
 actually works you believe 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:21.139
 but should do that in measure and it 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:23.240
 Do not overdo it with ass number 4 and 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.199
 You have to go to any diet 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.330
 warp 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.699
 most like listening to a diet 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.100
 to abstain from drinking sweet drinks 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.440
 on any sweet food of his cake 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.150
 biscuits or sweets and ban 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.250
 everything that has to do with sugar 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.990
 your kitchen, however, as you are already in the 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.639
 child is getting taught 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:43.520
 Sugar is our biggest and most important 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:45.050
 Energy supplier no matter if we are the fruit 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.690
 tank or really in candy or 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.190
 anywhere else sugar supplies energy that knows 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:50.780
 I think pretty much everyone and 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.160
 that's why it's not healthy at all 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.960
 completely renounce the future 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.760
 and nothing at all to yourself 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.740
 take something in sugar form 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.150
 contains if we physically 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.039
 We will do exhausting work 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.169
 totally drained and broken 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.449
 and also if we are mentally exhausting 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.190
 work is lacking this energy 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:08.960
 Just totally and we can 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:10.310
 we will focus poorly 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.810
 probably totally exhausted and tired 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.880
 be and maybe get 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.590
 Sleep disorders or other problems 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.389
 that is why it is not advisable 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.160
 completely refrain from sugar in 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:20.930
 a diet and really everything away 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.340
 leave because there are really a few 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.169
 healthy alternatives such as 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.240
 fruit where he also contains fructose 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.919
 the sugar is really on the body 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.720
 a healthy way of doing it 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:33.460
 can do well and therefore forbids you 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:37.490
 Do not eat sugar in a diet 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:38.870
 myth about five breakfast makes you fat yes 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.890
 I too have this for the very first time 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:41.930
 heard but it actually exists 

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:44.180
 breakfast opponents absolutely the opinion 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.190
 the breakfast is thick 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:48.020
 But that is a myth, though 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.820
 So I can all calm you down 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.530
 calms down on breakfast 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.690
 because actually it is that way 

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:56.360
 complete calorie intake over the 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:57.980
 All day counts for one means that if 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.110
 her morning the breakfast of load and 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.030
 then for lunch and dinner but from me 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:03.950
 Then calculates 1000 calories per meal 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.000
 it does not help you at all in the end 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.860
 only to take 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.830
 that's why it's actually good about that 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:11.210
 distributed throughout the day and thus in the morning 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:13.100
 enough to eat something 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.510
 one is also full in between and before 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.490
 Everything for younger people for children 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:18.260
 a breakfast is very important 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.970
 just to get the energy for the day 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.440
 and not immediately so tired and 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:23.240
 thumb in the day to start and 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:27.560
 that's why you can of course quite 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:30.140
 calms down breakfast myth number 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.910
 6 off for tees leave the wound points 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.530
 yes, there are actually many people 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:35.419
 who do not really like one too 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.010
 calorie reduction for losing weight and also 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.870
 not really the mood for sports also 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.430
 I already have this phase through this 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:41.150
 people are therefore very much on the move 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:42.650
 pharmacy 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:44.120
 because that's the whole food 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:45.440
 not really a body shot 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:47.120
 it will go straight to the digestion 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.250
 slipped and thus the whole 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.060
 Nutrients not great a body 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.070
 recycled 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.169
 However, this is totally harmful and 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:56.330
 that's why it can be called a myth 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:57.710
 called because such an apple is 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.360
 really only useful if you are under 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:01.310
 Constipation suffers and there is one 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:02.900
 further helps if you apple tea such there 

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:04.580
 it can be regular 

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:06.229
 that damaged the intestinal flora 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:07.720
 and this is hugely important for ours 

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:10.490
 whole body and for our immune system 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:12.050
 that they also get used to it and 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.790
 that's just more common and so 

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:15.790
 to clog more regularly 

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:22.350
 seven of the sauna can help now 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:24.120
 what a positive anticipation of the sauna is 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:25.980
 actually very healthy for us 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.860
 He trains the vessels and the one 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.570
 immune system the other part is unfortunately 

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.000
 and I also know some of that 

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.980
 of you already who his makes the 

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.450
 just sweat out a lot of water and 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:38.220
 he just has to do it like you do 

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:40.020
 Drink otherwise the body has 

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:41.790
 just a lot of water loss what not 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.230
 good for us some people mean 

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.940
 however, if you are regular 

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:46.470
 summer power speaks once a week 

00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:48.240
 it really sweats through you 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.280
 can also burn fat and that has 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.140
 unfortunately turns out to be a myth because 

00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:54.030
 be that it actually burns 

00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:55.950
 no fat but only loses water 

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:58.020
 and somehow I have to do it again in the end 

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:59.910
 get back to life so that was mine 

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.260
 seven diets if you are now for 

00:07:59.910 --> 00:08:02.460
