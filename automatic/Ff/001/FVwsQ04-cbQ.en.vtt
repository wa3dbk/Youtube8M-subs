okay we're back what we've done so far

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.410 
okay we're back what we've done so far
is<00:00:04.259> we've<00:00:04.440> come<00:00:04.680> along<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:05.100> back<00:00:05.279> edge<00:00:05.549> here's

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
is we've come along the back edge here's

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.600 
is we've come along the back edge here's
the<00:00:06.569> main<00:00:06.750> 24-pin<00:00:07.470> power<00:00:07.710> supply<00:00:08.130> connector

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
the main 24-pin power supply connector

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.640 
the main 24-pin power supply connector
as<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:09.480> can<00:00:09.599> see<00:00:09.840> that's<00:00:10.170> plugged<00:00:10.410> in<00:00:10.620> right

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
as you can see that's plugged in right

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.980 
as you can see that's plugged in right
there<00:00:11.130> run<00:00:11.460> through<00:00:11.700> the<00:00:11.820> back<00:00:12.000> I've<00:00:12.719> actually

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
there run through the back I've actually

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.980 
there run through the back I've actually
slid<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:14.460> bay<00:00:14.700> in<00:00:14.969> here<00:00:15.240> to<00:00:15.389> see<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.839> if

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
slid the the bay in here to see that if

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.330 
slid the the bay in here to see that if
that<00:00:16.139> would<00:00:16.289> interfere<00:00:16.500> with<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:16.890> cable<00:00:17.250> and

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
that would interfere with the cable and

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.730 
that would interfere with the cable and
we<00:00:17.430> got<00:00:17.580> just<00:00:17.850> enough<00:00:18.210> space<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.900> get<00:00:19.470> in<00:00:19.590> there

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
we got just enough space to get in there

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.890 
we got just enough space to get in there
and<00:00:20.010> pull<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> little<00:00:20.850> hard<00:00:21.029> to<00:00:21.150> see<00:00:21.390> but

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
and pull you a little hard to see but

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.890 
and pull you a little hard to see but
there's<00:00:22.140> an<00:00:22.230> 8-pin<00:00:22.590> connector<00:00:23.660> here<00:00:24.660> that

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
there's an 8-pin connector here that

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.080 
there's an 8-pin connector here that
actually<00:00:25.109> have<00:00:25.619> just<00:00:26.070> enough<00:00:26.310> slack<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.730> run

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
actually have just enough slack to run

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.150 
actually have just enough slack to run
up<00:00:27.210> through<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.539> back<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.019> get<00:00:28.590> through<00:00:28.890> here

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
up through the back and get through here

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.009 
up through the back and get through here
without<00:00:29.730> showing<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.269> lot<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.510> cable<00:00:30.840> right

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
without showing a lot of cable right

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.569 
without showing a lot of cable right
underneath<00:00:31.820> the<00:00:32.820> big<00:00:33.390> exhaust<00:00:34.350> fan<00:00:34.649> a<00:00:34.680> big<00:00:34.950> 200

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
underneath the big exhaust fan a big 200

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.010 
underneath the big exhaust fan a big 200
millimeter<00:00:35.910> exhaust<00:00:36.270> fan<00:00:36.510> that's<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
millimeter exhaust fan that's going to

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.770 
millimeter exhaust fan that's going to
check<00:00:37.290> their<00:00:37.500> out<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.950> top<00:00:38.160> right<00:00:38.399> here<00:00:38.780> they

check their out the top right here they

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.170 
check their out the top right here they
actually<00:00:39.960> cut<00:00:40.440> a<00:00:40.469> slot<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.430> little<00:00:41.730> hard<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.969> see

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
actually cut a slot a little hard to see

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.940 
actually cut a slot a little hard to see
for<00:00:42.450> cable<00:00:42.750> management<00:00:42.780> so<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.469> come<00:00:43.739> down

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
for cable management so you come down

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.319 
for cable management so you come down
through<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.250> top<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.610> love<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.120> that's

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
through the top I love that that's

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.080 
through the top I love that that's
actually<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.809> really<00:00:45.899> really<00:00:46.230> nice<00:00:46.410> feature<00:00:47.090> so

really want these facing outward this is

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.050 
really want these facing outward this is
a<00:02:34.620> much<00:02:34.920> better<00:02:34.950> design<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.730> have<00:02:35.880> these

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
a much better design to have these

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.720 
a much better design to have these
offset<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.020> facing<00:02:37.830> towards<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.190> back<00:02:38.460> and
