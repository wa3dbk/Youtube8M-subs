for<00:01:43.310> a<00:01:43.340> much<00:01:43.550> more<00:01:43.580> stable<00:01:44.090> flight<00:01:44.560> now<00:01:45.560> let's

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
for a much more stable flight now let's

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.590 
for a much more stable flight now let's
move<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:45.950> transmitter<00:01:46.490> control<00:01:46.850> slowly<00:01:47.270> and

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
move the transmitter control slowly and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.420 
move the transmitter control slowly and
gradually<00:01:47.750> until<00:01:48.440> you<00:01:48.560> become<00:01:48.800> familiar<00:01:48.950> with
