00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 fábio which is demonstrated in the air one more 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:10.410
 ask the hill for you my puto 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:13.139
 trust me the first question goes 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.389
 of jonny ribeiro monstro have 40 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.150
 centimeters of arm what I do for 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.100
 improve performance in disrupting 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.689
 muscle fibers training heavy or 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.430
 light loads or 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.310
 heavy loads 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.800
 Good, I advise you to make a mess. 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.500
 Each of these exercises has a form 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.710
 a week there is very heavy and takes more 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.410
 two weeks training very light trainer training 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.140
 but the other week he trains with enough 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.469
 conjugated and so it goes until you 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.090
 right spot where you get fatigue 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.219
 hypertrophic microregional film is 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:52.350
 your question fernando gabriel monte 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.480
 I wonder if marijuana does badly 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.879
 on bodybuilding hugged her fan 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.460
 good marijuana but do not smoke marijuana 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.260
 maybe it could hurt you if you get a 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.600
 bit too wrong to make your 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:07.049
 part but there are people who use because it gives 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:10.619
 mental focus is not for those who do not 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.260
 for those who have seen Bosnia for 1 2 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.340
 then each one is each one I 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:20.040
 I particularly think that it would not help 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.020
 next jefferson carvalho showed my 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.979
 name is jessica is cast of white river 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.110
 of the acre 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.970
 The maromas here really like your 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:32.310
 work a salve proacre is far but it is 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.229
 A salve for you, the salt will take time. 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.720
 to get there but will arrive 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.680
 I wonder if I'm right in 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:43.140
 train chest and shoulder biceps and triceps and 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:47.250
 the other day, leg and back 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.590
 What can I do to get better? 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.899
 combing the same day said of sad in the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:57.090
 another such a little strange because what 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.180
 we use the triceps of the chest training 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:05.219
 and in the wave training then you will have 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:09.640
 used the twice-repeated trips to 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:12.730
 improve the boot boot legs and back 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.569
 in the middle of beauty 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:19.030
 jonathan castro léo monster i admire your 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.580
 I work in the family channel of mons 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.560
 took my doubts in evolving a lot 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.420
 in my time I want you gave me a tip 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.580
 or how to obtain maturity 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.800
 muscle or in the case as known 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.350
 muscle density without the volume and 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.390
 muscle mass does not mean in city 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.720
 can you instruct us how to get there and what city 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.660
 embraced your good muscle density fan and 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.120
 muscular maturity so well have a 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:46.720
 line that divides the two 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:49.120
 these two these two adjectives there 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.160
 understood then you reach 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.560
 muscular maturity the name already says is 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.880
 maturity do you need years of 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.130
 training you reach maturity 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.070
 that muscular maturity is the 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:02.519
 aspect of muscle muscle that for more 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:04.810
 that you are not in heavy training 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.090
 You can give a relaxed one that he does not 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.010
 will disappear and will remain the same and this is 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.830
 What we use to train turns your 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.170
 the density of the plot is the 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.880
 The way you do today is also 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.920
 to do with training time is not in the 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.560
 at first you will get density but it is 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.420
 more to do with the diet that every curve is 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.850
 a body so when a guy as a 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.410
 can adjust the intake of 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.480
 carbohydrates for being right that the 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.760
 world as a body in June it 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:33.010
 can synthesize right 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.180
 Can you start creating an injury? 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:39.510
 muscular 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:43.150
 the next muscle density goes from the 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:45.220
 réver tones 40 monsters the best 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.750
 bodybuilding training program 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.220
 largest trainee program demonstrates that 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.440
 the motorcycle factory shitload 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:56.010
 Next gabriel rabelo good morning showed 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.770
 when the mine gets louder when you use 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:03.990
 jump what to do I'm down I have 1 70 e 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.820
 use leap also goio davis lima léo 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:08.220
 showed my question in relation to 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.950
 periodization of training or as you 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.080
 is to know what needs to change its 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.880
 type of training that establishes a time and 

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.530
 then changes his molt when he realizes that 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.850
 is necessary and that training no longer 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.829
 we are having more result 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.549
 congratulations my work here we are in 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:22.530
 arm 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.750
 Good thing you can say for my 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.419
 My design experience does not exist 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.190
 a program a correct workbook 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.320
 you should follow if you will follow 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.060
 It's good that you also adapt to 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:36.270
 training that muscle in a way 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.640
 more like it or not, otherwise you will not 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.730
 inequality of training for the 

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:44.040
 other if you want to train for periods 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:45.900
 so the correct specific training I 

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.540
 I advise you are always trying 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.470
 increase load and not increase from four to 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:52.440
 six weeks 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:54.110
 and the program that this plug 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.340
 training 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:58.560
 we got to the end of one more ask the 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.370
 Great monster, the questions are 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.160
 loving 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.720
 Thank God I do not know if you all 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:06.390
 are merely selecting bands 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:08.310
 good or if you guys frangolino really 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:11.040
 now a year after mogi factory 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.410
 are suddenly fucking evolving you 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:15.860
 they really evolve and I suddenly did 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.090
 some of it suddenly I can be 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.220
 subsidized so not near my 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.510
 his hand is monster you are the very face 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.590
 Thank you for changing my life, that's all. 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.210
 that I want you to be 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:26.690
 God bless you a hug, show your 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.690
 friend the end 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:41.150
 oh or
