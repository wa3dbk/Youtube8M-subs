00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:10.170
 Good day to all, Roman Karpuhin 

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:13.320
 on our website 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.690
 we ourselves have such information that 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.750
 well drilling can be earned up to 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.560
 200 thousand rubles a month and I assure you 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.050
 that this is not the limit 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.060
 so this information causes 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.460
 distrust and smile in some people and 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.410
 even my comrades who have their own 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.900
 eyes see everything as it happens 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.550
 drilling season but still in the heads 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.850
 it is hard to fit and simpler it is not 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.550
 believe and this is bad as if it is not 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.789
 you believe that and it will not be clear that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.350
 This amount varies but it is real and 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:46.199
 today we will talk about why she 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.409
 Itâ€™s going to take the prime minister for 15 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:52.230
 meter well and cost 200 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:56.010
 thousand rubles plus minus depending on 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.170
 region and the price of such a well 15 18 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.569
 thousand rubles and we will be for convenience 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:05.520
 consider it worth 15 thousand rubles and 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:08.160
 so 15,000 subtract the cost price 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:11.970
 a display of a thousand rubles and we also read 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:15.420
 500 rubles for gasoline we get 12 thousand 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.850
 2000 rubles is the salary of an assistant or 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.860
 helpers at your discretion clean 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.470
 which remains 10,000 rubles 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:26.730
 earned three to four hours a day 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.920
 you can do these wells for 2 of us 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:31.230
 there was a case in a day we made five 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.460
 wells but it was all once for 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:39.090
 eight years old but two or three wells a season 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:42.930
 do in a month and 30 31 days and 30 days 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.640
 I think that 2025 wells do no 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.280
 no problem and working with 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.880
 weekends from here and add up this 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:52.680
 the amount of 200 250 thousand per month is not 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.590
 a fairy tale and the real thing 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.740
 were it I considered taking into account the 15-meter 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.530
 wells and wells there are both 25 and 35 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.810
 meters depending on location 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.600
 such stained glass windows and the final amount per month 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.670
 increasing sure one hundred percent that 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.469
 spent 20-30 thousand rubles 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.740
 equipment that is necessary for 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:14.870
 drilling and manual 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.420
 not such an impressive amount compared 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.430
 so what do you get on exit on 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.350
 all words just see the objection right away 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.780
 Believe not only in words but also on 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.210
 In fact, everything is also achievable and achievable. 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.750
 it all depends on you have to take and 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.270
 do 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.790
 take and do and not throw if something 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.680
 failed in the first stages but how 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.610
 rule nobody does 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.170
 limited to constant excuses and 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.050
 some fears that he has 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.570
 it will not work and it is him 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.720
 drilling will fall stone or he will drop 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.320
 rods borehole though in fact this may 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.390
 not happen 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:53.480
 never because you don't even try 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.200
 do it and if that happens 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.400
 we solve all these moments and are not lethal 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.190
