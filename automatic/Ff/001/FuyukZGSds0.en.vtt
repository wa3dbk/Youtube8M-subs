you<00:01:07.770> will<00:01:07.950> first<00:01:08.370> remove<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:09.000> for<00:01:09.630> pulling

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
you will first remove this for pulling

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.830 
you will first remove this for pulling
it<00:01:10.110> out<00:01:10.230> so<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:11.460> then<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:12.120> is<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.479> power

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
it out so and then this is the power

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.620 
it out so and then this is the power
supply<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:14.070> gives<00:01:14.340> power<00:01:14.550> from<00:01:14.910> using<00:01:15.270> this

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
supply it gives power from using this

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.650 
supply it gives power from using this
and<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.860> pull<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:17.160> out<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.729> disconnect

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
and you pull this out and disconnect

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.960 
and you pull this out and disconnect
this<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.770> would<00:01:20.130> take<00:01:20.370> these<00:01:20.610> green

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
this and then you would take these green

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:29.780 
this and then you would take these green
tabs<00:01:21.630> and<00:01:21.930> pull<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.140> out<00:01:28.130> to<00:01:29.130> remove<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.580> hard

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
tabs and pull it out to remove the hard

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.390 
tabs and pull it out to remove the hard
drive<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.240> would<00:01:30.330> also<00:01:30.450> do<00:01:30.690> the<00:01:30.810> same<00:01:30.840> thing

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.410

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
now i'm going to talk about the power

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.590 
now i'm going to talk about the power
supply<00:01:37.850> the<00:01:38.850> power<00:01:38.970> supply<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.330> this

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
supply the power supply and this

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.749 
supply the power supply and this
computer<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:39.990> actually<00:01:40.590> under<00:01:40.830> this<00:01:41.189> this<00:01:41.640> is

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
computer is actually under this this is

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.609 
computer is actually under this this is
called<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.970> riser<00:01:42.150> card<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:43.200> what<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.380> do<00:01:43.500> is

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
called a riser card and what you do is

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.499 
called a riser card and what you do is
you<00:01:43.710> pull<00:01:44.009> out<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.280> riser<00:01:44.460> card<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:45.390> by

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
you pull out the riser card just by

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.410 
you pull out the riser card just by
lifting<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.110> tab<00:01:46.830> up<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.210> where<00:01:48.330> you

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
lifting the tab up and this is where you

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.460 
lifting the tab up and this is where you
hold<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> base<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:48.990> we'll<00:01:49.110> talk<00:01:49.229> about<00:01:49.290> a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
hold the base but we'll talk about a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.219 
hold the base but we'll talk about a
little<00:01:49.590> later<00:01:50.780> this<00:01:51.780> right<00:01:51.960> here<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.140> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
little later this right here is the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.830 
little later this right here is the
actual<00:01:52.500> power<00:01:52.860> supply<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.420> fan<00:01:54.659> on

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
actual power supply the we have a fan on

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.139 
actual power supply the we have a fan on
it<00:01:54.960> because<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.619> supplying<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.549> lot<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.880> power

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
it because it's supplying a lot of power

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.910 
it because it's supplying a lot of power
and<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.600> lot<00:01:57.630> of<00:01:57.750> voltage<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.289> it<00:01:58.350> gets<00:01:58.440> very<00:01:58.560> hot

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
and a lot of voltage so it gets very hot

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.249 
and a lot of voltage so it gets very hot
very<00:01:59.159> fast<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.729> the<00:02:00.390> fan<00:02:00.600> takes<00:02:00.810> away<00:02:01.049> at<00:02:01.110> some

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
very fast and the fan takes away at some

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.289 
very fast and the fan takes away at some
of<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.380> heat<00:02:01.560> see<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:02.580> these<00:02:02.700> cables<00:02:03.090> all

alright<00:02:15.720> so<00:02:15.960> now<00:02:16.080> we're<00:02:16.230> going<00:02:16.320> to<00:02:16.380> talk<00:02:16.560> about

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
alright so now we're going to talk about

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.280 
alright so now we're going to talk about
the<00:02:16.770> motherboard<00:02:17.400> which<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.330> located<00:02:18.630> right

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
the motherboard which is located right

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.870 
the motherboard which is located right
here<00:02:20.060> alright<00:02:21.060> first<00:02:21.330> off<00:02:21.570> the<00:02:22.170> motherboard

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
here alright first off the motherboard

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.610 
here alright first off the motherboard
contains<00:02:23.880> a<00:02:24.030> plethora<00:02:24.510> of<00:02:24.630> resistors<00:02:25.260> which

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
contains a plethora of resistors which

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.050 
contains a plethora of resistors which
are<00:02:25.950> these<00:02:26.070> little<00:02:26.220> metal<00:02:26.520> things<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:26.970> just

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
are these little metal things I just

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:28.940 
are these little metal things I just
spread<00:02:27.390> out<00:02:27.510> all<00:02:27.690> over<00:02:27.720> these<00:02:28.590> black<00:02:28.920> things

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
spread out all over these black things

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.620 
spread out all over these black things
would<00:02:29.370> be<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.550> capacité<00:02:30.270> terse<00:02:30.420> which

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
would be the capacité terse which

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.050 
would be the capacité terse which
regulate<00:02:31.320> the<00:02:31.500> voltage<00:02:31.650> because<00:02:32.490> if<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:32.940> have

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
regulate the voltage because if you have

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.630 
regulate the voltage because if you have
an<00:02:33.120> uneven<00:02:33.420> voltage<00:02:33.990> bad<00:02:34.890> things<00:02:35.250> happen<00:02:35.580> to

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
an uneven voltage bad things happen to

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.080 
an uneven voltage bad things happen to
the<00:02:35.760> motherboard<00:02:36.090> like<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:37.530> crashes<00:02:38.090> here's

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
the motherboard like it crashes here's

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.540 
the motherboard like it crashes here's
the<00:02:39.240> battery<00:02:39.630> which<00:02:39.810> will<00:02:40.080> save<00:02:40.550> things

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
the battery which will save things

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.090 
the battery which will save things
wallace<00:02:42.090> turned<00:02:42.360> off<00:02:42.570> it's<00:02:43.050> pretty<00:02:43.860> low

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
wallace turned off it's pretty low

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.390 
wallace turned off it's pretty low
voltage<00:02:44.610> so<00:02:44.820> it<00:02:44.880> doesn't<00:02:45.120> take<00:02:45.270> up<00:02:45.300> too<00:02:45.450> much

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
voltage so it doesn't take up too much

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.160 
voltage so it doesn't take up too much
the<00:02:47.400> bios<00:02:47.880> which<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.330> basic<00:02:48.660> input<00:02:49.050> and

fifty dollars the motherboard itself has

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.930 
fifty dollars the motherboard itself has
these<00:03:39.410> resistors<00:03:40.410> but<00:03:40.890> they're<00:03:41.040> like<00:03:41.310> seven

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
these resistors but they're like seven

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.550 
these resistors but they're like seven
different<00:03:42.090> levels<00:03:42.660> on<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.959> motherboard<00:03:43.230> so

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
different levels on the motherboard so

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.770 
different levels on the motherboard so
it's<00:03:43.709> just<00:03:43.890> this<00:03:44.150> complex<00:03:45.150> chain<00:03:45.600> of

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
it's just this complex chain of

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.380 
it's just this complex chain of
resistors<00:03:46.290> that<00:03:46.410> goes<00:03:46.650> all<00:03:46.830> over<00:03:46.860> the<00:03:47.100> place

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:47.390 
resistors that goes all over the place

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:50.780 
resistors that goes all over the place

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
the north and south bridges control data

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.170 
the north and south bridges control data
processing<00:03:51.480> in<00:03:51.600> the<00:03:51.690> motherboard<00:03:52.170> and<00:03:53.180> the

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
processing in the motherboard and the

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.620 
processing in the motherboard and the
bios<00:03:54.769> sort<00:03:55.769> of<00:03:55.920> just<00:03:56.280> gives<00:03:56.519> the<00:03:56.880> start<00:03:57.540> of

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
bios sort of just gives the start of

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.900 
bios sort of just gives the start of
structions<00:03:58.110> for<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.470> computer<00:03:58.950> so<00:03:59.760> it's

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
structions for the computer so it's

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:07.100 
structions for the computer so it's
basically<00:04:00.090> like<00:04:00.570> ro<00:04:01.260> M<00:04:01.739> it<00:04:02.070> can't<00:04:02.370> be<00:04:02.459> changed

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.410 

this<00:04:07.320> is<00:04:07.440> the<00:04:07.560> fan<00:04:07.860> that<00:04:08.190> cools<00:04:08.730> off<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.210> cpu

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
this is the fan that cools off the cpu

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.530 
this is the fan that cools off the cpu
which<00:04:10.050> gets<00:04:10.290> really<00:04:10.560> hot<00:04:10.740> really<00:04:10.980> quickly<00:04:11.540> the

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
which gets really hot really quickly the

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.940 
which gets really hot really quickly the
cpu<00:04:12.930> is<00:04:13.200> like<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.500> brain<00:04:13.680> of<00:04:13.710> the<00:04:13.860> computer

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
cpu is like the brain of the computer

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.940 
cpu is like the brain of the computer
and<00:04:14.610> to<00:04:14.760> remove<00:04:15.030> the<00:04:15.270> fan<00:04:15.510> who<00:04:15.990> would<00:04:16.170> lift

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
and to remove the fan who would lift

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.009 
and to remove the fan who would lift
this<00:04:17.130> lever<00:04:17.400> up<00:04:17.609> and<00:04:17.850> pull<00:04:18.420> it<00:04:18.570> out<00:04:18.690> and

this lever up and pull it out and

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:24.170 
this lever up and pull it out and
disconnect<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.280> quarry<00:04:22.880> you<00:04:23.880> can<00:04:24.030> also

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
disconnect the quarry you can also

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.210 
disconnect the quarry you can also
remove<00:04:24.540> the<00:04:24.690> CPU<00:04:25.170> by<00:04:25.440> lifting<00:04:25.740> up<00:04:25.890> the<00:04:26.010> flower

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
remove the CPU by lifting up the flower

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:34.700 
remove the CPU by lifting up the flower
and<00:04:31.700> pulling<00:04:32.700> out<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:32.970> CPU<00:04:33.440> it's<00:04:34.440> very

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
and pulling out the CPU it's very

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:37.040 
and pulling out the CPU it's very
delicate<00:04:35.000> see<00:04:36.000> all<00:04:36.120> these<00:04:36.210> little<00:04:36.390> needles<00:04:36.840> if

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
delicate see all these little needles if

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.540 
delicate see all these little needles if
one<00:04:37.290> breaks<00:04:37.500> then<00:04:37.890> you<00:04:37.980> need<00:04:38.130> to<00:04:38.250> get<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.430> new

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:38.550 
one breaks then you need to get a new

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.300 
one breaks then you need to get a new
one<00:04:38.790> to<00:04:39.690> put<00:04:39.840> the<00:04:39.990> CPU<00:04:40.470> back<00:04:40.680> you<00:04:40.950> have<00:04:41.040> to<00:04:41.190> line

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
one to put the CPU back you have to line

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.540 
one to put the CPU back you have to line
up<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:41.610> little<00:04:41.910> triangle<00:04:42.390> here<00:04:43.250> with<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.370> top

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550 
up a little triangle here with the top

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.460 
up a little triangle here with the top
of<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.850> corner<00:04:45.180> here<00:04:45.210> and<00:04:45.990> you<00:04:46.080> have<00:04:46.169> to<00:04:46.320> put

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:46.470 
of the corner here and you have to put

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.870 
of the corner here and you have to put
all<00:04:46.590> little<00:04:46.919> needles<00:04:47.190> in<00:04:47.310> the<00:04:47.430> hole<00:04:47.580> and<00:04:47.820> you

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
all little needles in the hole and you

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.100 
all little needles in the hole and you
put<00:04:48.150> the<00:04:48.270> lever<00:04:48.450> backed<00:04:48.810> up

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.330 

hi<00:04:55.110> now<00:04:55.440> we're<00:04:55.560> going<00:04:55.650> to<00:04:55.710> talk<00:04:55.830> about<00:04:55.980> Ram

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
hi now we're going to talk about Ram

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.940 
hi now we're going to talk about Ram
let's<00:04:56.700> random<00:04:57.240> access<00:04:57.570> memory<00:04:57.960> so<00:04:58.680> basically

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
let's random access memory so basically

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.080 
let's random access memory so basically
whenever<00:04:59.250> you're<00:04:59.400> running<00:04:59.580> an<00:04:59.970> application

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
whenever you're running an application

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.659 
whenever you're running an application
or<00:05:00.600> you're<00:05:01.080> saving<00:05:01.380> board<00:05:01.590> document<00:05:02.010> for<00:05:02.580> the

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
or you're saving board document for the

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.820 
or you're saving board document for the
time<00:05:02.850> being<00:05:03.060> and<00:05:03.210> saved<00:05:03.419> on<00:05:03.570> your<00:05:03.600> back<00:05:03.840> now

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
time being and saved on your back now

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.320 
time being and saved on your back now
the<00:05:04.889> Rams<00:05:05.130> located<00:05:05.669> here<00:05:05.910> on<00:05:05.940> the<00:05:06.090> motherboard

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
the Rams located here on the motherboard

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.840 
the Rams located here on the motherboard
it's<00:05:07.320> the<00:05:07.530> stick<00:05:07.770> right<00:05:07.800> here<00:05:07.980> now<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.520> pop<00:05:08.700> it

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
it's the stick right here now to pop it

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:10.640 
it's the stick right here now to pop it
out<00:05:08.910> you<00:05:09.060> just<00:05:09.150> pull<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.480> two<00:05:09.630> tabs<00:05:09.840> kind<00:05:10.560> of

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
out you just pull the two tabs kind of

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.210 
out you just pull the two tabs kind of
pops<00:05:10.950> right<00:05:11.130> out<00:05:11.870> now<00:05:12.870> this<00:05:13.740> is<00:05:13.800> an<00:05:14.010> older

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
pops right out now this is an older

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.480 
pops right out now this is an older
model<00:05:14.370> of<00:05:14.580> RAM<00:05:14.790> but<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.570> newer<00:05:15.720> ones<00:05:16.020> have

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
model of RAM but the newer ones have

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.600 
model of RAM but the newer ones have
more<00:05:17.490> of<00:05:17.610> these<00:05:17.700> little<00:05:19.070> spikes<00:05:20.070> there<00:05:20.370> and

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
more of these little spikes there and

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.510 
more of these little spikes there and
then<00:05:21.240> don't<00:05:21.660> normally<00:05:21.990> have<00:05:22.200> or<00:05:23.130> they<00:05:23.310> cannot

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
then don't normally have or they cannot

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.170 
then don't normally have or they cannot
have<00:05:23.910> these<00:05:24.450> chips<00:05:24.930> on<00:05:25.050> the<00:05:25.110> back<00:05:25.610> now<00:05:26.610> Rams

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:27.180 
have these chips on the back now Rams

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:28.430 
have these chips on the back now Rams
can<00:05:27.360> be<00:05:27.450> replaceable<00:05:27.870> but<00:05:28.080> you<00:05:28.169> just<00:05:28.260> got<00:05:28.380> to

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
can be replaceable but you just got to

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:30.440 
can be replaceable but you just got to
make<00:05:28.590> sure<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:29.010> RAM<00:05:29.190> matches<00:05:30.030> up<00:05:30.180> with<00:05:30.300> the

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:30.450 
make sure the RAM matches up with the

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:32.659 
make sure the RAM matches up with the
model<00:05:31.020> you<00:05:31.110> have<00:05:31.290> and<00:05:31.590> so<00:05:31.740> if<00:05:32.190> you<00:05:32.430> can<00:05:32.550> see

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:32.669 
model you have and so if you can see

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.140 
model you have and so if you can see
that<00:05:32.820> number<00:05:32.970> out<00:05:33.210> there<00:05:33.389> that's<00:05:34.169> matches<00:05:35.010> the

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:35.150 
that number out there that's matches the

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.430 
that number out there that's matches the
model<00:05:36.150> Ram<00:05:36.419> that<00:05:36.570> you<00:05:36.660> need<00:05:37.070> right<00:05:38.070> cool<00:05:38.400> oh

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
model Ram that you need right cool oh

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.250 
model Ram that you need right cool oh
and<00:05:40.440> you<00:05:40.560> pop<00:05:40.830> it<00:05:40.979> back<00:05:41.010> in<00:05:41.250> just<00:05:41.370> by<00:05:42.169> lining<00:05:43.169> up

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
and you pop it back in just by lining up

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:46.219 
and you pop it back in just by lining up
the<00:05:43.639> voice<00:05:44.639> of<00:05:44.850> the<00:05:44.880> ridges<00:05:45.180> it<00:05:45.720> kind<00:05:45.930> of<00:05:45.990> helps

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
the voice of the ridges it kind of helps

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.840 
the voice of the ridges it kind of helps
if<00:05:46.320> you<00:05:46.440> have<00:05:46.590> everything<00:05:47.010> wide<00:05:47.280> open<00:05:47.550> so<00:05:47.639> then

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:47.850 
if you have everything wide open so then

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:54.360 
if you have everything wide open so then
you<00:05:47.910> can<00:05:48.030> just<00:05:48.530> pop<00:05:49.530> back<00:05:49.710> end

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.830 

alright<00:05:54.940> so<00:05:55.060> now<00:05:55.180> we're<00:05:55.300> going<00:05:55.389> to<00:05:55.449> talk<00:05:55.690> about

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
alright so now we're going to talk about

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.230 
alright so now we're going to talk about
the<00:05:56.080> rise<00:05:56.260> of<00:05:56.290> our<00:05:56.650> would<00:05:57.430> you<00:05:57.580> just<00:05:57.729> pull<00:05:58.060> up

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
the rise of our would you just pull up

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.000 
the rise of our would you just pull up
as<00:05:58.419> we<00:05:58.750> should<00:05:59.050> I<00:05:59.260> left<00:05:59.500> hang<00:05:59.680> up<00:05:59.800> the<00:05:59.919> gloves

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:00.010 
as we should I left hang up the gloves

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.990 
as we should I left hang up the gloves
are<00:06:00.220> just<00:06:00.790> doing<00:06:01.780> its<00:06:02.050> lights<00:06:02.380> pull<00:06:03.000> alright

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:04.000 
are just doing its lights pull alright

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.360 
are just doing its lights pull alright
so<00:06:04.240> most<00:06:04.840> new<00:06:05.260> computers<00:06:05.710> will<00:06:05.889> not<00:06:06.010> have<00:06:06.220> the

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370 
so most new computers will not have the

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.370 
so most new computers will not have the
riser<00:06:06.580> card<00:06:06.850> and<00:06:07.180> for<00:06:07.570> this<00:06:07.660> older<00:06:08.050> version

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
riser card and for this older version

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.090 
riser card and for this older version
though<00:06:08.820> it<00:06:09.820> would<00:06:10.000> function<00:06:10.270> as<00:06:10.889> where<00:06:11.889> you

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:12.100 
though it would function as where you

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.070 
though it would function as where you
would<00:06:12.220> put<00:06:12.430> your<00:06:12.639> expansions<00:06:13.389> such<00:06:13.630> as<00:06:13.780> memory

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 
would put your expansions such as memory

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.110 
would put your expansions such as memory
I<00:06:14.470> mean<00:06:14.830> not<00:06:14.860> member<00:06:15.220> I'm<00:06:15.310> sorry<00:06:15.550> video

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 
I mean not member I'm sorry video

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:19.620 
I mean not member I'm sorry video
expansion<00:06:17.050> and<00:06:17.260> video<00:06:17.770> expansion<00:06:18.370> and<00:06:18.639> sound

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
expansion and video expansion and sound

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.710 
expansion and video expansion and sound
expansion<00:06:20.940> so<00:06:21.940> that's<00:06:22.060> basically<00:06:22.210> just<00:06:22.600> the

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 
expansion so that's basically just the

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:33.110 
expansion so that's basically just the
function<00:06:23.050> the<00:06:23.110> rising<00:06:23.440> card<00:06:23.830> the<00:06:24.520> card

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.180 

you
