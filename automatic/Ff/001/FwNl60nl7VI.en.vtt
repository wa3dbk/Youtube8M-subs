00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
to find the coordinates of where having

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.680 
to find the coordinates of where having
that<00:03:57.620> if<00:03:57.800> I<00:03:58.130> can't<00:03:58.640> provide<00:03:59.090> the<00:03:59.270> cordon<00:03:59.570> so

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
they just will be down there

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.410 
they just will be down there
