example here and as soon as you pick
sunset<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:56.460> clock<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:57.600> goes<00:00:57.930> into<00:00:57.960> this

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
sunset the clock then goes into this

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.990 
sunset the clock then goes into this
state<00:00:58.649> where<00:00:58.859> it<00:00:58.949> actually<00:00:59.100> shows<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> Setting

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
state where it actually shows a Setting

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.060 
state where it actually shows a Setting
Sun<00:01:00.030> now<00:01:00.510> if<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> started<00:01:01.469> to<00:01:01.559> see<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> sunset

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
Sun now if you started to see a sunset

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.090 
Sun now if you started to see a sunset
on<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.489> server<00:01:02.840> then<00:01:03.840> that<00:01:04.350> would<00:01:04.530> be<00:01:04.559> synced

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
on the server then that would be synced

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.090 
on the server then that would be synced
up<00:01:05.189> with<00:01:05.250> this<00:01:05.729> right<00:01:06.060> now<00:01:06.210> so<00:01:06.860> sunsets<00:01:07.860> last

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
up with this right now so sunsets last

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.160 
up with this right now so sunsets last
about<00:01:08.430> 90<00:01:08.729> seconds<00:01:09.210> which<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> good

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
about 90 seconds which is a good

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.100 
about 90 seconds which is a good
interval<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.860> which<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.250> time<00:01:11.810> when<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.900> start

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
interval in which to time when to start

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.219 
interval in which to time when to start
the<00:01:13.290> clock<00:01:13.500> at<00:01:14.450> now<00:01:15.450> bear<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.840> mind<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.170> is

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
the clock at now bear in mind this is

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.870 
the clock at now bear in mind this is
not<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.950> final<00:01:17.130> design<00:01:17.400> we're<00:01:17.729> actually

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
not the the final design we're actually

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.300 
not the the final design we're actually
working<00:01:18.119> on<00:01:18.420> right<00:01:18.570> now<00:01:18.600> on<00:01:18.750> making<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.740> version

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
working on right now on making a version

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.289 
working on right now on making a version
of<00:01:20.369> the<00:01:20.490> clock<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.939> will<00:01:21.119> look<00:01:21.390> at<00:01:22.220> exactly

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
of the clock that will look at exactly

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.480 
of the clock that will look at exactly
what<00:01:24.299> time<00:01:24.780> your<00:01:25.229> particular<00:01:25.770> server<00:01:26.100> is

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
what time your particular server is

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.940 
what time your particular server is
running<00:01:27.090> so<00:01:27.900> it<00:01:28.140> will<00:01:28.259> check<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.680> server

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
running so it will check the server

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.920 
running so it will check the server
based<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> URL<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.119> put<00:01:30.299> in<00:01:30.390> for<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.659> server

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
based on a URL you put in for the server

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.800 
based on a URL you put in for the server
or<00:01:31.170> IP<00:01:31.530> address<00:01:32.040> and<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:33.210> will<00:01:33.299> take<00:01:33.509> that

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
or IP address and it will take that

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.130 
or IP address and it will take that
value<00:01:34.170> instead<00:01:35.090> and<00:01:36.090> here<00:01:36.509> we<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.750> start<00:01:36.990> to

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
value instead and here we can start to

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.620 
value instead and here we can start to
see<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.409> believe<00:01:37.650> it's<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.159> moon<00:01:38.340> is<00:01:39.000> coming<00:01:39.390> up

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
see I believe it's the moon is coming up

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.039 
see I believe it's the moon is coming up
on<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.920> horizon<00:01:41.100> so<00:01:42.090> we<00:01:42.210> kind<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.479> get<00:01:42.630> a<00:01:42.689> nice

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
on the horizon so we kind of get a nice

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.310 
on the horizon so we kind of get a nice
little<00:01:43.259> general<00:01:43.920> visual<00:01:44.750> concept<00:01:45.750> of<00:01:45.930> exactly

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
little general visual concept of exactly

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.889 
little general visual concept of exactly
what's<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.799> on<00:01:47.240> go<00:01:48.240> ahead<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.659> maximize

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
what's going on go ahead and maximize

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.550 
what's going on go ahead and maximize
the<00:01:49.340> page

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
the page

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.819 
the page
so<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:52.220> can<00:01:52.340> see<00:01:52.549> all<00:01:52.579> of<00:01:52.729> it<00:01:54.700> all<00:01:55.700> right<00:01:56.829> so

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
so you can see all of it all right so

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.130 
so you can see all of it all right so
that<00:01:57.950> moon<00:01:58.159> is<00:01:58.189> starting<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.820> come<00:01:58.939> up<00:01:59.000> and<00:01:59.329> as

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
that moon is starting to come up and as

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.889 
that moon is starting to come up and as
soon<00:02:00.380> as<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.710> white<00:02:01.009> bar<00:02:01.369> reaches<00:02:02.210> the<00:02:02.720> end

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:02.899 
soon as that white bar reaches the end

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.710 
soon as that white bar reaches the end
it<00:02:03.259> will<00:02:03.409> be<00:02:03.560> night<00:02:03.890> time<00:02:04.539> so<00:02:05.539> that's

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
it will be night time so that's

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.199 
it will be night time so that's
basically<00:02:05.899> how<00:02:06.200> the<00:02:06.350> clock<00:02:06.649> works<00:02:07.009> and<00:02:07.430> of

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.209 
basically how the clock works and of

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:09.400 
basically how the clock works and of
course<00:02:08.450> there's<00:02:08.690> a<00:02:08.780> little<00:02:08.929> thing<00:02:09.200> they're

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
course there's a little thing they're

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.589 
course there's a little thing they're
just<00:02:09.649> letting<00:02:10.039> you<00:02:10.190> know<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.369> always<00:02:11.300> be<00:02:11.480> aware

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
just letting you know to always be aware

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.479 
just letting you know to always be aware
of<00:02:11.780> creepers<00:02:12.349> especially<00:02:13.160> in<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.310> dark

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
of creepers especially in the dark

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:17.259 
of creepers especially in the dark
though<00:02:14.300> this<00:02:14.480> us<00:02:15.170> this<00:02:15.860> works<00:02:16.099> very<00:02:16.400> well<00:02:16.489> when

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
though this us this works very well when

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:18.370 
though this us this works very well when
you're<00:02:17.420> in<00:02:17.510> the<00:02:17.599> dark<00:02:17.780> for<00:02:18.019> instance<00:02:18.290> if

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:18.380 
you're in the dark for instance if

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.800 
you're in the dark for instance if
you're<00:02:18.500> underground<00:02:18.890> or<00:02:19.400> you're<00:02:19.940> needing<00:02:20.660> to

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
you're underground or you're needing to

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.390 
you're underground or you're needing to
know<00:02:20.840> what<00:02:21.080> time<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:21.410> is<00:02:21.440> above<00:02:21.769> surface<00:02:22.250> to

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
know what time it is above surface to

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.850 
know what time it is above surface to
resurface<00:02:22.780> that<00:02:23.780> sort<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.019> thing<00:02:24.110> you'll<00:02:24.709> now

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
resurface that sort of thing you'll now

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:26.949 
resurface that sort of thing you'll now
know<00:02:25.069> when<00:02:25.280> it's<00:02:25.430> safe<00:02:25.640> to<00:02:25.910> go<00:02:26.330> out<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.750> hiding

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
know when it's safe to go out of hiding

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.350 
know when it's safe to go out of hiding
or<00:02:27.260> whatnot<00:02:27.620> so<00:02:28.010> there's<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.760> lot<00:02:28.880> of<00:02:28.940> uses<00:02:29.180> for

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
or whatnot so there's a lot of uses for

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.600 
or whatnot so there's a lot of uses for
the<00:02:29.630> clock<00:02:30.010> plus<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.130> just<00:02:31.310> a<00:02:31.400> fun<00:02:31.580> little

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
the clock plus is just a fun little

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.280 
the clock plus is just a fun little
visual<00:02:32.000> thing<00:02:32.330> to<00:02:32.450> have<00:02:32.630> it<00:02:32.810> runs<00:02:32.959> at<00:02:33.110> eight

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
visual thing to have it runs at eight

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.500 
visual thing to have it runs at eight
frames<00:02:33.620> per<00:02:33.950> second<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.580> the<00:02:35.090> reason<00:02:35.299> I<00:02:35.330> chose

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
frames per second and the reason I chose

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.180 
frames per second and the reason I chose
to<00:02:35.660> do<00:02:35.750> that<00:02:35.900> is<00:02:36.019> because<00:02:36.200> it's<00:02:36.470> less<00:02:36.650> taxing

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
to do that is because it's less taxing

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.039 
to do that is because it's less taxing
on<00:02:37.250> your<00:02:37.280> video<00:02:37.700> card<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.330> if<00:02:38.540> you're<00:02:38.959> running

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
on your video card so if you're running

you're playing Minecraft on it you can

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:44.589 
you're playing Minecraft on it you can
also<00:02:42.739> run<00:02:43.099> this<00:02:43.250> clock<00:02:43.580> along<00:02:43.910> cited<00:02:44.390> and<00:02:44.510> it's

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
also run this clock along cited and it's

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.509 
also run this clock along cited and it's
not<00:02:44.750> going<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.080> hurt<00:02:45.680> your<00:02:45.920> minecraft

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
got a weird graphics card that can only

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.690 
got a weird graphics card that can only
display<00:02:50.900> one<00:02:51.319> type<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.560> FPS<00:02:52.190> at<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.430> time

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
display one type of FPS at a time

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.930 
display one type of FPS at a time
between<00:02:53.480> flash<00:02:54.019> and<00:02:54.260> JavaScript<00:02:54.830> anyway<00:02:55.549> so

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
between flash and JavaScript anyway so

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.310 
between flash and JavaScript anyway so
as<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.090> can<00:02:56.209> see<00:02:56.450> now<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.690> clock<00:02:56.959> is<00:02:57.019> turned

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:57.320 
as you can see now the clock is turned

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.710 
as you can see now the clock is turned
to<00:02:57.530> night<00:02:57.709> time<00:02:58.010> and<00:02:58.340> we<00:02:58.970> see<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.299> little<00:02:59.450> moon

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
to night time and we see the little moon

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.270 
to night time and we see the little moon
rising<00:03:00.230> up<00:03:00.350> and<00:03:00.470> it's<00:03:00.620> going<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:00.890> do<00:03:00.980> that<00:03:01.100> for

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:01.280 
rising up and it's going to do that for

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.620 
rising up and it's going to do that for
10<00:03:01.549> straight<00:03:01.820> minutes<00:03:02.120> I'm<00:03:02.329> not<00:03:02.450> going<00:03:02.570> to

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
10 straight minutes I'm not going to

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.150 
10 straight minutes I'm not going to
make<00:03:02.720> you<00:03:02.780> just<00:03:03.049> sit<00:03:03.260> here<00:03:03.380> for<00:03:03.440> 10<00:03:03.769> minutes<00:03:03.799> of

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
make you just sit here for 10 minutes of

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.729 
make you just sit here for 10 minutes of
course<00:03:04.370> and<00:03:04.549> watch<00:03:04.670> that<00:03:04.910> happen<00:03:05.170> so<00:03:06.170> we're

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
course and watch that happen so we're

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.440 
course and watch that happen so we're
just<00:03:06.769> going<00:03:07.040> to<00:03:07.130> go<00:03:07.220> ahead<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.549> cut<00:03:07.609> ahead<00:03:07.850> and

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
just going to go ahead and cut ahead and

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.660 
just going to go ahead and cut ahead and
as<00:03:09.410> you<00:03:09.470> can<00:03:09.590> see<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.859> moon<00:03:10.040> then<00:03:10.220> turns<00:03:10.430> into

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
as you can see the moon then turns into

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.569 
as you can see the moon then turns into
that<00:03:11.090> for<00:03:11.840> the<00:03:11.930> sunset<00:03:12.440> whoopsie<00:03:12.920> Daisy<00:03:13.130> I<00:03:13.280> hit

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:13.579 
that for the sunset whoopsie Daisy I hit

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.259 
that for the sunset whoopsie Daisy I hit
the<00:03:13.730> motion<00:03:14.030> n<00:03:14.120> studios<00:03:14.540> button<00:03:15.940> let<00:03:16.940> me<00:03:17.000> back

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
the motion n studios button let me back

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.900 
the motion n studios button let me back
out<00:03:17.450> oh<00:03:17.750> it<00:03:18.680> creates<00:03:19.040> a<00:03:19.100> new<00:03:19.220> tab<00:03:19.459> that's<00:03:19.730> right

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
out oh it creates a new tab that's right

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.160 
out oh it creates a new tab that's right
it<00:03:20.000> doesn't<00:03:20.150> actually<00:03:20.359> close<00:03:20.720> the<00:03:20.930> clock

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
it doesn't actually close the clock

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.960 
it doesn't actually close the clock
we're<00:03:21.950> still<00:03:22.100> working<00:03:22.280> on<00:03:22.579> this<00:03:22.730> right<00:03:22.940> now

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
we're still working on this right now

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:24.970 
we're still working on this right now
this<00:03:23.540> is<00:03:23.690> just<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.930> very<00:03:23.959> quick<00:03:24.170> prototype<00:03:24.590> I

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
this is just a very quick prototype I

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.530 
this is just a very quick prototype I
put<00:03:25.160> together<00:03:25.250> in<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.549> few<00:03:25.730> minutes<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.180> iphone

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
put together in a few minutes the iphone

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.270 
put together in a few minutes the iphone
version<00:03:26.930> is<00:03:27.109> going<00:03:27.769> to<00:03:27.829> be<00:03:27.889> actually<00:03:28.130> to<00:03:28.250> be

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
version is going to be actually to be

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.729 
version is going to be actually to be
tied<00:03:28.670> to<00:03:28.880> your<00:03:28.970> iPhone's<00:03:29.389> clock<00:03:29.840> so<00:03:30.200> once

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
tied to your iPhone's clock so once

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:33.520 
tied to your iPhone's clock so once
you've<00:03:30.920> set<00:03:31.130> your<00:03:31.220> clock<00:03:31.540> it<00:03:32.540> should<00:03:33.200> work

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
you've set your clock it should work

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:35.470 
you've set your clock it should work
even<00:03:34.160> if<00:03:34.280> you<00:03:34.400> leave<00:03:34.639> the<00:03:34.819> server<00:03:35.030> for<00:03:35.299> a<00:03:35.329> while
