00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
actually got 86 pays 68 shooting is 71

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.979 
actually got 86 pays 68 shooting is 71
passing<00:00:35.760> and<00:00:35.910> also<00:00:36.120> simply<00:00:36.450> six<00:00:36.630> dribbling

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
passing and also simply six dribbling

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.170 
passing and also simply six dribbling
nothing<00:00:37.829> really<00:00:38.129> too<00:00:38.280> crazy<00:00:38.579> on<00:00:38.700> them<00:00:38.910> stats

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
nothing really too crazy on them stats

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.090 
nothing really too crazy on them stats
so<00:00:39.360> far<00:00:39.629> he's<00:00:40.230> actually<00:00:40.410> certainly<00:00:40.800> for<00:00:40.950> red

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
so far he's actually certainly for red

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.069 
so far he's actually certainly for red
card<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:42.000> they<00:00:42.180> actually<00:00:42.239> write<00:00:42.719> forward

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
card and is they actually write forward

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.900 
card and is they actually write forward
so<00:00:43.230> he's<00:00:43.350> not<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> sort<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.340> same<00:00:44.520> position

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
so he's not in the sort of same position

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.940 
so he's not in the sort of same position
as<00:00:45.000> messy<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.600> he<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.840> definitely<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.500> messy

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
as messy but he is definitely a messy

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.160 
as messy but he is definitely a messy
esque<00:00:47.219> player<00:00:47.550> now<00:00:47.730> he's<00:00:48.239> got<00:00:48.420> full<00:00:48.629> week<00:00:48.960> fur

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
and for me that is definitely more like

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.060 
and for me that is definitely more like
a<00:00:51.180> five<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.719> weak<00:00:51.899> foot<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.530> will<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:52.890> some

rock hard shots and he's actually got

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.349 
rock hard shots and he's actually got
three<00:01:02.100> star<00:01:02.340> skill<00:01:02.579> moves<00:01:02.789> which<00:01:03.000> isn't<00:01:03.329> very

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
three star skill moves which isn't very

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.509 
three star skill moves which isn't very
good<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:03.979> personally<00:01:04.979> for<00:01:05.100> me<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.220> kind<00:01:05.489> of

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
good but personally for me I kind of

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.370 
good but personally for me I kind of
prefer<00:01:05.700> it<00:01:06.060> because<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.750> kind<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:06.990> stops<00:01:07.260> you

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
prefer it because it kind of stops you

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.289 
prefer it because it kind of stops you
from<00:01:07.439> using<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:08.040> school<00:01:08.280> moves<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.790> kind<00:01:09.240> of

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
from using the school moves it kind of

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.480 
from using the school moves it kind of
you<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.600> makes<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.530> use<00:01:10.680> like<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.890> bull<00:01:11.220> roll

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
you know makes you use like a bull roll

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.179 
you know makes you use like a bull roll
the<00:01:11.790> step<00:01:12.030> overs<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.479> roulette<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:13.979> kind

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
the step overs the roulette and it kind

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.789 
the step overs the roulette and it kind
of<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.490> makes<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.970> lot<00:01:15.240> more<00:01:15.770> harder<00:01:16.770> and

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
of just makes it a lot more harder and

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.429 
of just makes it a lot more harder and
it<00:01:17.189> kind<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.460> like<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.600> same<00:01:18.780> time<00:01:18.990> hard<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
it kind of like at the same time hard a

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.050 
it kind of like at the same time hard a
bit<00:01:19.590> easier<00:01:19.710> to<00:01:20.130> get<00:01:20.250> through<00:01:20.310> players<00:01:20.759> and

for a silver platter like that's kind of
what<00:03:23.190> implies<00:03:23.549> but<00:03:23.910> this<00:03:24.359> is<00:03:24.510> a<00:03:24.540> little<00:03:24.780> cross

what implies but this is a little cross
from<00:03:25.139> him<00:03:25.290> i<00:03:25.380> thought<00:03:25.530> i'd<00:03:25.650> add<00:03:25.769> that<00:03:25.950> in<00:03:26.069> just

from him i thought i'd add that in just

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.670 
from him i thought i'd add that in just
to<00:03:26.430> show<00:03:26.579> he<00:03:26.700> can<00:03:26.880> cross<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:28.230> ball<00:03:28.410> and<00:03:28.560> stuff

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
of that but i think this was one of the

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.759 
of that but i think this was one of the
goals<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.750> i've<00:03:30.900> talked<00:03:31.200> about<00:03:31.319> which<00:03:31.680> I
