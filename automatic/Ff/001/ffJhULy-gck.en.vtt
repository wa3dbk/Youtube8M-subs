w3<00:00:17.310> that<00:00:17.789> i<00:00:17.820> reviewed<00:00:18.270> last<00:00:18.539> year<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.140> i<00:00:19.920> liked

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
w3 that i reviewed last year and i liked

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.070 
w3 that i reviewed last year and i liked
it<00:00:20.340> as<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> good<00:00:20.820> early<00:00:21.240> example<00:00:21.779> of<00:00:21.810> what<00:00:21.990> you

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
it as a good early example of what you

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.019 
it as a good early example of what you
could<00:00:22.199> do<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.590> an<00:00:22.710> 8-inch<00:00:23.130> tablet<00:00:23.340> windows<00:00:23.850> 8

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
could do in an 8-inch tablet windows 8

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.179 
could do in an 8-inch tablet windows 8
but<00:00:24.330> it<00:00:24.480> really<00:00:24.840> didn't<00:00:25.350> quite<00:00:25.590> hit<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.949> spot

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
but it really didn't quite hit the spot

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.650 
but it really didn't quite hit the spot
and<00:00:26.460> a<00:00:26.519> lot<00:00:26.670> of<00:00:26.760> systems<00:00:27.090> that<00:00:27.210> came<00:00:27.390> out<00:00:27.510> after

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
and a lot of systems that came out after

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.109 
and a lot of systems that came out after
that<00:00:28.140> did<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.769> lot<00:00:29.010> better<00:00:29.039> in<00:00:29.400> terms<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.760> design

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
I love you and the apps that are kind of

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.119 
I love you and the apps that are kind of
custom<00:01:00.239> optimized<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.289> what<00:01:01.890> really

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
custom optimized for that what really

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.759 
custom optimized for that what really
helps<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.520> w4<00:01:03.210> stand<00:01:03.539> out<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.409> you<00:01:04.559> get

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
helps this w4 stand out is that you get

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.700 
helps this w4 stand out is that you get
a<00:01:04.799> 64<00:01:05.580> gig<00:01:05.610> SSD<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.510> that's<00:01:06.900> about<00:01:07.080> twice<00:01:07.470> as

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
a 64 gig SSD and that's about twice as

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.899 
a 64 gig SSD and that's about twice as
big<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.070> what<00:01:08.189> you<00:01:08.280> get<00:01:08.430> with<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.580> lot<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.760> the

big as what you get with a lot of the

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.640 
big as what you get with a lot of the
other<00:01:09.060> similar<00:01:09.450> systems<00:01:09.869> like<00:01:09.960> this<00:01:10.200> even

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
other similar systems like this even

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.780 
other similar systems like this even
though<00:01:10.860> they<00:01:10.979> keep<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> price<00:01:11.520> down<00:01:11.549> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
though they keep the price down to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.510 
though they keep the price down to
around<00:01:12.240> 299<00:01:12.960> which<00:01:13.470> seems<00:01:13.710> pretty<00:01:13.890> fair<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.369> me

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
around 299 which seems pretty fair to me

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.310 
around 299 which seems pretty fair to me

however<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.600> battery<00:02:04.110> ran<00:02:04.409> for<00:02:04.680> more<00:02:04.920> than
