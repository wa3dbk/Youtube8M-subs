00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:32.330 
the election and then and as our -

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.479 
the election and then and as our -
speech<00:00:32.930> Gerry<00:00:33.260> Adams<00:00:33.440> very<00:00:34.010> clear<00:00:34.250> that<00:00:34.370> his

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
speech Gerry Adams very clear that his

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.310 
speech Gerry Adams very clear that his
preference<00:00:35.030> was<00:00:35.330> that<00:00:35.660> we<00:00:35.780> should<00:00:35.960> fight<00:00:36.170> the

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320

preference was that we should fight the
election<00:00:36.710> and<00:00:37.460> so<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:37.850> think<00:00:38.059> at<00:00:38.300> galvanize

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
election and so I think at galvanize

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.110 
election and so I think at galvanize
people<00:00:39.290> I<00:00:39.590> think<00:00:39.800> it<00:00:40.040> really<00:00:40.579> focused<00:00:40.969> people

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.120 
people I think it really focused people

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.660 
people I think it really focused people
and<00:00:43.090> naturally<00:00:44.260> once<00:00:45.260> it<00:00:45.980> was<00:00:46.190> clear<00:00:46.460> that

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:46.670 
and naturally once it was clear that

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:48.790 
and naturally once it was clear that
that<00:00:47.180> was<00:00:47.719> the<00:00:47.809> direction<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.350> party<00:00:48.649> was

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
that was the direction the party was

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.790 
that was the direction the party was
hevanddan<00:00:49.180> all<00:00:50.180> thoughts<00:00:50.510> turned<00:00:50.899> to<00:00:51.020> who<00:00:51.500> the

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
hevanddan all thoughts turned to who the

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.049 
hevanddan all thoughts turned to who the
candidate<00:00:52.670> should<00:00:52.820> be<00:00:53.020> so<00:00:54.219> I<00:00:55.219> hadn't<00:00:55.850> really

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
candidate should be so I hadn't really

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.660 
candidate should be so I hadn't really
thought<00:00:56.090> about<00:00:56.329> any<00:00:57.260> of<00:00:57.500> that<00:00:57.680> up<00:00:58.160> until<00:00:58.370> they

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
thought about any of that up until they

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.240 
thought about any of that up until they
are<00:00:58.789> -<00:00:59.059> other<00:00:59.449> than<00:00:59.780> to<00:01:00.590> be<00:01:00.710> in<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:00.920> camp<00:01:01.160> that
