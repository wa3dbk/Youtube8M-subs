 fire that is an eastern fps that is 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:20.150
 Becoming very successful here in Brazil.

 take a fast and fun fun game 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:26.010
 more difficult to master this is the 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.630
 cross fire a fps coming from china comes 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.369
 conquering millions of fans around the world 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.410
 all inclusive in brazil 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.239
 despite being basically the same as all 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.489
 the faithful if you have a gun you look 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.309
 You know you shoot the other guy's head . 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.980
 rossi was a bit of a difficult game 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.960
 You pick up the arrow keys and it's 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.050
 exactly what sets the 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.520
 good professional modes that 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.670
 the flaws are varied have the classics 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.250
 times several times have the all against 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.710
 all and has even the very rental locations 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.539
 as a way that kinda imitate fashion and 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.210
 the themes of ballistics towers 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.789
 destroy and modules face monsters 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.769
 giant aliens serious face monsters 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.769
 Giants A Look At The Deal 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:12.259
 the first thing that happens when 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.630
 You enter the safe is what you will see. 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.420
 which has a million base weapons to its 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.950
 but when you start the game 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.329
 you have even just a little bit 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.140
 more that you can take into the 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.729
 arena 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.159
 You need to keep playing the game. 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.380
 for you to earn points called gps 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.630
 that you use to buy other weapons and 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.280
 other equipment knives items 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.899
 basically what you will use to 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.179
 break the face of your opponent 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.149
 guns are a little bit expensive but like 

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:40.789
 You can always spend a 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:42.590
 truth and access the items years 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.360
 after all it's a free game so he 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.700
 I needed the money any way to the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.759
 used in championship mode is the mode 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.009
 seek and destroy five against five 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:55.329
 basically this mode is very common in 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.399
 fps since 90 and little immortalized by 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:00.890
 very famous counterstrike in this way 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:03.409
 times will kill each other madly and have 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.450
 a terrorist team and a team against 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.789
 terrorist one has to plant a bomb 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.769
 and another to disarm this bomb 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.450
 simple the championships that the 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.160
 Asphalt has been growing more and more 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.410
 national championship has come to reward 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.590
 its winners with 20 thousand reais and one 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.069
 wave to compete in the world in china 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:23.660
 disputing a prize of 350 thousand reais 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:25.370
 now we are going to give some tips for 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.980
 What email did you start now with 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.560
 failures to know how you can get the 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:34.519
 play more professionally and stop 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.709
 take all headshot of cameron or arsenal 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.870
 As I said, you'll have one for 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.760
 weapons meeting you choose 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.829
 but in championships are still restricted 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.900
 have a certain list of weapons that you 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:48.079
 You can actually use well Championship 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.980
 so our tip is to master your 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:50.599
 weapons 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.760
 you need to know exactly how the 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:55.160
 when it behaves forms of damage 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.919
 What is her shooting speed? 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.560
 how long does it take to change the comb 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:03.230
 very important how the recall works 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.720
 her recall is that thing when it happens 

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.400
 the shot your aim opens and then I had 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.019
 begins to leave the half time after 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.109
 you unload the fish face 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.310
 tip number 2 has to do with the maps 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.900
 every championship has a pre- 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.160
 determined from maps then it is always good 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.959
 take a look before you 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.050
 subscribed to one of the maps 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.990
 seek to destroy are usually very 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.510
 the great kaka then the cool are you to know 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:27.220
 exactly how routes work for 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.110
 each of the points where they plant the 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.240
 because on this route that your 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.980
 team will have to defend then will have 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.330
 to go and plant the pump 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.160
 Another important thing is you 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:37.090
 nomenclature that staff use for each 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.890
 part of the map 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.570
 the maps of looking to destroy are very 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:42.550
 big guys then the staff to get 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.440
 communicate fast I kind of nicknames 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.370
 for balcony-type map areas 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.840
 Veranda Inverted Captivity Tunnel Then 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.310
 It's nice to know this so you can 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.030
 communicate with the team quickly and set up a 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.430
 strategy number three nerves of steel 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.990
 Seriously, it's no wonder that 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.470
 movie character action type 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.140
 thieves rodobens and stayed there tirá tatá 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.280
 It's another day at the crossfire office. 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.560
 one of the most important things 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.420
 dominate the recall as I said then not 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.580
 nothing you come and my God 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.900
 I never took my ball to start 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.640
 carry a comb on the face because your 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.620
 life will start to open up your kids 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.450
 they start only this sometimes seek then the 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.840
 cool, you 'll know how to draw in gusts 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:24.760
 controlled by ta ta and know exactly 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.590
 where is your team going? 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.910
 another thing that differentiates the names of 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:30.700
 true professionals is that the guys 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:32.980
 know the dosage of when they walk and 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.930
 when they shoot like in real life the 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.700
 Taking a stationary weapon is much easier. 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.770
 than take a walking weapon and when 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.700
 you walk your life it also opens the same way 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:46.419
 recall or be nerves of steel 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.790
 stop shooting and shoot controlled bursts 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.830
 for you do not play with the flaws yet 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:53.470
 So, head over to the link in our

 video description low the game haste 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.740
