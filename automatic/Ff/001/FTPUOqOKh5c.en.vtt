00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:10.770
 hello everyone I'm working with android 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.290
 and in this video I'm going to show you how 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.690
 download paid applications from a 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.119
 external application to the play store 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.100
 we have two applications that elected 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.560
 would be a toy of and black mart are very 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.570
 known or if they are not known now their 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.130
 I'll explain more or less what they are and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.660
 because the ones chosen as best 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.660
 application download applications 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.489
 of payment for android is worth how it 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.170
 they download and it would be looking in the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.050
 browser in our browser that 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.499
 have by default in android 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:47.399
 we could put the apt and of apeca uy 

00:00:43.499 --> 00:00:49.139
 apt and apeca forgiveness applies for 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.510
 that you do not know is an extension of the 

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:53.309
 Android apps and we would come out the 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.549
 first I'm installing app toy from 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.989
 Android app store would go in there and 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:01:00.209
 give it to download simply install 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.760
 now and for the black sea the same 

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:05.670
 we could install it from the app toy 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.920
 but I 'm also going to choose what black 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.150
 marta itchy so we just put 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.790
 that and we give it 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.770
 and here we would go down and where could 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.710
 download we give you to download good a 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.490
 Once we unload the two and the 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.660
 let's start let's start with apt and 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.250
 everything and as you know is the application 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.570
 best known for downloading apps and 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.940
 paid games for free 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.920
 it works with repositories and it's very 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.210
 I've been using it since 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.100
 that I started with android and it has always 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:34.600
 properly worked, you can also 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.850
 update own payment games 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.040
 that you have downloaded to the latest version 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:43.420
 you can download this magnificent where the 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.490
 we have seen and want to stand out or be in 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.490
 against not against no more difference 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:52.210
 well against black mark it would be that 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.310
 this one is more stable but black mart what 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.440
 that it offers is a greater content of 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.540
 applications so good what 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.940
 I recommend I would have both 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.030
 applications do not choose which is the best 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:06.610
 application to download or be these 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.920
 they are the best so my recommendation 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.240
 would have both and so where not the 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.370
 we see in one we can see it in another 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.170
 because on the one hand the black mudflats 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.680
 There is more content but it can be more 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.079
 unstable and then the apt 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.450
 there is less content but there is not 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:23.150
 not much less, that is all that 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.760
 go go and look for the best they are 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.980
 apt let's see for example if he's in 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.189
 minecraft minecraft pocket edition here 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.189
 is it so 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.110
 and as you see here the first one would be if 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.730
 I'm not mistaking minecraft here is it 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.709
 you give to install vale 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.500
 let's see black sea also how is the 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:44.390
 aesthetics and a little bit black 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.129
 marte black market forgiveness is a 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.120
 application that will allow us to download 

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.680
 the android applications of way 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.930
 free also black sea is a 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.220
 application very similar to toy's with the 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.660
 that we can download and 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.170
 Updates for free with 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:59.569
 a simple very intuitive interface here 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.030
 there is a new version available 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:04.069
 you can install and on my recommendation 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.709
 As I said before, it would be to have both 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.720
 and so when we want to download a 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.530
 payment application if you are not in a 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.640
 is in another insurance and if not 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.709
 we could put the application that 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.319
 we want here or in our browser 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.970
 we would put the name here before the 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.480
 application for example minecraft or that 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.160
 of address as such and apk and there you 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.540
 will come several pages that could be 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.920
 download also easily but 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.319
 you have it more at hand and it's a 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.299
 application therefore much more comfortable as well 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.370
 that without further delay this has been all 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.599
