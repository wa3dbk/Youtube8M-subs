00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.550
 we are here more in barcelona in a pretty nice location 8 us ioc a 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.709
 beautiful images start typical image 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:13.599
 I think they will return a presentation that though which it does 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:16.470
 gave us the manufacturer where we are now with its latest smart 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.310
 presented the gooyer as a transmitting team 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.539
 And that's the very smartest ever saying that people say they are 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.210
 that is what they understand by agreements made 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:29.050
 true 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.119
 Alkmaar 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.630
 were in the iphone again 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.720
 but the steel 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.030
 you want to lose more opponent 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.020
 pretty poor english but what could make out is that this one 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.080
 telephone in a couple in their fifties has a quad core processor 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.290
 well a piece of paper that is pretty fast or indeed the fastest phone 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.290
 someday that is yet to be seen 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.550
 15 4 comma 7 in screen and that is where goes a good hour ie also according to true 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.320
 I am my form and you would almost say the strongest suits ever being are in 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.870
 for this type of device, the pivot turns on and becomes four points 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.160
 one point 2 with on top of that your skin of your knees complete and 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.840
 martin adapt and environmental management 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.070
 but be careful 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.780
 we are all options and lots of options 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.310
 to make us crazy if you want what I noticed is that you turn as one 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.630
 book from the coast it is not so much scrolling man more firing to there it 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.260
 next hauser screen 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.090
 with a 13 megapixel camera that of a trick he recognizes the people who 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.110
 on the photo ap shot making a photo of the room to further this case 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.660
 work and tieger and then you can also send automatic photo to a fun 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.500
 trick 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.600
 or not going to use week 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.709
 the sprint the fastest time grows the pieces of wood and the taliban 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.610

 so work in the movie the phone is 8 komme 4 millimeter thick mario is teams 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.880
 if and that you see this kind of stage you can drive with gloves on 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.880
 it's cold antwerp room you can just leave one screen 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.440
 what does this best phone ever cost but audibly has the right to 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.300
 reports 399 euros only he should come q2 come out vague marketing term always pass 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.419
