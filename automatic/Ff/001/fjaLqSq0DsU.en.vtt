00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 the sentences will end up on a 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.480
 other video on fifa 15 fifa ultimate 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.820
 team 15 for a whole new team 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.120
 for a series all be then 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.309
 today we will do an hour 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.960
 play with a team as you can 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.160
 see him a team from the Netherlands a 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.520
 Dutch team 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.350
 so suddenly older choice between full 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.930
 of equipped suddenly I was 60 but the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.490
 credit I chose I opted for a 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.410
 heavy is not sure a lot of 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.029
 people we are obvious about the 2 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.170
 days 2 not even wanted to lose a fall 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.420
 from today at the beginning of this year 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.890
 beginning of this guy at 15 of the coup I decide 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.630
 to make a hedge frankly I have not 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.309
 made matches yet but on the 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.260
 paper but not really to the air 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.820
 to be really good so if there are any 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.829
 players that I forgot the shots I 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.899
 not say yes before I know that I am 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.930
 household but I'm m it's an attacker 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.280
 it's a healthy environment the water dce and I 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.829
 will put a lot I should put 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.469
 a sheet of metal hours I do not have it I do not buy it 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.539
 again tested this team cost me to 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.550
 nearly 40,000 credit remained 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.289
 especially on the player the governor who 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.320
 cost me 40 which cost me an eye on 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.960
 20 credits him because there is no 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.020
 many left wingers in holland 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.939
 as for the low countries and suddenly it is he 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.049
 pretty good there is a very good map and 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.159
 so he will listen to us anyway 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.210
 twenty thousand credit all the helicopters 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.460

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.120
 that they admit it for skylight 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.240
 opposite his resentment what damage 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.930

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:07.150

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:11.400
 you do not have the right honestly he 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:15.960
 will call branch it all to straws 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:21.580
 Straw straws 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:23.050

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:24.580
 countries to present in the 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.200
 cages where we see there has flaws 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.510
 he did his little festival before 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:36.460
 show before scoring this goal 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:38.020
 frankly is stopped at the same time 

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:40.230
 rage quit but he does not even leave 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:44.350
 looked at the goal but it's disgusting 

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:46.900
 well go jean ba voila that's for sure on a 

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:49.120
 draw that held second rage quit on 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:51.460
 another video that I had seen from 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:54.880
 his return him only one if you want 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.470
 to have enough even not less to wadi ski 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:58.450
 the man of the match 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:01.540
 there is no man of the match she 

00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:04.750
 normally beats it's yes swimmers it's 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:07.750
 will hold up who is seen he had 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:10.960
 also if the word we do not care after all 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.790
 good people if you have this team 

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:14.680
 Dutch you can put a little 

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:17.200
 like it can be very fun and it 

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.950
 Lack tell if you have this 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.950
 series you can 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.090
 and if you already have a proposal or 

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.950
 players who are not their position I 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:29.230
 could change who are beneficial 

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:33.010
 for the player teams open to all 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:35.320
 you can send a little by little on 

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:37.450
 this guy on am I say yes I am 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.280
 focused on on other things but 

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:40.750
 we are a little comment on the video 

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.300
 it makes me very happy too 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.950
 so people are finally playing this video 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.700
 we were aiming for other videos 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:47.700
 that's all
