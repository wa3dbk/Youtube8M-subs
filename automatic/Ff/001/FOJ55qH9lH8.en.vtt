00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.009
 I'm here and play a little 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.900
 let's move on to the first medal or 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.310
 here I have a funvic team and here what 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.460
 you see to the right I do not know if you see the mouse 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:40.960
 but a lot of the case is on the right 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:45.699
 here I have my group virgin germÃ¡n der me 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:50.949
 I took starman from the cold toilet ban ki-moon 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:52.690
 and then it is worth to see that you 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:55.300
 I leave the page down there puts you how 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:59.649
 do I'm not going to say anything because this 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:01.559
 is with the pokemon room here there was a 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.809
 object sounds to me of any object 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.520
 of the red fire pokemon you have to get off 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.460
 the room that according to piracy I do not 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.840
 I can upload it, I'm not going to put it in 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.840
 description but 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.640
 do not search in google very easy and without 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.000
 be that the mouse in the middle looks bad 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.109
 we go 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.539
 good as you see the mouse the mouse 

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:25.850
 is that I do not even know what I'm saying 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.340
 rumor you can download it let's get 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.259
 in the cave stuck in here but I say 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.520
 better let's leave it for the video going 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.959
 a little bit like that because the 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.200
 servers only one server and then 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.289
 it's tight 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.920
 is a multiplayer pokemon we see a 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:43.159
 lot of people playing online 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.600
 in which we are going to change mons direct 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.170
 I'm going up there joaquin group 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.180
 little bit because it 's crap shit and not 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.640
 I have another we can better, I do not have it 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.820
 What is the problem? Well, well, 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.430
 we are a multiplayer game of 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:02.270
 massive pokemon and but there is only one 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.039
 server then you imagine if there 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.590
 a lot of people and everything is on a server or 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.269
 it is logically being is sometimes not 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.920
 there is a gap now it gets more or less like that 

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.920
 there then 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:20.330
 you can download it is very simple so 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.250
 you are not going to have more problems and I do not know 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.800
 how it is added so if you know any 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.030
 it's cold adri I'm not going to play much either 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.340
 be 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.310
 play a little bit from time to time 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.990
 Absolutely fun and good 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.030
 I was here imagine why you told me 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.980
 try it and make a video like that 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.270
 teach it and so that people can 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.820
 play on your pc 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.350
 in pokemon online it does not seem like a 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.470
 great idea and that's why more than anything 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:49.040
 I'm going up so that's why we're going 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.040
 to see yes 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.450
 let's see if we kill the four 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:57.060
 more peaks for you to see it is pretty 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.280
 simple moves with the arrows you see 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.989
 the arrows good you are not seeing me 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.880
 give them but I say they are the arrows 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:07.590
 and if you want me well and if not then nothing and 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.970
 the z and the x as ay bz xv the miralo 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.500
 in your mice are together so 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:12.500
 you will not have much problem 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.150
 madrid then you remember the video of 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.909

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.829
 and tentacle in the water so everything 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:38.970
 the world knows that they are hateful beings 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:38.970

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.930
 come do not move towards you have to 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:21.860
 talk to them but if they want to fight 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.650
 I mean it's great because after 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.660
 jump or I do not normally want other 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.670
 high I am of the people that of the 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.889
 people who fought against all 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.830
 bugs of the world 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:35.060
 against bulls / I will have said all because 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.129
 it generates me if they came up more than experience 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.199
 with the coaches the savages do not 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.710
 they go up nothing experience less if they are to 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:45.670
 bat or tentacles 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:46.660
 then that 's what I mean that I 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:49.300

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.310

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:01.840
