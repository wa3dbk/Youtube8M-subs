00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.110
 hi suppose you are in an algebra lesson 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.430
 you are just starting to learn 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.230
 trigonometry 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.540
 and you so boring and boring and in this 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.700
 believe there is no your guilt or teacher's guilt 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.920
 just pi is wrong i don't 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.900
 I state that the value of pi is 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.660
 wrong you really equal 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.590
 the ratio of the circumference of a diameter to b 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.430
 the value of pi is 3, day 41 well 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.439
 a bunch of numbers 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.689
 i'm just saying that the number itself is somehow 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.519
 wrong choice and not the most 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.590
 the right number to hold 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.420
 mathematical operations with a circle in 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.800
 discussions about pi and 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.210
 about the fact that Columbus discovered America 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.739
 have something in common 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.290
 did Columbus really discover America? 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.860
 as it turns out Columbus did not open 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.170
 America 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.750
 the same goes for the number pi school you 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.620
 learn that pi is the most important constant 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.510
 circumference 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.730
 many formulas that you learn on 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.100
 memory contains the number pi constant pi 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.230
 there is a very long time but if 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.480
 formulas that contain pi seem to you 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.120
 incomprehensible and complex it is not yours 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.129
 wine is the fault of pi now i 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.769
 I tell you what I mean here I have 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.659
 pie we regard it as a circle 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.060
 how do you think how much you should be in 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.270
 this pie you probably say one pi 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.909
 and here and there is 360 degrees of cake 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.710
 not at all pi this 2pi suppose I am you 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.900
 asking what part of the cake to you 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.240
 cut off you say pi split by 8 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.729
 I assume that this is the eighth part 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.860
 and this turns out to be 16 part most 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.000
 will say so what is it that you just take 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.130
 and you divide by 2 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.229
 Why is mathematics so complicated? 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.619
 be simple and clear for example one 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.930
 pie 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.060
 one PI and you ask is it possible 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.229
 we are constantly formulas instead of pi 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.880
 use 2 pi 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.340
 maybe there is some other constant 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.159
 there is this number tau tau 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.140
 this is a whole pie they are half of it 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.750
 the pie is the half of the pie 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.119
 is it half tau or something divided by 2 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.549
 and if we need one 16 then this pie 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.100
 then it will be then divided by 16 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.020
 agree it is easier but always when 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.270
 will need to work with radians 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.909
 will have to translate uv when and vice versa 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.829
 this is completely inconvenient tell you and let's 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.899
 let's see what happens if instead of pi 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.090
 use u in math lessons 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.099
 you draw all these graphic formulas and 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.750
 of course the value of sine is possible every 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.620
 times it is easier to remember or 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.690
 generally calculate 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.610
 on the calculator just sleep harder all 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.799
 understand this let's remember what is 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.140
 general sine of a corner sine of a corner is equal 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.700
 the y value of the point where 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.920
 side of the corner intersects the circle 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:28.799
 let's draw a coordinate plane 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.230
 table do not sleep begin with a point at which 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.870
 angle is zero sine 0 will be zero 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.000
 then comes the value then divided by 4 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.640
 this means a quarter circle and 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.920
 the y coordinate at this point is one 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.079
 nothing complicated but if the angle is 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.989
 equal to tau divided by 2 it will be 

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:48.540
 half circle and y coordinates here 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:51.680
 again equal to zero angle equal to 3 then y 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.540
 divided by 4 sine is equal to minus one 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.459
 angle is equal to tau we come back to this 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.500
 the starting point and the sine of the angle 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:01.769
 tau is zero here and the function graph 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.930
 Sine is easy and simple and all because the 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:06.510
 this is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the radius 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.879
 they are to diameter and how do we define 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:11.040
 circle circle is a geometric 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.049
 place of points equidistant from some 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.420
 points called the center of the circle on 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.519
 given distance called radius 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.799
 the circumference from here and the ratio of the length 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.660
 circle to radius then y and what 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:23.639
 about formulas that use pi 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.069
 they somehow change may become 

00:03:23.639 --> 00:03:28.530
 harder for example the euler identity 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.349
 e to the degree and multiply by 1 minus 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.299
 units write it became e in the degree then 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:34.889
 have divided by 2 multiplied by as well 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.569
 minus one 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:39.060
 this is a completely unknown identity 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:41.400
 by the way this identity follows from the formula 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.799
 euler which we can write also in 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.489
 degree a multiplied by tt equals cosine 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.889
 theta plus 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.049
 and multiply by sine theta let's instead 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:51.150
 you then substitute something like this 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.489
 the formula will look easy to remember 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.040
 that the sine of the tau angle is the value of y 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.410
 the coordinate of this point is it is zero a 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.530
 and multiply by 0 equals zero and cosine 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.510
 tau angle is the x value of this 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:06.090
 point and it is equal to one 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.519
 what comes out 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.569
 degree a multiplied by t equals one 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.480
 how do you like this 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:14.480
 and how do you think which constant is better
