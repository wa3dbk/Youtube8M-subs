egg and a broken eggshell so if I put

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.670 
egg and a broken eggshell so if I put
this<00:05:19.460> in<00:05:19.730> here<00:05:20.090> then<00:05:20.690> they<00:05:20.960> can<00:05:21.200> see<00:05:21.410> that

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
this in here then they can see that

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:24.250 
this in here then they can see that
spawned<00:05:22.130> it<00:05:22.310> and<00:05:22.550> it's<00:05:23.330> a<00:05:23.540> one<00:05:23.690> time<00:05:23.720> it's<00:05:24.050> also

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
spawned it and it's a one time it's also

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:25.960 
spawned it and it's a one time it's also
of<00:05:24.470> this<00:05:24.650> is<00:05:24.890> your<00:05:25.040> friend<00:05:25.400> so<00:05:25.550> this<00:05:25.700> should

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
of this is your friend so this should

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.400 
of this is your friend so this should
follow<00:05:26.240> you<00:05:26.450> around<00:05:26.890> hopefully<00:05:27.890> mom<00:05:29.380> yeah<00:05:30.380> I

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:30.410 
follow you around hopefully mom yeah I

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.230 
follow you around hopefully mom yeah I
think<00:05:30.590> it's<00:05:30.770> stuck<00:05:31.100> will<00:05:31.640> just<00:05:31.790> pop<00:05:31.820> out<00:05:32.060> it

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 
think it's stuck will just pop out it

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.180 
think it's stuck will just pop out it
damn<00:05:32.480> it<00:05:32.600> come<00:05:33.440> on<00:05:33.910> yeah<00:05:35.260> ok<00:05:36.260> so<00:05:36.710> here<00:05:36.980> we<00:05:37.160> have

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
damn it come on yeah ok so here we have

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.110 
damn it come on yeah ok so here we have
the<00:05:37.730> mimic<00:05:38.120> mimic<00:05:38.870> chess<00:05:39.200> so<00:05:39.560> I<00:05:39.830> see<00:05:40.670> so<00:05:41.000> it's

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:41.120 
the mimic mimic chess so I see so it's

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.150 
the mimic mimic chess so I see so it's
random<00:05:41.510> which<00:05:41.690> spawns<00:05:42.020> and<00:05:42.350> is<00:05:42.620> it<00:05:42.830> real

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
random which spawns and is it real

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.820 
random which spawns and is it real
because<00:05:43.460> it<00:05:43.940> can<00:05:44.210> be<00:05:44.510> either<00:05:44.900> hostile<00:05:45.590> or<00:05:45.800> a

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
because it can be either hostile or a

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:48.880 
because it can be either hostile or a
real<00:05:46.190> chance<00:05:46.550> so<00:05:47.450> you<00:05:47.900> know<00:05:48.020> it's<00:05:48.620> like<00:05:48.830> a

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
real chance so you know it's like a

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.980 
real chance so you know it's like a
decision<00:05:49.520> whatever<00:05:49.970> so<00:05:50.330> it<00:05:50.420> drops<00:05:50.570> nothing

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
decision whatever so it drops nothing

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.170 
decision whatever so it drops nothing
but<00:05:51.260> if<00:05:51.500> it's<00:05:51.770> a<00:05:51.950> real<00:05:52.130> Chester<00:05:52.460> will<00:05:52.880> actually

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
but if it's a real Chester will actually

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:56.020 
but if it's a real Chester will actually
have<00:05:53.300> loot<00:05:53.600> inside<00:05:53.780> also<00:05:54.470> it<00:05:55.070> spawns<00:05:55.430> in<00:05:55.640> kids

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
have loot inside also it spawns in kids

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.120 
have loot inside also it spawns in kids
randomly<00:05:56.870> in<00:05:57.110> kids<00:05:57.470> it<00:05:57.740> don't<00:05:57.830> have<00:05:57.979> to<00:05:58.040> be

00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:58.130 
randomly in kids it don't have to be

00:05:58.130 --> 00:05:58.660 
randomly in kids it don't have to be
about

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:58.670 
about

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.570 
about
mineshafter<00:05:59.210> anything<00:05:59.860> yeah<00:06:00.860> so<00:06:01.280> I<00:06:01.310> drop

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
mineshafter anything yeah so I drop

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.230 
mineshafter anything yeah so I drop
something<00:06:02.230> but<00:06:03.230> if<00:06:03.320> it's<00:06:03.470> rio<00:06:03.650> you<00:06:03.800> get<00:06:03.980> looped

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
something but if it's rio you get looped

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.940 
something but if it's rio you get looped
look<00:06:05.240> this<00:06:05.420> I<00:06:05.690> guess<00:06:06.350> it's<00:06:06.560> kind<00:06:06.800> of<00:06:06.890> cute

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:06.950 
look this I guess it's kind of cute

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.000 
look this I guess it's kind of cute
spanked<00:06:07.960> but<00:06:08.960> we'll<00:06:09.020> go<00:06:09.320> and<00:06:09.500> see<00:06:09.560> if<00:06:09.770> it<00:06:09.890> is

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:10.010 
spanked but we'll go and see if it is

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.890 
spanked but we'll go and see if it is
one<00:06:10.310> of<00:06:10.340> the<00:06:10.520> mimic<00:06:10.790> ones<00:06:11.030> or<00:06:11.330> if<00:06:11.420> it's<00:06:11.630> real

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:11.900 
one of the mimic ones or if it's real

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.540 
one of the mimic ones or if it's real
one<00:06:12.020> so<00:06:12.200> if<00:06:12.320> you<00:06:12.440> right-click<00:06:12.680> you<00:06:13.100> should<00:06:13.370> see

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:13.550 
one so if you right-click you should see

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:16.180 
one so if you right-click you should see
like<00:06:13.730> a<00:06:13.760> little<00:06:14.680> animation<00:06:15.680> but<00:06:15.860> yeah<00:06:16.010> this

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.190 
like a little animation but yeah this

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:18.130 
like a little animation but yeah this
one's<00:06:16.460> the<00:06:16.700> mimic<00:06:17.090> one<00:06:17.270> so<00:06:17.450> they<00:06:17.570> are<00:06:17.690> hostile

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:18.140 
one's the mimic one so they are hostile

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.040 
one's the mimic one so they are hostile
they<00:06:18.440> do<00:06:18.590> a<00:06:18.620> bit<00:06:18.920> of<00:06:18.950> damage<00:06:19.100> and<00:06:19.630> gel<00:06:20.630> could<00:06:20.930> it

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:21.050 
they do a bit of damage and gel could it

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:23.620 
they do a bit of damage and gel could it
it's<00:06:21.650> pretty<00:06:21.830> funny<00:06:22.100> but<00:06:22.400> that's<00:06:22.910> that's<00:06:23.420> the

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:23.630 
it's pretty funny but that's that's the

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.080 
it's pretty funny but that's that's the
