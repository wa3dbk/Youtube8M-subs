have<00:01:16.630> arrived<00:01:16.930> removing<00:01:17.830> the<00:01:17.950> parts<00:01:18.250> that<00:01:18.340> we

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
have arrived removing the parts that we

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.940 
have arrived removing the parts that we
don't<00:01:18.729> need<00:01:18.909> them<00:01:19.899> after<00:01:20.440> that<00:01:20.590> we're<00:01:20.830> gonna

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
don't need them after that we're gonna

move to the fabrication facility where
we're<00:01:25.090> going<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.539> actually<00:01:25.750> reshape<00:01:26.350> the

we're going to actually reshape the

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.450 
we're going to actually reshape the

00:01:32.309 --> 00:01:32.319 
the chassis that you can't see right now

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:34.499 
the chassis that you can't see right now
but<00:01:32.380> we're<00:01:32.649> gonna<00:01:32.710> fit<00:01:33.069> these<00:01:33.250> quarter<00:01:34.119> panels

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
but we're gonna fit these quarter panels

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:36.450 
but we're gonna fit these quarter panels
to<00:01:34.659> fit<00:01:34.869> exactly<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.649> Flair<00:01:35.890> expansions

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:36.460 
to fit exactly to the Flair expansions

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.580 
to fit exactly to the Flair expansions
at<00:01:37.390> that<00:01:37.539> point<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:37.899> would<00:01:37.990> come<00:01:38.110> back<00:01:38.140> to<00:01:38.380> the

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
at that point it would come back to the

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.919 
at that point it would come back to the
workshop<00:01:39.090> we'll<00:01:40.090> spend<00:01:40.330> another<00:01:40.600> two<00:01:40.899> or

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
we're trying to achieve with this car is

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.649 
we're trying to achieve with this car is
nothing<00:01:59.740> short<00:02:00.159> than<00:02:00.310> a<00:02:00.459> factory<00:02:01.119> finish<00:02:01.360> when

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
nothing short than a factory finish when

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.559 
nothing short than a factory finish when
we're<00:02:01.810> done<00:02:01.989> so<00:02:02.800> it's<00:02:03.009> not<00:02:03.160> only<00:02:03.459> the<00:02:04.209> color

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
we're done so it's not only the color

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:06.660 
we're done so it's not only the color
match<00:02:04.869> we're<00:02:05.229> looking<00:02:05.560> to<00:02:05.679> achieve<00:02:05.830> but<00:02:06.489> it's

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:06.670 
match we're looking to achieve but it's

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.600 
match we're looking to achieve but it's
the<00:02:06.849> texture<00:02:07.509> and<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.950> complexity<00:02:09.580> of

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
the texture and the complexity of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
peeking over these carbon fiber products

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.110 
peeking over these carbon fiber products
it's<00:02:14.410> it's<00:02:14.650> difficult<00:02:15.160> they're<00:02:15.879> they're

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
it's it's difficult they're they're

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.199
