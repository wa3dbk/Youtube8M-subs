you know up and down the table a few
pens<00:03:42.299> and<00:03:43.299> probably<00:03:43.629> kids<00:03:46.079> it'll<00:03:47.079> keep<00:03:47.260> on

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:47.469 
pens and probably kids it'll keep on

00:03:47.469 --> 00:03:49.270 
pens and probably kids it'll keep on
cutting

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
cutting

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.920 
cutting
kind<00:03:49.490> of<00:03:49.520> a<00:03:49.610> soft<00:03:49.880> wheel<00:03:50.150> that<00:03:50.420> is<00:03:50.540> running<00:03:50.810> on

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:50.930 
kind of a soft wheel that is running on

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.780 
kind of a soft wheel that is running on
so<00:03:51.530> it'll<00:03:51.620> keep<00:03:51.830> on<00:03:51.950> cutting<00:03:52.190> for<00:03:52.520> a<00:03:52.550> little

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
so it'll keep on cutting for a little

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:59.949 
so it'll keep on cutting for a little
while<00:03:53.950> without<00:03:54.950> even<00:03:55.190> adjusting<00:03:55.670> the

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.400 

the<00:04:16.820> nice<00:04:16.970> thing<00:04:17.000> about<00:04:17.269> using<00:04:17.810> the<00:04:17.959> belt

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410

attachment is you don't have to worry as
much<00:04:20.570> about<00:04:20.870> the<00:04:21.500> wheel<00:04:21.739> like<00:04:22.250> and<00:04:22.550> the

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:22.970 
much about the wheel like and the

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:25.960 
much about the wheel like and the
bearings<00:04:23.390> warming<00:04:23.810> up<00:04:23.960> and<00:04:24.670> dressing<00:04:25.670> the

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
bearings warming up and dressing the

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:27.790 
bearings warming up and dressing the
wheel<00:04:26.120> all<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.390> time<00:04:26.750> like<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.290> know<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.560> can

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
wheel all the time like you know I can

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.200 
wheel all the time like you know I can
just<00:04:27.830> shut<00:04:28.160> this<00:04:28.310> thing<00:04:28.370> off<00:04:28.730> and<00:04:28.760> turn<00:04:29.180> it

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
just shut this thing off and turn it

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.680 
just shut this thing off and turn it
back<00:04:29.330> on<00:04:29.600> within<00:04:29.930> 5<00:04:30.350> seconds<00:04:30.800> and<00:04:31.690> nothing

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
back on within 5 seconds and nothing

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:33.420 
back on within 5 seconds and nothing
matters

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
matters

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:39.430 
matters
whereas<00:04:34.430> wheels<00:04:34.850> are<00:04:35.150> a<00:04:35.180> lot<00:04:35.510> more<00:04:35.990> picky<00:04:38.440> say

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
whereas wheels are a lot more picky say

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.900 
whereas wheels are a lot more picky say
yeah<00:04:39.530> this<00:04:39.650> still<00:04:39.860> has<00:04:40.040> a<00:04:40.310> few<00:04:40.640> pits<00:04:41.390> in<00:04:41.600> it<00:04:41.750> but

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:42.910 
yeah this still has a few pits in it but

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:50.460 
yeah this still has a few pits in it but
that<00:04:43.910> was<00:04:44.030> just<00:04:44.240> what<00:04:44.390> two<00:04:44.600> passes<00:04:48.100> yeah<00:04:49.100> I

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
that was just what two passes yeah I

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:54.760 
that was just what two passes yeah I
think<00:04:51.470> they<00:04:51.590> look<00:04:51.770> good<00:04:51.920> to<00:04:52.070> flip<00:04:53.650> so<00:04:54.650> you're

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
think they look good to flip so you're

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:57.430 
think they look good to flip so you're
not<00:04:54.890> going<00:04:55.070> for<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.310> final<00:04:55.910> surface<00:04:56.510> fit<00:04:56.870> no<00:04:57.050> not

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
not going for a final surface fit no not

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.490 
not going for a final surface fit no not
at<00:04:57.620> all<00:04:57.650> no<00:04:58.490> I'll<00:04:58.670> do<00:04:58.850> it<00:04:58.880> again<00:04:59.500> afterwards

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
at all no I'll do it again afterwards

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.230 
at all no I'll do it again afterwards
like<00:05:00.710> after<00:05:01.040> they're<00:05:01.400> all<00:05:01.520> milled<00:05:01.790> and<00:05:02.090> I<00:05:02.180> know

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
like after they're all milled and I know

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.990 
like after they're all milled and I know
how<00:05:03.050> the<00:05:03.110> blades<00:05:03.410> gonna<00:05:03.650> end<00:05:03.830> up<00:05:04.010> because<00:05:04.880> I

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
how the blades gonna end up because I

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.710 
how the blades gonna end up because I
have<00:05:05.180> other<00:05:05.720> glitch<00:05:06.050> or<00:05:06.200> other<00:05:06.440> belts<00:05:07.720> like

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
have other glitch or other belts like

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:13.750 
have other glitch or other belts like
some<00:05:09.050> of<00:05:09.140> these<00:05:10.240> micron<00:05:11.240> belts<00:05:12.610> for<00:05:13.610> the

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
some of these micron belts for the

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.640 
some of these micron belts for the
grinder<00:05:14.410> watch<00:05:15.410> them<00:05:17.290> but<00:05:18.290> yeah<00:05:18.350> they<00:05:18.500> work

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
grinder watch them but yeah they work

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.970 
grinder watch them but yeah they work
really<00:05:18.860> well<00:05:19.040> to<00:05:19.340> bring<00:05:19.850> it<00:05:20.000> up<00:05:20.120> to<00:05:20.150> a<00:05:20.419> closer

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:20.980 
really well to bring it up to a closer

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.320 
really well to bring it up to a closer
surface<00:05:21.980> finish<00:05:22.250> like<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.490> nicer<00:05:22.850> finish<00:05:22.880> to

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
surface finish like a nicer finish to

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.870 
surface finish like a nicer finish to
end<00:05:23.480> with<00:05:23.660> you<00:05:24.410> do<00:05:24.530> that<00:05:24.680> softer<00:05:25.040> hard<00:05:25.220> hard

all the same size uh Eric's getting
pretty<00:05:45.820> good<00:05:45.880> about<00:05:46.030> keeping<00:05:46.150> a<00:05:46.570> very

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:46.780 
pretty good about keeping a very

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.390 
pretty good about keeping a very
consistent<00:05:47.139> thickness<00:05:47.530> between<00:05:48.009> the<00:05:48.280> whole

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:48.400 
consistent thickness between the whole

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:54.450 
consistent thickness between the whole
batch<00:05:49.620> so<00:05:50.620> there<00:05:51.400> you<00:05:51.460> go<00:05:53.070> that's<00:05:54.070> about<00:05:54.310> all

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
batch so there you go that's about all

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.210 
batch so there you go that's about all
there<00:05:54.580> is<00:05:54.639> to<00:05:54.729> that<00:05:54.970> after<00:05:55.720> after<00:05:56.590> surface

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:57.220 
there is to that after after surface

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.310 
there is to that after after surface
grinding<00:05:57.669> they<00:05:57.880> go<00:05:58.030> over<00:05:58.419> to<00:05:58.600> the<00:05:58.720> PC<00:05:58.960> and<00:05:59.229> see

00:05:59.310 --> 00:05:59.320 
grinding they go over to the PC and see

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:04.770 
grinding they go over to the PC and see
1100<00:06:00.990> oops<00:06:01.990> not<00:06:02.680> there<00:06:03.300> should<00:06:04.300> I<00:06:04.360> put<00:06:04.570> it<00:06:04.660> I

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
1100 oops not there should I put it I

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.490 
1100 oops not there should I put it I
put<00:06:04.810> it<00:06:05.020> here<00:06:06.330> yeah<00:06:07.330> so<00:06:07.630> just<00:06:07.840> got<00:06:07.960> six<00:06:08.169> mounted

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
put it here yeah so just got six mounted

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.920 
put it here yeah so just got six mounted
up<00:06:08.560> right<00:06:08.710> now<00:06:08.830> I'll<00:06:09.099> run<00:06:09.280> that<00:06:09.630> we<00:06:10.630> just<00:06:10.780> had<00:06:10.900> a

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:10.930 
up right now I'll run that we just had a

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.499 
up right now I'll run that we just had a
huge<00:06:11.490> rainstorm<00:06:12.490> and<00:06:13.030> I<00:06:13.090> thought<00:06:13.210> there<00:06:13.389> might

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:13.509 
huge rainstorm and I thought there might

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:15.360 
huge rainstorm and I thought there might
be<00:06:13.539> lightning<00:06:14.050> and<00:06:14.199> power<00:06:14.410> outages<00:06:14.889> so<00:06:14.949> I<00:06:15.130> set

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
be lightning and power outages so I set

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.839 
be lightning and power outages so I set
it<00:06:15.400> all<00:06:15.580> down<00:06:16.500> but<00:06:17.500> yeah<00:06:18.130> so<00:06:18.370> that's<00:06:18.490> the<00:06:18.729> next

00:06:18.839 --> 00:06:18.849 
it all down but yeah so that's the next

00:06:18.849 --> 00:06:21.980 
it all down but yeah so that's the next
step<00:06:19.090> and<00:06:19.300> then<00:06:19.449> from<00:06:19.720> there<00:06:19.900> they<00:06:20.110> turn<00:06:20.349> into

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
step and then from there they turn into

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.990
