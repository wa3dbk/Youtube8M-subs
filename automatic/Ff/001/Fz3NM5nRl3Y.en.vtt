00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.660
 medicine in ancient egypt was surprisingly developed and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.689
 specialized our knowledge about ancient egyptian medicine is 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.390
 we owe it to the papyri that have come to us like papyrus 3 or papyrus 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.669
 kaun 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.079
 his knowledge and medical techniques continue to surprise today and 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:34.340
 for centuries have caused a strong influence on the development of some 

00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:35.920
 sciences 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.020
 when he defeated he visited Egypt he was surprised at the advanced degree of 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.800
 specialization to which the Egyptian doctors had come 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.130
 he got to write 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.390
 some treat only the diseases of the eye other two of the head the clients 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.840
 the abdomen by the internal organs 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.970
 perhaps one of the cultural factors that helped to further develop the 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.500
 medicine was the concern for death and his desire to hold on to life 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.199
 the ancient Egyptians did not believe that the disease was 

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.240
 something inevitable 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:04.220
 although they saw it as a possible cause of a curse or something related to 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.630
 the religious world or the magic 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.030
 from the beginning, medicine was closely linked with priests and their 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.950
 beliefs the magical world and medicine were intrinsically linked 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.170
 relating cause and effect with possession mahle dicción and illness like 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.090
 result of the maritime action 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.850
 identify the cause outside human spirit hobby was imperative for 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.149
 receive the potions 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:29.149
 Enchanted drugs and perhaps amulets needed to eliminate the symptoms 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:33.689
 although not all the symptoms were due to this type of causes a simple 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.890
 traumatism or catarrh was treated fairly empirically 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.340
 and béticos cataplasmas but if the person suffered several in a short time 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.850
 I could then consider that I had some kind of adverse influence 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.190
 the importance of Egyptian medicine translates into the figure of 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.170
 infotep 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.509
 considered as the founder of Egyptian medicine and was elevated to the 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:55.700
 divinity category at times has indicated 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.909
 enduring even in the Greek culture copious estate 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.840
 for healing for the Romans 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.230
 the mythical religious conception of the disease in infotep Egypt 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.700
 it led a magico-religious and empirical approach 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.629
 a combination of practical surgical rituals and an extensive vademecum 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:12.599
 pharmacological 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.099
 There are also some attempts at rationalization, such as those 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.060
 appreciate in the papyrus is mick that describes 48 clinical cases and mention 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.680
 causes or magical treatments and bringing a rational approach to the 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.119
 treatment of certain diseases and injuries 

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.589
 one of his discoveries was the use of opiate derivatives as 

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:30.779
 anesthesia method 

00:02:30.779 --> 00:02:34.090
 also the treatment of wounds and their healing by empirical methods and 

00:02:34.089 --> 00:02:35.289
 diagnostic 

00:02:35.289 --> 00:02:36.450
 in papyrus smith 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.430
 by removing some examples we find cases about their pure cranial meninges 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.609
 cerebrospinal fluid 

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:44.109
 and intracranial pulsations 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.569
 there are better that there are dedicated several chapels to his cult as in the temples 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.569
 of karnak brought out the temple of isis on the island of rows 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:55.899
 Another cause of the development of medicine is found in the hostile habitat of 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:56.939
 Ancient Egypt 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:00.629
 with dangerous animals or that transmit diseases a hard climate and a 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.099
 very hard-working population 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.489
 Given this conjuncture of factors, it became necessary to develop techniques for 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.699
 prevention and healing 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:10.409
 examples of this development so early we can deduce them from the papyrus edwin es 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.689
 my who belongs to the first dynasties 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.900
 both in this game and in the river the functions of the heart are described 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.449
 and the importance of this in the functioning of the rest of the organism 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:23.010
 the doctors when examining a patient measured his heart by taking him 

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:26.599
 the pulse and even though they did not have a system of lying beats and they knew how to say 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.699
 problems depending on whether the beats were too fast or slow 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:35.389
 there is no comparable medical achievement in all seniority until arrival 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:36.299
 of Greek culture
