wrist is a top spot today for a woman's
body<00:01:49.229> it's<00:01:49.920> not<00:01:49.979> like<00:01:50.220> ladies<00:01:50.579> come<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.880> and

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
body it's not like ladies come in and

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.940 
body it's not like ladies come in and
say<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.420> know<00:01:51.509> can<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.780> put<00:01:51.930> a<00:01:51.960> portrait<00:01:52.770> on

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
say you know can you put a portrait on

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.149 
say you know can you put a portrait on
my<00:01:52.979> stomach<00:01:53.570> a<00:01:54.570> lot<00:01:55.439> of<00:01:55.560> times<00:01:55.740> they're

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
my stomach a lot of times they're

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.219 
my stomach a lot of times they're
getting<00:01:56.369> something<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.479> their<00:01:57.659> side<00:01:57.899> it

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
getting something like on their side it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.020 
getting something like on their side it
might<00:01:58.350> be<00:01:58.439> organic<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.250> if<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.460> does<00:01:59.610> stretch

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
might be organic so if it does stretch

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.060 
might be organic so if it does stretch
it<00:02:00.479> doesn't<00:02:01.170> go<00:02:01.229> back<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.619> same<00:02:01.799> shape

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
it doesn't go back to the same shape

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.590 
it doesn't go back to the same shape
that<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.369> did<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.850> people<00:02:03.090> like<00:02:03.210> Meredith

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
that it did it and people like Meredith

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.480 
that it did it and people like Meredith
might<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:04.049> even<00:02:04.229> care<00:02:04.619> what<00:02:04.799> their<00:02:04.979> tattoos

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
might not even care what their tattoos

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.920 
might not even care what their tattoos
look<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:05.969> when<00:02:06.180> they're<00:02:06.299> old<00:02:06.509> and<00:02:06.750> gray

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
look like when they're old and gray

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.960 
look like when they're old and gray
because<00:02:07.170> by<00:02:07.500> then<00:02:07.799> they<00:02:08.220> may<00:02:08.429> come<00:02:08.729> with<00:02:08.879> an

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
because by then they may come with an

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.910 
because by then they may come with an
escape<00:02:09.360> clause<00:02:09.569> when<00:02:10.259> they're<00:02:10.379> trying<00:02:10.709> to

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
tattoos and it's like that's marking

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.830 
tattoos and it's like that's marking
times<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.220> places<00:02:38.370> in<00:02:38.670> their<00:02:38.819> life<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.720> it's
