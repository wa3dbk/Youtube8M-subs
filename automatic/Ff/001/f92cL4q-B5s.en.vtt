00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 hello today will be the top five products 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.569
 continued and this time have 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.580
 I picked out the medellÃ­n brand 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.980
 because it is now one of my 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.719
 favorite drugstore brands have become and 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.280
 I have them as only a few ago 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.520
 months discovered correctly for me but 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.920
 i can definitely say are are even 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.810
 more than five products in it very much 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.130
 I really liked it 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.630
 can recommend 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.310
 and that's why I would start then 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.810
 with the first thing that exists 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.269
 actually not so long that is 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.170
 namely one of these lips elixieren 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.079
 and i have the color 710 here and me 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.850
 think that's kind of like that 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:40.829
 Green tea smell a bit like that 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.879
 I like sweetened green tea like me 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.680
 That's a little bit if you do 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.640
 that applies to the lips I think 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.620
 The smell always comes a bit 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.090
 In the nose that bothers me so 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.190
 I have to say honestly but what 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.480
 I totally like those who really are 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.610
 Nursing effect so when I open it up 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.460
 have worn then give it to everyone 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.289
 if this elixir shines, it is 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.989
 not this silvestri money but it 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.329
 sticks spawn and flies very much 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.280
 Well, I think that's a nice one 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.939
 really good lip care product 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.950
 so to speak 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.900
 and now this color is the 710 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.220
 is not really that much color now 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.439
 on my lips 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.150
 I probably would or others 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.860
 you have to buy the one you see more 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.360
 my lips but I'm still very much 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.040
 satisfied with that because I just as 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.840
 lip care can abuse product 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.549
 or that works great with it 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.840
 I have some stronger colors myself 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.130
 not tested yet 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.840
 but I heard that she was one 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.100
 so a little bit over the lips 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.770
 This was natural 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.090
 not so nice but now the 710 so 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.070
 I can really recommend you because you can 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.720
 actually looks like I really 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.909
 and then the next 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.070
 These are foundations and I already have 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.920
 Some things tested in the drugstore 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.479
 straight and so for my skin types find 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.630
 I find it very difficult in the drugstore 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.329
 because always in the course of time is the 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.890
 foundation so a bit drier and 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.299
 you can see the drunk 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.250
 so that's maybe on 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.799
 at the beginning when applying but not so 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.360
 so I'll tell you after 24 hours then 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.920
 Foundation usually does not look that way anymore 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.600
 good and the only drugstore 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.600
 foundation with me that not 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.670
 this is the foundation of 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.959
 medellÃ­n and indeed in this liquid 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.819
 form that is there again in the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.980
 pen form that I use quite willing to 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.260
 but compete now 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.690
 so for the whole face is on everyone 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.790
 the liquid form is perfect for that 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.060
 dry bonnet and I think she is 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.110
 very much all day long 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.450
 moisturizing or that way 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.180
 It looks greasy but it is actually 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.950
 very easily has a mediocre 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.690
 Covering actually quite right 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.370
 well as I think so I am very 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.959
 happy with the opacity and she 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.580
 makes a very nice skin picture 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:39.799
 I'm on it again today I have it 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.349
 mixed again but the 105 and once 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.000
 the 220 is somehow my combo 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.640
 and there I get over my perfect 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.230
 Sound out and therefore I can for all 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.629
 girls who have my skin type 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.970
 really in the drugstore the liquid 

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.500
 Never very much recommend the fit 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.480
 I have the next product twice 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.549
 These are these master priests 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.099
 as a donator that's these liquid 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:03.079
 eyeliner and one I had given 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:04.670
 When I get this make up book from 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.540
 bought media there was one 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.250
 for free 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.829
 that's why I have two, but it's whole 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.709
 Well, that's not too long now 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:15.500
 and the good thing about them is that they are 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:17.599
 really a very small felt-tip pen 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.299
 have a great time and I love it with you 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.669
 to paint felt pen tips and that is 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.190
 really very fine and pointed at the 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:27.410
 end without being too churning so one 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.180
 can so very, very great draw the 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.099
 The only thing that bothers me sometimes is me 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.480
 think there is really a yes 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:34.130
 a little bit empty but for the 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.410
 drogerie is that really one of the very 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.540
 Precisely times when the color really 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.609
 until the evening stops until you look 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.319
 make-up again and that's why I like it 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:44.329
 very very much and if when I 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.220
 because one time wear then I grab 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:48.049
 always very happy to be here next 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.609
 I have two times and I think so 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.590
 that it's no surprise that I do that 

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:54.530
 I show that is namely the tri im 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.299
 taj leaf colors in germany believe 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.829
 I only have these two as far as I am 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.879
 I'm not mistaken otherwise I would wake up 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:00.650
 in any case , the other colors 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:02.269
 but I always have only those 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.629
 both seen in the stand and 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:08.030
 although once the color 04 and the 0 2 and 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.530
 they are a bit different 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.940
 easy so I believe you have to 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.459
 not necessarily both now but have 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.829
 to like that so much is just the 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:18.260
 texture and usually I come yes 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.419
 Not at all clear with cream blanches 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:23.090
 So that will always be totally stained 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.080
 It always gets too much for me and I get it 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.980
 not that nice anymore 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.720
 blinded and 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.210
 in the not so I think that they 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.680
 Also a bit of consistency 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.000
 yourself and how so I order it I 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.300
 So always take one 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.790
 right plague is so three times 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:39.620
 types in and then I connect that and 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.180
 that is also really wonderful 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:45.560
 blind and I think that is due 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.530
 this light music very creamy texture 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.300
 So it's a special texture 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.090
 and she is really great 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.530
 So blind without edges and without that 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.750
 is somehow also looks after greenwich 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.340
 and sole bar is me personally 

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.350
 has not happened yet and I am 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.590
 yes, they really like to be on top 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.870
 blush pressure lies then I have now 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.090
 three more products because I'm just three 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.860
 have colors of it and that are that 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.750
 I had these color tattoos 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.820
 really for a while every day 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:15.290
 used and really tried very hard too 

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:17.180
 because they are really really good 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.390
 are and I wear today again 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.040
 these folders bronx the color 35 

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.690
 moments lies on a make-up table 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.300
 because actually I have four 

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:28.730
 piece of it I just noticed and 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.800
 This brown which I like very much as 

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:32.720
 it's a really strong dark one 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:34.460
 brown you can also do it 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.930
 Apply a little easier so if 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.640
 you keep a little less product 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.200
 then it really is just such a breath 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.810
 and looks very good 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.400
 and it's just the perfect eyeshadow 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.750
 I also have a lot of bay city 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:47.930
 can definitely recommend the 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.220
 oro you golden the 65 you can too 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.740
 use if, for example more 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.600
 so rosÃ© sun eyeshadow afterwards 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.370
 I would like to wear but I also from 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.740
 many hear that they are this color 

00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:59.660
 tattoos for example as eyeliner and 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.250
 work very well too 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.800
 works because they really are 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:05.540
 good hold on the eye and actually missing 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.640
 Another product that I absolutely have to go into 

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:09.740
 this video should have shown 

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.660
 that's my team lumi touch 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:13.910
 concealer and I have so unfortunately 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.710
 misplaced lost i do not know it me 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.280
 am always hoping and do not give 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.170
 on 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:20.030
 but that is really a top 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.790
 concealer that really covers very well 

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.590
 and yes that really makes a great 

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:26.540
 Skin on the eye and I had the 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:28.400
 color two more, it also has a lot 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.140
 Well, that was a bit darker 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.970
 because otherwise all concealer in one 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.530
 we drogerie usually a bit too 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.880
 bright and I do not like it that much 

00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:36.530
 if that is to light here 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.780
 it's kind of funny, too 

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.370
 one likes to stop this area but too 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:42.230
 a lot is just not always good 

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:43.550
 And those were the products I had 

00:06:42.230 --> 00:06:45.350
 hope there were a few again 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:47.180
 inspirations for you 

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:48.800
 I like your tip if I have something 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:50.210
 so far he has overlooked him in the fog 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.220
 although I always do a lot 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:54.470
 spend time i love this 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.880
