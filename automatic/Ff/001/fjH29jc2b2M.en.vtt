00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.879 

I<00:00:06.390> have<00:00:07.390> one<00:00:07.600> this<00:00:07.750> is<00:00:07.960> Jason<00:00:08.380> from<00:00:08.410> backpack

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
I have one this is Jason from backpack

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.400 
I have one this is Jason from backpack
fly<00:00:09.130> fishing<00:00:09.490> comm<00:00:09.850> and<00:00:10.059> this<00:00:10.510> is<00:00:10.809> the<00:00:11.200> go<00:00:11.350> to

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
fly fishing comm and this is the go to

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.170 
fly fishing comm and this is the go to
midge<00:00:11.740> and<00:00:12.010> I<00:00:12.370> call<00:00:12.549> it<00:00:12.610> the<00:00:12.670> go<00:00:12.820> to<00:00:12.879> midge

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:13.180 
midge and I call it the go to midge

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.150 
midge and I call it the go to midge
because<00:00:13.630> it's<00:00:14.170> probably<00:00:14.559> the<00:00:14.650> number<00:00:14.950> one

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 
because it's probably the number one

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.830 
because it's probably the number one
midge<00:00:15.460> pattern<00:00:15.820> I<00:00:15.910> reach<00:00:16.090> for<00:00:16.119> when<00:00:16.630> there's<00:00:16.750> a

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:16.840 
midge pattern I reach for when there's a

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.870 
midge pattern I reach for when there's a
mid<00:00:17.050> touch<00:00:17.230> very<00:00:17.950> simple<00:00:18.250> to<00:00:18.340> tie<00:00:18.490> as<00:00:18.550> you<00:00:18.759> can

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:18.880 
mid touch very simple to tie as you can

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.159 
mid touch very simple to tie as you can
see<00:00:19.029> it's<00:00:19.180> a<00:00:19.270> Palomino<00:00:19.779> style<00:00:20.189> midge<00:00:21.189> and<00:00:22.169> one

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:23.169 
see it's a Palomino style midge and one

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:24.240 
see it's a Palomino style midge and one
of<00:00:23.259> the<00:00:23.320> things<00:00:23.529> that<00:00:23.770> makes<00:00:23.950> this<00:00:24.099> a<00:00:24.160> little

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
of the things that makes this a little

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:25.889 
of the things that makes this a little
bit<00:00:24.399> different<00:00:24.759> is<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.119> body<00:00:25.329> I'll<00:00:25.720> talk

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:25.899 
bit different is the body I'll talk

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:27.389 
bit different is the body I'll talk
about<00:00:25.930> the<00:00:26.230> body<00:00:26.410> material<00:00:26.860> in<00:00:26.950> a<00:00:27.009> minute<00:00:27.220> here

00:00:27.389 --> 00:00:27.399 
about the body material in a minute here

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:29.249 
about the body material in a minute here
and<00:00:27.880> then<00:00:28.029> also<00:00:28.239> the<00:00:28.480> type<00:00:28.660> of<00:00:28.689> hook<00:00:28.960> I<00:00:29.050> use

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
and then also the type of hook I use

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.519 
and then also the type of hook I use
normally<00:00:29.770> people<00:00:30.040> use<00:00:30.279> a<00:00:30.579> curved<00:00:30.880> hook<00:00:31.149> like<00:00:31.419> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
normally people use a curved hook like a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.069 
normally people use a curved hook like a
TMC<00:00:32.670> 2457<00:00:33.670> or<00:00:33.820> something<00:00:34.120> like<00:00:34.210> that<00:00:34.270> however

00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:35.079 
TMC 2457 or something like that however

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.520 
TMC 2457 or something like that however
I<00:00:35.290> use<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:35.829> TMC<00:00:36.480> 2488<00:00:37.480> and<00:00:37.870> it's<00:00:38.170> a<00:00:38.289> very<00:00:38.469> short

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
I use the TMC 2488 and it's a very short

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:40.380 
I use the TMC 2488 and it's a very short
shank<00:00:39.039> hook<00:00:39.219> and<00:00:39.460> the<00:00:39.760> reason<00:00:40.030> I<00:00:40.089> like<00:00:40.239> that

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
shank hook and the reason I like that

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.150 
shank hook and the reason I like that
better<00:00:40.600> for<00:00:40.870> this<00:00:40.960> style<00:00:41.170> of<00:00:41.320> fly<00:00:41.530> is<00:00:41.589> because

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
better for this style of fly is because

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:44.400 
better for this style of fly is because
as<00:00:42.429> you<00:00:42.789> notice<00:00:43.179> the<00:00:43.300> thorax<00:00:43.719> is<00:00:43.870> pretty<00:00:44.109> thick

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:44.410 
as you notice the thorax is pretty thick

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.079 
as you notice the thorax is pretty thick
and<00:00:44.440> if<00:00:44.649> you've<00:00:44.769> got<00:00:44.890> a<00:00:44.949> curved<00:00:45.309> hook<00:00:45.609> that

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:46.089 
and if you've got a curved hook that

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:47.729 
and if you've got a curved hook that
tends<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.570> kind<00:00:46.749> of<00:00:46.809> close<00:00:47.050> the<00:00:47.260> gap<00:00:47.440> of<00:00:47.649> the

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
tends to kind of close the gap of the

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.860 
tends to kind of close the gap of the
hook<00:00:47.859> a<00:00:47.949> little<00:00:48.039> bit<00:00:48.249> but<00:00:48.850> with<00:00:49.420> this<00:00:49.539> kind<00:00:49.839> of

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
hook a little bit but with this kind of

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.060 
hook a little bit but with this kind of
hook<00:00:50.050> you've<00:00:50.230> got<00:00:50.320> a<00:00:50.350> very<00:00:50.530> short<00:00:50.710> shank

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
hook you've got a very short shank

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.770 
hook you've got a very short shank
meaning<00:00:51.429> more<00:00:51.640> of<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:51.850> body<00:00:52.030> is<00:00:52.239> off<00:00:52.449> the<00:00:52.659> hook

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
meaning more of the body is off the hook

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.790 
meaning more of the body is off the hook
so<00:00:53.019> it's<00:00:53.109> a<00:00:53.140> little<00:00:53.289> bit<00:00:53.379> more<00:00:53.469> realistic

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
so it's a little bit more realistic

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.439 
so it's a little bit more realistic
looking<00:00:54.249> plus<00:00:54.730> it<00:00:54.850> doesn't<00:00:55.089> interfere<00:00:55.269> with

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:55.449 
looking plus it doesn't interfere with

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.389 
looking plus it doesn't interfere with
the<00:00:55.690> gap<00:00:55.809> of<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.019> hook<00:00:56.170> so<00:00:56.739> let's<00:00:57.190> go<00:00:57.339> ahead

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:57.399 
the gap of the hook so let's go ahead

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.410 
the gap of the hook so let's go ahead
and<00:00:57.489> see<00:00:57.670> how<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.819> tie<00:00:57.999> one<00:01:00.059> once<00:01:01.059> again<00:01:01.210> your

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
and see how to tie one once again your

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.090 
and see how to tie one once again your
thread<00:01:01.659> started<00:01:02.050> the<00:01:02.230> first<00:01:02.440> step<00:01:02.649> is<00:01:02.829> to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
thread started the first step is to

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.070 
thread started the first step is to
construct<00:01:03.550> the<00:01:03.640> body<00:01:03.819> now<00:01:04.330> I<00:01:04.360> like<00:01:04.750> to<00:01:04.930> use

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
construct the body now I like to use

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.219 
construct the body now I like to use
ultra<00:01:05.710> chenille<00:01:06.340> micro<00:01:06.850> from<00:01:07.240> hair<00:01:07.479> line<00:01:07.659> just

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:08.229 
ultra chenille micro from hair line just

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:09.570 
ultra chenille micro from hair line just
because<00:01:08.409> this<00:01:08.560> a<00:01:08.590> little<00:01:08.740> bit<00:01:08.890> denser<00:01:09.280> than

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
because this a little bit denser than

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.430 
because this a little bit denser than
some<00:01:10.030> of<00:01:10.090> the<00:01:10.180> things<00:01:10.360> other<00:01:10.570> people<00:01:10.900> use<00:01:11.080> like

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
some of the things other people use like

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.100 
some of the things other people use like
magic<00:01:12.430> dub<00:01:12.580> or<00:01:12.730> easy<00:01:12.910> dub<00:01:13.150> you<00:01:13.390> can<00:01:13.780> see<00:01:13.930> this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
magic dub or easy dub you can see this

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.750 
magic dub or easy dub you can see this
is<00:01:14.260> pretty<00:01:14.410> coarse<00:01:14.770> doesn't<00:01:15.340> look<00:01:15.460> much<00:01:15.700> like

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
is pretty coarse doesn't look much like

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.760 
is pretty coarse doesn't look much like
an<00:01:16.060> insect<00:01:16.360> body<00:01:16.570> to<00:01:16.840> me<00:01:16.960> this<00:01:17.470> is<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:17.620> little

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
an insect body to me this is a little

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.170 
an insect body to me this is a little
bit<00:01:17.860> better<00:01:17.980> especially<00:01:18.520> once<00:01:18.730> you<00:01:18.790> burn<00:01:19.000> it

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
bit better especially once you burn it

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:20.940 
bit better especially once you burn it
so<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.810> first<00:01:20.050> step<00:01:20.230> is<00:01:20.380> to<00:01:20.500> take<00:01:20.650> a<00:01:20.710> length

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
so the first step is to take a length

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.510 
so the first step is to take a length
and<00:01:21.900> really<00:01:22.900> quickly<00:01:23.320> just<00:01:23.710> touch<00:01:23.950> lighter<00:01:24.280> to

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
and really quickly just touch lighter to

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.670 
and really quickly just touch lighter to
it<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:25.000> what's<00:01:25.840> like<00:01:25.990> what<00:01:26.290> that's<00:01:26.440> going<00:01:26.590> to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
it and what's like what that's going to

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.100 
it and what's like what that's going to
do<00:01:26.830> is<00:01:27.100> make<00:01:27.400> a<00:01:27.430> really<00:01:27.700> nice<00:01:27.910> finely<00:01:28.690> tapered

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
do is make a really nice finely tapered

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.350 
do is make a really nice finely tapered
body<00:01:29.290> to<00:01:29.560> it<00:01:29.710> very<00:01:30.250> sleek<00:01:30.580> looks<00:01:30.910> like<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.120> real

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
body to it very sleek looks like a real

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.020 
body to it very sleek looks like a real
insect<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.260> if<00:01:33.070> you<00:01:33.220> want<00:01:33.460> you<00:01:33.580> can<00:01:33.670> even<00:01:33.760> put

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:34.030 
insect and if you want you can even put

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.760 
insect and if you want you can even put
the<00:01:34.120> kind<00:01:34.240> of<00:01:34.330> like<00:01:34.450> a<00:01:34.510> little<00:01:34.660> crimp<00:01:35.350> into<00:01:35.620> it

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
the kind of like a little crimp into it

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.230 
the kind of like a little crimp into it
to<00:01:35.890> make<00:01:36.010> it<00:01:36.130> look<00:01:36.160> like<00:01:36.400> it's<00:01:36.580> moving<00:01:36.850> and

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
to make it look like it's moving and

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.490 
to make it look like it's moving and
this<00:01:37.420> does<00:01:37.600> move<00:01:37.840> a<00:01:37.900> little<00:01:37.990> bit<00:01:38.110> in<00:01:38.230> the<00:01:38.290> water

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
this does move a little bit in the water

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.250 
this does move a little bit in the water
so<00:01:39.220> I<00:01:40.030> just<00:01:40.540> think<00:01:40.690> that<00:01:40.810> makes<00:01:40.960> it<00:01:41.080> look<00:01:41.170> a

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
so I just think that makes it look a

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.200 
so I just think that makes it look a
little<00:01:41.320> bit<00:01:41.470> more<00:01:41.560> realistic<00:01:41.940> so<00:01:42.940> let's<00:01:43.090> go

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
little bit more realistic so let's go

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.820 
little bit more realistic so let's go
ahead<00:01:43.390> and<00:01:43.570> attach<00:01:43.810> that<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.230> body<00:01:44.470> it

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
ahead and attach that to the body it

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.250 
ahead and attach that to the body it
should<00:01:45.280> extend<00:01:45.790> about<00:01:46.360> two-thirds<00:01:46.990> of<00:01:47.140> the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
should extend about two-thirds of the

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:53.010 
should extend about two-thirds of the
way<00:01:47.380> off<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:48.510> shank<00:01:49.510> of<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.690> hook<00:01:51.810> let<00:01:52.810> down<00:01:52.990> a

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
way off the shank of the hook let down a

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.820 
way off the shank of the hook let down a
few<00:01:53.260> times<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.800> then<00:01:53.950> cut<00:01:54.280> off<00:01:54.310> the<00:01:54.430> excess

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.650 

now<00:01:59.830> go<00:02:00.070> ahead<00:02:00.160> and<00:02:00.310> attach<00:02:00.970> a<00:02:01.210> length<00:02:01.450> of

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
now go ahead and attach a length of

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.630 
now go ahead and attach a length of
polypropylene<00:02:02.290> yarn<00:02:02.860> this<00:02:03.190> is<00:02:03.250> gonna<00:02:03.490> be

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
polypropylene yarn this is gonna be

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.520 
polypropylene yarn this is gonna be
folded<00:02:04.060> over<00:02:04.300> toward<00:02:04.600> the<00:02:04.720> ID<00:02:04.810> the<00:02:05.020> hook<00:02:05.170> so

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
folded over toward the ID the hook so

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:07.350 
folded over toward the ID the hook so
you<00:02:06.010> want<00:02:06.160> to<00:02:06.220> wrap<00:02:06.340> it<00:02:06.370> back<00:02:06.640> right<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.240> the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
you want to wrap it back right to the

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.250 
you want to wrap it back right to the
point<00:02:07.570> where<00:02:07.900> you<00:02:08.789> ended<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:10.030> tie<00:02:10.420> in<00:02:10.629> for<00:02:10.989> the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
point where you ended the tie in for the

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.949 
point where you ended the tie in for the
body<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.489> then<00:02:13.000> cut<00:02:13.180> off<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.480> excess<00:02:13.749> in<00:02:13.930> the

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
body and then cut off the excess in the

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.110 
body and then cut off the excess in the
front<00:02:14.790> now<00:02:15.790> we're<00:02:15.969> ready<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.239> add<00:02:16.480> the<00:02:16.599> thorax

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
front now we're ready to add the thorax

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.180 
front now we're ready to add the thorax
for<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.209> forex<00:02:19.599> I<00:02:19.780> like<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.140> use<00:02:20.290> ice<00:02:20.560> dub<00:02:20.890> in

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
for the forex I like to use ice dub in

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.339 
for the forex I like to use ice dub in
the<00:02:21.220> olive<00:02:21.700> brown<00:02:21.909> color<00:02:22.209> you<00:02:22.959> could<00:02:23.170> use

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
the olive brown color you could use

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:26.009

peacock<00:02:23.769> herl<00:02:23.980> but<00:02:24.340> this<00:02:24.730> synthetic<00:02:25.420> dubbing

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
peacock herl but this synthetic dubbing

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.979 
peacock herl but this synthetic dubbing
almost<00:02:26.620> kind<00:02:26.830> of<00:02:26.860> has<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.220> same<00:02:27.989> translucent

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
almost kind of has the same translucent

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.199 
almost kind of has the same translucent
effect<00:02:29.560> but<00:02:30.040> it<00:02:30.459> also<00:02:30.580> gives<00:02:30.849> you<00:02:30.970> a<00:02:31.030> little

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
effect but it also gives you a little

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.059 
effect but it also gives you a little
bit<00:02:31.390> more<00:02:31.690> action<00:02:32.409> in<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.500> water<00:02:32.769> you<00:02:32.920> get<00:02:33.010> a

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
bit more action in the water you get a

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:34.530 
bit more action in the water you get a
bunch<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.370> little<00:02:33.580> spikes<00:02:33.879> to<00:02:34.090> come<00:02:34.209> off<00:02:34.360> at

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
bunch of little spikes to come off at

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.140 
bunch of little spikes to come off at
that<00:02:34.690> look<00:02:34.840> like<00:02:34.989> things<00:02:35.230> like<00:02:35.409> legs<00:02:35.709> or<00:02:36.150> some

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
that look like things like legs or some

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.740 
that look like things like legs or some
kind<00:02:37.360> of<00:02:38.519> emergence<00:02:39.519> so<00:02:40.299> it's<00:02:40.480> a<00:02:40.510> little<00:02:40.659> bit

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
kind of emergence so it's a little bit

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.990 
kind of emergence so it's a little bit
more<00:02:40.870> animated<00:02:41.440> than<00:02:41.620> just<00:02:42.459> regular<00:02:42.640> peat

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
more animated than just regular peat

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.069 
more animated than just regular peat

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
brush back all your fibers so you have a

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.390 
brush back all your fibers so you have a
clean<00:02:52.750> eye<00:02:52.780> on<00:02:52.989> when<00:02:53.109> you're<00:02:53.230> done<00:02:53.349> then<00:02:54.040> just

fold over the polypropylene yarn and
make<00:02:57.970> a<00:02:58.000> few<00:02:58.209> turns<00:02:58.450> over<00:02:59.230> that<00:03:03.900> then<00:03:04.900> pull<00:03:05.170> it

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
make a few turns over that then pull it

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.309 
make a few turns over that then pull it
back<00:03:05.319> and<00:03:05.799> wrap<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.489> little<00:03:07.000> bit<00:03:07.180> in<00:03:07.480> front<00:03:08.260> of

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
back and wrap a little bit in front of

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.930 
back and wrap a little bit in front of
the<00:03:08.409> eye<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:09.010> that<00:03:09.040> it<00:03:09.280> sticks<00:03:09.519> up<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:09.790> little

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
the eye so that it sticks up a little

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:23.240 
the eye so that it sticks up a little
bit<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.780> then<00:03:11.349> whip<00:03:11.560> finish

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
cut off the excess and you're pretty

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.209 
cut off the excess and you're pretty
much<00:03:26.769> done<00:03:27.750> okay<00:03:28.750> so<00:03:28.810> that's<00:03:29.319> how<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.829> tie<00:03:30.159> the
