00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.570

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.160
 evening I could not turn it in fact 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.990
 in the afternoon when there was still the 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.939
 natural light but I came back with 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.100

 obviously they make a very very video 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.989
 interesting concerning precisely the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.780
 cosmetics 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:06.540

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.130
 big kiss I thank you for that 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.040
 continuous of this collaboration 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.229
 you know that I am very happy by now 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.390
 keep doing it and very very proud 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.890
 just to turn them around with two 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.650
 people 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.630
 truly exquisite as we have today 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.050
 decided to tell you about the top ranking 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.630
 3 of the face bases then to show you i 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.460
 products that we recommend with 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.369
 which we found particularly 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.080
 good of the ria just at the face the la 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.140
 We have chosen the basic face category 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.159
 specially very large in such a way 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.170
 to be able to include if we want also 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.740
 besides foundation also baby first creams 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.380
 colored 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.450
 so we have a wide choice of 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.899
 products that you can include in such a way 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.550
 to be precise possible three products 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.550
 that I will go show her not three 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.750
 products that I have specially chosen 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:59.820
 different from each other therefore both as 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.100
 wording that how it ends that too 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.050
 as a product in itself quite different 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.110
 in such a way as to be able to range a little 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.119
 more in this field and they are all three 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.340
 very suitable products for the skin 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.880
 fat therefore because to the skin anyway 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.100
 mixed fat with tendency to the 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.810
 mention the area t just because I 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.550
 precisely this type of skin 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.320
 the first product in the ranking that you 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.470
 I'm going to show you sorry but maybe 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.590
 I will also be repetitive and this is the 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.060
 This garnier's bb cream is here 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.430
 the one with the tube long enough 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.769
 therefore practically the baby climate given 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.950
 for mixed and oily skin and mine and 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.480
 in the medium shade it costs on 7 10 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.360
 euro the price seems but if to the 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.810
 supermarkets or perfumeries anyway 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:47.640
 continue 40 ml of product and have one 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.950
 12 month deadline 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.959
 I love this product as for one 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.730
 very very high blanket in my opinion 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.310
 also comparable to the classics 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.260
 liquid foundation but I also love 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.810
 especially because despite his 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.579
 covering really a formulation 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.420
 indeed very light indeed extends 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:08.040
 a bb ferin therefore this combination of 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.230
 property factors but I like it 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.930
 very much more being very light 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.609
 does not occlude many errors therefore no names 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.580
 it is heavy on the face not speed 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.010
 absolutely 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.740
 obviously I always go to fix it 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:23.510
 with nuts transparent figures plan for 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.080
 regarding the duration to me lasts 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.850
 quietly even 6 8 hours as 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.120
 use to go to university e 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:34.400
 however on dos tres on the wind scooter 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.830
 hot cold has always lasted me not 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.080
 go ever given problems and the baby cream 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.730
 therefore overall very valid that between 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.410
 the other accompanies me both during 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.740
 summer time I don't want 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.080
 very heavy liquid foundation 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.760
 but also in the winter period as 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.040
 to a last excellent covering therefore it is a 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.209
 product that is recommended to use 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.790
 really at all times of the year 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.709
 also for this I work a lot the 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:00.080
 the second product I want to talk about is 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:02.630
 this is a mineral foundation here 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.820
 I'm sorry about snow cosmetics 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:06.800
 all the writing is canceled anyway 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.480
 I have it in the entando coloring of 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.459
 check as you see is very much 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.890
 used on almost half the product 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:15.380
 contains eight grams of product for one 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:18.500
 12-month expiration from the opening on 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.660
 price of 13 euros and availability 90 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.739
 of this product is a bit of a counter 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.750
 because you can buy it anyway 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.520
 only on the online site 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:27.740
 however on the cosmetics website o 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.630
 also on the bio perfumeries they believe 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.790
 this with this online brand a 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.040
 mineral foundation with a good win 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.860
 in fact the snow cosmetics for those who are not 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.440
 knew a brand that has products 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.450
 cruelty free and above all with indexes 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:43.460
 super super green so great not there 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.560
 still creates situations on the face and 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.120
 mineral powder free therefore suitable 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.690
 indicated above all because to the skins 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:53.240
 fat and is very very light indeed 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:55.100
 it is usable above all is recommended 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:58.370
 use especially during the 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.380
 summer time is very light and therefore 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:01.520
 the coverage turns out to be however 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.390
 medium-low 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.760
 I used it quietly 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:08.120
 during the whole summer period during 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.040
 this summer it is applied with a brush 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:12.500
 with a suitable brush especially me 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.120
 I use the mini kabuki 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.130
 if that a brush that has no titles 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:19.160
 very dense there really found 

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.260
 super super good because at the beginning I do it 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.970
 I used to use a flash cookie 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:25.480
 of the bristles very very compact and 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.800
 then let me face a lot 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.480
 stains instead used with the 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:31.250
 suitable brush can give you a 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.440
 good opacity blacks were sa 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.600
 perfectly the face and why chosen a 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.060
 cover minimum minimal imperfections 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.130
 obviously it is a little foundation anyway 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:43.090
 covering therefore recommended to those who have 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.590
 many many imperfection problems 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:47.570
 but they really have very light 

00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:49.820
 absolutely feel on your face then a 

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:51.710
 I loved it during my time 

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:53.270
 summer saved me in all 

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:56.360
 occasions in fact I also brought it in 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.980
 vacation with me and then red for 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.410
 passed side and is therefore a foundation 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.030
 which I absolutely recommend 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:04.010
 third and final foundation of which there is 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:06.380
 I want to talk about is this one of the 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:09.830
 essence which is called soft touch rus 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:13.370
 make up this here that I have is in the 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.560
 coloring 08 martin contains sixteen 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:18.860
 grams of product for a deadline of 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:23.090
 24 months after opening and the price is 3 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.550
 euro and 99 the product itself here it is 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:27.650
 as you can see it is almost finished 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.870
 mousse foundation has a consistency 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.760
 really very very particular because 

00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:33.860
 to the touch seeds a cremosano once 

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.190
 lying on the skin turns out to be with 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.210
 you end up in dust so this is it here 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.580
 very suitable especially for those who have the 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.500
 oily skin that tends to shine because 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.530
 you rainer really velvety face 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.030
 hellmuth long is a super foundation 

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:50.150
 low cost but I think it has one 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.220
 really good quality is the very thing 

00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:54.350
 very good of this foundation that 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:56.210
 however the medium-high opacity 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.830
 so it's a product that I recommend 

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:59.720
 especially to use during the 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.700
 winter period as much 

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:04.900
 covering and also quite enough 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:07.520
 heavy leaves the face so truly 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.710
 overvalued without much imperfections 

00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:11.750
 smooth is indeed very often is not 

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.860
 not even necessary to apply to one 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.210
 face powder 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:17.190
 the duration lasted 

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:19.380
 that mind 56 hours so a duration 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:21.419
 however average a foundation that second 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.039
 me is usable especially for those 

00:07:21.419 --> 00:07:25.919
 special occasions where you want to have 

00:07:23.039 --> 00:07:28.590
 a really super super perfect face 

00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:30.419
 I have it, I love using it for years 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:33.360
 I've already bought two or three packs 

00:07:30.419 --> 00:07:36.060
 that if the umpteenth ending is 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.560
 really a product tear moved well 

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:39.990
 girls these were the three products 

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:42.090
 on the basic face category I wanted 

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.740
 show me let me know if you are me 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:45.660
 liked if you are interested 

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:47.190
 especially if you have one of these 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:49.770
 three products and how you are 

00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:52.380
 you know, I really like to compare myself 

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:54.870
 with you this the main reason for 

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:58.199
