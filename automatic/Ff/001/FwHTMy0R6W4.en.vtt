00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:05.210
 one of the reasons that the line sit but that did not go without a struggle 

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.700
 and now that we are 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.700
 maybe not at all 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.280
 Middelburg 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:21.460
 more later yes yes 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.319
 I can remember 2 

00:00:23.319 --> 00:00:26.539
 reached the initial phase a week earlier in the day 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.099
 beginning with the devices last year 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.689
 it's for the joke 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.820
 who do you know you have it then of course there are 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.070
 then not much of it is allowed 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.020
 9 it seems 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.850
 it happens 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.850
 top gear alphen on the Rhine 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.030
 two years for years 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.570
 How did you do that? I said what can and should remain 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.400
 but what then yes that is well decided makes it no more than logical 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.370
 does anyone have the same thing? 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.739
 what makes a performance to be sure it turns out that the reward for that 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.650
 The Netherlands 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.330
 I think I did the homework 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.330
 I also known as looking up the dressing room 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.020
 yes my dad oil stocks prot 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.640
 to contribute 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.010
 You are a good sense of the month 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.010
 I think wilders wanted to lease 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.640
 we wanted to donate 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.340
 after all, he did want the international cycling union 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.080
 decided in Brussels 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.080
 and therefore a minus of more than 4 percent 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.130
 too bad for death 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.130
 per violation 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.960
 feeling about being brought up 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.860
 especially with that I have government 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.220
 completely out of control 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.460
 condition was that the rebels 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.110
 hereby 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.600
 the company has now been together for more than a year 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.400
 this sustained 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.400
 yes but no more and death 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:11.369
 yes that is just part of it 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:12.429
 in total 

00:02:12.429 --> 00:02:15.199
 by the vehicle when it looks like that decision 

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:17.819
 what i am giving a little extra 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.889
 for the gates of bari 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.179
 the aging population 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:25.609
 that is also where her diaries make like music 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:26.889
 but 

00:02:26.889 --> 00:02:28.789
 Monday good 

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:32.549
 thursday you can do anything to the brewing group year 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.650
 we have many years if you do not make it well than one year 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.999
 earlier 

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:40.999
 We were heading a triple cup years old 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.799
 the sector 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.979
 the new yes 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:49.979
 the lab becomes the Netherlands 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.109
 western world 

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.759
 but we take it 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.149
 real madrid 

00:03:55.149 --> 00:03:56.859
 like me with ajax 

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.859
 do further 

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:05.989
 almeerse totally heppie but that doesn't help him not discouraged 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.819
 you would be yourself 

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:13.279
 yet the last place is finished 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:16.489
 I see it as the first half was a piece of meat that it is 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.729
 it took some searching 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.729
 photo can be seen 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:33.969
 according to the sources 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:36.969
 waxaar that would be fine 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:12.800
 the fifth 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.800
 and help with that 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:05:51.349
 a new trainer
