color and the smell of this the smell is
actually<00:02:13.010> it<00:02:14.120> didn't<00:02:15.120> bother<00:02:15.239> me<00:02:15.360> at<00:02:15.540> all<00:02:15.690> one

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
actually it didn't bother me at all one

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.420 
actually it didn't bother me at all one
thing<00:02:16.200> I<00:02:16.290> like<00:02:16.440> about<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.860> is<00:02:17.070> that<00:02:17.250> it's

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
thing I like about this is that it's

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.449 
thing I like about this is that it's
ammonia<00:02:17.850> free<00:02:18.209> and<00:02:18.709> it's<00:02:19.709> not<00:02:19.860> as<00:02:19.980> damaging<00:02:20.400> to

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
ammonia free and it's not as damaging to

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.210 
ammonia free and it's not as damaging to
your<00:02:20.700> hair<00:02:20.970> as<00:02:21.209> let's<00:02:22.080> say<00:02:22.350> like<00:02:22.650> I'm<00:02:22.800> coming

your hair as let's say like I'm coming

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.310 
your hair as let's say like I'm coming
in<00:02:23.370> because<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.730> semi-permanent<00:02:24.600> lasts

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:25.320 
in because the semi-permanent lasts

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.620 
in because the semi-permanent lasts
through<00:02:25.620> 20<00:02:26.040> shampoos<00:02:26.610> we'll<00:02:27.180> see<00:02:27.360> about<00:02:27.450> that

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
through 20 shampoos we'll see about that

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.850 
through 20 shampoos we'll see about that
but<00:02:28.080> I<00:02:28.470> just<00:02:29.250> like<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.790> coverage<00:02:30.360> is<00:02:30.600> just

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
but I just like the coverage is just

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:33.949 
but I just like the coverage is just
covered<00:02:31.860> up<00:02:31.980> all<00:02:32.220> of<00:02:32.670> the

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
covered up all of the
