00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
this one I can't quite see it being the

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.420 
this one I can't quite see it being the
case<00:02:18.150> because<00:02:18.450> really<00:02:18.989> when<00:02:19.650> I<00:02:19.709> boosted<00:02:20.280> this

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
case because really when I boosted this

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.460 
case because really when I boosted this
guy<00:02:20.670> starts<00:02:21.180> he<00:02:21.330> was<00:02:21.510> just<00:02:21.750> phenomenal<00:02:21.930> I

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
guy starts he was just phenomenal I

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:24.229 
guy starts he was just phenomenal I
think<00:02:22.739> the<00:02:23.220> thing<00:02:23.400> which<00:02:23.640> makes<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:24.030> play<00:02:24.209> a

00:02:24.229 --> 00:02:24.239 
think the thing which makes a play a

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.880 
think the thing which makes a play a
good<00:02:24.510> is<00:02:24.690> if<00:02:24.840> he's<00:02:24.989> already<00:02:25.200> a<00:02:25.349> relatively

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
good is if he's already a relatively

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.190 
good is if he's already a relatively
quick<00:02:26.220> player<00:02:26.489> great<00:02:26.879> but<00:02:27.420> Jackson's<00:02:27.870> already

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
quick player great but Jackson's already

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.530 
quick player great but Jackson's already
got<00:02:28.410> some<00:02:28.590> pretty<00:02:28.769> decent<00:02:29.069> shooting<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:29.910> he's

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
got some pretty decent shooting and he's

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.380
