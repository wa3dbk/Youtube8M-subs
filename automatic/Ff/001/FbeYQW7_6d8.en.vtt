00:00:00.959 --> 00:00:04.830
 and to compact 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.219
 my old is a tipa julia 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:18.690
 my mom's boyfriend calls me to see one 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.880
 it's always very fast but still 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.119
 watching TV with my husband so the 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.310
 al qaida's husband 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:31.820
 good they had me your mom in Paraguay 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.820

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.140
 because I told him but it's all good 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.140
 fine but actually 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.579
 and then by calling it, do not leave me the same 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.949
 supposedly good with the cell phone and I 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.950
 he attended and I reassure him he has seen 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:55.630
 that nothing ever happens 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.120
 to look with the police station happy 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:01.740
 all right all right I'm here and I slept 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.740
 better than in the hotel that always 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.340
 the national pride vall dynasty 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:12.190
 julieta bal your daughter 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.420
 I 'm not unfortunately not angry 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.280
 with me 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.310
 he left he kept talking in the media 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.670
 even when writing a book if it is one 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.780
 of the systems that got we look 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.100
 now let's say what do you get these 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.869
 bad is also still being 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.580
 putting things together so people are going to 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.030
 speak badly and get things that good 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.150
 type santiago 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.790
 I think if you think how I think what 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.509
 you know a lot I do not know about him I think 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.360
 that yes it is a good person if 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.920
 our experience with you as well as how 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.990
 I'm asking in general that a 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.340
 person I think yes vote in a skill 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:53.000
 personal 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.000
 it is good people 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.479
 but 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.460
 of plastic a present aroma versus 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.650
 past debates continue in the bureau of 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.390
 our first of 678 and this time it was 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.220
 the turn of the deputy roberto feletti and 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.570
 ricardo lopez murphy to the minister 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.580
 of economy of the government of de la rÃºa 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.040
 which among other things reduced the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.140
 educational budget seems to me or 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.980
 is more pessimistic than the murphy of the 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.730
 laws 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.560
 the balance of mine is necessarily a 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.020
 negative balance because after 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.260
 so many years of fortunate circumstances 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.510
 in the accumulation of problems I think 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:32.770
 that is revealing a problem of 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.440
 horizon management and ultimately 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.930
 instance also of ability to 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:41.350
 take advantage of those circumstances so 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.900
 ventures the government that started in the 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.610
 2003 received the country of crisis more 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.380
 deep that has had I say we received a 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:53.050
 country in default with a voluminous debt 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:56.230
 we received a country with 23 percent of 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:59.320
 open unemployment today is 7% we receive a 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.870
 country that only 67 percent of the 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.100
 passive population had coverage 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.430
 previsual today they have it 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.670
 of the 90 is to say after a cycle that 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:12.160
 will be 10 years old not only there was rate 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.810
 of growth but also there was a 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.680
 process in which that rate of 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:20.840
 growth reached 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.840
 to huge layers of the population like 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:27.909
 messi pagani I killed him a month and today 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.609
 twitter but like all love and everything 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:35.230
 the respect he said told me that all the 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.819
 style was always the same but 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:43.120
 that everything he learned he learned 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:45.209
 the lower ones of Barcelona to run the 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.209
 ball 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:56.889
 good as any history 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.930
 maradona where he played without partners or 

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:01.090
 a nature in a success that will explain 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.799
 nothing plot now I need to have a 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:06.090
 technical like bilardo the world cup 86 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:06.090
 also a team
