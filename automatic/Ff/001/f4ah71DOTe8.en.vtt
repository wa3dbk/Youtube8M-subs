focusing<00:03:30.230> is<00:03:30.489> impressive<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:32.810> it's<00:03:33.020> not<00:03:33.200> a

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
focusing is impressive so it's not a

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:36.280 
focusing is impressive so it's not a
mass-market<00:03:33.860> camera<00:03:34.459> as<00:03:34.640> much<00:03:34.820> as<00:03:35.270> the<00:03:35.420> 70d<00:03:36.020> is

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.530 
mass-market camera as much as the 70d is
it's<00:03:36.860> more<00:03:37.100> targeted<00:03:37.610> but<00:03:37.790> for<00:03:38.090> those<00:03:38.239> folks

coming weeks and seeing some

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.790 
coming weeks and seeing some
side-by-sides<00:03:47.030> it's<00:03:47.750> certainly<00:03:48.170> bigger<00:03:48.560> it's

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
side-by-sides it's certainly bigger it's

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.410

hard<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.070> tell<00:03:49.250> because<00:03:49.340> the<00:03:49.550> 70d<00:03:50.060> right<00:03:50.269> now

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
hard to tell because the 70d right now

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:53.770 
hard to tell because the 70d right now
