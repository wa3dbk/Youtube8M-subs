00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:38.900 
batteries on the bottom but yet just

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.430 
batteries on the bottom but yet just
again<00:04:40.000> like<00:04:41.000> all<00:04:41.270> Doctor<00:04:41.690> Who<00:04:41.810> things<00:04:42.080> it<00:04:42.290> has

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
again like all Doctor Who things it has

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.010 
again like all Doctor Who things it has
to<00:04:42.620> be<00:04:42.770> those<00:04:43.010> weird<00:04:43.310> little<00:04:43.610> batteries<00:04:44.360> but

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
to be those weird little batteries but

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.630 
to be those weird little batteries but
now<00:04:45.230> we're<00:04:45.470> going<00:04:45.560> to<00:04:45.680> move<00:04:45.830> on<00:04:46.040> to<00:04:46.280> the<00:04:46.430> main

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:46.640 
now we're going to move on to the main

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:50.170 
now we're going to move on to the main
feature<00:04:47.380> basically<00:04:48.380> what<00:04:48.890> you<00:04:49.100> do<00:04:49.340> is<00:04:49.550> you

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
feature basically what you do is you

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.230 
feature basically what you do is you
there's<00:04:50.960> a<00:04:51.080> on<00:04:51.440> and<00:04:51.770> off<00:04:52.010> switch<00:04:52.340> whenever<00:04:53.000> you

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
there's a on and off switch whenever you

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.870 
there's a on and off switch whenever you
turn<00:04:53.480> this<00:04:53.660> on<00:04:53.870> you're<00:04:54.710> going<00:04:54.950> to<00:04:55.040> stand<00:04:55.490> it<00:04:55.700> up

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:55.880 
turn this on you're going to stand it up

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.570 
turn this on you're going to stand it up
and<00:04:56.120> the<00:04:56.990> TARDIS<00:04:57.550> slights<00:04:58.550> that<00:04:59.060> led<00:05:00.220> stays<00:05:01.220> on

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
and the TARDIS slights that led stays on

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.560 
and the TARDIS slights that led stays on
now<00:05:02.800> you<00:05:03.800> would<00:05:04.010> have<00:05:04.040> to<00:05:04.520> turn<00:05:04.730> it<00:05:04.910> repeatedly

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:05.570 
now you would have to turn it repeatedly

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.430 
now you would have to turn it repeatedly
on<00:05:05.780> and<00:05:06.500> off<00:05:06.740> for<00:05:07.670> that<00:05:07.820> effect<00:05:08.390> to<00:05:08.870> happen<00:05:09.260> if

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
on and off for that effect to happen if

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.550 
on and off for that effect to happen if
and<00:05:09.710> the<00:05:10.340> stop<00:05:10.610> motion<00:05:11.150> but<00:05:11.510> for<00:05:12.170> it<00:05:12.260> to<00:05:12.350> be<00:05:12.440> a

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
and the stop motion but for it to be a

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.680 
and the stop motion but for it to be a
stop<00:05:12.890> motion<00:05:13.100> it<00:05:13.640> would<00:05:14.060> be<00:05:14.750> very<00:05:15.020> cool<00:05:16.300> so<00:05:17.300> it

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:17.690 
stop motion it would be very cool so it

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.730 
stop motion it would be very cool so it
is<00:05:17.990> very<00:05:18.920> very<00:05:19.370> fun<00:05:19.760> to<00:05:19.970> play<00:05:20.180> with<00:05:20.420> and<00:05:20.690> I<00:05:21.410> like
