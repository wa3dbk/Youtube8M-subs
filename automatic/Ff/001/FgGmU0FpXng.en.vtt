00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.710
 video game with her the virtual 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.619

 i have a climb of nes nintendo 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:49.359
 What system are we going to start with? 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:52.239
 Normal pack pack with two joysticks am 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:55.059
 which is really the most common then 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:59.109
 they released the action pack it's with 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:01.359
 the father and the cartridge containing the 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.249
 Mario and mourning kent little story 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:07.240
 from the father for a little culture 

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:11.980
 the phaser the first father at the start 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.720
 it was dark gray and with we are not going 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.630
 to say a few problems but they have 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:22.060
 had concerns because and looked too much like 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.710
 a real weapon for that's why 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.870
 they did it orange red is 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:31.810
 disgusting for 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:38.130
 differentiate it as a day and pack 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.130
 mario 3 is actually it's the normal pack 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.010
 as I showed such time 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:48.670
 the really normal pack at the most rank 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.820
 current there is just the sheath besides 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.890
 there are some with the ninja turtles oven 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.780

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.570
 finally here's the inside it stays 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.130
 always the same thing then the 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.740
 little things or a little if you 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.590
 have already seen that when I bought it 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:12.010

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:15.370

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.850
