00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.770
 essentially there are two things that are at the base of communication 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.290
 photographic first as the photographer feels subject through 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.249
 their experiences their experiences 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:15.509
 and how he filters it and tries to transmit it in the photograph 

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:20.449
 when I photograph I can not do anything other than propose a reading key 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.419
 to the observer that after observing our images and that in turn the 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.239
 reinterpret through their own experiences and their set and their experiences 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.260
 the second of these things is the style with which photographer does it is to say 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.960
 as a background to the subject if you go to see a photographic exhibition what you 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.410
 is not so much what is portrayed in the photographs if they are the 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.510
 animals squares or people but as a photographer interpreted these subjects already 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.170
 modeled the light at will to make these photographs of the heroes the 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.320
 photographs to try to reproduce asofem is equal try to understand 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.800
 what were the photographer's intentions and how was the technique used to 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.560
 get these images 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.999
 for teachers it is very easy for beginners 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:05.540
 what we do is not easy as Ansel said adams in the first place 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:08.670
 important to learn to visualize previously is to say 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.860
 when you get the attention of your belongings photograph it 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.860
 try to understand how the final image will come out 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:20.340
 therefore it is necessary to imagine all the steps before the 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.680
 shoot until the print how your photo will come to the subject that these 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.700
 photographing 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.590
 it seems pretty simple 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.549
 It's not hard for me to visualize what I want if I do not get it 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:35.310
 the difficulty is surely often when you look at your photo you will be disappointed 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.470
 because you will not find what you've seen when you shoot up the photo 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.659
 but precisely for this reason 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:45.630
 the important thing is to learn the technique and not to do technical wonders or 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.310
 to make a well-made photo 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.160
 but simply to service your ideas but that you want to communicate to 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.560
 Through photography, photography happens mostly through what 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.090
 you feel what counts are the ideas 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.730
 therefore try to make a with the technique and then put into play 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.880
 also your experience your experiences your way of feeling reality so the 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.550
 previous visualization is the fruit of the mastery of the technical elements of 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.210
 all the steps of photography as well as the understanding of how light 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.860
 and all the other elements intervene when you shoot a photograph
