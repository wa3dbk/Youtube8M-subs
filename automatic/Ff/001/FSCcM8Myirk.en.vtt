00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.950 

like<00:01:15.950> to<00:01:16.100> twist<00:01:16.340> the<00:01:16.520> roots<00:01:16.760> that<00:01:17.150> way<00:01:17.660> all<00:01:17.900> of

like to twist the roots that way all of

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.210 
like to twist the roots that way all of
the<00:01:18.290> hair<00:01:18.530> can<00:01:18.770> get<00:01:18.860> into<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.430> hook<00:01:19.610> just

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:44.320 

glide<00:01:25.220> through

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.710 

remember<00:01:45.230> to<00:01:45.380> twist<00:01:45.620> first<00:01:46.010> hook<00:01:46.820> and<00:01:47.090> then

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
remember to twist first hook and then

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:53.020 
remember to twist first hook and then
pull<00:01:47.830> gently<00:01:48.830> I<00:01:51.100> find<00:01:52.100> that<00:01:52.220> using<00:01:52.370> a<00:01:52.580> pumping

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
pull gently I find that using a pumping

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.250 
pull gently I find that using a pumping
motion<00:01:53.420> helps<00:01:53.870> the<00:01:54.110> hair<00:01:54.290> glide<00:01:54.560> smoothly<00:01:59.260> for

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
motion helps the hair glide smoothly for

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:16.550 
motion helps the hair glide smoothly for
the<00:02:00.320> other<00:02:00.500> side<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:00.980> use<00:02:01.130> pink

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
once you get the hang of it it goes by

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.340 
once you get the hang of it it goes by
pretty<00:02:18.569> quickly<00:02:20.720> sometimes<00:02:21.720> we<00:02:21.959> gotta<00:02:22.140> try

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
pretty quickly sometimes we gotta try

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:42.679 
pretty quickly sometimes we gotta try
twice<00:02:22.650> or<00:02:22.890> three<00:02:23.040> times

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:42.689
