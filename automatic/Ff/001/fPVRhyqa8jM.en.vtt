00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.420 
so that's a really nice growing image of
their<00:02:32.420> logo<00:02:32.659> though<00:02:33.290> again<00:02:33.560> reinforces<00:02:34.340> the

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
their logo though again reinforces the

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.490 
their logo though again reinforces the
brand<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.909> finally<00:02:35.629> this<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.840> an<00:02:35.989> older<00:02:36.349> one

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
brand and finally this is an older one

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:43.360 
brand and finally this is an older one
from<00:02:36.950> st.<00:02:37.129> Barnabus<00:02:37.610> Anglican<00:02:38.150> Church<00:02:42.370> which

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
from st. Barnabus Anglican Church which

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.940 
from st. Barnabus Anglican Church which
is<00:02:43.489> what<00:02:43.640> the<00:02:43.760> old<00:02:43.909> building<00:02:44.239> was<00:02:47.950> again

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
is what the old building was again

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.599 
is what the old building was again
reinforcing<00:02:49.909> the<00:02:50.000> brand<00:02:50.269> of<00:02:50.510> these<00:02:50.840> churches

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
reinforcing the brand of these churches

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.250 
reinforcing the brand of these churches
so<00:02:52.609> I<00:02:52.640> think<00:02:52.819> that<00:02:53.299> a<00:02:53.329> video<00:02:53.510> production<00:02:53.930> logo

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
so I think that a video production logo

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.500 
so I think that a video production logo
used<00:02:54.680> on<00:02:54.829> videos<00:02:55.129> especially<00:02:55.790> if<00:02:55.909> you've<00:02:56.359> got

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
used on videos especially if you've got

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.539 
used on videos especially if you've got
a<00:02:56.540> YouTube<00:02:56.959> channel<00:02:57.319> or<00:02:57.439> regularly<00:02:57.950> uploading

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
a YouTube channel or regularly uploading

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.210 
a YouTube channel or regularly uploading
videos<00:02:58.909> of<00:02:59.150> sermons<00:02:59.659> it<00:03:00.200> can<00:03:00.500> be<00:03:00.620> very<00:03:00.859> easy<00:03:01.099> to

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
videos of sermons it can be very easy to

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.039 
videos of sermons it can be very easy to
do<00:03:01.459> and<00:03:01.700> I've<00:03:01.790> talked<00:03:02.090> about<00:03:02.209> three<00:03:02.690> levels

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
do and I've talked about three levels

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.250 
do and I've talked about three levels

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
beginner intermediate and advanced and

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.140 
beginner intermediate and advanced and
you<00:03:06.379> can<00:03:06.530> read<00:03:06.709> about<00:03:06.889> those<00:03:07.400> over<00:03:07.970> at<00:03:08.060> the
