00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.140
 informative video because good at last 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.030
 minecraft was going to be in the main thing 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.430
 which is great but good as 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.860
 unfortunately not many people have the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.300
 ability to go to a company to 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.420
 start you have to travel outside the country 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.160
 unless you're from london and apart is 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.530
 very clear because good guys if not 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.620
 you knew, I was already investigating 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:36.330
 and a ticket to the main with only one 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:39.270
 It costs 129 pounds which equals 202 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.640
 dollars and approximately 3 thousand 200 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.890
 weights like a little less but good 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.780
 three thousand one hundred and chubs pesos but 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.580
 good and that without obviously counting the 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.170
 I travel the hotel the meals and everyone is 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.910
 only that is the ticket for the main 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.430
 with maybe some will think that is 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:56.070
 quite expensive for me personally yes 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.450
 that is somewhat expensive 3200 pesos just for 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.220
 enter the main with ancona you can not 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.320
 enter the two days that is is that they are 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:03.150
 those who celebrate the mine with but good 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.760
 obviously I still do not know I do not tell 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:08.369
 with my ability my money and everything for 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.230
 to be able to go so good guys finally 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.000

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.920
 celebrated the mine 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.170
 since minecraft was going to have a panel 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.270
 special but I understand that in the 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.980
 Mine with pass but do not open me 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.930
 agreement where was it if they talked a little bit about 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.000
 minecraft and but honestly almost nobody 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.020
 he took attention speaks very few people in 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.760
 that conference they made of 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.920
 minecraft and only because I was 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.390
 johan and I remember very well but 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.920
 well there is a video out there hanging around 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.020
 the world team channel of youtube 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.850
 where can you find that they talked about 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.230
 of main crespin in the old look with 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.480
 he but good honestly I say no 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.040
 it was very very good that we say because 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.330
 it was when I found out he explains but to have 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.230
 things that what we were out there from the 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.940
 0.6 or 0.5 if I'm not wrong and well then 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.370
 I tell them it was not very interesting 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.320
 see minecraft and in that mini cut well 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.209
 what good guys finally wake up the 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:56.100
 life good guys would last 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.530
 a few days and several people had 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.450
 been since the boys these order 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.310
 of mantras for the creators of 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.190
 brains and so on and they were telling us 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:07.260
 here to see a panel in the mini with 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.940
 minecraft pocket edition and finally we 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.630
 they advertise well as well as here I have the 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.540
 screen image that the main with him 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.310
 celebrated by the pocket edition panel 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.090
 mainly make server with 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.330
 first you say 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:23.330
 that is to say is going to be the day 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:29.280
 forgiveness day Sunday at 3 30pm 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.890

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.989
 london and a great and very good thing is 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.120
 that good at least will be uploaded to youtube 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.730
 if we can not go obviously then I think 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:41.400
 that there is almost nobody of those who see me 

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.049
 can go to court then I still go 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.010
 to upload to youtube and as soon as you upload 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.780
 youtube then maybe do a good or 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.579
 see I'm going to see the extreme method 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.500

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.120
