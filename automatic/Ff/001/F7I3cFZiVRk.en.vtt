our<00:00:26.310> lowest<00:00:26.730> spot<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.180> probably<00:00:27.300> over<00:00:27.990> there

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
our lowest spot is probably over there

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.980 
our lowest spot is probably over there
or<00:00:28.439> over<00:00:28.500> here<00:00:28.680> we're<00:00:29.220> gonna<00:00:29.340> go<00:00:29.580> down

or over here we're gonna go down

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.110 
or over here we're gonna go down
essentially<00:00:30.990> about<00:00:31.199> six<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.710> eight<00:00:31.740> inches

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:32.120 
essentially about six to eight inches

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.630 
essentially about six to eight inches
we're<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.270> gonna<00:00:33.390> make<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.570> cut<00:00:33.930> we're<00:00:34.469> gonna

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
we're just gonna make a cut we're gonna

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.299 
we're just gonna make a cut we're gonna
come<00:00:35.640> in<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:35.940> again<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:37.070> to<00:00:38.070> kind<00:00:38.280> of

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
come in here again and to kind of

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.760 
come in here again and to kind of
continue<00:00:38.640> building<00:00:39.149> up<00:00:39.270> our<00:00:39.420> pad<00:00:39.750> basically<00:00:40.710> I

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
continue building up our pad basically I

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.979 
continue building up our pad basically I
think<00:00:41.070> if<00:00:41.129> we<00:00:41.219> just<00:00:41.399> all<00:00:41.610> jump<00:00:42.210> on<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.629> with

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
think if we just all jump on this with

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:55.330 
think if we just all jump on this with
buckets<00:00:43.469> shovels<00:00:43.890> picks<00:00:47.239> as<00:00:48.239> we<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:49.260> we<00:00:49.320> start

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.959 

losing<00:01:00.859> basically<00:01:01.859> because<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.789> the

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
losing basically because of the

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.000 
losing basically because of the
condition<00:01:03.390> here<00:01:03.600> we're<00:01:03.780> worried<00:01:04.110> about<00:01:04.320> I'm

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
condition here we're worried about I'm

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.289 
condition here we're worried about I'm
worried<00:01:05.400> about<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:07.409> clay<00:01:07.740> heaving<00:01:08.640> so<00:01:09.180> we

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
worried about the clay heaving so we

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.880 
worried about the clay heaving so we
want<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.600> go<00:01:09.659> down<00:01:09.869> a<00:01:09.900> little<00:01:10.229> bit<00:01:10.409> into<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
want to go down a little bit into the

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.840 
want to go down a little bit into the
ground<00:01:11.210> prevent<00:01:12.320> frost<00:01:13.320> heave<00:01:13.700> ideally<00:01:14.700> we

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
ground prevent frost heave ideally we

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.789 
ground prevent frost heave ideally we
should<00:01:14.880> be<00:01:15.090> going<00:01:15.240> down<00:01:15.360> 18<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.960> 20<00:01:16.290> inches<00:01:16.320> in

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
should be going down 18 to 20 inches in

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.770 
should be going down 18 to 20 inches in
this<00:01:16.890> region<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.460> country<00:01:17.880> but<00:01:18.119> oh

that tire wall there so if what the

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.899 
that tire wall there so if what the
framing<00:01:58.829> will<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.100> compensate<00:01:59.579> for<00:01:59.729> what<00:01:59.880> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
framing will just compensate for what a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.969 
framing will just compensate for what a
minute<00:02:00.270> or<00:02:00.390> this<00:02:00.600> back<00:02:00.840> wall<00:02:01.079> once<00:02:01.409> we<00:02:01.619> kind<00:02:01.799> of

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
minute or this back wall once we kind of

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.459 
minute or this back wall once we kind of
established<00:02:02.219> where<00:02:02.909> our<00:02:03.509> top<00:02:03.780> plates<00:02:04.140> gonna

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
established where our top plates gonna

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.950 
established where our top plates gonna
be<00:02:04.619> will<00:02:05.159> adjust<00:02:05.790> this<00:02:06.060> back<00:02:06.329> wall<00:02:06.630> to

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
be will adjust this back wall to

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.460 
be will adjust this back wall to
accommodate<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.629> okay<00:02:09.629> okay<00:02:10.140> what<00:02:10.349> we're

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
gonna try to do is get six to eight

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.949 
gonna try to do is get six to eight

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.270 
inches
below<00:02:13.650> here<00:02:14.540> it's<00:02:15.540> you<00:02:16.530> know<00:02:16.709> and<00:02:16.980> then<00:02:17.069> we<00:02:17.250> can

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
below here it's you know and then we can

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.550 
below here it's you know and then we can
start<00:02:17.700> there<00:02:17.970> and<00:02:18.120> just<00:02:18.239> kind<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.480> eyeball<00:02:18.750> and

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
start there and just kind of eyeball and

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.170 
start there and just kind of eyeball and
then<00:02:19.829> we'll<00:02:20.010> just<00:02:20.159> kind<00:02:20.340> of<00:02:20.489> meet<00:02:21.000> in<00:02:21.090> the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
then we'll just kind of meet in the

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.149 
then we'll just kind of meet in the
middle<00:02:21.480> like<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.959> Chunnel<00:02:22.260> and<00:02:22.650> France<00:02:22.980> and

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:23.159 
middle like the Chunnel and France and

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:41.929 
middle like the Chunnel and France and
England<00:02:37.939> dug<00:02:38.939> a<00:02:39.030> trench<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:40.250> put<00:02:41.250> our<00:02:41.430> front

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:41.939 
England dug a trench to put our front

England dug a trench to put our front
greenhouse<00:02:42.480> tires<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.500> will<00:02:43.950> probably<00:02:44.280> go<00:02:44.340> to

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
greenhouse tires in will probably go to

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.089 
greenhouse tires in will probably go to

back<00:05:37.740> of<00:05:37.770> this<00:05:37.919> plastic<00:05:38.190> just<00:05:38.580> like<00:05:38.760> this<00:05:39.000> we

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
back of this plastic just like this we

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.130 
back of this plastic just like this we
pour<00:05:40.229> our<00:05:40.320> concrete<00:05:40.350> it'll<00:05:41.070> form<00:05:41.340> against

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
pour our concrete it'll form against

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:46.850 
pour our concrete it'll form against
form<00:05:43.140> against<00:05:43.350> our<00:05:43.470> gravel<00:05:44.070> backfill<00:05:45.680> so<00:05:46.680> Brad

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
form against our gravel backfill so Brad

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.380 
form against our gravel backfill so Brad
what's<00:05:47.070> your<00:05:47.190> ratio<00:05:47.550> for<00:05:47.850> the<00:05:48.590> for<00:05:49.590> the<00:05:50.390> cement

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
what's your ratio for the for the cement

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.040 
what's your ratio for the for the cement
blocks<00:05:51.630> in<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:51.930> tire<00:05:52.140> wall

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050 
blocks in the tire wall

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:02.200 
blocks in the tire wall
so<00:05:54.650> we<00:05:54.800> got<00:05:55.540> 15<00:05:56.950> 2<00:05:57.950> 3<00:05:58.250> 15<00:05:58.910> sand<00:05:59.270> three<00:05:59.810> cement<00:06:01.210> 15

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
so we got 15 2 3 15 sand three cement 15
