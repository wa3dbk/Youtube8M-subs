first development log video for Sparky

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.230 
first development log video for Sparky
Sparky<00:00:10.620> is<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> new<00:00:11.400> blender<00:00:11.790> game<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.179> I'm

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
Sparky is a new blender game that I'm

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.379 
Sparky is a new blender game that I'm
making<00:00:12.540> it's<00:00:13.320> under<00:00:13.469> production<00:00:14.179> I'm<00:00:15.179> not

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
making it's under production I'm not

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:16.760 
making it's under production I'm not
going<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.570> stop<00:00:15.780> working<00:00:16.049> on<00:00:16.289> soldier<00:00:16.650> off

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
going to stop working on soldier off

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.359 
going to stop working on soldier off
this<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.220> a<00:00:17.430> completely<00:00:17.789> separate<00:00:18.420> project

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
this is a completely separate project

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.220 
this is a completely separate project
you<00:00:20.369> know<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.670> blender<00:00:21.150> well<00:00:21.900> you<00:00:21.990> might<00:00:22.109> know

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
you know the blender well you might know

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.080 
you know the blender well you might know
the<00:00:22.410> blender<00:00:22.680> game<00:00:22.890> competition<00:00:23.820> somewhere

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
the blender game competition somewhere

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.880 
the blender game competition somewhere
game<00:00:24.210> competitions<00:00:24.480> coming<00:00:24.869> up<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.680> was

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
game competitions coming up so I was

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.640 
game competitions coming up so I was
hoping<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.430> would<00:00:26.490> be<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> good<00:00:27.689> entry

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
hoping that this would be a good entry

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.820 
hoping that this would be a good entry
something<00:00:28.980> new<00:00:29.130> so<00:00:30.109> this<00:00:31.109> is<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.380> game<00:00:31.679> where

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
something new so this is a game where

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.049 
something new so this is a game where
you<00:00:31.949> control<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:32.279> dog<00:00:32.520> who<00:00:32.820> have<00:00:32.940> been

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
you control a dog who have been

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.389 
you control a dog who have been
radioactively<00:00:33.719> modified<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.680> who<00:00:35.070> must

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
radioactively modified and who must

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.650 
radioactively modified and who must
fight<00:00:35.880> an<00:00:36.120> incoming<00:00:36.840> alien<00:00:37.380> invasion

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
fight an incoming alien invasion

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.640 
fight an incoming alien invasion
yeah<00:00:40.380> so<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:42.239> plot<00:00:42.480> is<00:00:42.660> out<00:00:42.840> there<00:00:43.050> admittedly

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:43.650 
yeah so the plot is out there admittedly

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:46.970 
yeah so the plot is out there admittedly
but<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.820> game<00:00:45.120> might<00:00:45.480> just<00:00:45.750> be<00:00:45.900> awesome<00:00:46.140> I'm

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
but the game might just be awesome I'm

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.860 
but the game might just be awesome I'm
not<00:00:47.190> sure<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.910> need<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.600> make<00:00:48.690> it

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
not sure that you need to make it

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.080 
not sure that you need to make it
offices<00:00:49.020> i'm<00:00:50.010> going<00:00:50.370> to<00:00:50.430> try<00:00:50.580> i'm<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.030> to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
offices i'm going to try i'm going to

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.920 
offices i'm going to try i'm going to
try<00:00:51.150> to<00:00:51.210> make<00:00:51.420> this<00:00:51.510> awesome<00:00:51.690> okay<00:00:52.650> so<00:00:53.930> you

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
try to make this awesome okay so you

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.640 
try to make this awesome okay so you
control<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.320> dog<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:57.000> a<00:00:57.120> dog<00:00:57.360> and<00:00:57.660> he

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
control this dog now it's a dog and he

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.950 
control this dog now it's a dog and he
can<00:00:58.800> move<00:00:58.949> left<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.400> right<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.300> you<00:01:00.540> can<00:01:00.720> jump

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
can move left and right and you can jump

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.470 
can move left and right and you can jump
and<00:01:01.280> you<00:01:02.280> can<00:01:02.309> hold<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.850> jump<00:01:03.120> button<00:01:03.269> to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
and you can hold the jump button to

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.650 
and you can hold the jump button to
making<00:01:03.750> jump<00:01:03.960> high<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:05.060> that's<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.479> all

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:06.660 
making jump high and that's it as all

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.120 
making jump high and that's it as all
yes<00:01:07.070> except<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.490> he<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:09.000> not<00:01:09.180> radioactive

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
yes except that he is not radioactive

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.740 
yes except that he is not radioactive
yeah<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.610> press<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> ionized<00:01:12.450> button

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
yeah if you press the ionized button

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.900 
yeah if you press the ionized button
which<00:01:13.050> is<00:01:13.080> square<00:01:13.380> on<00:01:13.619> my<00:01:13.790> controller<00:01:14.790> that

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
which is square on my controller that

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.279 
which is square on my controller that
I'm<00:01:15.030> controlling<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.630> or<00:01:15.810> X<00:01:16.229> no<00:01:16.950> see<00:01:17.399> on<00:01:18.289> the

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
I'm controlling with or X no see on the

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.090 
I'm controlling with or X no see on the
keyboard<00:01:19.800> you<00:01:20.550> can<00:01:20.630> ionize<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:22.110> use<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
keyboard you can ionize we use the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.749 
keyboard you can ionize we use the
keyboard<00:01:23.430> or<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.759> gamepad<00:01:24.950> but<00:01:25.950> when<00:01:26.640> he's

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
keyboard or the gamepad but when he's

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.609 
keyboard or the gamepad but when he's
ionized<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.330> can<00:01:27.479> jump<00:01:27.720> higher<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.259> can<00:01:28.440> move

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
ionized you can jump higher you can move

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.499 
ionized you can jump higher you can move
faster<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.430> wall<00:01:29.729> run<00:01:29.940> you<00:01:30.119> can<00:01:30.240> attack

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
faster you can wall run you can attack

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.080 
faster you can wall run you can attack
these<00:01:31.050> a<00:01:31.110> lot<00:01:31.500> more<00:01:31.770> mobile<00:01:32.220> when<00:01:32.789> he's

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
these a lot more mobile when he's

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.260 
these a lot more mobile when he's
ionized<00:01:33.680> now<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.740> idea<00:01:35.130> behind<00:01:35.550> this<00:01:35.789> is<00:01:36.030> that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
ionized now the idea behind this is that

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.120 
ionized now the idea behind this is that
you<00:01:36.539> basically<00:01:36.690> won't<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.530> able<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.710> do<00:01:38.009> this

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
you basically won't be able to do this

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.680 
you basically won't be able to do this
forever<00:01:38.340> but<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.820> more<00:01:39.000> thing<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.300> break<00:01:39.479> into

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
forever but the more thing to break into

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.770 
forever but the more thing to break into
or<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.200> more<00:01:40.410> enemies<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:41.039> hit<00:01:41.300> you'll<00:01:42.300> build

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
or the more enemies we hit you'll build

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.120 
or the more enemies we hit you'll build
up<00:01:42.930> more<00:01:43.140> ionization<00:01:44.119> gotcha<00:01:45.119> now<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.979> idea

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
up more ionization gotcha now the idea

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.380 
up more ionization gotcha now the idea
here<00:01:47.369> I<00:01:47.759> think<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.660> already<00:01:48.810> said<00:01:49.080> that<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:50.390> for

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
here I think I already said that but for

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.419 
here I think I already said that but for
example<00:01:51.690> let<00:01:51.780> me<00:01:51.840> give<00:01:51.959> you<00:01:52.110> example<00:01:52.500> this<00:01:53.250> is

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:53.429 
example let me give you example this is

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.969 
example let me give you example this is
his<00:01:53.520> jump<00:01:53.819> height<00:01:54.000> right<00:01:54.149> right<00:01:54.569> now<00:01:54.740> not<00:01:55.740> very

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
his jump height right right now not very

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:56.750 
his jump height right right now not very
high

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
high

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.640 
high
even<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.480> you<00:01:57.570> hold<00:01:57.810> it<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.080> give<00:01:58.230> him<00:01:58.350> a<00:01:58.440> loom

00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:58.650 
even if you hold it to give him a loom

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.530 
even if you hold it to give him a loom
extra<00:01:59.190> height<00:01:59.280> he<00:01:59.520> still<00:01:59.760> doesn't<00:02:00.000> jump<00:02:00.360> very

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
extra height he still doesn't jump very

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.960 
extra height he still doesn't jump very
high<00:02:00.660> while<00:02:01.500> he's<00:02:01.590> on<00:02:01.620> eyes<00:02:02.010> and<00:02:02.370> he<00:02:02.700> sees

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
high while he's on eyes and he sees

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.480 
high while he's on eyes and he sees
ionized<00:02:03.540> by<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.840> blue<00:02:04.020> glow<00:02:04.260> blue<00:02:05.070> trail<00:02:05.460> I

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
ionized by that blue glow blue trail I

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.520 
ionized by that blue glow blue trail I
guess<00:02:05.730> you<00:02:05.850> thought<00:02:06.090> he<00:02:06.750> jumped<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.080> lot<00:02:07.260> higher

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
guess you thought he jumped a lot higher

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.240 
guess you thought he jumped a lot higher
a<00:02:07.890> lot<00:02:08.520> higher<00:02:08.700> in<00:02:08.850> fat

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
a lot higher in fat

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.970 
a lot higher in fat
right<00:02:10.880> we<00:02:11.630> need<00:02:11.750> ionized<00:02:12.170> he<00:02:12.320> can<00:02:12.440> run<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.620> lot

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
right we need ionized he can run a lot

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.590 
right we need ionized he can run a lot
faster

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.480 

and<00:02:15.840> we<00:02:16.320> zion<00:02:16.560> i<00:02:16.680> see<00:02:16.740> can<00:02:16.950> run<00:02:17.160> up<00:02:17.250> walls

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.540 

yeah<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:22.500> wings<00:02:22.680> ionized<00:02:22.980> you<00:02:23.100> can<00:02:23.220> even<00:02:23.310> run

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
yeah and wings ionized you can even run

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.620 
yeah and wings ionized you can even run
on<00:02:23.730> ceilings<00:02:25.970> right<00:02:26.970> now<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.480> probably

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
on ceilings right now you probably

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.570 
on ceilings right now you probably
notice<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.320> kind<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.650> want<00:02:28.860> camera<00:02:29.370> this

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
notice that I kind of want camera this

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.520 
notice that I kind of want camera this
is<00:02:29.730> a<00:02:29.760> lot<00:02:30.330> more<00:02:30.360> zoomed<00:02:30.780> in<00:02:30.930> then<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.230> will<00:02:31.380> be

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
is a lot more zoomed in then it will be

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.800 
is a lot more zoomed in then it will be
in<00:02:31.620> game<00:02:31.830> I<00:02:32.180> zoomed<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.360> so<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.510> can<00:02:33.630> get<00:02:33.780> a

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
in game I zoomed in so I can get a

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.310 
in game I zoomed in so I can get a
pretty<00:02:34.050> much<00:02:34.260> 60<00:02:35.330> FPS<00:02:36.330> video<00:02:36.540> so<00:02:36.930> i<00:02:36.960> can<00:02:36.990> get<00:02:37.200> it

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
pretty much 60 FPS video so i can get it

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.500 
pretty much 60 FPS video so i can get it
nice<00:02:37.560> crispy<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.340> smooth<00:02:38.940> video<00:02:39.090> for<00:02:39.390> this

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
nice crispy and smooth video for this

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.840 
nice crispy and smooth video for this
but<00:02:40.410> yeah<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.800> you<00:02:40.860> can<00:02:41.100> see<00:02:41.220> that<00:02:41.250> it's<00:02:41.520> in

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
but yeah so you can see that it's in

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.080 
but yeah so you can see that it's in
this<00:02:42.240> game<00:02:42.540> is<00:02:42.630> going<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:42.780> be<00:02:42.840> a<00:02:42.900> lot<00:02:43.230> about

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
this game is going to be a lot about

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.780 
this game is going to be a lot about
momentum<00:02:45.090> speed<00:02:45.840> you<00:02:46.650> know<00:02:46.740> catching<00:02:47.310> things

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
momentum speed you know catching things

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.270 
momentum speed you know catching things
catching<00:02:48.420> combos<00:02:48.870> kind<00:02:49.170> of<00:02:49.230> so<00:02:49.380> to<00:02:49.440> speak<00:02:49.650> you

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
catching combos kind of so to speak you

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.190 
catching combos kind of so to speak you
know<00:02:50.370> maintaining<00:02:50.670> your<00:02:51.090> momentum<00:02:51.900> as<00:02:52.050> you

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
know maintaining your momentum as you

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.050 
know maintaining your momentum as you
head<00:02:52.500> from<00:02:52.800> platform<00:02:53.400> platform<00:02:53.610> it's<00:02:53.970> not

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
head from platform platform it's not

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.160 
head from platform platform it's not
really<00:02:54.180> that<00:02:54.390> difficult<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:57.390> control<00:02:57.900> is

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
really that difficult to to control is

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.360 
really that difficult to to control is
pretty<00:02:58.620> simple<00:02:59.750> it's<00:03:00.750> pretty<00:03:01.440> fun<00:03:01.680> i<00:03:01.710> have

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
pretty simple it's pretty fun i have

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.240 
pretty simple it's pretty fun i have
been<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> lot<00:03:03.000> of<00:03:03.030> time<00:03:03.330> like<00:03:04.260> yesterday<00:03:04.440> and

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
been a lot of time like yesterday and

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.820 
been a lot of time like yesterday and
today<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.550> little<00:03:05.970> bit<00:03:06.120> getting<00:03:06.870> the<00:03:07.080> speed<00:03:07.290> the

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
today a little bit getting the speed the

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.500 
today a little bit getting the speed the
movement<00:03:08.400> to<00:03:08.430> be<00:03:08.580> just<00:03:08.910> right<00:03:09.120> and<00:03:09.360> i<00:03:09.480> think

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
movement to be just right and i think

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.450 
movement to be just right and i think
i've<00:03:09.750> got<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.350> be<00:03:10.500> pretty<00:03:10.830> fun<00:03:11.130> right<00:03:11.160> now

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
i've got it to be pretty fun right now

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.900 
i've got it to be pretty fun right now
now<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.480> idea<00:03:13.100> there's<00:03:14.100> a<00:03:14.160> little<00:03:14.280> couple<00:03:14.850> of

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
now the idea there's a little couple of

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.730 
now the idea there's a little couple of
extra<00:03:15.450> things<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.810> little<00:03:16.080> air<00:03:16.200> hang<00:03:16.440> where

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:16.740 
extra things that little air hang where

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:18.320 
extra things that little air hang where
you<00:03:16.830> hold<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.220> the<00:03:17.550> jump<00:03:17.820> button<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.180> jump

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
you hold it the jump button to jump

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.450 
you hold it the jump button to jump
higher<00:03:18.540> if<00:03:18.780> you<00:03:19.470> come<00:03:19.740> off<00:03:19.920> of<00:03:20.160> a<00:03:20.190> platform

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
higher if you come off of a platform

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.580 
higher if you come off of a platform
when<00:03:21.150> you're<00:03:21.300> speeding<00:03:22.020> you<00:03:22.110> get<00:03:22.290> that<00:03:22.410> little

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
when you're speeding you get that little

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.290 
when you're speeding you get that little
boost<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.100> can<00:03:23.250> see<00:03:23.400> right<00:03:23.430> there<00:03:23.760> if<00:03:23.910> you

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
boost you can see right there if you

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.300 
boost you can see right there if you
hold<00:03:24.480> the<00:03:24.690> jump<00:03:25.140> button<00:03:25.230> after<00:03:25.440> you<00:03:25.860> jump<00:03:26.130> off

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
hold the jump button after you jump off

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.540 
hold the jump button after you jump off
you<00:03:26.580> get<00:03:26.790> that<00:03:27.330> boost<00:03:27.720> which<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:28.230> like<00:03:28.470> a<00:03:28.770> lot

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:29.550 
you get that boost which is like a lot

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.940 
you get that boost which is like a lot
more<00:03:29.760> not<00:03:30.150> like<00:03:30.450> not<00:03:30.930> like<00:03:30.990> a<00:03:31.230> lot<00:03:31.470> more<00:03:31.650> it<00:03:31.800> is

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:31.950 
more not like not like a lot more it is

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.990 
more not like not like a lot more it is
a<00:03:31.980> lot<00:03:32.310> more

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
a lot more

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.820 
a lot more
and<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:33.690> that<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.110> an<00:03:34.260> interesting<00:03:34.470> little

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
and so that is an interesting little

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.280 
and so that is an interesting little
technique<00:03:35.750> there's<00:03:36.750> going<00:03:36.900> to<00:03:36.960> be<00:03:36.990> a<00:03:37.050> lot

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
technique there's going to be a lot

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.110 
technique there's going to be a lot
hopefully<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.830> lot<00:03:38.010> of<00:03:38.130> techniques<00:03:38.760> like<00:03:38.880> that

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
hopefully a lot of techniques like that

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.390 
hopefully a lot of techniques like that
little<00:03:39.360> back<00:03:40.350> jumps<00:03:40.800> and<00:03:40.980> things<00:03:41.220> like<00:03:41.340> that

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
little back jumps and things like that

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.300 
little back jumps and things like that
too<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:42.150> help<00:03:42.270> you<00:03:42.680> traverse<00:03:43.680> different<00:03:44.070> the

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
too to help you traverse different the

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.840 
too to help you traverse different the
area<00:03:44.970> smoothly<00:03:47.090> so<00:03:48.090> yeah<00:03:49.100> this<00:03:50.100> is<00:03:50.310> different

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
area smoothly so yeah this is different

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:52.310 
area smoothly so yeah this is different
from<00:03:51.090> jumping<00:03:51.420> off<00:03:51.570> the<00:03:51.750> walls<00:03:51.780> will<00:03:52.200> give

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
from jumping off the walls will give

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.230 
from jumping off the walls will give
disc<00:03:52.680> difference<00:03:53.670> as<00:03:54.000> you<00:03:54.120> can<00:03:54.240> see<00:03:54.390> right

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:56.240 
disc difference as you can see right

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.360 
disc difference as you can see right
that's<00:03:57.240> a<00:03:57.420> new<00:03:58.200> to<00:03:58.620> Walter<00:03:58.950> it's<00:03:59.190> a<00:03:59.250> lot

00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.370 
that's a new to Walter it's a lot

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:01.670 
that's a new to Walter it's a lot
different<00:03:59.840> notice<00:04:00.840> that<00:04:01.080> if<00:04:01.170> I'm<00:04:01.290> writing

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
different notice that if I'm writing

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.220 
different notice that if I'm writing
down<00:04:01.830> words<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:02.520> I<00:04:02.550> jump<00:04:02.820> I<00:04:02.940> basically<00:04:03.420> saw

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
down words and I jump I basically saw

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.530 
down words and I jump I basically saw
that<00:04:04.350> angle<00:04:04.770> left<00:04:05.190> by<00:04:05.340> my<00:04:05.459> trail<00:04:05.700> at<00:04:05.850> angle<00:04:06.270> so

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
that angle left by my trail at angle so

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.380 
that angle left by my trail at angle so
it's<00:04:06.780> a<00:04:06.840> sharp<00:04:07.140> angle<00:04:07.320> going<00:04:07.650> toward<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:07.920> down

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
it's a sharp angle going toward it down

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.630 
it's a sharp angle going toward it down
going<00:04:09.390> going<00:04:10.290> toward<00:04:10.739> the<00:04:10.800> down<00:04:11.070> going<00:04:11.400> toward

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
going going toward the down going toward

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.290 
going going toward the down going toward
the<00:04:11.760> ground<00:04:12.739> whereas<00:04:13.739> if<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.250> jump<00:04:14.580> pretty

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
the ground whereas if you jump pretty

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.840 
the ground whereas if you jump pretty
much<00:04:15.420> restrict<00:04:15.870> still<00:04:16.169> you'll<00:04:16.620> have<00:04:17.340> a<00:04:17.370> little

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
much restrict still you'll have a little

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.050 
much restrict still you'll have a little
better<00:04:18.060> angle<00:04:18.650> if<00:04:19.650> you<00:04:19.769> jump<00:04:20.010> going<00:04:20.220> up<00:04:20.430> you

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
better angle if you jump going up you

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.670 
better angle if you jump going up you
have<00:04:21.239> a<00:04:21.269> lot<00:04:21.480> better<00:04:21.690> England<00:04:22.109> outlook<00:04:22.500> and

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
have a lot better England outlook and

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.370 
have a lot better England outlook and
you<00:04:22.830> go<00:04:23.040> to<00:04:23.100> combine<00:04:23.730> that<00:04:23.910> with<00:04:23.970> the<00:04:24.169> air<00:04:25.169> hang

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
you go to combine that with the air hang

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.220 
you go to combine that with the air hang
to<00:04:25.500> get<00:04:25.620> a<00:04:25.650> really<00:04:26.070> hard<00:04:26.340> job<00:04:26.430> so<00:04:27.300> it<00:04:27.600> I<00:04:27.870> guess

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
to get a really hard job so it I guess

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.630 
to get a really hard job so it I guess
it's<00:04:28.410> kind<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:28.680> like<00:04:28.770> in<00:04:28.919> place<00:04:29.250> like<00:04:29.490> it

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:29.640 
it's kind of like in place like it

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.770 
it's kind of like in place like it
matters<00:04:29.910> which<00:04:30.180> direction<00:04:30.510> you're<00:04:30.750> running

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
matters which direction you're running

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.390 
matters which direction you're running
in

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
in

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.830 
in
jump<00:04:32.790> off<00:04:32.910> so<00:04:33.720> it's<00:04:33.900> it<00:04:34.770> really<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:35.419> lot<00:04:36.419> of<00:04:36.540> room

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
jump off so it's it really a lot of room

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.550 
jump off so it's it really a lot of room
for<00:04:37.580> true<00:04:38.580> just<00:04:38.910> having<00:04:39.810> fun<00:04:39.840> of<00:04:40.169> movement

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
for true just having fun of movement

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.260 
for true just having fun of movement
just<00:04:40.830> messing<00:04:41.400> around<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:41.880> know<00:04:41.940> trying<00:04:42.210> to

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
just messing around you know trying to

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.820 
just messing around you know trying to
get<00:04:42.389> different<00:04:42.600> jumps<00:04:42.990> going<00:04:43.680> different

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
get different jumps going different

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:46.850 
get different jumps going different
places<00:04:44.060> okay<00:04:45.060> now<00:04:45.479> that's<00:04:45.870> not<00:04:45.990> it<00:04:46.199> I<00:04:46.440> am<00:04:46.740> in

spinning die move you can't really see

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.909 
spinning die move you can't really see
it<00:04:59.490> very<00:04:59.669> well<00:04:59.820> on<00:05:00.090> this<00:05:00.380> camera<00:05:01.380> because<00:05:01.710> so

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 
it very well on this camera because so

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.279 
it very well on this camera because so
zoomed<00:05:02.130> in<00:05:02.280> but<00:05:02.820> you'll<00:05:02.940> basically<00:05:03.090> do<00:05:03.509> why

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
zoomed in but you'll basically do why

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.680 
zoomed in but you'll basically do why
can't<00:05:04.500> the<00:05:04.710> Canadian<00:05:05.070> boy<00:05:05.210> there's<00:05:06.210> one<00:05:06.570> of

can't the Canadian boy there's one of

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.689 
can't the Canadian boy there's one of
these<00:05:06.870> bugs<00:05:07.710> there's<00:05:07.949> only<00:05:08.039> a<00:05:08.160> few<00:05:08.310> bucks<00:05:08.520> i

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
these bugs there's only a few bucks i

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.129 
these bugs there's only a few bucks i
haven't<00:05:08.970> squashing<00:05:09.539> that<00:05:09.720> where<00:05:09.870> is<00:05:09.960> there

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:10.139 
haven't squashing that where is there

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.670 
haven't squashing that where is there
not<00:05:10.740> sure<00:05:10.919> exactly<00:05:11.280> what's<00:05:11.490> making<00:05:11.850> it<00:05:11.880> happen

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
not sure exactly what's making it happen

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.920 
not sure exactly what's making it happen
but<00:05:13.680> yeah<00:05:14.070> I<00:05:14.340> need<00:05:14.669> to<00:05:14.760> fix<00:05:14.910> them<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.330> definitely

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
but yeah I need to fix them I definitely

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:17.340 
but yeah I need to fix them I definitely
need<00:05:16.199> to<00:05:16.289> confide<00:05:16.590> fine

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
need to confide fine

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:22.110 
need to confide fine
oh<00:05:17.460> I<00:05:18.460> might<00:05:18.820> know<00:05:19.120> exactly<00:05:19.510> ok<00:05:20.110> so<00:05:20.710> anyway<00:05:21.120> if

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
oh I might know exactly ok so anyway if

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.910 
oh I might know exactly ok so anyway if
you<00:05:22.240> press<00:05:22.420> down<00:05:22.450> an<00:05:22.810> attack<00:05:23.080> you'll<00:05:23.560> do<00:05:23.710> that

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:23.920 
you press down an attack you'll do that

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.440 
you press down an attack you'll do that
downward<00:05:24.400> spin<00:05:24.700> attack<00:05:25.530> like<00:05:26.530> that<00:05:26.580> now<00:05:27.580> you

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:28.450 
downward spin attack like that now you

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.090 
downward spin attack like that now you
build<00:05:28.660> a<00:05:28.750> smash<00:05:29.110> through<00:05:29.410> enemies<00:05:29.710> hit

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
build a smash through enemies hit

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.340 
build a smash through enemies hit
objects<00:05:30.880> break<00:05:31.150> things<00:05:31.360> with<00:05:31.750> that<00:05:31.780> rule<00:05:32.170> so

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
objects break things with that rule so

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.230 
objects break things with that rule so
it's<00:05:32.470> going<00:05:32.590> to<00:05:32.650> be<00:05:32.710> very<00:05:33.520> useful<00:05:33.640> and<00:05:34.030> there

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
it's going to be very useful and there

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:35.760 
it's going to be very useful and there
will<00:05:34.330> be<00:05:34.360> other<00:05:34.570> moves<00:05:34.840> probably<00:05:35.500> one<00:05:35.620> for

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:35.770 
will be other moves probably one for

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:38.370 
will be other moves probably one for
each<00:05:35.890> direction<00:05:36.100> end<00:05:36.490> and<00:05:36.990> won't<00:05:37.990> one<00:05:38.230> for

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
each direction end and won't one for

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.280 
each direction end and won't one for
each<00:05:38.470> direction<00:05:38.620> up<00:05:38.950> down<00:05:39.130> left<00:05:39.190> and<00:05:39.610> right

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:40.290 
each direction up down left and right

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:42.840 
each direction up down left and right
and<00:05:41.290> so<00:05:41.500> the<00:05:41.620> idea<00:05:41.650> of<00:05:42.040> the<00:05:42.100> game<00:05:42.250> is<00:05:42.310> basically

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:42.850 
and so the idea of the game is basically

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.180 
and so the idea of the game is basically
just<00:05:42.880> use<00:05:43.240> your<00:05:43.420> speed<00:05:43.780> and<00:05:44.050> momentum<00:05:44.740> to

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
just use your speed and momentum to

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:47.370 
just use your speed and momentum to
break<00:05:45.430> through<00:05:45.670> thing<00:05:45.940> to<00:05:45.970> to<00:05:46.750> smash<00:05:47.110> things

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
break through thing to to smash things

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:50.250 
break through thing to to smash things
to<00:05:47.590> just<00:05:47.950> keep<00:05:48.490> yourself<00:05:49.330> going<00:05:49.390> and<00:05:49.900> keep

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
to just keep yourself going and keep

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:52.650 
to just keep yourself going and keep
your<00:05:50.410> full<00:05:50.590> squad<00:05:50.830> up<00:05:51.010> while<00:05:51.190> you're<00:05:51.660> breaking

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
your full squad up while you're breaking
