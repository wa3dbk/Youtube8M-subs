 my 2015 we are looking up now 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.330
 many of your wishes desired the whole 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.009
 menu of the new game you there everything 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.690
 completely revised 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.699
 It has to be done quickly 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.590
 easy race there we come as 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.180
 first time here in this menu there can 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.779
 we choose a route these are the ones 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.400
 whole here now from the race calendar 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.199
 2015 next we can enter 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.189
 Select team because we have below then 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.969
 again and again a few information 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.860
 he already knows that and if so 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.050
 We can then click on it 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.550
 then one of the two drivers 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.809
 with such a nice animations 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.120
 being represented 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.379
 then I have session options 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.120
 there we can pay once 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.649
 want to have training with the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.739
 selection options you see 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:53.190
 qualifying is the race distance as well 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.530
 as usual three 25 50 and 100 percent 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.660
 then the weather is still a little something 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.449
 come to it causes there are 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.489
 also and stormy 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.110
 that has to look at everything else 16 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.900
 Watch the livestream at the weser not 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.549
 then knew the difficulty there 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.159
 There are also many possibilities 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.600
 this year expert legend sweet again 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.880
 where we will move 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.840
 flashback parc fermÃ© rules and the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.700
 car damage 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.380
 and there I can tell you puts it 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.229
 quiet on complete one still notices 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.090
 hardly any driving aids is for which reason 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.380
 always instructed the brake assistant 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.000
 I was already surprised on the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.500
 In any case, you can go first round 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.990
 here again a lot if again 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.689
 traction control ideal line the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.689
 of course also automatically or 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.759
 manually or manually with help and the 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.570
 boxing assistant guides you through 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.270
 the whole pit lane long accompanies so 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.259
 so much for a quick start and what you have there 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.119
 can choose everything 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:53.670
 after fast was already once to 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.979
 next point the multiplayer has 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.340
 a lot was done this time, too 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.710
 Here are some kind of scenario modes 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.680
 we know from f1 2014 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.580
 I think so I think they have something 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.270
 similar to this scenario mode 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:13.220
 which was still in the last games 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.200
 there is something for beginners standard 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.980
 there are always which then 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.460
 hardcore without any driving aids zb 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.290
 here 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.300
 and then there's something new and two 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.540
 tv edges we could now be the last one 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.240
 formula 1 race after driving so that 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.350
 from the real life of silverstone the 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.050
 We can race for goods and 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:35.120
 Of course, custom races with 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.070
 which we actually just online 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.750
 can drive with our friends 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.010
 on the track we want with the 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.770
 weather that we want and the 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.040
 race distance we want so here 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.920
 a kind of scenario mode and you can 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.510
 the drive to drive and of course 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.550
 custom race and time trial 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.170
 Of course, there is again it 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.730
 click come the first time again 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:59.120
 stretch that we can choose 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:01.100
 then the teams but only the teams 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.750
 driver then can not ourselves if 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.880
 we can again look at driving aids 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.640
 we already had the opponent spirit 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.130
 and show my spirit and weather 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:13.010
 we can come back here again 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:16.010
 possible choice then we come to 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.360
 my f1 eat almost only the attitude 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.489
 which one can do here 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.500
 and it seems so too 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:24.260
 For example , we can control ourselves 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.570
 also look at it is so far that it 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.160
 not my xbox control became the 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:30.500
 here is a reset that has to 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:32.360
 then feel the legs afterwards 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.780
 but you can do it all here 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.430
 case change and also the info so to speak 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.959
 mature harm info is need with it 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.580
 you only know how to move the button correctly 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:42.920
 not even that with the day one patch 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.330
 came out or not at the audio 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.080
 attitude we have again completely 

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:51.080
 many ways to adjust 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:52.489
 much more than before with the old ones 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.170
 you still have to share one 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:55.850
 I always saw plug-in install with it 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.580
 you can really rain everything here can 

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.470
 one does not just settle everything from 0 to 100 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.780
 in smaller steps 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.860
 then let's take a look now 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.920
 graphics settings there can also be correct 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:10.250
 Doing a lot of dieting will make you look 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:14.030
 the tallest will be full screen 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:17.350
 v sync off anti aliasing to the highest 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:21.310
 and 16 times to this tropical filtering 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:22.960
 yes always confirm and will be 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.620
 We can change benchmark tests here 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.730
 also still do it and still so 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.700
 advanced settings we 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:33.280
 can choose and advanced smoke 

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.890
 shadow and mix of tire marks 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.320
 where intel behind it I could me 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:39.880
 Imagine it just with intel graphics 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.620
 So maybe the onboard graphic and 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.960
 I am now working but unsure 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.940
 I'm always just the artwork about one 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.530
 graphics card and you can just here 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:50.050
 benchmark test either loop 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.180
 perform or a single one then 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.440
 Here we can switch to the season 2014 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.570
 you can do that at the very beginning of the 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:59.140
 play while you start automatically 

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.520
 save set new profile quasi 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.230
 and of course that 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.430
 set nationality that I have in 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:03.820
 not here at all 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.370
 made 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.110
 because we can fall through correctly 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:11.320
 choose and of course introduce us as 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.060
 leaving a child play in germany 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.170
 of course we do not want that and then 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.060
 we still have the championship too 

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:18.760
 say that it is virtually the new career 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:20.890
 we an existing driver 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:23.260
 Hopefully we will drive today 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.600
 even the first video I will 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:27.010
 Immediately receives in any case comes 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.850
 as early as possible with a lot of bad luck though 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:29.650
 tomorrow 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.430
 and then there is the professional season 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.830
 where you can only see from the cockpit perspective 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:38.890
 So it goes from the fan perspective and 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:42.540
 without any one has so without overlay 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:45.550
 almost only with the information from the engineer 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.790
 that's it from my side that is 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.410
 it menu from f1 2015 i hope i could 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.270
 you like a little with 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.950
 the video all have a wonderful 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.980
 day and hopefully for most of you 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.910
 See you later at the live stream 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.910
 finished
