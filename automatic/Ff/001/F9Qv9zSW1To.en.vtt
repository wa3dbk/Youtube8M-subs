00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:16.490
 then this represents the smile ya 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:19.230
 graft that has been cut off so we 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.740
 concept the branch on the branch cut 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.810
 a very confident sleeve in the middle a 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:31.650
 about the depth of a blade of 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:37.860
 cutter very straight 103 hoe the skin of 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:40.410
 the cherry branch then oprean the 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.059
 graft taken from a tree 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:48.020
 fruit tree that already gives very beautiful 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:57.110
 cherries it is cut right leaving a 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:57.110
 two three four bogeys on the mouth 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:07.500
 then we will carve that mouth 

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:12.650
 being careful not to damage too much 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:16.880
 more the bark of the shaft of the sleeve 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.880
 here it is very well but if 

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.509
 irregular 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:32.180
 So it will take airs then 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:37.460
 with friends on the branch of the tree 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.460
 gently not defend everything 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.470
 good if not a little tip the common 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:54.810
 are they going a little dry little trick you 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:02:00.360
 go to the mouth you salivate and it 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:03.920
 do a lot like that or for that 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.920
 slide but now they have their inputs 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.470
 that's practically satire all alone jala 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:20.790
 after the raffia is not it is where you 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:28.050
 take your raffia as you turn 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:32.390
 around just below the slot and 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.390
 surround yourself with raffia when there are 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.800
 men 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:45.980
 Once I finished dressing 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:50.100
 raffia you take your dough a graft 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:53.760
 you baste everything and leave you 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:57.000
 to dry and now they have a moment the 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:01.100
 season that the bud if it took fate 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.100
 it took six hours past that took 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:07.140
 if you do not have a raffia sonapra fiat 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.590
 you have more last minute you 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:11.640
 take high shot of Scotch tape 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.410
 electrician 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.700
 and you do the same thing with this 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.010
 coach it avoids the dough 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.630
 but you have to sit tight 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.750
 hermetic and that the graft does not 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.620
 receive no air because he receives 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.989
 from the air it dries 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.989
 There it is, thanks
