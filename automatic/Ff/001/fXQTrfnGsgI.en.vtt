00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 give me the hand the sun has appeared there 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.259
 we have to take the path 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.730
 hello to all of you today 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.010
 I find you for a new kind 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.269
 of video from me because I know 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.799
 not some of you know 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.199
 maybe but these last five days 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:18.990
 I was in Bavaria in Germany 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:24.689
 and so I ate a lot of meat 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.949
 morning noon is very good but I have 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.029
 need a case now that I am 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.199
 back I need something 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.820
 much cooler especially since 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.900
 Paris is super hot I want to 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.309
 show a bit what I could buy 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.710
 in the different shops 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.620
 ie crossroads and clear life 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.000
 an organic store so I can show this 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
 I bought then we will start 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.270
 by the least interesting to you 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.399
 last the suspense in what I have 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:48.210
 bought at crossroads that's all 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:50.579
 first I buy fruit so 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.149
 bananas here already want to give me 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:56.280
 a little smoothie before you leave and 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:01:03.390
 banana bananas I love that it is 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:04.739
 also like that I have called 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.909
 never thrown in fact I always have 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.159
 eat in the canteen and it's a moment 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.229
 there we will see if it's better 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.750
 I buy tomatoes learn it 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.909
 clusters so all that is not organic 1 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.369
 of course it feels good on this level the 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.210
 life where I took a small mix of salad 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.950
 of mesclun 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.840
 because in fact I wanted her to attend 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.250
 to normal this is what I do not like 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.799
 to use too many packages like that 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.490
 and in fact there was only to accept the 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.270
 tech 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.530
 so I took this while waiting for salad 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.030
 then for the smoothies and also 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:38.640
 Paumed salting and private young shoots 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.979
 spinach that I love to sow 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.590
 snoussi again and for just about all 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.659
 ages a little fruit pure juice of course 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.360
 because impossible for me to use 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:53.909
 concentrates of joux of the nectars of 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:58.820
 you it 's used to nothing to forget in 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.550
 the spirit a little flat fishing hack 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.370
 here 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.690
 I do not know what's going on 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.790
 store like that at home anyway 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.990
 market 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.030
 then I made a reserve of fruits 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.080
 dry for a little surprise that you 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.680
 waiting very soon 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.990
 soon a sesame that can therefore 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.100
 dried apricots 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.880
 here are dried bananas 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.160
 so I make sure that there is no 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:29.260
 too many additives of kind not at all 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.320
 enrobed in grapes and my sin 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.320
 cute 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:42.550
 and finally to finish with cif or 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:45.910

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:50.650

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:54.060
 so I close at random then two 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.320
 cereal cakes and scream 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.940

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.740
 done and you're grilling at once and 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.380
 it's really good with little ones 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.250
 vegetables and it's super happy at all 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.140
