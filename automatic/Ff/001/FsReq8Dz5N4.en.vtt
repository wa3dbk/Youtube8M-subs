and<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:44.250> would<00:01:44.729> assume<00:01:45.149> that<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.479> was<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.930> that

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and I would assume that that was so that

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.539 
and I would assume that that was so that
he<00:01:46.079> could<00:01:46.320> ride<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.740> vehicles<00:01:47.130> quite<00:01:47.399> easily

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
he could ride the vehicles quite easily

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.850 
he could ride the vehicles quite easily
now<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.329> mongoose<00:01:48.990> can't<00:01:49.320> actually<00:01:49.530> have

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
now the mongoose can't actually have

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.880 
now the mongoose can't actually have
other<00:01:50.189> Spartans<00:01:51.000> on<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.470> is<00:01:52.649> a<00:01:52.680> little

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
other Spartans on it but it is a little

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.260 
other Spartans on it but it is a little
bit<00:01:53.009> easier<00:01:53.369> with<00:01:53.549> him<00:01:53.729> because<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.149> way

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
bit easier with him because of the way

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.330 
bit easier with him because of the way
his<00:01:54.420> legs<00:01:54.570> open<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.619> side<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:56.100> know<00:01:56.189> like

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
his legs open to the side you know like

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.219 
his legs open to the side you know like
he<00:01:56.460> can<00:01:56.579> ride<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.759> saddle<00:01:57.180> some<00:01:58.140> other

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
he can ride a saddle some other

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.550 
he can ride a saddle some other
noticeable<00:01:58.829> difference<00:01:59.369> is<00:01:59.869> the<00:02:00.869> biggest<00:02:01.320> one

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
noticeable difference is the biggest one

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.440 
noticeable difference is the biggest one
is<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> wrist<00:02:02.579> he<00:02:03.060> doesn't<00:02:03.329> have<00:02:03.390> a

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
is with the wrist he doesn't have a

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.090 
is with the wrist he doesn't have a
ball-joint<00:02:03.719> wrist<00:02:04.200> anymore<00:02:04.320> he<00:02:04.680> actually<00:02:04.829> has

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
ball-joint wrist anymore he actually has

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.510 
ball-joint wrist anymore he actually has
a<00:02:05.130> hinge<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:05.939> can<00:02:06.479> get<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.869> lighting<00:02:07.259> right<00:02:07.520> he

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
a hinge I can get the lighting right he

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.699 
a hinge I can get the lighting right he
actually<00:02:08.640> has<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:08.940> hinge<00:02:09.300> here<00:02:09.629> and<00:02:09.840> the<00:02:10.440> hand

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
actually has a hinge here and the hand

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.229 
actually has a hinge here and the hand
does<00:02:10.890> still<00:02:11.099> rotate<00:02:11.459> around<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:11.970> if<00:02:12.090> you've

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
does still rotate around and if you've

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.140 
does still rotate around and if you've
never<00:02:12.360> seen<00:02:12.510> a<00:02:12.750> halo

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
Spartans have a ton of articulation and

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.800 
Spartans have a ton of articulation and
they<00:02:18.010> are<00:02:18.129> really<00:02:18.489> cool<00:02:18.760> all<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.390> Spartans

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
they are really cool all the Spartans

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:21.899 
they are really cool all the Spartans
are<00:02:19.930> awesome<00:02:20.379> unless<00:02:21.280> you<00:02:21.430> get<00:02:21.579> one<00:02:21.760> that

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
are awesome unless you get one that

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.000 
are awesome unless you get one that
falls<00:02:22.030> apart<00:02:22.420> then<00:02:22.599> it's<00:02:22.750> really<00:02:23.019> sad<00:02:23.319> but

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
falls apart then it's really sad but

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.280 
falls apart then it's really sad but
anyway<00:02:24.730> all<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.540> Spartans<00:02:25.840> are<00:02:25.930> really<00:02:26.110> cool

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
anyway all the Spartans are really cool

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.289 
anyway all the Spartans are really cool
the<00:02:26.650> only<00:02:26.890> downside<00:02:27.189> to<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.760> mark<00:02:28.000> five

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
the only downside to the mark five

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:29.849 
the only downside to the mark five
because<00:02:28.720> actually<00:02:29.110> he<00:02:29.230> is<00:02:29.409> one<00:02:29.680> of<00:02:29.709> my

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:29.859 
because actually he is one of my

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.349 
because actually he is one of my
favorite<00:02:30.189> characters<00:02:30.340> now<00:02:30.700> and<00:02:30.970> I<00:02:31.180> don't

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:31.359 
favorite characters now and I don't

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:32.729 
favorite characters now and I don't
really<00:02:31.540> even<00:02:31.689> know<00:02:31.900> why<00:02:32.109> I<00:02:32.140> guess<00:02:32.500> it's<00:02:32.680> just

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
really even know why I guess it's just

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.630 
really even know why I guess it's just
because<00:02:34.379> he<00:02:35.379> just<00:02:35.650> seems<00:02:35.859> really<00:02:36.010> cool<00:02:36.280> to<00:02:36.519> me

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
because he just seems really cool to me

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.220 
because he just seems really cool to me
it's<00:02:37.030> not<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.329> orange<00:02:37.629> a<00:02:37.689> lot<00:02:37.810> of<00:02:37.900> big<00:02:37.989> orange

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
it's not the orange a lot of big orange

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.110 
it's not the orange a lot of big orange
fan<00:02:38.500> it's<00:02:38.709> just<00:02:38.859> the<00:02:38.950> way<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.189> his<00:02:39.340> helmet<00:02:40.000> is

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
fan it's just the way that his helmet is

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.970 
fan it's just the way that his helmet is
and<00:02:40.359> the<00:02:40.450> rest<00:02:40.599> of<00:02:40.750> it<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:40.989> all<00:02:41.200> really<00:02:41.799> cool

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689

like i said before you can't have other
Spartans<00:04:12.010> ride<00:04:12.549> the<00:04:12.790> mongoose<00:04:13.180> just<00:04:14.049> get<00:04:14.199> them

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
Spartans ride the mongoose just get them

positioned properly and bam now he's

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.080 
positioned properly and bam now he's
riding<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.560> mongoose<00:04:17.919> something<00:04:18.760> else<00:04:18.880> you

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
riding the mongoose something else you

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.360 
riding the mongoose something else you
can<00:04:19.120> use<00:04:19.359> on<00:04:19.510> the<00:04:19.570> Mongoose<00:04:19.900> is<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.500> the<00:04:20.799> they

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
can use on the Mongoose is that the they

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.830 
can use on the Mongoose is that the they
have<00:04:21.489> like<00:04:21.639> these<00:04:21.760> kickstands<00:04:22.270> here<00:04:22.570> for<00:04:22.779> the

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
have like these kickstands here for the

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.110 
have like these kickstands here for the
feet<00:04:23.080> on<00:04:23.289> both<00:04:23.710> sides<00:04:23.979> they<00:04:24.219> go<00:04:24.789> up<00:04:24.909> and<00:04:25.000> down

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
feet on both sides they go up and down

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.020 
feet on both sides they go up and down
and<00:04:25.479> form

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
and form

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.580 
and form
actually<00:04:26.330> so<00:04:26.870> you<00:04:26.900> can<00:04:27.139> position<00:04:27.380> them

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
actually so you can position them

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.050 
actually so you can position them
differently<00:04:27.889> so<00:04:28.010> you<00:04:28.070> can<00:04:28.190> have<00:04:28.340> your<00:04:28.670> figure

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
differently so you can have your figure

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.330 
differently so you can have your figure
on<00:04:29.270> the<00:04:29.720> vehicle<00:04:29.960> standing<00:04:30.920> in<00:04:30.980> all<00:04:31.070> kinds<00:04:31.310> of

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:31.340 
on the vehicle standing in all kinds of

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.640 
on the vehicle standing in all kinds of
different<00:04:31.400> poses<00:04:32.110> something<00:04:33.110> else<00:04:33.320> really

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 
different poses something else really

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:36.159 
different poses something else really
cool<00:04:34.010> is<00:04:34.280> that<00:04:34.340> any<00:04:35.030> elite<00:04:35.360> can<00:04:35.780> actually

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
cool is that any elite can actually

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:37.810 
cool is that any elite can actually
write<00:04:36.350> it<00:04:36.500> here<00:04:36.560> and<00:04:36.710> get<00:04:36.800> the<00:04:36.950> gun<00:04:37.550> off<00:04:37.580> his

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
write it here and get the gun off his

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.420 
write it here and get the gun off his
back<00:04:38.000> but<00:04:38.720> in<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:38.990> elite<00:04:39.230> can<00:04:39.680> ride<00:04:40.160> a

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
back but in the elite can ride a

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:42.820 
back but in the elite can ride a
mongoose<00:04:40.870> the<00:04:41.870> rest<00:04:42.080> of<00:04:42.260> the<00:04:42.350> figures<00:04:42.680> like

with a weapon which you know isn't such

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.550 
with a weapon which you know isn't such
a<00:05:43.910> big<00:05:44.090> deal<00:05:44.150> he<00:05:44.450> does<00:05:44.600> have<00:05:44.900> room<00:05:45.350> in<00:05:45.410> his

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
a big deal he does have room in his

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.430 
a big deal he does have room in his
hands<00:05:45.770> to<00:05:45.919> hold<00:05:46.070> guns<00:05:46.340> as<00:05:46.610> you<00:05:47.419> can<00:05:47.539> see<00:05:47.720> but

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 
hands to hold guns as you can see but

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:50.020 
hands to hold guns as you can see but
the<00:05:48.680> fact<00:05:48.950> that<00:05:49.070> he<00:05:49.160> can't<00:05:49.460> look<00:05:49.610> up<00:05:49.760> and<00:05:49.910> down

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:50.030 
the fact that he can't look up and down

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.040 
the fact that he can't look up and down
and<00:05:50.240> it's<00:05:50.330> really<00:05:50.539> difficult<00:05:50.690> to<00:05:50.960> look

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:51.050 
and it's really difficult to look

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:53.170 
and it's really difficult to look
sideways<00:05:51.350> with<00:05:51.680> him<00:05:51.860> is<00:05:52.100> a<00:05:52.370> problem<00:05:52.880> so<00:05:53.000> it's<00:05:53.120> a

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:53.180 
sideways with him is a problem so it's a

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.000 
sideways with him is a problem so it's a
four<00:05:53.360> out<00:05:53.450> of<00:05:53.510> five<00:05:53.660> the<00:05:53.900> mongoose<00:05:54.380> however<00:05:54.770> is

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.010 
four out of five the mongoose however is

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.890 
four out of five the mongoose however is
a<00:05:55.490> five<00:05:55.820> out<00:05:56.000> of<00:05:56.030> five<00:05:56.240> because<00:05:56.539> I<00:05:56.570> wasn't

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:56.900 
a five out of five because I wasn't

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:58.240 
a five out of five because I wasn't
really<00:05:56.990> expecting<00:05:57.140> it<00:05:57.530> to<00:05:57.590> be<00:05:57.620> quite<00:05:57.950> in<00:05:58.160> the

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
really expecting it to be quite in the

00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.529 
really expecting it to be quite in the
scale<00:05:58.520> and<00:05:58.789> then<00:05:58.880> I<00:05:58.910> wasn't<00:05:59.180> expecting<00:05:59.300> that

00:05:59.529 --> 00:05:59.539 
scale and then I wasn't expecting that

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:01.779 
scale and then I wasn't expecting that
moving<00:05:59.810> parts<00:06:00.229> and<00:06:00.380> for<00:06:01.280> so<00:06:01.490> many<00:06:01.550> different

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:01.789 
moving parts and for so many different

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:03.279 
moving parts and for so many different
other<00:06:01.970> figures<00:06:02.270> to<00:06:02.419> ride<00:06:02.630> and<00:06:02.810> look<00:06:02.930> cool<00:06:03.140> and

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:03.289 
other figures to ride and look cool and

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:04.990 
other figures to ride and look cool and
stuff<00:06:03.500> so<00:06:03.680> that<00:06:03.710> that<00:06:04.190> gets<00:06:04.520> a<00:06:04.669> five<00:06:04.820> out<00:06:04.970> of

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 
stuff so that that gets a five out of

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.270 
stuff so that that gets a five out of
five<00:06:05.150> so<00:06:05.360> overall<00:06:05.780> the<00:06:06.200> whole<00:06:06.410> set<00:06:06.710> does<00:06:07.039> get<00:06:07.250> a

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:07.280 
five so overall the whole set does get a

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.279 
five so overall the whole set does get a
five<00:06:07.520> out<00:06:07.669> of<00:06:07.700> five<00:06:07.820> just<00:06:08.660> because<00:06:08.900> it<00:06:09.020> is<00:06:09.110> so

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:09.289 
five out of five just because it is so

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:10.750 
five out of five just because it is so
cool<00:06:09.530> if<00:06:09.740> you<00:06:09.890> can<00:06:10.039> find<00:06:10.220> it<00:06:10.430> and<00:06:10.550> they<00:06:10.729> know

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
cool if you can find it and they know

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.469 
cool if you can find it and they know
they<00:06:11.060> have<00:06:11.090> a<00:06:11.650> cyan<00:06:13.030> Spartan<00:06:14.030> and<00:06:14.270> they<00:06:14.330> also

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
they have a cyan Spartan and they also

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.930 
they have a cyan Spartan and they also
have<00:06:14.720> a<00:06:14.750> crimson<00:06:15.729> Spartan<00:06:16.729> so<00:06:16.789> they<00:06:16.850> have

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:16.940 
have a crimson Spartan so they have

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.190 
have a crimson Spartan so they have
three<00:06:17.090> different<00:06:17.240> kinds<00:06:17.419> of<00:06:17.630> mongoose<00:06:17.930> it's

three different kinds of mongoose it's
the<00:06:18.289> same<00:06:18.440> mongoose<00:06:18.800> but<00:06:18.890> it<00:06:18.950> comes<00:06:19.100> three

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
the same mongoose but it comes three

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.490 
the same mongoose but it comes three
different<00:06:19.520> kinds<00:06:19.580> of<00:06:19.760> Spartans<00:06:20.090> go<00:06:20.810> out<00:06:20.990> get

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
different kinds of Spartans go out get

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:22.990 
different kinds of Spartans go out get
it<00:06:21.650> it's<00:06:21.830> a<00:06:21.890> really<00:06:22.100> cool<00:06:22.310> figure<00:06:22.669> it'll<00:06:22.850> look

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:23.000 
it it's a really cool figure it'll look
