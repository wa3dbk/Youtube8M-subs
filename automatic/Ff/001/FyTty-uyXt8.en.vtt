00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:03.540
Since I ride a motorcycle, I've met a lot of people

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.140
guys and girls, young or old, 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.720
Arabs, Black or Chinese people,

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:15.792
and even Gipsies... 

00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:17.534
In one word, bikers! 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.520
The biker spirit, this is the connection between all of us

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.900
We don't know each other, but we wave at each other

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.680
No matter the kind of motorcycle we have

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.880
The biker spirit, this is also this universal topic we all talk about

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.380
This is being alone on the bike, but with a community in your heart

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.880
This is visiting someone you don't know from Adam, because he has the necessary tools and skills for repairing your bike

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.620
This is when you crash, and all the other bikers stop, help you to pick up your bike, and ask you if you're ok

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.500
But the biker spirit isn't only that... This is also to feel alive

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.040
This is thrilling experiences

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.600
This is coming to work with a smile because you haven't lost one hour in traffic jams

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.740
This is also this glance at the other bikers you meet at red lights...

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.220
... and your smiles at each other, no matter who was here first

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.520
For the ordinary joe, roads are just a way between two locations

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.820
For me, for you, for us, roads are the playground of our passion

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.960
Let's not forget that the biker spirit, this is also sharing the road and cultivating our image with the respect shown to the other road users.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:56.880
For me, this is the biker spirit... Whatever your past life, who you are, your job, your religion, your age, your gender, we don't care ! 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.700
Nobody will judge you, nobody will question you; We're here for having fun, for helping and listening each other, for sharing

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.380
In short, live our passion, our love for 2-wheelers

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.020
I believe that the biker spirit is just a special way for enjoying life

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.660
To Paul, CÃ©dric, and all of the ones who have left us too early

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.320
Thanks to all of you for allowing me to live this adventure

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.460
