so<00:00:02.010> what<00:00:02.730> is<00:00:02.879> this<00:00:03.120> new<00:00:03.449> four<00:00:03.899> note<00:00:04.170> chord

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
so what is this new four note chord

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.889 
so what is this new four note chord
called<00:00:05.009> in<00:00:05.220> music<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.879> how<00:00:06.390> can<00:00:06.450> we

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
called in music and how can we

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.879 
called in music and how can we
incorporate<00:00:07.259> it<00:00:07.740> into<00:00:07.919> our<00:00:08.069> studies<00:00:09.889> from

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
incorporate it into our studies from

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.249 
incorporate it into our studies from
playing<00:00:11.250> all<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.910> core<00:00:12.150> tones<00:00:12.480> together<00:00:12.960> from

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
playing all the core tones together from

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.070 
playing all the core tones together from
the<00:00:13.410> C<00:00:13.679> major<00:00:13.920> scale<00:00:14.190> or<00:00:14.549> any<00:00:15.360> major<00:00:15.630> scale<00:00:15.900> for

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
the C major scale or any major scale for

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.620 
the C major scale or any major scale for
that<00:00:16.379> matter<00:00:16.590> we've<00:00:17.310> actually<00:00:17.670> created<00:00:18.180> the

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
that matter we've actually created the

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.179 
that matter we've actually created the
type<00:00:18.869> of<00:00:19.080> chord<00:00:19.350> called<00:00:19.770> a<00:00:20.039> major<00:00:20.520> 7th<00:00:21.180> and

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
type of chord called a major 7th and

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:24.800 
type of chord called a major 7th and
because<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> previous<00:00:23.850> example<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.420> root

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
because in the previous example the root

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.019 
because in the previous example the root
note<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.380> chord<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.369> note<00:00:26.550> of<00:00:26.730> C

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
note of this chord was the note of C

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.169 
note of this chord was the note of C
we'd<00:00:27.869> refer<00:00:28.080> to<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.650> new<00:00:28.890> chord<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.699> C

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
we'd refer to this new chord as a C

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.530 
we'd refer to this new chord as a C
major<00:00:30.510> 7th<00:00:31.550> some<00:00:32.550> of<00:00:32.700> you<00:00:32.850> might<00:00:33.059> have<00:00:33.090> already

and one thing to bear in mind is that it

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.160 
and one thing to bear in mind is that it
can<00:00:38.370> be<00:00:38.489> written<00:00:38.730> down<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.629> number<00:00:40.020> of

different ways please remember that the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:52.160 
different ways please remember that the
1st<00:00:47.520> 3rd<00:00:48.420> 5th<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.520> 7th<00:00:50.520> notes<00:00:50.850> of<00:00:51.270> any<00:00:51.719> major

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
1st 3rd 5th and 7th notes of any major

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.790 
1st 3rd 5th and 7th notes of any major
scale<00:00:52.500> will<00:00:53.280> always<00:00:54.120> create<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.930> major<00:00:55.320> 7th

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
scale will always create a major 7th

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.590 
scale will always create a major 7th
chord<00:00:56.160> when<00:00:56.460> played<00:00:56.730> together<00:00:56.940> at<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.420> same

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
chord when played together at the same

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.040 
chord when played together at the same
time<00:00:58.010> and<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.640> way<00:00:59.820> we<00:01:00.030> name<00:01:00.300> each<00:01:00.539> chord<00:01:00.870> is

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
time and the way we name each chord is

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.149 
time and the way we name each chord is
easy<00:01:01.550> just<00:01:02.550> name<00:01:02.879> every<00:01:03.660> major<00:01:03.899> 7th<00:01:04.470> using<00:01:05.070> the

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
easy just name every major 7th using the

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.020 
easy just name every major 7th using the
root<00:01:05.369> note<00:01:05.580> each<00:01:05.790> time<00:01:06.229> for<00:01:07.229> example<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:08.700> core

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
root note each time for example the core

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.410 
root note each time for example the core
tones<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.689> an<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:10.080> major<00:01:10.350> scale<00:01:10.799> are<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:12.000> first

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
tones of an a major scale are the first

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:20.300 
tones of an a major scale are the first
and<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:13.670> third<00:01:14.670> C<00:01:15.390> sharp<00:01:16.310> 5th<00:01:17.310> E<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.710> 7th<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.979> G

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
and a third C sharp 5th E and 7th a G

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.630 
and a third C sharp 5th E and 7th a G
sharp<00:01:20.689> so<00:01:21.860> remembering<00:01:22.860> our<00:01:22.979> root<00:01:23.340> notes

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
sharp so remembering our root notes

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.880 
sharp so remembering our root notes
playing<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.600> these<00:01:24.930> core<00:01:25.290> tones<00:01:25.590> together

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
playing all these core tones together

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.090 
playing all these core tones together
would<00:01:26.640> create<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.150> chord<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.840> an<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.290> major<00:01:28.619> 7th

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
would create the chord of an a major 7th

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.350 
would create the chord of an a major 7th
a<00:01:30.530> really<00:01:31.530> nice<00:01:31.710> exercise<00:01:32.130> on<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.670> bass<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.180> to

this<00:02:19.430> together<00:02:19.670> now<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.300> run<00:02:20.569> a<00:02:20.599> little

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:20.989 
this together now and run a little

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.949 
this together now and run a little
exercise<00:02:21.349> with<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:21.860> metronome<00:02:22.480> play<00:02:23.480> with<00:02:23.750> me

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
exercise with the metronome play with me

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.320 
exercise with the metronome play with me
as<00:02:24.080> I<00:02:24.230> go<00:02:24.260> up<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.890> down<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.099> C<00:02:25.550> major<00:02:25.819> seventh

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
as I go up and down a C major seventh

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.990 
as I go up and down a C major seventh
arpeggio<00:02:26.900> four<00:02:27.260> times<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:28.400> doing<00:02:28.849> this

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:29.000 
arpeggio four times and doing this

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.940 
arpeggio four times and doing this
should<00:02:29.269> really<00:02:29.569> help<00:02:29.750> you<00:02:30.110> get<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.410> shape<00:02:30.739> at

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
should really help you get the shape at

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.520 
should really help you get the shape at
the<00:02:31.069> arpeggio<00:02:31.610> under<00:02:31.849> your<00:02:32.000> fingers<00:02:32.530> okay

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
after four one two three four okay this

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.350 
after four one two three four okay this
time<00:03:02.810> let's<00:03:03.530> try<00:03:03.650> combining<00:03:04.130> an<00:03:04.730> ordinary

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360
