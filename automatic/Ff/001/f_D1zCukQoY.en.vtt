00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.909
 very good to all people how are you 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.770
 Welcome to the channel welcome to me 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.509
 first call in the call of duty 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.179
 advanced walk hard good the case is that 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.500
 today I bring you this gameplay I'm not going to 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.509
 neither say what it is that I carry in the 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.440
 departure or what he stopped carrying because the 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.190
 truth is that I think it is completely 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.990
 inconsequential does not have any kind of 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.510
 meaning because besides that it was the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.039
 first game because I did not have very 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.699
 controlled what I have welcomed it a 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.689
 kind of are you predetermined that you 

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.060
 let catch and nothing else 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.340
 otherwise good so tell you my 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.280
 first impressions well it is a 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.010
 so two exactly the same 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.719
 new maps with some different thing 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.870
 with the theme of the jumps that you already know 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.629
 that in this game it is something similar 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.610
 to what is being titan fold and for 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.200
 the rest is more or less what 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.480
 same as any call of duty or 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.370
 Since leaving the call of duty 4 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.620
 go ahead then all the call of duty have 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.289
 gone evolving I will say between 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.210
 quotation marks evolving and have gone 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.550
 adding little things in each of them 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.129
 different whether they are gusts or weapons 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.820
 whether they are accessories or gusts of 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.340
 low 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.010
 or always in each one of them 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.890
 the thing has been varying rather little 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.300
 but good has been changing the case is 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.950
 that a call of duty we already know what it is 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.530
 and it's a call of duty or that's not going to 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.750
 change it nobody and sometimes we complain 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.690
 because it innovates a little and other times we 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.610
 we complain because they innovate too much I am 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.070
 of those who think that good is a call 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.110
 of duty is a game that is what it is 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.630
 play to kill jade opposing team in 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.460
 its different modalities but the rest 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.770
 what is the game itself because it is always 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.170
 the same do not come to the call of duty and the 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.550
 advanced warfare how is this or come the 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.860
 next call of duty is always going to be 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:46.560
 the same is always going to be the same and it's a 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.899
 foolish to complain that if you innovate 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.430
 little is innovated a lot or is that they have 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.770
 changed very few things or this they have 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.240
 put is a crap they do not always have 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.729
 that add something not for the game 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.070
 Well look like it's different and 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.700
 I say different between quotes but the 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.140
 the rest will always be the same but I 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.830
 I think that 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.800
 what really makes a call of 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.450
 Duty be different is the connection because 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.580
 because the game itself is fine is 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.380
 funny is a game to which then 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.270
 we take the time and we're good with the 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.860
 friends we had a good time or sometimes we 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.570
 we're going to sleep because we've been pissed 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.790
 killed too much but yes that's true 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.530
 that the connection issue I think is 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.950
 the most important factor in this type of 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.080
 online games since it is the pre factor 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.900
 determinant to leave you happy 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.330
 happy to bed or you go fucked 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.640
 so they gave you a crash of the ciborium 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.980
 not then the subject of the connection then 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.870
 is something very relative is something that does not 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.000
 because we have 100 200 megabytes we are going to 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.010
 to go better if not the opposite 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.450
 that means we have a good 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.209
 connection and sometimes we have to endure 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.650
 be the host of the game with what by 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.360
 at least in the call of duty world to me 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.760
 I had a lot, they gave it to me and it was 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.580
 infumable or be away from the game 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.340
 was to bear the full weight of everything that 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.709
 I was leaving and I was worse than the rest and 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.200
 whoever has been eyes on occasion 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.329
 he will know it because that works like this 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.740
 On the other hand, tell you that the issue of 

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:15.600
 Connection 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:18.240
 it is not because you have 200 300 and 500 mb you 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.190
 will go better but it depends a lot on 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.690
 the servers you connect me 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.150
 for example to a speed test with 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.710
 my 100 megs but if there is a test 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.630
 speed on a server that I have here 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.880
 next to home, he's going to give me a pin 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.750
 of 3 then what does that mean 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.700
 what ostia 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:34.350
 I am the fucking master you know or I am 3 of 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:36.480
 pin with what if I start playing 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.430
 call of duty I will be the best is not 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:40.320
 so I mean, I'm pinging a 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.540
 server building a test to a 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:44.340
 server that I have next to home is not 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.740
 the same when I get in front of the 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.840
 console I'm looking for a game and it connects me in a 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.930
 American server what is going on 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.970
 that that pin increases a lot always goes 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:56.820
 to have better connection or a lower pin 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.130
 that American who lives a kilometer 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.470
 two kilometers or 30 or 100 kilometers from 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.270
 that server does not like us to the best 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.940
 that we are 10,000 kilometers away 

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.960
 distance with what varies greatly the 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.770
 thing 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.810
 what happens what 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:15.530
 is in this new generation by 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:18.820
 example playstation 4 has given or applied 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.920
 more ball than xbox one in this case 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.840
 xbox because it has stayed a bit in the 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.490
 American sector that is where I was and 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.520
 playstation yes it is true that has 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.750
 happened more than being a European console has 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.140
 stuck a little the jump to the other 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:35.990
 continent and in the us the truth is that it 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:38.480
 they have sold enough playstation 4 that 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.760
 what does it mean when you play in the 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.520
 play the one that touched you a European server 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.760
 it's much easier than not in the xbox with 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.560
 what always the pin or that connection goes 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.540
 to improve it was commented that the 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.490
 servers were going to be dedicated and so on 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.840
 I do not think the servers will be 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.210
 dedicated to nothing because if not the 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.680
 connection would be the same for everyone 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.290
 and that's not true because you see in fact 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.700
 for example in this game in many 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:04.340
 many times more games with a 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.900
 two yellow striped red dot that's not 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.120
 a server dedicated this server 

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.670
 was dedicated to that connection you would see 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.960
 that it would always be the same and it would be 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.630
 perfect that is everyone would not be 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:16.220
 the same is the case that as I said 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.110
 playstation when you 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.000
 game is easier to touch in a 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.370
 European server does not mean that 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.650
 I'll go better but that pin goes to 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.240
 go down with respect to if you will touch with a 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.180
 American server because it is much more 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.490
 far that happens in xbox than in xbox by 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:35.120
 example being the servers more 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:37.730
 located in the US according to what times 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.020
 You play, it's your turn to always connect 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.510
 servers for example that there is in 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.300
 america with what the ping s 

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:46.490
 multiply by 10,000 and then you have 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.350
 a fucking connection does not mean 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.180
 that goes bad because it gives you the 

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:52.480
 feel like you kill but that ping 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.040
 that response time to that latency 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.810
 increases a lot with respect perhaps to 

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.760
 an American rival that you can 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:02.570
 find a game that affects you 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.150
 that then in something that is essential that is 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.130
 in which that person sees you before you or 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.230
 be me for example I am at 10,000 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:11.210
 kilometers of distance connected a 

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:13.490
 server and an American are we going to 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.200
 put 30 kilometers away what he wants 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.300
 say that the response time that 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.800
 has that American with respect to 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:21.169
 server that we have connected to the 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.580
 two is much lower than mine that was 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:24.470
 the best has a 5 pin 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.689
 of 8 if you have a good connection already 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:29.330
 we know that in the USA, everything is 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:32.569
 wired and normally do not go with bad 

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:35.900
 connection and I'm going to have a ping of me 

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:38.810
 I'm going to invent the figure but with 300 that 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:40.969
 what does it mean it was very simple that 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.030
 those milliseconds of difference there are 

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:45.830
 between his 3 pin and my 300 pin 

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:47.870
 it's going to be enough to kill me 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.370
 that's why we complain sometimes and we say 

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:51.650
 ostias that did not win a fucking k'ara 

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:54.259
 k'ara k'ara k'ara because they always see me 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.479
 a few thousandths of a second before me 

00:06:54.259 --> 00:06:58.250
 and I think that good call of duty in 

00:06:56.479 --> 00:07:00.919
 general as I said is therefore the same 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.180
 the only thing that changes are the servers and 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:04.129
 in each of the call of duty we 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.569
 we get angry for the same thing but it's always 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:07.729
 which it is equal and that will never change 

00:07:05.569 --> 00:07:09.560
 so nothing my impressions of this 

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:11.150
 new call of duty then that's a 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.280
 little more of the same is like the whites 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:16.520
 two with new things with the theme of 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:18.050
 the jumps but what they really sin and 

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.060
 will always be the subject of the 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.650
 connection so nothing kids see you 

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:23.300
 in the next video and many, many 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:24.889
 thanks as always for being there 

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.870
 I hope you liked this first
