00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.870
 again here in your sketch to be able 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:17.289
 start drawing today we are going to 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.090
 see a composition made of cubes I do not 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.700
 that some have been requesting for 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.590
 help them in their graphics 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.780
 as always 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.220
 The first thing we are going to do is place 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.220
 the horizon line 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.379
 family 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:46.079
 and we place the vanishing point 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.589
 we will place for it 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.659
 and we started to draw the first cube 

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:53.579
 to draw a cube what we have to 

00:00:51.659 --> 00:00:55.769
 do in this case as it is a point of 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.350
 leak let's draw the face that is 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.589
 in front of us and let's draw 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.589
 the 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.350
 as a square 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:16.650
 try to make one more proportionate 

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:19.470
 I can 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.150
 of each of these vertices we are going to 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.020
 draw a line towards 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.390
 our vanishing point 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.810
 to be able to build the upper face and 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.179
 the right side now where are we going to 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.219
 finish the top in this case 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.490
 as it is a sketch we are not making 

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:42.729
 no geometrical method we are going to 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:45.759
 guide us much of our perception if 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.890
 we put it here surely cotton will say 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.920
 which is a very long face and does not belong 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.679
 a cube and if we put it very close 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.230
 then also let's assume that it is 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:58.800
 over here 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:00.750
 and we cut the cube on this side of how 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.640
 we can rectify with the presence of 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.920
 some other elements 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.740
 if we want to draw a cube that is in 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.030
 this side right and logically if 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.450
 they were of the same proportions 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:16.110
 we can extend these lines 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:18.650
 drawing the same as the previous time a 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.650
 square 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:27.200
 again from each of the great 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.969
 we can launch a line and if it's the 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:32.209
 same played this top line 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:35.069
 will also match the top line 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.769
 from the face of this little 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.719
 very well we go to the other side if 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.640
 is that it is our interest to draw a 

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:45.500
 cube too 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.500
 on the left side 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.329
 and we're going to position it the same way 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:07.020
 and you see me here let's see if it's 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:10.890
 I need you to look, I think it's good 

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:13.020
 then we're going to leave it right there if 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.140
 we want to draw about three cubes in the 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:19.180
 upper part 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.180
 We can continue extending the lines 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.030
 very well and if it is our interest we are going to 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.180
 leave a last cube here in the part 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.180
 higher 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:26.810
 very well we already have them we have all 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.520
 the juices but we're not going to stay in 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.260
 as truth let's do something else 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.630
 interesting let's start to remove from 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.990
 suddenly to these lower faces we are going to 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.920
 take a face off the face of this 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:42.500
 The face in front of the face 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:45.560
 superior to the cubes above we go to 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:48.970
 remove three faces although we will see 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.970
 how this happens by passing the pen 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.330
 Y 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.140
 the world 

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:19.410
 do not
