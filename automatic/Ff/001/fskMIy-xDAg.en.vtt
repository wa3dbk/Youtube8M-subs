00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.940
 never the pressures not just due from 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.990
 what happens in the pressures field 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.660
 they are extreme 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:19.550
 I think it's a trace of 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:21.259
 tension that I pay in football 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.590
 Roman prison is a little different that can 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:26.570
 cut out 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.800
 I speak of fans the atmosphere they conceal 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:32.480
 season 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.770
 football is a little different maybe a little 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.780
 best 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.450
 no I said that while the truth when 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:45.710
 he played me together and did it 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:48.920
 with statistics but I usually restarted 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.110
 of the games are not one that allows the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:56.320
 things before playing then before later 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:01:06.830
 pavia there is a central striker but 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:09.470
 to win the champions but more clarence 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:15.500
 more or less still a footballer is not 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:17.680
 however the team remained a lot 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.750
 clear 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.880
 let them talk about the 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.880
 to explain opinions 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.160
 let's say things are easier 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:38.310
 then quietly return to the level 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:47.590
 there are few if you make a gesture 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:50.530
 plus dad i have a big brother brother 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.960
 in the sixteen are these two cups from 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.850
 part of the circle or the other one 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:08.770
 of the world but you want to take only one 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:11.650
 a certain difficult one succeeded to 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.700
 no one I am very critical in 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.170
 comparisons 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:22.270
 and in fact when you criticize those from 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:23.920
 basten short, however, I need to be 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:29.200
 critical revealing the four 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:31.690
 queries if it can be improved 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.090
 good footballer who know the holder of 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:39.130
 milan an important piece of this 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:41.830
 champions league school is not one 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:44.830
 question I asked myself sincerely 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.920
 I don't care. You must have one 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.940
 team and help the team and win 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.690

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.690
