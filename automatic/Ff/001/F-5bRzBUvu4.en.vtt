 war thunder can be played alone 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.260
 together with a friend or even immediately 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.830
 several friends fight more pleasantly 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.350
 the main thing 

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.450
 more effective in such a case in the game can 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.000
 create temporary squads from two to 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.370
 four people here let's say met 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.199
 you are in the battle of a good pilot or tankman 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.100

 play together 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.900

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.330
 and then add to friends not to 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.250
 lose it in the future now let's 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.760
 invite some friends to the squad 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.290

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.850
 By the way it is all the players with whom you 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.539
 ever played squad showing up 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.630
 in section 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.700
 played together very comfortably as soon as 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.880
 send invitations window opens 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:20.310
 chat and the tab will detach everyone 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.380
 A friend will come to the padva of the notification of one 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.720
 they pop up a window with a button to accept 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.720
 second invitation in chat window 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.000
 Well, our military squad and gathered in 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.460
 left side of the new player list window 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.950
 squad flag next to the name shows 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.229
 chosen to fight the nation if you look 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.630
 on the pilot you can also see two lists 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.090
 equipment that he prepared for battle 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.729
 one arcade in it displays all 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.009
 planes and tanks of the chosen nation 2 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.319
 realistic there you can see one fighting 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.140
 machine of each nation which is chosen from 

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.179
 player this is not done by chance in 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.490
 arcade mode commander need to see 

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.619
 all planes mates so they hit 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.530
 in the battle on the rank in which everyone will 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.170
 comfortable nation in the arcade does not play a role 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.539
 and in realistic and simulator battles 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.670
 players go to battle on the technique of the nation 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.560
 which the squad leader chose in this 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.750
 the case of the column technique serves him 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.030
 hint and did not forget anyone to choose 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.489
 correct plane if a team 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.620
 plans to fly for example on the earliest in 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.930
 plans and someone forgot to remove from the cell 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.959
 single jet fighter 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.480
 the entire squad will throw high-level battles 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.300
 to avoid such embarrassment under 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.819
 the list of players shows the rank of the squad 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.420
 This is the maximum rank of the equipment that 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.159
 have chosen 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.569
 the players 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:39.819
 opposite each player icon 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:42.250
 preparedness against the creator of the group 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.530
 yellow and the others are gray until they 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.750
 confirmed their readiness to start the fight after 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.230
 clicking the button is ready the icon will become 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.870
 green 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.150
 if one player is lost somewhere and you donâ€™t 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.209
 want to wait for it right click on 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.319
 named and then expel from the squad seven 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.010
 one is not expected 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:02.469
 so now everyone is ready to watch in battle 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.299
 except blue allies and red enemies 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:04.870
 there were green markers of ours 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.209
 mates 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.549
 and if you open the tab key statistics 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.180
 names of squad members will also be highlighted 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.459
 green 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.829
 but the main thing is of course not the interface 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:17.169
 Your harmonious link to join the battle 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:19.629
 if you also attended to voice 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.879
 communication type raidcall then coordinating their 

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.950
 actions and covering each other you 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:26.079
 can seriously affect the result 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.230
 combat even if the rest of the team plays 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.329
 a little competent and hot but the troops are not 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:33.340
 the crown of the social component of war 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:36.010
 thunder larger constant 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.260
 education is a regiment in the games of others 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:40.569
 genres he would be called for example clan 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.900
 or guilds each regiment has 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:46.120

 and an ordinary officer can take or 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.000
 reject applications to join the regiment 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:59.409
 exclude players and moderate spell 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.079
 the commander above that can change 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.870
 regiment data to give rank and if suddenly

 five hundred golden eagles and he is yours and you 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.470
 his first commander only in advance 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.819
 think about the name in the future if you 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.159
 want to change it 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.920

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.580
 lock next to the name 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.230
 to close the set however much 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.300
 novice players and would rather 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.150
 advised not to make his regiment and 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.770
 apply to one of the existing ones

 can not more than one application to 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.530
 submit one more will have to first 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.780

 communities take green newbies 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:01.220
 shelves with good officer statistics 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.850
 be sure to look at your card 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.550
 player 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.650
 if you are a pilot, you will pay special attention 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:09.050
 on the ratio of downed enemies to the number 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:12.140
 departures and it is desirable that she was like 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.660
 at least more than one but if tankman 

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:17.060
 there are no established standards yet 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:17.750
 Yes, and tank statistics in the game is not yet 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.240
 final 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.930
 what's the plus part to play 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.970
 shelf 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.710
 Well, besides the obvious that close by 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.320
 There are always proven players to 

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:29.300
 go fly a squad to the first 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.000

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.820
 events special fights not available to players 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.340

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.160

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:57.470
 biweekly award gold 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.410
 eagles but not all members of the regiment 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:03.460
 but only 20 people with the highest inside 

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:03.460
 regimental rating 

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:08.850
 Well, another reason to join 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.960

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.330
 way to eSports 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.310
 after all, although formally the game is still in 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.980
 beta testing on it already 

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:18.150
 pass international tournaments 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.730
 serious prize pools 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.560
 and they participate mainly 

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:24.560
 teams from leading regiments 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:32.180
 that's all about the regiments and troops to be friends and 

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.509
 communicate and play together good luck on 

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:34.509
