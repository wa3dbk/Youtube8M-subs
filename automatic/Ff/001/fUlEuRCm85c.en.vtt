wrench<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.630> you'll<00:02:00.840> need<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.079> biggest<00:02:01.409> side

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
wrench and you'll need the biggest side

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.499 
wrench and you'll need the biggest side
and<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.520> to<00:02:02.670> get<00:02:02.820> more<00:02:03.000> torque<00:02:03.299> without

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
and just to get more torque without

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.209 
and just to get more torque without
stripping<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.020> what<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.200> use<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.649> I<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.100> use

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
stripping and what I use is I just use

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.429 
stripping and what I use is I just use
an<00:02:05.340> allen<00:02:05.610> wrench<00:02:05.640> tool<00:02:06.000> is<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.960> park<00:02:07.200> tool

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
an allen wrench tool is the park tool

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.070 
an allen wrench tool is the park tool
and<00:02:08.220> I<00:02:08.910> still<00:02:09.179> get<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.360> other<00:02:09.479> side<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.929> way

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
and I still get the other side that way

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.859 
and I still get the other side that way
and<00:02:10.289> having

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
and having

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.330 
and having

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:12.340 
have more tort tort you know when I'm

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.399 
have more tort tort you know when I'm
turning<00:02:13.299> the<00:02:14.190> in<00:02:15.190> today's<00:02:15.370> only<00:02:15.760> one<00:02:16.000> them

turning the in today's only one them

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:19.949 
turning the in today's only one them
will<00:02:17.409> nuts<00:02:17.650> so<00:02:18.580> don't<00:02:19.060> lose<00:02:19.239> those<00:02:19.450> cuz<00:02:19.780> you'll

you don't need those so go ahead and set
these<00:02:22.330> tools<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:22.930> then<00:02:23.080> we<00:02:23.170> will<00:02:23.260> not<00:02:23.379> aside

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
these tools and then we will not aside

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.839 
these tools and then we will not aside
and<00:02:24.370> let's<00:02:24.819> get<00:02:24.970> to<00:02:25.090> the<00:02:25.180> tire<00:02:25.590> now<00:02:26.590> this<00:02:27.549> tire

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:27.849 
and let's get to the tire now this tire

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:29.850 
and let's get to the tire now this tire
if<00:02:28.060> you<00:02:28.150> can<00:02:28.299> see<00:02:28.510> here<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:29.200> pretty<00:02:29.560> worn

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
if you can see here it's pretty worn

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.830 
if you can see here it's pretty worn
down<00:02:29.950> like<00:02:30.220> i<00:02:30.340> said<00:02:30.489> earlier<00:02:30.519> but<00:02:31.060> what<00:02:31.750> I'm

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
down like i said earlier but what I'm

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.199 
down like i said earlier but what I'm
having<00:02:32.079> problems<00:02:32.290> is<00:02:32.980> within<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.519> backboards

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
having problems is within the backboards

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.789 
having problems is within the backboards
you<00:02:34.420> know<00:02:34.540> spinning<00:02:35.079> and<00:02:35.290> getting<00:02:35.560> all<00:02:35.680> the

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
you know spinning and getting all the

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:40.020 
you know spinning and getting all the
high<00:02:36.040> high<00:02:36.909> RPM<00:02:37.329> torque<00:02:37.769> the<00:02:38.769> actual<00:02:39.250> tire<00:02:39.760> is

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
high high RPM torque the actual tire is

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.699 
high high RPM torque the actual tire is
starting<00:02:40.450> to<00:02:40.540> slip<00:02:40.720> off<00:02:40.900> the<00:02:40.959> bead<00:02:41.260> meaning

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:41.709 
starting to slip off the bead meaning

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.250 
starting to slip off the bead meaning
the<00:02:41.829> glue<00:02:42.069> is<00:02:42.310> either<00:02:42.599> you<00:02:43.599> know<00:02:43.690> coming<00:02:43.900> apart

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
the glue is either you know coming apart

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.080 
the glue is either you know coming apart
dry<00:02:44.769> or<00:02:45.099> were<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.430> know<00:02:45.519> it's<00:02:45.670> obviously<00:02:45.970> to

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
dry or were you know it's obviously to

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.030 
dry or were you know it's obviously to
drive<00:02:46.359> but<00:02:46.540> it's<00:02:46.750> just<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.049> know<00:02:47.170> loosening

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
drive but it's just you know loosening

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.610 
drive but it's just you know loosening
up<00:02:48.250> and<00:02:48.519> it's<00:02:48.670> not<00:02:48.849> sticking<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:50.200> tire<00:02:50.410> to<00:02:50.590> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
up and it's not sticking the tire to the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.280 
up and it's not sticking the tire to the
bead<00:02:50.890> so<00:02:51.329> first<00:02:52.329> I<00:02:52.450> what<00:02:52.629> you<00:02:52.750> want<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:52.989> do<00:02:53.079> is

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
of peel it back just a bit and spying

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.220 
of peel it back just a bit and spying
where<00:02:57.970> it's<00:02:58.120> attached<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.450> where<00:02:58.840> it's<00:02:58.959> not

where it's attached to where it's not

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.069 
where it's attached to where it's not
now<00:02:59.950> obviously<00:03:00.099> here<00:03:00.760> if<00:03:01.329> you<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.480> can<00:03:01.629> see<00:03:01.840> is

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
now obviously here if you I can see is

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.949 
now obviously here if you I can see is
pretty<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.950> pest<00:03:03.640> pretty<00:03:04.000> and<00:03:04.239> now<00:03:04.390> as<00:03:04.540> I<00:03:04.659> feed

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
pretty a pest pretty and now as I feed

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.009 
pretty a pest pretty and now as I feed
along<00:03:05.079> I<00:03:05.500> notice<00:03:06.010> right<00:03:06.250> there<00:03:06.730> is<00:03:07.030> where<00:03:07.870> it

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
along I notice right there is where it

starts tarts to come off and pretty much
you<00:03:10.599> can<00:03:10.780> see<00:03:10.989> that<00:03:11.019> this<00:03:11.379> tire<00:03:11.739> is<00:03:12.510> off<00:03:13.510> quite

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
you can see that this tire is off quite

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.559 
you can see that this tire is off quite
a<00:03:14.319> bit<00:03:14.409> then<00:03:14.650> it<00:03:14.769> ends<00:03:14.980> right<00:03:15.040> there<00:03:15.160> so<00:03:15.609> what

00:03:16.559 --> 00:03:16.569

know where your tire is loosened where

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.420 
know where your tire is loosened where
it's<00:03:25.299> not<00:03:25.480> in<00:03:25.720> market<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.950> Martha<00:03:27.310> two

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
it's not in market it's Martha two

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.159 
it's not in market it's Martha two
points<00:03:27.790> not<00:03:27.970> as<00:03:28.150> if<00:03:28.299> you're<00:03:28.450> applying<00:03:28.569> a<00:03:28.959> tire

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:29.169 
points not as if you're applying a tire

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.740 
points not as if you're applying a tire
that's<00:03:29.379> a<00:03:29.530> bit<00:03:29.680> different<00:03:29.919> yo<00:03:30.849> you<00:03:31.120> do<00:03:31.299> you

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
that's a bit different yo you do you

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.180 
that's a bit different yo you do you
obviously<00:03:32.079> do<00:03:32.200> not<00:03:32.230> need<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.590> mark<00:03:32.769> anything

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
obviously do not need to mark anything

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.089 
obviously do not need to mark anything
and<00:03:33.400> that's<00:03:33.970> a<00:03:34.150> it's<00:03:34.750> a<00:03:34.930> bit<00:03:35.169> of<00:03:35.379> a<00:03:35.769> different

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
and that's a it's a bit of a different

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.860 
and that's a it's a bit of a different
process<00:03:36.310> installing<00:03:37.090> around<00:03:37.359> you<00:03:37.599> know<00:03:37.690> that

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
process installing around you know that

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.050 
process installing around you know that
the<00:03:38.019> installation<00:03:38.769> and<00:03:39.099> the<00:03:39.280> tire<00:03:39.489> of<00:03:39.730> the<00:03:39.849> top

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060

can get it in the picture here is peel

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.890 
can get it in the picture here is peel
back<00:04:09.040> enough<00:04:09.419> to<00:04:10.419> where<00:04:10.540> you<00:04:10.629> can<00:04:10.750> see<00:04:10.870> the

back enough to where you can see the

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.920 
back enough to where you can see the
bead<00:04:11.169> and<00:04:11.669> now<00:04:12.669> these<00:04:12.790> are<00:04:13.000> not<00:04:13.180> be<00:04:13.419> lots<00:04:13.720> of

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
bead and now these are not be lots of

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.520 
bead and now these are not be lots of
course<00:04:14.410> but<00:04:14.560> you<00:04:14.799> want<00:04:15.010> to<00:04:15.099> be<00:04:15.940> able<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.209> see

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
course but you want to be able to see

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.229 
course but you want to be able to see
obviously<00:04:17.530> if<00:04:17.739> i<00:04:17.949> mean<00:04:18.370> i<00:04:18.579> can't<00:04:18.909> show<00:04:19.000> the

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
obviously if i mean i can't show the

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.200 
obviously if i mean i can't show the
full<00:04:19.419> rim<00:04:19.630> but<00:04:20.019> what<00:04:20.200> you<00:04:20.320> have<00:04:20.530> is<00:04:20.799> a<00:04:21.039> space<00:04:22.030> in

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
full rim but what you have is a space in

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.830 
full rim but what you have is a space in
the<00:04:22.240> middle

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
the middle

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.840 
the middle
then<00:04:24.110> you<00:04:24.260> have<00:04:24.470> one<00:04:24.949> Ridge<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.550> then<00:04:25.760> the

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
then you have one Ridge and then the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.750 
then you have one Ridge and then the
outer<00:04:26.030> Ridge<00:04:26.419> now<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.710> actual<00:04:28.040> beam<00:04:28.370> or<00:04:28.639> the

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
outer Ridge now the actual beam or the

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.270 
outer Ridge now the actual beam or the

entire the tightest to lie on with the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.210 
entire the tightest to lie on with the

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220 
glue lays is in between the two outer

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.270 
glue lays is in between the two outer
ridges<00:04:34.669> and<00:04:35.169> pretty<00:04:36.169> much<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.800> inside<00:04:37.130> of<00:04:37.160> the

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
ridges and pretty much the inside of the

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.629 
ridges and pretty much the inside of the
tire<00:04:37.430> rely<00:04:37.850> on<00:04:38.210> this<00:04:38.889> outside<00:04:39.889> portion<00:04:40.190> of<00:04:40.490> the

tire rely on this outside portion of the
inner<00:04:41.150> Ridge<00:04:41.389> and<00:04:41.860> then<00:04:42.860> this<00:04:43.040> outer<00:04:43.250> edge

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:43.490 
inner Ridge and then this outer edge

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.430 
inner Ridge and then this outer edge
will<00:04:43.699> see<00:04:43.850> low<00:04:44.000> or<00:04:44.150> the<00:04:44.240> other<00:04:44.389> side<00:04:44.690> so<00:04:45.320> that

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
will see low or the other side so that

have our glue and it is a CA glue thank
you<00:04:52.550> know<00:04:52.639> quick<00:04:52.880> drying<00:04:53.270> very<00:04:53.740> very

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
you know quick drying very very

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:57.310 
you know quick drying very very
efficient<00:04:55.220> for<00:04:55.550> repairing<00:04:56.300> tyrus<00:04:56.780> them<00:04:57.020> but<00:04:57.290> I

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:57.320 
efficient for repairing tyrus them but I

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.830 
efficient for repairing tyrus them but I
wouldn't<00:04:57.620> really<00:04:57.710> use<00:04:57.830> it<00:04:58.130> for<00:04:58.660> putting<00:04:59.660> on

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
wouldn't really use it for putting on

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.640 
wouldn't really use it for putting on
fresh<00:05:00.050> tires<00:05:00.169> and<00:05:01.630> so<00:05:02.630> you<00:05:02.990> know<00:05:03.050> you<00:05:03.200> take<00:05:03.350> it

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
fresh tires and so you know you take it

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.820 
fresh tires and so you know you take it
you<00:05:03.830> cut<00:05:04.040> the<00:05:04.130> tip<00:05:04.340> off<00:05:04.520> and<00:05:04.940> basically<00:05:05.389> I

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
you cut the tip off and basically I

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.530 
you cut the tip off and basically I
can't<00:05:06.830> exactly<00:05:07.160> show<00:05:07.340> it<00:05:07.580> in<00:05:07.669> the<00:05:07.729> video<00:05:07.880> but<00:05:08.479> I

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
can't exactly show it in the video but I

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:10.450 
can't exactly show it in the video but I
already<00:05:08.840> demonstrate<00:05:09.440> how<00:05:09.590> you<00:05:09.620> blew<00:05:10.310> it<00:05:10.430> on

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:10.460 
already demonstrate how you blew it on

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.450 
already demonstrate how you blew it on
so<00:05:10.990> well<00:05:11.990> like<00:05:12.260> I<00:05:12.350> said<00:05:12.470> again<00:05:12.830> take<00:05:13.100> your<00:05:13.220> tire

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
so well like I said again take your tire

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.270 
so well like I said again take your tire
and<00:05:13.760> the<00:05:14.030> part<00:05:14.270> of<00:05:14.419> it<00:05:14.510> that's<00:05:14.630> come<00:05:15.200> off<00:05:15.410> then

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:16.280 
and the part of it that's come off then

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.640 
and the part of it that's come off then
now<00:05:16.400> since<00:05:16.639> this<00:05:16.760> is<00:05:16.970> a<00:05:17.000> CA<00:05:17.539> put<00:05:18.229> drying<00:05:18.560> glue

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
now since this is a CA put drying glue

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.290 
now since this is a CA put drying glue
you<00:05:18.889> want<00:05:19.070> to<00:05:19.130> put<00:05:19.310> almost<00:05:19.610> put<00:05:19.880> it<00:05:19.970> in<00:05:20.090> place

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
you want to put almost put it in place

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.760 
you want to put almost put it in place
peel<00:05:20.750> it<00:05:20.840> back<00:05:20.870> a<00:05:21.020> little<00:05:21.110> bit<00:05:21.410> where<00:05:21.590> you<00:05:21.620> can

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:21.770 
peel it back a little bit where you can

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.790 
peel it back a little bit where you can
see<00:05:21.979> fair<00:05:22.729> lady<00:05:22.940> you're<00:05:23.389> barely<00:05:23.690> see<00:05:24.050> the

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:28.900 
second the second inner bead and you
what<00:05:27.440> you<00:05:27.530> want<00:05:27.650> to<00:05:27.710> do<00:05:27.830> it<00:05:28.010> or<00:05:28.220> what<00:05:28.639> you<00:05:28.760> want

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:28.910 
what you want to do it or what you want

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:32.469 
what you want to do it or what you want
to<00:05:28.970> do<00:05:29.090> is<00:05:29.270> is<00:05:29.570> pay<00:05:30.139> much<00:05:30.550> put<00:05:31.550> enough<00:05:31.970> to<00:05:32.300> where

00:05:32.469 --> 00:05:32.479 
to do is is pay much put enough to where

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.590 
to do is is pay much put enough to where
it<00:05:32.690> leaks<00:05:33.050> out<00:05:33.260> maybe<00:05:33.950> a<00:05:34.190> millimeter<00:05:34.700> you<00:05:35.450> can

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
it leaks out maybe a millimeter you can

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.230 
it leaks out maybe a millimeter you can
kind<00:05:35.690> of<00:05:35.810> see<00:05:35.870> it<00:05:36.110> soaking<00:05:36.530> out<00:05:36.680> but<00:05:37.669> not<00:05:37.880> too

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
kind of see it soaking out but not too

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.290 
kind of see it soaking out but not too
much<00:05:38.270> because<00:05:39.070> you<00:05:40.070> don't<00:05:40.310> want<00:05:40.400> to<00:05:40.849> overflow

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
much because you don't want to overflow

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.600 
much because you don't want to overflow
in<00:05:41.419> the<00:05:41.510> rim<00:05:41.690> but<00:05:42.440> then<00:05:42.590> again<00:05:42.710> you<00:05:43.099> don't<00:05:43.460> want

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
in the rim but then again you don't want

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.820 
in the rim but then again you don't want
to<00:05:44.450> little<00:05:44.750> blue<00:05:44.870> ok<00:05:45.289> because<00:05:45.470> it's<00:05:45.560> always

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:45.830 
to little blue ok because it's always

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.170 
to little blue ok because it's always
better<00:05:46.039> to<00:05:46.160> have<00:05:46.250> too<00:05:46.550> much<00:05:46.580> than<00:05:46.789> too<00:05:47.060> little

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 
better to have too much than too little

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.930 
better to have too much than too little
because<00:05:47.570> get<00:05:48.229> too<00:05:48.440> little<00:05:48.770> I<00:05:48.950> mean<00:05:49.820> you

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
because get too little I mean you

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.070 
because get too little I mean you
haven't<00:05:50.120> you<00:05:50.270> have<00:05:50.389> enough<00:05:50.630> to<00:05:50.750> cover<00:05:50.900> the

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
haven't you have enough to cover the

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:52.870 
haven't you have enough to cover the
tire<00:05:51.289> but<00:05:51.560> it'll<00:05:52.190> just<00:05:52.370> wear<00:05:52.520> off<00:05:52.669> but<00:05:52.849> you

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
tire but it'll just wear off but you

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.490 
tire but it'll just wear off but you
can't<00:05:53.150> put<00:05:53.330> anymore<00:05:53.510> on<00:05:53.690> because<00:05:54.020> it's<00:05:54.169> stuck

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:54.500 
can't put anymore on because it's stuck

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.010 
can't put anymore on because it's stuck
and<00:05:54.710> you<00:05:54.740> can't<00:05:55.010> peel<00:05:55.220> it<00:05:55.400> back<00:05:55.430> so<00:05:56.210> a<00:05:56.240> bit<00:05:56.810> too

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
and you can't peel it back so a bit too

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.680 
and you can't peel it back so a bit too
much<00:05:57.050> is<00:05:57.500> better<00:05:57.740> than<00:05:57.950> a<00:05:58.010> bit<00:05:58.280> too<00:05:58.460> little<00:05:58.849> so

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
much is better than a bit too little so

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:01.810 
much is better than a bit too little so
once<00:05:59.870> again<00:05:59.990> you<00:06:00.410> are<00:06:00.440> if<00:06:01.370> I<00:06:01.460> can<00:06:01.580> get<00:06:01.639> it<00:06:01.760> in

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:01.820 
once again you are if I can get it in

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.730 
once again you are if I can get it in
the<00:06:01.940> picture<00:06:02.090> you<00:06:02.419> peel<00:06:02.570> it<00:06:02.599> back<00:06:02.720> kind<00:06:03.710> of

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
the picture you peel it back kind of

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.529 
the picture you peel it back kind of
squirting<00:06:04.070> along<00:06:04.310> the<00:06:04.430> lines<00:06:04.639> and<00:06:05.300> then<00:06:05.419> you

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
squirting along the lines and then you

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:08.620 
squirting along the lines and then you
just<00:06:05.660> push<00:06:05.810> it<00:06:05.840> back<00:06:06.080> in<00:06:06.260> and<00:06:06.789> make<00:06:07.789> sure<00:06:07.820> since

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:08.630 
just push it back in and make sure since

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.300 
just push it back in and make sure since
this<00:06:08.720> again<00:06:09.050> this<00:06:09.139> is<00:06:09.440> it<00:06:09.590> this<00:06:09.830> since<00:06:10.010> this<00:06:10.130> is

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
this again this is it this since this is

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.089 
this again this is it this since this is
a<00:06:10.340> squid<00:06:10.820> drying<00:06:11.090> glue<00:06:11.229> that<00:06:12.229> you<00:06:12.470> pretty<00:06:12.979> much

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:13.099 
a squid drying glue that you pretty much

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:16.440 
a squid drying glue that you pretty much
have<00:06:13.490> it<00:06:13.520> in<00:06:13.700> place<00:06:13.970> within<00:06:14.720> about<00:06:15.190> maximum

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
have it in place within about maximum

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:19.330 
have it in place within about maximum
six<00:06:17.450> seconds<00:06:17.900> they<00:06:18.530> say<00:06:18.710> about<00:06:18.860> you<00:06:19.250> know

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
six seconds they say about you know

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.370 
six seconds they say about you know
you're<00:06:19.520> from<00:06:19.550> like<00:06:19.820> three<00:06:20.150> to<00:06:20.270> five<00:06:20.479> but

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.380 
you're from like three to five but

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.140 
you're from like three to five but
maximum<00:06:22.039> six<00:06:22.310> is<00:06:22.520> when<00:06:22.700> it's<00:06:22.849> pretty<00:06:23.030> much

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:23.150 
maximum six is when it's pretty much

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.950 
maximum six is when it's pretty much
dried<00:06:23.510> um<00:06:24.729> since<00:06:25.729> is<00:06:25.820> it<00:06:25.940> is<00:06:26.090> since<00:06:26.419> this<00:06:26.570> is<00:06:26.810> a

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
dried um since is it is since this is a

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.960 
dried um since is it is since this is a
see<00:06:27.020> a<00:06:27.229> quick<00:06:27.530> drying<00:06:27.800> glue<00:06:27.889> so<00:06:28.280> you<00:06:28.849> have

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:28.970 
see a quick drying glue so you have

00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:31.450 
see a quick drying glue so you have
about<00:06:29.120> five<00:06:29.450> seconds<00:06:29.960> to<00:06:30.289> actually<00:06:30.770> put<00:06:31.250> it<00:06:31.280> in

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:31.460 
about five seconds to actually put it in

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:34.330 
about five seconds to actually put it in
there<00:06:32.140> put<00:06:33.140> the<00:06:33.229> tire<00:06:33.409> back<00:06:33.440> on<00:06:33.740> the<00:06:33.830> bead<00:06:34.010> kind

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:34.340 
there put the tire back on the bead kind

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:34.850 
there put the tire back on the bead kind
of<00:06:34.400> you<00:06:34.490> know

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860

00:06:37.249 --> 00:06:37.259 
put back over and let it dry because if

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:39.350 
put back over and let it dry because if
you<00:06:37.379> screw<00:06:37.650> up<00:06:37.710> then<00:06:38.069> you<00:06:38.789> gotta<00:06:38.969> wait<00:06:39.180> you

got<00:06:40.949> to<00:06:41.039> get<00:06:41.129> new<00:06:41.219> tires<00:06:41.430> so<00:06:41.879> be<00:06:42.629> cautious<00:06:43.199> and

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:43.650 
got to get new tires so be cautious and

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.649 
got to get new tires so be cautious and
weary<00:06:43.860> that<00:06:44.129> and<00:06:44.340> remember<00:06:44.639> a<00:06:45.030> bit<00:06:45.330> too<00:06:45.479> much

00:06:45.649 --> 00:06:45.659 
weary that and remember a bit too much

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:48.020 
weary that and remember a bit too much
the<00:06:45.930> better<00:06:46.139> than<00:06:46.349> a<00:06:46.379> bit<00:06:46.590> too<00:06:46.770> little<00:06:47.069> alright

everyone<00:06:48.240> so<00:06:48.539> this<00:06:48.689> is<00:06:48.780> where<00:06:48.960> the<00:06:49.050> tide

00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 
everyone so this is where the tide

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:51.020 
everyone so this is where the tide
should<00:06:49.530> look<00:06:49.710> like<00:06:49.740> when<00:06:49.949> you're<00:06:50.219> done<00:06:50.490> gluing

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:51.030 
should look like when you're done gluing

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.659 
should look like when you're done gluing
and<00:06:51.689> as<00:06:51.810> you<00:06:51.990> notice<00:06:52.139> it's<00:06:52.439> nice<00:06:52.680> firmly

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:53.669 
and as you notice it's nice firmly

00:06:53.669 --> 00:06:56.899 
and as you notice it's nice firmly
sealed<00:06:54.300> down<00:06:54.509> if<00:06:54.719> y'all<00:06:54.870> concede<00:06:55.199> this<00:06:55.460> um<00:06:56.460> now

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:56.909 
sealed down if y'all concede this um now

00:06:56.909 --> 00:06:58.909 
sealed down if y'all concede this um now
it<00:06:57.240> wasn't<00:06:57.750> a<00:06:57.780> perfect<00:06:58.020> seal<00:06:58.409> because<00:06:58.590> there's

00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 
it wasn't a perfect seal because there's

00:06:58.919 --> 00:07:00.499 
it wasn't a perfect seal because there's
a<00:06:59.009> little<00:06:59.189> bit<00:06:59.340> of<00:06:59.400> space<00:06:59.639> right<00:06:59.879> there<00:07:00.030> but<00:07:00.300> I

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:00.509 
a little bit of space right there but I

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:02.749 
a little bit of space right there but I
added<00:07:01.349> some<00:07:01.379> excess<00:07:01.889> glue<00:07:02.099> so<00:07:02.430> that<00:07:02.460> should

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:02.759 
added some excess glue so that should

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:04.279 
added some excess glue so that should
cover<00:07:02.909> it<00:07:03.120> from<00:07:03.180> you<00:07:03.330> know<00:07:03.389> any<00:07:03.539> water<00:07:03.810> or<00:07:03.960> dirt
