00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
you have that's just mainly for

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.890 
you have that's just mainly for
uninstalling<00:00:18.439> applications<00:00:20.660> we'll<00:00:21.660> go<00:00:21.810> ahead

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
uninstalling applications we'll go ahead

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:28.279 
uninstalling applications we'll go ahead
and<00:00:22.050> jump<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:22.439> CC<00:00:22.949> cleaner<00:00:23.340> here<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:27.289> think

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
and jump in the CC cleaner here I think

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.939 
and jump in the CC cleaner here I think
with<00:00:29.160> this<00:00:29.449> if<00:00:30.449> your<00:00:30.750> history<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.170> checked<00:00:31.590> and

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
with this if your history is checked and

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.310 
with this if your history is checked and
you<00:00:32.040> go<00:00:32.250> if<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.520> use<00:00:32.910> your<00:00:33.120> history<00:00:33.540> near<00:00:33.780> x4

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
you go if you use your history near x4

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.080 
you go if you use your history near x4
or<00:00:35.360> firefox<00:00:36.590> then<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:38.160> will<00:00:38.309> be<00:00:38.460> deleted<00:00:38.730> if

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
or firefox then that will be deleted if

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.590 
or firefox then that will be deleted if
this<00:00:39.540> is<00:00:39.750> check<00:00:40.079> so<00:00:40.739> if<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.059> use<00:00:42.059> your<00:00:42.210> history

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
this is check so if you use your history

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.630 
this is check so if you use your history
