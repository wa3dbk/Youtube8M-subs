00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
and as soon as I take my hands out that

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.920 
and as soon as I take my hands out that
side<00:02:04.229> pops<00:02:04.979> up<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.549> I<00:02:05.909> feel<00:02:06.119> very<00:02:06.329> secure<00:02:06.630> with

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
side pops up and I feel very secure with

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.680 
side pops up and I feel very secure with
the<00:02:07.290> way<00:02:07.469> that<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.220> moves<00:02:08.879> around<00:02:09.060> her<00:02:09.509> and

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the way that it moves around her and

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.770 
the way that it moves around her and
protects<00:02:10.410> her<00:02:10.670> when<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.700> think<00:02:11.819> of<00:02:12.120> halo<00:02:12.540> I

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
protects her when I think of halo I

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.670 
protects her when I think of halo I
definitely<00:02:13.230> think

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
definitely think

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.789 
definitely think
safe<00:02:14.219> sleep<00:02:14.609> environments<00:02:15.390> I<00:02:15.569> think<00:02:16.200> of<00:02:16.439> the

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:16.799 
safe sleep environments I think of the

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.490 
safe sleep environments I think of the
swaddle<00:02:17.280> that<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:17.760> used<00:02:18.209> from<00:02:18.599> the<00:02:18.719> hospital<00:02:19.200> I

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
swaddle that I used from the hospital I

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.740 
swaddle that I used from the hospital I
think<00:02:19.890> about<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.640> sleepsack<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.359> I<00:02:21.390> used

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
think about the sleepsack that I used

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.569 
think about the sleepsack that I used
and<00:02:22.049> once<00:02:22.530> maybe<00:02:22.859> we<00:02:22.980> got<00:02:23.099> out<00:02:23.219> of<00:02:23.340> swaddling

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:23.579 
and once maybe we got out of swaddling

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.899 
and once maybe we got out of swaddling
and<00:02:24.200> with<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.319> bass<00:02:25.469> anest<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.250> falls<00:02:26.730> right

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
and with the bass anest it falls right

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.920 
and with the bass anest it falls right
along<00:02:27.569> lines<00:02:27.959> of<00:02:28.260> that<00:02:29.219> same<00:02:29.609> safety<00:02:30.209> feeling

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
along lines of that same safety feeling

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.099 
along lines of that same safety feeling
that<00:02:31.620> I'm<00:02:31.950> close<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.730> and<00:02:33.329> protecting<00:02:33.959> my
