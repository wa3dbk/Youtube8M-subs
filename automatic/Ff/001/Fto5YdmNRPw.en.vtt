there's this course and then medium and

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:43.069 
there's this course and then medium and

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
fine and then it comes with some honing

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.819 
fine and then it comes with some honing
solution<00:01:45.079> this<00:01:46.079> is<00:01:46.140> what<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.530> want<00:01:46.649> to<00:01:46.740> have

solution this is what you want to have
on<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:46.950> stone<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.579> on<00:01:47.729> the<00:01:47.820> blade<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.740> you<00:01:49.740> get

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
on the stone and on the blade so you get

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.690 
on the stone and on the blade so you get
a<00:01:49.950> smoother<00:01:50.520> grind<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.530> then<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:53.430> is<00:01:53.579> what

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
a smoother grind and then this is what

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.429

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
give you an idea about what angle to

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.810 
give you an idea about what angle to
hold<00:02:35.360> it<00:02:35.480> at<00:02:35.630> and<00:02:36.370> you're<00:02:37.370> kind<00:02:37.580> of<00:02:37.610> off<00:02:37.790> on

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
hold it at and you're kind of off on

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.030 
hold it at and you're kind of off on
your<00:02:38.150> own<00:02:38.300> from<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.570> point<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:38.960> for<00:02:39.920> this

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
your own from that point on for this

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:43.570 
your own from that point on for this
machete<00:02:40.490> it's<00:02:40.760> not<00:02:40.940> real<00:02:41.150> critical<00:02:42.340> I'm<00:02:43.340> gonna

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580 
machete it's not real critical I'm gonna

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:46.810 
machete it's not real critical I'm gonna
do<00:02:43.730> probably<00:02:43.970> closer<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.630> 25<00:02:45.260> degrees<00:02:45.710> than<00:02:45.980> 21

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
do probably closer to 25 degrees than 21

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:47.980 
do probably closer to 25 degrees than 21
22<00:02:47.390> degrees

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
22 degrees

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.850 
22 degrees
this<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.160> 23<00:02:49.790> right<00:02:50.180> in<00:02:50.300> the<00:02:50.360> middle<00:02:50.860> just

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
this is 23 right in the middle just

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.920 
this is 23 right in the middle just
because<00:02:52.280> I<00:02:52.490> want<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:52.850> this<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.510> be<00:02:53.630> a<00:02:53.660> little

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
because I want this this to be a little

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:56.410 
because I want this this to be a little
bit<00:02:54.140> stronger<00:02:54.620> 20<00:02:55.130> degrees<00:02:55.459> 21<00:02:55.820> degrees<00:02:56.120> might

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
bit stronger 20 degrees 21 degrees might

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.199 
bit stronger 20 degrees 21 degrees might
make<00:02:56.690> the<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:58.220> edge<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.430> little<00:02:58.670> too<00:03:01.209> easily

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
make the the edge a little too easily

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.410 
make the the edge a little too easily
chipped<00:03:02.810> too<00:03:03.770> thin<00:03:04.100> so<00:03:06.910> let<00:03:07.910> me<00:03:08.000> see<00:03:08.150> what<00:03:08.300> else

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
chipped too thin so let me see what else

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.790 
chipped too thin so let me see what else
is<00:03:08.570> in<00:03:08.690> here<00:03:08.720> I<00:03:09.110> don't<00:03:09.380> believe<00:03:09.620> there's

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
is in here I don't believe there's

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.500 
is in here I don't believe there's
anything<00:03:10.010> else<00:03:12.880> okay<00:03:13.880> let<00:03:14.030> me<00:03:14.090> just<00:03:14.240> show<00:03:14.420> you

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:14.510 
anything else okay let me just show you

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.770 
anything else okay let me just show you
the<00:03:14.630> box<00:03:15.790> I've<00:03:16.790> had<00:03:16.970> this<00:03:17.120> thing<00:03:17.300> for<00:03:17.360> a<00:03:17.570> while

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
the box I've had this thing for a while

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:40.780 
the box I've had this thing for a while
so<00:03:18.260> it's<00:03:18.530> a<00:03:18.590> little<00:03:18.769> beat<00:03:18.950> up

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.619 

okay<00:03:42.549> for<00:03:43.549> something<00:03:43.879> like<00:03:44.090> this<00:03:44.330> we're<00:03:44.569> you

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:44.629 
okay for something like this we're you

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:50.289 
okay for something like this we're you
gonna<00:03:44.720> take<00:03:44.959> off<00:03:45.170> a<00:03:45.200> lot<00:03:45.650> of<00:03:45.680> material<00:03:49.269> what<00:03:50.269> a

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
gonna take off a lot of material what a

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:51.640 
gonna take off a lot of material what a
lot<00:03:50.510> of<00:03:50.540> people<00:03:50.750> will<00:03:50.959> do<00:03:51.170> is<00:03:51.290> they'll<00:03:51.439> take<00:03:51.590> a

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
lot of people will do is they'll take a

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.039 
lot of people will do is they'll take a
grinder<00:03:51.920> to<00:03:52.159> the<00:03:52.370> edge<00:03:52.519> you<00:03:52.849> know<00:03:53.599> give<00:03:53.930> it

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
grinder to the edge you know give it

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:57.190 
grinder to the edge you know give it
some<00:03:54.730> give<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:55.879> it<00:03:56.000> that<00:03:56.329> initial<00:03:56.750> grinding

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
some give that it that initial grinding

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.880 
some give that it that initial grinding
with<00:03:57.319> something<00:03:57.680> rough<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.310> something<00:03:59.890> you

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
with something rough and something you

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:02.830 
with something rough and something you
know<00:04:01.010> something<00:04:01.250> with<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.549> power<00:04:01.819> tool<00:04:02.090> so<00:04:02.750> you

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
know something with a power tool so you

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.690 
know something with a power tool so you
don't<00:04:02.959> have<00:04:03.019> to<00:04:03.140> do<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.260> lot<00:04:03.560> of<00:04:03.590> work<00:04:03.860> this<00:04:04.519> will

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
don't have to do a lot of work this will

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.490 
don't have to do a lot of work this will
be<00:04:04.790> kind<00:04:05.060> of<00:04:05.150> tricky<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.599> belly<00:04:05.900> will<00:04:06.170> be<00:04:06.290> easy

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
be kind of tricky the belly will be easy

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.339 
be kind of tricky the belly will be easy
to<00:04:06.590> sharpen<00:04:07.599> cuz<00:04:08.599> I<00:04:08.629> can<00:04:08.780> just<00:04:08.930> kind<00:04:09.079> of<00:04:09.140> work

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:09.349 
to sharpen cuz I can just kind of work

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:13.479 
to sharpen cuz I can just kind of work
my<00:04:09.530> way<00:04:09.560> through<00:04:10.040> that<00:04:10.159> like<00:04:10.609> this<00:04:12.099> this<00:04:13.099> part

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
my way through that like this this part

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.099 
my way through that like this this part
will<00:04:13.640> be<00:04:13.730> kind<00:04:13.909> of<00:04:14.000> tough<00:04:14.209> because<00:04:14.450> it's<00:04:14.900> kind

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
will be kind of tough because it's kind

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.529 
will be kind of tough because it's kind
of<00:04:15.170> close<00:04:15.470> to<00:04:15.709> the<00:04:15.739> handle<00:04:16.250> and<00:04:16.489> it's<00:04:16.789> got<00:04:17.000> this

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:19.539 

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:23.200 

concave<00:04:20.539> shape<00:04:20.709> where<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:23.000> know<00:04:23.090> you're

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
concave shape where you know you're

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.060 
concave shape where you know you're
gonna<00:04:23.300> have<00:04:23.389> to<00:04:23.600> be<00:04:23.720> a<00:04:23.750> little<00:04:23.960> bit<00:04:24.229> more

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
gonna have to be a little bit more

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.580 
gonna have to be a little bit more
careful<00:04:25.580> because<00:04:25.880> these<00:04:26.270> stones<00:04:26.630> are<00:04:26.870> so<00:04:26.930> wide

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:27.590 
careful because these stones are so wide

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.050 
careful because these stones are so wide
and<00:04:27.889> flat<00:04:28.250> that<00:04:28.960> it's<00:04:29.960> gonna<00:04:30.110> be<00:04:30.320> hard<00:04:30.740> to<00:04:31.060> get

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
and flat that it's gonna be hard to get

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.090 
and flat that it's gonna be hard to get
every<00:04:32.449> edge<00:04:32.720> of<00:04:33.260> the<00:04:34.130> concave<00:04:34.729> blade<00:04:35.210> shape

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
every edge of the concave blade shape

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.439 
every edge of the concave blade shape
sharpened<00:04:37.100> so<00:04:37.280> we'll<00:04:37.639> see<00:04:37.789> how<00:04:37.910> I<00:04:37.940> do<00:04:38.090> I<00:04:38.210> might

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:38.449 
sharpened so we'll see how I do I might

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:39.580 
sharpened so we'll see how I do I might
have<00:04:38.539> to<00:04:38.600> go<00:04:38.720> back<00:04:38.750> in<00:04:39.050> there<00:04:39.139> with<00:04:39.229> something

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:39.590 
have to go back in there with something

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:42.279 
have to go back in there with something
smaller<00:04:40.010> and<00:04:40.400> fix<00:04:40.669> that<00:04:40.880> up<00:04:41.050> but<00:04:42.050> I'm<00:04:42.169> gonna

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
smaller and fix that up but I'm gonna

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:46.420 
smaller and fix that up but I'm gonna
initially<00:04:42.650> just<00:04:43.130> grind<00:04:43.840> the<00:04:44.840> con<00:04:45.440> the<00:04:46.190> non

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
initially just grind the con the non

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.430 
initially just grind the con the non
concave<00:04:46.820> edge<00:04:47.360> of<00:04:47.570> the<00:04:47.660> blade<00:04:47.780> the<00:04:47.930> belly<00:04:48.199> of

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
concave edge of the blade the belly of

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.870 
concave edge of the blade the belly of
the<00:04:48.530> blade<00:04:48.740> which<00:04:49.010> we'll<00:04:49.160> start<00:04:49.520> from<00:04:49.669> right

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:49.880 
the blade which we'll start from right

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.689 
the blade which we'll start from right
here<00:04:50.300> all<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:51.650> way<00:04:51.740> to<00:04:51.770> the<00:04:51.979> tip<00:04:54.430> and<00:04:55.430> I'll<00:04:55.550> do

00:04:55.689 --> 00:04:55.699 
here all the way to the tip and I'll do

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.629 
here all the way to the tip and I'll do
that<00:04:56.770> but<00:04:57.770> before<00:04:57.919> I<00:04:58.099> do<00:04:58.190> that<00:04:58.280> let<00:04:58.550> me<00:04:58.580> just

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
that but before I do that let me just

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.820 
that but before I do that let me just
show<00:04:58.940> you<00:04:58.970> the<00:04:59.810> technique<00:05:00.320> that<00:05:00.349> I'm<00:05:00.590> gonna<00:05:00.680> be

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
show you the technique that I'm gonna be

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:04.000 
show you the technique that I'm gonna be
using<00:05:01.750> I'm<00:05:02.750> not<00:05:02.900> actually<00:05:03.080> gonna<00:05:03.380> sharpen<00:05:03.710> yet

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:04.010 
using I'm not actually gonna sharpen yet
