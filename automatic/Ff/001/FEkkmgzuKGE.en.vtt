00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
but what can you expect with a setup

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:21.870 
but what can you expect with a setup
like<00:05:17.979> this<00:05:18.190> on<00:05:18.550> a<00:05:18.580> map<00:05:18.820> like<00:05:19.030> this<00:05:20.880> hopefully

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
like this on a map like this hopefully

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.120 
like this on a map like this hopefully
uh<00:05:22.120> we<00:05:22.630> don't<00:05:22.720> get<00:05:22.900> bad<00:05:23.260> timing<00:05:23.590> here<00:05:23.919> luckily

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
uh we don't get bad timing here luckily

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:31.370 
uh we don't get bad timing here luckily
I<00:05:24.280> saw<00:05:24.490> his<00:05:24.610> barrel<00:05:24.940> popper<00:05:25.270> on<00:05:25.300> that<00:05:25.539> corner

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.290 

I'm<00:05:31.920> gonna<00:05:32.100> keep<00:05:32.370> trying<00:05:32.700> to<00:05:32.760> cut<00:05:32.880> this<00:05:33.030> laying

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
I'm gonna keep trying to cut this laying

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.650 
I'm gonna keep trying to cut this laying
off<00:05:33.480> the<00:05:34.230> best<00:05:34.440> way<00:05:34.620> to<00:05:34.680> play<00:05:34.950> with<00:05:35.160> this<00:05:35.280> gun

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
off the best way to play with this gun

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:40.490 
off the best way to play with this gun
cut<00:05:36.660> off<00:05:36.810> lanes<00:05:37.110> cut<00:05:37.410> off<00:05:37.530> lanes<00:05:37.880> that<00:05:39.290> he<00:05:40.290> may

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
cut off lanes cut off lanes that he may

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.260 
cut off lanes cut off lanes that he may
got<00:05:40.740> him<00:05:40.770> I<00:05:41.190> think<00:05:41.250> we've<00:05:41.520> probably<00:05:41.700> flipped

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 
got him I think we've probably flipped

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:45.110 
got him I think we've probably flipped
their<00:05:42.450> spawns<00:05:42.780> but<00:05:43.200> a<00:05:43.580> little<00:05:44.580> worried<00:05:44.910> about

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
their spawns but a little worried about

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.940 
their spawns but a little worried about
maybe<00:05:45.420> some<00:05:45.660> residual<00:05:46.170> guys<00:05:46.440> that<00:05:46.770> had

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
maybe some residual guys that had

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.490 
maybe some residual guys that had
already<00:05:47.190> spawned<00:05:47.760> before<00:05:48.150> it<00:05:48.270> flipped<00:05:48.600> and<00:05:49.380> I

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.500 
already spawned before it flipped and I

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:50.900 
already spawned before it flipped and I
don't<00:05:49.680> have<00:05:49.800> focus<00:05:50.070> on<00:05:50.190> this<00:05:50.280> class<00:05:50.490> that's

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:50.910 
don't have focus on this class that's

00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:52.730 
don't have focus on this class that's
that<00:05:51.720> definitely<00:05:52.110> would<00:05:52.290> have<00:05:52.320> kept<00:05:52.560> me<00:05:52.650> alive

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
that definitely would have kept me alive

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.170 
that definitely would have kept me alive
in<00:05:52.980> that<00:05:53.070> situation<00:05:53.340> it<00:05:53.670> would<00:05:53.790> have<00:05:53.880> earned

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
in that situation it would have earned

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.900 
in that situation it would have earned
me<00:05:54.330> that<00:05:54.480> kill<00:05:55.250> that's<00:05:56.250> why<00:05:56.400> I<00:05:56.430> highly

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:56.910 
me that kill that's why I highly

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:59.570 
me that kill that's why I highly
recommend<00:05:57.030> using<00:05:57.660> focus<00:05:58.170> holy<00:05:59.040> crap<00:05:59.310> the<00:05:59.430> guy

00:05:59.570 --> 00:05:59.580 
recommend using focus holy crap the guy

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:01.790 
recommend using focus holy crap the guy
is<00:05:59.640> good<00:05:59.880> aim<00:06:00.060> or<00:06:00.240> something<00:06:00.750> I<00:06:00.930> wasn't<00:06:01.500> even<00:06:01.740> a

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
is good aim or something I wasn't even a

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:07.970 
is good aim or something I wasn't even a
headshot<00:06:02.130> I<00:06:02.160> just<00:06:02.460> died<00:06:02.610> instantly<00:06:03.320> well<00:06:06.980> one

thing<00:06:08.130> with<00:06:08.250> this<00:06:08.340> map<00:06:08.550> you<00:06:08.910> really<00:06:09.450> have<00:06:09.540> to

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
thing with this map you really have to

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.300 
thing with this map you really have to
be<00:06:09.750> aware<00:06:10.020> right<00:06:10.350> from<00:06:10.590> spawn<00:06:10.890> you<00:06:11.040> have<00:06:11.130> to<00:06:11.190> be

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310 
be aware right from spawn you have to be

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.990 
be aware right from spawn you have to be
ready<00:06:11.520> for<00:06:11.640> enemies<00:06:12.090> ready<00:06:12.450> for<00:06:12.660> gunfights<00:06:14.000> I

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
ready for enemies ready for gunfights I

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.550 
ready for enemies ready for gunfights I
thought<00:06:15.540> I<00:06:15.600> would<00:06:15.720> have<00:06:15.870> time<00:06:16.080> to<00:06:16.110> push<00:06:16.380> up

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
thought I would have time to push up

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.390 
thought I would have time to push up
there<00:06:16.710> it<00:06:16.800> didn't<00:06:17.010> realize<00:06:17.280> they<00:06:17.370> were

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
there it didn't realize they were

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.490 
there it didn't realize they were
pushing<00:06:17.700> so<00:06:17.820> aggressively<00:06:18.270> I<00:06:18.570> knew<00:06:19.170> my<00:06:19.290> side

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500 
pushing so aggressively I knew my side

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.440 
pushing so aggressively I knew my side
was<00:06:19.650> open<00:06:19.830> though<00:06:20.070> could<00:06:20.880> have<00:06:21.060> played<00:06:21.300> that

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
was open though could have played that

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:25.610 
was open though could have played that
much<00:06:21.600> better<00:06:21.900> come<00:06:22.350> on<00:06:22.590> come<00:06:23.250> on<00:06:24.350> I'm<00:06:25.350> not

much better come on come on I'm not
going<00:06:25.740> to<00:06:25.800> waste<00:06:25.890> the<00:06:26.070> time<00:06:26.190> picking<00:06:26.430> up<00:06:26.580> the

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
going to waste the time picking up the

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.100 
going to waste the time picking up the
ballistic<00:06:27.060> vests<00:06:27.240> it<00:06:27.450> just<00:06:27.690> takes<00:06:27.840> way<00:06:28.080> too

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
ballistic vests it just takes way too

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.410 
ballistic vests it just takes way too
long<00:06:28.290> and<00:06:28.680> it's<00:06:29.520> not<00:06:29.700> really<00:06:29.880> worth<00:06:30.150> it<00:06:30.330> it

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
long and it's not really worth it it

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:34.310 
long and it's not really worth it it
might<00:06:30.660> save<00:06:30.930> my<00:06:31.110> life<00:06:31.260> once<00:06:31.320> might<00:06:32.040> not<00:06:33.320> I'm
