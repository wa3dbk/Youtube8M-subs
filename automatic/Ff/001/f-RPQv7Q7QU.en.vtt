00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.140 

this<00:00:21.600> is<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.800> island<00:00:23.220> in<00:00:23.430> our<00:00:23.550> kitchen<00:00:23.910> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
this is the island in our kitchen and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.839 
this is the island in our kitchen and
I've<00:00:24.779> laid<00:00:24.990> out<00:00:26.090> fabric<00:00:27.259> the<00:00:28.259> length<00:00:28.500> of<00:00:28.680> it

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
I've laid out fabric the length of it

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.519 
I've laid out fabric the length of it
I'm<00:00:29.849> not<00:00:30.150> sure<00:00:30.210> if<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.750> camera<00:00:31.050> will<00:00:31.320> pick<00:00:31.470> it

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
I'm not sure if this camera will pick it

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.979 
I'm not sure if this camera will pick it
up<00:00:31.680> any<00:00:31.829> better<00:00:31.890> yes<00:00:32.369> it<00:00:32.610> will<00:00:32.820> you<00:00:33.600> can<00:00:33.780> see

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
up any better yes it will you can see

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.259 
up any better yes it will you can see
the<00:00:34.260> little<00:00:35.300> fibers<00:00:36.300> photo<00:00:36.720> natural<00:00:37.470> fibers

00:00:38.259 --> 00:00:38.269 
the little fibers photo natural fibers

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:41.030 
the little fibers photo natural fibers
that<00:00:39.269> is<00:00:39.540> probably<00:00:40.050> why<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.320> picked<00:00:40.890> this

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
that is probably why I picked this

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.170 
that is probably why I picked this
instead<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.699> the<00:00:41.850> UM<00:00:42.530> the<00:00:43.530> bleached<00:00:44.180> it's

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
instead of the UM the bleached it's

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.960 
instead of the UM the bleached it's
because<00:00:45.830> this<00:00:46.830> just<00:00:47.010> has<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.460> character<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
because this just has more character to

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.380 
because this just has more character to
it

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
it

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.009 
it
and<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.140> $1<00:00:49.440> per<00:00:49.860> yard<00:00:50.040> cheaper<00:00:50.640> I

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:51.019 
and it was $1 per yard cheaper I

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.380 
and it was $1 per yard cheaper I
absolutely<00:00:52.019> love<00:00:52.530> little<00:00:53.339> specs<00:00:53.640> like<00:00:53.879> that

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
absolutely love little specs like that

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.119 
absolutely love little specs like that
I<00:00:55.129> mean<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.460> not<00:00:56.640> gonna<00:00:57.030> be<00:00:57.269> like<00:00:58.129> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
I mean it's not gonna be like the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.770 
I mean it's not gonna be like the
finished<00:00:59.489> product<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.180> don't<00:01:00.360> think<00:01:00.540> I<00:01:00.629> would

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
finished product I don't think I would

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.160 
finished product I don't think I would
ever<00:01:00.809> sell<00:01:01.260> anything<00:01:02.360> made<00:01:03.360> of<00:01:03.600> muslin<00:01:04.140> I

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
might I don't know but it is definitely

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.289

cost-effective<00:01:11.130> for<00:01:11.340> practice<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.030> trial

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
this dress I have strongly considered

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.180 
this dress I have strongly considered
this<00:01:52.979> black<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.960> if<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.110> will<00:01:55.290> zoom<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.800> it<00:01:55.830> for

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
this black one if it will zoom on it for

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.730 
this black one if it will zoom on it for
me<00:01:56.930> that<00:01:57.930> works<00:01:58.170> but<00:01:58.650> I<00:01:59.690> like<00:02:00.690> this<00:02:01.050> one<00:02:01.110> if<00:02:01.560> you

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
me that works but I like this one if you

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.990 
me that works but I like this one if you
can<00:02:01.770> see<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.340> has<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.979> lay<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.100> down<00:02:05.130> it<00:02:05.970> has

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
can see it has the lay it down it has

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.369 
can see it has the lay it down it has
the<00:02:07.039> detail<00:02:08.039> at<00:02:08.159> the<00:02:08.250> waist<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:09.019> it's<00:02:10.019> shorter

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
the detail at the waist and it's shorter

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.589 
the detail at the waist and it's shorter
so<00:02:11.129> I<00:02:11.519> think<00:02:11.580> that<00:02:11.819> it's<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.060> cuter<00:02:12.360> dress

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
so I think that it's a cuter dress

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.890 
so I think that it's a cuter dress
overall<00:02:13.819> I'm<00:02:14.819> not<00:02:15.060> gonna<00:02:15.180> start<00:02:15.510> it<00:02:15.599> right<00:02:15.750> now

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
overall I'm not gonna start it right now

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.780 
overall I'm not gonna start it right now
but<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.170> might<00:02:16.470> also<00:02:16.650> be<00:02:16.950> making<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> Cape<00:02:17.610> to

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
but I might also be making the Cape to

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.589 
but I might also be making the Cape to
go<00:02:17.909> with<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.950> think<00:02:20.459> it's<00:02:20.610> cute<00:02:20.879> I'm<00:02:21.390> not

00:02:21.589 --> 00:02:21.599

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
sure how it'll look all one color but

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.800 
sure how it'll look all one color but
you<00:02:25.470> know<00:02:25.650> that's<00:02:26.640> why<00:02:26.970> it's<00:02:27.120> just<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.450> practice

36<00:02:53.070> and<00:02:53.870> that<00:02:54.870> is<00:02:55.110> actually<00:02:55.980> very<00:02:56.430> very

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
36 and that is actually very very

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:04.040

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340

and<00:03:08.670> has<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:08.940> size<00:03:09.240> 4<00:03:10.160> ok<00:03:11.160> so<00:03:11.489> this<00:03:11.910> is<00:03:12.120> my<00:03:12.300> book

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010

it's<00:03:14.010> not<00:03:14.070> wanting<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.489> lay<00:03:14.670> flat<00:03:14.910> so<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.180> put

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
it's not wanting to lay flat so I put

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.890 
it's not wanting to lay flat so I put

understood how they come up with their

understood how they come up with their
sizing<00:04:31.290> I'm<00:04:31.640> guessing<00:04:32.640> it's<00:04:32.880> just<00:04:32.970> from<00:04:33.600> a

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:33.810 
sizing I'm guessing it's just from a

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.170 
sizing I'm guessing it's just from a
long<00:04:34.110> long<00:04:34.830> time<00:04:35.190> ago<00:04:35.490> and<00:04:35.729> they<00:04:35.850> just<00:04:36.000> don't

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
long long time ago and they just don't

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.390 
long long time ago and they just don't
change<00:04:36.660> it

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 
change it

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.559 
change it

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:34.340 
other patterns that i'm thinking about

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:39.100

doing<00:05:34.520> with<00:05:35.090> this<00:05:36.130> with<00:05:37.130> the<00:05:37.310> muslin<00:05:37.729> is<00:05:38.150> this

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:39.110 
doing with this with the muslin is this

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:41.710 
doing with this with the muslin is this
pattern<00:05:39.380> it's<00:05:40.250> to<00:05:40.370> learn<00:05:40.550> to<00:05:40.699> sew<00:05:40.940> pattern<00:05:41.419> and

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
pattern it's to learn to sew pattern and

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.110 
pattern it's to learn to sew pattern and
I<00:05:41.810> feel<00:05:42.169> kind<00:05:42.500> of<00:05:42.590> weird<00:05:42.770> for<00:05:43.130> using<00:05:43.430> it<00:05:43.580> but<00:05:43.880> I

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120

do<00:05:44.240> like<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:44.780> skirts<00:05:45.080> and<00:05:45.470> I'm<00:05:45.800> probably

00:05:46.029 --> 00:05:46.039 
do like the skirts and I'm probably

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.070
