00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.540
 to the crater 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.700
 all friends and hello it really 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.710
 after a due program right I am the author 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.139
 and the host of victor trajan we start friends 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.509
 from what is actually not 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.640
 maybe with that cotos which cannot 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.480
 jump off the entire car Internet 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.890
 Can or can not DPS officer 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.170
 take pictures of us with you or take pictures 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.240
 on a video camera is equal to whether we have the right 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.340
 we do this when we face 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.640
 Inspector DPS friends and looking ahead 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.700
 I will say right away, and we and the DPS officer 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.809
 do in the rules if we take a look 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.940
 administrative regulations of the interior Ministry by the way 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.160
 saying so many mistakenly looks in 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.170
 his old wording and not find there 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.640
 the situation is that the police officer does not 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.350
 only employee Goiania employee 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.270
 the police are generally entitled 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.950
 photograph the driver on a personal 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.640
 camera or take on a personal 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.800
 video camera but the amount that it does not 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.840
 under the abundant poste of these swim 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.180
 for the tautology and the unforced can 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.940
 take cash photo machine but 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.159
 Naturally my friends, we also have 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.689
 legal right to do the same not 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.280
 intruding on spectrum privacy 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.020
 actually what is the personal life of the inspector 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.689
 maybe you have on performance 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.100
 and the police officer is not given 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.290
 right is the same administrative 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.540
 regulations to prevent 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.880
 audio and video shooting arises from you 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.790
 valuable question why loans sometimes not 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.040
 take such records the courts should 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.710
 accept and record made by inspector 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.570
 DPS if he filmed you and made a record 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.670
 by you if you filmed the DPS inspectors 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.930
 because the court basically cannot 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.750
 deny the petition 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.939
 accepting such a record is another thing that 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.640
 the court evaluating this record can say that 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.439
 so nothing follows from it 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.149
 nothing disproves and nothing 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.670
 confirmed to be evidence 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.740
 the case is therefore not yours again 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.229
 legal right to require admission to 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.049
 case materials such as videos already 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.509
 court right to answer you honestly and by 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.460
 masculine worthy to attach the case 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.290
 evaluate her as evidence or she 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.290
 this is not worthy 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.800
 radio
