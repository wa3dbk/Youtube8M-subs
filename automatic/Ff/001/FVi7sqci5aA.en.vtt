cover you always want to go button side

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.589 
cover you always want to go button side
first<00:02:08.039> now<00:02:08.520> because<00:02:08.849> i<00:02:08.879> have<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.119> screen<00:02:09.420> shield

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
first now because i have a screen shield

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.930 
first now because i have a screen shield
on<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:09.929> front<00:02:10.259> and<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.500> back<00:02:10.890> I<00:02:11.459> don't<00:02:11.790> think

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
on the front and the back I don't think

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.250 
on the front and the back I don't think
the<00:02:12.030> front<00:02:12.270> one<00:02:12.420> affects<00:02:12.720> it<00:02:12.900> but<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.110> back

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the front one affects it but the back

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.620 
the front one affects it but the back
one

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
one

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:14.910 
one
might<00:02:13.720> make<00:02:13.930> it<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.170> little<00:02:14.200> bit<00:02:14.590> harder<00:02:14.890> to

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
might make it a little bit harder to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.280 
might make it a little bit harder to
install<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.700> kind<00:02:16.270> of<00:02:16.360> have<00:02:16.540> found<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.110> as

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
install I kind of have found that as

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.530 
install I kind of have found that as
I've<00:02:17.740> taken<00:02:18.010> it<00:02:18.190> on<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.520> off<00:02:18.550> you<00:02:19.120> know<00:02:19.240> more

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
I've taken it on and off you know more

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.710 
I've taken it on and off you know more
often<00:02:19.990> it<00:02:20.290> has<00:02:20.500> become<00:02:20.740> easier<00:02:21.340> to<00:02:21.640> put<00:02:22.240> on<00:02:22.390> and

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
often it has become easier to put on and

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.750 
often it has become easier to put on and
take<00:02:22.810> off<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.620> maybe<00:02:23.830> it's<00:02:24.010> becoming<00:02:24.280> loose<00:02:24.550> or

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
take off so maybe it's becoming loose or

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.790 
take off so maybe it's becoming loose or
overtime<00:02:25.240> which<00:02:25.480> is<00:02:25.600> a<00:02:25.630> good<00:02:25.840> thing<00:02:25.900> it<00:02:26.440> still

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
overtime which is a good thing it still

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.500 
overtime which is a good thing it still
though<00:02:26.950> maintains<00:02:27.370> a<00:02:27.520> really<00:02:27.700> good<00:02:27.880> fit<00:02:28.120> you

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
though maintains a really good fit you

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.750 
though maintains a really good fit you
can<00:02:28.660> see<00:02:28.840> it<00:02:28.930> just<00:02:28.960> clicks<00:02:29.440> into<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:30.070> kind<00:02:30.670> of

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
can see it just clicks into the kind of

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.490 
can see it just clicks into the kind of
the<00:02:30.850> bezel<00:02:31.240> comes<00:02:31.540> right<00:02:31.750> up<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.230> edge<00:02:32.350> of

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
the bezel comes right up to the edge of

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.080 
the bezel comes right up to the edge of
the<00:02:32.560> glass<00:02:32.800> so<00:02:33.400> you<00:02:33.460> don't<00:02:33.610> really<00:02:33.700> get<00:02:33.880> any

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
the glass so you don't really get any

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.730 
the glass so you don't really get any
lay<00:02:34.300> on<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.570> table<00:02:34.600> design<00:02:35.170> with<00:02:35.320> this<00:02:35.500> but

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
lay on the table design with this but

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.530 
lay on the table design with this but
that's<00:02:35.950> true<00:02:36.130> of<00:02:36.220> most<00:02:36.460> snap-on<00:02:36.790> back<00:02:37.150> covers

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
that's true of most snap-on back covers

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.440 
that's true of most snap-on back covers
and<00:02:37.750> again<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.740> bottom<00:02:39.280> is<00:02:39.430> fully<00:02:39.730> open<00:02:39.850> as

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
and again the bottom is fully open as

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.080 
and again the bottom is fully open as
well<00:02:40.720> as<00:02:40.930> the<00:02:41.230> top<00:02:41.560> when<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.220> comes<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.610> docking

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
well as the top when it comes to docking

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.460 
well as the top when it comes to docking
this<00:02:43.270> because<00:02:43.510> you<00:02:43.600> can<00:02:43.750> see<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:43.990> does<00:02:44.170> stick

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
this because you can see it does stick

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.380 
this because you can see it does stick
out<00:02:44.590> the<00:02:44.800> bottom<00:02:45.130> I<00:02:45.280> was<00:02:45.700> still<00:02:45.910> actually<00:02:46.090> able

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
out the bottom I was still actually able

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.880 
out the bottom I was still actually able
to<00:02:46.600> dock<00:02:46.810> this<00:02:47.020> in<00:02:47.260> all<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.530> my<00:02:47.680> doc

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
to dock this in all of my doc

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.070 
to dock this in all of my doc
accessories<00:02:48.550> I<00:02:48.730> just<00:02:49.150> had<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.330> remove<00:02:49.720> the

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
accessories I just had to remove the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.110 
accessories I just had to remove the
dock<00:02:50.260> adapter<00:02:50.470> in<00:02:51.010> order<00:02:51.280> to<00:02:51.370> do<00:02:51.520> so<00:02:51.550> and<00:02:51.970> then

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
dock adapter in order to do so and then

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.850 
dock adapter in order to do so and then
it<00:02:52.210> was<00:02:52.330> no<00:02:52.510> problem<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.500> where<00:02:53.710> this

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
it was no problem so where this

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.490 
it was no problem so where this
obviously<00:02:54.280> really<00:02:54.550> shines<00:02:54.940> is<00:02:55.330> the<00:02:55.720> back<00:02:55.960> you

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
obviously really shines is the back you

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.140 
obviously really shines is the back you
can<00:02:56.560> see<00:02:56.710> it<00:02:56.980> features<00:02:57.340> like<00:02:57.520> a<00:02:57.550> pebbled

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
can see it features like a pebbled

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.570 
can see it features like a pebbled
leather<00:02:58.210> texture<00:02:58.990> at<00:02:59.530> the<00:02:59.770> bottom<00:03:00.160> portion

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
leather texture at the bottom portion

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.120 
leather texture at the bottom portion

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.110 
correct version the 1i have they decided
to<00:03:13.720> make<00:03:13.840> it<00:03:13.990> more<00:03:14.200> hidden<00:03:15.190> and<00:03:15.520> more<00:03:15.730> embossed

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120
