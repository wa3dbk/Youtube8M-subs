so next we bridge the gap between

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.340 
so next we bridge the gap between
skincare<00:01:05.059> and<00:01:05.239> makeup<00:01:05.360> by<00:01:05.720> using<00:01:05.930> a<00:01:06.140> primer

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350

again has an anti-aging effect so it

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:17.230

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
the sponge and tapping onto the skin

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:40.570 
the sponge and tapping onto the skin
builds<00:01:38.570> the<00:01:38.690> coverage<00:01:39.110> was<00:01:39.710> maintaining<00:01:40.370> the

builds the coverage was maintaining the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.730 
builds the coverage was maintaining the
globe<00:01:40.820> then<00:01:41.420> using<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.900> smaller<00:01:42.200> side<00:01:42.500> of<00:01:42.650> the

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.030 
globe then using the smaller side of the
sponge<00:01:42.980> and<00:01:43.340> roll<00:01:43.940> it<00:01:44.150> through<00:01:44.480> the<00:01:44.630> t-zone
