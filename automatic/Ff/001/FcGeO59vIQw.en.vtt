00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello very good everyone good makes a 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.750
 couple of days I told you we could 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.760
 have microtransactions in grand theft 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.179
 auto 'online and good roster has it 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.849
 confirmed and same is true today good 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.859
 is already confirmed and we already know that 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.080
 let's have these views of the vehicle 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.699
 transactions and when this topic is going to go 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.260
 for cards there will be four types of 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.869
 different cards for example 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.570
 we will have the red shark that good 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.670
 in the game they will give us one hundred thousand dollars and 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.920
 we will have to pay about three 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.360
 euros then we have the tiger shark 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:39.030
 that would be worth 2 who good not in the game 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.700
 they give us 200,000 credits and we 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.340
 we will have to pay five euros in the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.320
 prices in euros approximately then 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.250
 we would have the blue shark that 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:52.949
 they give us 500 thousand dollars and we 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.489
 we pay ten euros and then we have great 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:01:00.449
 white shark that give us a million 250 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.699
 thousand dollars and we paid about 16 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.280
 euros approximately good to me this 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.690
 I honestly do not care about it 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.510
 people who do not like 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:11.280
 missions does not like more to play free or 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.170
 get things faster than 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.450
 others so good for those who are 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:18.060
 want to spend money is the things 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.090
 before it is not a bad idea that truth 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.980
 and to each one if his choice is either 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.110
 bothers nobody and I do not think I'm going to give 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:28.650
 problems in the game this but good 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.390
 with an idea in truth and then have 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.390
 commented also some other 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.400
 What a good thing we can do 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.400
 This online mode when you already have 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.320
 seen but well you know it consists of 16 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.390
 Online players are not going to be able 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.570
 have more as we said to the best 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.820
 we could have 32 but for example what 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.320
 first we're going to do day 1 of 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.890
 October when we have the game and 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.270
 Let's play grand theft auto 'online 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.680
 we will have to create is not a character 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.840
 using it we will get to create 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.600
 us but we will not be able to create a 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.680
 woman a man like us we want 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.140
 but well, each character has his 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.479
 unique customization so we're going to 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.390
 customize in our own way and then 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.190
 apart when when playing 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.590
 freely we will be able to change the 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.769
 clothes put tattoos 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.200
 with the hairstyle as in the way as in 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.670
 the individual mode then the same then 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.069
 we will also have reputation points 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.810
 that will be obtained by doing missions you 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.599
 The more missions you make more points 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.050
 you are accumulating and these points good is 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:32.960
 as the rank as 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:35.240
 as well as a range that puts you without knowing 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:38.780
 the experience you have for each thing 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:42.140
 and this I suppose we go then also 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.840
 we have the 500 missions that will leave 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.270
 supposedly updating and we will go 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.190
 putting more and good these missions already 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.020
 you know we're going to have it 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.120
 to complete both solo and 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.340
 with other players with friends or 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.930
 as we want then we can also 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.209
 do the same activities in the way 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.640
 individual in the online mode or the 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:05.989
 marathon races we can play at 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:09.650
 tennis to golf jump by parachute and 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.060
 good do these these activities 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:16.040
 we will be able to make them with others 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:17.420
 players with your friends we go that no longer 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.250
 you know in an individual way by the 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.140
 you do only now here, then you can 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.600
 do with people of the world with your friends 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.700
 and these things that are more true and 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.010
 then they have given details that the 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.350
 properties in online mode are going to be 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.150
 cheaper than in story mode but the 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.100
 problem is that cars and weapons 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.920
 will be more expensive than multiplayer or 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.350
 it is everything upside down in more properties 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.560
 cheap and more expensive cars and weapons in the 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:43.880
 remember and good multiplayer 

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.060
 nothing I hope you liked the 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.130
 information 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:51.290
