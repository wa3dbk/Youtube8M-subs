 let's proceed we talk quickly 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.730
 so as not to take away much of your time 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.770
 we open from this side 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:22.990
 we will have to wait for the 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.140
 box and let's remove from here in the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.150
 part of here behind a little ones a 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.920
 little tape and we are going to remove this 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.720
 part of the box that currently does not 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.600
 is going to serve us, let's put a 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.630
 side and here we have what is the box 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.810
 of the burden we are going to remove this part of 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.910
 here to be able to release what is the 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.100
 part of protective plastic that brings 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:48.460
 in the upper part 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:51.350
 if we can have our our gopro 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.240
 let's remove it 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.270
 the one who studies law to the chicago where 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.430
 him in the previous video obviously and 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.200
 Now possibly I'm going to show you what 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.290
 what is the camera are we going to affect the 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.540
 we put it here to the side and go 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.189
 to open this part of here to be able 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.000
 see what it brings inside of 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.890
 I 'll show you how they can 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.060
 see here back what it is and at the beginning 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.569
 fast what are some stickers and a 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.239
 user manual 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.040
 here comes all this we put it to a 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.280
 side of this side brings us information 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.659
 of security and guarantee and we are going to open 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.800
 the box to see what it is that we 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.290
 includes inside 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.300
 we are going to take everything out and well we put a 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.510
 side the box and it will serve us 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.740
 moment we have another frame to protect 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.960
 so that this is good this we can 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:43.790
 change to our case to be able to have 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.100
 access to the screen and better quality of 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.960
 audio this frames for the same to be able to 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.130
 pass audio but this one is discovered 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.310
 in the part of the screen 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:55.030
 We have two bases to be able to paste them in 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.230
 any surface and different 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.290
 adapters to be able to place them in 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.670
 these bases in addition to having what is 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:06.530
 a battery and a usb to mini charger 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.320

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:15.110
 I own this model fort silver and 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.450
 here we have lake next form in the 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.450

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.580
 of this is in the back already here 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.250
 we have a touch screen on the part of 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.800
 the silver and the lake pro black we do not have 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.140
 this touch screen we sacrifice in the 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.120
 silver what is the quality in 4k 30 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.460
