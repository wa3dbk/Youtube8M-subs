00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:02.030
 Unfortunately 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.750
 for a bit the nice weather video in the parking lot horribly 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.760
 differences 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.760
 for my sense of what you are curious about developments 

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:13.359
 axes have been needed 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:15.379
 lawyer Willem Alexander 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:18.310
 so it's the biggest nonsense 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:19.110
 7 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:20.890
 especially too 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.640
 it is in morocco 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.339
 the man told 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.230
 against sporting yeon long 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.429
 to do 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.419
 hilversum 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.660
 the majority 36 people 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.000
 throw a raffle there 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.940
 in these times for traffic is also not 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.010
 the woman but also police station 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.010
 arrested men 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.940
 published the newspaper 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.830
 so you must be 

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.740
 the team management also believe 

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.210
 all preventable 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.180
 large areas 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.590
 at half time it was maybe 0 2 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.360
 outside in nature 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 this is a win 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.590
 week earlier 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.190
 I have myself 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.810
 House of Representatives 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.810
 the driver 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.600
 that's necessary 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.290
 where possible find something among the residents for the north of north holland 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.290
 is possible 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.230
 so don't moan now 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.760
 click here 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.280
 easy sat so a fire started 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.280
 you're getting them 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.700
 7 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.830
 to hear the music 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:04.830
 how is it possible that is not so anyway 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:13.529
 the oil will be in the summer for the fire an average euro in the plus 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.329
 something to report 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.329
 domain lommel 

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:24.259
 become a nomenclature 

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:27.259
 that deadly 

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:39.979
 now is the engine compartment 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:52.989
 just pay quietly
