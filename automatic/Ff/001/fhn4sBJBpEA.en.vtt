now I am using a soft acrylic gel medium
I'm<00:00:30.980> using<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:32.119> gloss<00:00:32.620> gloss<00:00:33.620> gel<00:00:34.010> because<00:00:34.250> it

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
I'm using the gloss gloss gel because it

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.190 
I'm using the gloss gloss gel because it
dries<00:00:34.670> to<00:00:34.700> a<00:00:34.910> greater<00:00:35.210> clarity<00:00:35.690> than<00:00:35.960> matte

dries to a greater clarity than matte

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.010 
dries to a greater clarity than matte
gel<00:00:37.570> you<00:00:38.570> could<00:00:38.840> use<00:00:39.200> a<00:00:39.559> harder<00:00:40.489> gel<00:00:40.790> or<00:00:41.210> tar

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
gel which is a product that golden makes

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:58.940 
gel which is a product that golden makes
but<00:00:44.150> I'm<00:00:44.270> using<00:00:44.480> the<00:00:44.720> soft<00:00:44.960> gel<00:00:45.290> medium<00:00:45.710> gloss

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
and now I'm going to peel this acrylic

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.969 
and now I'm going to peel this acrylic
skin<00:01:12.880> away<00:01:13.720> from<00:01:14.049> the<00:01:14.289> plastic<00:01:14.500> sheet

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979

protector it's dried overnight and I'm

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.249 
protector it's dried overnight and I'm
just<00:01:20.409> finding<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:21.009> edge<00:01:21.780> carefully<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:23.229> that

00:01:23.249 --> 00:01:23.259 
just finding the edge carefully so that

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:32.069 
just finding the edge carefully so that
I<00:01:23.409> don't<00:01:23.500> tear<00:01:24.039> the<00:01:24.880> skin<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:31.509> when<00:01:31.720> I<00:01:31.750> have

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:32.079 
I don't tear the skin and when I have

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:33.870 
I don't tear the skin and when I have
that<00:01:32.110> separated<00:01:33.039> from<00:01:33.340> the<00:01:33.520> sheet<00:01:33.729> protector

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
that separated from the sheet protector

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.289 
that separated from the sheet protector
I<00:01:34.479> have<00:01:35.110> a<00:01:35.350> transparent<00:01:36.280> collage<00:01:37.149> material<00:01:39.299> so

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
I have a transparent collage material so

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.760 
I have a transparent collage material so
now<00:01:40.479> I<00:01:40.509> have<00:01:40.899> this<00:01:41.259> acrylic<00:01:42.000> skin<00:01:43.409> which<00:01:44.409> is

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
now I have this acrylic skin which is

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.809 
now I have this acrylic skin which is
the<00:01:45.479> squeeze<00:01:46.479> bottle<00:01:46.899> paint<00:01:47.250> scribbled<00:01:48.250> onto

00:01:48.809 --> 00:01:48.819 
the squeeze bottle paint scribbled onto

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:51.719 
the squeeze bottle paint scribbled onto
a<00:01:48.850> sheet<00:01:49.090> protector<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.780> then<00:01:50.439> I<00:01:50.709> let<00:01:51.610> that

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:51.729 
a sheet protector and then I let that

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.339 
a sheet protector and then I let that
dry<00:01:52.000> and<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:53.409> applied<00:01:53.920> some<00:01:54.670> clear<00:01:55.360> gel

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
dry and then applied some clear gel

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:59.820 
dry and then applied some clear gel
acrylic<00:01:57.250> gel<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.780> now<00:01:58.990> it<00:01:59.200> sort<00:01:59.380> of<00:01:59.439> functions

00:01:59.820 --> 00:01:59.830 
acrylic gel so now it sort of functions

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.630 
acrylic gel so now it sort of functions
like<00:01:59.890> a<00:02:00.009> piece<00:02:00.250> of<00:02:00.280> collage<00:02:00.729> and<00:02:02.459> I'm<00:02:03.459> just

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
like a piece of collage and I'm just

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:17.809 
like a piece of collage and I'm just
going<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.880> cut<00:02:04.090> it

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.729 

not<00:02:18.360> sure<00:02:18.510> where<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.750> wanted<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.440> piece

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
not sure where I wanted on this piece

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.960 
not sure where I wanted on this piece
but<00:02:20.840> big<00:02:21.840> enough<00:02:22.080> to<00:02:22.290> go<00:02:22.489> over<00:02:23.489> quite<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.760> large

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
but big enough to go over quite a large

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.890 
but big enough to go over quite a large
section<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:25.709> cut<00:02:26.069> it<00:02:26.159> down<00:02:26.190> from<00:02:26.549> there<00:02:26.900> well

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
section and cut it down from there well

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.509 
section and cut it down from there well
I've<00:02:28.200> got<00:02:28.409> the<00:02:28.500> piece<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.920> I<00:02:28.980> want<00:02:29.220> to<00:02:29.370> use

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
I've got the piece that I want to use

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:31.880 
I've got the piece that I want to use
for<00:02:29.549> collage<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.390> by<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:30.959> way<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.349> excess

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
for collage and by the way the excess

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.690 
for collage and by the way the excess
you've<00:02:32.670> cut<00:02:32.940> off<00:02:33.230> don't<00:02:34.230> store<00:02:34.860> it<00:02:34.980> like<00:02:35.190> this

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
you've cut off don't store it like this

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.170 
you've cut off don't store it like this
because<00:02:36.660> it'll<00:02:36.989> stick<00:02:37.470> together<00:02:38.060> store<00:02:39.060> it

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
because it'll stick together store it

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.690 
because it'll stick together store it
flat<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.920> best<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.069> have<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.280> sheet<00:02:41.580> protector

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
flat and best to have a sheet protector

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.979 
flat and best to have a sheet protector
a<00:02:42.390> plastic<00:02:43.049> sheet<00:02:43.200> protector<00:02:43.590> or<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:43.799> piece<00:02:44.099> of

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
a plastic sheet protector or a piece of

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:52.630 
a plastic sheet protector or a piece of
wax<00:02:45.989> paper<00:02:46.140> or<00:02:46.829> parchment<00:02:47.190> in<00:02:47.610> between<00:02:50.450> okay

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
wax paper or parchment in between okay

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.349 
wax paper or parchment in between okay
so<00:02:53.640> then<00:02:53.849> just<00:02:54.090> like<00:02:54.450> other<00:02:55.430> collage<00:02:56.430> material

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
so then just like other collage material

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:00.110 
so then just like other collage material
I'm<00:02:57.510> going<00:02:57.870> to<00:02:58.560> apply<00:02:59.069> it<00:02:59.190> using<00:02:59.730> my<00:02:59.910> matte

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
I'm going to apply it using my matte

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.569 
I'm going to apply it using my matte
medium<00:03:02.900> and<00:03:03.900> I<00:03:04.890> don't<00:03:05.099> think<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.400> matters

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
medium and I don't think it matters

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:09.860 
medium and I don't think it matters
really<00:03:06.180> which<00:03:06.450> way<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:08.040> apply<00:03:08.870> the

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
really which way you apply the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.720 
really which way you apply the
transparency<00:03:10.709> one<00:03:10.950> side<00:03:11.220> of<00:03:11.370> course<00:03:11.519> is<00:03:11.609> going

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
transparency one side of course is going

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.150 
transparency one side of course is going
to<00:03:11.790> have<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.030> texture<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.780> gel<00:03:13.109> the<00:03:14.010> other

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
to have the texture of the gel the other

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.770 
to have the texture of the gel the other
side<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.519> going<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:14.700> be<00:03:14.790> flat<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.329> side<00:03:15.540> that

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
side is going to be flat the side that

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:17.960 
side is going to be flat the side that
was<00:03:16.319> right<00:03:16.560> against<00:03:17.099> the<00:03:17.310> sheet<00:03:17.489> protector

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
was right against the sheet protector

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:19.970 
was right against the sheet protector
and<00:03:18.150> so<00:03:18.209> it's<00:03:19.019> just<00:03:19.079> a<00:03:19.379> choice<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:19.920> think

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
and so it's just a choice I think

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.750 
and so it's just a choice I think
functionally<00:03:22.160> it's<00:03:23.160> not<00:03:23.370> going<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.579> matter

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
functionally it's not going to matter

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.430 
functionally it's not going to matter
but<00:03:24.540> if<00:03:24.690> you<00:03:24.780> want<00:03:25.099> that<00:03:26.099> gel<00:03:26.549> texture<00:03:27.120> on<00:03:27.480> the

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
but if you want that gel texture on the

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.410 
but if you want that gel texture on the
surface<00:03:29.060> then<00:03:30.060> apply<00:03:30.359> it<00:03:30.389> with<00:03:30.660> that<00:03:30.870> side<00:03:31.139> up
