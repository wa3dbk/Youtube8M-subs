00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.699
 Alckim 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.860
 move house 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.350
 adventure adventures 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:08.950
 ef 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.890
 as you can see 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.280
 afterwards designed to work in three 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.640
 09 13 of the launching the Brazilian rocket must remain open 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.720
 When would this cup begin? 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.720
 the mayor will break loose, he will fall on the earth 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.630
 the recovered rocket the course the inep is the second sector will be released itambé 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.060
 technical manager 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.480
 What do I think is going to happen? 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.670
 is that I want to be the sector will fall on the ground 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.670
 when it comes to loulé 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.470
 It would be good to go back to work. 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.790
 brumer 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:01.370
 here I am much more astronaut than expected to soon have two astronauts 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.960
 after having made our commander can not follow 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.550
 How is he going to take the wife to the children? 

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.579
 anyway I do not believe this project because this lack of 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:27.049
 credibility 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:28.289
 if you say that 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:31.289
 everything has been scientifically proven that nothing was 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.849
 who I was 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.849
 I only have those people explained. 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:41.939
 I want to say that I am absolutely certain that he may or may not arrive 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:42.779
 up there 

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:45.649
 me too 

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:48.649
 I'm absolutely sure of that too. 

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:52.789
 but not with your rocket 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.639
 be low in sugar 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:59.119
 Sorry, but I do not remember saying that. 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:03:01.279
 I just wanted a computer. 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:05.629
 that the chosen route would lead to nothing would change after it was also made by 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.609
 This is what I'm trying to demonstrate. 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.509
 what actually exists a shorter route to reach the planet Mars 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:15.749
 Are you wanting to know more than the clearest computed yes 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.729
 forget that I was the one who built the computer 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:21.089
 coffee 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:23.149
 I know I'm lucky for little 

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:26.339
 It was you who built like humor packs. 

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:27.819
 I would like to see 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:30.819
 your orders in note 

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.599
 on Tuesday and by the computer 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:39.599
 She is the theft I invented. 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:44.589
 of course 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:50.489
 I would like to have it at home. 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.209
 I'm sorry, sir, but I'm married to a microwave. 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.209
 in him 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.339
 I said that 

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:03.609
 It's what matters what I think. 

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.139
 sugar is bad 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:06.909
 something wrong 

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:09.909
 another high point of the tricolor celebration lost time 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:33.819
 Thank you. 

00:04:33.819 --> 00:04:36.819
 it was simply one of the bolts that was a bit loose 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.559
 I do not understand 

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.559
 You said that eventually 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.419
 this same flight until it will support your project 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.300
 certain that she is in this mayor and a computer 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:57.110
 what will be hidden that no human being can do 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.129
 only lately she has failed in the project 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:03.759
 I think it was because of 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:05.259
 fux that was released 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:08.259
 biggest reason to mistrust your project 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.379
 it is a robot that does not meet the quality standards 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.420
 that confidence 'we can have a rocket like this 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.420
 what we intend to throw to the planet Mars 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:24.759
 however it is important to continue arguing that you can withdraw 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.009
 the process 

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.099
 your father 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:56.300
 Who could help me? 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.639
 he rolled 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:01.020
 this support did not count on my 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.020
 I already taught 

00:06:05.749 --> 00:06:08.749
 throughout the capital 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.449
 the ecuatorian government 

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:15.080
 that too, but yes 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.690
 Have you looked in the mirror every day? 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.990
 more than that 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.050
 Let me tell you something, I have to understand if I had this career. 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:28.050
 it's also getting a lower mood 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:32.849
 they do not contain the problem yet 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:34.710
 I have to understand 

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.720
 I'm aware of this 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.720
 but in the danone cup 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:40.749
 declares first 

00:06:40.749 --> 00:06:43.969
 I'm always done since July 31 the project 

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:47.759
 a project as important as its own consequence 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:52.699
 I've been waiting nine months. 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:06:59.009
 the menu 

00:06:59.009 --> 00:07:02.009
 who does not want to say the project itself 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.550
 however the certainty that he would reach the goal conceded 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.460
 I do not know why you did not understand, right? 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:20.559
 like this 

00:07:20.559 --> 00:07:21.839
 You are wrong 

00:07:21.839 --> 00:07:26.719
 so I'm just a scientist you can believe that it takes a lot 

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:29.719
 intelligent to be able to release a group of civilians 

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:33.409
 You have to have world feeling. 

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:37.879
 now missing by teams 

00:07:37.879 --> 00:07:40.879
 It's good that space 

00:07:41.479 --> 00:07:43.629
 since the same 

00:07:43.629 --> 00:07:47.490
 I was always afraid that someone unknown to this first astronaut 

00:07:47.489 --> 00:07:50.069
 step on the first part 

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:52.569
 little deopis said 

00:07:52.569 --> 00:07:55.740
 the astronaut to be an epic moment 

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.530
 I want 

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:58.500
 is not for nothing
