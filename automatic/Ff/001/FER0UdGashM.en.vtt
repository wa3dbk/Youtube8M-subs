00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:25.809 
for this movie and they lasted some
stuff<00:02:24.950> but<00:02:25.069> in<00:02:25.159> other<00:02:25.280> parts<00:02:25.550> they<00:02:25.760> were

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
stuff but in other parts they were

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.059 
stuff but in other parts they were
really<00:02:26.180> offended<00:02:26.629> by<00:02:26.750> it<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.110> there<00:02:27.860> was<00:02:27.980> at

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
really offended by it and there was at

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:29.680 
really offended by it and there was at
least<00:02:28.099> four<00:02:28.459> people<00:02:28.790> who<00:02:29.060> walked<00:02:29.269> out<00:02:29.450> of<00:02:29.629> this

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
least four people who walked out of this

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.630 
least four people who walked out of this
movie<00:02:29.930> when<00:02:30.050> I<00:02:30.110> saw<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:30.620> rightfully<00:02:31.129> so<00:02:31.129> like

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
movie when I saw and rightfully so like

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.770 
movie when I saw and rightfully so like
I<00:02:31.730> said<00:02:31.790> before<00:02:31.970> this<00:02:32.239> movie<00:02:32.480> has<00:02:32.659> an

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
I said before this movie has an

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.630 
I said before this movie has an
unbelievable<00:02:33.050> cast<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:34.159> it<00:02:34.280> was<00:02:34.370> actually

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 
unbelievable cast and it was actually

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.240 
unbelievable cast and it was actually
filmed<00:02:34.790> over<00:02:35.030> like<00:02:35.300> 10<00:02:35.720> years<00:02:35.959> i<00:02:36.080> think<00:02:36.319> all

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
filmed over like 10 years i think all

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.559 
filmed over like 10 years i think all
different<00:02:37.519> directors<00:02:37.849> all<00:02:38.000> different<00:02:38.330> stars

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
different directors all different stars

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.350 
different directors all different stars
so<00:02:39.140> i'm<00:02:39.230> guessing<00:02:39.470> that<00:02:39.739> they<00:02:40.159> found<00:02:40.430> places

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 
so i'm guessing that they found places

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.449 
so i'm guessing that they found places
in<00:02:41.599> their<00:02:41.720> schedule<00:02:42.080> these<00:02:42.230> stars<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.860> go<00:02:43.280> and

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
in their schedule these stars to go and

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.800 
in their schedule these stars to go and
shoot<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.730> short<00:02:43.879> for<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.180> movie<00:02:44.420> and<00:02:44.569> then<00:02:44.659> do

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
shoot a short for the movie and then do

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.449 
shoot a short for the movie and then do
whatever<00:02:45.019> else<00:02:45.230> they<00:02:45.440> wanted<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.739> do<00:02:45.859> but<00:02:46.280> i

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
whatever else they wanted to do but i

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.000 
whatever else they wanted to do but i
don't<00:02:46.549> know<00:02:47.090> what<00:02:47.569> besides<00:02:47.780> the<00:02:48.139> money<00:02:48.319> could

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
don't know what besides the money could

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.070 
don't know what besides the money could
have<00:02:49.069> could<00:02:49.730> have

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
have could have

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:51.780

there's<00:03:18.250> just<00:03:18.400> one<00:03:18.670> skit<00:03:19.600> that's<00:03:19.840> like<00:03:19.960> a

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.050 
there's just one skit that's like a

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.410 
there's just one skit that's like a
Batman<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.620> Robin<00:03:20.980> skit<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.400> is<00:03:21.580> so<00:03:21.910> painful

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
Batman and Robin skit that is so painful

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.480 
Batman and Robin skit that is so painful
just<00:03:22.540> feels<00:03:22.750> like<00:03:22.840> an<00:03:23.200> SNL<00:03:23.950> skit<00:03:24.250> that<00:03:24.370> was

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 
just feels like an SNL skit that was

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:25.950 
just feels like an SNL skit that was
discarded<00:03:24.790> just<00:03:25.090> because<00:03:25.270> of<00:03:25.330> how<00:03:25.420> awful<00:03:25.840> it

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
discarded just because of how awful it

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.850

was oh my o.o who makes my vehicle just

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.990 
was oh my o.o who makes my vehicle just
one<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.040> those<00:03:30.130> movies<00:03:30.430> that<00:03:30.459> unfortunately

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
one of those movies that unfortunately

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.610 
one of those movies that unfortunately
completely<00:03:31.600> squandered<00:03:31.840> all<00:03:32.080> the<00:03:32.230> potential

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
completely squandered all the potential

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.620 
completely squandered all the potential
that<00:03:32.709> it<00:03:32.830> had<00:03:33.010> it<00:03:33.459> had<00:03:33.490> an<00:03:33.670> amazing<00:03:34.090> cast<00:03:34.300> it

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
that it had it had an amazing cast it

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.180 
that it had it had an amazing cast it
had<00:03:34.780> a<00:03:34.810> good<00:03:35.020> set<00:03:35.230> of<00:03:35.260> writers<00:03:35.740> and<00:03:35.770> directors

had a good set of writers and directors

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.250 
had a good set of writers and directors
and<00:03:36.880> just<00:03:37.510> couldn't<00:03:37.720> do<00:03:37.780> anything<00:03:37.990> with<00:03:38.230> it

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
and just couldn't do anything with it

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.840 
and just couldn't do anything with it
and<00:03:38.500> it's<00:03:38.770> just<00:03:39.100> further<00:03:39.310> proof<00:03:39.610> that<00:03:39.640> the
