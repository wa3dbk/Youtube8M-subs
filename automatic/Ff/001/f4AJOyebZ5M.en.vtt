the water cannon that's modeled on the
front<00:02:30.010> at<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.070> back<00:02:31.370> there's<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.730> spraying<00:02:32.120> bar

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
front at the back there's a spraying bar

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.240 
front at the back there's a spraying bar
with<00:02:32.690> valves<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.440> that's<00:02:33.650> all<00:02:33.799> modelled<00:02:34.100> in

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
with valves and that's all modelled in

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.570 
with valves and that's all modelled in
metal

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
metal

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.640 
metal
there<00:02:35.239> are<00:02:35.390> various<00:02:35.780> elements<00:02:35.870> on<00:02:36.260> the<00:02:36.380> tank

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
there are various elements on the tank

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.320 
there are various elements on the tank
made<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:37.010> soft<00:02:37.280> plastic<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.790> that<00:02:37.940> includes

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
made of soft plastic and that includes

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.150 
made of soft plastic and that includes
the<00:02:38.540> ladder<00:02:38.750> handrails<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.650> the<00:02:39.799> safety

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
the ladder handrails and the safety

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.759 
the ladder handrails and the safety
rails<00:02:40.370> on<00:02:40.549> the<00:02:40.580> side<00:02:40.700> a<00:02:41.230> health<00:02:42.230> and<00:02:42.380> safety<00:02:42.709> is

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:42.769 
rails on the side a health and safety is

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.350 
rails on the side a health and safety is
wasted<00:02:43.190> on<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.400> cranes<00:02:43.639> etc

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
wasted on the cranes etc

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.970 
wasted on the cranes etc
I<00:02:44.390> must<00:02:44.750> think<00:02:44.960> they're<00:02:45.050> made<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.350> unbreakable

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980 
I must think they're made of unbreakable

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.460 
I must think they're made of unbreakable
plastic<00:02:46.130> or<00:02:46.550> something

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.770 

so<00:02:53.470> now<00:02:53.620> it's<00:02:53.800> time<00:02:54.040> to<00:02:54.190> take<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.520> NWT<00:02:54.970> 30<00:02:55.420> out

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
so now it's time to take the NWT 30 out

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.170 
so now it's time to take the NWT 30 out
into<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.260> test<00:02:56.530> quarry<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.220> it's<00:02:57.790> all<00:02:58.000> birth

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
into the test quarry and it's all birth

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.020 
into the test quarry and it's all birth
shape<00:02:58.420> rolls<00:02:58.690> along<00:02:58.870> very<00:02:59.170> nicely<00:02:59.850> both<00:03:00.850> the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030

front and the rear wheels are very free
spinning<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:04.180> very<00:03:04.330> nice<00:03:04.570> feature<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:05.170> the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
spinning and a very nice feature is the

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.520 
spinning and a very nice feature is the
heavy<00:03:05.530> sprung<00:03:05.950> suspension<00:03:06.190> on<00:03:06.730> the<00:03:06.850> rear<00:03:07.000> axle

heavy sprung suspension on the rear axle

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.020 
heavy sprung suspension on the rear axle
also<00:03:08.530> nice<00:03:08.740> at<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.010> back<00:03:09.160> of<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.430> flexible

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
also nice at the back of the flexible

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.400 
also nice at the back of the flexible
mud<00:03:10.240> flaps<00:03:10.540> it<00:03:10.870> would<00:03:10.960> have<00:03:11.050> been<00:03:11.170> good<00:03:11.290> if

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
mud flaps it would have been good if

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:12.660 
mud flaps it would have been good if
there<00:03:11.560> been<00:03:11.710> some<00:03:11.950> in<00:03:12.040> front<00:03:12.280> of<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.490> rear

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
there been some in front of the rear

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.210 
there been some in front of the rear
wheels<00:03:12.910> too<00:03:13.210> and<00:03:13.450> at<00:03:14.350> the<00:03:14.470> front<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.770> steering

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.640 
wheels too and at the front the steering
mechanism<00:03:15.250> works<00:03:15.910> well<00:03:16.180> enough<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:17.500> can

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
mechanism works well enough you can

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.110 
mechanism works well enough you can
achieve<00:03:17.740> a<00:03:17.950> sensible<00:03:18.460> angle<00:03:18.760> before<00:03:18.880> the

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.090 
tires fouled on the tanks behind and it

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:23.940 
tires fouled on the tanks behind and it
pushes<00:03:22.300> along<00:03:22.630> just<00:03:22.780> fine<00:03:23.080> in<00:03:23.380> a<00:03:23.500> reasonable

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
pushes along just fine in a reasonable

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.460 
pushes along just fine in a reasonable
curve<00:03:24.690> let's<00:03:25.690> have<00:03:25.870> another<00:03:25.960> look<00:03:26.200> at<00:03:26.290> that

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
curve let's have another look at that

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.260 
curve let's have another look at that
suspension<00:03:26.680> again<00:03:27.310> and<00:03:27.640> it<00:03:27.760> makes<00:03:27.940> you<00:03:28.090> wonder

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:28.270 
suspension again and it makes you wonder

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.700 
suspension again and it makes you wonder
what<00:03:28.480> on<00:03:28.600> earth<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:28.930> going<00:03:28.960> on<00:03:29.320> in<00:03:29.530> that

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
what on earth is going on in that

what on earth is going on in that
operators<00:03:30.250> cab<00:03:31.410> another<00:03:32.410> feature<00:03:32.710> of<00:03:32.830> the

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:32.980 
operators cab another feature of the

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.680 
operators cab another feature of the
model<00:03:33.220> is<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.370> bars<00:03:33.730> that<00:03:33.940> remove<00:03:34.360> debris

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
model is the bars that remove debris

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.010 
model is the bars that remove debris
from<00:03:34.960> between<00:03:35.770> the<00:03:35.950> tires<00:03:36.750> so<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.810> should

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
from between the tires so you should

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:39.450 
from between the tires so you should
find<00:03:38.200> no<00:03:38.350> problem<00:03:38.770> with<00:03:38.920> this<00:03:39.010> vehicle

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:39.460 
find no problem with this vehicle

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.490 
find no problem with this vehicle
getting<00:03:39.640> jammed<00:03:39.940> up<00:03:40.150> with<00:03:40.330> carpet<00:03:40.870> fluff<00:03:41.170> or

getting jammed up with carpet fluff or

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.670 
getting jammed up with carpet fluff or
worse<00:03:42.720> another<00:03:43.720> feature<00:03:43.990> is<00:03:44.230> that<00:03:44.410> the<00:03:44.530> hole

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
worse another feature is that the hole

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.740 
worse another feature is that the hole
of<00:03:44.830> the<00:03:44.920> tank<00:03:45.220> tilts<00:03:45.670> on<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.790> pair<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.090> two-stage

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
of the tank tilts on a pair of two-stage

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.020 
of the tank tilts on a pair of two-stage

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
cylinders and that's been implemented

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.530 
cylinders and that's been implemented
quite<00:03:49.390> nicely<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.960> works<00:03:50.170> well<00:03:51.390> looking<00:03:52.390> from

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
quite nicely and works well looking from

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.000 
quite nicely and works well looking from
a<00:03:52.570> bit<00:03:52.750> further<00:03:52.930> back<00:03:53.230> you<00:03:53.380> can<00:03:53.560> see<00:03:53.740> that<00:03:53.770> it

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
a bit further back you can see that it

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.100 
a bit further back you can see that it
tilts<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.580> a<00:03:54.610> really<00:03:54.940> a<00:03:54.970> pretty<00:03:55.300> steep<00:03:55.570> angle

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:56.110 
tilts to a really a pretty steep angle

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:58.170 
tilts to a really a pretty steep angle
and<00:03:56.320> that's<00:03:57.280> not<00:03:57.430> to<00:03:57.580> get<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.850> water<00:03:58.000> out

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
and that's not to get the water out

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.210 
and that's not to get the water out
that's<00:03:58.540> to<00:03:58.750> allow<00:03:58.810> access<00:03:59.290> to<00:03:59.590> the<00:03:59.770> chassis

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
that's to allow access to the chassis

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.210 
that's to allow access to the chassis
for<00:04:00.489> servicing<00:04:01.680> there<00:04:02.680> are<00:04:02.800> another<00:04:03.130> couple

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
for servicing there are another couple

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.560 
for servicing there are another couple
of<00:04:03.550> small<00:04:03.790> features<00:04:04.150> which<00:04:04.300> are<00:04:04.390> quite

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:04.570 
of small features which are quite

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:06.479 
of small features which are quite
interesting<00:04:04.630> there's<00:04:05.380> a<00:04:05.440> little<00:04:05.650> gate<00:04:05.890> at<00:04:06.220> the

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:06.489 
interesting there's a little gate at the

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:08.460 
interesting there's a little gate at the
top<00:04:06.760> of<00:04:06.880> the<00:04:07.000> stairs<00:04:07.270> which<00:04:07.570> allows<00:04:07.870> access<00:04:08.080> to

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
top of the stairs which allows access to

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.830 
top of the stairs which allows access to
the<00:04:08.620> ladder<00:04:08.830> and<00:04:09.100> one<00:04:10.090> of<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.330> mirrors<00:04:10.600> moves

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840
