00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.970 
forget it is a network enabled service
every<00:00:10.300> transaction<00:00:10.750> that<00:00:11.019> goes<00:00:11.200> through<00:00:11.590> Siri

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:11.980 
every transaction that goes through Siri

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.280 
every transaction that goes through Siri
has<00:00:12.639> to<00:00:12.940> be<00:00:13.090> going<00:00:13.240> through<00:00:13.420> an<00:00:13.690> apple<00:00:14.019> server

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.290 
has to be going through an apple server

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.880 
has to be going through an apple server
somewhere<00:00:14.679> and<00:00:15.749> that<00:00:16.749> information<00:00:17.289> is<00:00:17.710> being

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
somewhere and that information is being

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.880 
somewhere and that information is being
captured<00:00:18.159> it's<00:00:18.999> building<00:00:19.779> a<00:00:19.989> huge<00:00:20.349> amount<00:00:20.739> of

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
captured it's building a huge amount of

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.269 
captured it's building a huge amount of
knowledge<00:00:21.429> not<00:00:22.300> only<00:00:22.329> about<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:23.169> phrases<00:00:24.159> we

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:24.279 
knowledge not only about the phrases we

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.630 
knowledge not only about the phrases we
use<00:00:24.880> but<00:00:25.449> rather<00:00:25.720> also<00:00:26.169> about<00:00:26.739> who<00:00:27.039> we<00:00:27.189> are<00:00:27.369> and

what<00:00:27.759> we<00:00:27.970> want<00:00:28.179> and<00:00:28.509> it's<00:00:29.380> basically<00:00:29.829> doing

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
what we want and it's basically doing

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.300 
what we want and it's basically doing
what<00:00:30.369> Google<00:00:30.669> is<00:00:30.729> doing<00:00:30.809> Siri<00:00:31.809> is<00:00:32.110> Google<00:00:32.680> with

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
what Google is doing Siri is Google with

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.920 
what Google is doing Siri is Google with
voice<00:00:33.550> and<00:00:35.220> you<00:00:36.270> realize<00:00:37.270> of<00:00:37.480> course<00:00:37.570> what

voice and you realize of course what

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.390 
voice and you realize of course what

they'll say well it's all aggregated and

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.580 
they'll say well it's all aggregated and
all<00:02:26.000> that<00:02:26.180> stuff<00:02:26.360> you're<00:02:26.690> not<00:02:26.930> targeting<00:02:27.470> you

all that stuff you're not targeting you

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.140 
all that stuff you're not targeting you
individually<00:02:28.280> where<00:02:28.520> you're<00:02:28.670> part<00:02:28.970> of<00:02:29.060> a

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
individually where you're part of a

group but still we want they want to
know<00:02:31.940> you<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.900> I<00:02:33.200> think<00:02:33.260> really<00:02:33.770> ultimately

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
know you so I think really ultimately

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.820 
know you so I think really ultimately
this<00:02:35.510> is<00:02:35.750> what<00:02:35.930> happened<00:02:36.320> this<00:02:36.380> was<00:02:36.560> happening

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
this is what happened this was happening

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.340 
this is what happened this was happening
with<00:02:37.100> cloud<00:02:37.540> iCloud<00:02:38.540> this<00:02:39.020> is<00:02:39.170> what's

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
with cloud iCloud this is what's

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.130 
with cloud iCloud this is what's
happening<00:02:39.800> with<00:02:40.060> with<00:02:41.060> fire<00:02:41.390> this<00:02:41.780> is<00:02:41.960> what's

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
happening with with fire this is what's

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.690 
happening with with fire this is what's
happening<00:02:42.620> with<00:02:42.710> Siri<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.370> is<00:02:43.520> what's

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
happening with Siri this is what's

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.610 
happening with Siri this is what's
happening<00:02:43.880> with<00:02:44.330> google<00:02:44.750> has<00:02:44.990> been<00:02:45.230> happening

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
happening with google has been happening

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.110 
happening with google has been happening
actually<00:02:45.770> Google<00:02:46.160> tiny<00:02:46.400> or<00:02:46.670> this<00:02:46.820> whole<00:02:46.970> idea

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
actually Google tiny or this whole idea

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.770 
actually Google tiny or this whole idea
sort<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.870> people<00:02:48.680> are<00:02:48.770> catching<00:02:48.980> up<00:02:49.370> with<00:02:49.520> it

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
sort of people are catching up with it

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.110 
sort of people are catching up with it
and<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:51.620> that's<00:02:51.800> really<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.459> think<00:02:52.610> part<00:02:53.030> of

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
and so that's really I think part of

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.670 
and so that's really I think part of
what's<00:02:53.300> happening<00:02:53.750> and<00:02:54.110> and<00:02:55.100> that's<00:02:56.090> why<00:02:56.330> I'm

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
what's happening and and that's why I'm

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.020 
what's happening and and that's why I'm
I<00:02:57.680> think<00:02:58.220> it's<00:02:58.340> going<00:02:58.459> to<00:02:58.520> take<00:02:58.730> a<00:02:58.760> while<00:02:58.850> for

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
I think it's going to take a while for

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.030 
I think it's going to take a while for
this<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.390> sink<00:02:59.780> in<00:03:00.020> we<00:03:00.350> have<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.680> look<00:03:00.860> at<00:03:01.010> it

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
this to sink in we have to look at it

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.620 
this to sink in we have to look at it
from<00:03:01.310> all<00:03:01.520> angles<00:03:01.790> we<00:03:02.120> have<00:03:02.209> to<00:03:02.330> look<00:03:02.480> at<00:03:02.600> it

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:02.630 
from all angles we have to look at it

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.380 
from all angles we have to look at it
competitively<00:03:03.230> we<00:03:03.440> have<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.680> look<00:03:03.830> at<00:03:03.980> it

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
competitively we have to look at it

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.670 
competitively we have to look at it
technologically<00:03:05.390> but<00:03:06.020> we<00:03:06.170> have<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.410> look<00:03:06.530> at

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
technologically but we have to look at

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.530 
technologically but we have to look at
the<00:03:06.709> business<00:03:07.160> model<00:03:07.370> as<00:03:07.610> well<00:03:07.640> I<00:03:08.090> mean<00:03:08.420> this

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
the business model as well I mean this

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.330 
the business model as well I mean this
is<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.750> huge<00:03:09.140> amount<00:03:09.440> of<00:03:09.500> money<00:03:09.560> to<00:03:09.890> spend<00:03:09.920> on

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
is a huge amount of money to spend on

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.100 
is a huge amount of money to spend on
infrastructure<00:03:10.490> on<00:03:11.390> on<00:03:11.750> on<00:03:12.110> this<00:03:12.880> AI<00:03:13.930> which<00:03:14.930> is

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.110 
infrastructure on on on this AI which is

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.310 
infrastructure on on on this AI which is
of<00:03:15.260> course<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.590> dream<00:03:15.830> of<00:03:16.010> everyone<00:03:16.430> right<00:03:17.320> for

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
of course a dream of everyone right for

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.229 
of course a dream of everyone right for
what<00:03:18.500> purpose<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:19.160> sell<00:03:19.400> more<00:03:19.519> iphones<00:03:19.970> I

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:20.239 
what purpose to sell more iphones I

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:29.170 
what purpose to sell more iphones I
think<00:03:20.660> that's<00:03:20.840> naive
