have it's a mechanic's movement it's not

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.810 
have it's a mechanic's movement it's not
automatic<00:02:59.420> because<00:02:59.830> it's<00:03:00.830> a<00:03:01.040> zero<00:03:01.340> gravity<00:03:01.430> in

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:01.820 
automatic because it's a zero gravity in

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:03.880 
automatic because it's a zero gravity in
space<00:03:01.850> so<00:03:02.420> an<00:03:02.690> automatic<00:03:03.350> watch<00:03:03.500> wouldn't

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:03.890 
space so an automatic watch wouldn't

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.140 
space so an automatic watch wouldn't
work<00:03:04.220> that<00:03:05.150> good<00:03:05.800> and<00:03:06.800> here<00:03:07.250> it's<00:03:07.550> not<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
work that good and here it's not the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.940 
work that good and here it's not the
sapphire<00:03:08.840> crystal<00:03:09.970> it's<00:03:10.970> a<00:03:11.600> plus<00:03:12.560> it's<00:03:12.860> like

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
sapphire crystal it's a plus it's like

sapphire crystal it's a plus it's like
the<00:03:13.130> sort<00:03:13.400> of<00:03:13.520> I<00:03:14.090> don't<00:03:14.330> know<00:03:14.540> what<00:03:15.050> it's

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
called in English but it's a shadow free

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.090

shatter because that would be dangerous

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.780 
shatter because that would be dangerous
in<00:03:25.220> space<00:03:25.870> but<00:03:26.870> it's<00:03:27.320> it's<00:03:27.920> easy<00:03:28.400> to<00:03:28.640> get

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
in space but it's it's easy to get

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.950 
in space but it's it's easy to get
scratches<00:03:29.360> on<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:29.540> but<00:03:30.320> it<00:03:30.410> doesn't<00:03:30.590> you<00:03:31.550> know
