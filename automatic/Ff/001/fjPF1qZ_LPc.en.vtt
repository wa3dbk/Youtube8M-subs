know<00:03:58.870> you<00:03:59.320> get<00:03:59.470> lost<00:03:59.709> I'm<00:04:00.040> dolor<00:04:00.310> really<00:04:00.580> they

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:00.760 
know you get lost I'm dolor really they

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.160 
know you get lost I'm dolor really they
could<00:04:00.880> get<00:04:01.000> along<00:04:01.120> over<00:04:01.300> time<00:04:01.510> to<00:04:01.630> prepare<00:04:01.930> so

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
could get along over time to prepare so

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.260 
could get along over time to prepare so
I<00:04:02.350> think<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.800> coaches<00:04:03.010> do<00:04:03.310> play<00:04:03.550> a<00:04:03.580> bigger

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270
