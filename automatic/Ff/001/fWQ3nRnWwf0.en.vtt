like one to two a four five there's six

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.689 
like one to two a four five there's six
words<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.219> good<00:00:53.370> to<00:00:53.489> get<00:00:53.610> three<00:00:55.699> it's

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
words this is good to get three it's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.130 
words this is good to get three it's
also<00:00:57.530> will<00:00:58.530> you<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.770> both<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.010> them<00:00:59.809> like<00:01:00.809> so

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
also will you do both of them like so

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.959 
also will you do both of them like so
it's<00:01:01.800> going<00:01:01.949> to<00:01:02.039> leave<00:01:02.160> off<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.340> whole<00:01:02.760> edge

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
it's going to leave off a whole edge

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.270 
it's going to leave off a whole edge
here<00:01:03.480> so<00:01:03.510> make<00:01:04.140> sure<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.439> edge<00:01:04.710> there's<00:01:05.129> two

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
here so make sure this edge there's two

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.690 
here so make sure this edge there's two
edges<00:01:05.549> at<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.760> side<00:01:05.970> at<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.420> end<00:01:07.700> you're

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
edges at the side at the end you're

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.429 
edges at the side at the end you're
going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.880> take<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.270> 2<00:01:09.330> by<00:01:09.510> 6<00:01:09.659> so<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.229> get<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
going to take a 2 by 6 so you get a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.969 
going to take a 2 by 6 so you get a
patient<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.979> bed<00:01:11.220> set<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.729> it<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:11.970> top<00:01:12.299> -<00:01:12.979> is

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
patient the bed set to it of top - is

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.840 
patient the bed set to it of top - is
this<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.310> -<00:01:14.630> between<00:01:15.630> two<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.310> it<00:01:17.430> needs<00:01:17.640> up

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
this a - between two so it needs up

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.730 
this a - between two so it needs up
three<00:01:18.509> rows<00:01:18.750> in<00:01:19.320> three<00:01:19.770> words<00:01:20.240> type<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.740> then

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
three rows in three words type so then

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.060 
three rows in three words type so then
you're<00:01:22.860> going<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> get<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.400> flat<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:25.290> flat<00:01:25.830> to

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
you're going to get a flat to a flat to

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.770 
you're going to get a flat to a flat to
basics

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
basics

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.350 
basics
so<00:01:27.780> I<00:01:27.810> flat<00:01:28.290> 2<00:01:28.500> by<00:01:28.650> 6<00:01:28.950> with<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> flat<00:01:29.700> 2<00:01:29.850> by<00:01:29.970> 4<00:01:30.210> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
so I flat 2 by 6 with a flat 2 by 4 the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.420 
so I flat 2 by 6 with a flat 2 by 4 the
center<00:01:30.750> of<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:30.930> but<00:01:31.170> there's<00:01:31.350> two<00:01:31.590> here<00:01:31.979> -<00:01:32.220> you

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
center of it but there's two here - you

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.530 
center of it but there's two here - you
like<00:01:33.360> so<00:01:33.570> not<00:01:34.140> sure<00:01:34.320> if<00:01:34.380> it's<00:01:35.329> okay<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.439> see<00:01:38.540> you

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
make yo - these you get a place all

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.340 
make yo - these you get a place all
other<00:01:42.600> side<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.170> this<00:01:43.409> great<00:01:43.680> lecture

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.820 

now<00:01:50.010> you're<00:01:50.820> gonna<00:01:50.940> make<00:01:51.590> something<00:01:52.590> like

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
now you're gonna make something like

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.830 
now you're gonna make something like
this<00:01:53.100> it's<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.090> tough<00:01:54.690> thing<00:01:55.070> and<00:01:56.070> what<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.430> is

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
this it's a tough thing and what it is

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.859 
this it's a tough thing and what it is
basically<00:01:59.030> it's<00:02:00.030> just<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:01.610> little<00:02:02.610> coke<00:02:03.270> they

basically it's just a little coke they
like<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:05.750> connected<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:06.930> a<00:02:07.200> smaller<00:02:07.710> water

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
like so connected to a smaller water

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:16.420 
like so connected to a smaller water
like<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:13.310> like<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.580> all<00:02:14.970> right<00:02:15.150> I<00:02:15.180> have

like this like that all right I have
little<00:02:17.430> connected<00:02:18.120> with<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.650> 1<00:02:19.650> by<00:02:19.680> 4<00:02:20.070> flat<00:02:21.110> it

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
little connected with a 1 by 4 flat it

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.710 
little connected with a 1 by 4 flat it
takes<00:02:22.410> up<00:02:23.090> 2<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.209> this<00:02:24.330> would<00:02:24.600> you<00:02:26.330> two<00:02:27.330> dots<00:02:27.540> of

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
takes up 2 of this would you two dots of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.990 
takes up 2 of this would you two dots of
this<00:02:27.870> would<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.980> two<00:02:29.160> dots<00:02:29.370> out<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.700> smaller

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
this would the two dots out the smaller

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.280 
this would the two dots out the smaller
one<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.730> it<00:02:33.030> means<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.480> when<00:02:34.050> you<00:02:34.110> make

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
this row the bottom row legs up the best

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.240 
this row the bottom row legs up the best
like<00:04:18.840> to<00:04:18.989> see<00:04:19.170> it<00:04:19.290> lines<00:04:19.470> up<00:04:19.650> with<00:04:19.709> that<00:04:20.040> you

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
like to see it lines up with that you

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.100 
like to see it lines up with that you
just<00:04:20.430> connect<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:21.030> so<00:04:23.480> you<00:04:24.480> do<00:04:24.660> that<00:04:24.780> with<00:04:24.990> the

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
just connect it so you do that with the

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.640 
just connect it so you do that with the
other<00:04:25.230> one

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
other one

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:29.510 
other one
instead<00:04:26.160> it's<00:04:26.310> facing<00:04:26.520> the<00:04:26.850> other<00:04:27.030> way<00:04:27.210> so<00:04:28.520> I

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
instead it's facing the other way so I

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.910 
instead it's facing the other way so I
don't<00:04:29.610> know<00:04:30.210> and<00:04:30.570> so<00:04:30.990> for<00:04:31.170> three<00:04:31.320> got<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.740> these

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:31.920 
don't know and so for three got to these

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:38.210 
don't know and so for three got to these
a<00:04:33.770> little<00:04:34.770> few<00:04:35.480> you<00:04:36.480> see<00:04:36.660> these<00:04:36.810> other<00:04:37.500> edges

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
a little few you see these other edges

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.640 
a little few you see these other edges
the<00:04:38.640> upper<00:04:39.620> ng<00:04:40.850> it<00:04:41.930> you're<00:04:42.930> gonna<00:04:43.050> place<00:04:43.380> them

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
the upper ng it you're gonna place them

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.820 
the upper ng it you're gonna place them
right<00:04:44.250> there<00:04:44.580> so<00:04:45.060> you'll<00:04:45.210> get<00:04:45.330> this<00:04:45.480> one<00:04:45.830> let's

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
right there so you'll get this one let's

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:51.110 
right there so you'll get this one let's
face<00:04:47.070> it<00:04:47.100> this<00:04:47.340> way<00:04:47.580> press<00:04:48.510> out<00:04:48.690> the<00:04:48.840> left<00:04:50.120> they

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
face it this way press out the left they

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.840 
face it this way press out the left they
get<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:51.540> one<00:04:51.810> let's<00:04:52.650> face<00:04:53.010> it<00:04:53.040> away<00:04:53.430> place<00:04:53.700> it

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
get this one let's face it away place it

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:58.310 
get this one let's face it away place it
out<00:04:54.030> the<00:04:54.210> right<00:04:54.650> so<00:04:55.650> it<00:04:55.710> looks<00:04:55.770> like<00:04:55.980> that<00:04:57.320> and

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
out the right so it looks like that and

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.040 
out the right so it looks like that and
then<00:04:59.000> you<00:05:00.000> can<00:05:00.120> make<00:05:00.270> something<00:05:00.510> like<00:05:00.660> this

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
then you can make something like this

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.890 
then you can make something like this
you<00:05:01.740> need<00:05:01.830> to<00:05:01.920> get<00:05:02.070> two<00:05:02.310> four<00:05:03.180> by<00:05:03.210> six<00:05:03.570> flats

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 
you need to get two four by six flats

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.660 
you need to get two four by six flats
are<00:05:04.530> you<00:05:04.620> gonna<00:05:04.740> put<00:05:05.040> a<00:05:06.140> 1<00:05:07.140> by<00:05:07.170> 4<00:05:07.560> flat<00:05:07.590> in<00:05:08.160> the

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
are you gonna put a 1 by 4 flat in the
