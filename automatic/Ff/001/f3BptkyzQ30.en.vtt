to<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.900> basis<00:02:07.440> of<00:02:07.650> all<00:02:07.950> other<00:02:08.190> disciplines

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
to be the basis of all other disciplines

to be the basis of all other disciplines
just<00:02:09.060> purely<00:02:09.299> as<00:02:09.510> you<00:02:09.660> said<00:02:09.869> for<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.200> length

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
just purely as you said for the length

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.660 
just purely as you said for the length
of<00:02:10.769> P<00:02:10.979> stand<00:02:11.340> and<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:13.500> availability<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:14.430> train

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
of P stand and the availability to train

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.410 
of P stand and the availability to train
it<00:02:14.850> I<00:02:14.940> mean

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
it I mean

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.940 
it I mean
I<00:02:15.480> did<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.780> lot<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.050> time<00:02:16.349> when<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:16.620> was<00:02:16.709> young<00:02:16.920> and

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.680 
I did a lot of time when I was young and
I<00:02:17.370> think<00:02:17.580> that's<00:02:17.730> giving<00:02:17.940> me<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.060> good<00:02:18.270> basis

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
I think that's giving me a good basis

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.490 
I think that's giving me a good basis
giving<00:02:18.959> me<00:02:19.050> a<00:02:19.080> good<00:02:20.030> sort<00:02:21.030> of<00:02:21.120> platform<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.410> be

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
giving me a good sort of platform to be

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.930 
giving me a good sort of platform to be
able<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.770> build<00:02:22.950> on<00:02:23.160> through<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.610> rest<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.819> my

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
make different turn shapes it's

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.540 
make different turn shapes it's
something<00:02:31.560> that<00:02:31.709> kid's<00:02:31.920> gonna<00:02:32.069> have<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.400> learn

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
stuff you see how easy it is how easy it

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.009 
stuff you see how easy it is how easy it
looks<00:02:50.670> and<00:02:51.030> they're<00:02:51.150> really<00:02:51.420> talented<00:02:51.600> ones

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
make you look really easy without having

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:56.300 
make you look really easy without having
to<00:02:54.390> having<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.260> think<00:02:55.440> about<00:02:55.590> it<00:02:55.890> and<00:02:55.980> work<00:02:56.130> at

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
to having to think about it and work at

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.800 
to having to think about it and work at
it<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.670> they're<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.120> ones<00:02:57.269> that<00:02:57.390> seem<00:02:57.690> to

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
it and they're the ones that seem to

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.930 
it and they're the ones that seem to
make<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.049> changes<00:02:58.500> really<00:02:58.739> quickly<00:02:59.250> you<00:02:59.760> just

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
make the changes really quickly you just

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.280 
make the changes really quickly you just
have<00:03:00.060> to<00:03:00.090> say<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.360> couple<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.750> things<00:03:00.810> to<00:03:01.080> them

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
have to say a couple of things to them

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.800 
have to say a couple of things to them
and<00:03:01.500> they<00:03:01.650> will<00:03:02.040> you<00:03:02.940> know<00:03:03.060> be<00:03:03.330> able<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.660> put

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
and they will you know be able to put

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.020 
and they will you know be able to put
that<00:03:03.840> in<00:03:04.080> their<00:03:04.230> brain<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.860> replicate<00:03:05.819> what

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
that in their brain and replicate what

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.080 
that in their brain and replicate what
you're<00:03:06.239> what<00:03:07.019> you're<00:03:07.049> instructing<00:03:07.860> on<00:03:08.819> the

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
you're what you're instructing on the

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.300 
you're what you're instructing on the
actual<00:03:09.330> snow<00:03:09.569> so<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.170> think<00:03:10.650> that's<00:03:10.890> kind<00:03:11.220> of

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
actual snow so I think that's kind of

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.070 
actual snow so I think that's kind of
that's<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.060> kind<00:03:12.299> of<00:03:12.360> little<00:03:12.569> things<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.870> can

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
that's the kind of little things you can

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.740 
that's the kind of little things you can
look<00:03:13.200> for<00:03:13.819> so<00:03:14.819> if<00:03:14.880> you<00:03:14.970> want<00:03:15.120> to<00:03:15.180> ski<00:03:15.360> like<00:03:15.390> some

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
look for so if you want to ski like some

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.840 
look for so if you want to ski like some
