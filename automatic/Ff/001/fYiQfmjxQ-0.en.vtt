 event and sup com school has 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.910
 right now I'm going to ask you if 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.680
 this is the first time that sup de com 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.450
 organize an event as is so yes 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.410
 this is the first time before there was 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.420
 the 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:38.600
 business form so it was a forum that 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.550
 have organized within the university at 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.660
 within sup com where we want to 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.040
 precisely professionals in 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.550
 communication to exchange with 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.110
 students the students of sup de com 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.450
 and then we said to ourselves this year 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.360
 would be nice for this event so 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.160
 be accessible to a wider audience 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.010
 is an audience of high school students who can 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.570
 access precisely this offer to this 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.340
 event more easily so we have 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.320
 decided to do it in the city center 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.880
 we had the opportunity in addition to having 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.200
 this space which is this place 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.330
 bellecour it's a place place 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.640
 bellecour anyway what is the place 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.720
 the most prestigious lyon so we 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:13.700
 thought we're going to do this event and 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.500
 and also a little bit expanded the 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.500
 things beyond having an exchange with 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.030
 communication professionals 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.110
 also do an exhibition of what we 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.390
 admits not call business cards 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.250
 so the presentation of the trades the 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.700
 plus the most representative panel of 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.700
 communication professions 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.560
 it was the presentation of space 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.850
