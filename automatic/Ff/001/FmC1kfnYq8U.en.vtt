with<00:00:00.420> any<00:00:00.599> booster<00:00:01.110> and<00:00:01.260> any<00:00:01.709> pedal<00:00:02.040> in

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
with any booster and any pedal in

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.770 
with any booster and any pedal in
general<00:00:02.429> you<00:00:02.550> can<00:00:02.669> say<00:00:02.700> it's<00:00:03.419> really

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
general you can say it's really

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.019 
general you can say it's really
simplicity<00:00:04.529> that's<00:00:04.680> the<00:00:04.890> key<00:00:05.100> so<00:00:05.819> having

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
simplicity that's the key so having

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:07.970 
simplicity that's the key so having
something<00:00:06.359> that's<00:00:06.509> just<00:00:06.930> small<00:00:07.259> and<00:00:07.529> super

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
something that's just small and super

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.089 
something that's just small and super
simple<00:00:08.130> just<00:00:08.820> one<00:00:09.030> enough<00:00:09.240> for<00:00:09.450> volume<00:00:09.780> is<00:00:10.099> the

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
simple just one enough for volume is the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:29.480 
simple just one enough for volume is the
way<00:00:11.250> guitar<00:00:11.639> players<00:00:11.880> like<00:00:12.120> things<00:00:28.369> coming<00:00:29.369> up

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
way guitar players like things coming up

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.130 
way guitar players like things coming up
with<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.730> idea<00:00:30.000> for<00:00:30.090> spark<00:00:30.539> mini<00:00:30.750> booster

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
with the idea for spark mini booster

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.200 
with the idea for spark mini booster
doesn't<00:00:31.830> really<00:00:32.040> feel<00:00:32.430> like<00:00:32.489> coming<00:00:33.059> up<00:00:33.180> with

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
doesn't really feel like coming up with

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.240 
doesn't really feel like coming up with
an<00:00:33.420> idea<00:00:33.510> at<00:00:33.809> all<00:00:33.899> because<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.590> just<00:00:34.890> it

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
an idea at all because it's just it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.880 
an idea at all because it's just it
seems<00:00:35.489> so<00:00:35.700> obvious<00:00:35.880> and<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:37.200> be<00:00:37.320> honest<00:00:37.620> it's<00:00:37.829> a

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
seems so obvious and to be honest it's a

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.560 
seems so obvious and to be honest it's a
pedal<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.309> just<00:00:38.550> wanted<00:00:38.820> for<00:00:39.000> myself<00:00:39.390> for

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
pedal that I just wanted for myself for

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.000 
pedal that I just wanted for myself for
so<00:00:39.750> long<00:00:39.930> I've<00:00:40.200> been<00:00:40.230> using<00:00:40.530> different

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
so long I've been using different

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.950 
so long I've been using different
boosters<00:00:41.610> and<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.879> course<00:00:42.090> spark<00:00:42.480> booster<00:00:42.840> for

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
boosters and of course spark booster for

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.750 
boosters and of course spark booster for
a<00:00:43.050> while<00:00:43.230> now<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.710> in<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> clintons<00:00:44.520> mode

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
a while now just in the clintons mode

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.790 
a while now just in the clintons mode
and<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.450> just<00:00:45.660> really<00:00:46.079> wanted<00:00:46.350> something<00:00:46.559> that

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
and I just really wanted something that

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.400 
and I just really wanted something that
did<00:00:46.980> just<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.610> clean<00:00:47.789> through<00:00:47.940> side<00:00:48.239> in<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.960> super

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
did just a clean through side in a super

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.049 
did just a clean through side in a super
small<00:00:49.649> form<00:00:49.950> factor<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.579> fit<00:00:50.760> on<00:00:50.879> any

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
small form factor that I can fit on any

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.049 
small form factor that I can fit on any
of<00:00:51.210> my<00:00:51.329> pedal<00:00:51.629> boards<00:00:55.520> but<00:00:56.520> obviously<00:00:56.879> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
of my pedal boards but obviously the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.849 
of my pedal boards but obviously the
most<00:00:57.270> important<00:00:57.780> part<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.050> any<00:00:58.289> pedal<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.829> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
most important part of any pedal is the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.010 
most important part of any pedal is the
sound<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.520> sparkly<00:01:00.180> booster<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.660> sounds

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
sound and sparkly booster just sounds

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.160 
sound and sparkly booster just sounds

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
of pedal as guitar players we have to

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.440 
of pedal as guitar players we have to
admit<00:01:33.890> that<00:01:34.100> looks<00:01:34.460> are<00:01:34.700> really<00:01:35.030> important<00:01:35.360> as

on<00:02:04.520> a<00:02:04.550> product<00:02:04.940> and<00:02:05.150> I<00:02:05.720> just<00:02:06.530> started<00:02:07.100> out

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
on a product and I just started out

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.580 
on a product and I just started out
sketching<00:02:07.880> some<00:02:08.149> different<00:02:08.660> drawings<00:02:09.229> trying

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
sketching some different drawings trying

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.850 
sketching some different drawings trying
to<00:02:09.770> make<00:02:09.950> it<00:02:10.070> have<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:10.630> engravings<00:02:11.630> look<00:02:12.260> the

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
to make it have that engravings look the

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.670 
to make it have that engravings look the
first<00:02:13.660> drawing<00:02:14.660> off<00:02:15.760> of<00:02:16.760> this<00:02:16.910> Bach<00:02:17.120> mini<00:02:17.330> here

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
first drawing off of this Bach mini here

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.370 
first drawing off of this Bach mini here
telling<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.830> about<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.700> 22<00:02:20.090> B<00:02:20.209> boost<00:02:20.870> the

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
telling that about the 22 B boost the

discrete and on surface and true-bypass

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.570 
discrete and on surface and true-bypass
features<00:02:24.440> we<00:02:25.370> took<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.440> design<00:02:27.440> and<00:02:28.310> took<00:02:28.489> it

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
features we took the design and took it

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.440 
features we took the design and took it
into<00:02:28.820> 3d<00:02:29.290> did<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.440> colors<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.250> added<00:02:32.150> all<00:02:32.269> the

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
into 3d did the colors and added all the

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.870 
into 3d did the colors and added all the
all<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.170> details<00:02:33.530> and<00:02:33.830> added<00:02:34.190> a<00:02:34.250> decal

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
all the details and added a decal

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.840 
all the details and added a decal
just<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:36.709> make<00:02:36.860> sure<00:02:36.890> everything<00:02:37.550> fit

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
just to to make sure everything fit

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.340 
just to to make sure everything fit
because<00:02:38.239> it's<00:02:38.570> such<00:02:38.750> a<00:02:38.780> small<00:02:39.140> panel<00:02:44.350> coming

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
because it's such a small panel coming

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:46.780 
because it's such a small panel coming
up<00:02:45.530> with<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.769> idea<00:02:46.040> for<00:02:46.100> prime<00:02:46.400> time<00:02:46.430> was

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:46.790 
up with the idea for prime time was

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.040 
up with the idea for prime time was
really<00:02:47.030> a<00:02:47.060> matter<00:02:47.300> of<00:02:47.360> watching<00:02:47.570> guitar

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
really a matter of watching guitar

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.960 
really a matter of watching guitar
players<00:02:48.350> in<00:02:48.470> action<00:02:48.620> if<00:02:49.400> you<00:02:49.580> have<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.820> do<00:02:49.940> a

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
players in action if you have to do a

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.550 
players in action if you have to do a
short<00:02:50.300> solo<00:02:50.570> or<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.870> little<00:02:51.170> lick<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:51.440> you

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
short solo or a little lick that you

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.170 
short solo or a little lick that you
want<00:02:51.739> to<00:02:51.800> raise<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.130> volume<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.640> it's

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
want to raise the volume of it's

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.060 
want to raise the volume of it's
annoying<00:02:53.600> to<00:02:53.720> do<00:02:53.870> multiple<00:02:54.350> taps<00:02:54.590> on<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:54.830> foot

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
annoying to do multiple taps on the foot

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.550 
annoying to do multiple taps on the foot
switch<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:55.580> Peter<00:02:56.000> one<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.269> our<00:02:56.560> hardware

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 
switch so Peter one of our hardware

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.650 
switch so Peter one of our hardware
engineers<00:02:57.950> basically<00:02:58.700> said<00:02:58.910> well<00:02:59.540> why<00:02:59.630> don't

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660 
engineers basically said well why don't

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.420 
engineers basically said well why don't
we<00:02:59.840> just<00:03:00.019> make<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.350> foot<00:03:00.560> switch<00:03:00.739> work<00:03:01.220> as<00:03:01.400> a

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430 
we just make the foot switch work as a

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:03.160 
we just make the foot switch work as a
momentary<00:03:01.880> switch<00:03:02.090> if<00:03:02.390> you<00:03:02.540> hold<00:03:02.750> it<00:03:02.840> for<00:03:03.080> more

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
momentary switch if you hold it for more

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.690 
momentary switch if you hold it for more
than<00:03:03.230> a<00:03:03.350> second<00:03:03.739> when<00:03:04.130> you<00:03:04.220> release<00:03:04.489> it<00:03:04.519> again

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
than a second when you release it again

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.670 
than a second when you release it again
it's<00:03:05.209> off<00:03:05.450> and<00:03:05.690> it's<00:03:06.019> back<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.470> regular

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
it's off and it's back to a regular

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.340 
it's off and it's back to a regular
latching<00:03:07.190> switch<00:03:07.400> and<00:03:07.670> it<00:03:07.989> blew<00:03:08.989> our<00:03:09.140> minds

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
latching switch and it blew our minds

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.530 
latching switch and it blew our minds
it's<00:03:09.650> just<00:03:09.890> so<00:03:10.040> simple<00:03:10.459> but<00:03:11.030> it's<00:03:11.209> just<00:03:11.360> so

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
it's just so simple but it's just so

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:21.530 
it's just so simple but it's just so
perfect<00:03:11.780> and<00:03:12.110> it<00:03:12.230> works<00:03:12.410> great

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.059 

so<00:03:22.540> summing<00:03:22.840> up<00:03:23.050> the<00:03:23.200> essence<00:03:23.500> of<00:03:23.590> spark<00:03:23.890> mini

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
so summing up the essence of spark mini

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.870 
so summing up the essence of spark mini
gusta<00:03:24.490> it's<00:03:24.910> really<00:03:25.300> about<00:03:25.569> awesome<00:03:26.200> sounds

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
gusta it's really about awesome sounds

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.760 
gusta it's really about awesome sounds
simplicity<00:03:27.880> and<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.660> really<00:03:29.080> really<00:03:29.110> cool<00:03:29.530> look

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
simplicity and a really really cool look

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.860 
simplicity and a really really cool look
and<00:03:30.459> it's<00:03:30.670> a<00:03:30.730> kind<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:30.940> pedal<00:03:31.239> where<00:03:31.360> you<00:03:31.750> know

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
and it's a kind of pedal where you know

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.360 
and it's a kind of pedal where you know
no<00:03:32.050> matter<00:03:32.230> if<00:03:32.410> you<00:03:32.530> needed<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:32.980> raise<00:03:33.160> the

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
no matter if you needed to raise the

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.280 
no matter if you needed to raise the
volume<00:03:33.489> for<00:03:33.850> a<00:03:33.880> solo<00:03:34.180> or<00:03:34.510> you<00:03:34.690> want<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:34.989> take<00:03:35.200> it

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
volume for a solo or you want to take it

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.410 
volume for a solo or you want to take it
on<00:03:35.410> to<00:03:35.770> a<00:03:35.800> basically<00:03:36.489> an<00:03:36.640> extra<00:03:36.940> channel<00:03:37.209> to

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
on to a basically an extra channel to

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.790 
on to a basically an extra channel to
your<00:03:37.510> hand<00:03:37.690> or<00:03:37.870> just<00:03:37.900> have<00:03:38.170> it<00:03:38.260> on<00:03:38.319> all<00:03:38.590> the

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
your hand or just have it on all the

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.610 
your hand or just have it on all the
time<00:03:39.010> because<00:03:39.459> it<00:03:39.819> sounds<00:03:40.120> so<00:03:40.150> great<00:03:40.510> it<00:03:41.319> just

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
time because it sounds so great it just

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.350 
time because it sounds so great it just
works<00:03:41.860> for<00:03:42.010> all<00:03:42.280> these<00:03:42.459> different<00:03:42.700> purposes

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
works for all these different purposes

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.130 
works for all these different purposes
so<00:03:43.959> make<00:03:44.170> sure<00:03:44.200> you<00:03:44.470> check<00:03:44.709> it<00:03:44.830> out<00:03:44.950> now
