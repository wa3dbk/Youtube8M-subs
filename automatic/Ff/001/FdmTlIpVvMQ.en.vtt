00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.890
 white 2 in the multiplayer menu here 

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.410
 we have the options to choose local and 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.559
 I can not play online 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:15.019
 things that we have here, we can 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.260
 create us a class put box is what 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.330
 first thing I'm going to do is put bots 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.640
 and friends will put zero I will 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.619
 fight against everyone we put 9 and then 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.020
 we have the difficulty of wolves that we 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.170
 regular gardens veteran and rescue that 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:31.540
 the easiest for we have 1 2 3 and 4 and 7 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.610
 veterans and I like in the first 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:37.960
 starting we are going to put regular vale that 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:40.449
 I do not know how they are score after this seems 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.129
 that only the advantage is worth here puts down 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:44.970
 that I can have three so we're going to 

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:47.600
 choose will see us 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:51.140
 plane 5 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.809
 in the pooches these and the dragon fire 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.360
 So it is that I want the 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.100
 we have so we give a class worth 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.100
 here we have as you saw in others 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:04.399
 videos we have 10 10 holes to put 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.110
 here if we give it to below and above 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.409
 we are changing between different types of 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.659
 weapons I'm going to look for my mp7 here is 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:16.340
 also the first one is worth managing the 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.549
 amep exists for me the Japanese fire 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.549
 look 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.740
 that the sea ​​I put 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.060
 refers 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.920
 his prisoners 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:35.939
 stoke is that my English is a bit bad 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.939
 and the hilt 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.410
 the ballistic like that hits some wild 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.600
 cards here we have a kind of 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.670
 advantages are not the usual advantages 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.060
 but it's a kind of advantages we're going to 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.060
 put 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.500
 take a first weapon with a second motorbike 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.640
 weapon worth 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.780
 the mp7 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.840
 what the fuck happened 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.509
 I do not understand 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.090
 once it's gone, everything is like 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.240
 handle 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.310
 and secondary we will choose 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:17.310
 hit them more 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:20.459
 let's change us is that I my English 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.550
 I do not train, it's worth, I have 10 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:25.950
 worth it's worth this out and now when 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.300
 I can already choose another way the vector 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.940
 low is now yes 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.540
 run the first advantage to about 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.540
 we choose 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:40.600
 this to go faster 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.370
 here we have is that my English does not 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.540
 whole in water is not there it seems that 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.720
 I have strength and here as they are bots 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.480
 I'm going to get extreme conditioning 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.380
 it's lethal I usually use it 4 but 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.910
 I am going to try 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.110
 an axe 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.520
 and the tactic 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.740
 and here we are going to choose 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.690
 the grenades detect the enemies 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.070
 ok this is supposedly when 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.080
 explodes detects enemies 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.320
 I am going to choose me a conclusion of 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.030
 these are we worth and we can not get 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.640
 another thing is worth it since it would already have created 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:20.140
 the class and now they get to class 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.480
 queen of fucking mother 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:26.710
 now we choose to know 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.890
 capital letter is that I am d 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.870
 of playstation3 so there will be many 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.840
 times that you average with the buttons and you will see 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.890
 that you pomegranate something surely 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.890
 because whenever he plays another game
