00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
a little bag like this but I think these

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.620 
a little bag like this but I think these
are<00:01:33.049> absolutely<00:01:34.049> beautiful<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:35.420> these<00:01:36.420> are

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
our only two dollars and 45 cents so

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.760 
our only two dollars and 45 cents so
they're<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:39.420> expensive<00:01:39.930> at<00:01:40.229> all<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.530> guys
