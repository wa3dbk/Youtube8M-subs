different<00:01:19.750> plant<00:01:19.960> because<00:01:20.260> it<00:01:20.380> because<00:01:20.650> it

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
different plant because it because it

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.990 
different plant because it because it
has<00:01:20.860> a<00:01:20.890> similar<00:01:21.160> common<00:01:21.610> name<00:01:21.760> it's<00:01:21.970> a

different plant there's just one name
that's<00:01:24.160> why<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.400> use<00:01:24.790> the<00:01:24.910> latin<00:01:25.210> names<00:01:25.360> in<00:01:25.600> the

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690 
that's why I use the latin names in the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.090 
that's why I use the latin names in the
videos<00:01:25.990> why<00:01:26.200> i<00:01:26.230> choose<00:01:26.500> to<00:01:26.620> learn<00:01:26.740> them<00:01:26.920> just

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
videos why i choose to learn them just

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.770 
videos why i choose to learn them just
because<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:27.970> way<00:01:28.120> is<00:01:28.240> just<00:01:28.390> one<00:01:28.570> name<00:01:28.750> for

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
because that way is just one name for

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.140 
because that way is just one name for
the<00:01:29.080> plant<00:01:29.320> keeps<00:01:30.250> things<00:01:30.520> straighter<00:01:30.790> in<00:01:30.970> my

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:31.150 
the plant keeps things straighter in my

gonna make you sick the reason why this
plant<00:02:20.739> used<00:02:21.280> medicinally<00:02:21.849> is<00:02:21.910> because<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.569> the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
plant used medicinally is because of the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.830 
plant used medicinally is because of the
properties<00:02:23.709> it<00:02:24.220> has<00:02:24.250> and<00:02:24.760> eating<00:02:25.390> it<00:02:25.510> is<00:02:25.630> not

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
properties it has and eating it is not

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.540 
properties it has and eating it is not
one<00:02:26.050> of<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.769> reasons<00:02:27.069> why<00:02:27.190> it's<00:02:27.370> used

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
one of the reasons why it's used

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.339 
one of the reasons why it's used
medicinally<00:02:28.000> but<00:02:28.690> this<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:28.870> gonna<00:02:28.989> be<00:02:29.080> ripe

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
medicinally but this is gonna be ripe

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.229 
medicinally but this is gonna be ripe
here<00:02:29.860> in<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:30.010> little<00:02:30.220> bit<00:02:30.370> maybe<00:02:30.580> a<00:02:30.700> month<00:02:30.940> or<00:02:31.060> so

this size this is the fruit comes up at

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:45.270 
this size this is the fruit comes up at
this<00:02:43.630> or<00:02:43.870> a<00:02:43.930> bifurcates<00:02:44.470> and<00:02:44.739> it's<00:02:44.860> to<00:02:45.010> plant

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
this or a bifurcates and it's to plant

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.589 
this or a bifurcates and it's to plant
and<00:02:45.549> they're<00:02:45.700> shooting<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.090> two<00:02:46.239> leaves<00:02:46.420> come

know different than most spring or

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.160 
know different than most spring or
femorals<00:02:55.269> but<00:02:55.510> this<00:02:55.599> plant<00:02:55.810> is<00:02:55.959> used

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
specifically as a cell inhibitor it's

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.500 
specifically as a cell inhibitor it's
used<00:02:59.739> topically<00:03:00.160> some<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.000> the<00:03:01.060> derivatives

used topically some of the derivatives

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.930 
used topically some of the derivatives
is<00:03:01.720> use<00:03:01.840> Hockley<00:03:02.200> for<00:03:02.440> genital<00:03:02.769> warts<00:03:03.010> things

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
is use Hockley for genital warts things

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:05.550 
is use Hockley for genital warts things
like<00:03:04.120> that<00:03:04.329> if<00:03:04.569> you<00:03:04.720> are<00:03:04.900> gonna<00:03:05.140> if<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.349> would

the tulip tree down from the tule tree
layered<00:03:57.750> engine<00:03:58.049> I<00:03:58.140> believe<00:03:58.670> kind<00:03:59.670> of<00:03:59.760> cool<00:03:59.940> in

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
layered engine I believe kind of cool in

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.110 
layered engine I believe kind of cool in
the<00:04:00.090> ground<00:04:01.489> and<00:04:02.489> he<00:04:02.640> was<00:04:02.730> not<00:04:02.849> just<00:04:02.879> wandering

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
the ground and he was not just wandering

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.300 
the ground and he was not just wandering
I<00:04:03.330> just<00:04:03.450> want<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.629> reiterate<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:04.220> coming<00:04:05.220> out

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
I just want to reiterate that coming out

I just want to reiterate that coming out
in<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.430> forest<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.790> learning<00:04:06.060> as<00:04:06.150> much<00:04:06.269> as

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
in the forest and learning as much as

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.350 
in the forest and learning as much as
you<00:04:06.450> can<00:04:06.599> about<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.870> forest<00:04:07.670> just<00:04:08.670> keep<00:04:09.209> your

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 
you can about the forest just keep your

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.550 
you can about the forest just keep your
perspective<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:09.930> make<00:04:10.049> sure<00:04:10.230> that<00:04:10.409> you're

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
perspective and make sure that you're

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.110 
perspective and make sure that you're
not<00:04:10.680> always<00:04:10.920> looking<00:04:11.280> at<00:04:11.370> the<00:04:11.489> forest<00:04:11.730> of<00:04:11.909> what

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
not always looking at the forest of what

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.670 
not always looking at the forest of what
is<00:04:12.239> that<00:04:12.450> and<00:04:12.569> what<00:04:12.659> can<00:04:12.840> it<00:04:12.959> do<00:04:13.049> for<00:04:13.079> me<00:04:13.290> or<00:04:13.409> how

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
is that and what can it do for me or how

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.670 
is that and what can it do for me or how
can<00:04:13.890> I<00:04:14.040> use<00:04:14.310> that<00:04:14.549> is<00:04:15.540> this<00:04:15.900> perspective<00:04:16.410> I<00:04:16.500> try

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:16.680 
can I use that is this perspective I try

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.870 
can I use that is this perspective I try
to<00:04:16.739> keep<00:04:16.889> from<00:04:17.070> myself<00:04:17.220> when<00:04:17.459> I'm<00:04:17.639> out<00:04:17.729> in<00:04:17.760> the

forest is I really want to learn as much

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:21.710 
forest is I really want to learn as much
as<00:04:20.519> I<00:04:20.639> can<00:04:20.699> about<00:04:20.940> everything
