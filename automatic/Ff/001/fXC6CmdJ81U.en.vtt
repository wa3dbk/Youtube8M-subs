00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.140
 is it not OK? 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.560
 If you leave him 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.080
 is it not OK? 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.040
 If you leave him 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.620
 Can't I fill that empty space? 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.920
 Or you can choose to love that person 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.420
 It doesn't matter 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.880
 As long as you are by my side, 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.460
 Think of your tired face 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.040
 Although I met with you who have been heartbroken for you for a long time. 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.300
 I see you who can't love you. 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.240
 My painful heart will fall down 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.820
 is it not OK? 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.800
 Love me 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.700
 Can't you read my heart? 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.800
 Or can imagine me as that person 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:19.780
 As long as you are by my side
