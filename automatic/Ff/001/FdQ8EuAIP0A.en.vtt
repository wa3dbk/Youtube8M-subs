00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
getting close to that pivot point where

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.410 
getting close to that pivot point where
the<00:03:12.010> shoulder<00:03:12.400> dart<00:03:12.640> is<00:03:12.880> and<00:03:13.090> this<00:03:13.180> is<00:03:13.300> the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
center of the dart make sure that

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.420 
center of the dart make sure that
