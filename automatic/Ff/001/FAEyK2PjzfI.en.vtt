00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.620
 More than 6000 spectators found their way into the 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:14.199
 Baunatal park stadium to relax with 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:17.740
 expected local derby the ksv 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:19.570
 baunatal and the ksv hessen kassel 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.490
 even before the start of the game were the roles 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.950
 clearly distributes the baunataler than 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.110
 Tables fifteen boys as underdog 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.030
 in the match against the neighbor 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:29.920
 kassel which after last three 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.649
 unbeaten play in the top 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.390
 table thirds consolidate the wool 

00:00:32.649 --> 00:00:37.030
 baunataler showed up from the beginning 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.670
 absolutely equal from the favorites 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.450
 Kassel was not much up to 24 minutes 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.120
 to see 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:45.850
 The wide high ball then finds the 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.059
 power to benjamin is the switch 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.059
 to let 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.350
 shortly afterwards freestoss on the other 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.750
 side that is tobias becker the point 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.530
 now flat kevin rough hat is back to the 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.210
 set and clear the ball 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.600
 the game rippled a bit afterwards 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:07.000
 now the lions can raise the ball 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:09.640
 do not control that is the far 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.700
 ball to andreas pollasch and he makes 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.600
 him the much acclaimed 1 0 for the 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.330
 outsider 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.509
 with his first goal of the season and that 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.460
 just in the local derby that was 1 0 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.940
 at the same time the break 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.940
 on 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.780
 both teams came unchanged from the 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.340
 Cabin of the ksv hessen kassel had as 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.530
 favorit of course react and 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.660
 tried to fight into the game 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.900
 eckball from the left side in sharp 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:44.960
 and hartmann distracts from the feet of 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.280
 will benjamin dürr with the fast 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.290
 compensation for the guests 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.290
 at the same time it is his fourth season goal 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.480
 the baunatal lapped trainer tobias 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.850
 Nebe is not shocked by that 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.760
 is christian kattner who leaves the 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.290
 half defense of the lions standing and flanking 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.990
 in the middle of the ball first clarified 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.160
 and from the background felix shoots 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.160
 shepherd gümbel 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.890
 now the kasseler are back at the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.050
 row after the far tee blends in 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.970
 bekteshi nicely into the game and 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.900
 served the substitute tobias dam 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.299
 and the tried fails but has 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.489
 The lions came gradually into the ride and 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.409
 continued to set the pressure free kick for 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:44.819
 the kasseler again comes the ball 

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:46.920
 Hochrhein is weggeköpft and moves out 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.870
 the distant breathe lets bounce off and off 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.840
 applies dusty 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.700
 benjamin money is at the right time 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.379
 right place already be second 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.379
 hit of the evening 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.790
 the springer in the 84 minute the guests 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.400
 out of kassel determine that happen 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.510
 but so far could not for the 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.400
 make a decision 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.050
 maybe now in the lions 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.060
 Advance to fast 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.310
 combination football the lap and 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:22.099
 again the leather goes into the arms of 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:25.160
 hain two minutes later the homeowners 

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:26.000
 desperately try close to the penalty area 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.709
 get 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.290
 the pass goes to the wrong man and then 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:33.560
 It goes away very quickly because she is from 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.290
 substitutes enrico gaede sent 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:39.049
 who fails with a long solo 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.450
 but again there is benjamin dürr already 

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:44.560
 For the second time dust is allowed and cares 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.560
 with it for the decision 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.800
 At the end of the ksv could hessen 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.610
 kassel a 3-1 away win in 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:03.260
 celebrate northern hessen derby 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.770
 against initial difficulties against 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.410
 the courageous Baunataler won 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:15.590
 the favor finally finally 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:17.540
 confidently say in right 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.799
 but then gone 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.180
 come back outside and I think 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:22.520
 was clearly the dominant team and 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.680
 in the end they do not tell us your 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.810
 names of my ice cold used by the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.070
 I think so too 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.380
 I think we have two halves 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:33.470
 seen better than something heavy 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.540
 finally checked very little behind 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.910
 Standards would come up front 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.020
 put two three huge possibilities 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.690
 would have had to do one more 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.340
 believed comfortable will be for 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.900
 the first really hard and yes then 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.400
 we take in the whole halftime 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.870
 correspond to that four degrees 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.850
 further measured gas does not subside 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.080
 We should be off his first ten minutes 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.260
 especially bitter that it is against us 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:03.020
 of course, of course, go of the 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:03.680
 performance demolition then said 846 came 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.000
 not me anymore 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.000
 not just a game
