00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
your RO water really helps raise and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.469 
your RO water really helps raise and

the flow valve at the end of the blue

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.250 
the flow valve at the end of the blue
tube<00:02:32.310> and<00:02:32.580> let<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.030> run<00:02:33.150> for<00:02:33.360> about<00:02:33.450> 30<00:02:33.810> to<00:02:33.989> 40

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
minutes before collecting any water it

minutes before collecting any water it
hmm<00:02:37.230> just<00:02:37.620> a<00:02:37.800> dribble<00:02:38.640> is<00:02:38.730> coming<00:02:39.060> out<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.239> the

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
hmm just a dribble is coming out of the

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.300 
hmm just a dribble is coming out of the
blue<00:02:39.510> tube<00:02:39.720> I<00:02:39.840> mean<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.260> should<00:02:40.560> see<00:02:40.830> three

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
blue tube I mean you should see three

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.370 
blue tube I mean you should see three
times<00:02:41.550> as<00:02:41.790> much<00:02:41.940> waste<00:02:42.269> as<00:02:42.450> purified<00:02:43.170> water

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
times as much waste as purified water

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.070 
times as much waste as purified water
but<00:02:43.680> this<00:02:44.099> looks<00:02:44.340> like<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:44.519> lot<00:02:44.790> more<00:02:44.819> a<00:02:45.269> quick

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
but this looks like a lot more a quick

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:48.229 
but this looks like a lot more a quick
check<00:02:46.290> out<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.500> water<00:02:46.680> pressure<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.310> haha

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
check out the water pressure and haha

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.390 
check out the water pressure and haha
okay<00:02:48.660> that's<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.440> problem<00:02:49.470> look<00:02:49.920> I<00:02:50.100> mean<00:02:50.220> it's

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
okay that's the problem look I mean it's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.660 
okay that's the problem look I mean it's
just<00:02:50.580> 20<00:02:51.030> psi<00:02:51.330> we<00:02:51.959> need<00:02:52.110> at<00:02:52.230> least<00:02:52.260> 40<00:02:53.130> max<00:02:53.459> of

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
just 20 psi we need at least 40 max of

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.940 
just 20 psi we need at least 40 max of
125<00:02:54.450> now<00:02:55.019> this<00:02:55.200> is<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.380> common<00:02:55.799> problem

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
125 now this is a common problem

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.890 
125 now this is a common problem
especially<00:02:56.310> if<00:02:56.970> your<00:02:57.090> RO<00:02:57.330> machine<00:02:57.780> is

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
especially if your RO machine is

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.140 
especially if your RO machine is
installed<00:02:58.080> on<00:02:58.530> an<00:02:58.650> upper<00:02:59.010> floor<00:02:59.040> or<00:02:59.549> an<00:02:59.700> addict

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
installed on an upper floor or an addict

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.600 
installed on an upper floor or an addict
so<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.690> solution<00:03:01.200> is<00:03:01.350> an<00:03:01.709> inline<00:03:02.190> pressure

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
so the solution is an inline pressure

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.699 
so the solution is an inline pressure
booster<00:03:03.090> pump<00:03:03.330> now<00:03:03.840> these<00:03:04.049> are<00:03:04.319> sold

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
booster pump now these are sold

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.410 
booster pump now these are sold
separately<00:03:05.220> it<00:03:05.400> comes<00:03:05.430> with<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.819> power<00:03:06.090> pack

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
separately it comes with a power pack

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.300 
separately it comes with a power pack
and<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.870> pressure<00:03:07.080> switch<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:07.709> bear<00:03:08.040> in<00:03:08.069> mind

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
and a pressure switch so bear in mind

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.250 
and a pressure switch so bear in mind
that<00:03:08.519> if<00:03:08.610> you<00:03:08.700> go<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:09.120> route<00:03:09.360> you'll<00:03:09.930> need<00:03:10.140> an

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
that if you go this route you'll need an

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.350 
that if you go this route you'll need an
electrical<00:03:10.709> socket<00:03:10.890> nearby<00:03:11.430> connect<00:03:12.269> the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
electrical socket nearby connect the

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.780 
electrical socket nearby connect the
