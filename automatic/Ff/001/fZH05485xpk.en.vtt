00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:07.560
 Well I will teach you how to make the point 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.020
 from Malta 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.480
 that has a bit of difficulty in the 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.160
 second round but it's a matter of 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.719
 try it a couple of times and it comes out is not 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.430
 It is not very difficult what happens is that 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.310
 instructions are usually very complicated 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:24.359
 down here you can see it between two 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.009
 moss stitch turns that good if 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.749
 It is made in pearl or in another color 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:30.210
 clearer but that is how it is less defined 

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:32.099
 that if it is done between two rounds of 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.070
 smooth but good point I show you both 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.810
 so you will see them 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.390
 the first round that is made by the 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:40.910
 right side is very easy is 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.030
 simply work the entire round 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:47.600
 of the right this is my shore point and 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.420
 this is my second shore point 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.449
 and now let's work the rest 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.309
 casting the thread twice are points 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.309
 of the right but with two strands 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.010
 and there are some instructions 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.780
 that instead of throwing two strands is in 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.070
 the first strand and then make the point 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.540
 normal 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.360
 evra and normal point I like more and 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.180
 I find it more comfortable to throw 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.090
 two strands but it's a matter of taste and 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.430
 nothing will do and it simply repeats itself 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.470
 the end of the turn and then now you 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.480
 I teach how to do it on the reverse 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.430
 in the backhand turn is where 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.870
 really going to work the point of 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.200
 give it shape you have to remember to do 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.880
 the first two points with which 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.880
 you have from the reverse side 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.390
 and now it is carried to the back thread 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.390
 because we are going to work from the right 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.270
 It is taken three to three 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.980
 take the first point and undo those 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:07.670
 two strands that we have thrown 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.009
 points and three points 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.250
 now with the left needle are taken 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:15.420
 the three together 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.760
 and they move 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.340
 and with the right they take the three 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.590
 together again to do those of the 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.069
 straight 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:28.580
 and we are going to work three points here the 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.019
 first of the right they are not changed from 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.940
 needles is given a small pull with the 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.450
 right needle to give you a little bit of 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.250
 slack 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.250
 the open is brought forward 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.080
 and again a point of the right 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.080
 and there you see 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.870
 1 2 and 3 points that we have taken from those 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.860
 3 points we have made and now 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.050
 it simply repeats until the end 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.020
 it falls apart 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:03.130
 2 rids 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.620
 and 3 undoes with the left like that 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.130
 and as they are you do not have to change anything 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:14.280
 move to the left needle 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.280
 with the right they are taken together 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.930
 a point of the right is made 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.140
 I have stayed there 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.170
 they are taken together it is made from the right it 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:31.720
 it gives a little slack 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.319
 the strand is brought forward 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.910
 it does 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:41.930
 again the three together of the right 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:43.990
 of line so they are released and again 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.640
 one 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.560
 two 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.700
 and here we have reached one of those 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:54.610
 points that I made before throwing the thread 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:56.260
 the strand is taken and released 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.820
 and you will see later that it is exactly 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.820
 just one way or the other 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:06.040
 needle 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.040
 they take the three together 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:10.390
 the point of the right a little bit of 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.730
 slack 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.459
 the strand forward 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:18.609
 and here you have to hold it like everyone else 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:21.120
 better can because sometimes they run away and 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:24.109
 it is done again 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.109
 how it escapes me 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.760
 a point 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.370
 right they are released 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.050
 and again you have to let go of this one of the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.090
 that they had strand forward you have to drop 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.460
 the point and the strand 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.290
 here the same the point of the strand and 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.600
 stars of which we have done with two 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.010
 threads 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.010
 they change their needle 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:56.080
 the first point of the right a little bit 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:58.360
 of slack the strand forward 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.870
 and again 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.460
 point of the right and they let go and here already 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.280
 we have reached the last 1 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.150
 two 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:12.190
 3 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.009
 they change their needle 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:17.700
 they take the three together 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.560
 point of the right 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.280
 I have taken a thread that I do not 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.280
 corresponds 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.970
 of the right 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:28.970
 ebro forward 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.570
 right point and they let go and now 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:38.240
 as it is the backhand turn we bring the 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:40.289
 of grace in front to make the points 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.189
 from shore 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:43.189
 Reverse 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.160
 and it is already 

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.910
 why 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.640
 you can see 

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:54.650
 as it comes out now it is very tight 

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.020
 because all three are the points 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.430
 grouped in threes but doing 

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:01.670
 the next turn of the right and the 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:05.000
 next upside down I know 

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:08.500
 are equal and left point and as 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.500
 it has to stay and that 's it
