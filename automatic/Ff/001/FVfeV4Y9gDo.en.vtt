okay<00:00:01.290> I<00:00:01.620> thought<00:00:02.220> I'd<00:00:02.370> do<00:00:02.610> a<00:00:02.639> video<00:00:02.909> about<00:00:03.240> the

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
okay I thought I'd do a video about the

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.280 
okay I thought I'd do a video about the
six-pack<00:00:04.730> carburetors<00:00:05.730> I<00:00:06.509> get<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.049> lot<00:00:07.259> of

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
six-pack carburetors I get a lot of

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.160 
six-pack carburetors I get a lot of
questions<00:00:07.680> about<00:00:07.830> these<00:00:08.309> at<00:00:09.300> car<00:00:09.570> shows<00:00:09.599> and

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
questions about these at car shows and

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.999 
questions about these at car shows and
so<00:00:10.290> forth<00:00:10.620> that's<00:00:11.630> kind<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:13.380> jewelry<00:00:13.980> of

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
so forth that's kind of the jewelry of

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.480 
so forth that's kind of the jewelry of
engines<00:00:14.759> if<00:00:15.000> you<00:00:15.240> think<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.350> way<00:00:16.680> but

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
engines if you think of it that way but

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.830 
engines if you think of it that way but
this<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.880> 440<00:00:18.779> six-pack<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.859> in<00:00:20.220> a<00:00:20.840> 69

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840

originally the kick down assembly is not
the<00:00:53.579> same<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.120> they<00:00:54.989> do<00:00:55.050> make<00:00:55.350> these<00:00:55.530> you<00:00:56.010> know

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the same and they do make these you know

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.720 
the same and they do make these you know
like<00:00:56.489> your<00:00:56.699> won<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.149> forth<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.410> is

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
like your won and so forth and it is

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.549 
like your won and so forth and it is
different<00:00:59.730> going<00:01:00.420> down<00:01:00.600> through<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.530> the

different going down through to the
sudden<00:01:02.070> 27<00:01:02.609> transmission<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.420> got<00:01:03.539> a

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
sudden 27 transmission if you got a

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.950 
sudden 27 transmission if you got a
manual<00:01:03.930> obviously<00:01:04.559> this<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.890> irrelevant

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:05.960 
manual obviously this is irrelevant

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.969 
manual obviously this is irrelevant
these<00:01:07.820> mechanical<00:01:09.530> components<00:01:10.530> go<00:01:10.650> into<00:01:10.890> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
these mechanical components go into the

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.920 
these mechanical components go into the
outboard<00:01:11.400> carburetors<00:01:12.090> these<00:01:12.299> actually<00:01:12.689> hold

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
outboard carburetors these actually hold

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
outboard carburetors these actually hold
the<00:01:13.890> carbs<00:01:14.250> shut<00:01:15.830> when<00:01:16.830> you're<00:01:17.009> running<00:01:17.430> on

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
the carbs shut when you're running on

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.499 
the carbs shut when you're running on
just<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.119> single<00:01:18.420> carb<00:01:19.880> fuel<00:01:20.880> capacity<00:01:21.060> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
just a single carb fuel capacity and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.410 
just a single carb fuel capacity and
stroke<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:22.290> forth<00:01:22.590> you've<00:01:22.920> got<00:01:23.100> a<00:01:23.130> 350<00:01:23.850> CFM

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
stroke so forth you've got a 350 CFM

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.660 
stroke so forth you've got a 350 CFM
Center<00:01:25.320> carb<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.740> you're<00:01:25.890> running<00:01:25.979> on<00:01:26.280> when

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
Center carb that you're running on when

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.969 
Center carb that you're running on when
you're<00:01:26.820> just<00:01:27.270> putting<00:01:27.450> around<00:01:27.780> town<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.920> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
you're just putting around town if you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.660 
you're just putting around town if you
kick<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.400> in<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:30.000> get<00:01:30.210> an<00:01:30.900> extra<00:01:31.290> 500<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.280> each

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
kick it in you get an extra 500 in each

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.230 
kick it in you get an extra 500 in each
your<00:01:33.030> front<00:01:33.360> and<00:01:33.509> rear<00:01:34.520> outboard<00:01:35.520> carburetors

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
your front and rear outboard carburetors

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.600 
your front and rear outboard carburetors
so<00:01:36.810> you're<00:01:36.960> talking<00:01:37.110> about<00:01:37.350> if<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.490> doing

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
so you're talking about if you're doing

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.399 
so you're talking about if you're doing
math<00:01:38.880> at<00:01:39.090> home<00:01:39.270> it's<00:01:39.570> thirteen<00:01:39.960> hundred<00:01:40.350> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
math at home it's thirteen hundred and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.230 
math at home it's thirteen hundred and
fifty<00:01:40.799> CFM's<00:01:41.450> that<00:01:42.450> gives<00:01:42.720> you<00:01:42.840> an<00:01:42.930> idea<00:01:43.079> of

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 
fifty CFM's that gives you an idea of

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.969 
fifty CFM's that gives you an idea of
amount<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.390> air<00:01:45.540> and<00:01:45.869> gas<00:01:46.079> going<00:01:46.500> down<00:01:46.680> through

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
amount of air and gas going down through

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.460 
amount of air and gas going down through
there<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.250> yes<00:01:47.610> you<00:01:48.240> actually<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.899> see<00:01:49.140> your

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
there and yes you actually can see your

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.149 
there and yes you actually can see your
gas<00:01:50.100> gauge<00:01:50.369> twitch<00:01:51.590> but<00:01:52.590> there's<00:01:52.770> no<00:01:52.920> sound

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
gas gauge twitch but there's no sound

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.660 
gas gauge twitch but there's no sound
quite<00:01:53.490> like<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:55.219> gives<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> sense

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
quite like it and it gives you the sense

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.219 
quite like it and it gives you the sense
that<00:01:56.790> maybe<00:01:57.090> you're<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.509> pull<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.930> hood

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
that maybe you're going to pull the hood

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.730 
that maybe you're going to pull the hood
right<00:01:58.469> right<00:01:59.040> through<00:01:59.280> your<00:01:59.460> air<00:01:59.549> cleaner<00:02:00.740> on

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
right right through your air cleaner on

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.999 
right right through your air cleaner on
this<00:02:01.950> side<00:02:02.189> a<00:02:02.610> little<00:02:02.969> more<00:02:03.329> crowded<00:02:04.020> show<00:02:04.860> up

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
this side a little more crowded show up

this side a little more crowded show up
show<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.549> couple<00:02:05.909> things<00:02:05.939> here<00:02:07.009> these

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
show you a couple things here these
