00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:04.540
 how about friends as strangers of vigo in 2009 19 I'll show you how 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.690
 I trust 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.919
 the microphone correctly 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.980
 meeting was meant to say what a lot of attention is not a very well process 

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:15.669
 it was difficult to attend the first thing we will do will be input 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.560
 first will connect our 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.199
 Weigh meter with it when we have it connected and they are not nothing 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.449
 we would do if we made the control panel min 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.159
 I will not repeat control panel 

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:32.819
 who currently controls and cleans sound device and another 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.910
 in the box 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.190
 there is a 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.430
 because if you believe in God 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.130
 so 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.280
 p 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.510
 We came between the Cuban capital 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.520
 but next and that's what we had 1 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.579
 a part second serve will finish loading three 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.480
 as undetermined to load the test and if our microphone was correct 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:36.840
 maybe everything 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.840
 PS should move the sound bar 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.440
 so that microphone area cynically so if you clemente 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.060
 you would say those words while they have your microphone 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.770
 while they have their microphone and be silly delta the next day and the 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.700
 perfectly recognized good microphone 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.750
 i do not even adding that it's the most common because the microphone so 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.330
 general is disabled from comuto we would simply double click on it 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.420
 icon of this volume 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.789
 but in this case I have activated but you simply next year 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.839
 percent we would go to 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:15.809
 options 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:19.089
 and in properties and here they would activate the microphone 

00:02:19.669 --> 00:02:21.289
 ankara as you can see 

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:24.759
 would activate it iberia is not 

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:27.819
 in advanced options simply 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:29.169
 happy day of 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.169
 If I did not continue adding, I would choose advanced options 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.319
 they would give him pavlik microphone option 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.339
 here they would give him a microphone application and they would give 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.149
 they met serra would do and already their microphone should be correctly 

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:53.650
 configured installed on your computer so do not forget that 

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:57.819
