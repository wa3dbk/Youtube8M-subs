and<00:01:49.990> so<00:01:50.890> if<00:01:51.159> you're<00:01:51.340> going<00:01:51.580> somewhere<00:01:51.880> dark

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
and so if you're going somewhere dark

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.139 
and so if you're going somewhere dark
and<00:01:52.570> you<00:01:52.810> need<00:01:53.110> to<00:01:53.289> really<00:01:53.710> amp<00:01:54.100> it<00:01:54.729> off<00:01:54.850> you

need to make it look a little bit

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:58.680 
need to make it look a little bit
creepier<00:01:56.710> because<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:57.159> can't<00:01:57.429> tell<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:58.569> know

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690
