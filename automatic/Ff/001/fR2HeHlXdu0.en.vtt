easy steps to test diamonds home to help

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.580 
easy steps to test diamonds home to help
you<00:00:29.760> know<00:00:29.939> if<00:00:30.090> you<00:00:30.269> have<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> real<00:00:30.779> diamond<00:00:31.109> or

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
you know if you have a real diamond or

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.520 
you know if you have a real diamond or
not<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.520> first<00:00:32.820> step<00:00:33.270> to<00:00:33.480> do<00:00:33.690> is<00:00:33.960> called<00:00:34.320> the

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
not the first step to do is called the

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.470 
not the first step to do is called the
warmth<00:00:35.070> test<00:00:36.110> or<00:00:37.399> what<00:00:38.399> I<00:00:38.430> prefer<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.120> name<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
warmth test or what I prefer to name the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.990 
warmth test or what I prefer to name the
breathing<00:00:39.870> test

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:41.000 
breathing test

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.779 
breathing test
okay<00:00:42.000> diamonds<00:00:42.629> basically<00:00:43.230> do<00:00:43.379> not<00:00:43.649> hold<00:00:44.399> heat

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
okay diamonds basically do not hold heat

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.479 
okay diamonds basically do not hold heat
so<00:00:45.420> any<00:00:45.600> heat<00:00:45.840> they<00:00:46.079> get<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.920> also<00:00:47.129> is

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
so any heat they get in it also is

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.790 
so any heat they get in it also is
instantly<00:00:48.120> getting<00:00:48.329> out<00:00:48.600> if<00:00:48.899> you<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.590> lab

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
instantly getting out if you have a lab

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.639 
instantly getting out if you have a lab
created<00:00:50.370> Diamont<00:00:51.030> or<00:00:51.120> another<00:00:51.930> gem<00:00:52.320> or<00:00:52.590> a

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
created Diamont or another gem or a

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:58.670 
created Diamont or another gem or a
zircon<00:00:53.550> stone<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.719> will<00:00:54.960> retain<00:00:55.350> heat<00:00:57.680> making

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
zircon stone it will retain heat making

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.420 
zircon stone it will retain heat making
it<00:00:59.250> up<00:00:59.960> now<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.289> your<00:01:01.530> diamond<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.129> real

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
it up now if your diamond is real

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.729 
it up now if your diamond is real
and<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.210> breathing<00:01:03.420> test<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.290> will<00:01:04.500> know

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
and do the breathing test you will know

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.550 
and do the breathing test you will know
that<00:01:04.769> diamond<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.939> real<00:01:06.180> since<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.229> will<00:01:07.380> not

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
that diamond is real since it will not

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.440 
that diamond is real since it will not
fog<00:01:07.860> up<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:09.979> so<00:01:10.979> I'm<00:01:11.250> gonna<00:01:11.490> go<00:01:11.790> ahead<00:01:11.939> here<00:01:12.390> and

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
fog up up so I'm gonna go ahead here and

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.039 
fog up up so I'm gonna go ahead here and
actually<00:01:12.990> exhale<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.310> my<00:01:14.820> diamonds<00:01:15.330> to<00:01:15.900> make

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
actually exhale on my diamonds to make

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.740 
actually exhale on my diamonds to make
sure<00:01:18.020> it's<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.259> genuine<00:01:19.770> diamond<00:01:20.100> okay

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
sure it's a genuine diamond okay

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.650 
sure it's a genuine diamond okay
it<00:01:22.290> did<00:01:22.560> not<00:01:23.070> us<00:01:23.310> if<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.390> pick<00:01:24.630> a

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:24.660 
it did not us if I pick a

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.440 
it did not us if I pick a
lab-created<00:01:25.100> diamund<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.280> exhale<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.300> it

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
lab-created diamund and exhale on it

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.390 
lab-created diamund and exhale on it
also<00:01:28.050> it<00:01:28.380> will<00:01:28.950> up<00:01:30.860> so<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:32.130> is<00:01:32.280> an

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
also it will up so that is an

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.130 
also it will up so that is an
indication<00:01:32.550> that<00:01:33.240> your<00:01:33.479> diamond<00:01:33.690> is<00:01:34.080> not

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
indication that your diamond is not

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.790 
indication that your diamond is not
genuine<00:01:34.800> and<00:01:35.070> that<00:01:35.310> is<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> fake<00:01:35.729> diamond<00:01:36.800> now

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
genuine and that is a fake diamond now

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.400 
genuine and that is a fake diamond now
there's<00:01:38.130> another<00:01:38.369> way<00:01:38.640> we<00:01:38.670> can<00:01:39.060> test<00:01:39.300> this<00:01:39.690> to

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:40.410 
there's another way we can test this to

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.380 
there's another way we can test this to
discover<00:01:40.830> if<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.160> diamond<00:01:41.640> is<00:01:41.790> real<00:01:42.000> or<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:44.390> put

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
discover if a diamond is real or not put

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.170 
discover if a diamond is real or not put
it<00:01:45.510> under<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> microscope<00:01:45.900> or<00:01:46.800> use<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.310> 10<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.880> 12

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
it under a microscope or use a 10 to 12

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.680 
it under a microscope or use a 10 to 12
times<00:01:48.540> jeweler's<00:01:49.140> loupe<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:50.510> microscope<00:01:51.510> a

okay a loupe is really cheap you have to

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.749 
okay a loupe is really cheap you have to
know<00:02:00.990> lab-created<00:02:01.580> diamonds<00:02:04.310> do<00:02:05.310> not<00:02:05.550> have

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
know lab-created diamonds do not have

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.359 
know lab-created diamonds do not have
any<00:02:05.910> inclusions<00:02:06.690> or<00:02:06.869> imperfections<00:02:07.830> inside

enlarging glass or if you have good eyes
okay<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.780> test<00:02:30.959> you<00:02:31.200> do<00:02:31.350> is<00:02:31.530> look<00:02:31.709> into<00:02:31.920> the

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
okay the test you do is look into the
