00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
that comes close to a reg rock but then

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.730 
that comes close to a reg rock but then
again<00:03:53.460> you<00:03:53.730> know<00:03:53.880> it<00:03:54.060> only<00:03:54.270> for<00:03:54.630> that<00:03:54.780> until

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
again you know it only for that until

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.650 
again you know it only for that until
they<00:03:55.950> switch<00:03:56.340> out<00:03:56.580> but<00:03:56.910> it's<00:03:57.180> truly<00:03:57.600> a

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 
they switch out but it's truly a

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.250 
they switch out but it's truly a
remarkable<00:03:57.930> Pokemon<00:03:58.770> path<00:03:59.070> and<00:03:59.760> yeah<00:04:00.480> so<00:04:00.930> it

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.260 
remarkable Pokemon path and yeah so it

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:03.380 
remarkable Pokemon path and yeah so it
