00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.589
 Hello such friends today what 

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:09.770
 I will do is turn this lamp 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:13.250
 led white light on a led lamp 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.880
 of black or ultraviolet light as I'm going 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:15.880
 to show here 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.710
 of this tone 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.529
 ok the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.770
 remove what is the opposite 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.850
 for this we can hear this 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.260
 the batteries and we're going to push from 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.030
 inside out 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.030
 until it comes out what is this part 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.359
 in this case I already know I did it with 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.359
 This lamp 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:01:01.640
 how it came 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.640
 it has nothing here are the leds 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.480
 There are nine LEDs in total 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.270
 white light LEDs 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.789
 ok what are we going to do 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.180
 is to look at the polarity of our 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:21.150
 leds 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.150
 and start dismantling them with a soldering iron 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.820
 Y 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.190
 ah 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.180
 since we have all the leds 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:28.430
 disassembled we will have the plate 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.329
 to reassemble our LEDs 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.329
 ultraviolet 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.670
 in this case we are going to 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.209
 To cut our LEDs to the size 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.209
 suitable 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.940
 A) Yes 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.610
 we are going to remove all the welding that is 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:09.830
 can stay like this in this way what 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.830
 what is the circuit board 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.849
 and now we are going to proceed to assemble 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.849
 our leds 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.010
 with its respective polarity 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.280
 what I'm doing is when 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.550
 put the led 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.130
 I open a little bit what the legs are 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:48.180
 led 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:50.780
 so that it does not get out of what is the 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.780
 circuit 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:58.180
 in this way we can insure the LEDs 

00:03:54.689 --> 00:04:02.200
 and they will not come out at the time of welding 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.870
 we have all the LEDs now 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.719
 let's proceed to solder let's 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.290
 rectify that all the LEDs are 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.290
 rights 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.930
 they are not Swedish 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.470
 so what I'm going to do is put it in 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:23.239
 the table 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.239
 and rectify that they are well 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.979
 once this is done I will proceed to 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.979
 Weld 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.140
 we already have every soldier 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.560
 correctly with the respective 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:02.120
 polarity now I'm going to put the spring 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.120
 in the largest part 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:45.539
 very careful not to touch the 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:50.580
 Other led end of led leg 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:54.110
 that would be the negative current this 

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.110
 it would be positive current 

00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:06.160
 for what I 'm going to do is proceed to 

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:06.160
 put the leds 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.530
 ah 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:24.280
 Y 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.280
 ready 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:32.879
 is correctly placed 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.940
 let's notice the plastic that follows 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:51.970
 ok I inserted it to pressure what is the 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.970
 plate with leds 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:57.480
 the plastic that comes here 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:07:00.020
 now let's proceed to put the 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.020
 batteries 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:18.309
 I'm going to turn off the light to show it to 5 

00:07:47.319 --> 00:07:55.629
 I hope you liked it, do not forget 

00:07:50.839 --> 00:07:55.629
