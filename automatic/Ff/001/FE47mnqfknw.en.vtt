00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
one of the biggest challenges has to be

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.530 
one of the biggest challenges has to be
just<00:00:38.110> not<00:00:38.290> breaking<00:00:38.710> down<00:00:38.920> physically<00:00:39.580> yeah

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
aspect but you never can prepare for the

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.320 
aspect but you never can prepare for the
kind<00:00:46.570> of<00:00:46.659> mental<00:00:46.960> strain<00:00:47.199> that<00:00:47.379> goes<00:00:47.559> on

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
kind of mental strain that goes on

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.219 
kind of mental strain that goes on
especially<00:00:49.330> when<00:00:49.420> you<00:00:49.540> do<00:00:49.690> something<00:00:49.809> strange
