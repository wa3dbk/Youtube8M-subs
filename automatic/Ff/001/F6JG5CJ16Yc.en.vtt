00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.820
 hello people and welcome to one 

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.450
 new episode six play fifa 30 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.010
 career mode ios goes on we have 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.809
 yes the hamburg part one behind 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.300
 and now hamburg is part 2 against 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.250
 the hsv yes as I said a bit 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.260
 special game and something funny that 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.990
 it comes to this constellation yes 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.119
 typical turrets yes hamburg went that 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.580
 is quite interesting Jahn Regensburg 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.750
 against hamburger sv that is a hit 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.230
 which is not really at eye level 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.320
 is the first division against second division on 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.770
 tomorrow table straight on place 7 must 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.860
 so it is quite good in contrast to 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.540
 real life but nevertheless 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.879
 of course we want to win though 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.520
 it's just as hard to say 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.440
 that might still sound like one 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.570
 small feasible task because we 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.879
 just have a run and who knows who 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.530
 I know what else will happen 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.840
 jump was equal to the game in 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.910
 the first interesting scene the 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.550
 of course from the hamburger sv which dominates 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.739
 the first 20 minutes brought these 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.930
 good flank in jansen marveled wool 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.210
 hofmann clarifies hofmann again with the 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.380
 double parade and thus direct even the 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.020
 counter a patrick hag that 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:15.119
 pointed mayer among which plus the current 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.770
 but the ball spills but January 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.369
 innsbruck relies then comes female 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.509
 and between and he makes the thing in 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.270
 ingenious not at all good 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.549
 at this shot from 4.30 am 104 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.350
 years , the second division will be bad 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.630
 made by eagle here and because i am 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.460
 there suits already and that from the 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.110
 turn right down right in 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.689
 so fast can go next chance 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.159
 kotzke and there is rein the power makes it 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.159
 again and here but does not look good 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.560
 determining from the 2 0 15 minutes 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.869
 And that makes Regensburg a whole whole 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.670
 big step forward and with 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.680
 This gate in the footnote also changes 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.390
 the first half wonderful shot though 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.270
 it just does not look good to two 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.460
 zero so at half-time determined here with 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.140
 its double it can only 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.180
 go on like this if you look years old 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.200
 Regensburg the game looks but 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.820
 Let's take a look at the second half 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.530
 in 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.930
 there comes roadmaps and that is actually 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.160
 a foul and actually too 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.709
 eleven figure sharif here, however 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.360
 not because he walks on the other side 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.560
 about female forces to continue 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.540
 Heidenheim lies down 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.700
 again and again before shoots and eagle there 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.920
 this time partly safe parade 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.709
 but this time I can clear it up well 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.780
 the flank purely because I'm so with that 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.390
 volley shot goes directly to paul 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.620
 Therefore, no chalk on the 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.450
 other side janssen brings the flank 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:32.370
 pure beister star and pushes the thing 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.500
 in the lower right pure connection hits for 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.459
 the hsv or 73 minute but it's about 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.680
 on the other side 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.180
 onion storm sees that china too far 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.670
 out of the chain and then he does 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.260
 the thing purely the hsv with the half b 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.709
 eleven with shell and westermann behind 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.430
 instead of 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.769
 one pulls and westermann pretty cold 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.420
 Surprised and wants to storm the simple 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.310
 easy passes and the shot is 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.799
 actually not durable if he is there 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.780
 he is already very sad after 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.580
 this shot because no good shot found 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.819
 is indeed one tries in longshot but since 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.830
 you do not have to be and that's how it ends 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.019
 play also after these change 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.700
 the two ballets and son could 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.230
 do nothing more 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.940
 you want it with his clean 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.099
 dreier-pack beister with the 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.569
 short-term hit but jahn 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.519
 Regensburg is a round on and on 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:21.739
 must now compete against mainz 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:25.200
 they won 31 mr mainz 3 1 and 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.260
 then, of course, with his 9.7 note 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.480
 fully deserved with his three goals 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:33.299
 incredibly strong game and so it works 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.980
 So in the next round went mainz and 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.359
 the next opponents are then 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.549
 probably very nice, too 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:40.350
 either Dortmund or Bremen 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.750
 as soon as we really get ahead 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.420
 mainz but now yes it is now first 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.620
 the league everyday life against ingolstadt must 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.790
 you can do it first 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.750
 in the league are still ranked 44th 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.359
 points debris at first 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:58.019
 Kaiserslautern that could possibly 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.549
 Decreased today but you have to 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.480
 first win against ingolstadt 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.150
 which of course is a small one 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.530
 The challenge will be because of the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.250
 ingolstädter not too bad 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.079
 stand 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.609
 Although she is currently in the 13th position 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.290
 bad of them have their last 

00:04:08.609 --> 00:04:12.150
 won games or points from the 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:14.519
 but we wanted to jump 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.010
 Of course, it's easy to start something like that 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:19.290
 a game also look at his 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:22.260
 form can continue to hold three goals 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.670
 Of course these are already three 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.390
 ordinary things have been 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.560
 Although all tenable in my opinion but 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.850
 the you have to create only once so 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.310
 it went ingolstadt 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.250
 the table thirteenth went fourth 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.110
 purely tabular so a bit clear 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.300
 But things are jumping for my players 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.090
 ingolstadt is the first good scene 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.580
 over brighter then the high pass comes on 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.890
 meat takes well to dwell Czipin 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.900
 in and then it's already in there soon 

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:50.270
 a 13 very very cold caught jahn 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:53.940
 Regensburg ex works here 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.730
 Take good care of hella 's chip over 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.770
 The Regensburg defender easy to 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.210
 well done and that's how it comes 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.280
 you have to call them perfect 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.040
 insert perfectly into the short gate and 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.080
 then it is still in there but right in 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.480
 Against reins mute the trial times 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:10.260
 because of course get backwind and 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.960
 self-confidence 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.160
 He has been in the game in Hamburg but 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.870
 this shot is not the next in there 

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:18.480
 chance 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:20.100
 wiesmeier with müller on the edge of the page 

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.330
 The ball comes after the audience takes 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.960
 the ball high tries it with one 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.610
 volley but unfortunately it goes a bit 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:28.560
 of course, it would be nice to go over it 

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:31.350
 become gatekeeper but okay müller is again 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.120
 da wiesmayer müller has become 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.540
 meanwhile oriented inwards there 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:37.800
 is back and makes the thing purely 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.620
 third goal of the season for jim patrick müller 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.290
 and thus again the compensation for 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.450
 jahn regensburg wonderfully accepted and 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:47.670
 then left and pushed in but still 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.780
 sometimes comes to the other side suffers 

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.420
 back to the ball and hofmann it 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.830
 this time there and perfectly clears the flank 

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:55.010
 does not bring anything anymore 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:57.180
 and then there's the next chance 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:00.210
 ball loss here from hein then it goes 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.890
 quickly over korkmaz and martin again 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:03.630
 out on unfortunately goes to the penalty room 

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:05.700
 that I do not look good defense again 

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:06.210
 could clarify briefly but still on 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:07.350
 ball 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:09.930
 the flu will then take and then 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.670
 laurito comes from behind and sets them 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.010
 a little bit, of course, actually one 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.550
 and you can still go anyway 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.070
 give 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.980
 paulina actually so own 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.140
 Hofmann is the third eleven for 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:25.350
 ingolstadt this season own takes 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:27.150
 and calls one clarifies and sees wonderful 

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:29.009
 wonderful parade with it still one 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:31.979
 thus also the half-time 

00:06:29.009 --> 00:06:33.860
 May break with the 121 and 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:35.759
 no eleven-meter goal from eigler 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.339
 So let's see what happens in the 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:40.529
 second half so happens first scene 

00:06:38.339 --> 00:06:42.289
 not for ingolstadt though you are in 

00:06:40.529 --> 00:06:45.240
 Ballbesitz are account transferred meyer 

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:47.399
 cheers storm is there double with haag 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:50.580
 to be determined now on the outside 

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:53.149
 the entry comes now but comes 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:57.990
 sloppy but like it with the ball still 

00:06:53.149 --> 00:06:59.939
 Fits inside to lengthen and unhinge 

00:06:57.990 --> 00:07:02.149
 then comes a volley shot but also 

00:06:59.939 --> 00:07:04.439
 this role does not want to go in but 

00:07:02.149 --> 00:07:06.240
 Regensburg puts pressure back 

00:07:04.439 --> 00:07:07.740
 storm again in the penalty area again the 

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.469
 shot but unfortunately this ball is also 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:13.020
 passed by a bit hapless 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:14.759
 contrast to the dfb cup game but 

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:16.979
 so again had to determine here 

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:18.120
 Already his chances the goal came unfortunately 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:20.399
 there was no longer any endurance 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.599
 a corner and there is laurito and yes the 

00:07:20.399 --> 00:07:23.099
 is hurting again 

00:07:21.599 --> 00:07:25.229
 It already got me playing three games ago 

00:07:23.099 --> 00:07:27.539
 it's about time 

00:07:25.229 --> 00:07:28.770
 fought the one to the startelf
