village<00:00:03.000> and<00:00:03.240> today<00:00:03.360> we're<00:00:03.899> going<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.049> learn

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
village and today we're going to learn

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.190 
village and today we're going to learn
the<00:00:04.410> basics<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:05.100> drawing<00:00:05.629> okay<00:00:06.629> now<00:00:07.020> that

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
the basics of drawing okay now that

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.680 
the basics of drawing okay now that
we've<00:00:07.350> used<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.859> gesture<00:00:08.670> drawing<00:00:08.940> work<00:00:09.389> and

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
we've used the gesture drawing work and

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.200 
we've used the gesture drawing work and
we<00:00:10.139> laid<00:00:10.440> out<00:00:10.590> our<00:00:10.620> initial<00:00:11.099> concept<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.820> didn't

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
we laid out our initial concept I didn't

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.330 
we laid out our initial concept I didn't
ticularly<00:00:12.630> like<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.110> layout<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.860> turned

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
ticularly like that layout so I turned

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.970 
ticularly like that layout so I turned
my<00:00:14.580> paper<00:00:14.880> because<00:00:15.780> Jeffrey<00:00:16.350> has<00:00:16.500> such<00:00:16.740> a<00:00:16.770> long

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
my paper because Jeffrey has such a long

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.590 
my paper because Jeffrey has such a long
neck<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.550> want<00:00:17.730> to<00:00:17.789> compensate<00:00:18.270> for<00:00:18.420> that<00:00:18.480> and

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
neck I want to compensate for that and

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.650 
neck I want to compensate for that and
be<00:00:18.900> able<00:00:18.960> to<00:00:19.080> get<00:00:19.199> Jeffrey<00:00:19.970> his<00:00:20.970> entire<00:00:21.390> head

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
be able to get Jeffrey his entire head

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.019 
be able to get Jeffrey his entire head
in<00:00:21.960> this<00:00:22.170> still<00:00:22.800> life<00:00:22.980> so<00:00:23.340> I'm<00:00:23.670> gonna<00:00:23.760> come

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
in this still life so I'm gonna come

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:30.980 
in this still life so I'm gonna come
back<00:00:25.039> pull<00:00:26.039> in<00:00:26.160> my<00:00:26.310> book<00:00:26.550> here<00:00:28.550> okay<00:00:29.840> I'm<00:00:30.840> just

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
back pull in my book here okay I'm just

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.749 
back pull in my book here okay I'm just
gonna<00:00:31.140> loose<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.740> laid<00:00:31.890> out<00:00:31.920> again<00:00:32.399> I'm<00:00:32.520> still

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
gonna loose it laid out again I'm still

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.910 
gonna loose it laid out again I'm still
doing<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.120> gesture<00:00:33.360> drawing<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.020> then<00:00:34.590> once<00:00:34.800> I

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
doing a gesture drawing and then once I

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.100 
doing a gesture drawing and then once I
get<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.160> composition<00:00:35.520> I<00:00:35.850> like<00:00:36.090> then<00:00:36.540> we<00:00:36.930> can

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
get the composition I like then we can

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.440 
get the composition I like then we can
go<00:00:37.230> to<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.500> shading<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.760> really<00:00:39.120> get<00:00:39.329> in

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
go to the shading and really get in

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.340 
go to the shading and really get in
depth<00:00:39.719> with<00:00:39.930> this<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.379> make<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.800> nice<00:00:41.100> piece

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
depth with this to make it a nice piece

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.720 
depth with this to make it a nice piece
we<00:00:43.350> kind<00:00:43.559> of<00:00:43.620> have<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.829> get<00:00:43.950> our<00:00:44.070> composition

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
we kind of have to get our composition

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.830 
we kind of have to get our composition
right<00:00:44.910> or<00:00:45.750> how<00:00:45.930> we<00:00:45.989> are<00:00:47.149> we<00:00:48.149> would<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.510> see

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
right or how we are we would like to see

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.290 
right or how we are we would like to see
it<00:00:48.960> first<00:00:49.469> before<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:49.920> start<00:00:50.039> shading<00:00:50.489> there's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
it first before we start shading there's

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.660 
it first before we start shading there's
no<00:00:51.480> reason<00:00:52.440> to<00:00:52.469> shade<00:00:52.770> anything<00:00:53.280> if<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.550> don't

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
no reason to shade anything if you don't

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.650 
no reason to shade anything if you don't
like<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> proportion<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.809> the<00:00:55.320> composition

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
like the proportion and the composition

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:08.390 
like the proportion and the composition
okay<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:58.199> coming<00:00:58.890> here<00:00:59.219> with<00:00:59.399> my<00:00:59.430> sculpture

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.000 

Wow<00:01:09.390> I'm<00:01:09.960> actually<00:01:10.230> gonna<00:01:10.500> start<00:01:10.620> at

see<00:01:24.810> how<00:01:24.930> about<00:01:25.080> jawline<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.770> there<00:01:26.010> a<00:01:26.040> human

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
see how about jawline is there a human

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.490 
see how about jawline is there a human
jaw<00:01:26.670> from<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.270> side<00:01:27.480> is<00:01:27.690> pretty<00:01:28.080> much<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
jaw from the side is pretty much the

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.960 
jaw from the side is pretty much the
same<00:01:28.710> way<00:01:28.950> I<00:01:29.220> believe<00:01:29.370> that's<00:01:29.640> called<00:01:29.790> the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
same way I believe that's called the

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.270 
same way I believe that's called the
mandible<00:01:30.420> okay<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.380> come<00:01:31.800> on<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.070> just

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
mandible okay so come on here just

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.630 
mandible okay so come on here just
indicate<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.990> really<00:01:34.710> long<00:01:35.240> neck

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.550 

comes<00:01:41.640> out<00:01:41.850> here<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.170> see<00:01:43.410> how<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
comes out here and then you see how the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.770 
comes out here and then you see how the
chest<00:01:43.650> actually<00:01:44.340> drops<00:01:44.640> down<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:45.330> where<00:01:45.510> it<00:01:45.630> -

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
chest actually drops down to where it -

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.450 
chest actually drops down to where it -
nothing<00:01:46.230> where<00:01:46.410> you<00:01:46.530> can't<00:01:46.770> see<00:01:47.070> it<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:48.290> this

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
nothing where you can't see it like this

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.190 
nothing where you can't see it like this
and<00:01:50.460> from<00:01:50.700> my<00:01:50.880> angle<00:01:51.210> his<00:01:51.510> hip<00:01:51.750> actually

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
and from my angle his hip actually

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.750 
and from my angle his hip actually
starts<00:01:52.530> way<00:01:52.770> up<00:01:52.800> here<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.540> did<00:01:54.540> this<00:01:55.580> get<00:01:56.580> the
