00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
thing I want to talk about is that when

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.270 
thing I want to talk about is that when
you<00:00:41.399> hold<00:00:41.610> l<00:00:41.850> shift<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.629> you<00:00:43.020> click<00:00:43.230> whole<00:00:43.590> it

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
you hold l shift and you click whole it

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.740 
you hold l shift and you click whole it
will<00:00:44.399> automatically<00:00:44.820> go<00:00:45.000> inside<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.329> furnace

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
will automatically go inside of furnace

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.500 
will automatically go inside of furnace
and<00:00:45.930> same<00:00:46.710> with<00:00:46.739> quick<00:00:47.730> stuff<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.300> for<00:00:48.450> example

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
and same with quick stuff so for example

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.240 
and same with quick stuff so for example
if<00:00:48.780> i<00:00:48.840> place<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.320> they're<00:00:49.530> automatically<00:00:50.100> go

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
if i place that they're automatically go

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.090 
if i place that they're automatically go
outside<00:00:50.520> if<00:00:51.210> i<00:00:51.449> go<00:00:51.960> back<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.289> forth<00:00:52.440> such<00:00:52.980> as

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
outside if i go back and forth such as

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.420 
outside if i go back and forth such as
such<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.850> we<00:00:53.940> just<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.600> that<00:00:54.960> L<00:00:55.680> shift<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
such and we just have that L shift and

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.470 
such and we just have that L shift and
it<00:00:56.910> works<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.660> basically<00:00:58.020> um<00:00:59.390> instead<00:01:00.390> of

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
it works so basically um instead of

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.389 
it works so basically um instead of
dragging<00:01:00.960> it<00:01:01.230> in<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.710> could<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:01.949> tell<00:01:02.190> ship

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
dragging it in you could just tell ship

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.969 
dragging it in you could just tell ship
and<00:01:02.609> it<00:01:02.670> should<00:01:02.969> work<00:01:03.180> inside<00:01:03.600> now<00:01:04.170> hopefully

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
and it should work inside now hopefully

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.460 
and it should work inside now hopefully
they'll<00:01:05.129> implement<00:01:05.750> armor<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.900> do<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.170> exact

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
they'll implement armor to do the exact

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.800 
they'll implement armor to do the exact
same<00:01:07.500> thing<00:01:07.860> have<00:01:08.520> our<00:01:08.790> major<00:01:09.030> inventory<00:01:09.600> and

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
think actually i didn't that's pretty

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:41.420 
think actually i didn't that's pretty
much<00:04:34.050> it<00:04:35.210> the<00:04:36.210> dinner<00:04:36.510> to<00:04:36.660> do<00:04:37.850> um<00:04:40.280> no<00:04:41.280> I<00:04:41.310> think

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
much it the dinner to do um no I think

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.280 
much it the dinner to do um no I think
that's<00:04:41.669> it<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:42.090> can't<00:04:42.660> think<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:42.870> anything<00:04:43.110> else

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
that's it I can't think of anything else

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.590 
that's it I can't think of anything else
I<00:04:43.470> was<00:04:43.590> in<00:04:43.770> this<00:04:43.889> update<00:04:44.120> it<00:04:45.120> wasn't<00:04:45.419> really

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
I was in this update it wasn't really

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:47.810 
I was in this update it wasn't really
that<00:04:45.720> long<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:46.410> wasn't<00:04:46.979> really<00:04:47.130> that<00:04:47.610> many

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
that long it wasn't really that many

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.850 
that long it wasn't really that many
things<00:04:48.090> into<00:04:48.450> it<00:04:48.570> so<00:04:49.139> that's<00:04:49.290> reason<00:04:49.560> why<00:04:49.650> it's

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
things into it so that's reason why it's

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:52.280 
things into it so that's reason why it's
a<00:04:49.919> snapshot<00:04:50.220> right<00:04:50.760> now<00:04:50.880> until<00:04:51.110> they<00:04:52.110> adds

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
a snapshot right now until they adds

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.320 
a snapshot right now until they adds
forth<00:04:52.650> more<00:04:53.280> things<00:04:53.520> into<00:04:53.850> the<00:04:53.970> full<00:04:54.150> version

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
forth more things into the full version

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.870 
forth more things into the full version
so<00:04:55.200> yeah<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.800> think<00:04:55.889> that's<00:04:56.190> pretty<00:04:56.340> much<00:04:56.460> it<00:04:56.520> so

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
so yeah I think that's pretty much it so

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.340 
so yeah I think that's pretty much it so
