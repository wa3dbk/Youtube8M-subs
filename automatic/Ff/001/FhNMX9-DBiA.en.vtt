00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.279
 Hi, I am Lucy Ellis, HP's global ProLiant on Windows marketing manager. 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:15.900
 Today's coffee lecture, I want to bring you to know 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.460
 New version of the Microsoft Windows Server 2012 family and 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.529
 Authorization mode 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.199
 First, let's look at the new version provided. 

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.560
 Windows Server 2012 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.359
 With the official release of Windows Server 2012, you now have the following versions to choose from: Foundation, essentials, standard and datacenter 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.120
 The original Windows Server 2008 R2 Foundation version has been replaced by the new Foundation version 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.610
 Windows Server 2012 Foundation version 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.600
 Foundation is an "entry-level, cost-effective" version for small businesses 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.200
 Enables small businesses to easily access secure networks, file/print sharing 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.280
 Or as a platform for databases and business applications, at an affordable price 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.520
 This version is limited to 15 users. No additional Client Access Authorization (CALS) required 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.980
 Windows Server 2012 Essentials version is used to replace Microsoft Small 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.770
 Business Server 2011 Essentials version 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.400
 The Essentials version is the best server software for small businesses for the first time. 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.740
 It has the same function as Foundation 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.850
 Can be accessed by up to 25 users 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.380
 It also includes simplified management tools 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:21.330
 And can be smoothly connected to the cloud service 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.090
 Like Foundation, Essentials does not require additional CALs. 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.780
 Replaced with the Windows Server 2012 Standard edition 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:32.040
 Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard Edition 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.180
 But wait a minute, you will find that the function and authorization modes have changed. 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.159
 It is compared to the 2008 R2 version 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.170
 There is no replacement product in the Windows Server 2008 R2 Enterprise Enterprise Edition 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.750
 In the Windows Server 2012 product line 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.800
 The highest-end product in the Windows Server 2012 family is 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.040
 Datacenter version 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.640
 Used to replace Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter. 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.140
 Unlike the Standard and Datacenter editions of Windows Server 2008 R2, 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.150
 Standard and Datacenter for Windows Server 2012 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.049
 The features of the version are identical. 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:07.890
 Both are 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.409
 The authorization mode is also the same: based on the number of processors, plus CALs 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:15.819
 Differences between Windows Server 2012 Standard and Datacenter 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.649
 In the virtualization function 

00:02:17.649 --> 00:02:24.329
 For example: Standard version is 2 CPU products, each license can support 2 VMs 

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.979
 Datacenter version is a 2 CPU product that supports an unlimited number of VMs 

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:33.719
 As for "virtualization," let's look at virtualization permissions one by one. 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.209
 Each version of the Windows Server 2012 product line 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:44.629
 Foundation "cannot be virtualized": cannot be virtualized as a guest OS, nor can it be 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:48.069
 As a virtualization host OS 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.180
 Essentials can be "limited virtualization": it can be virtualized as a guest OS. 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.239
 But not as a virtualized host OS 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.249
 Standard has "virtual use rights": each dual processor license contains 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:06.349
 Up to two VMs perform individual authorizations, 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:10.250
 You can "push up" more than one Standard license on a server to get extra 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.469
 VM permissions 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:15.930
 Datacenter 2012 has "unlimited virtualization" permissions 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.109
 Same as the current version of Windows Server 2008 R2 Datacenter 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.120
 Next, let's look at the hardware limitations for each version of Windows Server 2012. 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.829
 And authorization mode changes: 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.249
 Windows Server 2012 Foundation version is limited to one 

00:03:30.249 --> 00:03:31.629
 processor 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.509
 The authorization mode of the Foundation version has not changed, it is a 

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:38.759
 Depending on the number of servers 

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:43.079
 The Essentials version supports up to two processors at most; the Essentials version 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:48.759
 The authorization mode has not changed and is also priced based on the number of servers. 

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:53.159
 As I mentioned earlier, Windows Server 2012 Standard now bases the basic authorization on the number of processors. 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.749
 The same processor as Datacenter 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:01.949
 Supports up to 2 units, you can "stack" more licenses 

00:04:01.949 --> 00:04:06.019
 To execute the Standard version on a server with more than 2 processors 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.889
 The Datacenter licensing model for Windows Server 2012 is still based on the number of processors. 

00:04:09.889 --> 00:04:11.510
 Supports up to 2 processors 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.939
 Per authorization 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:17.319
 I have said twice that you can "stack" more than one Standard license. 

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:18.769
 On a server 

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:23.190
 To do this, there is now a new standard for version licensing called 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.940
 "Additional Authorization" 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.740
 Allows you to easily increase when the server requires additional authorization 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:35.720
 More CPUs or more virtual execution entities. Any HP OEM license 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.440
 HP OEM "Additional License" for Windows Server 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.440
 Windows Server 2012 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:47.050
 Can only be sold to end users of new HP ProLiant servers. This means that you must know 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.310
 Customer demand 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.660
 For CPUs and virtual execution entities 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.340
 For example, if you know that a customer is going to buy a 4 CPU solution, or if you 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.030
 Knowing that customers need 4 VMs, you must sell the basic license at the same time. 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.990
 And additional authorization. HP OEM product naming will be labeled "additive" 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:08.870
 Or "add" in the product name 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.700
 Help you identify pre-installation and 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.809
 NPI version 

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:18.610
 If it is ROK sales 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.849
 Will double the basic authorization content to meet your additional licensing requirements 

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.619
 When this is enough, if you need to expand capacity and virtualization capabilities 

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.240
 Customers buy new ProLiant 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.520
 And purchase HP OEM licenses 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.020
 You can also purchase additional licenses from Microsoft 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.199
 Another change in the OEM license for Windows Server 2012 Standard Edition is 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:40.249
 CAL's 

00:05:40.249 --> 00:05:43.649
 No longer included in the kit content 

00:05:43.649 --> 00:05:47.469
 In Windows Server 2008 R2, the Standard version comes with 

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.060
 5 CALs 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.790
 There are no CALs in the Windows Server 2012 Standard edition, so 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:58.839
 You must purchase HP OEM units or user CALs separately 

00:05:58.839 --> 00:06:03.059
 The Datacenter version is the most suitable version for virtualization 

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:06.430
 Provides "unlimited number" of virtual storage individuals 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.389
 Similar to the Standard version, each additional license 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:12.879
 Need 2 extra CPUs 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:16.430
 CALS is also sold separately 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:21.770
 The final point about licensing is that each version has a "single product key" 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.169
 Used to start the product 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:27.389
 Microsoft now offers a consistent "downgrade product" option 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:31.289
 Available for "mass" and OEM products 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:34.210
 HP offers a wealth of options and changes 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:41.169
 Covered on the ProLiant platform, available from MicroServer, Tower (ML), Rack (DL), Blade (BL) 

00:06:41.169 --> 00:06:42.060
 Scale out (SL) 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:45.960
 And have been certified for Windows Server 2012 product line 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.460
 For certification information on HP ProLiant Generation 7 and 8 platforms 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.159

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:53.509
