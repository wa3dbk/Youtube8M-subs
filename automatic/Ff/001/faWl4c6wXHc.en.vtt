get a breakout game last year against I

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.369 
get a breakout game last year against I
think<00:00:45.530> he<00:00:45.590> had<00:00:45.680> 28<00:00:46.010> points<00:00:46.309> and<00:00:47.320> you<00:00:48.320> know

00:00:48.369 --> 00:00:48.379 
think he had 28 points and you know

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:49.780 
think he had 28 points and you know
we've<00:00:48.559> been<00:00:48.590> scouting<00:00:48.950> for<00:00:49.340> quite<00:00:49.520> some<00:00:49.760> time

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
we've been scouting for quite some time

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.000 
we've been scouting for quite some time
knowing<00:00:50.390> that<00:00:50.570> we<00:00:51.050> could<00:00:51.199> both<00:00:51.350> possibly<00:00:51.860> be

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
knowing that we could both possibly be

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.070 
knowing that we could both possibly be
in<00:00:52.100> this<00:00:52.220> position<00:00:52.400> so<00:00:52.940> I<00:00:53.180> think<00:00:53.570> doesn't<00:00:53.839> let

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
in this position so I think doesn't let

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.079 
in this position so I think doesn't let
him<00:00:54.199> look<00:00:54.290> more<00:00:54.470> familiarity<00:00:54.980> and<00:00:55.309> we<00:00:55.970> know

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
him look more familiarity and we know

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:57.280 
him look more familiarity and we know

what kind of players have you know we

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.549 
what kind of players have you know we
can't<00:00:57.830> just<00:00:58.010> stop<00:00:58.390> Frank<00:00:59.390> we<00:00:59.570> have<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.870> stop

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
can't just stop Frank we have the stop

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:01.930 
can't just stop Frank we have the stop
Sam<00:01:00.830> Dekker<00:01:01.129> who's<00:01:01.400> been<00:01:01.580> playing<00:01:01.699> really
