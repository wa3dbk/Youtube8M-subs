 welcome to antler I am alex and 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.960
 I'm going to talk about a group that 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:10.940
 it's called why they make Arabic music and 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.219
 electronics with something alternative 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.350
 they just released their debut album that 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.690
 called boom in are 10 songs that we 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.340
 they talk about typical love stories but 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.410
 that relax you and the instrumentation is 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.420
 very soft and he puts himself in a good mood 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.730
 we knew nothing this group did not know if 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.849
 they were two very sensual women women 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.160
 but finally they came to light and already 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.590
 we know what they are are two men who 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.290
 have been working previously with 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.960
 other artists but they have already come together and 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.270
 they do a good chemistry I hope that they 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.190
 like this recommendation here below 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.560
 I'm going to leave the link so they can listen to the 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.600
 disc I recommend them mainly 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.650
 a song called hop in my 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.340
 work 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.350
 then I hope you like it 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.390
 I'm going to tell you a little about the new 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.510
 samsung galaxy s 4 is a cell phone 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.760
 quite innovative huge makes you be 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.500
 looser this cell phone has enough 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.269
 characteristics imagine that I have it 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.310
 here just slid is the hand over 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.710
 of the cell phone or 20 without making contact 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.510
 passes from one application to another part 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.560
 of leisure for example your system 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.869
 operative is a 4.2.2 yale and ping to 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.450
 many will like your ram memory is 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:23.050
 of 2gb obviously has memory 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.940
 cda and the battery lasts a lot and is the 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.399
 cell phone so said he turns on the 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.320
 screen then when you turn around 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.360
 anything goes off then this 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.050
 base that saves energy already lasts longer and 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.480
 more people 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.520
 something that you will surely have to do 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:38.260
 is to sell a kidney because it is very expensive 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.480
 this cell phone but if you have the 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:42.860
 opportunity buy it worth it and 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.960
 surely you will like 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:47.030
 hello guys and girls we are going to talk to you 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:49.780
 of colors that are more trendy and not 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.780
 you can put 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.710
 well one of them could be the orange 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.870
 it has already been either very strong or very 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.880
 clearly that they will see well that's crazy 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.580
 It also has very strong what are the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.520
 yellow rings either in lemon color 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.290
 either in very dark color it will look very 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.060
 I turned it on if they put it with a 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.640
 conjunct with strong what comes 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.490
 they would be what the blues are because 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.650
 all sailors have super super os 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.440
 part if you want to combine it with something 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.300
 white would look good another color les 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.430
 You can recommend then you can also 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.980
 make the purple ones with the very colors 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.110
 acid which is where you almost face 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.270
 vintage is a pump that comes more or 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.550
 less like the eighties good if they go 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.350
