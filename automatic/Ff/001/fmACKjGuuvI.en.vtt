00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:37.900 
in the past because it put a little less

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
things that will happen with the angle

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.370 
things that will happen with the angle

so that gave our defense or put some

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.320 
so that gave our defense or put some
real<00:01:59.290> stress<00:01:59.650> on<00:01:59.890> our<00:02:00.040> drop<00:02:00.369> in<00:02:00.610> there<00:02:01.030> again

that we'll look at here is our Eagle
cover<00:02:14.379> -<00:02:14.790> we're<00:02:15.790> gonna<00:02:15.879> align<00:02:16.180> people<00:02:16.420> and

cover - we're gonna align people and
three<00:02:16.900> techniques<00:02:17.379> on<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.620> inside<00:02:18.129> eighths

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
three techniques on the inside eighths

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.910 
three techniques on the inside eighths
on<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:18.970> edges<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.599> then<00:02:20.260> our<00:02:20.440> inside

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
on the edges and then our inside

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.770 
on the edges and then our inside
linebackers<00:02:21.819> because<00:02:22.270> we<00:02:22.420> have<00:02:22.510> the<00:02:22.630> two

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
linebackers because we have the two

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.270 
linebackers because we have the two
three<00:02:23.140> techniques<00:02:23.620> in<00:02:23.770> front<00:02:23.980> of<00:02:24.040> us<00:02:24.130> we

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
three techniques in front of us we

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.950 
three techniques in front of us we
actually<00:02:24.459> bounce<00:02:24.940> out<00:02:25.240> over<00:02:25.660> the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
actually bounce out over the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.750 
actually bounce out over the
Hackl<00:02:26.350> because<00:02:26.620> we<00:02:26.770> don't<00:02:26.950> feel<00:02:27.130> we<00:02:27.160> need<00:02:27.400> five

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
Hackl because we don't feel we need five

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.630 
Hackl because we don't feel we need five
on<00:02:28.120> three<00:02:28.510> five<00:02:28.900> over<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.410> center<00:02:30.250> and<00:02:30.460> two

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:30.640 
on three five over the center and two

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.550 
on three five over the center and two
guards<00:02:30.880> there<00:02:31.330> so<00:02:31.540> we<00:02:31.630> bounced<00:02:31.870> them<00:02:32.200> on<00:02:32.350> over

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
guards there so we bounced them on over

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.280 
guards there so we bounced them on over
and<00:02:32.980> then<00:02:33.490> their<00:02:33.670> gap<00:02:33.880> responses<00:02:34.600> become<00:02:34.930> very

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
and then their gap responses become very

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.790 
and then their gap responses become very
very<00:02:35.590> easy<00:02:35.980> as<00:02:36.460> you<00:02:36.730> will<00:02:36.850> see<00:02:37.060> develop<00:02:37.540> here

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
very easy as you will see develop here

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.470 
very easy as you will see develop here
if<00:02:38.800> this<00:02:39.040> was<00:02:39.250> double<00:02:39.700> tight<00:02:39.940> you<00:02:40.240> would<00:02:40.360> just

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
if this was double tight you would just

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.330 
if this was double tight you would just
simply<00:02:40.810> have<00:02:40.960> that<00:02:41.110> second<00:02:41.560> defensive<00:02:42.100> end

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
simply have that second defensive end

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.700 
simply have that second defensive end
lined<00:02:43.120> up<00:02:43.390> in<00:02:43.600> the<00:02:43.810> eighth<00:02:43.960> technique<00:02:44.500> over

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
lined up in the eighth technique over

the second tight end the snap these

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.180 
the second tight end the snap these

players will come out low and hard we

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:21.629 
type situation here we think this is a
great<00:05:18.750> pass<00:05:19.750> defense<00:05:20.470> as<00:05:20.800> well<00:05:21.310> because

00:05:21.629 --> 00:05:21.639 
great pass defense as well because

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:24.300 
great pass defense as well because
you've<00:05:21.789> got<00:05:21.909> people<00:05:21.940> in<00:05:22.360> a<00:05:22.479> shade<00:05:22.840> 5a<00:05:23.620> rushing

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
you've got people in a shade 5a rushing

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:26.040 
you've got people in a shade 5a rushing
up<00:05:24.460> front<00:05:24.759> we're<00:05:25.000> a<00:05:25.030> little<00:05:25.240> bit<00:05:25.509> thin<00:05:25.750> in<00:05:25.930> our

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
up front we're a little bit thin in our

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.080 
up front we're a little bit thin in our
drops<00:05:26.470> but<00:05:26.800> we<00:05:26.889> are<00:05:27.039> bringing<00:05:27.310> five<00:05:27.729> so<00:05:27.970> the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
drops but we are bringing five so the

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:29.219 
drops but we are bringing five so the
pressure<00:05:28.330> is<00:05:28.449> gonna<00:05:28.569> have<00:05:28.720> to<00:05:28.750> be<00:05:28.900> fairly

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
pressure is gonna have to be fairly

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:32.839 
pressure is gonna have to be fairly

his drop out to the flat our inside

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:39.779 
his drop out to the flat our inside
linebacker<00:05:38.530> sucked<00:05:38.949> up<00:05:39.159> a<00:05:39.250> bit<00:05:39.430> more<00:05:39.639> than

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
linebacker sucked up a bit more than

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:42.450 
linebacker sucked up a bit more than
what<00:05:39.880> we<00:05:40.000> want<00:05:40.240> on<00:05:40.479> the<00:05:40.509> play-action<00:05:41.340> but<00:05:42.340> our

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:42.460 
what we want on the play-action but our

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:43.980 
what we want on the play-action but our
corners<00:05:42.819> and<00:05:42.940> safeties<00:05:43.180> will<00:05:43.599> key<00:05:43.810> their

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
corners and safeties will key their

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.659 
corners and safeties will key their
tight<00:05:44.259> ends<00:05:44.500> and<00:05:44.620> wings<00:05:44.889> to<00:05:45.039> their<00:05:45.190> side<00:05:45.460> and

tight ends and wings to their side and

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.879 
tight ends and wings to their side and
get<00:05:45.789> their<00:05:45.969> drops<00:05:46.270> now<00:05:47.169> as<00:05:47.349> we<00:05:47.590> said<00:05:47.860> before

00:05:47.879 --> 00:05:47.889 
get their drops now as we said before

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:49.770 
get their drops now as we said before
one<00:05:48.490> of<00:05:48.520> the<00:05:48.669> problems<00:05:49.090> that<00:05:49.180> we<00:05:49.270> have<00:05:49.479> is<00:05:49.659> we

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:49.780 
one of the problems that we have is we

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.810 
one of the problems that we have is we
do<00:05:49.900> have<00:05:49.990> a<00:05:50.050> bit<00:05:50.259> of<00:05:50.289> a<00:05:50.469> bubble<00:05:50.860> in<00:05:51.070> that<00:05:51.250> C<00:05:51.550> gap

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
do have a bit of a bubble in that C gap

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:53.879 
do have a bit of a bubble in that C gap
so<00:05:52.180> what<00:05:52.389> we<00:05:52.509> came<00:05:52.719> up<00:05:52.780> with<00:05:53.139> was<00:05:53.380> what<00:05:53.620> we<00:05:53.710> call

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:53.889 
so what we came up with was what we call

00:05:53.889 --> 00:05:55.620 
so what we came up with was what we call
our<00:05:54.009> Eagle<00:05:54.370> crash<00:05:54.699> look<00:05:55.120> and<00:05:55.330> this<00:05:55.389> will

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:55.630 
our Eagle crash look and this will

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:58.439 
our Eagle crash look and this will
involve<00:05:55.810> our<00:05:56.080> defensive<00:05:56.710> ends<00:05:57.099> our<00:05:57.759> defensive

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
involve our defensive ends our defensive

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.330 
involve our defensive ends our defensive
ends<00:05:58.570> will<00:05:58.750> come<00:05:58.930> down<00:05:59.139> into<00:05:59.349> the<00:05:59.530> C<00:05:59.770> gap<00:06:00.039> or

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
ends will come down into the C gap or

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:02.040 
ends will come down into the C gap or
crash<00:06:00.729> that's<00:06:01.150> how<00:06:01.300> we<00:06:01.360> put<00:06:01.659> that<00:06:01.840> together

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:02.050 
crash that's how we put that together

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.010 
crash that's how we put that together
and<00:06:02.469> then<00:06:03.250> our<00:06:03.460> inside<00:06:04.030> linebackers<00:06:04.719> will<00:06:04.900> now

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:05.020 
and then our inside linebackers will now

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:06.870 
and then our inside linebackers will now
have<00:06:05.259> an<00:06:05.380> outside<00:06:05.919> containment<00:06:06.490> we're<00:06:06.789> gonna

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 
have an outside containment we're gonna

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.059 
have an outside containment we're gonna
contain<00:06:07.449> things<00:06:07.750> from<00:06:08.110> an<00:06:08.229> inside-out

00:06:09.059 --> 00:06:09.069 
contain things from an inside-out

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:11.070 
contain things from an inside-out
position<00:06:09.849> here<00:06:10.030> we<00:06:10.180> do<00:06:10.330> things<00:06:10.599> a<00:06:10.750> little<00:06:10.930> bit

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
position here we do things a little bit

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.020 
position here we do things a little bit
differently<00:06:11.620> with<00:06:11.710> this<00:06:12.039> particular<00:06:12.370> defense

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:13.030 
differently with this particular defense

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:14.939 
differently with this particular defense
we're<00:06:13.659> gonna<00:06:13.750> create<00:06:14.110> a<00:06:14.169> tremendous<00:06:14.710> amount

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:14.949 
we're gonna create a tremendous amount

00:06:14.949 --> 00:06:16.709 
we're gonna create a tremendous amount
of<00:06:15.039> pressure<00:06:15.310> with<00:06:15.580> our<00:06:15.610> defensive<00:06:16.300> line<00:06:16.360> from

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:16.719 
of pressure with our defensive line from

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:20.820 
of pressure with our defensive line from
the<00:06:16.870> C<00:06:17.110> gap<00:06:17.349> inward<00:06:18.069> and<00:06:18.569> in<00:06:19.569> return<00:06:20.020> we<00:06:20.710> are

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
the C gap inward and in return we are

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.709 
the C gap inward and in return we are
going<00:06:21.130> to<00:06:21.280> contain<00:06:21.789> with<00:06:22.150> our<00:06:22.300> inside

00:06:22.709 --> 00:06:22.719 
going to contain with our inside

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:24.959 
going to contain with our inside
linebackers<00:06:23.469> and<00:06:23.650> also<00:06:23.949> when<00:06:24.069> you<00:06:24.190> use<00:06:24.490> our

00:06:24.959 --> 00:06:24.969 
linebackers and also when you use our

00:06:24.969 --> 00:06:27.659 
linebackers and also when you use our
secondary<00:06:25.719> for<00:06:25.990> containment<00:06:26.380> as<00:06:26.650> well<00:06:26.889> this

00:06:27.659 --> 00:06:27.669 
secondary for containment as well this

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.520 
secondary for containment as well this
defense<00:06:28.210> creates<00:06:28.599> as<00:06:28.780> I<00:06:28.930> said<00:06:29.199> again<00:06:29.500> a

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
defense creates as I said again a

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:31.589 
defense creates as I said again a
tremendous<00:06:29.740> amount<00:06:30.370> of<00:06:30.430> pressure<00:06:30.759> as<00:06:31.090> these

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:31.599 
tremendous amount of pressure as these

00:06:31.599 --> 00:06:33.809 
tremendous amount of pressure as these
people<00:06:31.960> will<00:06:32.110> squeeze<00:06:32.469> down<00:06:32.710> into<00:06:33.159> the<00:06:33.280> C<00:06:33.550> gap

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:33.819 
people will squeeze down into the C gap

00:06:33.819 --> 00:06:36.930 
people will squeeze down into the C gap
and<00:06:34.120> bring<00:06:34.300> the<00:06:34.419> pressure<00:06:34.710> and<00:06:35.710> we<00:06:36.580> will<00:06:36.759> have

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:36.940 
and bring the pressure and we will have

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.689 
and bring the pressure and we will have
to<00:06:37.090> then<00:06:37.270> contain<00:06:37.870> from<00:06:38.169> the<00:06:38.289> inside<00:06:38.860> out<00:06:39.130> with

00:06:39.689 --> 00:06:39.699 
to then contain from the inside out with

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.029 
to then contain from the inside out with
our<00:06:40.000> linebackers<00:06:40.930> which<00:06:41.110> is<00:06:41.289> not<00:06:41.500> as<00:06:41.710> much<00:06:41.919> of

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 
our linebackers which is not as much of

00:06:42.039 --> 00:06:45.630 
our linebackers which is not as much of
a<00:06:42.099> problem<00:06:42.310> as<00:06:42.550> long<00:06:42.610> as<00:06:42.969> you<00:06:43.090> keep<00:06:43.360> your
