00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:08.740
 hi how about how are you tonight 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.719
 some friends come to dinner at home and 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.490
 I want to prepare something for you very rich 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:14.289
 a zucchini pudding with leaves 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.820
 salvia why I'm here in the 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:17.439
 Florists say that here in this place 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.970
 they hide small but big 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.820
 secrets of nature as per 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.740
 example the luisa grass that is digestive 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.970
 ideal for menstrual pain plus if 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.250
 moss chews in the mouth leaves a 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.230
 authentically refreshing taste or the 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.730
 thyme that in infusion is ideal against 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.500
 the cough and if we add it at the end of each 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.870
 food will enhance the flavor of your sauces 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.280
 and soups one day I will explain how 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.949
 use my grandmother to aromatize 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.960
 vinegars or also for example the 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.050
 oregano that is not only good for 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.249
 pizza e if we put it in an infusion 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.899
 clears the airway by 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.010
 true not all are as innocent as 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:49.960
 It seems 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.420
 here we have another 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.739
 the rue that besides being very toxic 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.469
 it serves to scare off mosquitoes 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.030
 well I think that to mosquitoes and 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:00:59.769
 also to people in the middle ages 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.719
 he called the plant of forgiveness because 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.399
 when drinking the tea served to lose 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:06.040
 the consciousness and in this way forget 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.890
 of the sins good and here finally 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.540
 we have salvia its flavor is intense 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.270
 a bit spicy but combines the 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:14.950
 perfection with rice legumes and sauces 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.840
 of gratin or four cheeses and 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.700
 I'll use it to give it a good touch 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.619
 special to the published so I'm going to 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.850
 prepare and if you want to use the 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.310
 Salads can also give you a 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.020
 different touch also the sage is from 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.420
 same gender as the chia also called 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.860
 salvia hispanic plant with blue flowers 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.020
 and white that was sacred to the 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.910
 Aztecs they ate their seeds 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.979
 mixed with lemon water to obtain 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.020
 and energy for the whole day plus 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.509
 mexico today is still using the 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.860
 Chia gave them high doses of fiber 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:43.630
 helping them regulate transit 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.909
 intestinal and to keep a body in 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.190
 perfect state that without counting that 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.960
 gave magnesium calcium and phosphorus elements 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.220
 indispensable to maintain the body and 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.690
 the healthy mind 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.690
