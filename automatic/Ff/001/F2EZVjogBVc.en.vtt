00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:19.890
 powershot g15 this is the new g15 a 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:23.010
 camera with an aluminum body is 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.110
 much smaller and more manageable than the g12 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.930
 that preceded it 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:33.300
 the sensor the new sensor c mos da 12 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.559

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.410
 system 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.660
 all to allow shooting 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.739
 high quality photos and videos also with 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.739
 few light 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.300

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.920
 equals a 28 140 mm 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.070
 the main feature of this 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:00.640
 lens and that is very bright 1828 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.550
 on the upper part we find two dials la 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.430
 program ring and the dial of 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.820
 intentional over- exposure 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.490
 this is the lens selector e 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.820
 power off button 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.909
 on the opposite side there is 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.500
 the integrated flash 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:24.560
 the g 15 can however 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.820
 mount an external flash on the water on 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.420
 this is up to you 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.690
 on the back we see the optical viewfinder with 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.780
 dioptric correction 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.830
 and the 3-inch high lcd screen 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.580
 resolution around 920,000 points 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.340
 next 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.490
 the usual the usual 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.570
 selector for the various functions and for 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.570
 enter the 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.830

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:12.560
 achieve full hd filming at 24 fps 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.720
 sensitivity arrives 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.700
 or rather the range of sensitivity goes 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.700
 from 80 to 12800 iso 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.790
 10 frames per second sequence
