00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
so basically I'm not driving it right

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.100 
so basically I'm not driving it right
now<00:03:13.110> until<00:03:13.379> I<00:03:13.530> can<00:03:13.799> get<00:03:14.280> out<00:03:14.459> and<00:03:15.110> probably

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
now until I can get out and probably

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.880 
now until I can get out and probably
take<00:03:16.290> the

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:17.890 
take the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.580 
take the
transaxle<00:03:18.880> from<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.150> engine<00:03:19.540> and<00:03:19.570> get<00:03:20.470> in

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 
transaxle from the engine and get in

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.500 
transaxle from the engine and get in
there<00:03:20.770> and<00:03:20.890> make<00:03:21.010> sure<00:03:21.330> everything's<00:03:22.330> okay

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510

definitely<00:03:22.960> replace<00:03:23.440> the<00:03:23.740> throw<00:03:24.070> out<00:03:24.220> bearing

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
definitely replace the throw out bearing

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.990 
definitely replace the throw out bearing
because<00:03:24.790> I<00:03:24.910> know<00:03:24.970> it's<00:03:25.320> kind<00:03:26.320> of<00:03:26.410> messed<00:03:26.590> up
