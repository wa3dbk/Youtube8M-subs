need<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.609> capo<00:00:29.939> on<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.090> first<00:00:30.330> fret<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:31.410> I<00:00:31.529> know

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
need a capo on the first fret and I know

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.209 
need a capo on the first fret and I know
that<00:00:32.540> but<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.660> reality<00:00:33.780> does<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.829> cable

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
that but in reality does the cable

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.630 
that but in reality does the cable
really<00:00:35.910> matter<00:00:36.180> no<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.160> gonna<00:00:38.340> teach<00:00:38.610> it

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
really matter no so I'm gonna teach it

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.340 
really matter no so I'm gonna teach it
without<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.360> capo<00:00:39.660> and<00:00:39.809> here's<00:00:39.989> my<00:00:40.140> thought

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
without the capo and here's my thought

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.160 
without the capo and here's my thought
process<00:00:40.710> behind<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.120> reason<00:00:42.120> number<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.510> if

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
process behind that reason number one if

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.119 
process behind that reason number one if
you<00:00:43.829> have<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:44.129> capo<00:00:45.350> you<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:46.559> simply<00:00:46.920> take<00:00:47.070> it

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
you have a capo you can simply take it

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.790 
you have a capo you can simply take it
off<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.670> learn<00:00:47.820> how<00:00:48.059> to<00:00:48.090> play<00:00:48.360> with<00:00:48.539> me<00:00:48.660> if<00:00:48.899> you

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
off to learn how to play with me if you

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.819 
off to learn how to play with me if you
don't<00:00:50.160> have<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.460> capo<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.870> can't<00:00:52.170> put<00:00:52.469> one<00:00:52.590> on

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
don't have a capo you can't put one on

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.470 
don't have a capo you can't put one on
to<00:00:53.129> learn<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.370> play<00:00:53.550> with<00:00:53.670> me<00:00:53.789> if<00:00:53.969> I<00:00:54.059> chose<00:00:54.329> to

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
to learn to play with me if I chose to

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.170 
to learn to play with me if I chose to
play<00:00:54.629> with<00:00:54.840> the<00:00:54.960> capo<00:00:55.350> reason<00:00:56.219> number<00:00:56.370> two<00:00:56.699> it

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
play with the capo reason number two it

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.630 
play with the capo reason number two it
doesn't<00:00:57.600> really<00:00:57.780> matter<00:00:58.199> if<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:59.160> play<00:00:59.370> with

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
doesn't really matter if you play with

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.310 
doesn't really matter if you play with
or<00:00:59.760> without<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.090> capo<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.719> only<00:01:00.960> difference

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
or without the capo the only difference

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.470 
or without the capo the only difference
it<00:01:01.469> makes<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.980> if<00:01:02.430> you're<00:01:02.550> playing<00:01:02.850> with<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
it makes is if you're playing with the

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.530 
it makes is if you're playing with the
song<00:01:03.719> or<00:01:04.049> just<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:05.220> your<00:01:05.400> own<00:01:05.580> key<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.390> lot

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
song or just to your own key and a lot

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.719 
song or just to your own key and a lot
of<00:01:06.659> singers<00:01:06.979> have<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.130> change<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.549> key

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
of singers have to change the key

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.450 
of singers have to change the key
anyways<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.900> really<00:01:10.500> does<00:01:10.770> not<00:01:10.950> matter<00:01:11.250> if

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
anyways so it really does not matter if

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.130 
anyways so it really does not matter if
you<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> cable<00:01:11.970> or<00:01:12.180> not<00:01:12.330> these<00:01:12.990> are<00:01:13.110> the
