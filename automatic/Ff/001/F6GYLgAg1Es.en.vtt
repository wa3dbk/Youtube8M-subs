just been using my part and two and I

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.600 
just been using my part and two and I
just<00:02:14.870> left<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.409> little<00:02:15.530> straight<00:02:15.860> bitch<00:02:16.129> and

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
just left a little straight bitch and

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:18.369 
just left a little straight bitch and
it's<00:02:16.879> been<00:02:17.030> coming<00:02:17.180> in<00:02:17.480> I'm<00:02:17.689> lean<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.200> down

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:18.379 
it's been coming in I'm lean and down

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.589 
it's been coming in I'm lean and down
making<00:02:19.099> a<00:02:19.430> straight<00:02:19.879> channel<00:02:20.299> but<00:02:20.420> while

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
making a straight channel but while

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:22.240 
making a straight channel but while
there's<00:02:20.840> still<00:02:20.959> bit<00:02:21.290> mass<00:02:21.590> here<00:02:21.890> I'm<00:02:22.069> actually

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
there's still bit mass here I'm actually

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.809 
there's still bit mass here I'm actually
gonna<00:02:22.549> sand<00:02:22.909> this<00:02:23.260> because<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:25.340> fork-tender

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
gonna sand this because the fork-tender

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.119 
gonna sand this because the fork-tender
we<00:02:26.060> get<00:02:26.269> this<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.629> more<00:02:26.810> likely<00:02:27.200> it's<00:02:27.319> going

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
we get this the more likely it's going

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:29.979 
we get this the more likely it's going
so<00:02:28.489> you<00:02:28.610> want<00:02:28.819> to<00:02:28.909> give<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.209> a<00:02:29.269> sign<00:02:29.599> than<00:02:29.810> air

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
so you want to give this a sign than air

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:31.360 
so you want to give this a sign than air
while<00:02:30.230> there's<00:02:30.409> still<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.620> good<00:02:30.860> bit<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:31.069> mass

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
while there's still a good bit of mass

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:39.369 
while there's still a good bit of mass
here<00:02:37.420> all<00:02:38.420> right<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:38.720> I've<00:02:38.840> never<00:02:39.049> finished

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
here all right so I've never finished

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.929 
here all right so I've never finished
and<00:02:39.560> then<00:02:39.739> I'm<00:02:39.950> just<00:02:40.190> showing<00:02:40.549> you<00:02:40.579> how<00:02:40.760> to<00:02:40.790> use

00:02:40.929 --> 00:02:40.939 
and then I'm just showing you how to use

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.089 
and then I'm just showing you how to use
the<00:02:41.090> part<00:02:41.359> until<00:02:41.689> so<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:41.930> go<00:02:42.170> in<00:02:42.349> and<00:02:43.040> then

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
the part until so I go in and then

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.119 
the part until so I go in and then
plunge<00:02:43.609> down<00:02:44.170> but<00:02:45.170> you<00:02:45.290> have<00:02:45.500> to<00:02:45.680> be<00:02:45.799> slow

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
plunge down but you have to be slow

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.349 
plunge down but you have to be slow
because<00:02:46.400> we<00:02:46.549> can<00:02:46.790> hear<00:02:46.940> the<00:02:47.090> vibrations

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
because we can hear the vibrations

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.970 
because we can hear the vibrations
alright<00:02:50.359> so<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.599> can<00:02:50.659> now<00:02:50.959> see<00:02:50.989> how<00:02:51.500> low<00:02:51.769> I've

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
alright so you can now see how low I've

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.710 
alright so you can now see how low I've
just<00:02:52.250> turn<00:02:52.519> this<00:02:52.760> so<00:02:52.970> what<00:02:53.150> I'm<00:02:53.269> now<00:02:53.450> about<00:02:53.569> to

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
just turn this so what I'm now about to

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.839

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:02.050 
do is I'm just better to get my flush
cuts<00:02:56.120> off<00:02:57.879> but<00:02:58.879> down<00:02:59.120> like<00:02:59.359> that<00:03:01.030> make<00:03:02.030> a

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
cuts off but down like that make a

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.330 
cuts off but down like that make a
little<00:03:02.389> score<00:03:02.690> and<00:03:02.989> then<00:03:03.650> turn<00:03:03.980> the<00:03:04.159> light<00:03:04.310> off

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
little score and then turn the light off

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.770 
little score and then turn the light off
simply<00:03:05.260> and<00:03:06.579> this<00:03:07.579> is<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.819> way<00:03:07.940> I<00:03:07.970> prefer<00:03:08.329> dish
