views that I wouldn't live in freer ends
I<00:00:23.800> don't<00:00:24.130> think<00:00:24.220> Harrison<00:00:24.940> should<00:00:25.090> have<00:00:25.180> been

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
I don't think Harrison should have been

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.210 
I don't think Harrison should have been
allowed<00:00:25.480> to<00:00:25.539> fight<00:00:25.869> for<00:00:26.050> the<00:00:26.110> world<00:00:26.320> title

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:27.220 
allowed to fight for the world title

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.820 
allowed to fight for the world title
I<00:00:27.280> think<00:00:27.910> it's<00:00:28.150> an<00:00:28.240> indictment<00:00:28.539> on<00:00:28.900> the<00:00:28.960> WBA

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
I think it's an indictment on the WBA

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.000 
I think it's an indictment on the WBA
the<00:00:30.100> sanction<00:00:30.520> net<00:00:30.789> that's<00:00:31.240> fine<00:00:31.510> but<00:00:32.289> it<00:00:32.890> was

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
the sanction net that's fine but it was

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.799 
the sanction net that's fine but it was
a<00:00:33.039> fight<00:00:33.280> the<00:00:33.399> British<00:00:33.609> public<00:00:33.730> demanded<00:00:34.420> and

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:34.809 
a fight the British public demanded and

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:36.059 
a fight the British public demanded and
really<00:00:35.199> the<00:00:35.289> British<00:00:35.499> probably<00:00:35.800> got<00:00:35.949> what

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:36.069 
really the British probably got what

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:37.829 
really the British probably got what
they<00:00:36.190> demanded<00:00:36.699> you<00:00:37.210> think<00:00:37.420> the<00:00:37.510> public

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:37.839 
they demanded you think the public

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.139 
they demanded you think the public
generally<00:00:38.289> will<00:00:38.409> feel<00:00:38.620> very<00:00:38.859> cheated<00:00:39.339> oh<00:00:39.519> I

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
generally will feel very cheated oh I

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.209 
generally will feel very cheated oh I
don't<00:00:40.269> see<00:00:40.479> it<00:00:40.629> I<00:00:40.960> think<00:00:41.260> they<00:00:41.589> will<00:00:41.710> but<00:00:42.129> I've

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
don't see it I think they will but I've

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:43.649 
don't see it I think they will but I've
only<00:00:42.280> got<00:00:42.399> theirselves<00:00:42.729> to<00:00:42.879> blame<00:00:42.969> because<00:00:43.269> it

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
only got theirselves to blame because it

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:45.149 
only got theirselves to blame because it
what<00:00:43.899> the<00:00:44.019> fight<00:00:44.229> was<00:00:44.379> false<00:00:44.620> by<00:00:44.800> public

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:45.159 
what the fight was false by public

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:47.759 
what the fight was false by public
demand<00:00:45.489> it<00:00:46.179> was<00:00:46.929> but<00:00:47.199> of<00:00:47.319> course<00:00:47.499> had<00:00:47.739> you

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:47.769 
demand it was but of course had you

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:49.559 
demand it was but of course had you
promoted<00:00:48.429> it<00:00:48.550> I<00:00:48.699> guess<00:00:49.030> you<00:00:49.059> would<00:00:49.329> have<00:00:49.359> gone

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:49.569 
promoted it I guess you would have gone

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:50.419 
promoted it I guess you would have gone
along<00:00:49.870> with<00:00:49.929> it

00:00:50.419 --> 00:00:50.429 
along with it

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.139 
along with it
understandably<00:00:51.429> because<00:00:51.609> that's<00:00:51.969> your<00:00:52.089> job

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
understandably because that's your job

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.569 
understandably because that's your job
to<00:00:52.359> make<00:00:52.600> money<00:00:52.870> the<00:00:53.739> job<00:00:53.920> of<00:00:53.949> the<00:00:54.100> newspapers

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:54.579 
to make money the job of the newspapers

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:55.889 
to make money the job of the newspapers
is<00:00:54.670> well<00:00:54.819> -<00:00:54.969> right<00:00:55.089> I<00:00:55.149> mean<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.449> newsmakers

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
is well - right I mean the newsmakers

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:01.229 
are all writing up babies there Harrison
had<00:00:58.420> a<00:00:58.449> chance<00:00:59.100> do<00:01:00.100> you<00:01:00.159> think<00:01:00.249> that<00:01:00.699> his<00:01:00.850> only

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
had a chance do you think that his only

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.329 
had a chance do you think that his only
chance<00:01:01.479> was<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.989> lucky<00:01:02.260> punch<00:01:02.440> I<00:01:02.679> remember

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
chance was the lucky punch I remember

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:04.950 
chance was the lucky punch I remember
being<00:01:03.519> with<00:01:03.760> you<00:01:03.909> and<00:01:03.940> it<00:01:04.479> sort<00:01:04.659> of<00:01:04.689> in<00:01:04.839> the

being with you and it sort of in the

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.990 
being with you and it sort of in the
corner<00:01:05.110> when<00:01:05.439> Lennox<00:01:05.890> Lewis<00:01:06.039> lost<00:01:06.490> the<00:01:06.670> McCall

and<00:01:07.030> and<00:01:07.570> Rockman<00:01:07.990> in<00:01:08.110> South<00:01:08.350> Africa<00:01:08.829> do<00:01:09.340> you

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
and and Rockman in South Africa do you

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.670 
and and Rockman in South Africa do you
think<00:01:09.729> that<00:01:10.030> really<00:01:10.329> his<00:01:10.780> only<00:01:11.140> chance

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
think that really his only chance

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.770 
think that really his only chance
Harrison's<00:01:12.549> only<00:01:12.789> chance<00:01:13.030> was<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.479> was<00:01:13.630> the

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
Harrison's only chance was that was the
