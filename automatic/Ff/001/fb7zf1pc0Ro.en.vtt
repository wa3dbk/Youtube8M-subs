00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.600
 'Handsome Cristiano' 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.400
 Cristiano, run more! 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.000
 You tell me because I'm handsome. 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.900
 No. I'm telling you to run more. 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:15.150
 Yes, yes, of course. Maasz ... 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.300
 Do not give me your signed photo again. You have given them 250 of them in the last 3 days. 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.600
 Yes, and you are constantly trying to get my attention. 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.300
 Okay, you have another photo. 

00:00:27.307 --> 00:00:29.807
 Mister, what's wrong with you? You are disgusted. 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.600
 Cristiano ... He thinks he is so handsome that he does not have to listen to anyone. 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.850
 Man, the truth is that it's good, if it were not for the fact that I'm a guy ... 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:38.200
 Znaaczy, I wanted to say yes, you are right ......... 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.870
 I do not know what to do anymore, I tried 100 different types of screams, but ... 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.680
 Relax, leave it to me. But how handsome is he nibbled! 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.800
 You'll see what I did to him when he slept down the siesta. 

00:00:49.575 --> 00:00:50.075
 Good day. 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.400
 Oh no!!! You are disfigured! 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.600
 Di Maria, they call you! 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 No, no, I'm talking to you. You have something on your face. 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.100
 Do you mean a charming smile? 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:58.700
 Except. Look only. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.200
 What did you do to me?!?!?! 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.000
 You will not be able to laugh at my beard anymore. 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.300
 Not from my mounds. 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:04.700
 Not from my hair. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.500
 Marcelo, do not be offended, but it would be better if you cut them down. 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.760
 It is... 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000
 It is... 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.700
 GREAT!!! 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.900
 Cooooooo? 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.100
 My trend has recently started to get a bit boring, but thanks to my career will enter new tracks, 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.300
 The companies will beat me again. I am introducing the fashion for REMOVE YOUR FACE AS KRISTIANO! 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.600
 No no! It seemed that you would be offended at it for sure. 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.600
 Just! 

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:25.055
 Marcelo, seriously, cut the hair. 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.300
 Take offense? I have to thank you for that! 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.700
 And just, I'm going to take pictures with my new 'look' 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 And everything went the other way round. He made fashion. 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.400
 And I think that it's me to tavira. 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.900
 Mmmm ... Marceeelo ... nothing. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
 Yes? 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.100
 Andrea, is it you? 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 hehehe, this weekend was not bad, huh? 

00:01:51.267 --> 00:01:52.770
 What are you talking about, after all Madrid did not compete in anything. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.200
 No, Madrid is not, but who won the Formula One World Championship? 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:56.100
 Vettel. 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.400
 Who lost them? 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.150
 He lost? Alonso. 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.300
 And who is Alonso for? 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.400
 For Mad ... Are you just calling me to laugh at Alonso who lost the championship because he is Real Madrid? 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.300
 You are knocked down! 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.500
 He can not lose.
