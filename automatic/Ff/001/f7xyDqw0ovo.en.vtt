as October's don't end up this is a 2000
this<00:01:25.729> is<00:01:25.909> God<00:01:26.120> I<00:01:26.150> believe<00:01:26.890> is<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:32.119> horsepower

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
this is God I believe is the horsepower

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.950 
this is God I believe is the horsepower
I<00:01:32.810> think<00:01:33.050> it's<00:01:33.170> like<00:01:33.350> mine<00:01:34.070> is<00:01:34.310> 125<00:01:34.970> or<00:01:35.240> 115<00:01:35.780> so

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
I think it's like mine is 125 or 115 so

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.170 
I think it's like mine is 125 or 115 so
I<00:01:35.990> think<00:01:36.110> this<00:01:36.290> is<00:01:36.350> like<00:01:37.930> like<00:01:38.930> hundred

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
I think this is like like hundred

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:49.340 
I think this is like like hundred
hundred<00:01:41.180> horsepower
