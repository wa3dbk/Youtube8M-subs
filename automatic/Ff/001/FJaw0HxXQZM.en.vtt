00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.840
 hello we are still on the move 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:10.220
 world congress of barcelona and 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.049
 now we are not going to talk about 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.879
 products and technologies and 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.349
 batteries and in particular from 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.520
 the autonomy of smartphones and 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.500
 connected objects connected objects 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.860
 that are all the rage this year on the web 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.720
 progressing 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.520
 the problem of these connected objects and 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.350
 are often smartphones it's 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.300
 to have a one-day autonomy at 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.790
 better two days is what we 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.540
 today proposes two companies on the 

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.670
 living room 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.010
 it is a future more or less close where 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:36.260
 we will not need to reload 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.879
 mobile or its connected object and the small 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.519
 bonus is that these companies are 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:43.039
 we are here at sun partners 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.140
 technology a company founded in 2008 

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:46.850
 and based in Aix en Provence which manufactures 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.589
 photovoltaic transparent screens 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.079
 who are able to store the 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.120
 daylight or interior for 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.530
 charge the batteries of a phone or 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.629
 of a connected world what you see 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.460
 behind me are the last screens 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.089
 that sun partner is able to 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.539
 commercialize 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:04.100
 it darkens 0.5 mm thick they have 90% 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.290
 transparency and we are able 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.969
 Today integrate watches 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.430
 connected or smartphones 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:12.350
 we are takers and already have two teams 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.100
 smartphones that are not yet on the 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.020
 market 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.570
 what in the cera that will soon come out a 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.009
 waterproof shockproof smartphone 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.780
 but also who is capable of 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:22.789
 recharge to light and an alcatel one 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.689
 touch that the mark had used the year 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.270
 last to do demonstrations 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:30.170
 on the on the 2014 fair 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.850
 so as you can see from 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:36.820
 we put the smartphone under good 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.820
 light it begins to load and draws 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.270
 in addition to smartphones are partners 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.560
 will also be integrating soon in 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.420
 connected watches here what can 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.790
 see her boobs reference design that 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.720
 the company has done to demonstrate this 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.060
 that he was able to do 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.220
 so there we see once that the show 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.270
 light a little green dot that we 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.040
 indicates that showed it in the process of 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.530
 load in addition to ass to cera that is 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.729
 him a real product except mar content will be 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.290
 also present in a watch 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.899
 connected too a real product that 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.640
 is there the neva watch has produced French 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.380
 part of the French funded by the 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.769
 crowdfunding platform 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.970
 indie gogo a few weeks ago 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.070
 so this is the watch connect with 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.670
 needles but if sensors from 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:20.120
 business 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.629
 andy able to have that's his 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.239
 results of the day so this is a 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.830
 solar version will be released in September this 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.480
 will be a screen sounds partner who will by 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.370
 above and so this watch will no longer have 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.989
 need to be recharged or remember without 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.580
 doubt matrix or we humans we 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.379
 were transformed into a stack for 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.170
 machines and well that's maybe the 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:40.940
 first step since it perpetuated 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.739
 stmicroelectronics another company 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.569
 French allows to feed a 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.400
 battery through body heat 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.659
 this technology powers a battery 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.239
 who will she do her drums work 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:53.209
 that is, to supply energy to a 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.440
 object connected a watch no matter and 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:56.239
 batteries powered by heat 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.069
 body for the moment it's the future 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.129
 today what is micro and capable 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.549
 to do that is an ultra battery 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.549
 flat 

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.700
 who is able to feed an object 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.590
 connected for a month after only 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.000
 half an hour charge the famous 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.360
 bracelet that is powered during a 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.850
 month 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.470
 It's This one 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.200
 here we might think it's a 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:21.640
 false but no it is powered by seven 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.640
 by the little battery that is here 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:27.510
 he's looking for himself on a dock when we can 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.739
 see it an e-ink screen 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.050
 which displays hours it's a watch 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.940
 ultra flat 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.170
 which is technology shielded to 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.170
 the interior that we do not see
