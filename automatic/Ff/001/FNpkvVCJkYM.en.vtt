00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.090
 Welcome friends to the pay news today 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.069
 is it, among other things , completely again 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.109
 many interesting topics and we 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.910
 start with the computer company apple 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.950
 he has an economic record 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.809
 he just really is 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.969
 really remarkable you have to 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.760
 say then it's about a very much too 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.560
 impressive technology 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.330
 demonstration video based on the anvil 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.080
 engine 4 of a french level 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.160
 designers and environmentalists 3 because there 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.529
 it will probably be one 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.240
 give difficulty the call yourself 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.980
 crazy and probably will 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:44.730
 also be mad that right now 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:46.129
 within their use we start the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.000
 Today's news with a huge 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:49.950
 computer company and no the speech is 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.719
 not from microsoft but from apple 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.719
 because apple is actually in the now 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.489
 entered into economic history and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.010
 has set a huge record 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.739
 and indeed you could in the last quarter 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:05.580
 alone in the last quarter a profit 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.070
 So a surplus of more than 18 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.530
 make billions of dollars 18 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.680
 billion dollars is now available 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.930
 The Russian natural gas company Gazprom with 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.820
 16 2 billion dollars now too 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.049
 not necessarily a little outdated and 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.460
 clearly beaten 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.500
 You have to see that for the first time 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:28.080
 This is an increase in sales 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.850
 30 percent to 74 6 billion dollars 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.470
 So sales and that was natural 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.240
 Of course, you always have to profit 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.759
 so keep a little in front of eyes and 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.890
 of course , the sales of the 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.049
 iphones or iphone 6 and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.549
 the iphone 6 plus one not quite 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.729
 insignificant role 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.470
 because in total now so have been 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.439
 the two of them came out 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.570
 two smartphones more than 74 5 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.630
 So millions of copies are almost sold 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.369
 75 million copies of the iphine that 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.540
 is just a time you can get in 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.079
 do not even imagine 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.969
 That's more than 23 4 million copies 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.280
 more than in the last year of the 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.560
 iphones and of course accordingly 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.630
 the share has also risen by around 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.460
 five percent to a total of 115 usd 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.000
 Of course, there will be the 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:18.760
 shareholders are pleased and overall that is 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.890
 in the last year already by 40 percent 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.980
 So you should be promoted as a shareholder 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.690
 maybe consider the shares of 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.830
 to invest apple i think so 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.120
 then do the same now 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:30.010
 By the way, you're probably wondering now 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.470
 how does it look like many iphones 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.930
 were then within an hour 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.670
 sold on average and naturally 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.590
 I can tell you that now in the 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.380
 Period from the beginning of October to the end 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:45.220
 december were in every hour in each 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.040
 hour more than 30,000 smartphones 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.900
 which sells more smartphones than 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.940
 TV sets you have to first 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.820
 conception as said so goes apple 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.710
 into the economic history and me 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.780
 I'm curious if this is a company 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:01.230
 can crack now so fast again 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:03.490
 record this incredible what do you mean 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.040
 you want the ultimate challenge 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.350
 then maybe you should experience yourself 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.790
 times as authoritative three wild hunt look at because 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.590
 even the first two parts because they 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.360
 definitely known for that 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.580
 was particularly easy 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.740
 and also far hand should accordingly 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.770
 keep something in the backhand resp 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:22.830
 a difficulty called 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:25.810
 insane of roleplaying 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.310
 Veterans directed and considered 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.680
 currently with the developers the 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.320
 work out the mode just now 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.750
 if you do not maybe by magnet 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.940
 So you build in with that 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.280
 dodge gerald automatically too 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.050
 lose his score and that 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.880
 I think is a little annoying 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.590
 an action roleplay where you loose 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.400
 invest 100 hours or more 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.470
 can 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.420
 The developers now have that within 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.220
 of a live-stream betray the front 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.540
 has taken place there a few days 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.580
 new was new gameplay material 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.500
 showed and there were also quite a lot 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.360
 Questions from the community answered 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.490
 and I have to say that's on everyone 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.750
 case very interesting I will 

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.790
 probably not to the genus 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.459
 Players are one of those modes 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:08.709
 but I think I can play when 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.820
 Some will be happy about it and some will 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.060
 probably also your computer 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.860
 throwing a lot of frustration out of the window 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:16.109
 if anything happens to me this morning 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.090
 really intrigued has except the tat 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.870
 there looked in the mirror but that 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.639
 is another thing 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.930
 no, of course not then it is up 

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:23.280
 in any case, the video that you 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.610
 probably already see 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.430
 and that is the video respectively 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.770
 is it possible to call the game I know 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:33.389
 It is not a technique 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.690
 demonstration of the french 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:37.710
 leveldesigner sparrow based on the 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.040
 people 4 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.570
 and there he has a fictional Parisian 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:44.310
 Apartment reconstructed 

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.360
 among other things, I must briefly at the end 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.680
 He still has to say in recent years 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:49.410
 Years including titles like 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.419
 dishonored hv 2 casino online and left 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.919
 worked for dead and within 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.310
 he shows this video 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:58.320
 Fictional Parisian appartement based 

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:00.060
 the people 4 and I really was 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.820
 impressed because not only in the first 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.800
 moment you think it is really a 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:05.940
 appartement through which you just straight 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.350
 with a camera goes through too 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:08.669
 second moment you think it is always 

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:10.380
 another appartement through the man 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:11.760
 just goes through with the camera and 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.500
 if you are watching the game scenes right now 

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:16.560
 See, you are probably too 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.720
 in my opinion and as I said only topic 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.430
 photorealism it's unbelievable how 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.930
 far the technique is I would now 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:23.070
 like to know on which calculator that 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.300
 I have not even looked at it now 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.979
 maybe that's on his side 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.750
 Anyway, I would definitely 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.100
 like to know your opinion on skin 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:29.789
 just below the videos in 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:33.510
 the comments 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:35.490
 and yes, we have the first moment of the video 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.690
 if you have believed that 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:39.270
 is really true now or that is 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.580
 really graphic is really 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.020
 impressive and if you look forward to it 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.460
 waves as many years mandant 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:48.020
 really can go through his apartment 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.020
 within a game 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.560
 last but not least a little bit 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.380
 self-promotion yes you can do it sometimes 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:58.080
 because on play nation points there are 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:00.120

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:01.440
 female title trend gives me yes 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:03.150
 now already started too 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.060
 let's play a really interesting one 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.800
 title of the potential really much 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.170
 has potential and not just one 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:12.810
 before it's time to give up , it's just time 

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:14.460
 watch if you have the title yes 

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:17.640

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:19.200
 euro also buy as the access and yes 

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:20.790
 read the preview times or 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.290
 through my last jan or vom

 reason of butcher started to do so 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:27.300
 or started from the juca of the play and 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.590
 I really enjoyed this game 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.930
 If you like it on one 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:34.710
