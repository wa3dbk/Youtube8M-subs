flat<00:02:04.399> this<00:02:05.399> moves<00:02:05.670> up<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.060> down<00:02:09.590> adjusted

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
flat this moves up and down adjusted

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.770 
flat this moves up and down adjusted
you're<00:02:10.679> calling<00:02:10.979> with<00:02:11.009> this<00:02:11.370> mazels<00:02:12.030> moves<00:02:12.630> it

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
you're calling with this mazels moves it

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.069 
you're calling with this mazels moves it
up<00:02:12.930> and<00:02:13.109> down<00:02:13.230> then<00:02:13.500> when<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.650> tighten<00:02:13.890> it

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:15.079 
up and down then when you tighten it

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:21.500 
up and down then when you tighten it
can't<00:02:16.079> move<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.380> up<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.680> down<00:02:19.820> this<00:02:20.820> one<00:02:21.329> I

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
can't move it up and down this one I

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.800 
can't move it up and down this one I
guess<00:02:22.370> I'm<00:02:23.370> not<00:02:23.549> sure<00:02:24.799> quite<00:02:25.799> a<00:02:25.950> few<00:02:26.570> this<00:02:27.570> one

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
guess I'm not sure quite a few this one

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.729 
guess I'm not sure quite a few this one
I<00:02:28.019> believe<00:02:28.530> does<00:02:29.180> this<00:02:30.180> one<00:02:30.510> so<00:02:31.440> it's<00:02:31.590> pretty

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
I believe does this one so it's pretty

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:41.360 
I believe does this one so it's pretty
small<00:02:35.750> small<00:02:38.120> should<00:02:39.120> fit<00:02:39.390> most<00:02:39.750> cameras<00:02:40.530> but

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
small small should fit most cameras but

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.880 
small small should fit most cameras but
again<00:02:41.579> like<00:02:41.760> I<00:02:41.880> said<00:02:41.940> the<00:02:42.420> legs<00:02:42.720> feel<00:02:43.470> kind<00:02:43.829> of

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
again like I said the legs feel kind of

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.150 
again like I said the legs feel kind of
unstable<00:02:44.430> so<00:02:45.170> use<00:02:46.170> your<00:02:46.380> digital<00:02:46.560> camera<00:02:47.040> but

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
unstable so use your digital camera but

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.319 
unstable so use your digital camera but
I<00:02:47.190> wouldn't<00:02:47.519> suggest<00:02:47.760> using<00:02:48.150> a<00:02:48.390> DSLR<00:02:50.120> sure<00:02:51.120> it

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
I wouldn't suggest using a DSLR sure it

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:57.229 
I wouldn't suggest using a DSLR sure it
is<00:02:51.650> unboxed<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.769> I<00:02:52.829> like<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.130> package<00:02:56.150> so<00:02:57.150> as

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
is unboxed and I like the package so as

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.809 
is unboxed and I like the package so as
you<00:02:57.329> can<00:02:57.450> see<00:02:57.690> when<00:02:57.959> I<00:02:57.989> compare<00:02:58.380> that<00:02:58.590> my<00:02:59.519> old

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
you can see when I compare that my old

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.819 
you can see when I compare that my old
tripod<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.630> the<00:03:00.720> new<00:03:00.840> tripod<00:03:01.170> it's<00:03:01.530> much

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
tripod to the new tripod it's much

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.490 
tripod to the new tripod it's much
smaller<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.459> what<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.299> think<00:03:04.019> it's<00:03:04.170> good<00:03:04.410> in

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
smaller and what I think it's good in

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.240 
smaller and what I think it's good in
this<00:03:04.650> sense<00:03:04.829> it's<00:03:05.160> much<00:03:05.459> more<00:03:05.639> portable<00:03:07.250> but

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
this sense it's much more portable but

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:11.059 
this sense it's much more portable but
as<00:03:08.430> I<00:03:08.760> mentioned<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.540> legs<00:03:09.810> they<00:03:10.500> extend<00:03:10.920> out

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
as I mentioned the legs they extend out

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.260 
as I mentioned the legs they extend out
and<00:03:11.100> they're<00:03:11.400> kind<00:03:11.639> of

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
and they're kind of

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.280 
and they're kind of
unstable<00:03:14.030> see<00:03:15.030> if<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.180> can<00:03:15.390> show<00:03:15.720> you<00:03:15.780> I'm

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
unstable see if I can show you I'm

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
talking so you can kind of see I can

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.470 
talking so you can kind of see I can

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:58.010 
besides wise comes with the bag so
here's<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.570> tripod<00:03:45.570> when<00:03:45.810> it's<00:03:45.990> fully

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.280 

fully-assembled<00:03:59.660> was<00:04:00.660> already<00:04:00.930> assembled

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
fully-assembled was already assembled

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.080 
fully-assembled was already assembled
but<00:04:01.440> I'm<00:04:01.590> just<00:04:01.710> saying<00:04:01.920> when<00:04:02.040> it's<00:04:02.250> extended

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
but I'm just saying when it's extended

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.170 
but I'm just saying when it's extended
all<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.420> way<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.780> you<00:04:03.840> compare<00:04:04.170> it<00:04:04.260> to<00:04:05.180> this

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
all the way and you compare it to this

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.150 
all the way and you compare it to this
tripod<00:04:06.870> my<00:04:07.830> old<00:04:08.040> tripod<00:04:08.690> is<00:04:09.690> pretty<00:04:10.110> stable<00:04:10.380> at

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
tripod my old tripod is pretty stable at

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.570 
tripod my old tripod is pretty stable at
this<00:04:11.310> one<00:04:12.470> just<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.680> centre<00:04:13.920> of<00:04:14.010> gravity<00:04:14.190> is

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
this one just the centre of gravity is

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.720 
this one just the centre of gravity is
so<00:04:14.970> high<00:04:15.180> kind<00:04:15.930> of<00:04:16.020> feels<00:04:16.230> unstable<00:04:16.620> wish<00:04:17.550> it

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
so high kind of feels unstable wish it

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:21.950 
so high kind of feels unstable wish it
would<00:04:17.880> have<00:04:17.970> had<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.180> wider<00:04:18.480> base<00:04:20.960> so

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
would have had a wider base so

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:26.120 
would have had a wider base so
definitely<00:04:24.020> it's<00:04:25.020> okay<00:04:25.320> if<00:04:25.380> we're<00:04:25.620> using<00:04:25.740> for

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
definitely it's okay if we're using for

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:28.540 
definitely it's okay if we're using for
digital<00:04:26.610> camera<00:04:26.970> use<00:04:27.180> I'm<00:04:27.510> kind<00:04:27.870> of<00:04:27.960> worried

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
digital camera use I'm kind of worried

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.450 
digital camera use I'm kind of worried
if<00:04:29.550> you<00:04:29.670> use<00:04:29.850> it<00:04:30.000> outside<00:04:30.150> it<00:04:30.870> might<00:04:31.460> might

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
if you use it outside it might might

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.390 
if you use it outside it might might
possibly<00:04:32.700> blow<00:04:33.150> away<00:04:33.320> is<00:04:34.320> it<00:04:34.470> so<00:04:34.650> light<00:04:34.950> and

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
possibly blow away is it so light and

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.990 
possibly blow away is it so light and
like<00:04:36.030> I<00:04:36.180> said<00:04:36.950> but<00:04:37.950> still<00:04:37.980> it's<00:04:38.520> definitely

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
like I said but still it's definitely

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.140 
like I said but still it's definitely
usable<00:04:39.360> for<00:04:39.860> indoor<00:04:40.860> use<00:04:40.890> which<00:04:41.640> is<00:04:41.820> what's

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150 
usable for indoor use which is what's

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.350 
usable for indoor use which is what's
mainly<00:04:42.510> gonna<00:04:42.630> be<00:04:42.810> used<00:04:43.020> for
