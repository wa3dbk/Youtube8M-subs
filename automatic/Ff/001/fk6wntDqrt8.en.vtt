00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.500
 good continuing with the interface here 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:08.050
 we see how the menus move them 

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.850
 completely fluid though it seems like 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.820
 that goes a little softer this is 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.240
 google has wanted transitions 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.789
 between desks are more fluid more 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.460
 as softer but good this is something 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:24.249
 many say has endorsed the so 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.399
 Yapen especially good now and we will 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:30.130
 change it to go a little more 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.570
 quick the transition to see if I find 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.610
 the options 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.610
 this scale animation 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.170
 here 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.800
 here we do it faster by 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.920
 example there is 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:51.000
 transition scale in animation 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.920
 to 5 well now we're going here goes more 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.800
 slow 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.420
 especially to minimize them to see if what 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.570
 we can see 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.769
 you see is going slower now we are going to 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.769
 make it go faster 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.310
 development functions 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.409
 and then here 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.740
 is what animation are we going to put at 0.5 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.740
 everyone 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.510
 and I do see nothing faster 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.960
 this has more options but good 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.850
 we have is completely fluid 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.070
 and now let's show you a little 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.540
 resolution for you to see for example 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.920
 here we loaded page 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.920
 we can see that zooming 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.000
 zooming because I did not know a pixel 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.290
 in the middle 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.290
 to see what focus the camera 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:53.500
 for the rock 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.370
 good 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.590
 these problems of taking the nexus 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.380
 that is a bit brown but good here 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.140
 we see how focused it is now 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.270
 fucking mother the screen 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.220
 and good to little more if you have any 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.950
 doubt then do not want to leave us in the 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.959
 comments and we will answer them as soon as 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.959
 possible a greeting see you later
