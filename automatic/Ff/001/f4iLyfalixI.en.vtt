00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
we were able to create these stories

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.300 
we were able to create these stories
that<00:03:36.959> maybe<00:03:37.140> aren't<00:03:37.410> able<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.709> happen<00:03:37.920> and

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
that maybe aren't able to happen and
