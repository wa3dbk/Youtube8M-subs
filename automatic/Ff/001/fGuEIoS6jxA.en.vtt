00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
be doing it in extreme advance I think

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.400 
be doing it in extreme advance I think
that<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.000> highest<00:01:00.270> one<00:01:00.600> that<00:01:00.719> they<00:01:00.809> posted<00:01:01.230> is

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
that the highest one that they posted is

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.950 
that the highest one that they posted is
in<00:01:01.920> like<00:01:02.070> four<00:01:02.399> days<00:01:02.640> from<00:01:02.879> now<00:01:03.120> they're

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
in like four days from now they're

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.170 
in like four days from now they're
basically<00:01:04.260> giving<00:01:04.470> all<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> bots<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.519> advance

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
basically giving all the bots in advance

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.410 
basically giving all the bots in advance
notice<00:01:06.630> on<00:01:06.810> when<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.560> bots<00:01:07.770> so<00:01:08.460> that's

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
notice on when not to bots so that's

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.420 
notice on when not to bots so that's
like<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.689> huge<00:01:10.020> flaw<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.439> there<00:01:10.770> I<00:01:10.950> don't<00:01:11.070> I

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
like a huge flaw right there I don't I

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.310 
like a huge flaw right there I don't I
don't<00:01:12.270> really<00:01:12.540> say<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.900> is<00:01:13.049> going<00:01:13.229> to

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
don't really say that this is going to

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.160 
don't really say that this is going to
be<00:01:13.549> doing<00:01:14.549> very<00:01:14.820> much<00:01:14.939> towards<00:01:15.689> killing<00:01:15.960> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
be doing very much towards killing the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.310 
be doing very much towards killing the
bots<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.770> think<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.220> more<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.780> ploy<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:19.049> to

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
bots I think it's more of a ploy just to

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.899 
bots I think it's more of a ploy just to
make<00:01:19.470> it<00:01:19.619> seem<00:01:19.890> like<00:01:19.920> they<00:01:20.220> care<00:01:20.580> about<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
make it seem like they care about the

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.160 
make it seem like they care about the
bots<00:01:21.119> or<00:01:21.420> that<00:01:21.540> they're<00:01:21.689> starting<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:22.049> the

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
bots or that they're starting on the

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.580 
bots or that they're starting on the
process<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.770> getting<00:01:22.920> rid<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.490> bots<00:01:23.700> but

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
process of getting rid of the bots but

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:26.300 
process of getting rid of the bots but
personally<00:01:25.590> I<00:01:25.619> don't<00:01:25.740> think<00:01:25.860> this<00:01:26.070> will<00:01:26.189> do

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
personally I don't think this will do

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.780 
personally I don't think this will do
anything<00:01:26.759> in<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.600> hour<00:01:28.369> over<00:01:29.369> an<00:01:29.490> hour

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
anything in the hour over an hour

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.219 
anything in the hour over an hour
it's<00:01:30.000> actually<00:01:30.240> about<00:01:30.329> an<00:01:30.540> hour<00:01:30.689> and<00:01:30.930> 10

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
it's actually about an hour and 10

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.580 
it's actually about an hour and 10
minutes<00:01:31.439> total<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.920> think<00:01:32.360> he<00:01:33.360> banned<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
minutes total I think he banned a

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.710 
minutes total I think he banned a
hundred<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.310> seventy<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.119> think<00:01:36.479> I<00:01:36.600> don't

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
hundred and seventy I think I don't

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.270 
hundred and seventy I think I don't
remember<00:01:36.840> I'm<00:01:37.380> recording<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.799> voice<00:01:38.009> for

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
remember I'm recording the voice for

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.460 
remember I'm recording the voice for
this<00:01:38.430> video<00:01:38.790> way<00:01:39.060> after<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.570> actual<00:01:39.840> clip<00:01:40.170> so

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470

this video way after the actual clip so
I<00:01:40.850> don't<00:01:41.850> really<00:01:42.000> remember<00:01:42.590> but<00:01:43.590> that's

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
I don't really remember but that's

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.280 
I don't really remember but that's
hardly<00:01:44.070> anything<00:01:44.520> I<00:01:44.640> mean<00:01:44.759> 170<00:01:45.450> bots<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.110> like

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
hardly anything I mean 170 bots in like

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.910 
hardly anything I mean 170 bots in like
over<00:01:46.500> an<00:01:46.680> hour<00:01:46.829> that's<00:01:47.189> that's<00:01:47.850> pretty<00:01:48.420> rough

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
over an hour that's that's pretty rough

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.780 
over an hour that's that's pretty rough
considering<00:01:49.920> how<00:01:50.040> many<00:01:50.100> there<00:01:50.430> are<00:01:50.579> already

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
considering how many there are already

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.289 
considering how many there are already
in<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:52.049> single<00:01:52.380> trip<00:01:52.619> it<00:01:53.280> was<00:01:53.460> with<00:01:53.640> mod<00:01:54.030> Matt

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
in this single trip it was with mod Matt

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.620 
in this single trip it was with mod Matt
Kay<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:55.280> believe<00:01:56.280> he's<00:01:56.460> a<00:01:56.490> old-time<00:01:57.180> Jay<00:01:57.420> mod

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
Kay I believe he's a old-time Jay mod

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.590 
Kay I believe he's a old-time Jay mod
but<00:01:57.930> basically<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.250> was<00:01:59.549> kind<00:02:00.270> of<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.390> huge

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
but basically it was kind of a huge

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.450 
but basically it was kind of a huge
turnout<00:02:00.960> actually<00:02:01.350> what<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.770> was<00:02:01.860> much<00:02:02.040> bigger

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
turnout actually what it was much bigger

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.770 
turnout actually what it was much bigger
than<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.759> thought<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.060> was<00:02:03.210> going<00:02:03.479> to<00:02:03.630> be

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
than I thought it was going to be

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.859 
than I thought it was going to be
because<00:02:04.710> when<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.159> first<00:02:05.759> got<00:02:06.149> there<00:02:06.450> to<00:02:06.750> that

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
because when I first got there to that

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.270 
because when I first got there to that
world<00:02:07.110> which<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.500> only<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:07.799> 20<00:02:08.129> minutes

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
world which is only like 20 minutes

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.940 
world which is only like 20 minutes
before<00:02:08.520> what<00:02:08.759> actually<00:02:09.090> started<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.720> was<00:02:10.709> maybe

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
before what actually started I was maybe

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.680 
before what actually started I was maybe
one<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:11.790> 10<00:02:12.420> people<00:02:12.720> there

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
one of like 10 people there

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.770 
one of like 10 people there
but<00:02:14.020> within<00:02:14.710> like<00:02:15.100> a<00:02:15.370> minute<00:02:15.850> of<00:02:16.180> before<00:02:16.750> like

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
but within like a minute of before like

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.860 
but within like a minute of before like
it's<00:02:17.260> starting<00:02:17.790> there<00:02:18.790> was<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.390> ton<00:02:19.750> of<00:02:19.780> people

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
it's starting there was a ton of people

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.960 
it's starting there was a ton of people
that<00:02:20.290> just<00:02:20.680> all<00:02:20.860> logged<00:02:21.190> in<00:02:21.400> like<00:02:21.640> right

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
that just all logged in like right

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.420 
that just all logged in like right
before<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.420> happened<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:24.040> was<00:02:24.160> kind<00:02:24.370> of

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
before it happened so that was kind of

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.520 
before it happened so that was kind of
weird<00:02:24.670> one<00:02:25.510> thing<00:02:25.660> I<00:02:25.750> did<00:02:25.930> notice<00:02:26.140> though<00:02:26.500> is

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
weird one thing I did notice though is

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.710 
weird one thing I did notice though is
that<00:02:26.920> as<00:02:27.160> soon<00:02:27.400> as<00:02:27.490> he<00:02:27.580> logged<00:02:27.970> in<00:02:28.240> like<00:02:28.510> he<00:02:28.690> was

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
that as soon as he logged in like he was

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.720 
that as soon as he logged in like he was
ready<00:02:29.020> to<00:02:29.200> go<00:02:29.380> like<00:02:29.680> just<00:02:29.980> wanted<00:02:30.310> to<00:02:30.430> get<00:02:30.520> out

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
ready to go like just wanted to get out

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.500 
ready to go like just wanted to get out
of<00:02:30.850> there<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:32.610> then<00:02:33.610> they<00:02:33.730> just<00:02:33.880> left<00:02:34.120> like<00:02:34.480> we

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
of there and then they just left like we

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.990 
of there and then they just left like we
we<00:02:35.110> just<00:02:35.350> all<00:02:35.560> followed<00:02:36.040> him<00:02:36.190> over<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.640> the<00:02:36.880> s

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
we just all followed him over to the s

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000 
we just all followed him over to the s
in<00:02:37.180> spots<00:02:37.420> and<00:02:37.630> that<00:02:38.380> was<00:02:38.530> cool<00:02:38.710> and<00:02:38.860> all<00:02:38.950> but

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
in spots and that was cool and all but

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.680 
in spots and that was cool and all but
the<00:02:39.340> problem<00:02:39.790> I<00:02:39.820> see<00:02:39.850> with<00:02:40.030> that<00:02:40.150> is<00:02:40.270> that<00:02:40.570> if

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
the problem I see with that is that if

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.110 
the problem I see with that is that if
people<00:02:40.720> were<00:02:41.050> like<00:02:41.470> say<00:02:41.890> 30<00:02:42.220> seconds<00:02:42.670> after

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
people were like say 30 seconds after

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.840 
people were like say 30 seconds after
like<00:02:43.390> 30<00:02:43.630> seconds<00:02:43.870> late<00:02:44.170> if<00:02:44.410> you<00:02:44.830> will<00:02:45.010> they

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
like 30 seconds late if you will they

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.370 
like 30 seconds late if you will they
missed<00:02:46.120> out<00:02:46.270> because<00:02:46.660> there'd<00:02:46.840> be<00:02:46.960> no<00:02:47.140> way<00:02:47.320> to

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:47.380 
missed out because there'd be no way to

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.470 
missed out because there'd be no way to
even<00:02:47.590> know<00:02:47.830> where<00:02:48.070> he<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.400> or<00:02:48.640> what<00:02:48.880> J<00:02:49.090> mod<00:02:49.300> was

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
even know where he is or what J mod was

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.720 
even know where he is or what J mod was
actually<00:02:49.750> hosting<00:02:50.200> it<00:02:50.320> so<00:02:50.950> you<00:02:51.460> wouldn't<00:02:51.670> be

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
actually hosting it so you wouldn't be

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.700 
actually hosting it so you wouldn't be
able<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.910> join<00:02:52.030> us<00:02:52.120> see<00:02:52.420> see<00:02:52.660> this<00:02:53.380> is<00:02:53.560> their

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:53.710 
able to join us see see this is their

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.260 
able to join us see see this is their
first<00:02:53.920> one<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:54.370> I'm<00:02:54.460> sure<00:02:54.640> by<00:02:54.790> their<00:02:55.060> last

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
first one and I'm sure by their last

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.790 
first one and I'm sure by their last
they'll<00:02:55.600> have<00:02:55.690> like<00:02:55.930> their<00:02:56.170> little<00:02:56.350> details

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
they'll have like their little details

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.140 
they'll have like their little details
and<00:02:56.920> everything<00:02:57.070> ironed<00:02:57.610> out<00:02:57.700> a<00:02:57.730> little<00:02:57.910> more

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
and everything ironed out a little more

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.000 
and everything ironed out a little more
so<00:02:58.810> it<00:02:58.930> might<00:02:59.020> be<00:02:59.080> a<00:02:59.200> little<00:02:59.380> more<00:02:59.470> efficient

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
so it might be a little more efficient

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.220 
so it might be a little more efficient
it<00:03:00.760> started<00:03:01.030> off<00:03:01.120> pretty<00:03:01.150> entertaining<00:03:01.900> there

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
it started off pretty entertaining there

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.640 
it started off pretty entertaining there
was<00:03:02.350> some<00:03:02.620> weird<00:03:02.890> stuff<00:03:03.190> going<00:03:03.220> on<00:03:04.290> some<00:03:05.290> funny

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
was some weird stuff going on some funny

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.440 
was some weird stuff going on some funny
comments<00:03:06.070> and<00:03:06.160> stuff<00:03:06.280> like<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.580> which

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
comments and stuff like that which

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.290 
comments and stuff like that which
you'll<00:03:07.720> probably<00:03:07.840> see<00:03:08.110> throughout<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.410> video

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
you'll probably see throughout the video

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:12.150 
you'll probably see throughout the video
in<00:03:10.300> a<00:03:10.960> hole<00:03:11.260> though<00:03:11.470> I'd<00:03:11.710> say<00:03:11.890> it<00:03:11.950> was<00:03:12.040> probably

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
in a hole though I'd say it was probably

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.190 
in a hole though I'd say it was probably
pretty<00:03:12.730> boring<00:03:13.060> it<00:03:13.690> was<00:03:13.750> kind<00:03:13.990> of<00:03:14.020> like<00:03:14.140> a

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
pretty boring it was kind of like a

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.910 
pretty boring it was kind of like a
waste<00:03:14.680> of<00:03:14.800> an<00:03:14.920> hour<00:03:15.040> of<00:03:15.280> my<00:03:15.580> time<00:03:15.790> because<00:03:16.920> it

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
waste of an hour of my time because it

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.860 
waste of an hour of my time because it
there<00:03:18.400> was<00:03:18.489> just<00:03:18.670> times<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:19.330> we<00:03:19.750> were

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
there was just times that we were

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:21.930 
there was just times that we were
standing<00:03:20.200> around<00:03:20.440> doing<00:03:20.980> nothing<00:03:21.010> for<00:03:21.370> twenty

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
standing around doing nothing for twenty

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.540 
standing around doing nothing for twenty
minutes<00:03:22.090> plus<00:03:23.040> especially<00:03:24.040> when<00:03:24.190> we<00:03:24.310> went<00:03:24.489> to

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
not doing anything like that kind of

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.430 
not doing anything like that kind of
thing<00:03:46.090> was<00:03:46.239> just<00:03:46.269> a<00:03:46.450> little<00:03:46.660> flame<00:03:47.050> for<00:03:47.380> a

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
thing was just a little flame for a

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.650 
thing was just a little flame for a
while<00:03:47.620> and<00:03:47.920> it<00:03:48.880> was<00:03:49.000> just<00:03:49.120> only<00:03:49.269> getting<00:03:49.510> kind

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
while and it was just only getting kind

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.090 
while and it was just only getting kind
of<00:03:49.690> boring<00:03:49.930> and<00:03:50.080> annoying<00:03:50.200> so<00:03:50.590> I<00:03:50.650> was<00:03:50.800> about<00:03:50.950> to

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
of boring and annoying so I was about to

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.650 
of boring and annoying so I was about to
leave<00:03:51.310> and<00:03:51.610> then<00:03:51.730> we<00:03:51.790> finally<00:03:52.090> what<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.360> use

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
leave and then we finally what to use

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.050 
leave and then we finally what to use
the<00:03:53.320> thing<00:03:53.530> is<00:03:53.709> though<00:03:53.950> kind<00:03:54.610> of<00:03:54.670> backtracking

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
the thing is though kind of backtracking

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.479 
the thing is though kind of backtracking
a<00:03:55.180> little<00:03:55.239> bit<00:03:55.590> the<00:03:56.590> time<00:03:56.890> consuming<00:03:57.340> on

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
a little bit the time consuming on

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.390 
a little bit the time consuming on
banning<00:03:57.730> BOTS<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.269> think<00:03:58.600> is<00:03:58.870> because<00:03:59.380> even<00:04:00.010> as

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
banning BOTS I think is because even as

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.920 
banning BOTS I think is because even as
a<00:04:00.430> J<00:04:00.730> mod<00:04:00.910> I<00:04:01.090> don't<00:04:01.269> think<00:04:01.450> he<00:04:01.510> has<00:04:01.630> full<00:04:01.870> power

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
a J mod I don't think he has full power

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.660 
a J mod I don't think he has full power
that<00:04:02.680> I<00:04:02.920> don't<00:04:03.100> think<00:04:03.220> again<00:04:03.400> just<00:04:03.580> go

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
that I don't think again just go

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.280 
that I don't think again just go
anywhere<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.209> ban<00:04:04.360> anyone<00:04:04.750> I<00:04:04.810> think<00:04:05.080> there's

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
anywhere and ban anyone I think there's

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.259 
anywhere and ban anyone I think there's
like<00:04:05.350> a<00:04:05.410> higher<00:04:05.709> power<00:04:06.070> or<00:04:06.430> like<00:04:06.880> a<00:04:06.910> chain<00:04:07.239> of

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
like a higher power or like a chain of

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.880 
like a higher power or like a chain of
command<00:04:07.510> that<00:04:07.840> he<00:04:08.019> has<00:04:08.170> to<00:04:08.350> run<00:04:08.560> that<00:04:08.709> by

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
command that he has to run that by

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.890 
command that he has to run that by
before<00:04:09.310> he<00:04:09.430> can<00:04:09.580> just<00:04:09.730> make<00:04:09.820> a<00:04:09.970> split-second

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
before he can just make a split-second

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.840 
before he can just make a split-second
decision<00:04:10.930> like<00:04:11.470> that<00:04:11.680> I<00:04:11.890> think<00:04:12.519> they<00:04:12.700> also

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
decision like that I think they also

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.990 
decision like that I think they also
have<00:04:12.970> to<00:04:13.209> be<00:04:13.769> absolutely<00:04:14.769> definite<00:04:15.370> that<00:04:15.519> that

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
have to be absolutely definite that that

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000 
have to be absolutely definite that that
person<00:04:16.330> is<00:04:16.480> botting<00:04:16.870> and<00:04:17.049> that<00:04:17.590> maybe<00:04:17.799> they

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
person is botting and that maybe they

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.680 
person is botting and that maybe they
just<00:04:18.130> don't<00:04:18.310> care<00:04:18.700> that<00:04:19.030> there's<00:04:19.209> a<00:04:19.269> J<00:04:19.510> mod

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
just don't care that there's a J mod

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.640 
just don't care that there's a J mod
nearby<00:04:20.109> or<00:04:20.320> they<00:04:20.470> don't<00:04:20.650> care<00:04:20.919> that<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:22.180> know

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
nearby or they don't care that you know

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.719 
nearby or they don't care that you know
maybe<00:04:23.650> their<00:04:23.830> privates<00:04:24.220> off<00:04:24.310> or<00:04:24.490> something

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
maybe their privates off or something

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.790 
maybe their privates off or something
like<00:04:24.820> that<00:04:24.880> for<00:04:25.630> most<00:04:25.810> people<00:04:26.110> though<00:04:26.260> if<00:04:26.500> you

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
like that for most people though if you

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.629 
like that for most people though if you
saw

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639 
saw

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.219 
saw
you<00:04:28.090> wouldn't<00:04:28.300> just<00:04:28.330> sit<00:04:28.599> there<00:04:28.719> keep<00:04:28.900> picking

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229 
you wouldn't just sit there keep picking

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:30.689 
you wouldn't just sit there keep picking
flax<00:04:29.499> he'd<00:04:29.710> probably<00:04:29.889> go<00:04:30.129> try<00:04:30.370> to<00:04:30.400> talk<00:04:30.669> to

flax he'd probably go try to talk to

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.570 
flax he'd probably go try to talk to
them<00:04:30.969> most<00:04:31.960> people<00:04:32.080> did<00:04:32.560> that<00:04:32.770> we're<00:04:33.159> legit

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580

them most people did that we're legit
there<00:04:33.819> but<00:04:34.509> there<00:04:34.780> were<00:04:34.870> so<00:04:35.110> many<00:04:35.199> people<00:04:35.469> with

ban all of them there and I don't know
the<00:04:53.830> whole<00:04:53.979> process<00:04:54.370> was<00:04:54.729> kind<00:04:54.999> of<00:04:55.180> just

00:04:55.619 --> 00:04:55.629 
the whole process was kind of just

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.469 
the whole process was kind of just
lengthy<00:04:56.080> and<00:04:56.729> there<00:04:57.729> wasn't<00:04:58.029> a<00:04:58.060> whole<00:04:58.240> lot<00:04:58.270> of

mod<00:05:00.939> which<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.330> think<00:05:01.539> is<00:05:01.629> what<00:05:01.750> they're<00:05:01.870> going

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 
mod which I think is what they're going

for<00:05:03.180> well<00:05:04.180> I<00:05:04.210> mean<00:05:04.449> I<00:05:04.629> don't<00:05:04.870> know<00:05:04.960> if<00:05:05.199> I've

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319 
for well I mean I don't know if I've

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.320 
for well I mean I don't know if I've
already<00:05:05.529> said<00:05:05.650> this<00:05:05.770> because<00:05:06.069> I've<00:05:06.520> recorded

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
already said this because I've recorded

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.170 
already said this because I've recorded
this<00:05:07.539> three<00:05:07.719> times<00:05:07.930> now<00:05:08.139> but<00:05:08.889> I<00:05:09.189> don't<00:05:10.000> think

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:10.180 
this three times now but I don't think

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.580 
this three times now but I don't think
that<00:05:10.360> they<00:05:10.449> really<00:05:10.479> care<00:05:10.930> about<00:05:11.050> the<00:05:11.199> bots<00:05:11.409> I

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
that they really care about the bots I

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:12.629 
that they really care about the bots I
think<00:05:11.800> that<00:05:11.919> they're<00:05:12.039> just<00:05:12.189> trying<00:05:12.340> to<00:05:12.460> make

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
think that they're just trying to make

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.550 
think that they're just trying to make
it<00:05:12.759> seem<00:05:13.000> like<00:05:13.029> they<00:05:13.300> care<00:05:13.569> but<00:05:14.139> they<00:05:14.259> also<00:05:14.409> are

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:14.560 
it seem like they care but they also are

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:16.980 
it seem like they care but they also are
trying<00:05:14.710> to<00:05:14.889> fit<00:05:15.069> in<00:05:15.159> some<00:05:15.370> like<00:05:15.750> player<00:05:16.750> to

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
trying to fit in some like player to

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.260 
trying to fit in some like player to
staff<00:05:17.349> interaction<00:05:18.159> which<00:05:18.939> this<00:05:19.120> is<00:05:19.240> a

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
staff interaction which this is a

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:22.230 
staff interaction which this is a
terrible<00:05:19.839> way<00:05:19.900> to<00:05:19.990> go<00:05:20.110> about<00:05:20.439> it<00:05:20.650> because<00:05:21.240> like

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
terrible way to go about it because like

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.999 
terrible way to go about it because like
I<00:05:22.360> said<00:05:22.599> there<00:05:22.779> was<00:05:22.839> most<00:05:23.080> time<00:05:23.349> he<00:05:23.650> wasn't

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
I said there was most time he wasn't

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:25.499 
I said there was most time he wasn't
even<00:05:24.189> talking<00:05:24.370> like<00:05:24.759> it<00:05:24.879> was<00:05:25.000> just<00:05:25.180> completely

00:05:25.499 --> 00:05:25.509 
even talking like it was just completely

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:27.420 
even talking like it was just completely
quiet<00:05:26.289> and<00:05:26.589> I'm<00:05:26.650> sure<00:05:26.800> it<00:05:26.860> was<00:05:26.949> like<00:05:27.099> looking

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
quiet and I'm sure it was like looking

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.189 
quiet and I'm sure it was like looking
into<00:05:27.580> the<00:05:27.729> accounts<00:05:28.150> and<00:05:28.240> stuff<00:05:28.419> like<00:05:28.539> that<00:05:28.719> so

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
into the accounts and stuff like that so

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:31.469 
into the accounts and stuff like that so
that's<00:05:29.379> why<00:05:29.650> but<00:05:30.610> if<00:05:30.849> you're<00:05:30.999> going<00:05:31.120> for<00:05:31.360> like

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
that's why but if you're going for like

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.260 
that's why but if you're going for like
player<00:05:32.099> staff<00:05:33.099> interaction<00:05:33.819> you<00:05:34.060> should<00:05:34.210> go

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:34.270 
player staff interaction you should go

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:37.140 
player staff interaction you should go
play<00:05:34.300> some<00:05:34.689> mini<00:05:34.930> games<00:05:35.229> or<00:05:35.560> do<00:05:36.460> a<00:05:36.520> live<00:05:36.789> Q&amp;A

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:37.150 
play some mini games or do a live Q&amp;A

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.240 
play some mini games or do a live Q&amp;A
like<00:05:37.539> in-game<00:05:38.080> not<00:05:38.379> on<00:05:38.469> the<00:05:38.560> forms<00:05:38.889> for<00:05:39.069> once

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
like in-game not on the forms for once

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.339 
like in-game not on the forms for once
like<00:05:39.520> something<00:05:39.969> that<00:05:40.240> would<00:05:40.750> be<00:05:40.839> interesting

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:41.349 
like something that would be interesting

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:42.990 
like something that would be interesting
for<00:05:41.469> everyone<00:05:41.710> and<00:05:42.159> everyone<00:05:42.639> would<00:05:42.849> get

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 
for everyone and everyone would get

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.219 
for everyone and everyone would get
something<00:05:43.180> out<00:05:43.449> of<00:05:43.479> it<00:05:43.659> so<00:05:43.899> it'd<00:05:44.020> be<00:05:44.050> a<00:05:44.169> little

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:44.229 
something out of it so it'd be a little

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.350 
something out of it so it'd be a little
more<00:05:44.349> entertaining<00:05:44.860> one<00:05:45.759> of<00:05:45.879> the<00:05:46.000> things<00:05:46.210> that

just<00:07:08.229> I<00:07:08.530> don't<00:07:08.650> really<00:07:08.800> understand<00:07:09.340> what<00:07:09.729> is

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:09.940 
just I don't really understand what is

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.790 
just I don't really understand what is
going<00:07:10.240> on<00:07:10.509> anymore<00:07:10.750> with<00:07:11.050> jeggings<00:07:11.440> I<00:07:11.530> think

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:11.800 
going on anymore with jeggings I think

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:13.320 
going on anymore with jeggings I think
that<00:07:11.919> they<00:07:12.039> just<00:07:12.069> they<00:07:12.729> don't<00:07:12.880> really<00:07:13.030> care

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:13.330 
that they just they don't really care

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:15.689 
that they just they don't really care
what<00:07:13.509> anyone<00:07:13.990> does<00:07:14.199> they<00:07:14.560> just<00:07:14.800> pretend<00:07:15.669> that

00:07:15.689 --> 00:07:15.699 
what anyone does they just pretend that

00:07:15.699 --> 00:07:17.490 
what anyone does they just pretend that
they<00:07:15.849> do<00:07:15.910> so<00:07:16.270> that<00:07:16.389> people<00:07:16.660> will<00:07:16.960> continue<00:07:17.380> to

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:17.500 
they do so that people will continue to

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.150 
they do so that people will continue to
play<00:07:17.740> it<00:07:18.669> makes<00:07:18.849> no<00:07:19.000> sense<00:07:19.030> to<00:07:19.389> me<00:07:19.479> I

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:20.160 
play it makes no sense to me I

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:22.230 
play it makes no sense to me I
personally<00:07:21.160> I<00:07:21.220> think<00:07:21.310> this<00:07:21.580> entire<00:07:21.699> thing<00:07:22.120> is

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 
personally I think this entire thing is

00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.379 
personally I think this entire thing is
just<00:07:22.270> a<00:07:22.479> ploy<00:07:22.720> to<00:07:22.750> like<00:07:23.789> well<00:07:24.789> I<00:07:24.970> already<00:07:25.210> said

00:07:25.379 --> 00:07:25.389 
just a ploy to like well I already said

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:26.820 
just a ploy to like well I already said
it<00:07:25.509> basically<00:07:25.900> just<00:07:25.990> keep<00:07:26.320> people<00:07:26.590> playing

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:26.830 
it basically just keep people playing

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:28.830 
it basically just keep people playing
but<00:07:27.280> make<00:07:27.490> it<00:07:27.520> look<00:07:27.639> like<00:07:27.820> they<00:07:27.940> still<00:07:28.180> care

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:28.840 
but make it look like they still care

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.779 
but make it look like they still care
about<00:07:28.870> anything<00:07:29.410> but<00:07:30.009> that's<00:07:30.160> all<00:07:30.280> I<00:07:30.310> really

00:07:30.779 --> 00:07:30.789 
about anything but that's all I really
