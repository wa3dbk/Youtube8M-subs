00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:26.099 
really thinking with all this right even

00:07:26.099 --> 00:07:29.749 
really thinking with all this right even
this<00:07:26.939> weird-lookin<00:07:27.569> can<00:07:27.839> I<00:07:28.550> was<00:07:29.550> really

00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 
this weird-lookin can I was really

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:30.919

thinking<00:07:29.879> that<00:07:30.119> this<00:07:30.209> is<00:07:30.360> going<00:07:30.539> to<00:07:30.599> be<00:07:30.719> just

00:07:30.919 --> 00:07:30.929 
thinking that this is going to be just

00:07:30.929 --> 00:07:35.659 
thinking that this is going to be just
awful<00:07:31.229> and<00:07:32.360> it's<00:07:33.360> not<00:07:34.219> so<00:07:35.219> if<00:07:35.459> you're<00:07:35.579> up

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:35.669 
awful and it's not so if you're up

00:07:35.669 --> 00:07:37.159 
awful and it's not so if you're up
against<00:07:35.939> the<00:07:36.089> wall<00:07:36.269> and<00:07:36.539> then<00:07:36.839> you<00:07:36.899> want<00:07:37.079> to

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:37.169 
against the wall and then you want to

00:07:37.169 --> 00:07:39.229 
against the wall and then you want to
