00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:15.209
 and how she made her way with a hard hand 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.579
 This is of course a reason to celebrate is likely in 2011 

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.480
 Among them were numerous birthday shows in China 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.330
 celebrities like it could not resist the enormously successful

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.940
 and quite a lot of fun 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.089
 all the more, the hit is denied 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.089

 would do it 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.170
 and Nash Hamburger's audience has always been fantastically supportive 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.960
 I remember that first appearance from England in the 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.960
 Erzinger memories awake so Jens Marquardt

 while argue is the wallet and the city has so long been one 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.590
