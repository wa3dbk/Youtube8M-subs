that<00:02:06.810> it<00:02:07.140> hit<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.350> wall<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.590> mean<00:02:07.979> it's<00:02:08.129> just

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
that it hit the wall I mean it's just

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.410 
that it hit the wall I mean it's just
handles<00:02:09.780> great<00:02:10.550> practice<00:02:11.550> all<00:02:11.730> orientation

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
handles great practice all orientation

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.590 
handles great practice all orientation
of<00:02:12.540> flight<00:02:12.810> and<00:02:13.050> just

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
of flight and just

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.530

911<00:02:39.940> it's<00:02:40.210> got<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.360> pretty<00:02:40.600> cool<00:02:40.720> canopy<00:02:41.200> it's

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
911 it's got a pretty cool canopy it's

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:45.810 
911 it's got a pretty cool canopy it's
reminiscent<00:02:42.040> of<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:43.500> p40<00:02:44.550> airplanes<00:02:45.550> with

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
reminiscent of the p40 airplanes with

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.450 
reminiscent of the p40 airplanes with
the<00:02:46.000> shark<00:02:46.480> head<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:47.650> looks<00:02:47.770> really<00:02:48.010> cool<00:02:48.190> I

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
the shark head it looks really cool I

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:50.850 
the shark head it looks really cool I
like<00:02:49.210> how<00:02:49.360> it<00:02:49.510> looks

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
like how it looks

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.220 
like how it looks
the<00:02:51.070> bright<00:02:51.280> colors<00:02:51.310> allows<00:02:51.970> you<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.300> see<00:02:52.570> the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
the bright colors allows you to see the

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.400 
the bright colors allows you to see the
nose<00:02:53.560> when<00:02:54.040> it<00:02:54.160> starts<00:02:54.400> getting<00:02:54.490> far<00:02:54.850> away<00:02:54.880> and

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
nose when it starts getting far away and

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.750 
nose when it starts getting far away and
overall<00:02:56.410> it's<00:02:56.770> just<00:02:56.830> got<00:02:57.070> a<00:02:57.100> really<00:02:57.340> light

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
overall it's just got a really light

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.630 
overall it's just got a really light
weight<00:02:58.090> it's<00:02:58.510> not<00:02:58.600> aluminum<00:02:59.320> constructed<00:02:59.980> but

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
weight it's not aluminum constructed but

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.280 
weight it's not aluminum constructed but
it<00:03:00.760> kind<00:03:00.970> of<00:03:01.030> benefits<00:03:01.570> it<00:03:01.750> because<00:03:02.080> of<00:03:02.200> the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
it kind of benefits it because of the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
it kind of benefits it because of the
plastic<00:03:02.740> construction

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
plastic construction

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.180 
plastic construction
it<00:03:03.850> keeps<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.360> late<00:03:04.570> the<00:03:05.290> weight<00:03:05.500> real<00:03:05.890> low

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
it keeps the late the weight real low

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.370 
it keeps the late the weight real low
especially<00:03:06.820> with<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.030> carbon<00:03:07.390> boom<00:03:07.600> and<00:03:07.840> that

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
especially with the carbon boom and that

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.640 
especially with the carbon boom and that
translates<00:03:08.920> into<00:03:09.190> more<00:03:09.670> flight<00:03:09.910> time<00:03:10.650> so

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
translates into more flight time so

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.200 
translates into more flight time so
another<00:03:11.860> really<00:03:12.130> cool<00:03:12.280> feature<00:03:12.340> about<00:03:12.760> this

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
another really cool feature about this

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.560 
another really cool feature about this
2.4<00:03:13.810> gigahertz<00:03:13.930> transmitter<00:03:14.230> system<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:15.040> that

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
2.4 gigahertz transmitter system is that

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.010 
2.4 gigahertz transmitter system is that
you<00:03:16.570> can<00:03:16.720> change<00:03:16.990> from<00:03:17.290> mode<00:03:17.560> 1<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:18.190> mode<00:03:18.430> 2

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
you can change from mode 1 to mode 2

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.570 
you can change from mode 1 to mode 2
that's<00:03:20.020> not<00:03:20.320> changing<00:03:20.590> the<00:03:20.860> joysticks<00:03:21.370> it's

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
that's not changing the joysticks it's

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.830 
that's not changing the joysticks it's
actually<00:03:21.850> changing<00:03:22.210> the<00:03:22.300> rates<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.720> the

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
actually changing the rates of the

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:26.140 
sticks if you're at mode 1 your swash

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.930 
sticks if you're at mode 1 your swash
plates<00:03:26.410> respond<00:03:26.860> a<00:03:26.950> lot<00:03:27.070> slower<00:03:27.370> it<00:03:27.640> gives<00:03:27.790> you

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
plates respond a lot slower it gives you

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.910 
plates respond a lot slower it gives you
time<00:03:28.420> to<00:03:28.600> react<00:03:28.900> once<00:03:29.350> you<00:03:29.440> get<00:03:29.590> comfortable
