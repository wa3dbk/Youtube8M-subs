many reasons basically we had it he'll
set<00:00:21.619> up<00:00:21.680> on<00:00:21.830> oh<00:00:21.950> my<00:00:22.460> I<00:00:22.810> am<00:00:23.810> long<00:00:23.960> fall<00:00:24.169> boots<00:00:24.200> I

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
set up on oh my I am long fall boots I

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:26.260 
set up on oh my I am long fall boots I
was<00:00:24.590> baffled<00:00:25.160> why<00:00:25.490> I<00:00:25.520> didn't<00:00:25.699> dare<00:00:25.850> then<00:00:26.029> that

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:26.270 
was baffled why I didn't dare then that

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.179 
was baffled why I didn't dare then that
was<00:00:26.390> not<00:00:26.660> purpose<00:00:27.080> or<00:00:27.199> sorry<00:00:27.439> about<00:00:27.619> that<00:00:27.650> but

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:28.189 
was not purpose or sorry about that but

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:29.259 
was not purpose or sorry about that but
basically<00:00:28.310> it's<00:00:28.699> been<00:00:28.820> a<00:00:28.850> while<00:00:29.000> since<00:00:29.150> I've

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
basically it's been a while since I've

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.920 
basically it's been a while since I've
done<00:00:29.300> anything<00:00:30.289> unblock<00:00:30.769> it<00:00:30.800> and<00:00:31.130> there's

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
done anything unblock it and there's

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.330 
done anything unblock it and there's
many<00:00:32.930> many<00:00:33.110> many<00:00:33.320> reasons<00:00:33.590> for<00:00:33.830> that<00:00:34.010> as<00:00:34.160> I<00:00:34.220> was

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
many many many reasons for that as I was

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.830 
many many many reasons for that as I was
saying<00:00:34.519> but<00:00:34.670> basically<00:00:35.030> we<00:00:35.330> had<00:00:35.480> a<00:00:35.510> horse<00:00:35.720> in

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
saying but basically we had a horse in

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.710 
saying but basically we had a horse in
on<00:00:35.930> a<00:00:35.960> server<00:00:36.260> and<00:00:36.890> then<00:00:37.190> the<00:00:37.940> server<00:00:38.120> deserted

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
on a server and then the server deserted

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.619 
on a server and then the server deserted
best<00:00:38.930> of<00:00:39.050> this<00:00:39.850> seemingly<00:00:40.850> no<00:00:41.000> exist<00:00:41.390> anymore

00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:41.629 
best of this seemingly no exist anymore

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:43.950 
best of this seemingly no exist anymore
I<00:00:41.780> can't<00:00:42.110> quite<00:00:42.500> explain<00:00:42.620> it<00:00:43.129> but<00:00:43.190> basically

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
I can't quite explain it but basically

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.840 
I can't quite explain it but basically
or<00:00:44.960> is<00:00:45.110> it<00:00:45.350> simply<00:00:45.860> needs<00:00:46.070> a<00:00:46.190> port<00:00:46.489> to<00:00:46.640> get<00:00:46.760> over

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
or is it simply needs a port to get over

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:55.090 
or is it simply needs a port to get over
here<00:00:47.089> mmm<00:00:49.089> good<00:00:50.089> and<00:00:52.900> yes<00:00:53.900> good<00:00:54.530> good<00:00:54.890> good

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.490 
here mmm good and yes good good good
good<00:00:55.510> but<00:00:56.510> anyway<00:00:56.720> basically<00:00:56.930> yeah<00:00:57.260> the<00:00:57.350> whole

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500
