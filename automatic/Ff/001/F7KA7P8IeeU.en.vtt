00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.170
 to be able to do this we must do 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:23.860
 next we would go to settings 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.400
 after adjustments we should go to 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.400
 general 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.529
 in general 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.900
 we would have the keyboard options 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:42.890
 we would move and move until we leave 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.890
 to keyboard 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.730
 we would have to install a keyboard 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.730
 again this keyboard would be a keyboard 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.730
 called 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:01.000
 we have gene well let's look there what 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.000
 we have in mojo 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.850
 once we have selected it already 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.030
 we would have the two keyboards activated 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.490
 this keyboard would be the emoticons 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.320
 we could go back and open 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.090
 any application in this case we're going 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:18.000
 to try the application 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.690
 what's up and we will try to send a 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.620
 emoticono by whatsapp 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:26.620
 well we selected whatsapp 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:35.370
 we click on him 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.180
 now we would choose any the chat and 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.180
 any user 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:45.360
 and if we find out, we can see how 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.860
 when we click we have that option is a balloon 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.620
 earth is the earth globe what 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.530
 will show us emoticons, well, since 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:55.440
 we could type the emoticons there 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.890
 we have to move and we choose 

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:01.470
 the emoticon we want well 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.630
 we can press any and then already 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.850
 send in that simple way 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.630
 we would have our iphone with the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.630
 emoticons
