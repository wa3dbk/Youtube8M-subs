00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
playing multiplayer and I did something

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.549 
playing multiplayer and I did something
and<00:00:38.370> then<00:00:38.550> I<00:00:38.820> flew<00:00:39.329> into<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.570> map<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.079> tried<00:00:40.410> it

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
and then I flew into the map I tried it

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.110 
and then I flew into the map I tried it
one<00:00:40.739> more<00:00:40.860> time<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.129> couldn't<00:00:41.670> get<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.910> try<00:00:42.090> it

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
one more time I couldn't get it try it

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.869 
one more time I couldn't get it try it
another<00:00:42.329> time<00:00:42.480> I<00:00:42.629> got<00:00:42.960> it<00:00:43.140> but<00:00:43.710> it's<00:00:44.309> very<00:00:44.550> hard

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
another time I got it but it's very hard

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.610 
another time I got it but it's very hard
to<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.120> but<00:00:45.480> I'm<00:00:45.690> going<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.050> working<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.440> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
to do but I'm going to be working on it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.209 
to do but I'm going to be working on it
so<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:47.879> think<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.239> very<00:00:48.360> hot<00:00:49.230> it's

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
so and I think this is very hot it's

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:51.350 
so and I think this is very hot it's
very<00:00:50.399> good<00:00:50.520> too<00:00:50.820> because<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.210> actually

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
very good too because you actually

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.600 
very good too because you actually
survive<00:00:51.930> under<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.800> map<00:00:53.010> which<00:00:53.219> i<00:00:53.370> think<00:00:53.430> is

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
survive under the map which i think is

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.100 
survive under the map which i think is
very<00:00:53.699> sweet<00:00:54.059> because<00:00:54.300> most<00:00:54.570> multiplayer

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
very sweet because most multiplayer

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.930 
very sweet because most multiplayer
games<00:00:55.379> as<00:00:55.949> soon<00:00:56.160> as<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.340> get<00:00:56.460> out<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.760> map

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
games as soon as you get out of the map

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
of or under the map you do die so I

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.980 
of or under the map you do die so I
found<00:01:20.329> this<00:01:20.539> I<00:01:20.750> found<00:01:21.200> this<00:01:21.530> very<00:01:22.990> intriguing

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
found this I found this very intriguing

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.130 
found this I found this very intriguing
very<00:01:24.759> unique<00:01:25.759> that<00:01:26.119> the<00:01:26.360> fact<00:01:26.600> that<00:01:26.689> I<00:01:26.810> could

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:27.140 
very unique that the fact that I could

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.630 
very unique that the fact that I could
still<00:01:27.439> survive<00:01:27.590> under<00:01:27.920> the<00:01:28.039> map<00:01:28.220> and<00:01:28.399> I<00:01:28.460> think

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
still survive under the map and I think

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.160 
still survive under the map and I think
it<00:01:28.700> was<00:01:28.789> very<00:01:28.970> sick<00:01:29.210> and<00:01:29.240> it's<00:01:29.509> very<00:01:29.720> visual

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
it was very sick and it's very visual

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.669 
it was very sick and it's very visual
and<00:01:30.640> all<00:01:31.640> that<00:01:31.880> but<00:01:32.060> this<00:01:32.899> is<00:01:33.049> a<00:01:33.079> flawless<00:01:33.500> game

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
and all that but this is a flawless game

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:36.669 
and all that but this is a flawless game
so<00:01:33.979> me<00:01:34.280> finding<00:01:34.640> this<00:01:34.789> was<00:01:35.030> really<00:01:35.240> nice<00:01:36.229> and<00:01:36.259> I
