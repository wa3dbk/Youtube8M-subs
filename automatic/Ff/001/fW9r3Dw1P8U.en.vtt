00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
use the tips use these bits it's what I

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.270 
use the tips use these bits it's what I
do<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.399> just<00:01:20.940> kind<00:01:21.149> of<00:01:21.440> work<00:01:22.440> my<00:01:22.679> way<00:01:22.830> outwards

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
do I just kind of work my way outwards

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:40.710 
do I just kind of work my way outwards
in<00:01:23.550> little<00:01:24.210> semi<00:01:24.780> circles<00:01:26.509> it<00:01:27.509> was<00:01:27.630> bleed

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.720 

and<00:01:41.230> already<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:41.770> can<00:01:41.800> see<00:01:41.950> a<00:01:42.100> difference<00:01:43.530> OOP

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:44.730 
and already you can see a difference OOP

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:51.580 
and already you can see a difference OOP
just<00:01:45.730> waking<00:01:46.060> you<00:01:46.120> I<00:01:46.180> outlets

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.649 

I<00:01:51.649> use<00:01:52.429> this<00:01:52.579> technique<00:01:52.939> when<00:01:53.119> I'm<00:01:53.240> in<00:01:53.390> more<00:01:53.630> of

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
I use this technique when I'm in more of

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.590 
I use this technique when I'm in more of
a<00:01:53.780> hurry<00:01:53.810> and<00:01:54.289> or<00:01:55.039> I'm<00:01:55.700> traveling<00:01:56.240> I<00:01:56.270> don't

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
a hurry and or I'm traveling I don't

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.490 
a hurry and or I'm traveling I don't
have<00:01:56.689> all<00:01:56.780> my<00:01:56.810> brushes<00:01:57.079> with<00:01:57.409> me<00:01:59.380> because<00:02:00.380> I

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
have all my brushes with me because I

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:09.180 
have all my brushes with me because I
drove<00:02:00.710> up<00:02:00.799> between<00:02:01.039> houses<00:02:01.280> quite<00:02:01.700> a<00:02:01.729> lot

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.890 

so<00:02:10.190> this<00:02:10.310> is<00:02:10.429> good<00:02:10.580> for<00:02:10.729> the<00:02:10.759> Guinness<00:02:11.090> if<00:02:11.420> you

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
so this is good for the Guinness if you

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.890 
so this is good for the Guinness if you
have<00:02:12.080> it<00:02:12.200> really<00:02:12.410> um<00:02:13.030> got<00:02:14.030> any<00:02:14.209> brushes<00:02:14.540> or
