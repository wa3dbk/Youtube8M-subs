easiest instruments to learn how to play
now<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.390> harmonica<00:00:34.050> has<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> few<00:00:34.980> simple<00:00:35.219> rules

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
now the harmonica has a few simple rules

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.030 
now the harmonica has a few simple rules
number<00:00:36.300> one<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:37.380> breathe

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
number one just breathe

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.580 
number one just breathe
that's<00:00:38.550> it<00:00:38.730> just<00:00:39.300> by<00:00:39.480> blowing<00:00:39.989> out<00:00:40.320> and

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
that's it just by blowing out and

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.549 
that's it just by blowing out and
inhaling<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:43.820> you<00:00:44.820> can<00:00:44.969> make<00:00:45.149> sound<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:46.020> that

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
inhaling it you can make sound and that

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.130 
inhaling it you can make sound and that
sound<00:00:46.620> isn't<00:00:47.100> half<00:00:47.370> bad<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:48.390> harmonica<00:00:48.989> is

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
sound isn't half bad the harmonica is

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.069 
sound isn't half bad the harmonica is
easy<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.530> play<00:00:49.680> because<00:00:50.520> each<00:00:50.820> harmonica<00:00:51.629> if

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
easy to play because each harmonica if

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.290 
easy to play because each harmonica if
it's<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.530> regular<00:00:52.980> 10<00:00:53.250> hole<00:00:53.460> diatonic<00:00:54.120> like

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
it's a regular 10 hole diatonic like

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:54.979 
it's a regular 10 hole diatonic like
this<00:00:54.510> one

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
this one

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.099 
this one
each<00:00:55.559> one<00:00:55.949> is<00:00:56.190> tuned<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.730> different<00:00:57.120> key<00:00:57.270> so

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
each one is tuned to a different key so

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.760 
each one is tuned to a different key so
there<00:00:58.500> are<00:00:58.680> twelve<00:00:59.100> normal<00:00:59.940> keys<00:01:00.180> of

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
there are twelve normal keys of

of notes and structures that you have to

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.020 
of notes and structures that you have to
learn<00:01:55.810> with<00:01:56.440> harmonica<00:01:57.160> you<00:01:57.640> only<00:01:57.790> do<00:01:58.000> that

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
learn with harmonica you only do that

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.180 
learn with harmonica you only do that
once<00:01:58.450> with<00:01:58.930> a<00:01:58.990> piano<00:01:59.350> or<00:01:59.500> guitar<00:01:59.620> you<00:01:59.980> better

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
once with a piano or guitar you better

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.430 
once with a piano or guitar you better
learn<00:02:00.340> about<00:02:00.550> twelve<00:02:00.880> or<00:02:01.240> even<00:02:01.990> more<00:02:02.170> times

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
learn about twelve or even more times

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.560 
learn about twelve or even more times
than<00:02:02.800> you<00:02:03.100> could<00:02:03.550> possibly<00:02:03.580> even<00:02:04.060> imagine

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
than you could possibly even imagine

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.240 
than you could possibly even imagine
with<00:02:05.050> all<00:02:05.080> the<00:02:05.350> different<00:02:05.680> majors<00:02:05.800> or<00:02:06.220> minors

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
with all the different majors or minors

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.580 
with all the different majors or minors
that<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:06.850> can<00:02:07.000> have<00:02:07.180> so<00:02:07.780> the<00:02:07.900> harmonica<00:02:08.470> is

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
that you can have so the harmonica is

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.640 
that you can have so the harmonica is
easy<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:09.220> play<00:02:09.369> it's<00:02:10.149> also<00:02:10.420> one<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.380> very

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
easy to play it's also one of the very

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.670 
easy to play it's also one of the very
few<00:02:11.980> it's<00:02:12.640> the<00:02:12.760> only<00:02:13.270> instrument<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:14.410> you

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
few it's the only instrument that you

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.560 
few it's the only instrument that you
can<00:02:14.830> play<00:02:15.040> without<00:02:15.430> actually<00:02:15.970> looking<00:02:16.300> at<00:02:16.480> it

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:16.570 
can play without actually looking at it

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.420 
can play without actually looking at it
that's<00:02:16.990> right<00:02:17.290> I<00:02:19.110> see<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.140> little<00:02:20.320> bit<00:02:20.530> of<00:02:20.650> mine

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
that's right I see a little bit of mine

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.790 
that's right I see a little bit of mine
but<00:02:21.910> other<00:02:22.240> than<00:02:22.330> that<00:02:22.420> I'm<00:02:22.990> playing<00:02:23.320> by<00:02:23.530> few

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
but other than that I'm playing by few

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.920 
but other than that I'm playing by few
after<00:02:24.670> a<00:02:24.700> while<00:02:25.030> a<00:02:25.060> little<00:02:25.360> bit<00:02:25.630> of<00:02:25.720> playing

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
after a while a little bit of playing

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.660 
after a while a little bit of playing
the<00:02:26.110> harmonica<00:02:26.650> you're<00:02:27.040> gonna<00:02:27.160> know<00:02:27.459> where

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
the harmonica you're gonna know where

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.170 
the harmonica you're gonna know where
every<00:02:28.030> single<00:02:28.390> hole<00:02:28.570> is<00:02:28.780> just<00:02:29.020> by<00:02:32.880> playing<00:02:33.880> uh

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
every single hole is just by playing uh

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.070 
every single hole is just by playing uh
with<00:02:34.989> practice<00:02:35.580> so<00:02:36.580> it's<00:02:37.300> easier<00:02:37.660> practiced

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
with practice so it's easier practiced

with practice so it's easier practiced
on<00:02:38.200> harmonica<00:02:38.680> because<00:02:39.310> unlike<00:02:39.580> other

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
on harmonica because unlike other
