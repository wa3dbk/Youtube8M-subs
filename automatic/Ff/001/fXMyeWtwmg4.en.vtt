00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:12.780
 good staff this here is my honda civic 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:15.690
 lx year 1999 was looking here in my 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.960
 backup on the computer I have much more 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.660
 photos of what video is from my cars and 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.960
 the changes I have made right in 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.820
 During the ii of the year but a 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.519
 A lot of people have been around this time. 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.070
 posting a video such and there I found out 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.590
 that I was not the only one crazy in this 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.329
 history was not the only one passionate about 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.309
 cars 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.500
 So where are some times I'm here? 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.390
 making some videos until it's retro 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:50.760
 trying to explain what I've already done 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:56.160
 I've never been before, so I guess 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:00.000
 that if I think every car is an account 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.730
 part of my life so that your 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.820
 join all of them I can be 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:07.170
 My whole life story, right? 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.350
 so when the homesickness of some of the 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:14.640
 stretches just enter one of these 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.790
 cause the accelerator to smell the 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.799
 car brings me there 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.979
 It makes me go back in time. 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:26.880
 I do not know if any of you have ever had 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:31.229
 this feeling is but maybe that's why 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.450
 that I can not get rid of the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:38.180
 cars that I'm getting right now because 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.430
 they end up being part of my life 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:46.290
 I identify myself a lot with each one. 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.460
 them and that I vibrate every change that I 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.579
 I do 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:55.229
 In this case Tim is starting here by 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.079
 front grille 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.970
 she was black was originally painted 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.680
 in the color of the car 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:07.620
 and in the case of the bumper half of it is of 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.710
 fiber being that he received a beacon of 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.360
 mile of the generation 3 goal and a grid of 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:22.230
 I breathed that I thought it was over 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:26.730
 invoked in the side of color borrachÃµes 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.040
 car and these headlights here I just 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.860
 bringing germany 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.740
 I already had a little scorch dinho 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.080
 This is what I ended up buying from Germany. 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:39.690
 because in Germany still the same system 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:43.260
 from Brazil that has a flashlight 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:45.030
 light bulb drip and the independent arrow 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.670
 if I even bought it will make in the states 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:53.430
 attached to flashlight to be integrated with arrow 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:56.730
 but I like the right integrated antenna 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.459
 That's why I ended up bringing Germany and 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.780
 I made the electrical connection that calls 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.280
 ninja bond, right? 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.769
 I'll call the lantern when I call. 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.830
 the arrow and the time to make sure it is 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.320
 stronger and I got this 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.780
 model of a lighthouse because one day I 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.680
 want to get rid of those of the car comes from 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.180
 this I can easily go back to 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.040
 Brazilian configuration 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.500
 so much is that the pim also give installed 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:29.030
 here as I said 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:33.660
 the side friezes are the color of the car 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:36.420
 here at the back writing the honda civic 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:40.470
 lx left outside 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.750
 I left only the emblem of the round and the plaque 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.110
 that little plaid personalized 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:55.080
 which I think ended up letting her bring 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:56.750
 more but it's a more imposing rear 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.220
 huh 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.780
 in the case of exhaust and an exhaust 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:09.599
 rsi has all steel exhaust 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:12.240
 stainless steel and it has an option he has a 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:13.500
 option to decrease the diameter of 4 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.060
 inches 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:20.760
 homes and socks for long trips 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.740
 we can reduce the amount of 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.740
 noise, right? 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:35.940
 as well as the back plate a small plate 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:38.970
 the front is also custom that 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.400
 also leaves the front quite aggressive 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:46.160
 I think it was quite in harmony with 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:50.030
 the watches also with the wheel nÃ© 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:50.030
 the wheels rim 18 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.490
 so this is personal outside 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.180
 these are the changes that 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.100
 has received 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.610
 I think the design of this car 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.610
 wonderful 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:21.380
 I believe that many do not need 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:24.840
 changes but the little game 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.490
 flashlight here in case here this flashlight 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.540
 I brought from the United States is a 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.890
 flashlight 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.960
 that redd model wants to get that 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:37.080
 I think that white in the place of 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.970
 arrow ends up leaving him resembles a 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:42.090
 bit of the judgment and leave a little 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:46.890
 more invoked being that the lanterns 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:49.410
 I have saved this document too. 

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:53.210
 it was one more change I made 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:59.430
 placing these flashlights to acquire is 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:06:00.419
 sales of the United States is also this 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:04.669
 I hope that you guys have 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.669
 liked the video a hug there
