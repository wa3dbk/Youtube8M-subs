00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.699
 the well-known andrew series involves today 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.710
 andrea corte the astro carlo savinelli 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.960
 during day 1 of the double pt national 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.369
 a digital game standard one 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.140
 extremely interesting hand also 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.669
 because two are both very self 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.349
 the action is very particular 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:33.239
 let's find out analysis together 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.580
 hand and obviously the tics in protests i 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.610
 two protagonists before that hand 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:41.489
 we have already challenged ourselves in 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.690
 another two or three carlo spots I know is a 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.640
 very aggressive player 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.670
 respect for the victory he had 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.119
 has always flirted both flop turn and 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.869
 river I hadn't already caught a couple of 

00:00:51.119 --> 00:00:54.690
 times 

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:56.640
 we hope in the hand in question the cut 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.220
 off a fairly aggressive player 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.170
 with a fairly short detachment a 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.339
 I presumed to lean with ace 9 a 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:08.130
 spades carlos quiza ring because the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:10.460
 mister opens the range of 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.310
 little boy's goal 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.750
 I think it's a weak police I don't think 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.340
 what kind did he yield to such hands 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.710
 ace woman who maybe can play 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.720
 well or call tribetta then 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.630
 decided to pay the original passes 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.540
 the boy's hot raiser is a move that 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.840
 had already done and I choose to look at 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.080
 flop 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:34.399
 now she hears a woman with two carlo flowers 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.590
 naturally 10,000 owl I choose to 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.540
 call enough to evaluate what it does 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.800
 late at this point I believe his 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:44.229
 land be it 9 ace ten cappadonna 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.420
 tar puts a jack 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:50.420
 sometimes it can also have ace jack 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:53.330
 is decided to throw in and I am in the decided of 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.310
 do 28 thousand and give up some will come 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.289
 instead then decided to make a size for 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.979
 let me kind a protes will come 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.479
 to decide to do 21 and so much silvio 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.039
 ace jack that should be maybe 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:05.149
 the only hand that could really 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.869
 call call 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:12.560
 I think it turns out I'm a little surprised 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:16.370
 sais que fakes 21,000 go to call 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.110
 another way and assess river him 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.329
 play one I'm pretty sure I have 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.250
 type ace ten it 9 or cappadonna 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.950
 sometimes some combo of flowers but 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.470
 I tell the truth I am very much 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.410
 confidant who had cappadona up 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.540
 I have ten in his name or some ace 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.700
 on idea of ​​the oba of the genus rivera 18 of 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:39.940
 flowers that in my opinion benefit feathers 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:45.140
 that he sends me the direct tub there 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:49.400
 tired endless because in my opinion not 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:51.920
 never color I think in the end mine 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.420
 action was a little too aggressive 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.520
 however, in the end, I think that 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.920
 I would sincerely do again because really 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.040
 super strong nation if I want to 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:03.950
 I stayed with 50 thousand and mine 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.110
 my feeling was that it was empty if 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.600
 would have done it full I would have gone out with 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.959
 honor however took courage 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.360
 pronounced colmi turns 82 I vented with 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:16.670
 a punch on the table anyway I have 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.320
 done I believe his action instead 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.580
 almost all the streets were wrong but 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.850
 not because he won the pot because 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:25.700
 But I think it's kind of a bad flate 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.830
 3500 jack cut off ie hijack button 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.530
 promised new suites and excluded bla bla 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.480
 indexes to replay on the flop to play 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.950
 al tar but decides to play will come to 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.080
 this point if you really want to go out 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.519
 redo no need to talk six 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.200
 minutes help that the call must be a 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.819
 a bit faster if it was the hand like that 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.799
 hand from the end 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.799
 It went well for him and I lost
