 hello everyone who is welcome one day 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.790
 more to the channel today I bring you a new 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:13.070
 makeup in this case a makeup 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.540
 for night we go every new use 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.920
 for when I want but I think it's 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.349
 perfect for summer nights 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.240
 in addition there are several lip options as well 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:22.039
 If you 're interested, let's start 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.500
 first place like I'm going to use a pain 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.210
 pot is the soft ocher other that I am 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.800
 drying a little bit and that's why I want 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.800
 give it use 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.960
 with a little product as you can see 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.460
 I'm extending all the eyelid all 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.590
 the makeup even made with the 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.440
 shades of the palette of naked 2 that is 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.570
 one of my favorites 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.760
 and Well first let's take the 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.760
 gray shadow of the palette 

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:52.060
 and we're going to put it all over the eyelid 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.450
 without any mystery we will go 

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:57.310
 spreading and with the shadows matte on the 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.960
 tone tease I will go leaving the names 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.430
 down here what are we going to go 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.710
 making choose blurring the e 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:06.449
 integrating it and let's help us too 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.449
 of a basic brush to blur 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.409
 then we are going to take a 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:27.679
 more precise brush and what we are going to 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.710
 catch is the shadow snake bites that is a 

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:32.960
 brown not very dark either but let's 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.630
 go marking what is the corner 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.399
 outside and a little bit the basin 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.959
 we are going to integrate it and then we 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:41.209
 let's also help from the shadow 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:42.829
 blackout that is the black matte of the 

00:01:41.209 --> 00:01:45.079
 same palette you see that a makeup 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:47.929
 very simple is simply to darken the 

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.909
 The end of the eye is a very 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:51.649
 basic and good we will help from the 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.770
 same shadow shade shadow tease 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.380
 to blur and with the foxy shadow 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.799
 we will illuminate what is the arch of the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.799
 eyebrows 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.119
 from now do the outlined 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.590
 Maybe the makeup does not look like 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.030
 exactly exactly the same because 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.459
 I had a small problem and I had to 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.019
 re-perform and good a delineated 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.879
 I say I did not get it because 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.040
 soon as soon as you can I will make a 

00:02:12.879 --> 00:02:17.019
 specific video but let's go a delineated 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.940
 very simple , you see with a bit of 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:22.569
 Now let's take the face now 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:25.720
 finite of max factor and the the illuminator 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:27.370
 soap liquid let's spread it with 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.549
 your hands are going to let it settle 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.629
 little and with the corrector hd yellow of nik 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:37.340
 let's put a little in the dark circles 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.260
 camouflage them a bit and also provide a 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:43.150
 little bit of light you can see I'm going to go 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.150
 spreading with a flat brush 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:52.010
 Well now let's take the powder 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.650
 loose of pierre n 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:57.319
 and we are going to fix all the makeup 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:01.239
 dark circles and let's seal a little 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.239
 which is the whole basis of the whole face 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:10.350
 let's take the powder from the collection 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.600
 mercadona ladies who already have several 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.400
 years and what we're going to do is tan 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.850
 a little but with few products are 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.430
 some metallic satin powder but 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:22.140
 that bring enough tone or bronze to 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.360
 vito let's go uploading it because this 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.100
 it's not going to be an outline as such 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.890
 simply because it's a little bit of 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.840
 Sun tanning 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:31.550
 and now let's take the castle that 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.130
 I'm super happy that I won it in 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.410
 draw it and we will take the color 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.720
 this nash organ 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:40.400
 we are going to apply it as it always is 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.650
 button is great that is me 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.140
 charming it is normal to have so much 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.090
 fame and good the rouge this blusher 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:49.130
 the truth that seems very basic to me 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.440
 everything looks great let's take the 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.209
 illuminator sofÃ¡n gentle and good this is 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.120
 one of the most important steps I 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.920
 It seems great to abuse a tad 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.080
 to see us without looking like light bulbs 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.150
 abusing a tad of the illuminator is in 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.770
 summer is good and good where always now 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.810
 I'm going to give several lip options that 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.030
 I think you can see how combining this 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.420
 makeup with almost everything we are going to 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.980
 first take this newt point that the 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.730
 truth is that I find it super basic and 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.730
 super nice 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.440
 then we are going to take one of the 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.660
 of wet and wild these lipsticks 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.169
 I recommend a lot and well it is a 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:34.150
 red with a strawberry point would say I 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.819
 and well, the truth is that 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:40.210
 favors a lot I at least it seems 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:42.160
 It looks very nice 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:44.550
 you will tell me below that the way 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.550
 like more 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.319
 let's now take a much more tone 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.909
 summery and much more fluorine that I have 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.860
 almost always kept in the drawer until 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:00.560
 that the good weather is coming and it is the living 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.889
 glam nikisch one of mack in one tone 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:06.379
 quite special and that I think many 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:08.889
 Sometimes it costs to see him but as you see 

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:12.100
 It is very very striking 

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:14.200
 and it can be very cool 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.910
 like makeup in neutral tones I think 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.330
 that any lipstick can sit on 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.330
 all right 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:23.039
 here you have how it is for that I have 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:25.789
 wanted to make a very wearable makeup 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:25.789
 For any occasion 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.470
 and then finally he's going to take an orange 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:33.170
 that is very, very fashionable 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.510
 it's an orange orange looking is not the tan 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:37.190
 green screen of sleep and the truth is that 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:41.410
 It's hard to see me favored with him but 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.410
 the color is a pass that you think 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.320
 and well, until here has arrived the 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.220
 video I hope you liked us 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.220
 we see in the next
