define the rest of the face here which

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.990 
define the rest of the face here which
is<00:01:52.940> fine<00:01:53.240> I<00:01:54.190> mean<00:01:55.190> we<00:01:55.430> can<00:01:55.580> always<00:01:55.700> do<00:01:55.970> that

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
is fine I mean we can always do that

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.850 
is fine I mean we can always do that
later<00:01:56.330> just<00:01:56.630> by<00:01:56.750> moving<00:01:57.170> some<00:01:57.500> things<00:01:57.560> around

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
later just by moving some things around

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.600 
later just by moving some things around
making<00:01:58.280> look<00:01:58.610> all<00:01:58.790> alien<00:01:59.240> like<00:01:59.450> Oh<00:02:00.820> left<00:02:01.820> click

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
making look all alien like Oh left click

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.730 
making look all alien like Oh left click
so<00:02:04.610> there's<00:02:04.760> that<00:02:05.060> and<00:02:05.810> then<00:02:05.930> later<00:02:06.110> smooth<00:02:06.560> it

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
so there's that and then later smooth it

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:15.670 
so there's that and then later smooth it
around<00:02:11.110> there<00:02:13.600> creates<00:02:14.600> a<00:02:14.690> neat<00:02:15.050> little<00:02:15.170> scaly

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
around there creates a neat little scaly

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.730 
around there creates a neat little scaly
looking<00:02:16.160> effect<00:02:16.720> this<00:02:17.720> control<00:02:18.200> Z<00:02:18.470> that

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
looking effect this control Z that

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.070 
looking effect this control Z that
although<00:02:19.640> I<00:02:19.700> like<00:02:19.940> that<00:02:20.150> i<00:02:20.210> want<00:02:20.510> to<00:02:20.540> controls

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080

is I literally took the grab tool
inflated<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.360> size<00:02:34.060> did<00:02:35.060> something<00:02:35.390> like

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
inflated the size did something like

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:43.060 
inflated the size did something like
this<00:02:39.460> and<00:02:41.080> then<00:02:42.080> what<00:02:42.470> I<00:02:42.500> did<00:02:42.710> is<00:02:42.800> I<00:02:42.890> took<00:02:42.920> the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.920 
in-flight tool put it on subtract and
then<00:02:46.190> made<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.700> hole<00:02:46.940> for<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.210> years<00:02:47.420> and<00:02:47.750> then

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
then made a hole for the years and then

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.390 
then made a hole for the years and then
smoothed<00:02:48.230> it<00:02:48.350> out<00:02:48.500> and<00:02:48.770> play<00:02:49.070> it<00:02:49.130> with<00:02:49.280> that

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
smoothed it out and play it with that

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.510 
smoothed it out and play it with that
for<00:02:49.670> about<00:02:49.790> 10<00:02:50.330> minutes<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:52.040> mouth<00:02:52.220> and<00:02:52.489> the

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:17.500 
effect I've got the strength on too much
so<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:13.510> the<00:03:14.510> size<00:03:14.750> as<00:03:14.989> well<00:03:16.090> but<00:03:17.090> it's<00:03:17.360> a

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
so and the size as well but it's a

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:21.970 
so and the size as well but it's a
little<00:03:17.900> fluid<00:03:18.290> action<00:03:20.530> it's<00:03:21.530> real<00:03:21.739> neat

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
little fluid action it's real neat

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.040 
little fluid action it's real neat
controls<00:03:22.610> you'd<00:03:22.910> never<00:03:23.120> use<00:03:23.239> that<00:03:23.390> tool<00:03:23.810> never

use<00:03:24.260> flatten<00:03:24.620> either<00:03:24.770> never<00:03:25.100> use<00:03:25.400> layer<00:03:25.810> I'm

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
use flatten either never use layer I'm

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.440 
use flatten either never use layer I'm
sure<00:03:27.020> you<00:03:27.290> will<00:03:27.610> layer<00:03:28.610> just<00:03:28.640> adds<00:03:29.120> or

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
sure you will layer just adds or

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.030 
sure you will layer just adds or
subtracts<00:03:29.510> later<00:03:30.170> I've<00:03:30.230> got<00:03:30.380> it<00:03:30.500> on<00:03:30.620> subtract

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
subtracts later I've got it on subtract

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:34.390 
subtracts later I've got it on subtract
so<00:03:31.220> add<00:03:31.660> so<00:03:32.660> it's<00:03:32.780> adding<00:03:33.110> a<00:03:33.170> layer<00:03:33.380> this<00:03:34.250> would

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 
so add so it's adding a layer this would

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.690 
so add so it's adding a layer this would
be<00:03:34.430> good<00:03:34.670> for<00:03:34.940> defining<00:03:35.330> a<00:03:35.660> face<00:03:36.489> adding<00:03:37.489> some

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:37.700 
be good for defining a face adding some

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:45.820 
be good for defining a face adding some
weird<00:03:37.910> bumps<00:03:38.390> and<00:03:38.630> stuff<00:03:41.170> so<00:03:42.170> there's<00:03:42.350> that

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.610 

all<00:03:46.760> right<00:03:47.230> inflate<00:03:48.230> we<00:03:48.320> already<00:03:48.500> covered

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
all right inflate we already covered

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.280 
all right inflate we already covered
pinch<00:03:49.180> literally<00:03:50.180> just<00:03:50.210> pinches<00:03:50.780> an<00:03:50.900> object

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
pinch literally just pinches an object

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.680 
pinch literally just pinches an object
so<00:03:51.560> let's<00:03:51.770> go<00:03:51.920> ahead<00:03:51.950> and<00:03:52.240> increase<00:03:53.240> the<00:03:53.450> size

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
so let's go ahead and increase the size

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.450 
so let's go ahead and increase the size
so<00:03:54.050> that<00:03:54.080> you<00:03:54.230> can<00:03:54.380> see<00:03:54.890> it's<00:03:55.310> pinching<00:03:57.460> weird

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
so that you can see it's pinching weird

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.280 
so that you can see it's pinching weird
face<00:03:58.730> there<00:03:59.260> lovin<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.610> so<00:04:01.610> there's<00:04:01.760> that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
face there lovin it so there's that

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.920 
face there lovin it so there's that
smooth<00:04:03.290> we<00:04:03.650> covered<00:04:04.040> and<00:04:04.250> drawn<00:04:04.520> as<00:04:05.120> very

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
smooth we covered and drawn as very

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.660 
smooth we covered and drawn as very
inconsistent<00:04:06.680> and<00:04:06.950> I<00:04:07.040> don't<00:04:07.220> like<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.550> too

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
inconsistent and I don't like it too

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.660 
inconsistent and I don't like it too
much<00:04:08.740> so<00:04:09.740> there's<00:04:09.890> that<00:04:10.070> there's<00:04:10.280> our<00:04:10.460> object

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
much so there's that there's our object

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:15.640 
much so there's that there's our object
and<00:04:14.080> think<00:04:15.080> that<00:04:15.200> will<00:04:15.290> conclude<00:04:15.470> this

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
and think that will conclude this

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.090 
and think that will conclude this
