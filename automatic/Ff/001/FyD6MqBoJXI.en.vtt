to<00:00:53.030> FaceTime<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:53.630> family<00:00:54.050> it's<00:00:54.290> like<00:00:54.640> really

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 
to FaceTime to family it's like really

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:00.190 
to FaceTime to family it's like really
really<00:00:56.990> important<00:00:57.620> so<00:00:58.180> no<00:00:59.180> yeah<00:00:59.690> I<00:01:00.020> don't

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
really important so no yeah I don't

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.620 
really important so no yeah I don't
think<00:01:00.350> it<00:01:00.440> was<00:01:00.500> very<00:01:00.710> hard<00:01:00.980> for<00:01:01.040> us<00:01:01.280> I<00:01:01.580> think

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
think it was very hard for us I think

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.820 
think it was very hard for us I think
you<00:01:02.630> know<00:01:02.720> I<00:01:02.780> think<00:01:02.840> when<00:01:03.110> two<00:01:03.530> people<00:01:03.680> are

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:03.830 
you know I think when two people are

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:05.800 
you know I think when two people are
mutually<00:01:04.369> at<00:01:04.489> this<00:01:04.670> the<00:01:04.969> same<00:01:05.239> level<00:01:05.659> and

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
mutually at this the same level and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.899 
mutually at this the same level and
their<00:01:06.679> relationship<00:01:07.280> and<00:01:07.490> where<00:01:07.609> they<00:01:07.729> want

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
their relationship and where they want

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.639 
their relationship and where they want
to<00:01:07.999> my<00:01:08.149> kids<00:01:08.420> ago<00:01:08.630> I<00:01:08.659> think<00:01:08.929> that<00:01:09.049> really<00:01:09.259> helps

00:01:09.639 --> 00:01:09.649
