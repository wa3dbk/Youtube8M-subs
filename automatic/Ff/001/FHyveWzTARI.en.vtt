00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
it was really like straight just with

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:00.980 
it was really like straight just with
like<00:01:59.759> a<00:02:00.000> ver

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
like a ver

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.440 
like a ver
loose<00:02:01.439> wave<00:02:01.770> but<00:02:02.640> then<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.909> second<00:02:03.270> bundle

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
loose wave but then the second bundle

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.319 
loose wave but then the second bundle
was<00:02:04.200> slightly<00:02:04.470> wavy<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.220> then<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> third

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
was slightly wavy and then the third

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:10.070 
was slightly wavy and then the third
bundle<00:02:06.600> was<00:02:07.290> really<00:02:07.710> wavy<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.720> it's<00:02:09.720> like<00:02:09.899> I

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
bundle was really wavy so it's like I

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.839 
bundle was really wavy so it's like I
can<00:02:10.289> never<00:02:10.470> wear<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:10.950> hair<00:02:11.280> in<00:02:11.520> its<00:02:11.790> natural

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
can never wear this hair in its natural

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.910 
can never wear this hair in its natural
state<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.720> will<00:02:13.140> always<00:02:13.349> have<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.800> be

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
state it will always have to be

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.699 
state it will always have to be
straighten<00:02:14.370> or<00:02:14.640> curl<00:02:15.140> which<00:02:16.140> I<00:02:16.380> don't<00:02:16.500> mind

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
straighten or curl which I don't mind

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.309 
straighten or curl which I don't mind
because<00:02:17.280> most<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:17.970> time<00:02:18.180> I<00:02:18.450> do<00:02:18.569> where<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
because most of the time I do where the

understand<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.280> each<00:02:32.430> donor<00:02:32.819> has<00:02:33.600> a

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
understand the each donor has a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.000 
understand the each donor has a
different<00:02:34.290> kind<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.500> hair<00:02:34.650> you're<00:02:34.830> never

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
different kind of hair you're never

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.130

going<00:02:35.160> to<00:02:35.190> get<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.430> exact<00:02:35.819> same<00:02:36.030> bundle<00:02:36.360> but<00:02:37.080> I

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
going to get the exact same bundle but I

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.559 
going to get the exact same bundle but I
feel<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.590> company<00:02:38.010> should<00:02:38.069> at<00:02:38.280> least

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
feel like the company should at least

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.630 
feel like the company should at least
make<00:02:39.569> them<00:02:39.750> kind<00:02:40.140> of<00:02:40.290> similar<00:02:40.530> like<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.519> know

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
make them kind of similar like you know

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.460 
make them kind of similar like you know
so<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.000> person<00:02:42.209> can<00:02:42.630> wear<00:02:42.930> it<00:02:43.049> in<00:02:43.200> their<00:02:43.319> natural

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
so a person can wear it in their natural

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:47.840 
so a person can wear it in their natural
state<00:02:43.910> that's<00:02:44.910> just<00:02:45.030> me<00:02:45.150> um<00:02:45.920> the<00:02:46.920> next<00:02:47.280> con<00:02:47.519> to

the<00:02:47.970> hair<00:02:48.209> would<00:02:48.930> be<00:02:49.140> the<00:02:49.590> split<00:02:50.130> ends<00:02:50.370> you

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
the hair would be the split ends you

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.449 
the hair would be the split ends you
can't<00:02:50.940> see<00:02:51.209> them<00:02:51.420> now<00:02:51.720> because<00:02:52.590> i<00:02:53.100> went<00:02:53.160> ahead

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
can't see them now because i went ahead

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.960 
can't see them now because i went ahead
and<00:02:53.910> went<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.269> and<00:02:54.450> clip<00:02:54.750> them<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.430> wasn't

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
and went in and clip them so that wasn't

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.539 
and went in and clip them so that wasn't
really<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.360> bad<00:02:57.630> though<00:02:58.049> um<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:59.010> could<00:02:59.220> tell

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
really that bad though um you could tell

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.180 
really that bad though um you could tell
that<00:02:59.790> they<00:02:59.910> were<00:02:59.940> split<00:03:00.330> ends<00:03:00.510> like<00:03:01.319> just

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
that they were split ends like just

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:03.770 
that they were split ends like just
looking<00:03:02.580> at<00:03:02.730> you<00:03:02.910> can<00:03:03.030> see<00:03:03.120> like<00:03:03.299> split<00:03:03.630> split

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
looking at you can see like split split

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.580 
looking at you can see like split split
split<00:03:03.930> split<00:03:04.760> so<00:03:05.760> at<00:03:06.209> first<00:03:06.269> I<00:03:06.750> didn't<00:03:07.410> know<00:03:07.500> if

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
split split so at first I didn't know if

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.770 
split split so at first I didn't know if
it<00:03:07.680> was<00:03:07.769> just<00:03:07.829> a<00:03:08.040> hair<00:03:08.250> breakage<00:03:08.579> or<00:03:09.120> if<00:03:09.570> it<00:03:09.660> was

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
it was just a hair breakage or if it was

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.390 
it was just a hair breakage or if it was
split<00:03:10.049> ends<00:03:10.320> but<00:03:10.500> no<00:03:10.620> it<00:03:10.769> was<00:03:10.890> really<00:03:11.130> just<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
split ends but no it was really just the

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.190 
split ends but no it was really just the
split<00:03:11.730> ends<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.209> you<00:03:12.299> could<00:03:12.930> really<00:03:13.079> tell

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
split ends and you could really tell

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.479 
split ends and you could really tell
because<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:14.070> hair<00:03:14.310> is<00:03:14.340> layered<00:03:15.079> I<00:03:16.079> have<00:03:17.010> a<00:03:17.070> 14

because the hair is layered I have a 14
16<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:17.940> 18<00:03:18.269> so<00:03:18.570> you<00:03:18.720> could<00:03:18.870> really<00:03:19.019> tell<00:03:19.140> in

00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
16 and 18 so you could really tell in
