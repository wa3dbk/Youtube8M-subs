EVP<00:00:56.870> I<00:00:57.490> think<00:00:58.490> I<00:00:58.640> got<00:00:58.850> a<00:00:58.880> EVP<00:00:59.510> actually<00:01:01.000> when<00:01:02.000> I

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
EVP I think I got a EVP actually when I

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:05.049 
EVP I think I got a EVP actually when I
wasn't<00:01:02.330> running<00:01:02.870> the<00:01:03.370> previous<00:01:04.370> experiment<00:01:04.970> I

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
wasn't running the previous experiment I

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.850 
wasn't running the previous experiment I
just<00:01:05.239> had<00:01:05.360> the<00:01:05.480> two<00:01:05.630> phones<00:01:05.900> connected<00:01:06.500> right

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
just had the two phones connected right

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:10.300 
just had the two phones connected right
before<00:01:07.160> it<00:01:07.220> disconnected<00:01:07.850> them<00:01:08.620> so<00:01:09.620> basically

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
before it disconnected them so basically

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.270 
before it disconnected them so basically
if<00:01:10.520> you<00:01:10.640> call<00:01:10.850> one<00:01:11.090> phone<00:01:11.890> pick<00:01:12.890> up<00:01:13.010> on<00:01:13.190> the

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
if you call one phone pick up on the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.540 
if you call one phone pick up on the
other<00:01:13.460> and<00:01:14.120> put<00:01:14.330> both<00:01:14.479> on<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:14.840> speaker<00:01:15.550> since

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
other and put both on the speaker since

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.810 
other and put both on the speaker since
first<00:01:17.090> there's<00:01:17.330> audio<00:01:17.570> feedback<00:01:18.050> and<00:01:18.820> then

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
first there's audio feedback and then

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.150 
first there's audio feedback and then
there's<00:01:20.090> also<00:01:20.300> in<00:01:20.840> a<00:01:20.960> sense<00:01:21.850> radio<00:01:22.850> feedback

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
there's also in a sense radio feedback

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.920 
there's also in a sense radio feedback
relatively<00:01:25.160> speaking<00:01:25.520> I<00:01:25.910> think<00:01:26.630> it<00:01:26.750> might

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
relatively speaking I think it might

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.980 
relatively speaking I think it might
enhance<00:01:27.320> EVP<00:01:28.009> ability<00:01:28.610> I'm<00:01:29.390> going<00:01:29.660> to<00:01:29.750> try
