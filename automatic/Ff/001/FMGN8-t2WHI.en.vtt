 hello welcome choco the pepper today you 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.259
 taught how to make a delicious man 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.030
 fresh cheesecake you will see what is 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.559
 super easy for you to leave the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.480
 quantities of the ingredients of all 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.219
 ways and you do not have time to copy them 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.719
 you can see it in the description of 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.719
 video or on the blog 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.230
 let's start the cheesecake by hydrating 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.930
 the gelatin we're going to put half 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.970
 of the water we are going to stir it very well 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.460
 let's let it absorb and we 're going 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:40.370
 to heat in the microwave for about 10 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.320
 seconds will book and while 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.530
 so much are we going to start beating in the 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:48.110
 blender our cream cheese 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:51.920
 then we are going to add the sugar 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.190
 glas and the condensed milk I do this 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.770
 I did to my liking if you want to add 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.760
 less sugar or a little more sugar 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.500
 I will leave and you can try 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.100
 there is no problem you can eat in 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.869
 raw so the tests time if you feel 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.710
 they need more sugar because you put them 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.710
 a little more sugar 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.750
 Now let's add the cream and let's 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.750
 beat super well so that the cream 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.869
 lift even a little bit this does not go 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.909
 to make our cake look good 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.789
 well we believe and we are not going to add 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.459
 now the essence of vanilla and 

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.369
 then the gelatin that is already 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:37.890
 hydrated and cold is very important that 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.969
 is at room temperature so that the 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.770
 cheese well accept it here I'm going to 

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:46.349
 put on top of a cookie crust 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.659
 Mary you can enter the link that you 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:50.399
 I leave it at the end of the video to see how it 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.840
 makes the base for this kind of 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.420
 Cheesecake that does not go to the oven 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.880
 and well your mix in as many layers as 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.759
 you want and add the first layer that 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.609
 will be white refrigerate in the meantime 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.399
 Now I'm going to color my other two 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:08.289
 layers this is strawberry's fault and the 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.620
 strawberry gelatin that I previously 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:14.650
 hydrate with the water that we had left 

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:17.660
 meanwhile you can place a little 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:20.600
 of the mixture in 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:24.110
 and you go original of the cis cake to go 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.720
 seeing what color it takes and adding little to 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.740
 little because as it has the gelatine of 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.310
 Strawberry 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.980
 it brings a lot of paint and then it goes 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.810
 to put the super red mixture of a 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.600
 moment to another so I'm adding 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.180
 little by little you do not have to add 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.069
 all gelatin reserves even if 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.950
 half a cup for the end 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:50.670
 now that the bottom is curdled 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:53.400
 it took us about 20 minutes in the fridge 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.370
 let's add the other color that is the 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:59.159
 light pink we are going to level it super well 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.379
 we're going to take the air out and we 're going to 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.319
 Re-refrigerate for another 20 minutes 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.719
 in the refrigerator not in the fridge ok or 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:10.560
 be in the con g let's add the 

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:13.889
 last coat and my oscurito pink or 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:17.189
 fuchsia more or less and I'm going to level it 

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:19.560
 again I'm going to put it in the fridge about 20 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:22.620
 minutes when it's hard I'm going to add 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.079
 the gelatin this is the last layer 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.090
 I want it to be a layer and in a good couple 

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:29.280
 You can make her as fat as you 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.069
 I just wanted a little phone 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:35.209
 gelatin when it's set 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:38.099
 leave it at least three hours before 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.069
 dismantle it then decorate it with strawberries 

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:42.900
 fresh raspberry blackberry or with the 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:45.599
 fruit that you want to give it a little touch 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.579
