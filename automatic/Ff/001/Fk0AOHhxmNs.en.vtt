see it on the movie but it looks like a

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:43.280 
see it on the movie but it looks like a
a<00:00:28.779> fist<00:00:29.650> with<00:00:29.800> the<00:00:29.980> index<00:00:30.609> finger<00:00:31.650> pointing<00:00:32.650> up

national<00:00:58.000> team<00:00:58.269> training<00:00:58.690> session<00:00:59.140> i<00:00:59.430> believe

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:00.430 
national team training session i believe

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.600 
national team training session i believe
is<00:01:00.519> actually<00:01:00.850> coaching<00:01:01.150> the<00:01:01.510> White<00:01:01.720> team<00:01:02.080> here

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
is actually coaching the White team here

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.520 
is actually coaching the White team here
I<00:01:03.610> think<00:01:04.269> trying<00:01:04.479> to<00:01:04.570> steal<00:01:04.780> possession<00:01:04.989> and

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:05.530 
I think trying to steal possession and

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.670 
I think trying to steal possession and
then<00:01:06.490> attack<00:01:06.850> goal<00:01:07.150> quickly<00:01:08.140> on<00:01:08.230> a<00:01:08.260> breakaway

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
then attack goal quickly on a breakaway

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.380 
then attack goal quickly on a breakaway

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
eight times out of ten maybe more but

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.000 
eight times out of ten maybe more but
like<00:02:46.280> i<00:02:46.430> said<00:02:46.460> the<00:02:46.790> midfielder's<00:02:47.710> forwards<00:02:48.710> a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010
