 other protected than yesterday in this clip work our little card holder 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.840
 and it the customizable pen in this case for those who already know the 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.400
 product is protected that is worn because the question of doing with a man 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.190
 a flexible and transparent plastic 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.950
 and percent is in coma you have the opportunity for a commonplace hundred percent 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.450
 printed matter that slips inside 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.450
 whether for all products from elsewhere 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.960
 and so their trumps the moment pushed you to never get tired 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.360
 to see the bar for example the Egypt photo stream 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.990
 you can all removed and percent and then reprint them what you 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.100
 want at home for riesling% and well inside 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.690
 % and so here 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.240
 al gore I remember that in France there are two formats protect anyone 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.730
 has one that opens like that with the strain 30 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.130
 and one that goes out that way so with the strain of cholera the strain to 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.250
 left 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.250
 so assured libel you have that coli 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.980
 not sure though that one because he was the coach was the most 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.069
 current in France 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:59.000
 but if you ever want each other 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.310
 % and you have to contact 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.200
 he does not buy the wallet format 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.410
 in e then a little dot on the pen to sign to show you 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.629
 how you can customize 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.719
 so if you ever want palestine italians could shoot them then 

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:18.609
 screwed up the little younes the little something apart of course 

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:19.700
 martin 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.860
 so the same you can print any photo and% and to 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.709
 tighten your image actually inside the tube pe and then so 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.649
 put down the road 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.559
 and then we promise to qualify them anyway it's not complicated I 

00:02:32.559 --> 00:02:34.409
 do not need any instructions for use 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.279
 and so then vote give you have your picture insert one in your pen 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:42.709
 so so for these products there you can really customize 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:44.349
 completely completely 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:46.389
