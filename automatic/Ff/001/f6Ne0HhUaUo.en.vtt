some pretty colors nothing very fancy

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.679 
some pretty colors nothing very fancy
nothing<00:01:42.270> expensive<00:01:42.860> I<00:01:43.880> just<00:01:44.880> cut<00:01:45.390> them<00:01:45.540> out

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
nothing expensive I just cut them out

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.530 
nothing expensive I just cut them out
and<00:01:45.750> use<00:01:46.110> them<00:01:46.850> lots<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.030> times<00:01:48.210> people<00:01:48.390> will

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
and use them lots of times people will

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.590 
and use them lots of times people will
use<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:49.020> side<00:01:49.350> tabs<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:50.369> things<00:01:50.700> like<00:01:50.970> their

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
use the side tabs for things like their

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.990 
use the side tabs for things like their
big<00:01:51.840> section<00:01:52.350> headings<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.310> one<00:01:53.520> reason<00:01:53.880> that

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
big section headings and one reason that

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.359 
big section headings and one reason that
I<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.350> goes<00:01:55.649> ahead<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.219> it

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
I do it is because it goes ahead and it

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.730 
I do it is because it goes ahead and it
uses<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:57.000> side<00:01:57.960> tabs<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.320> are<00:01:58.439> already

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
uses the side tabs that are already

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.389 
uses the side tabs that are already
created<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.640> my<00:01:59.820> 365<00:02:00.600> planner<00:02:00.930> for<00:02:01.770> october

november december any of the months i

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.999 
november december any of the months i
really<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.640> way<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.909> happens<00:02:06.890> but<00:02:07.890> in

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
really like the way that happens but in

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.770 
really like the way that happens but in
order<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.340> use<00:02:08.580> my<00:02:08.729> planner<00:02:08.970> most<00:02:09.239> effectively

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
order to use my planner most effectively

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.670 
order to use my planner most effectively
it<00:02:10.140> actually<00:02:10.679> needs<00:02:10.860> some<00:02:11.129> top

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
it actually needs some top

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.360 
it actually needs some top
tabs<00:02:12.099> as<00:02:12.489> well<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.870> let<00:02:13.989> me<00:02:14.140> sort<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.799> show<00:02:15.310> you

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
tabs as well and let me sort of show you

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.050 
tabs as well and let me sort of show you
that<00:02:15.670> so<00:02:15.939> I'm<00:02:16.030> going<00:02:16.150> to<00:02:16.209> close<00:02:16.420> the<00:02:16.659> planner

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
that so I'm going to close the planner

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.059 
that so I'm going to close the planner
and<00:02:19.060> turn<00:02:19.390> it<00:02:19.540> over<00:02:19.659> so<00:02:19.989> you<00:02:20.049> can<00:02:20.230> see<00:02:20.439> the<00:02:20.620> very

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
and turn it over so you can see the very

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.339 
and turn it over so you can see the very
top<00:02:21.489> of<00:02:21.519> the<00:02:21.730> planner<00:02:22.030> and<00:02:22.750> you<00:02:22.840> can<00:02:23.019> see<00:02:23.319> that

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
top of the planner and you can see that

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.649 
top of the planner and you can see that

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
you can see them very well from this

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:33.059 
you can see them very well from this
point<00:02:30.040> of<00:02:30.189> view<00:02:30.219> but<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.299> do<00:02:31.420> use<00:02:31.959> those<00:02:32.319> all<00:02:32.620> the

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
point of view but I do use those all the

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.569 
point of view but I do use those all the
time<00:02:33.359> so<00:02:34.359> first<00:02:34.659> I<00:02:34.900> use<00:02:35.170> it<00:02:35.349> today<00:02:35.500> marker<00:02:36.010> for

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
time so first I use it today marker for

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.479 
time so first I use it today marker for
the<00:02:37.269> month<00:02:37.769> even<00:02:38.769> though<00:02:38.889> I<00:02:38.920> have<00:02:39.159> a<00:02:39.189> monthly

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
the month even though I have a monthly

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:41.339 
the month even though I have a monthly
tab<00:02:39.730> sometimes<00:02:40.299> those<00:02:40.540> tabs<00:02:40.810> can<00:02:41.079> kind<00:02:41.290> of

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:41.349 
tab sometimes those tabs can kind of

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:44.339 
tab sometimes those tabs can kind of
hide<00:02:41.939> those<00:02:42.939> side<00:02:43.239> tabs<00:02:43.510> can<00:02:43.900> kind<00:02:44.109> of<00:02:44.139> hide

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
hide those side tabs can kind of hide

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:47.399 
hide those side tabs can kind of hide
and<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.370> today<00:02:45.730> marker<00:02:46.150> right<00:02:46.540> on<00:02:46.810> top<00:02:47.109> is

00:02:47.399 --> 00:02:47.409 
and so this today marker right on top is

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:50.159 
and so this today marker right on top is
going<00:02:47.859> to<00:02:48.069> make<00:02:48.790> sure<00:02:49.060> that<00:02:49.359> i<00:02:49.389> can<00:02:49.450> find<00:02:49.959> the

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:50.169 
going to make sure that i can find the

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.369 
going to make sure that i can find the
pages<00:02:50.530> that<00:02:50.560> i<00:02:50.739> need<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:52.239> other<00:02:52.510> to<00:02:53.019> limit

00:02:53.369 --> 00:02:53.379 
pages that i need the other to limit

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.229 
pages that i need the other to limit
mark<00:02:53.769> our<00:02:53.950> use<00:02:54.189> and<00:02:54.220> it's<00:02:54.519> a<00:02:54.579> little<00:02:54.790> bit<00:02:54.879> wider

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
mark our use and it's a little bit wider

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.020 
mark our use and it's a little bit wider
so<00:02:55.599> that<00:02:55.750> i<00:02:55.780> can<00:02:55.870> tell<00:02:55.989> the<00:02:56.319> difference<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:57.129> the
