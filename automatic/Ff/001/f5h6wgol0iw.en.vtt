00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
all right so we're gonna give this buick

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.509 
all right so we're gonna give this buick
here<00:00:03.330> a<00:00:03.360> road<00:00:03.689> test<00:00:05.870> it<00:00:06.870> starts<00:00:07.259> right<00:00:07.440> up<00:00:10.519> so

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
here a road test it starts right up so

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.340 
here a road test it starts right up so
the<00:00:11.730> only<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.679> only<00:00:13.679> warning<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.519> we<00:00:14.639> get<00:00:14.880> is

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
the only the only warning that we get is

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:19.970 
the only the only warning that we get is
the<00:00:16.350> tire<00:00:16.560> pressure<00:00:17.010> warning<00:00:17.369> i<00:00:18.650> just<00:00:19.650> changed

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
the tire pressure warning i just changed

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.470 
the tire pressure warning i just changed
the<00:00:20.070> oil<00:00:20.100> so<00:00:20.910> that's<00:00:21.240> that<00:00:21.750> should<00:00:22.109> be<00:00:22.230> reset

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
the oil so that's that should be reset

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.650 
the oil so that's that should be reset
the<00:00:24.740> we<00:00:25.740> put<00:00:25.980> fix-a-flat<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.880> one<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.300> in

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
the we put fix-a-flat in one of the in

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.830 
the we put fix-a-flat in one of the in
one<00:00:27.960> of<00:00:28.019> the<00:00:28.109> tires<00:00:28.349> and<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.800> think<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.840> that

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
one of the tires and I think that that

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.470 
one of the tires and I think that that
stuff<00:00:31.199> may<00:00:31.410> have<00:00:31.529> clogged<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.000> tire

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
stuff may have clogged one of the tire

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.959 
stuff may have clogged one of the tire
pressure<00:00:33.840> sensors<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:34.829> even<00:00:35.550> though<00:00:35.640> all<00:00:35.820> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
pressure sensors so even though all the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.830 
pressure sensors so even though all the
tires<00:00:36.180> are<00:00:36.390> fine<00:00:37.640> it<00:00:38.640> says<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.360> there's<00:00:39.600> low

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
tires are fine it says that there's low

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.340 
tires are fine it says that there's low
tire<00:00:40.110> pressure<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.710> some<00:00:40.860> reason<00:00:42.110> that's<00:00:43.110> a

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
tire pressure for some reason that's a

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.850 
tire pressure for some reason that's a
minor<00:00:43.590> annoyance<00:00:45.739> but<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:48.379> all<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.559> gears

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
minor annoyance but so all the gears

00:00:49.860 --> 00:01:12.679 
minor annoyance but so all the gears
work<00:00:50.100> just<00:00:50.399> fine

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.210 

turn<00:01:13.689> signals<00:01:14.140> work<00:01:14.409> all<00:01:15.219> the<00:01:15.579> lights<00:01:15.759> work

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
turn signals work all the lights work

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.570 
turn signals work all the lights work
brights

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.880 

so<00:01:25.510> like<00:01:25.720> I<00:01:25.870> said<00:01:25.930> in<00:01:26.440> the<00:01:26.980> previous<00:01:27.720> video

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
so like I said in the previous video

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.160 
so like I said in the previous video
this<00:01:29.890> card<00:01:30.190> gets<00:01:30.370> pretty<00:01:30.670> good<00:01:30.850> gas<00:01:31.090> mileage

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
this card gets pretty good gas mileage

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.030 
this card gets pretty good gas mileage
it's<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:33.060> we<00:01:34.060> typically<00:01:34.540> see<00:01:34.990> somewhere<00:01:35.860> in<00:01:35.980> the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:36.040 
it's a we typically see somewhere in the

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.130 
it's a we typically see somewhere in the
neighborhood<00:01:36.400> of<00:01:36.430> about<00:01:36.700> 25<00:01:37.240> on<00:01:37.630> average

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
neighborhood of about 25 on average

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.350 
neighborhood of about 25 on average
which<00:01:38.740> is<00:01:38.890> hard<00:01:39.070> to<00:01:39.130> believe<00:01:39.190> but<00:01:39.850> that<00:01:42.360> 3.8

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
which is hard to believe but that 3.8

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.900 
which is hard to believe but that 3.8
liter<00:01:43.600> motor<00:01:44.190> does<00:01:45.190> real<00:01:45.490> well<00:01:45.640> on<00:01:45.670> the

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:45.910 
liter motor does real well on the

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.870 
liter motor does real well on the
highway<00:01:46.240> and<00:01:46.480> we<00:01:46.540> tend<00:01:46.930> to<00:01:47.020> do<00:01:47.430> we<00:01:48.430> tend<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.700> do

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
highway and we tend to do we tend to do

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.060 
highway and we tend to do we tend to do
more<00:01:49.060> highway<00:01:49.480> commuting<00:01:49.960> than<00:01:50.110> we<00:01:50.230> do<00:01:50.410> city

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
more highway commuting than we do city

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:57.110 
more highway commuting than we do city
and<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:53.590> does<00:01:53.860> good<00:01:54.160> pretty<00:01:55.000> good<00:01:55.240> on<00:01:55.390> gas<00:01:55.600> so

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
and it does good pretty good on gas so

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.640 
and it does good pretty good on gas so
my<00:01:58.120> wife<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.510> I<00:01:58.630> have<00:01:58.750> been<00:01:58.900> driving<00:01:59.080> this<00:01:59.440> for

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 
my wife and I have been driving this for

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.230 
my wife and I have been driving this for
about<00:01:59.770> four<00:02:00.100> years<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:01.180> we<00:02:01.240> bought<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.200> car

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
about four years and we bought the car

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.700 
about four years and we bought the car
when<00:02:04.240> it<00:02:04.480> had<00:02:04.660> about<00:02:04.930> a<00:02:04.990> hundred<00:02:05.320> thousand

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
when it had about a hundred thousand

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:10.080 
when it had about a hundred thousand
miles<00:02:05.890> on<00:02:06.130> it<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:06.490> we've<00:02:07.350> had<00:02:08.350> it<00:02:08.560> for<00:02:09.090> about

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
miles on it and we've had it for about

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.250 
miles on it and we've had it for about
thirty-five<00:02:10.720> of<00:02:10.750> those<00:02:11.760> and<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:13.330> has<00:02:13.480> been<00:02:13.720> a

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
thirty-five of those and it has been a

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.630 
thirty-five of those and it has been a
good<00:02:14.680> car<00:02:14.920> for<00:02:15.160> us<00:02:19.350> we<00:02:20.350> have<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.640> dealer

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
good car for us we have the dealer

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.370 
good car for us we have the dealer
service<00:02:22.330> records<00:02:23.280> from<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:25.510> previous<00:02:25.960> owners

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
service records from the previous owners

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.540 
service records from the previous owners
in<00:02:26.770> Wisconsin<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:28.260> they<00:02:29.260> took<00:02:29.590> meticulous

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
in Wisconsin and they took meticulous

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.760 
in Wisconsin and they took meticulous
care<00:02:30.790> of<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.060> car<00:02:31.330> it<00:02:32.020> was<00:02:32.140> an<00:02:32.260> older<00:02:32.530> couple

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
care of the car it was an older couple

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.370 
care of the car it was an older couple
that<00:02:32.950> basically<00:02:33.700> used<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.090> car<00:02:34.330> for<00:02:34.630> going

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
that basically used the car for going

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:41.960 
that basically used the car for going
from<00:02:35.650> Wisconsin<00:02:36.280> down<00:02:36.459> to<00:02:36.700> Florida<00:02:37.150> I<00:02:37.209> think

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.880 

so<00:02:42.970> now<00:02:43.120> this<00:02:43.299> car<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:44.049> will<00:02:44.170> go<00:02:44.379> when<00:02:44.620> you<00:02:44.739> need

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
so now this car it will go when you need

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.180 
so now this car it will go when you need
it<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.840> it's<00:02:46.840> got<00:02:46.989> good<00:02:47.230> acceleration<00:02:47.950> on<00:02:48.099> the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
it to it's got good acceleration on the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:54.400 
it to it's got good acceleration on the
highway<00:02:48.549> good<00:02:48.849> passing<00:02:49.769> of<00:02:50.769> course<00:02:51.480> shifting

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
highway good passing of course shifting

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.670 
highway good passing of course shifting
shifting<00:02:55.410> still<00:02:55.680> works<00:02:55.890> just<00:02:56.160> fine<00:02:57.470> smooth<00:02:58.470> as

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
shifting still works just fine smooth as

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.940 
shifting still works just fine smooth as
can<00:02:58.860> be<00:02:59.330> so<00:03:00.330> I<00:03:00.360> was<00:03:00.750> saying<00:03:00.930> that<00:03:01.110> the<00:03:01.560> previous

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
can be so I was saying that the previous

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.880 
can be so I was saying that the previous
owners<00:03:02.690> regularly<00:03:03.690> change<00:03:03.960> the<00:03:04.080> oil<00:03:04.290> at<00:03:04.650> the

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
owners regularly change the oil at the

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.790 
owners regularly change the oil at the
dealer<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.430> we<00:03:05.790> have<00:03:06.030> all<00:03:06.420> of<00:03:06.780> their<00:03:07.320> dealer

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
dealer and we have all of their dealer

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.740 
dealer and we have all of their dealer
records<00:03:09.440> so<00:03:10.440> shows<00:03:11.130> every<00:03:11.550> every<00:03:11.940> 3,000<00:03:12.570> miles

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
records so shows every every 3,000 miles

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.930 
records so shows every every 3,000 miles
they<00:03:13.140> changing<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.800> oil<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:14.370> having<00:03:14.670> little

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
they changing the oil and having little

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.030 
they changing the oil and having little
things<00:03:15.180> taken<00:03:15.510> care<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.780> at<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:15.990> dealer<00:03:16.380> now

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
things taken care of at the dealer now

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.040 
things taken care of at the dealer now
we<00:03:17.580> didn't<00:03:17.820> have<00:03:17.940> a<00:03:17.970> dealer<00:03:18.300> we<00:03:18.420> trusted<00:03:18.870> here

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.050 
we didn't have a dealer we trusted here

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.410 
we didn't have a dealer we trusted here
in<00:03:19.140> New<00:03:19.260> York<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:19.800> we<00:03:20.700> tended<00:03:21.000> to<00:03:21.060> do<00:03:21.240> that

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
in New York so we tended to do that

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.720 
in New York so we tended to do that
stuff<00:03:22.790> from<00:03:23.790> a<00:03:23.940> smaller<00:03:24.450> shop<00:03:24.780> that<00:03:25.110> we<00:03:25.200> trust

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
stuff from a smaller shop that we trust

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.040 
stuff from a smaller shop that we trust
and<00:03:27.110> so<00:03:28.110> we've<00:03:28.590> continued<00:03:29.160> to<00:03:29.190> keep<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:30.060> keep

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:31.050 
and so we've continued to keep the keep

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.040 
and so we've continued to keep the keep
the<00:03:31.230> car<00:03:31.410> in<00:03:31.440> good<00:03:31.740> shape<00:03:31.950> I<00:03:32.220> change<00:03:32.490> my<00:03:32.730> oil<00:03:33.050> we

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
the car in good shape I change my oil we

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.530 
the car in good shape I change my oil we
did<00:03:34.260> have<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.800> transmission<00:03:35.670> the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
did have the transmission the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.080 
did have the transmission the
transmission<00:03:36.570> fluid<00:03:37.320> flushed<00:03:37.920> at<00:03:38.730> about<00:03:39.060> a

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
transmission fluid flushed at about a

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.930 
transmission fluid flushed at about a
hundred<00:03:39.450> and<00:03:39.510> ten<00:03:39.750> thousand<00:03:40.320> I'd<00:03:41.160> say<00:03:41.400> that

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
hundred and ten thousand I'd say that

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.150 
hundred and ten thousand I'd say that
was<00:03:42.090> recommended<00:03:42.570> to<00:03:42.930> us<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:43.440> we<00:03:43.650> went<00:03:44.010> ahead

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
was recommended to us so we went ahead

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.580 
was recommended to us so we went ahead
and<00:03:44.310> did<00:03:44.490> that<00:03:44.990> there<00:03:45.990> wasn't<00:03:46.170> anything<00:03:46.440> wrong

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
and did that there wasn't anything wrong

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.580 
and did that there wasn't anything wrong
with<00:03:46.980> the<00:03:47.070> transmission<00:03:47.390> there<00:03:48.390> still<00:03:48.600> is<00:03:48.780> but

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
with the transmission there still is but

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.320 
with the transmission there still is but
it<00:03:49.830> was<00:03:49.920> sort<00:03:50.130> of<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.280> preventative<00:03:50.850> thing<00:03:51.060> so

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
it was sort of a preventative thing so

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:57.790 
it was sort of a preventative thing so
we<00:03:51.450> did<00:03:51.630> that<00:03:51.780> at<00:03:51.990> a<00:03:52.020> hundred<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.440> ten<00:03:52.620> or<00:03:52.800> so

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:57.800 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.370

even<00:04:22.430> in<00:04:22.760> braking<00:04:23.150> goes<00:04:23.510> straight<00:04:24.550> so<00:04:25.550> I<00:04:25.930> can't

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930
