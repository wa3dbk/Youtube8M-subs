00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
believe me the animals will so I just

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.450 
believe me the animals will so I just
want<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.899> make<00:01:45.990> sure<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.560> even<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.189> ground

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
want to make sure that even the ground

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.230 
want to make sure that even the ground
around<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:48.240> get<00:01:48.869> some<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.229> this

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
around it get some of this

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.960 
around it get some of this
this<00:01:51.049> will<00:01:51.229> also<00:01:51.409> work<00:01:51.829> on<00:01:52.009> rabbits<00:01:52.549> as<00:01:52.729> well

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
this will also work on rabbits as well

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.639 
this will also work on rabbits as well
but<00:01:53.210> you'd<00:01:53.329> have<00:01:53.360> to<00:01:53.720> spray<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:54.200> more<00:01:54.439> often
