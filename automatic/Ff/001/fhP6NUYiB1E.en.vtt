right<00:00:17.970> now<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.210> immediately<00:00:18.840> sent<00:00:19.320> CLG<00:00:19.890> back

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
right now it immediately sent CLG back

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.980

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
to get the inhibitor there now they can

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.550 
to get the inhibitor there now they can
pull<00:00:24.029> back<00:00:24.180> prepare<00:00:26.810> sloan<00:00:27.810> themselves<00:00:28.410> down
