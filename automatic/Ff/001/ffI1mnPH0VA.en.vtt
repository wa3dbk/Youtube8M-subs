00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:01.730 

yes<00:03:59.560> lots<00:04:00.490> of<00:04:00.610> stroke

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:01.740 
yes lots of stroke

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:06.200 
yes lots of stroke
alright<00:04:02.730> so<00:04:03.240> now<00:04:03.570> we're<00:04:03.870> going<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:04.970> judge<00:04:05.970> the

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
alright so now we're going to judge the

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:11.240 
alright so now we're going to judge the
wind<00:04:08.180> blowing<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.450> way<00:04:09.780> so<00:04:09.840> i<00:04:10.590> guess<00:04:11.100> the

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
wind blowing that way so i guess the

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.490 
wind blowing that way so i guess the
weak<00:04:11.600> character<00:04:12.600> in<00:04:12.870> it<00:04:12.900> right<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.260> first

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
weak character in it right the first
