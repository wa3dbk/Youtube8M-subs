you but an important video for you
regarding<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.380> topic<00:00:10.590> of<00:00:11.059> vegetables<00:00:12.059> now<00:00:12.269> I

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
regarding the topic of vegetables now I

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.120 
regarding the topic of vegetables now I
don't<00:00:12.690> want<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.960> talk<00:00:13.139> about<00:00:13.200> regurgitate<00:00:14.099> a

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
don't want to talk about regurgitate a

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:15.770 
don't want to talk about regurgitate a
lot<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.549> information<00:00:15.030> you<00:00:15.120> probably<00:00:15.540> know

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
lot of the information you probably know

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.900 
lot of the information you probably know
but<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.230> have<00:00:16.529> to<00:00:16.740> hit<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.039> couple<00:00:17.369> main<00:00:17.520> points

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
but I have to hit the couple main points

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.429 
but I have to hit the couple main points
before<00:00:18.060> I<00:00:18.240> get<00:00:18.449> into<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.750> cool<00:00:18.900> stuff<00:00:19.230> that

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
before I get into the cool stuff that

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.560 
before I get into the cool stuff that
you<00:00:19.740> probably<00:00:19.949> don't<00:00:20.430> know<00:00:20.699> about<00:00:20.730> vegetables

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
you probably don't know about vegetables

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.170 
you probably don't know about vegetables
and<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.260> role<00:00:22.500> that<00:00:22.529> they<00:00:22.890> play<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.490> our<00:00:23.820> quest

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
and the role that they play in our quest

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.330 
and the role that they play in our quest
to<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.960> know<00:00:25.050> be<00:00:25.230> as<00:00:25.320> lean<00:00:25.529> as<00:00:25.560> possible<00:00:26.220> and

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
to you know be as lean as possible and

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.939 
to you know be as lean as possible and
have<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> nice<00:00:26.699> muscular<00:00:27.630> body<00:00:27.840> so<00:00:28.470> basically

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
have a nice muscular body so basically

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.650 
have a nice muscular body so basically
what<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.279> comes<00:00:29.310> down<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.670> is<00:00:29.970> vegetables<00:00:30.510> are

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
what it comes down to is vegetables are

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.170 
what it comes down to is vegetables are
packed<00:00:31.019> with<00:00:31.289> you<00:00:31.560> know<00:00:31.759> vitamins<00:00:32.759> minerals

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
packed with you know vitamins minerals

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.850 
packed with you know vitamins minerals
antioxidants<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:34.230> they're<00:00:34.350> loaded<00:00:34.559> with

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
antioxidants and they're loaded with

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.560 
antioxidants and they're loaded with
fiber<00:00:35.100> all<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.730> stuff's<00:00:35.969> awesome<00:00:36.210> that's

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
fiber all that stuff's awesome that's

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.380 
fiber all that stuff's awesome that's
great<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:36.899> our<00:00:36.960> bodies<00:00:37.550> but<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.760> part<00:00:39.329> that

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
great for our bodies but the part that

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.299 
great for our bodies but the part that
we<00:00:39.660> don't<00:00:40.050> really<00:00:40.350> pay<00:00:40.620> attention<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
we don't really pay attention to and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.819 
we don't really pay attention to and
that's<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.520> weakness<00:00:42.090> in<00:00:42.360> my<00:00:42.780> particular<00:00:43.140> diet

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
that's a weakness in my particular diet

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.150 
that's a weakness in my particular diet
is<00:00:44.570> consuming<00:00:45.570> enough<00:00:45.899> vegetables<00:00:46.590> for<00:00:46.890> this

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
is consuming enough vegetables for this

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.700 
is consuming enough vegetables for this
reason<00:00:47.730> when<00:00:48.719> we're<00:00:48.870> trying<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.230> build<00:00:49.530> lean

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
reason when we're trying to build lean

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.910 
reason when we're trying to build lean
muscle<00:00:49.739> without<00:00:50.160> fat<00:00:50.600> we<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.840> not<00:00:52.050> want<00:00:52.500> spikes

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
muscle without fat we do not want spikes

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.400 
muscle without fat we do not want spikes
of<00:00:53.129> insulin<00:00:53.579> okay<00:00:54.059> we<00:00:54.210> do<00:00:54.420> not<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:55.170> that

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
of insulin okay we do not want that

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.549 
of insulin okay we do not want that
unless<00:00:56.070> it's<00:00:56.340> strategically<00:00:56.550> planned<00:00:57.559> around

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
unless it's strategically planned around

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.349 
unless it's strategically planned around
our<00:00:58.800> workouts<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.430> certain<00:00:59.699> times<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.180> day

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
our workouts in certain times of the day

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.349 
our workouts in certain times of the day
so<00:01:01.109> incorporating<00:01:01.859> vegetables<00:01:02.789> in<00:01:03.030> certain

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
so incorporating vegetables in certain

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.710 
so incorporating vegetables in certain
fiber<00:01:03.600> sources<00:01:04.229> into<00:01:05.040> our<00:01:05.129> diet<00:01:05.720> specifically

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
fiber sources into our diet specifically

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.590 
fiber sources into our diet specifically
when<00:01:07.200> we're<00:01:07.350> consuming<00:01:07.830> carbohydrates<00:01:08.600> slows

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
when we're consuming carbohydrates slows

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.230 
when we're consuming carbohydrates slows
down<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.290> release<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.400> insulin<00:01:11.970> spike

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
down the release of that insulin spike

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.200 
down the release of that insulin spike
so<00:01:12.650> basically<00:01:13.650> combining<00:01:14.310> vegetables<00:01:15.030> with

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
so basically combining vegetables with

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.270 
so basically combining vegetables with
your<00:01:15.360> carbohydrates<00:01:16.110> is<00:01:16.380> extremely

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
your carbohydrates is extremely

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.789 
your carbohydrates is extremely
important<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.090> we<00:01:18.540> want<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.810> maintain<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> level

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
important if we want to maintain a level

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.280 
important if we want to maintain a level
steady<00:01:20.759> rise<00:01:21.119> in<00:01:21.509> glucose<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.200> our

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
steady rise in glucose in our

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.870 
steady rise in glucose in our
bloodstream<00:01:22.530> instead<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.430> insulin

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
bloodstream instead of that insulin

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.510 
bloodstream instead of that insulin
spike<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.450> huge<00:01:24.869> part<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.830> other<00:01:25.860> cool

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
spike that's a huge part the other cool

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.760 
spike that's a huge part the other cool
thing<00:01:26.850> about<00:01:26.880> vegetables<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.470> fact<00:01:28.680> that

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
thing about vegetables is the fact that

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.890 
thing about vegetables is the fact that
certain<00:01:29.009> fibers<00:01:29.640> and<00:01:29.850> vegetables<00:01:30.390> okay<00:01:30.600> are

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
certain fibers and vegetables okay are

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.440 
certain fibers and vegetables okay are
shown<00:01:31.290> to<00:01:31.530> make<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:32.040> insulin<00:01:32.520> receptors<00:01:33.119> on

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
shown to make the insulin receptors on

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.870 
shown to make the insulin receptors on
our<00:01:33.750> muscle<00:01:34.200> more<00:01:34.560> sensitive<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.729> insulin

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
our muscle more sensitive to insulin

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.060 
our muscle more sensitive to insulin
meaning<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:37.350> are<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.650> to<00:01:37.860> have<00:01:38.040> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
meaning that we are going to have a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.460 
meaning that we are going to have a
better<00:01:38.400> chance<00:01:38.880> at<00:01:39.210> gaining<00:01:39.540> muscle<00:01:40.229> and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
better chance at gaining muscle and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.999 
better chance at gaining muscle and
losing<00:01:41.189> fat<00:01:41.420> because<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.840> okay<00:01:43.500> we<00:01:43.680> want

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
losing fat because of that okay we want

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.609 
losing fat because of that okay we want
the<00:01:44.460> receptors<00:01:45.030> on<00:01:45.180> our<00:01:45.270> muscles<00:01:45.689> sensitive

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
the receptors on our muscles sensitive

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.230 
the receptors on our muscles sensitive
to<00:01:46.770> insulin<00:01:46.860> that's<00:01:47.220> what<00:01:47.369> we<00:01:47.520> want<00:01:47.850> we<00:01:48.030> don't

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
to insulin that's what we want we don't

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.450 
to insulin that's what we want we don't
want<00:01:48.360> them<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.720> be<00:01:48.780> sensitive<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.920> that's<00:01:50.159> very

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
want them to be sensitive so that's very

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.630 
want them to be sensitive so that's very
important<00:01:50.970> to<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.450> understand<00:01:51.960> now<00:01:52.640> moving

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
years that's I could do like a 20 minute

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.859 
years that's I could do like a 20 minute
video<00:02:01.439> on<00:02:01.500> but<00:02:02.310> basically<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:03.299> main<00:02:03.450> point<00:02:03.719> is

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
main defenses to this is cruciferous

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.710 
main defenses to this is cruciferous
vegetables<00:03:17.280> okay<00:03:17.520> meaning<00:03:18.090> vegetables<00:03:18.570> like

that effect of the xenoestrogens once
once<00:03:32.040> consumed<00:03:32.459> our<00:03:32.640> body<00:03:32.790> so<00:03:32.910> it's<00:03:33.060> very<00:03:33.180> very

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
once consumed our body so it's very very

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:34.970 
once consumed our body so it's very very
important<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:33.930> helps<00:03:34.380> us<00:03:34.530> stay<00:03:34.740> lean

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
important and that helps us stay lean

effect that is negated and thought by
these<00:04:33.270> vegetables<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:33.960> fact<00:04:34.200> that<00:04:34.320> it's

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
these vegetables the fact that it's

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.110 
these vegetables the fact that it's
going<00:04:34.920> to<00:04:34.980> slow<00:04:35.220> down<00:04:35.250> your<00:04:35.610> insulin<00:04:36.030> and

you know a vegetables go go bad quicker
and<00:05:19.320> it's<00:05:19.950> it's<00:05:20.670> a<00:05:20.850> little<00:05:20.970> bit<00:05:21.150> of<00:05:21.240> a

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
and it's it's a little bit of a

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.970 
and it's it's a little bit of a
discipline<00:05:21.810> but<00:05:22.170> you<00:05:22.260> got<00:05:22.410> to<00:05:22.530> do<00:05:22.620> that<00:05:22.770> you

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:22.980 
discipline but you got to do that you

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.400 
discipline but you got to do that you
got<00:05:23.100> to<00:05:23.220> do<00:05:23.310> that<00:05:23.430> if<00:05:23.580> you<00:05:23.670> want<00:05:23.940> to<00:05:24.000> have<00:05:24.410> the
