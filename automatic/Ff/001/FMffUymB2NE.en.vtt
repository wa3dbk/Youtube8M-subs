if<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.820> was<00:00:29.939> actually<00:00:30.119> able<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.539> stream<00:00:30.840> in<00:00:30.960> 720p

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
if I was actually able to stream in 720p

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.830 
if I was actually able to stream in 720p
because<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.759> problem<00:00:33.030> i<00:00:33.270> was<00:00:33.390> having<00:00:33.450> before

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
because the problem i was having before

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.490 
because the problem i was having before
was<00:00:34.800> twitches<00:00:35.640> servers<00:00:36.149> given<00:00:36.750> my<00:00:36.870> location

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
was twitches servers given my location

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.950 
was twitches servers given my location
weren't<00:00:37.890> giving<00:00:38.160> me<00:00:38.340> the<00:00:38.879> ability<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.480> utilize

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
weren't giving me the ability to utilize

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.119 
weren't giving me the ability to utilize
my<00:00:40.230> bandwidth<00:00:40.820> which<00:00:41.820> caused<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:43.129> significant

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
my bandwidth which caused a significant

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.660 
my bandwidth which caused a significant
amount<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.430> leg<00:00:44.840> and<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.410> end<00:00:46.530> result<00:00:46.710> was<00:00:47.219> me

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
amount of leg and the end result was me

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.110 
amount of leg and the end result was me
not<00:00:47.910> having<00:00:48.149> streams<00:00:48.600> because<00:00:48.899> they<00:00:49.620> were

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
not having streams because they were

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.939 
not having streams because they were
unentertaining<00:00:51.120> because<00:00:51.899> people<00:00:52.800> were

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
unentertaining because people were

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.580 
unentertaining because people were
thrown<00:00:53.280> off<00:00:53.640> by<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.059> leg<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:55.140> randomness

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
thrown off by the leg and the randomness

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.000 
thrown off by the leg and the randomness
of<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.890> live<00:00:56.160> stream<00:00:56.539> so<00:00:57.539> I<00:00:57.899> sorted<00:00:58.829> that<00:00:58.980> out

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
of the live stream so I sorted that out

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.680 
of the live stream so I sorted that out
