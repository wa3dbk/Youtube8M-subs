00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
little playing we're going to talk about

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.089 
little playing we're going to talk about
the<00:00:24.119> pedal<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.420> little<00:00:24.630> bit<00:00:24.779> let's<00:00:25.109> jump<00:00:26.010> right

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
the pedal a little bit let's jump right

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.339 
the pedal a little bit let's jump right
in<00:00:26.340> now<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.210> Terai<00:00:27.480> echo<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.869> weird<00:00:28.170> one

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
in now the Terai echo is a weird one

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.890 
in now the Terai echo is a weird one
because<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.369> is<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.490> hybrid<00:00:29.849> effect<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.599> uses

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
because it is a hybrid effect it uses

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.580 
because it is a hybrid effect it uses
bosses<00:00:31.349> MDP<00:00:31.949> processing<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.300> combine<00:00:33.750> delay

reverb<00:00:35.399> with<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.329> heavily<00:00:36.750> modulated

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
sound and then a frequency based filter

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.330 
sound and then a frequency based filter
all<00:00:41.190> on<00:00:41.520> top<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.820> it<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.329> uses<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.559> processing

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
all on top of it and uses the processing

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.490 
all on top of it and uses the processing
to<00:00:44.879> make<00:00:45.030> all<00:00:45.239> those<00:00:45.450> effects<00:00:45.809> very<00:00:46.079> dependent

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
to make all those effects very dependent

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.369 
to make all those effects very dependent
on<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.680> way<00:00:46.829> you<00:00:46.890> play<00:00:47.280> your<00:00:47.670> dynamics<00:00:48.390> and

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
on the way you play your dynamics and

00:00:49.379 --> 00:01:25.219 
on the way you play your dynamics and
it's<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.070> fascinating<00:00:50.610> effect

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.250 

so<00:01:26.229> as<00:01:27.010> we<00:01:27.340> said<00:01:27.550> the<00:01:27.700> t2<00:01:28.120> is<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.450> hybrid<00:01:28.810> pedal

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:29.260 
so as we said the t2 is a hybrid pedal

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.420 
so as we said the t2 is a hybrid pedal
so<00:01:29.409> the<00:01:29.500> knobs<00:01:29.680> are<00:01:29.890> maybe<00:01:30.250> a<00:01:30.370> little

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
so the knobs are maybe a little

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.430 
so the knobs are maybe a little
different<00:01:31.030> than<00:01:31.210> then<00:01:31.540> on<00:01:31.660> some<00:01:31.900> other<00:01:32.020> pedals

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
different than then on some other pedals

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.440 
different than then on some other pedals
let's<00:01:32.620> just<00:01:32.830> cover<00:01:33.280> them<00:01:33.460> real<00:01:33.610> quick<00:01:33.820> the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
let's just cover them real quick the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.300 
let's just cover them real quick the
effect<00:01:34.750> level<00:01:34.960> is<00:01:35.140> just<00:01:35.170> a<00:01:35.380> wet-dry<00:01:35.860> how<00:01:36.160> much

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
effect level is just a wet-dry how much

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.700 
effect level is just a wet-dry how much
affect<00:01:36.729> versus<00:01:37.150> how<00:01:37.300> much<00:01:37.450> non<00:01:38.380> affected

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:38.710 
affect versus how much non affected

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.820 
affect versus how much non affected
guitar<00:01:39.190> sound<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:40.570> tone<00:01:40.810> knob<00:01:41.050> is<00:01:41.320> just

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
guitar sound the tone knob is just

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.100 
guitar sound the tone knob is just
controls<00:01:42.430> where<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.820> filtering<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.570> Wow<00:01:43.750> high

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.110 
controls where the filtering is Wow high

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.060 
controls where the filtering is Wow high
or<00:01:44.350> how<00:01:44.500> low<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:45.580> feedback<00:01:46.060> is<00:01:46.300> how<00:01:46.780> long<00:01:47.170> the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 
or how low the feedback is how long the

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.510 
or how low the feedback is how long the
effect<00:01:48.460> goes<00:01:48.729> after<00:01:49.690> you<00:01:50.020> stop<00:01:50.259> playing<00:01:50.619> any

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
effect goes after you stop playing any

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.760 
effect goes after you stop playing any
individual<00:01:52.030> note<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.420> then<00:01:52.600> the<00:01:52.630> s<00:01:53.020> time<00:01:53.380> is

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
individual note and then the s time is

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.830 
individual note and then the s time is
the<00:01:54.100> spread<00:01:54.369> time<00:01:54.610> which<00:01:54.940> is<00:01:55.119> really<00:01:55.450> like<00:01:55.630> the

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
the spread time which is really like the

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.870 
the spread time which is really like the
delay<00:01:56.140> time<00:01:56.380> how<00:01:56.619> far<00:01:56.979> apart<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.460> repeating

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
delay time how far apart the repeating

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.180 
delay time how far apart the repeating
parts<00:01:58.180> are<00:01:58.330> in<00:01:58.450> the<00:01:58.539> effect<00:01:58.869> so<00:01:59.830> let's<00:01:59.860> hear<00:02:00.130> a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
parts are in the effect so let's hear a

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:11.720 
parts are in the effect so let's hear a
few<00:02:00.250> more<00:02:00.490> examples

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:18.170 

you

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:34.460 

Hey

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.740 

so<00:02:35.470> another<00:02:35.650> cool<00:02:35.950> feature<00:02:36.159> of<00:02:36.610> the<00:02:36.730> t2<00:02:37.239> is<00:02:37.540> its

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
so another cool feature of the t2 is its

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.589 
so another cool feature of the t2 is its
hold<00:02:38.049> or<00:02:38.379> freeze<00:02:38.829> function<00:02:39.129> which<00:02:40.000> allows<00:02:40.180> you

00:02:40.589 --> 00:02:40.599 
hold or freeze function which allows you

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.839 
hold or freeze function which allows you
to<00:02:40.810> hold<00:02:41.140> down<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.500> pedal<00:02:41.859> and<00:02:42.040> have<00:02:42.700> the

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
to hold down the pedal and have the

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.690 
to hold down the pedal and have the
effect<00:02:42.959> sustained<00:02:43.959> as<00:02:44.349> a<00:02:44.409> pad<00:02:44.859> for<00:02:45.310> as<00:02:45.370> long<00:02:45.549> as

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
effect sustained as a pad for as long as

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.460 
effect sustained as a pad for as long as
you<00:02:45.790> want<00:02:46.030> while<00:02:46.329> you're<00:02:46.480> able<00:02:46.720> to<00:02:46.750> play<00:02:47.019> over

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
you want while you're able to play over

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.259 
you want while you're able to play over
the<00:02:47.560> top<00:02:47.769> of<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:48.069> let's<00:02:48.760> hear<00:02:48.879> a<00:02:48.939> little<00:02:48.970> bit<00:02:49.180> of

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
the top of it let's hear a little bit of

00:02:49.269 --> 00:03:34.360 
the top of it let's hear a little bit of
that

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:37.250 

alright<00:03:35.370> that<00:03:35.700> has<00:03:35.849> been<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.150> boss<00:03:36.359> te<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:37.230> the

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
alright that has been the boss te to the
