this<00:00:05.609> one<00:00:05.790> we're<00:00:05.940> gonna<00:00:06.029> look<00:00:06.150> at<00:00:06.450> body

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
this one we're gonna look at body

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.890 
this one we're gonna look at body
paragraphs<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:08.059> more<00:00:09.059> specifically<00:00:09.599> how<00:00:09.870> to

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
paragraphs and more specifically how to

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.650 
paragraphs and more specifically how to
keep<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:11.580> words<00:00:11.820> coming<00:00:12.330> as<00:00:12.480> you're

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
keep the the words coming as you're

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.470 
keep the the words coming as you're
writing<00:00:12.870> your<00:00:13.139> body<00:00:13.349> paragraphs<00:00:14.040> because

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:14.480 
writing your body paragraphs because

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.210 
writing your body paragraphs because
oftentimes<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:16.379> is<00:00:16.619> where<00:00:16.830> writer's<00:00:17.190> block

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
oftentimes this is where writer's block

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.240 
oftentimes this is where writer's block
is<00:00:17.699> going<00:00:17.880> to<00:00:18.060> hit<00:00:18.240> you<00:00:18.480> the<00:00:18.630> most<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.410> I<00:00:19.980> found

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
is going to hit you the most and I found

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.460 
is going to hit you the most and I found
a<00:00:20.369> nice<00:00:20.490> little<00:00:20.520> three-step<00:00:21.420> process<00:00:21.689> you<00:00:22.230> can

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
a nice little three-step process you can

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.160 
a nice little three-step process you can
use<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:23.250> then<00:00:23.369> repeat<00:00:23.820> that<00:00:24.150> does<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> nice<00:00:25.140> job

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
use and then repeat that does a nice job

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.609 
use and then repeat that does a nice job
of<00:00:25.560> keeping<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:26.039> ball<00:00:26.220> rolling<00:00:27.349> and<00:00:28.349> there's

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
of keeping the ball rolling and there's

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.700 
of keeping the ball rolling and there's
three<00:00:28.890> steps<00:00:29.189> in<00:00:29.660> this<00:00:30.660> cycle<00:00:31.170> that<00:00:31.560> you're

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
three steps in this cycle that you're

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.340 
three steps in this cycle that you're
going<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> keep<00:00:32.130> using<00:00:32.600> the<00:00:33.600> first<00:00:33.870> part<00:00:34.170> is<00:00:34.320> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
going to keep using the first part is to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.720 
going to keep using the first part is to
propose<00:00:35.270> second<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.690> quote<00:00:36.960> and<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:38.460> third

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
propose second is to quote and the third

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:46.310 
propose second is to quote and the third
is<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.620> decode<00:00:41.360> so<00:00:42.440> first<00:00:43.440> and<00:00:44.390> foremost<00:00:45.390> is<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
is to decode so first and foremost is to

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.350 
is to decode so first and foremost is to
propose<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.489> means<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:48.180> make<00:00:48.329> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
propose and that just means to make a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.750 
propose and that just means to make a
claim<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.200> supports<00:00:49.739> your<00:00:49.890> thesis<00:00:50.129> in<00:00:50.520> some

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
claim that supports your thesis in some

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.069 
claim that supports your thesis in some
way<00:00:50.940> think<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.899> it<00:00:52.050> as<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.739> mini<00:00:53.010> thesis<00:00:53.960> just<00:00:54.960> a

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
way think of it as a mini thesis just a

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.950 
way think of it as a mini thesis just a
smaller<00:00:55.789> anecdote<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:56.820> proves<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.719> bigger

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
smaller anecdote that proves the bigger

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.790 
smaller anecdote that proves the bigger
point<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.739> your<00:00:58.920> thesis<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:01.410> second

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
point that is your thesis the second

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.670 
point that is your thesis the second
part<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.489> to<00:01:02.640> be<00:01:02.789> to<00:01:03.090> quote<00:01:03.690> which<00:01:04.320> means

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
part is going to be to quote which means

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.820 
part is going to be to quote which means
you<00:01:05.189> know<00:01:05.280> pretty<00:01:05.760> self-explanatory<00:01:06.799> use<00:01:07.799> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
you know pretty self-explanatory use a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.770 
you know pretty self-explanatory use a
quote<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:08.430> your<00:01:08.610> research<00:01:08.970> that<00:01:09.390> helps

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
quote from your research that helps

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.380 
quote from your research that helps
support<00:01:09.930> or<00:01:10.439> backup<00:01:10.979> what<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.520> proposed<00:01:12.030> in

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
support or backup what you proposed in

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.660 
support or backup what you proposed in
the<00:01:12.570> previous<00:01:13.020> step<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:14.070> doesn't<00:01:14.460> have<00:01:14.640> to

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the previous step this doesn't have to

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.670 
the previous step this doesn't have to
be<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.939> quote<00:01:15.240> you<00:01:15.390> could<00:01:15.600> just<00:01:15.810> paraphrase<00:01:16.439> or

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
be a quote you could just paraphrase or

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.149 
be a quote you could just paraphrase or
refer<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.040> something<00:01:17.930> but<00:01:18.930> usually<00:01:19.680> quoting

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
refer to something but usually quoting

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:21.950 
refer to something but usually quoting
is<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.460> best<00:01:20.670> way<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> go<00:01:21.090> about<00:01:21.330> doing<00:01:21.720> this

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
is the best way to go about doing this

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.100 
is the best way to go about doing this
and<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.740> fact<00:01:23.360> from<00:01:24.360> my<00:01:24.570> experience

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
and in fact from my experience

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.340 
and in fact from my experience
professors<00:01:26.119> often<00:01:27.119> say<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.540> students

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
professors often say that students

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.050 
professors often say that students
aren't<00:01:28.500> quoting<00:01:28.950> enough<00:01:29.250> they're<00:01:29.790> afraid

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
aren't quoting enough they're afraid

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.460 
aren't quoting enough they're afraid
that<00:01:30.180> they're<00:01:30.540> going<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:30.930> using<00:01:31.290> other

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
that they're going to be using other

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.679 
that they're going to be using other
people's<00:01:31.920> words<00:01:32.189> too<00:01:32.549> often<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.270> they<00:01:33.390> don't

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
people's words too often so they don't

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.319 
people's words too often so they don't
quote<00:01:34.009> so<00:01:35.009> don't<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:36.000> know<00:01:36.090> don't<00:01:36.299> be

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
quote so don't I you know don't be

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.240 
quote so don't I you know don't be
afraid<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.869> quote<00:01:37.110> it's<00:01:37.409> it's<00:01:37.770> better<00:01:37.979> to<00:01:38.130> do

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
afraid to quote it's it's better to do

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.160 
afraid to quote it's it's better to do
it<00:01:38.400> more<00:01:38.880> than<00:01:39.119> less<00:01:39.329> honestly<00:01:40.670> and<00:01:42.170> then

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
it more than less honestly and then

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.819 
it more than less honestly and then
finally<00:01:43.710> after<00:01:43.950> quoting<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.790> want<00:01:45.000> to<00:01:45.180> decode

00:01:45.819 --> 00:01:45.829 
finally after quoting you want to decode

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.010 
finally after quoting you want to decode
and<00:01:46.829> this<00:01:47.460> is<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.790> step<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.270> most<00:01:48.600> people

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and this is the step that most people

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.370 
and this is the step that most people
miss<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> research<00:01:50.460> writing<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.079> it<00:01:52.079> hurts

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
miss in a research writing and it hurts

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.620 
miss in a research writing and it hurts
them<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:52.799> most<00:01:53.100> when<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.640> comes<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.270> final

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
them the most when it comes to the final

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.520 
them the most when it comes to the final
grade<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:56.030> decoding<00:01:57.030> basically<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:58.290> means

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
grade and decoding basically just means

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.380 
grade and decoding basically just means
to<00:01:58.710> assume<00:01:59.009> your<00:01:59.189> writer<00:01:59.430> doesn't<00:01:59.850> get<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
to assume your writer doesn't get the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.810 
to assume your writer doesn't get the
connection<00:02:01.020> between<00:02:01.380> your<00:02:01.979> proposal<00:02:02.610> and

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
connection between your proposal and

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.880 
connection between your proposal and
your<00:02:02.969> quote<00:02:03.290> so<00:02:04.290> what<00:02:04.409> you're<00:02:04.530> going<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.680> do

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
your quote so what you're going to do

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.389 
your quote so what you're going to do
here<00:02:05.219> is<00:02:06.110> draw<00:02:07.110> the<00:02:07.170> connection<00:02:07.829> between<00:02:08.009> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
here is draw the connection between the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.940 
here is draw the connection between the
proposal<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.239> quotes<00:02:09.569> specifically<00:02:10.379> so

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
proposal and the quotes specifically so

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.619 
proposal and the quotes specifically so
you<00:02:11.039> get<00:02:11.340> back<00:02:11.520> to<00:02:11.700> your<00:02:11.819> own<00:02:11.940> words<00:02:12.180> again<00:02:12.599> and

00:02:12.619 --> 00:02:12.629 
you get back to your own words again and

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:13.180 
you get back to your own words again and
you

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
you

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.280 
you
exactly<00:02:13.910> why<00:02:14.120> that<00:02:14.150> quote<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:14.960> helping

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
exactly why that quote is helping

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.250 
exactly why that quote is helping
support<00:02:16.100> your<00:02:16.340> proposal<00:02:16.550> or<00:02:17.270> why<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:17.960> makes

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
support your proposal or why it makes

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.430 
support your proposal or why it makes
her<00:02:18.410> proposal<00:02:18.830> valid<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:19.760> lot<00:02:20.540> of<00:02:20.690> people<00:02:21.050> when

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
her proposal valid a lot of people when

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.930 
her proposal valid a lot of people when
they're<00:02:21.590> writing<00:02:21.830> just<00:02:22.130> make<00:02:22.460> a<00:02:22.490> claim<00:02:22.910> and

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
they're writing just make a claim and

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.320 
they're writing just make a claim and
then<00:02:23.360> support<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.050> and<00:02:24.290> they<00:02:25.040> think<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.640> the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
then support it and they think that the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.300 
then support it and they think that the
reader<00:02:26.600> automatically<00:02:27.350> understands<00:02:28.160> the

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
reader automatically understands the

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:29.800 
reader automatically understands the
connection<00:02:28.580> between<00:02:28.940> those<00:02:29.300> two<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.720> it's

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
connection between those two and it's

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.020 
connection between those two and it's
not<00:02:30.140> always<00:02:30.410> obvious<00:02:30.800> the<00:02:31.580> writer<00:02:31.790> doesn't

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
not always obvious the writer doesn't

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.090 
not always obvious the writer doesn't
always<00:02:32.210> make<00:02:32.510> it<00:02:32.660> obvious<00:02:32.780> so<00:02:33.680> make<00:02:33.890> sure<00:02:33.920> that

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
always make it obvious so make sure that

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.310 
always make it obvious so make sure that
you're<00:02:34.400> bridging<00:02:34.640> that<00:02:34.850> connection<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.780> then

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
you're bridging that connection and then

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:38.950 
you're bridging that connection and then
you<00:02:36.350> can<00:02:36.770> start<00:02:37.100> over<00:02:37.310> again<00:02:37.730> you<00:02:38.360> can<00:02:38.540> propose

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:38.960 
you can start over again you can propose

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.250 
you can start over again you can propose
quote<00:02:39.350> into<00:02:39.620> code<00:02:39.910> in<00:02:40.910> some<00:02:41.210> cases<00:02:41.450> you<00:02:42.080> might

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
quote into code in some cases you might

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:45.580 
quote into code in some cases you might
propose<00:02:43.040> quote<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.940> code<00:02:44.180> then<00:02:45.050> quote<00:02:45.410> into

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
propose quote to code then quote into

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.320 
propose quote to code then quote into
code<00:02:45.890> again<00:02:46.160> if<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.460> really<00:02:46.700> want<00:02:46.850> to<00:02:46.940> hit<00:02:47.150> a

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330 
code again if you really want to hit a

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.320 
code again if you really want to hit a
proposal<00:02:47.840> home<00:02:48.260> you<00:02:48.980> might<00:02:49.130> use<00:02:49.370> two<00:02:49.820> sources

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
proposal home you might use two sources

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.570 
proposal home you might use two sources
and<00:02:50.960> decode<00:02:51.260> them<00:02:51.410> both<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.980> make<00:02:52.100> your<00:02:52.310> point

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
and decode them both to make your point

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.580 
and decode them both to make your point
but<00:02:53.210> otherwise<00:02:53.450> this<00:02:53.900> is<00:02:54.080> just<00:02:54.260> going<00:02:54.380> to<00:02:54.440> be<00:02:54.560> a

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
but otherwise this is just going to be a

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.590 
but otherwise this is just going to be a
good<00:02:54.770> three-step<00:02:55.340> process<00:02:55.580> for<00:02:56.240> writing<00:02:56.360> a

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
good three-step process for writing a

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.110 
good three-step process for writing a
paragraph<00:02:56.930> and<00:02:57.440> then<00:02:57.740> of<00:02:57.860> course<00:02:58.120> transition

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
paragraph and then of course transition

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.750 
paragraph and then of course transition
to<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.360> next<00:02:59.600> paragraph<00:02:59.810> after<00:03:00.230> this

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
to the next paragraph after this

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.600 
to the next paragraph after this
three-step<00:03:01.760> process<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:03.560> thanks<00:03:03.980> again<00:03:04.100> and

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610 
three-step process so thanks again and

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
three-step process so thanks again and
good<00:03:05.510> luck<00:03:05.720> writing<00:03:06.260> to<00:03:06.470> you
