00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.750
 hello how are you I hope that very well 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.270
 I would like to know this time how is 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:09.219
 training your arms yes because there are 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:12.160
 many people who train all the 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:13.059
 body and arms leave them beside 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.249
 another routine 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:18.040
 what do I mean with this there are people 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:20.140
 who devote whole days to doing arms 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.060
 be it my explicitly kind of other 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.220
 people who do it for that reason not with 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.050
 combining it with the back like this which 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.450
 it's fine it 's correct but they have 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.530
 correct but I want to know exactly 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.450
 like to know and have knowledge 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:33.280
 put you as behind you see that 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:36.100
 you are inside the foundation they want 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.600
 know if you train combining it or alone or 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.640
 isolating it just by training a 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.249
 arm sun if I wanted to know this because 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.140
 it is very important and if you have not noticed 

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:46.600
 if you train for example one day arms 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.069
 let's say triceps biceps the other day not 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.630
 you can train another exercise that 

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:53.070
 it involves the 2000 it sad me 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.410
 then you can not train 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.900
 my back because of the joint 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.610
 of the shoulder we will work more in this 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.690
 movement 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.030
 we are working the biceps too 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.530
 but about what you know 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.360
 what are you doing dominated too 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.880
 they are making funds they also work 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.189
 sad 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.860
 consequently you have to pay a lot 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.689
 attention on the subject if we make arms a 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.180
 day and we felt that the grass grew us 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:20.479
 the maximum that we say next a 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.969
 really perfect change but after 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.250
 rest the appropriate days after the 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:27.710
 subsequent days forget the fourth 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.850
 mobilization because I know what it is that avoids 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.479
 that the muscle keeps growing 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:37.080
 between the legs and abs between 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.320
 nothing because the trapezoids between 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.150
 forearms if you want calves but 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.299
 do not train other groups you can not 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.729
 involve the arms if you do not go to 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.549
 Take advantage of your mobile logo that gives 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.350
 take place or the worst that can happen to 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.690
 weaken the arms to say it 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.950
 somehow if instead of enlarging the 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.720
 girls sheet because keys to 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.000
 hypertrophy happens when we get up 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.240
 large amounts of weight with few 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.069
 repetitions if instead they ascend self 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.600
 two days the arm logically is not going to 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:10.729
 grow there are many people who think 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:13.940
 what else is better inside they achieve is not like that 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:16.300
 the arms are small muscles and the 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.250
 Arms links are small 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.840
 let's say the sad one is the biggest 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.700
 because it is composed of three heads 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.260
 3 hours 1 2 3 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.120
 of all the muscles that have you 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.780
 they name the most important and all 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.480
 we know of 47 handled terms 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.200
 non-scientific generals to avoid 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.120
 confusions and so that we can understand 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.470
 everything is simpler but never fails 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.380
 a person to leave a comment 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.720
 he was explained to him so he understands the 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:45.200
 biceps more than anything is something a function 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.670
 a little aesthetic let's say but already all the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.410
 world seeks to have vision then 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.150
 we also train with care 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.500
 must leave an example because logically 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.390
 everyone will want to know good then 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.220
 to understand that you do not come a day later 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.810
 among the marginalized 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:01.500
 if you are from the people who train 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.720
 Vicente and sad in the first days of 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.320
 the week is Monday or Tuesday leaves 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:11.120
 at least 3 to 4 days without training 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.120
 arms will seem exaggerated 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:18.250
 if not, it's not worth it alone 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.790
 you train arms nourish legs other 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.610
 abdominal day another day trapeze and other 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.220
 day before arm forearm not arm 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:27.990
 whole 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.600
 logically the top of the 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:33.420
 forearm if you do not train it in the way 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.190
 what we do in this way to this one 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.130
 way they were taught in several 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.130
 videos and the bottom part in back 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:46.120
 giving back face material 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.890
 the best breeding already knows the routines 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.080
 I have many leg routines. 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.610
 routines also for the calves of 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.480
 people who tell them there are people who 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.190
 they told me they could not do the 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.020
 calf followed my videos me 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.730
 grateful saying that it was very good 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.470
 which I feel very happy to be able to 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.870
 help them 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:05.640
 then if you are going to combine also if 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.140
 you are going to train back and biceps 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.430
 and which is correct because there 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.440
 people who usually in 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:15.270
 gyms in electoral opinion vice 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.400
 it's very bad today we train look 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.400
 through this movement we deliver 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.470
 the pectoral slightly shoulder the part 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.940
 from ahead and at the same time the 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.620
 sad because we are talking about three 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.270
 muscle groups and then you have to do 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.770
 its three groups link is that it turns out 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.220
 that our teacher 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.630
 indicates the next day work is father 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.160
 then it is wrong 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.280
 of those who only know how to take their 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.400
 conclusions 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.080
 in short there are we read the loops there is no 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:45.280
 nothing better for bodybuilding there is no 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.830
 nothing better for the people you want 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.230
 change your physique that isolate grifols 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.930
 in large the rest are useful among 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:54.960
 the back breaks does not involve any 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.180
 muscle tournaments 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.680
 here any question as always 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.819
 I say comment box is happy 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.819
 so thank you for waiting
