00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
wintertime in the Windy City we look for

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.059 
wintertime in the Windy City we look for
productive<00:00:07.080> things<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.379> do<00:00:07.500> rather<00:00:07.680> than<00:00:07.770> sit

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
productive things to do rather than sit

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:09.470 
productive things to do rather than sit
on<00:00:08.160> the<00:00:08.250> couch<00:00:08.429> and<00:00:08.730> one<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:08.970> those<00:00:09.059> things<00:00:09.269> is

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
on the couch and one of those things is

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.299 
on the couch and one of those things is
work<00:00:09.660> on<00:00:09.780> your<00:00:09.960> race<00:00:10.080> car<00:00:10.290> you<00:00:10.950> may<00:00:11.070> remember

work on your race car you may remember

work on your race car you may remember
our<00:00:11.429> 72<00:00:11.880> Camaro<00:00:12.240> from<00:00:12.360> previous<00:00:12.750> shows<00:00:12.840> that

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
our 72 Camaro from previous shows that

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.629 
our 72 Camaro from previous shows that
we've<00:00:13.440> had<00:00:13.650> when<00:00:13.830> we<00:00:13.860> were<00:00:14.009> at<00:00:14.130> the<00:00:14.219> track<00:00:14.429> with

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
we've had when we were at the track with

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:14.900 
we've had when we were at the track with
it

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
it

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.120 
it
we<00:00:15.269> ran<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.450> 12-11<00:00:15.839> with<00:00:16.199> this<00:00:16.350> car<00:00:16.560> we<00:00:17.070> were

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
we ran a 12-11 with this car we were

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.050 
we ran a 12-11 with this car we were
looking<00:00:17.400> for<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.550> way<00:00:17.640> to<00:00:17.670> make<00:00:17.850> it<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:18.000> little

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
looking for a way to make it a little

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.090 
looking for a way to make it a little
faster<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.960> think<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.650> best<00:00:19.800> way<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.010> to

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
faster and I think the best way is to

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.830 
faster and I think the best way is to
stick<00:00:20.279> a<00:00:20.310> nitrous<00:00:20.640> system<00:00:20.910> on<00:00:21.029> it<00:00:21.119> it's<00:00:21.359> a<00:00:21.449> 72

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
stick a nitrous system on it it's a 72

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.170 
stick a nitrous system on it it's a 72
Camaro<00:00:22.230> that's<00:00:22.529> just<00:00:23.340> been<00:00:23.640> flogged<00:00:23.939> down<00:00:24.150> a

Camaro that's just been flogged down a
little<00:00:24.390> bit<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.689> track<00:00:24.930> that<00:00:25.109> one<00:00:25.260> day<00:00:25.410> it's

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
little bit the track that one day it's

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.880 
little bit the track that one day it's
got<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:26.460> 454<00:00:27.240> oval<00:00:27.810> more<00:00:28.019> motor<00:00:28.289> than<00:00:28.380> fast<00:00:28.710> I'm

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
got a 454 oval more motor than fast I'm

got a 454 oval more motor than fast I'm
finna<00:00:29.130> to<00:00:29.279> pump<00:00:29.550> can't<00:00:29.789> see

real streetable engine the the engines

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.670 
real streetable engine the the engines
like<00:00:34.510> this<00:00:34.690> where<00:00:34.899> you<00:00:34.960> don't<00:00:35.110> spend<00:00:35.379> a<00:00:35.500> lot<00:00:35.649> of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:35.680 
like this where you don't spend a lot of

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:37.680 
like this where you don't spend a lot of
money<00:00:35.829> to<00:00:36.040> make<00:00:36.160> them<00:00:36.280> go<00:00:36.399> fast<00:00:36.700> really<00:00:37.329> seem

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
money to make them go fast really seem

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:39.060 
money to make them go fast really seem
to<00:00:37.720> wake<00:00:37.960> up<00:00:38.140> when<00:00:38.350> you<00:00:38.379> put<00:00:38.559> on<00:00:38.649> a<00:00:38.680> nitrous

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
to wake up when you put on a nitrous

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.160 
to wake up when you put on a nitrous
system<00:00:39.430> so<00:00:39.940> we<00:00:40.629> couldn't<00:00:40.809> think<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:41.079> a<00:00:41.140> better

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
system so we couldn't think of a better

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.680 
system so we couldn't think of a better
candidate<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.829> stick<00:00:42.010> this<00:00:42.129> system<00:00:42.430> on<00:00:42.690> well

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
candidate to stick this system on well

complete kit but the thing I like best

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.090 
complete kit but the thing I like best
about<00:01:09.939> it<00:01:10.119> is<00:01:10.330> is<00:01:11.020> this<00:01:11.170> bolt<00:01:11.439> together<00:01:11.560> plate

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.100 
about it is is this bolt together plate

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.990 
about it is is this bolt together plate
it's<00:01:13.030> an<00:01:13.150> amazing<00:01:13.750> piece<00:01:14.020> I<00:01:14.290> mean<00:01:15.040> things<00:01:15.729> like

it's an amazing piece I mean things like

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.270 
it's an amazing piece I mean things like
the<00:01:16.390> the<00:01:16.600> perimeter<00:01:17.020> design<00:01:17.350> means<00:01:17.920> that<00:01:18.159> the

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
the the perimeter design means that the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.620 
the the perimeter design means that the
fuel<00:01:18.580> and<00:01:18.759> the<00:01:18.850> nitrous<00:01:19.150> instead<00:01:19.479> of<00:01:19.570> it

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
fuel and the nitrous instead of it

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.450 
fuel and the nitrous instead of it
coming<00:01:19.780> out<00:01:19.930> of<00:01:20.049> spray<00:01:20.380> bars<00:01:20.650> is<00:01:20.890> actually

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
coming out of spray bars is actually

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.340 
coming out of spray bars is actually
coming<00:01:21.759> out<00:01:21.820> around<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.299> outside<00:01:22.750> edge<00:01:23.020> of

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
coming out around the outside edge of

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.690 
coming out around the outside edge of
the<00:01:23.470> plate<00:01:23.710> it's<00:01:24.070> amazing<00:01:24.700> for<00:01:24.729> distribution

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the plate it's amazing for distribution

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.280 
the plate it's amazing for distribution
now<00:01:27.700> you<00:01:28.180> can<00:01:28.330> install<00:01:28.540> a<00:01:28.659> nitrous<00:01:29.020> system

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:29.290 
now you can install a nitrous system

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
now you can install a nitrous system
basically<00:01:29.530> what<00:01:29.710> the<00:01:29.799> parts<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:30.130> are

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
basically what the parts that are

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.700 
basically what the parts that are
supplied<00:01:30.610> in<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.759> kit<00:01:30.850> but<00:01:31.240> we<00:01:31.420> chose<00:01:31.659> to<00:01:31.900> do<00:01:32.680> a

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:32.710 
supplied in the kit but we chose to do a

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.160 
supplied in the kit but we chose to do a
little<00:01:32.860> more<00:01:33.130> we<00:01:33.400> we've<00:01:33.670> got<00:01:33.909> things<00:01:34.630> like<00:01:34.869> we

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
little more we we've got things like we

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.980 
little more we we've got things like we
wanted<00:01:35.380> to<00:01:35.440> upgrade<00:01:35.710> the<00:01:35.830> fuel<00:01:36.040> system<00:01:36.990> also

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
wanted to upgrade the fuel system also

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:39.870 
wanted to upgrade the fuel system also
for<00:01:38.440> mounting<00:01:38.830> the<00:01:38.950> nitrous<00:01:39.220> line<00:01:39.370> safely

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:39.880 
for mounting the nitrous line safely

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.280 
for mounting the nitrous line safely
underneath<00:01:40.150> the<00:01:40.240> car<00:01:40.420> we<00:01:40.570> bought<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:40.960> package

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
underneath the car we bought a package

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:43.020 
underneath the car we bought a package
of<00:01:41.409> adult<00:01:41.650> clamps<00:01:42.040> adult<00:01:42.490> clamps<00:01:42.760> are<00:01:42.880> nice

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
of adult clamps adult clamps are nice

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.730 
of adult clamps adult clamps are nice
because<00:01:43.300> they're<00:01:43.600> metal<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.140> they<00:01:44.440> wouldn't

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
because they're metal and they wouldn't

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.920 
because they're metal and they wouldn't
melt<00:01:44.950> and<00:01:45.190> they're<00:01:45.520> easy<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.760> attach<00:01:46.120> a<00:01:46.390> line

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
melt and they're easy to attach a line

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.840 
melt and they're easy to attach a line
inside<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.409> car<00:01:47.590> and<00:01:47.740> then<00:01:48.159> Earl<00:01:48.310> supplied<00:01:48.729> us

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
inside the car and then Earl supplied us

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.570 
inside the car and then Earl supplied us
with<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:49.030> bunch<00:01:49.210> of<00:01:49.330> fittings<00:01:50.260> to<00:01:50.800> do<00:01:51.130> our<00:01:51.280> fuel

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
with a bunch of fittings to do our fuel

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.730 
with a bunch of fittings to do our fuel
system<00:01:52.000> properly<00:01:55.110> at<00:01:56.110> this<00:01:56.350> point<00:01:56.590> we're

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
system properly at this point we're

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.200 
system properly at this point we're
going<00:01:56.770> to<00:01:56.890> mount<00:01:57.040> the<00:01:57.250> regulator<00:01:57.729> off<00:01:57.940> of<00:01:58.090> our

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
going to mount the regulator off of our

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.480 
going to mount the regulator off of our
carburetor<00:01:58.750> I<00:01:58.960> find<00:01:59.260> that<00:01:59.350> the<00:01:59.530> cleanest<00:02:00.340> way

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
carburetor I find that the cleanest way

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.460 
carburetor I find that the cleanest way
the<00:02:00.640> most<00:02:00.760> sanitary<00:02:01.030> way<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.510> do<00:02:01.720> it<00:02:01.840> is<00:02:02.290> to

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:02.470 
the most sanitary way to do it is to

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.930 
the most sanitary way to do it is to
start<00:02:02.650> out<00:02:02.770> with<00:02:02.860> some<00:02:03.040> stainless<00:02:03.400> steel<00:02:03.580> 3/8

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
start out with some stainless steel 3/8

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.740 
start out with some stainless steel 3/8
tubing<00:02:05.190> what<00:02:06.190> you<00:02:06.280> do<00:02:06.430> is<00:02:06.549> you<00:02:06.670> bend<00:02:06.940> the

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
tubing what you do is you bend the

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.589 
tubing what you do is you bend the
tubing<00:02:08.170> to<00:02:08.349> fit<00:02:09.099> into<00:02:09.369> your<00:02:09.729> regulator<00:02:10.299> this

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
tubing to fit into your regulator this

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.930 
tubing to fit into your regulator this
is<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.899> holley<00:02:11.080> regulator<00:02:11.680> when<00:02:12.459> all<00:02:12.580> said

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
is the holley regulator when all said

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.220 
is the holley regulator when all said
and<00:02:13.060> done<00:02:13.120> by<00:02:13.569> the<00:02:13.629> tip<00:02:13.900> when<00:02:14.019> you're<00:02:14.140> done

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
and done by the tip when you're done

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.089

any holes make sure you're not drilling
into<00:03:20.379> something<00:03:20.739> like<00:03:20.950> your<00:03:21.129> gas<00:03:21.250> tank<00:03:21.310> so

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:26.189 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:28.289 

what<00:03:27.189> sucked<00:03:27.459> if<00:03:27.579> I<00:03:27.669> drilled<00:03:27.909> right<00:03:28.030> into<00:03:28.209> the

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
what sucked if I drilled right into the

plate<00:03:39.849> system<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:41.290> way<00:03:41.409> it<00:03:41.500> works<00:03:41.680> is<00:03:42.120> the

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:43.120 
plate system the way it works is the

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.300 
plate system the way it works is the
nitrous<00:03:43.419> oxide<00:03:43.810> obviously<00:03:44.290> comes<00:03:45.099> to<00:03:45.219> the

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
nitrous oxide obviously comes to the

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.069 
nitrous oxide obviously comes to the
front<00:03:45.519> of<00:03:45.579> the<00:03:45.639> solenoid<00:03:45.879> when<00:03:46.599> it<00:03:46.719> leaves<00:03:46.930> the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
solenoid it comes out and goes into the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.780 
solenoid it comes out and goes into the
nitrous<00:03:49.479> plate<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:50.859> fuel<00:03:51.129> solenoid<00:03:51.400> does<00:03:51.699> the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
nitrous plate the fuel solenoid does the

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.539 
nitrous plate the fuel solenoid does the
same<00:03:52.000> thing<00:03:52.269> now<00:03:52.900> if<00:03:53.019> you<00:03:53.109> notice<00:03:53.530> our<00:03:53.709> one

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
same thing now if you notice our one

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.789

that<00:03:58.629> on<00:03:58.750> purpose<00:03:58.780> I<00:03:59.379> found<00:03:59.949> that<00:04:00.159> the<00:04:00.759> nitrous

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090 
that on purpose I found that the nitrous

applied<00:04:17.229> to<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.530> solenoids<00:04:18.039> what<00:04:18.699> it<00:04:18.820> does<00:04:19.000> is

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
applied to the solenoids what it does is

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.420 
applied to the solenoids what it does is
it<00:04:19.419> comes<00:04:19.989> out<00:04:20.289> of<00:04:20.349> the<00:04:20.560> solenoids<00:04:20.979> and<00:04:21.159> then

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
it comes out of the solenoids and then

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.580 
it comes out of the solenoids and then
basically<00:04:21.940> comes<00:04:22.360> out<00:04:22.539> of<00:04:22.870> these<00:04:23.020> holes

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
basically comes out of these holes

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.529 
basically comes out of these holes
around<00:04:23.919> the<00:04:24.159> perimeter<00:04:24.610> of<00:04:24.639> the<00:04:24.820> plate<00:04:25.060> going

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:25.539 
around the perimeter of the plate going

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.540 
around the perimeter of the plate going

do is plug in the wires for the

00:05:56.030 --> 00:06:00.370 
do is plug in the wires for the
activation<00:05:56.390> switch<00:05:56.840> like<00:05:57.650> that<00:05:58.480> and<00:05:59.480> the<00:06:00.260> way

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
activation switch like that and the way

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.730 
activation switch like that and the way
this<00:06:01.120> switch<00:06:02.120> works<00:06:02.390> is<00:06:02.630> when<00:06:03.620> the

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:03.740 
this switch works is when the

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.370 
this switch works is when the
secondaries<00:06:04.400> are<00:06:04.670> fully<00:06:04.970> open<00:06:05.060> you'll<00:06:06.050> notice

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
secondaries are fully open you'll notice

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.590 
secondaries are fully open you'll notice
it<00:06:06.860> hits<00:06:07.130> the<00:06:07.280> switch<00:06:07.460> and<00:06:08.000> the<00:06:08.090> nitrous<00:06:08.360> is<00:06:08.480> to

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
it hits the switch and the nitrous is to

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.580 
it hits the switch and the nitrous is to
mine<00:06:09.670> and<00:06:10.670> that<00:06:10.790> would<00:06:10.880> turn<00:06:11.030> on<00:06:11.120> the<00:06:11.210> system

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
mine and that would turn on the system

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.790 
mine and that would turn on the system
pretty<00:06:12.590> cool<00:06:13.600> ok<00:06:14.600> the<00:06:15.110> last<00:06:15.140> thing<00:06:15.560> that<00:06:15.590> we
