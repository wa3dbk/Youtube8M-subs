00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
the more pieces you capture the more

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.110 
the more pieces you capture the more

merit changing the game to suit a

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.930 
merit changing the game to suit a
beginners<00:03:07.810> weakness<00:03:08.489> and<00:03:09.489> that's<00:03:09.670> what<00:03:09.850> it

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
beginners weakness and that's what it

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.190 
beginners weakness and that's what it
did<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.270> I<00:03:10.390> think<00:03:10.450> that's<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.870> really<00:03:11.080> good

did and I think that's a really good
point<00:03:11.610> you<00:03:13.140> don't<00:03:14.140> want<00:03:14.410> to<00:03:14.530> make<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:15.640> base

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
point you don't want to make the base

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:17.520

manufacturer<00:04:17.810> try<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.019> make<00:04:18.199> it<00:04:18.350> blue<00:04:18.709> which<00:04:18.979> I

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
manufacturer try to make it blue which I

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.610 
manufacturer try to make it blue which I
thought<00:04:19.729> was<00:04:19.880> really<00:04:19.940> cool<00:04:20.299> but<00:04:21.139> I'll<00:04:21.320> just<00:04:21.350> go

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:21.620 
thought was really cool but I'll just go

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.060 
thought was really cool but I'll just go
ahead<00:04:21.680> and<00:04:21.829> call<00:04:21.919> them<00:04:22.009> white<00:04:22.220> and<00:04:22.660> these<00:04:24.070> so

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
ahead and call them white and these so

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:26.469 
ahead and call them white and these so
this<00:04:25.220> side<00:04:25.400> does<00:04:25.550> not<00:04:25.699> have<00:04:25.850> the<00:04:25.970> king<00:04:26.180> only

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
this side does not have the king only

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:27.909 
this side does not have the king only
this<00:04:26.690> side<00:04:26.900> so<00:04:27.080> there's<00:04:27.259> the<00:04:27.410> king<00:04:27.560> that's<00:04:27.740> one

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
this side so there's the king that's one

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.219 
this side so there's the king that's one
piece<00:04:28.100> the<00:04:28.340> second<00:04:28.639> piece<00:04:28.789> is<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:29.180> King's<00:04:29.419> Men

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:30.229 
piece the second piece is the King's Men

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:36.610 
piece the second piece is the King's Men
I<00:04:30.680> call<00:04:31.220> these<00:04:31.370> pawns<00:04:31.610> and<00:04:35.110> then<00:04:36.110> you<00:04:36.259> have<00:04:36.470> the

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
I call these pawns and then you have the

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.430 
I call these pawns and then you have the
third<00:04:36.830> piece<00:04:37.039> which<00:04:37.160> is<00:04:37.280> black<00:04:37.789> pawn<00:04:39.669> and<00:04:41.440> so

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
third piece which is black pawn and so

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.570 
third piece which is black pawn and so
now<00:04:42.590> we're<00:04:42.680> going<00:04:42.770> to<00:04:42.860> go<00:04:42.949> over<00:04:42.979> rules<00:04:43.340> there's

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
now we're going to go over rules there's

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.040 
now we're going to go over rules there's
really<00:04:43.880> all<00:04:44.120> the<00:04:44.270> rules<00:04:44.449> of<00:04:44.570> the<00:04:44.630> game<00:04:44.870> can

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.050 
really all the rules of the game can

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.469 
really all the rules of the game can
kind<00:04:45.259> of<00:04:45.349> be<00:04:45.669> condensed<00:04:46.669> down<00:04:46.699> to<00:04:47.030> six

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 
kind of be condensed down to six

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.300 
kind of be condensed down to six
basically<00:04:48.289> the<00:04:48.530> first<00:04:48.680> rule<00:04:48.949> is<00:04:48.979> how<00:04:49.250> the

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
basically the first rule is how the

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:52.510 
basically the first rule is how the
pieces<00:04:49.699> move<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:51.020> pieces<00:04:51.410> move<00:04:51.620> like<00:04:52.130> rooks

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
pieces move the pieces move like rooks

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.300 
pieces move the pieces move like rooks
in<00:04:52.789> chess<00:04:53.630> is<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.590> term<00:04:54.800> you'll<00:04:54.949> hear<00:04:54.979> and

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
in chess is the term you'll hear and

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.770 
in chess is the term you'll hear and
that's<00:04:55.490> where<00:04:55.759> let's<00:04:56.150> say<00:04:56.210> it's<00:04:56.419> this<00:04:56.539> piece

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
that's where let's say it's this piece

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.339 
that's where let's say it's this piece
here<00:04:57.229> he's<00:04:58.160> gonna<00:04:58.310> move<00:04:58.750> you<00:04:59.750> can<00:04:59.930> move<00:05:00.050> all

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
here he's gonna move you can move all

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.620 
here he's gonna move you can move all
the<00:05:00.380> way<00:05:00.470> to<00:05:00.650> there<00:05:01.030> you<00:05:02.030> can<00:05:02.150> move<00:05:02.270> from<00:05:02.360> here

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
the way to there you can move from here

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:04.210 
the way to there you can move from here
to<00:05:02.870> here<00:05:03.139> or<00:05:03.169> you<00:05:03.349> can<00:05:03.470> move<00:05:03.620> from<00:05:03.710> here<00:05:03.889> to

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
to here or you can move from here to

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:14.830 
to here or you can move from here to
here<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:08.650> this<00:05:09.650> way<00:05:10.659> this<00:05:11.659> way<00:05:13.120> and<00:05:14.120> they<00:05:14.659> call

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
here and this way this way and they call

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.520 
here and this way this way and they call
that<00:05:14.870> orthogonal<00:05:15.650> movement<00:05:16.130> and<00:05:17.289> as<00:05:18.289> long<00:05:18.500> as

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
that orthogonal movement and as long as

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.710 
that orthogonal movement and as long as
the<00:05:18.770> path<00:05:18.979> is<00:05:19.190> unimpeded<00:05:19.849> he<00:05:20.120> can<00:05:20.240> move<00:05:20.389> as<00:05:20.510> far

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 
the path is unimpeded he can move as far

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.420 
the path is unimpeded he can move as far
you<00:05:21.020> know<00:05:21.110> so<00:05:21.289> he's<00:05:21.440> impeded<00:05:21.860> here<00:05:22.070> so<00:05:22.220> he<00:05:22.310> has

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:22.430 
you know so he's impeded here so he has

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:23.800 
you know so he's impeded here so he has
to<00:05:22.550> stop<00:05:22.760> there<00:05:23.000> but<00:05:23.180> if<00:05:23.270> this<00:05:23.389> piece<00:05:23.570> wasn't

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:23.810 
to stop there but if this piece wasn't

00:05:23.810 --> 00:05:26.200 
to stop there but if this piece wasn't
here<00:05:24.260> you<00:05:25.070> can<00:05:25.250> move<00:05:25.370> the<00:05:25.550> whole<00:05:25.669> length<00:05:25.970> up

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
here you can move the whole length up

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.969 
here you can move the whole length up
until<00:05:26.510> he<00:05:26.810> reaches<00:05:27.080> that<00:05:27.110> piece<00:05:27.409> there<00:05:29.979> okay

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:30.979 
until he reaches that piece there okay

00:05:30.979 --> 00:05:35.200 
until he reaches that piece there okay
and<00:05:32.349> you<00:05:33.349> can't<00:05:33.620> jump<00:05:34.000> that's<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.090> other

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:35.210 
and you can't jump that's the other

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.240 
and you can't jump that's the other
thing<00:05:35.300> so<00:05:35.750> they<00:05:35.870> fees<00:05:36.050> here<00:05:36.380> you<00:05:36.500> can't<00:05:36.740> jump

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:37.250 
thing so they fees here you can't jump

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:39.060 
thing so they fees here you can't jump
on<00:05:37.400> the<00:05:37.490> next<00:05:37.610> maneuver<00:05:37.940> something<00:05:38.270> like<00:05:38.419> that

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.070 
on the next maneuver something like that

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.399 
on the next maneuver something like that
and<00:05:40.070> also<00:05:41.060> there's<00:05:41.240> no<00:05:41.300> diagonal<00:05:41.870> movement<00:05:42.080> so

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:42.409 
and also there's no diagonal movement so

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:50.230 
and also there's no diagonal movement so
if<00:05:42.470> he's<00:05:42.590> here<00:05:43.630> this<00:05:44.630> way

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.320 

the<00:05:50.810> second<00:05:51.319> rule<00:05:51.500> is<00:05:51.800> all<00:05:52.310> about<00:05:52.759> how<00:05:53.030> to<00:05:53.090> win

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
the second rule is all about how to win

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.550 
the second rule is all about how to win
the<00:05:53.479> game<00:05:53.660> and<00:05:54.789> the<00:05:55.789> kingside<00:05:56.780> wins

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:57.560 
the game and the kingside wins

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.540 
the game and the kingside wins
whenever<00:05:57.979> the<00:05:58.220> King<00:05:58.509> reaches<00:05:59.509> any<00:06:00.220> square<00:06:01.220> on

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:01.550 
whenever the King reaches any square on

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:05.830 
whenever the King reaches any square on
the<00:06:02.030> periphery<00:06:02.660> of<00:06:02.690> the<00:06:02.810> board<00:06:03.639> so<00:06:04.720> when<00:06:05.720> he's

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
the periphery of the board so when he's

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.420 
the periphery of the board so when he's
here<00:06:06.020> he<00:06:06.259> right<00:06:06.620> now<00:06:06.740> in<00:06:06.830> this<00:06:06.919> position<00:06:07.069> came

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
here he right now in this position came

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:13.450 
here he right now in this position came
over<00:06:07.580> there<00:06:07.729> and<00:06:07.819> we're<00:06:07.940> gonna<00:06:08.330> their<00:06:08.660> win<00:06:12.460> and

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
over there and we're gonna their win and

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.490 
over there and we're gonna their win and
the<00:06:13.610> Kings<00:06:13.789> side<00:06:13.970> loses<00:06:14.270> and<00:06:14.660> black<00:06:14.870> wins<00:06:15.169> if

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
the Kings side loses and black wins if

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:20.290 
the Kings side loses and black wins if
the<00:06:15.860> King<00:06:16.099> is<00:06:16.310> surrounded<00:06:16.819> on<00:06:16.990> four<00:06:18.819> all<00:06:19.819> four

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:20.300 
the King is surrounded on four all four

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:21.850 
the King is surrounded on four all four
points<00:06:20.930> of<00:06:20.990> the<00:06:21.050> compass<00:06:21.139> is<00:06:21.620> at<00:06:21.740> the

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
points of the compass is at the

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:26.860 
points of the compass is at the
coordinate<00:06:22.250> points<00:06:22.780> just<00:06:23.780> like<00:06:23.840> this<00:06:25.750> so<00:06:26.750> now

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
coordinate points just like this so now

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.999 
coordinate points just like this so now
the<00:06:26.930> king<00:06:27.349> has<00:06:27.500> lost<00:06:27.710> the<00:06:27.860> game<00:06:29.680> can't<00:06:30.680> just<00:06:30.919> be

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
the king has lost the game can't just be

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:34.180 
the king has lost the game can't just be
three<00:06:31.250> it<00:06:31.310> has<00:06:31.430> to<00:06:31.550> be<00:06:31.639> all<00:06:31.820> four<00:06:32.150> and<00:06:32.979> it<00:06:33.979> can't

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:34.190 
three it has to be all four and it can't

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:37.029 
three it has to be all four and it can't
be<00:06:34.340> diagonal<00:06:34.880> so<00:06:35.479> if<00:06:35.599> they<00:06:35.750> these<00:06:36.500> are<00:06:36.650> just<00:06:36.889> on

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 
be diagonal so if they these are just on

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:38.800 
be diagonal so if they these are just on
the<00:06:37.130> floor<00:06:37.370> I<00:06:37.550> go<00:06:37.910> around<00:06:38.030> the<00:06:38.210> game<00:06:38.449> that's

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:38.810 
the floor I go around the game that's

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.930 
the floor I go around the game that's
not<00:06:38.990> captured<00:06:39.380> at<00:06:39.500> all<00:06:39.680> because<00:06:40.419> and<00:06:42.729> the<00:06:43.729> last

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
not captured at all because and the last

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.810 
not captured at all because and the last
thing<00:06:44.240> about<00:06:44.570> that<00:06:45.229> is<00:06:45.979> the<00:06:46.009> King<00:06:46.430> can<00:06:46.639> lose

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:46.820 
thing about that is the King can lose

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:48.820 
thing about that is the King can lose
one<00:06:47.120> other<00:06:47.270> way<00:06:47.479> and<00:06:47.690> that's<00:06:47.780> if<00:06:48.020> he's<00:06:48.199> next<00:06:48.620> to

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:48.830 
one other way and that's if he's next to

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:50.649 
one other way and that's if he's next to
the<00:06:48.979> this<00:06:49.460> piece<00:06:49.639> is<00:06:49.819> called<00:06:49.880> this<00:06:50.180> square<00:06:50.569> is

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:50.659 
the this piece is called this square is

00:06:50.659 --> 00:06:54.790 
the this piece is called this square is
called<00:06:50.810> the<00:06:50.960> throne<00:06:51.259> and<00:06:53.289> if<00:06:54.289> he's<00:06:54.530> surrounded

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:54.800 
called the throne and if he's surrounded

00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:57.520 
called the throne and if he's surrounded
on<00:06:55.099> three<00:06:55.130> sides<00:06:55.400> and<00:06:56.150> the<00:06:56.870> throne<00:06:57.139> he<00:06:57.320> can't

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:57.530 
on three sides and the throne he can't

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:58.990 
on three sides and the throne he can't
move<00:06:57.620> back<00:06:57.830> onto<00:06:58.009> the<00:06:58.250> throne<00:06:58.490> below<00:06:58.759> that

00:06:58.990 --> 00:06:59.000 
move back onto the throne below that

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.129 
move back onto the throne below that
rule<00:06:59.330> later<00:06:59.590> but<00:07:01.240> these<00:07:02.240> also<00:07:02.449> captured<00:07:02.960> there

00:07:03.129 --> 00:07:03.139 
rule later but these also captured there

00:07:03.139 --> 00:07:06.279 
rule later but these also captured there
so<00:07:03.500> that's<00:07:03.740> that's<00:07:04.070> how<00:07:04.570> both<00:07:05.570> sides<00:07:05.599> wouldn't

00:07:06.279 --> 00:07:06.289 
so that's that's how both sides wouldn't

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:10.330 
so that's that's how both sides wouldn't
win<00:07:06.409> the<00:07:06.530> game<00:07:07.719> then<00:07:08.719> the<00:07:08.960> third<00:07:09.229> rule<00:07:09.530> that<00:07:10.250> I

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
win the game then the third rule that I

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.129 
win the game then the third rule that I
wanted<00:07:10.639> to<00:07:10.909> discuss<00:07:11.389> is<00:07:12.759> how<00:07:13.759> to<00:07:14.449> capture<00:07:14.780> the

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:15.139 
wanted to discuss is how to capture the

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:24.350 
wanted to discuss is how to capture the
pieces<00:07:15.650> and<00:07:16.550> you<00:07:17.740> capture<00:07:18.740> the<00:07:18.860> pieces

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:24.360 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.480 

by<00:07:24.810> what's<00:07:25.020> called<00:07:25.080> custodial<00:07:25.800> capture<00:07:26.250> and

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:26.490 
by what's called custodial capture and

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.460 
by what's called custodial capture and
that<00:07:26.640> means<00:07:26.820> that<00:07:26.970> it<00:07:27.060> takes<00:07:27.210> two<00:07:27.480> takes<00:07:28.350> two

00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:28.470 
that means that it takes two takes two

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:32.960 
that means that it takes two takes two
pieces<00:07:28.800> to<00:07:28.950> capture<00:07:29.280> one<00:07:29.580> and<00:07:31.610> let's<00:07:32.610> say<00:07:32.790> this

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:32.970 
pieces to capture one and let's say this

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:35.120 
pieces to capture one and let's say this
guy<00:07:33.150> goes<00:07:33.420> down<00:07:33.450> here<00:07:33.960> and<00:07:34.200> then<00:07:34.380> black<00:07:34.830> moves

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:35.130 
guy goes down here and then black moves

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.910 
guy goes down here and then black moves
you<00:07:35.550> know<00:07:35.640> and<00:07:35.880> then<00:07:36.170> this<00:07:37.170> guy<00:07:37.380> next<00:07:37.590> I<00:07:37.710> comes

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:37.920 
you know and then this guy next I comes

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.610 
you know and then this guy next I comes
here<00:07:38.130> so<00:07:38.310> this<00:07:38.490> this<00:07:38.730> guy<00:07:39.080> is<00:07:40.080> going<00:07:40.350> he's

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 
here so this this guy is going he's

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:43.370 
here so this this guy is going he's
captured<00:07:41.070> because<00:07:42.000> he<00:07:42.300> was<00:07:42.420> captured

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:43.380 
captured because he was captured

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.650 
captured because he was captured
orthogonal<00:07:44.160> II<00:07:44.520> like<00:07:44.850> that<00:07:44.880> they<00:07:45.240> also<00:07:45.390> call

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:45.660 
orthogonal II like that they also call

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.990 
orthogonal II like that they also call
that<00:07:45.810> sandwich<00:07:46.230> him<00:07:48.710> and<00:07:49.710> it<00:07:50.250> can't<00:07:50.490> be

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 
that sandwich him and it can't be

00:07:51.000 --> 00:08:00.610 
that sandwich him and it can't be
it<00:07:51.930> cannot<00:07:52.170> be<00:07:54.830> captured<00:07:57.530> okay

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:00.620 

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:04.370 

the<00:08:01.620> thing<00:08:02.010> about<00:08:02.040> capturing<00:08:02.700> is<00:08:03.140> the<00:08:04.140> king

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:04.380 
the thing about capturing is the king

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:09.860 
the thing about capturing is the king
should<00:08:05.130> not<00:08:05.340> be<00:08:05.520> allowed<00:08:05.790> to<00:08:05.820> capture<00:08:07.070> so<00:08:08.870> you

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:09.870 
should not be allowed to capture so you

00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:11.930 
should not be allowed to capture so you
cannot<00:08:10.140> take<00:08:10.320> part<00:08:10.620> in<00:08:10.710> capture<00:08:11.130> so<00:08:11.370> you<00:08:11.820> know

00:08:11.930 --> 00:08:11.940 
cannot take part in capture so you know

00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:14.270 
cannot take part in capture so you know
if<00:08:12.030> you<00:08:12.120> had<00:08:12.300> this<00:08:12.510> here<00:08:12.930> this<00:08:13.350> was<00:08:13.500> here<00:08:13.770> the

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 
if you had this here this was here the

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.270 
if you had this here this was here the
King<00:08:14.490> comes<00:08:14.730> up<00:08:14.910> here
