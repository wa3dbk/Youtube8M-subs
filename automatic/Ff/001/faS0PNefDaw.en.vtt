was<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.460> most<00:01:10.640> challenging<00:01:10.850> part<00:01:11.210> of<00:01:11.450> the

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
was the most challenging part of the

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.810 
was the most challenging part of the
process<00:01:12.020> due<00:01:12.320> to<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.590> sheer<00:01:12.830> number<00:01:13.220> of<00:01:13.250> tiles

process due to the sheer number of tiles

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.240 
process due to the sheer number of tiles
I<00:01:14.000> tried<00:01:14.870> to<00:01:15.020> add<00:01:15.140> the<00:01:15.320> windows<00:01:15.650> thoughtfully

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
I tried to add the windows thoughtfully

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.800 
I tried to add the windows thoughtfully
making<00:01:16.580> sure<00:01:16.730> each<00:01:16.970> worked<00:01:17.270> well<00:01:17.570> with<00:01:17.750> the

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
making sure each worked well with the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.679 
making sure each worked well with the
image<00:01:18.200> already<00:01:18.440> there

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:22.689 

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:24.899 

the<00:01:23.560> windows<00:01:23.920> were<00:01:24.070> painted<00:01:24.399> over<00:01:24.609> a<00:01:24.640> two<00:01:24.880> day

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 
the windows were painted over a two day

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.969 
the windows were painted over a two day
period<00:01:25.359> in<00:01:25.659> the<00:01:25.810> sculpture<00:01:26.289> studio<00:01:26.350> and

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:26.979 
period in the sculpture studio and

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.790 
period in the sculpture studio and
McCall<00:01:27.249> Center<00:01:27.579> for<00:01:27.759> visual<00:01:27.909> art

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.530 

after<00:01:34.800> another<00:01:35.130> drying<00:01:35.550> period<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.240> mural

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
after another drying period the mural

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.930 
after another drying period the mural
had<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.930> be<00:01:37.050> assembled<00:01:37.590> again<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.640> final

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:38.940 
had to be assembled again the final

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.060 
had to be assembled again the final
piece<00:01:39.120> was<00:01:39.330> to<00:01:39.360> represent<00:01:39.720> a<00:01:40.140> living<00:01:40.530> complex

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
piece was to represent a living complex

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.190 
piece was to represent a living complex
so<00:01:41.460> each<00:01:41.640> tile<00:01:41.940> was<00:01:42.240> staggered<00:01:42.720> by<00:01:42.869> layering

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
so each tile was staggered by layering

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.550 
so each tile was staggered by layering
plywood<00:01:43.830> pieces<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.490> varying<00:01:44.880> Heights

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
plywood pieces and varying Heights

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.960 
plywood pieces and varying Heights
this<00:01:46.560> gave<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> mural<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.340> more<00:01:47.550> sculptural

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
this gave the mural a more sculptural

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.270 
this gave the mural a more sculptural
fill<00:01:48.479> similar<00:01:49.080> to<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.260> real<00:01:49.530> building<00:01:49.950> instead

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
individual paintings better and was just

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.260 
individual paintings better and was just
more<00:01:55.710> interesting<00:01:56.340> with<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> interacting
