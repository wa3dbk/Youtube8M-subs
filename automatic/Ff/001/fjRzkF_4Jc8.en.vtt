here he is out of position he knows that
if<00:01:25.920> he<00:01:26.009> checks<00:01:26.340> here<00:01:26.700> he's<00:01:26.850> going<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.179> faced

with probably a monster bet on the river

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.039 
with probably a monster bet on the river
and<00:01:30.420> he's<00:01:30.509> not<00:01:30.689> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:30.990> that<00:01:31.049> too<00:01:31.380> much

and he's not going to like that too much

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:35.359 
and he's not going to like that too much
this<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.350> value<00:01:34.469> of<00:01:34.770> position<00:01:35.250> of

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
this is the value of position of

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.980 
this is the value of position of
noblemen<00:01:35.670> holdem<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:36.209> ideas<00:01:36.630> taken

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
noblemen holdem and ideas taken

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.160 
noblemen holdem and ideas taken
advantage<00:01:37.409> of<00:01:37.530> it<00:01:37.679> perfectly<00:01:38.219> in<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.490> hand

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
advantage of it perfectly in this hand

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.959 
advantage of it perfectly in this hand
but<00:01:40.170> he's<00:01:40.350> done<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:40.829> obviously<00:01:41.429> sensing

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
but he's done so obviously sensing

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.940 
but he's done so obviously sensing
weakness<00:01:42.420> from<00:01:42.569> Eric<00:01:42.990> as<00:01:43.170> well<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.709> not<00:01:43.890> a

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
weakness from Eric as well it's not a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.899 
weakness from Eric as well it's not a
haphazard<00:01:44.280> play<00:01:44.850> from<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.179> guy<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.509> ivy<00:01:45.840> right

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.179 

I<00:01:53.630> think<00:01:54.630> if<00:01:54.749> Eric<00:01:55.049> calls<00:01:55.259> here<00:01:55.560> he<00:01:55.710> has<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.100> be

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
I think if Eric calls here he has to be

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.010 
I think if Eric calls here he has to be
committed<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.640> calling<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.179> river<00:01:57.390> if<00:01:57.600> if<00:01:57.840> an

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
committed to calling the river if if an

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:05.930 
committed to calling the river if if an
innocuous<00:01:58.439> card<00:01:58.770> comes<00:01:59.009> off<00:02:01.640> and<00:02:02.640> he<00:02:03.030> knows<00:02:03.240> it

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.490 

he<00:02:06.940> makes<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.450> call<00:02:07.800> 40,000<00:02:08.800> I<00:02:10.290> expect<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.319> see

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
he makes the call 40,000 I expect to see

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.320 
he makes the call 40,000 I expect to see
a<00:02:11.530> check<00:02:11.830> call<00:02:12.040> here<00:02:12.370> on<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.640> river<00:02:12.760> for<00:02:13.090> Eric

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
a check call here on the river for Eric

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
threat and Eric checks once more the

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.520 
threat and Eric checks once more the
only<00:02:19.060> way<00:02:19.180> ivy<00:02:19.480> can<00:02:19.660> win<00:02:19.810> here<00:02:20.020> is<00:02:20.110> with<00:02:20.260> a<00:02:20.290> big

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
only way ivy can win here is with a big

bet he has to tell a consistent story
it's<00:02:24.610> probably<00:02:24.790> putting<00:02:25.360> Eric<00:02:25.720> on<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.870> hand

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
it's probably putting Eric on a hand

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.410 
it's probably putting Eric on a hand
like<00:02:26.320> Queen<00:02:26.650> ten<00:02:26.950> or<00:02:27.190> ten<00:02:27.400> nine<00:02:27.670> or<00:02:27.940> maybe<00:02:28.030> ten

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
like Queen ten or ten nine or maybe ten

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.960

eight<00:02:29.040> those<00:02:30.040> are<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.220> hands<00:02:30.550> that<00:02:30.610> seem<00:02:30.880> to

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
eight those are the hands that seem to

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.240 
eight those are the hands that seem to
make<00:02:31.090> sense<00:02:31.150> to<00:02:31.510> me<00:02:31.770> those<00:02:32.770> would<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:33.040> course

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
make sense to me those would of course

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.250 
make sense to me those would of course
give<00:02:33.489> Eric<00:02:33.880> a<00:02:34.030> straight<00:02:34.390> draw<00:02:34.630> to<00:02:34.690> go<00:02:34.959> with<00:02:35.110> his

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
give Eric a straight draw to go with his
