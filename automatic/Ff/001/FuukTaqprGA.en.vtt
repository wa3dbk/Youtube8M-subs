00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
up to your set speed well now we've got

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.549 
up to your set speed well now we've got
a<00:00:56.850> chance<00:00:57.180> to<00:00:57.360> actually<00:00:57.989> give<00:00:58.530> a

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
a chance to actually give a

a chance to actually give a

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
demonstration to me as well as to you

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.319 
demonstration to me as well as to you
have<00:01:01.160> adaptive<00:01:02.160> cruise<00:01:02.399> control<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:03.149> is<00:01:03.300> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
have adaptive cruise control this is a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.420 
have adaptive cruise control this is a
system<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:03.840> we've<00:01:04.080> incorporated<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:05.159> Bentley

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
system that we've incorporated a Bentley

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.000 
system that we've incorporated a Bentley
now<00:01:05.519> as<00:01:05.580> an<00:01:05.760> option<00:01:06.119> on<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.900> o.9<00:01:07.260> Flying<00:01:07.619> Spur

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
now as an option on the o.9 Flying Spur

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.260 
now as an option on the o.9 Flying Spur
and<00:01:09.590> it<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.799> really<00:01:11.010> fantastic<00:01:11.310> system<00:01:11.939> for

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and it is a really fantastic system for

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.340 
and it is a really fantastic system for
me<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.479> something<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:13.020> I've<00:01:13.170> never

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
me it's something that I've never

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.770 
me it's something that I've never
experienced<00:01:14.250> before<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.790> we<00:01:15.360> have<00:01:15.540> in<00:01:15.659> this

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
experienced before and we have in this

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.320 
experienced before and we have in this
case<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.200> car<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:16.560> set<00:01:16.770> at<00:01:17.130> 70<00:01:17.759> miles<00:01:17.939> an<00:01:18.180> hour

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
case the car is set at 70 miles an hour

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.050 
case the car is set at 70 miles an hour
and<00:01:18.570> that<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.350> what<00:01:19.530> it'll<00:01:19.710> run<00:01:20.009> at<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.430> can

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
and that is what it'll run at I can

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.899 
and that is what it'll run at I can
adjust<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.990> how<00:01:22.170> how<00:01:22.799> close<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:23.460> want<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.729> be

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
adjust it to how how close I want to be

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.969 
adjust it to how how close I want to be
to<00:01:24.090> the<00:01:24.210> car<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.570> front<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.590> car<00:01:25.830> will

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
to the car in front and the car will

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.700 
to the car in front and the car will
therefore<00:01:26.159> run<00:01:26.520> at<00:01:26.729> that<00:01:26.880> speed<00:01:27.270> at<00:01:27.960> 70<00:01:28.530> miles

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
therefore run at that speed at 70 miles

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.710 
therefore run at that speed at 70 miles
an<00:01:28.890> hour<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.070> this<00:01:29.159> particular<00:01:29.460> case<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.180> if

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
an hour in this particular case and if

somebody pulls in front of me it would

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.950 
somebody pulls in front of me it would
immediately<00:01:32.280> slow<00:01:33.060> me<00:01:33.240> down<00:01:33.270> or<00:01:33.630> put<00:01:33.840> the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
and the deceleration limit is about 30%

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.940 
and the deceleration limit is about 30%
of<00:01:56.160> full<00:01:56.400> braking<00:01:56.760> now<00:01:57.620> this<00:01:58.620> is<00:01:58.710> going<00:01:58.890> to

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
of full braking now this is going to

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.250 
of full braking now this is going to
take<00:01:59.130> me<00:01:59.280> right<00:01:59.460> down<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.300> very<00:02:00.600> very<00:02:00.930> slow

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
take me right down to a very very slow

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.500 
take me right down to a very very slow
speed<00:02:01.620> at<00:02:01.770> the<00:02:01.860> junction<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.910> in<00:02:03.030> fact<00:02:03.210> we

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
speed at the junction and in fact we

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.940 
speed at the junction and in fact we
have<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.660> thing<00:02:03.900> called<00:02:03.930> followed<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.650> stop

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
have a thing called followed to stop

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.320 
have a thing called followed to stop
with<00:02:05.220> this<00:02:05.340> particular<00:02:05.520> system<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.180> is

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:06.330 
with this particular system that is

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.350 
with this particular system that is
actually<00:02:07.140> particularly<00:02:07.890> special<00:02:08.400> to<00:02:08.790> Bentley

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
actually particularly special to Bentley

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.960 
actually particularly special to Bentley
and<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.350> will<00:02:10.470> allow<00:02:10.770> us<00:02:11.010> to<00:02:11.550> actually<00:02:11.700> go

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
and it will allow us to actually go

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.540 
and it will allow us to actually go
right<00:02:12.240> down<00:02:12.600> to<00:02:12.900> zero<00:02:13.380> miles<00:02:13.650> an<00:02:13.800> hour<00:02:13.950> look<00:02:14.460> at

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
right down to zero miles an hour look at

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.280 
right down to zero miles an hour look at
that<00:02:14.670> right<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.210> way<00:02:15.300> down<00:02:15.330> right<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.170> way

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
that right the way down right the way

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.590 
that right the way down right the way
down<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:17.400> stop<00:02:17.670> look<00:02:17.940> at<00:02:18.030> that<00:02:18.180> isn't<00:02:18.420> that

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
down to stop look at that isn't that

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:19.370 
down to stop look at that isn't that
fantastic

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
fantastic

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.110 
fantastic
this<00:02:19.860> actually<00:02:20.160> stopped<00:02:20.400> over<00:02:20.550> gotta<00:02:20.940> love<00:02:21.030> it

this actually stopped over gotta love it
on<00:02:21.240> the<00:02:21.360> brakes<00:02:21.570> what<00:02:22.440> this<00:02:22.620> means<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:22.980> the

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
on the brakes what this means to the

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.880 
on the brakes what this means to the
customer<00:02:23.550> is<00:02:23.880> that<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.870> driving<00:02:25.560> experience

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
customer is that the driving experience

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.100 
customer is that the driving experience
is<00:02:26.520> much<00:02:26.670> smoother<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.390> more<00:02:27.660> comfortable
