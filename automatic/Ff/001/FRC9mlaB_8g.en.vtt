when<00:01:49.590> you<00:01:49.740> make<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:49.920> successful<00:01:50.490> potion<00:01:51.149> it

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:12.690 
of the runes so I'm just going
completely<00:03:11.019> blindsided<00:03:11.470> into<00:03:12.190> making<00:03:12.459> this

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:12.700 
completely blindsided into making this

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.600 
completely blindsided into making this
glyph<00:03:13.060> so<00:03:13.450> here<00:03:13.720> we<00:03:13.810> go<00:03:13.989> now<00:03:14.260> as<00:03:14.980> you<00:03:15.400> saw

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
glyph so here we go now as you saw

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.460 
glyph so here we go now as you saw
before<00:03:15.790> after<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.510> made<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.810> glyph<00:03:17.230> it

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
before after I made the glyph it

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.199 
before after I made the glyph it
translated<00:03:18.370> those<00:03:18.549> runes

00:03:19.199 --> 00:03:19.209 
translated those runes

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.630 
translated those runes
those<00:03:19.480> three<00:03:19.840> runes<00:03:20.140> that<00:03:20.350> I<00:03:20.410> used<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:21.190> now<00:03:21.459> in

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
those three runes that I used so now in

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.580 
those three runes that I used so now in
future<00:03:22.120> when<00:03:22.329> I<00:03:22.359> go<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.600> use<00:03:22.810> those<00:03:23.019> rooms<00:03:23.320> I'll

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
future when I go to use those rooms I'll

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.440 
future when I go to use those rooms I'll
have<00:03:23.769> a<00:03:23.799> rough<00:03:24.040> idea<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.519> what<00:03:24.700> that<00:03:24.850> rune<00:03:25.090> will

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450

the first glyph I use tar as the aspect
rune<00:05:01.779> which<00:05:02.050> the<00:05:02.439> lowest<00:05:03.129> quality<00:05:03.849> aspect

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
rune which the lowest quality aspect

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:26.999 
the quality of the glyph basically
determines<00:05:25.930> how<00:05:26.050> powerful<00:05:26.590> the<00:05:26.680> glyph<00:05:26.860> will

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
determines how powerful the glyph will

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:28.290
