00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.859
 you are all the fans of Italy but at the 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.230
 world a bit more then too much of 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.840
 world tour still so two and so 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.250
 damage to one and from the years too 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:17.449
 having less and less must do different than 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.000
 you have to make goals at the end of the world is not 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:22.560
 it is not as if they had in fact by 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.439
 provinces of italy 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.029
 ten million people say that 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.890
 maybe something wrong 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:33.840
 but if to such a small and known broadcaster 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.850
 to make him a transmission that in short 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.550
 there was this one thing having to 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.989
 so worried when when the 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:47.460
 Padania will make the world stop 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:50.039
 position to say it with teheran from of 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.879
 Michele for likely risks 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.039
 exit out of the world and asks the 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.030
 france no a condition is created 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:02.399
 almost dramatic ranking so can 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.350
 imagine what you write to us 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:10.020
 as well as sinar mas and nando is first 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:13.080
 world tour absolute food by institution 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:16.580
 don't pass the tour and the other failure 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.580
 do not pass the eighths 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.730
 ugly to say that with writing we will succeed 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.180
 however, I think to arrive in the top four 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.220
 that it is also realistic to hope for 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.780
 to get there on the hospital to get there 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.030
 that 's a second me is a goal 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.380
 in inverted commas is not a goal with the 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.720
 important stage 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.510
 when will the 24 met in 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.030
 italy brazil argentina england o 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:43.780
 brazil argentina spain then leader a 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.000
 games and it really can be this 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.640
 decisive to the condition of a player 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.160
 rather than the motion even more 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:54.370
 therefore, however, as values â€‹â€‹we must 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:57.040
 get less at least in the semifinals e 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.660
 not only in Italy to get there then it is 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.430
 natural than if in the final quarterfinals against 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.890
 the whole spain then traveled there 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:08.170
 a small final must be played on 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.660
 secret of that team that thinks 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.390
 a few words was also this is 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.800
 made to have so many too many to say 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.590
 personality players but sofa 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.760
 curious for the maximum hut, but the hut 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.170
 a little bit in the last step 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.280
 last 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.900
 in the last few minutes we are 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.910
 were perhaps not pungent not only the 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.120
 first time despite having the 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.550
 ball of the game to go maybe not anymore 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:39.400
 strong talented not stronger 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:41.410
 we have more genius though you 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.330
 perhaps not grateful because I feel that 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.480
 if he goes to the party of lack of talent 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.880
 but so much is not just the tunnel shot of 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.190
 heel also a young man like him giulia e 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.560
 we have the Internet to some in 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.739
 especially because he made two cartoons 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.090
 made material seem to prevail 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.430
 piero gilardino 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.810
 therefore there has not been a 1 that is 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.120
 distinct for the realization vein of 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.760
 time perhaps a bit more malice 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:14.770
 moderate type can help you lacked 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:18.820
 lavezzi homicidal nothing I wanted to say to 3 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.610
 the same thing clearly speaks of one 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.040
 society comes to mind that it is not that it has 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.580
 always returned to the sender all 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.670
 offers 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:29.920
 yes I must have done it not later 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.830
 two days ago my president 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:35.020
 so I think that nothing changes 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:38.620
 the wait regarding mine 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:43.990
 francesco we are tough when it seemed 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.730
 what to say but maybe we say ours 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:47.920
 quotes problem that that is not a 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.590
 problem how can that be when 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.890
 we must say something we say the fact 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:57.550
 that we are Romans can appreciate for 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.190
 some human I think you the controversy 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.360
 that we brought astori behind is 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.910
 also due our character a little 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.720
 that we are so today we have something from 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:09.790
 say we say it but I do n't now because 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.070
 now he will have to do a world championship but make it 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:15.160
 to overwhelm these use said but 

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.930
 as before I will stay and I think he said 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:18.910
 of the magician until the end of the contract of 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.980
 roma in time they talked about ours 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.730
 of me he spoke in these terms he has 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.730
 run-in cold
