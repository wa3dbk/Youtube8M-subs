what he's going to do next what's it

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.500 
what he's going to do next what's it
like<00:03:49.740> for<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:50.100> person<00:03:50.670> like<00:03:50.760> you<00:03:50.820> entering<00:03:51.420> the

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:51.510 
like for a person like you entering the

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:53.270 
like for a person like you entering the
draft<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:52.050> I<00:03:52.170> guess<00:03:52.590> having<00:03:52.830> all<00:03:53.130> these

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
draft and I guess having all these

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.760 
draft and I guess having all these
expectations<00:03:53.870> well<00:03:54.870> I<00:03:54.900> really<00:03:55.440> hurt<00:03:55.620> myself

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
expectations well I really hurt myself

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.410 
expectations well I really hurt myself
at<00:03:56.070> a<00:03:56.100> higher<00:03:56.280> standard<00:03:56.580> than<00:03:56.730> most<00:03:56.970> people<00:03:57.270> do

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
at a higher standard than most people do

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.750 
at a higher standard than most people do
so<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.500> know<00:03:58.620> all<00:03:58.770> those<00:03:58.950> expectations<00:03:59.280> and

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
so you know all those expectations and

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.880 
so you know all those expectations and
pressures<00:04:00.150> that<00:04:00.180> are<00:04:00.360> on<00:04:00.480> me<00:04:00.840> they<00:04:01.590> they're

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
not outweighed by the standards I'll

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.570 
not outweighed by the standards I'll
keep<00:04:03.660> myself<00:04:03.780> as<00:04:04.170> so<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:05.010> pressured<00:04:05.340> I'm<00:04:05.430> not
