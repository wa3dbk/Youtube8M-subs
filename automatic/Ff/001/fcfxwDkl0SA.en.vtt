however<00:00:22.380> Roland<00:00:22.859> was<00:00:23.039> also<00:00:23.369> pretty<00:00:23.609> clever

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
however Roland was also pretty clever

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.630 
however Roland was also pretty clever
and<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.240> they<00:00:24.480> gave<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.990> arpeggio<00:00:25.830> clock<00:00:26.340> and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
and that they gave a arpeggio clock and

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.450 
and that they gave a arpeggio clock and
input<00:00:27.380> designed<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.710> used<00:00:28.949> with<00:00:29.160> some<00:00:29.340> of

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
input designed to be used with some of

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.279 
input designed to be used with some of
the<00:00:29.519> other<00:00:29.670> Roland<00:00:30.119> drum<00:00:30.300> machines<00:00:30.630> that<00:00:31.019> had

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
the other Roland drum machines that had

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.959 
the other Roland drum machines that had
a<00:00:31.529> output<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> +<00:00:32.730> v<00:00:33.030> DC<00:00:33.329> wave<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:34.680> plus<00:00:35.610> YDC

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
a output of a + v DC wave that plus YDC

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.490 
a output of a + v DC wave that plus YDC
weight<00:00:36.300> would<00:00:36.480> then<00:00:36.630> pulse<00:00:36.930> out<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.320> drum

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
weight would then pulse out of the drum

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.900 
weight would then pulse out of the drum
machine<00:00:37.590> being<00:00:38.070> controlled<00:00:38.489> by<00:00:38.579> the<00:00:38.670> drum

machine<00:00:39.000> sequencer<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.020> clock<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.710> this

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
machine sequencer and clock and this

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.000 
machine sequencer and clock and this
synthesizer<00:00:42.450> would<00:00:42.750> receive<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.469> then

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
synthesizer would receive it and then

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.740 
synthesizer would receive it and then
use<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.219> as<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.700> rate<00:00:44.879> so<00:00:45.210> now<00:00:45.539> with<00:00:45.719> that

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
use it as the rate so now with that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.720 
use it as the rate so now with that
plugged<00:00:46.079> in<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:47.129> can't<00:00:47.370> hear<00:00:47.520> anything

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
plugged in and can't hear anything

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.490 
plugged in and can't hear anything
because<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.180> actually<00:00:48.329> waiting<00:00:48.840> for<00:00:48.870> that

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
because it's actually waiting for that

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.680 
because it's actually waiting for that
pulse<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.920> show<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:51.090> where<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> don't<00:00:51.510> have<00:00:51.660> a

classic<00:00:56.329> roland<00:00:57.329> drum<00:00:57.510> machines<00:00:57.870> I<00:00:58.170> do<00:00:59.100> have<00:00:59.370> a

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
classic roland drum machines I do have a

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.740 
classic roland drum machines I do have a
sampler<00:00:59.940> that<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.329> could<00:01:00.809> load<00:01:01.109> up<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:02.750> rimshot

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
sampler that I could load up a rimshot

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.600 
sampler that I could load up a rimshot
sample<00:01:04.439> from<00:01:04.650> one<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.920> those<00:01:05.040> drum<00:01:05.280> machines

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
sample from one of those drum machines

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.760 
sample from one of those drum machines
which<00:01:05.909> still<00:01:06.210> has<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.750> waveform<00:01:07.140> at<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.590> end

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
which still has that waveform at the end

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.250 
which still has that waveform at the end
still<00:01:08.100> embedded<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.580> it<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.659> one<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.020> can

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
still embedded in it so one way we can

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.240 
still embedded in it so one way we can
hear<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.740> is<00:01:11.570> that's<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.840> rimshot<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:14.130> what

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
hear that is that's the rimshot so what

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.830 
hear that is that's the rimshot so what
I've<00:01:14.340> done<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.880> took<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.119> same<00:01:15.450> rimshot

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
I've done is I took the same rimshot

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.940 
I've done is I took the same rimshot
sound<00:01:16.520> and<00:01:17.520> put<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:17.880> into<00:01:18.090> this<00:01:18.210> pad<00:01:18.509> here<00:01:19.080> went

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
sound and put it into this pad here went

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.760 
sound and put it into this pad here went
over<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.430> mixer<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.140> change<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.439> pads

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
over to the mixer and change that pads

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.560 
over to the mixer and change that pads
output<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:24.570> actually<00:01:25.320> go<00:01:26.000> to<00:01:27.000> this<00:01:27.150> cable<00:01:27.540> here

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
output to actually go to this cable here

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.350 
output to actually go to this cable here
which<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.020> on<00:01:28.200> output<00:01:28.860> one<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:29.939> this<00:01:30.060> cable

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
which is on output one so this cable

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.740 
which is on output one so this cable
runs<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.780> then<00:01:31.680> goes<00:01:31.860> into<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.729> Juno<00:01:32.970> 60<00:01:33.450> and

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
runs out then goes into the Juno 60 and

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.149 
runs out then goes into the Juno 60 and
now<00:01:34.380> whenever<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.890> play<00:01:35.430> that<00:01:35.670> rimshot<00:01:36.150> sound

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
now whenever I play that rimshot sound

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.969 
now whenever I play that rimshot sound
you<00:01:38.159> can't<00:01:38.369> hear<00:01:38.549> anything<00:01:39.170> but<00:01:40.170> if<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.860> were<00:01:40.950> to

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
you can't hear anything but if I were to

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.560 
you can't hear anything but if I were to
hold<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.400> note<00:01:41.610> on<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.180> Juno<00:01:42.420> 16<00:01:44.270> which<00:01:45.270> again

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
hold a note on the Juno 16 which again

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:46.969 
hold a note on the Juno 16 which again
the<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.960> Juno<00:01:46.170> 60<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.530> basically<00:01:46.860> just

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
the the Juno 60 is basically just

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.200 
the the Juno 60 is basically just
pretending<00:01:47.430> that<00:01:47.520> my<00:01:47.610> fingers<00:01:47.909> are<00:01:48.000> still

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
pretending that my fingers are still

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.270 
pretending that my fingers are still
holding<00:01:48.540> on<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.840> now<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> can<00:01:49.890> push<00:01:50.100> this

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
holding on to the now I can push this

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.160 
holding on to the now I can push this
and<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.939> rate<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.149> which<00:01:54.479> I<00:01:54.630> push<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.110> button

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
and the rate of which I push this button

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.160 
and the rate of which I push this button
will<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:55.950> how<00:01:56.130> quickly<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:57.149> Juno<00:01:57.420> 60<00:01:57.750> plays<00:01:57.990> to

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
will be how quickly the Juno 60 plays to

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.030 
will be how quickly the Juno 60 plays to
the<00:01:58.259> arpeggiated<00:01:58.829> notes<00:02:00.680> so<00:02:01.680> then<00:02:01.829> you<00:02:01.890> can

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the arpeggiated notes so then you can

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:18.490 
the arpeggiated notes so then you can
embed<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.610> within<00:02:03.570> say<00:02:03.960> a<00:02:03.990> beat

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:41.809 

explains<00:02:19.500> those<00:02:19.830> actual<00:02:20.430> notes

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.969 

thanks<00:02:42.819> for<00:02:42.909> watching
