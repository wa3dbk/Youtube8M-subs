add<00:02:44.989> position<00:02:45.989> number<00:02:46.079> two<00:02:46.470> we<00:02:46.709> got<00:02:46.829> the

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
add position number two we got the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.460 
add position number two we got the
Astros<00:02:47.120> 850<00:02:48.120> these<00:02:48.450> are<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.750> next<00:02:48.930> version<00:02:49.230> of

the eight bodies and these are wireless

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.660 
the eight bodies and these are wireless
obviously<00:02:52.590> there's<00:02:52.769> always<00:02:53.069> that<00:02:53.190> latency

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
obviously there's always that latency

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.819 
obviously there's always that latency
problems<00:02:54.269> but<00:02:54.780> it<00:02:54.959> is<00:02:55.079> minuscule<00:02:55.560> and<00:02:55.739> you

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
problems but it is minuscule and you

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.039 
problems but it is minuscule and you
probably<00:02:56.099> won't<00:02:56.459> notice<00:02:56.670> it<00:02:57.000> again<00:02:57.629> this

00:02:58.039 --> 00:02:58.049 
probably won't notice it again this

00:02:58.049 --> 00:02:59.690 
probably won't notice it again this
don't<00:02:58.379> have<00:02:58.590> a<00:02:58.620> mix<00:02:58.950> em<00:02:59.129> everything<00:02:59.459> is

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
don't have a mix em everything is

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.759

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
run at three hundred dollars so these

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.839 
run at three hundred dollars so these
are<00:03:04.200> probably<00:03:04.799> the<00:03:04.890> most<00:03:05.069> expensive<00:03:05.489> pets

00:03:05.839 --> 00:03:05.849
