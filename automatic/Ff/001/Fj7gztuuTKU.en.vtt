00:05:07.869 --> 00:05:07.879 
which I use this ceramic curl by

00:05:07.879 --> 00:05:10.929 
which I use this ceramic curl by
Remington<00:05:08.330> and<00:05:09.080> it<00:05:09.590> goes<00:05:09.710> up<00:05:09.949> to<00:05:10.129> 450<00:05:10.909> degrees

00:05:10.929 --> 00:05:10.939 
Remington and it goes up to 450 degrees

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:13.149 
Remington and it goes up to 450 degrees
so<00:05:11.419> I<00:05:11.449> turn<00:05:11.659> it<00:05:11.780> all<00:05:11.990> the<00:05:12.020> way<00:05:12.110> up<00:05:12.199> this<00:05:12.830> is<00:05:12.979> nice

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
so I turn it all the way up this is nice

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:14.559 
so I turn it all the way up this is nice
because<00:05:13.370> it<00:05:13.490> has<00:05:13.639> a<00:05:13.669> little<00:05:13.849> heat<00:05:14.090> sensor<00:05:14.449> and

00:05:14.559 --> 00:05:14.569 
because it has a little heat sensor and

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:15.879 
because it has a little heat sensor and
it<00:05:14.629> tells<00:05:14.810> you<00:05:14.960> when<00:05:15.080> it's<00:05:15.229> heating<00:05:15.530> up<00:05:15.680> and

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
it tells you when it's heating up and

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:17.679 
it tells you when it's heating up and
then<00:05:16.009> it'll<00:05:16.219> beep<00:05:16.430> when<00:05:16.729> it's<00:05:16.879> heated<00:05:17.360> up<00:05:17.659> to

I don't tie it tight I just kind of like
loosely<00:05:30.740> wrap<00:05:31.310> it<00:05:31.550> and<00:05:31.810> the<00:05:32.810> biggest<00:05:33.080> trick<00:05:33.409> is

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:33.620 
loosely wrap it and the biggest trick is

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:36.189 
loosely wrap it and the biggest trick is
just<00:05:33.650> using<00:05:34.460> really<00:05:34.849> small<00:05:35.300> sections<00:05:35.930> and

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:36.199

00:05:38.649 --> 00:05:38.659 
starting as close to the root as you can

00:05:38.659 --> 00:05:40.689 
starting as close to the root as you can
without<00:05:38.930> burning<00:05:39.349> yourself<00:05:39.590> and<00:05:40.189> then<00:05:40.639> you

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
without burning yourself and then you

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:44.140 
without burning yourself and then you
also<00:05:40.939> want<00:05:41.840> to<00:05:42.020> kind<00:05:42.620> of<00:05:42.710> avoid<00:05:42.860> the<00:05:43.279> ends<00:05:43.879> I

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.150
