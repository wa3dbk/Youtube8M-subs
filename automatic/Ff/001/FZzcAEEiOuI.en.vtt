defending I believe when I did his
prediction<00:04:38.010> but<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.550> definitely<00:04:38.880> didn't

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
prediction but I definitely didn't

downgrade<00:04:39.660> it<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:40.260> much<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:40.740> didn't<00:04:40.950> think<00:04:41.070> EA

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
downgrade it that much I didn't think EA

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.550 
downgrade it that much I didn't think EA
would<00:04:41.780> really<00:04:42.780> drop<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.080> down<00:04:43.230> that<00:04:43.440> much

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:43.560

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
possible and shooting though and I think

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.760 
possible and shooting though and I think
a<00:04:45.630> little<00:04:45.810> change<00:04:46.020> on<00:04:46.230> the<00:04:46.320> physical<00:04:46.620> things

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
a little change on the physical things
