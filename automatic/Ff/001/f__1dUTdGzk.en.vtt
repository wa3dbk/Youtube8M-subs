hi<00:00:05.229> I'm<00:00:05.319> Val<00:00:05.529> with<00:00:05.799> hammer<00:00:06.009> in<00:00:06.160> hand<00:00:06.370> out<00:00:06.729> here

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.000 
hi I'm Val with hammer in hand out here

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.420 
hi I'm Val with hammer in hand out here
at<00:00:07.089> the<00:00:07.179> pumpkin<00:00:07.540> Ridge<00:00:07.689> Passivhaus<00:00:08.430> talked

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:09.430 
at the pumpkin Ridge Passivhaus talked

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.459 
at the pumpkin Ridge Passivhaus talked
about<00:00:09.700> a<00:00:09.730> little<00:00:09.940> bit<00:00:10.090> about<00:00:10.469> mechanical

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:11.469 
about a little bit about mechanical

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:13.830 
about a little bit about mechanical
systems<00:00:11.889> and<00:00:12.129> how<00:00:12.879> they<00:00:13.029> interface<00:00:13.449> with<00:00:13.510> the

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:13.840 
systems and how they interface with the

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.299 
systems and how they interface with the
passive<00:00:14.320> house<00:00:14.469> and<00:00:14.770> how<00:00:14.859> they<00:00:15.039> interface

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
passive house and how they interface

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:18.150 
passive house and how they interface
with<00:00:15.490> our<00:00:15.760> air<00:00:16.029> barriers<00:00:16.390> specifically<00:00:17.050> as<00:00:17.920> we

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
with our air barriers specifically as we

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.029 
with our air barriers specifically as we
look<00:00:18.310> at<00:00:18.430> this<00:00:18.550> piece<00:00:18.820> of<00:00:19.000> plumbing<00:00:19.180> out<00:00:19.480> here

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
look at this piece of plumbing out here

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.210 
look at this piece of plumbing out here
this<00:00:21.039> is<00:00:21.310> a<00:00:21.730> standard<00:00:22.560> hose<00:00:23.560> bib

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:24.220 
this is a standard hose bib

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.220 
this is a standard hose bib
that's<00:00:24.430> frost<00:00:24.940> protected<00:00:25.420> hose<00:00:25.539> bib<00:00:25.750> so<00:00:26.050> the

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
that's frost protected hose bib so the

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.460 
that's frost protected hose bib so the
the<00:00:26.920> valve<00:00:27.160> is<00:00:27.430> actually<00:00:27.820> back<00:00:28.029> here<00:00:28.420> so<00:00:29.230> when

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.470 
the valve is actually back here so when

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.410 
the valve is actually back here so when
when<00:00:29.949> you<00:00:30.070> shut<00:00:30.279> it<00:00:30.310> off<00:00:30.520> the<00:00:30.820> water<00:00:31.000> drains

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
when you shut it off the water drains

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.360 
when you shut it off the water drains
out<00:00:31.690> from<00:00:31.990> here<00:00:32.320> out<00:00:33.090> standard<00:00:34.090> stuff<00:00:34.359> and<00:00:35.370> so

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.370 
out from here out standard stuff and so

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.849 
out from here out standard stuff and so
we<00:00:36.399> have<00:00:36.729> to<00:00:36.940> make<00:00:37.089> sure<00:00:37.120> that<00:00:37.300> this<00:00:37.719> gets<00:00:38.559> in

00:00:38.849 --> 00:00:38.859 
we have to make sure that this gets in

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:41.459 
we have to make sure that this gets in
far<00:00:39.339> enough<00:00:39.489> at<00:00:39.789> least<00:00:39.969> into<00:00:40.420> the<00:00:40.539> warmer<00:00:41.260> part

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:41.469 
far enough at least into the warmer part

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:43.919 
far enough at least into the warmer part
of<00:00:41.559> the<00:00:41.620> wall<00:00:41.769> so<00:00:42.010> that<00:00:42.039> it's<00:00:42.479> never<00:00:43.479> gonna<00:00:43.659> see

00:00:43.919 --> 00:00:43.929 
of the wall so that it's never gonna see

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:46.379 
of the wall so that it's never gonna see
freezing<00:00:44.229> temperatures<00:00:44.920> but<00:00:45.879> we<00:00:45.969> also<00:00:46.120> don't

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:46.389 
freezing temperatures but we also don't

00:00:46.389 --> 00:00:49.669 
freezing temperatures but we also don't
want<00:00:46.659> this<00:00:46.899> to<00:00:47.260> carry<00:00:47.609> this<00:00:48.609> big<00:00:48.940> piece<00:00:49.210> of

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:49.679 
want this to carry this big piece of

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:53.129 
want this to carry this big piece of
copper<00:00:50.679> to<00:00:50.799> carry<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:52.329> heat<00:00:52.569> or<00:00:52.839> the<00:00:52.899> cold

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:53.139 
copper to carry the heat or the cold

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:55.949 
copper to carry the heat or the cold
into<00:00:53.769> our<00:00:54.100> heated<00:00:54.399> space<00:00:54.519> so<00:00:54.850> remember<00:00:55.239> behind

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:55.959 
into our heated space so remember behind

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:58.110 
into our heated space so remember behind
here<00:00:56.170> there's<00:00:56.350> also<00:00:56.530> a<00:00:56.679> 2x6<00:00:57.399> wall<00:00:57.489> cavity

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
here there's also a 2x6 wall cavity

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.879 
here there's also a 2x6 wall cavity
that's<00:00:58.870> that's<00:00:59.409> about<00:00:59.649> an<00:00:59.859> r21<00:01:00.449> so<00:01:01.889> this

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:02.889 
that's that's about an r21 so this

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:04.859 
that's that's about an r21 so this
intersection<00:01:03.459> is<00:01:03.879> pretty<00:01:04.299> much<00:01:04.420> happening

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
intersection is pretty much happening

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:07.200 
intersection is pretty much happening
towards<00:01:05.260> the<00:01:05.440> center<00:01:05.830> of<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.979> actual<00:01:06.880> overall

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:07.210 
towards the center of the actual overall

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.550 
towards the center of the actual overall
cavity<00:01:08.550> so<00:01:09.550> beyond<00:01:09.910> that<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:11.200> being

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
cavity so beyond that this being

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.830 
cavity so beyond that this being
standard<00:01:12.160> the<00:01:12.280> rest<00:01:12.460> of<00:01:12.610> it<00:01:12.700> is<00:01:12.850> fairly<00:01:13.330> not

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:13.840 
standard the rest of it is fairly not

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.810 
standard the rest of it is fairly not
standard<00:01:14.410> and<00:01:14.590> you<00:01:15.070> can<00:01:15.220> see<00:01:15.400> it's<00:01:15.550> kinda

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
standard and you can see it's kinda

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.490 
standard and you can see it's kinda
looks<00:01:16.060> weird<00:01:16.300> right<00:01:16.600> now<00:01:16.930> because<00:01:17.200> it's

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:17.500 
looks weird right now because it's

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.260 
looks weird right now because it's
sticking<00:01:17.710> out<00:01:17.860> so<00:01:18.070> far<00:01:18.250> you<00:01:18.760> have<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:18.940> keep<00:01:19.120> in

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
sticking out so far you have to keep in

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.840 
sticking out so far you have to keep in
mind<00:01:19.450> that<00:01:19.960> we<00:01:20.050> have<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:21.280> rest<00:01:21.490> of<00:01:21.610> the<00:01:21.700> wall

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
mind that we have the rest of the wall

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.960 
mind that we have the rest of the wall
cavity<00:01:22.300> going<00:01:22.630> on<00:01:22.750> out<00:01:22.930> here<00:01:22.960> in<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.670> form<00:01:24.880> of

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
cavity going on out here in the form of

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.510 
cavity going on out here in the form of
a<00:01:25.090> larson<00:01:25.450> truss<00:01:25.690> and<00:01:25.960> in<00:01:26.710> this<00:01:26.800> situation

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
a larson truss and in this situation

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.570 
a larson truss and in this situation
there's<00:01:28.210> an<00:01:28.390> architectural<00:01:29.020> detail

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
there's an architectural detail

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.240 
there's an architectural detail
typically<00:01:30.580> we<00:01:30.970> would<00:01:31.120> have<00:01:31.330> our<00:01:31.800> our<00:01:32.800> next

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.250 
typically we would have our our next

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.160 
typically we would have our our next
layer<00:01:33.580> of<00:01:33.700> sheathing<00:01:33.940> here<00:01:34.330> to<00:01:34.570> enclose<00:01:34.900> our

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
layer of sheathing here to enclose our

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.430 
layer of sheathing here to enclose our
insulation<00:01:35.710> cavity<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:36.460> out<00:01:37.270> beyond<00:01:37.600> here<00:01:38.020> we

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
insulation cavity and out beyond here we

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.860 
insulation cavity and out beyond here we
would<00:01:38.620> typically<00:01:38.950> have<00:01:39.220> a<00:01:39.870> three-quarter

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
would typically have a three-quarter

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.300 
would typically have a three-quarter
inch<00:01:40.990> rain<00:01:41.230> screen<00:01:41.470> in<00:01:41.680> this<00:01:41.800> case<00:01:41.860> the

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
inch rain screen in this case the

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.460 
inch rain screen in this case the
architect<00:01:42.760> wanted<00:01:43.060> to<00:01:43.150> add<00:01:43.240> some<00:01:43.600> more

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
architect wanted to add some more

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.790 
architect wanted to add some more
texture<00:01:44.830> to<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:45.190> building<00:01:45.550> and<00:01:45.760> so<00:01:46.450> they

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
texture to the building and so they

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.160 
texture to the building and so they
specified<00:01:47.800> different<00:01:48.510> rain<00:01:49.510> screens<00:01:49.840> in<00:01:50.050> this

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
specified different rain screens in this

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.840 
specified different rain screens in this
case<00:01:50.470> we<00:01:50.800> have<00:01:50.980> a<00:01:51.010> three<00:01:51.280> inch<00:01:51.400> rain<00:01:51.520> screen

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850

of<00:02:03.850> an<00:02:04.060> inch<00:02:04.120> to<00:02:04.270> 6<00:02:04.630> inches<00:02:04.990> depending<00:02:05.500> on

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
of an inch to 6 inches depending on

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.440 
of an inch to 6 inches depending on
where<00:02:05.800> you're<00:02:05.950> at<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:08.409> so<00:02:09.250> what<00:02:09.429> we<00:02:09.550> did<00:02:09.759> we<00:02:10.300> had

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
where you're at so so what we did we had

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.599 
where you're at so so what we did we had
our<00:02:10.569> plumber<00:02:11.040> roughed<00:02:12.040> this<00:02:12.220> in<00:02:12.400> with<00:02:12.579> the

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:12.609 
our plumber roughed this in with the

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.849 
our plumber roughed this in with the
block<00:02:13.030> in<00:02:13.359> because<00:02:13.749> we<00:02:14.200> knew<00:02:14.379> we<00:02:14.560> wouldn't<00:02:14.709> be

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:14.859 
block in because we knew we wouldn't be

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:16.110 
block in because we knew we wouldn't be
able<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.010> put<00:02:15.189> the<00:02:15.280> block<00:02:15.459> on<00:02:15.639> later<00:02:15.909> and<00:02:16.030> we

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
able to put the block on later and we

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.879 
able to put the block on later and we
didn't<00:02:16.359> really<00:02:16.510> want<00:02:16.689> to<00:02:16.780> cut<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.469> block<00:02:17.650> in

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:17.889 
didn't really want to cut the block in

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:18.390 
didn't really want to cut the block in
half<00:02:18.099> and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
half and

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.979 
half and
put<00:02:18.489> it<00:02:18.579> in<00:02:18.700> later<00:02:19.170> so<00:02:20.340> so<00:02:21.340> with<00:02:21.670> the

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
put it in later so so with the

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.630 
put it in later so so with the
assistance<00:02:22.989> of<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:23.230> cider<00:02:23.470> and<00:02:23.739> the<00:02:24.400> plumber

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
assistance of the cider and the plumber

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.539 
assistance of the cider and the plumber
and<00:02:24.790> myself<00:02:25.120> we<00:02:25.540> figured<00:02:25.840> out<00:02:26.189> the<00:02:27.189> depth<00:02:27.430> to

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
and myself we figured out the depth to

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.130 
and myself we figured out the depth to
the<00:02:27.760> back<00:02:27.939> of<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.180> block<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:28.720> so<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.959> back<00:02:29.110> of

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
the back of the block and so the back of

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.960 
the back of the block and so the back of
the<00:02:29.319> block<00:02:29.470> is<00:02:29.739> where<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.040> rain<00:02:30.280> screen<00:02:30.579> is<00:02:30.760> so

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
the block is where the rain screen is so

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.030 
the block is where the rain screen is so
eventually<00:02:31.629> the<00:02:32.019> ciders<00:02:32.349> will<00:02:32.560> be<00:02:32.709> building

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
eventually the ciders will be building

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.149 
eventually the ciders will be building
out<00:02:33.189> behind<00:02:33.549> this<00:02:33.989> what<00:02:34.989> this<00:02:35.170> this<00:02:35.590> leaves<00:02:35.859> us

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
out behind this what this this leaves us

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.660 
out behind this what this this leaves us
able<00:02:36.879> to<00:02:37.120> do<00:02:37.269> is<00:02:37.480> when<00:02:37.629> our<00:02:37.810> weather<00:02:38.709> resistive

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
able to do is when our weather resistive

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.479 
able to do is when our weather resistive
barrier<00:02:40.060> goes<00:02:40.299> on<00:02:40.480> we<00:02:40.689> can<00:02:40.900> actually<00:02:41.349> we<00:02:42.310> like

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
barrier goes on we can actually we like

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:44.819 
barrier goes on we can actually we like
to<00:02:42.640> seal<00:02:42.909> all<00:02:43.480> our<00:02:43.810> penetrations<00:02:44.409> so<00:02:44.560> if<00:02:44.680> any

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
to seal all our penetrations so if any

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:47.039 
to seal all our penetrations so if any
water<00:02:45.099> is<00:02:45.340> coming<00:02:45.640> down<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.909> barrier<00:02:46.269> it

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
water is coming down that barrier it

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.110 
water is coming down that barrier it
bypasses<00:02:47.829> the<00:02:48.159> pipe<00:02:48.370> and<00:02:48.579> keeps<00:02:48.790> going

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
bypasses the pipe and keeps going

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.520 
bypasses the pipe and keeps going
instead<00:02:49.329> of<00:02:49.480> trying<00:02:49.689> to<00:02:49.750> go<00:02:49.900> in<00:02:50.049> the<00:02:50.140> hole<00:02:50.319> that

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
instead of trying to go in the hole that

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.649 
instead of trying to go in the hole that
the<00:02:50.620> pipe<00:02:50.799> creates<00:02:51.209> now<00:02:52.209> if<00:02:52.329> we<00:02:52.450> look<00:02:52.599> down

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:52.659 
the pipe creates now if we look down

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:56.460 
the pipe creates now if we look down
here<00:02:52.840> we<00:02:53.909> can<00:02:54.909> see<00:02:55.090> this<00:02:55.299> is<00:02:55.540> again<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.319> is

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
here we can see this is again this is

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.780 
here we can see this is again this is
our<00:02:56.590> air<00:02:56.769> barrier<00:02:57.159> which<00:02:57.310> we<00:02:57.459> talked<00:02:57.700> about

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
our air barrier which we talked about

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:00.559 
our air barrier which we talked about
quite<00:02:58.239> a<00:02:58.329> bit<00:02:58.420> and<00:02:58.690> how<00:02:59.590> the<00:02:59.650> plumbing

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
quite a bit and how the plumbing

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:03.390 
quite a bit and how the plumbing
penetrates<00:03:01.569> the<00:03:01.750> air<00:03:01.900> barrier<00:03:02.319> and<00:03:02.650> at<00:03:03.189> this

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
penetrates the air barrier and at this

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.690 
penetrates the air barrier and at this
point<00:03:03.639> it's<00:03:03.970> it's<00:03:04.510> just<00:03:04.840> a<00:03:05.430> standard<00:03:06.430> PEX

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
point it's it's just a standard PEX

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.270 
point it's it's just a standard PEX
tubing<00:03:06.849> and<00:03:07.389> what<00:03:07.930> we'll<00:03:08.079> do<00:03:08.230> is<00:03:08.530> we<00:03:08.889> will<00:03:09.040> air

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
tubing and what we'll do is we will air

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.869 
tubing and what we'll do is we will air
seal<00:03:09.659> again<00:03:10.659> with<00:03:10.840> our<00:03:10.989> liquid<00:03:11.260> applied<00:03:12.250> joint

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
seal again with our liquid applied joint

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.059 
seal again with our liquid applied joint
and<00:03:13.000> seam<00:03:13.230> around<00:03:14.230> this<00:03:14.439> to<00:03:14.650> get<00:03:14.769> a<00:03:14.799> really

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
and seam around this to get a really

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:16.619 
and seam around this to get a really
good<00:03:15.220> seal<00:03:15.519> and<00:03:15.549> you<00:03:15.939> know<00:03:16.120> we<00:03:16.239> worked<00:03:16.450> with

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
good seal and you know we worked with

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:18.270 
good seal and you know we worked with
our<00:03:16.750> plumber<00:03:17.019> to<00:03:17.200> make<00:03:17.319> sure<00:03:17.500> that<00:03:17.709> he's

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
our plumber to make sure that he's

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.920 
our plumber to make sure that he's
cutting<00:03:18.579> us<00:03:18.700> nice<00:03:18.909> clean<00:03:19.209> holes<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.810> not

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
cutting us nice clean holes and not

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.300 
cutting us nice clean holes and not
hacking<00:03:20.439> this<00:03:20.530> out<00:03:20.709> with<00:03:20.799> a<00:03:20.889> sawzall<00:03:21.280> or

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
hacking this out with a sawzall or

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:22.770 
hacking this out with a sawzall or
something<00:03:21.760> so<00:03:21.970> some<00:03:22.150> of<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.359> other<00:03:22.540> details

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
something so some of the other details

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.770 
something so some of the other details
we<00:03:23.230> have<00:03:23.260> that<00:03:23.859> are<00:03:24.790> for<00:03:25.060> our<00:03:25.180> plumbing<00:03:25.419> here

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
we have that are for our plumbing here

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.559 
we have that are for our plumbing here
is<00:03:25.959> this<00:03:26.739> is<00:03:26.919> a<00:03:26.949> basically<00:03:27.790> a<00:03:27.879> standard<00:03:28.150> vent

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
is this is a basically a standard vent

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.110 
is this is a basically a standard vent
and<00:03:28.780> it's<00:03:29.709> going<00:03:29.889> up<00:03:30.129> through<00:03:30.669> our<00:03:30.790> top<00:03:30.970> plate

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
and it's going up through our top plate

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.379 
and it's going up through our top plate
and<00:03:31.359> we<00:03:32.139> roughed<00:03:32.410> that<00:03:32.620> in<00:03:32.829> previously<00:03:33.669> so<00:03:34.239> we

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:34.389 
and we roughed that in previously so we

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.860 
and we roughed that in previously so we
could<00:03:34.540> air<00:03:34.750> seal<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:36.430> above<00:03:37.120> there<00:03:37.449> where<00:03:37.840> our

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:37.870 
could air seal the above there where our

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:39.960 
could air seal the above there where our
air<00:03:38.230> barrier<00:03:38.560> comes<00:03:38.739> across<00:03:39.040> so<00:03:39.310> we<00:03:39.340> could<00:03:39.519> air

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
air barrier comes across so we could air

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:43.050 
air barrier comes across so we could air
seal<00:03:40.239> to<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:40.810> vent<00:03:41.500> pipe<00:03:41.769> and<00:03:42.069> that<00:03:42.699> just<00:03:42.909> goes

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
seal to the vent pipe and that just goes

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.550 
seal to the vent pipe and that just goes
through<00:03:43.120> the<00:03:43.480> roof<00:03:43.629> deck<00:03:43.900> like<00:03:44.109> a<00:03:44.139> standard

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
through the roof deck like a standard

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.189 
through the roof deck like a standard
vent<00:03:44.829> a<00:03:45.099> lot<00:03:46.060> of<00:03:46.209> times<00:03:46.419> if<00:03:46.690> we<00:03:46.810> can<00:03:46.959> get<00:03:47.079> away

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:47.199 
vent a lot of times if we can get away

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.869 
vent a lot of times if we can get away
with<00:03:47.470> it<00:03:47.590> we<00:03:47.680> have<00:03:47.709> to<00:03:47.979> have<00:03:48.129> a<00:03:48.159> specific

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
with it we have to have a specific

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:51.479 
with it we have to have a specific
amount<00:03:49.180> of<00:03:49.739> vents<00:03:50.739> going<00:03:50.919> through<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.310> roof

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
amount of vents going through the roof

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.390 
amount of vents going through the roof
to<00:03:51.669> meet<00:03:51.819> plumbing<00:03:52.180> code<00:03:52.359> but<00:03:53.260> another<00:03:53.530> item

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
to meet plumbing code but another item

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.369 
to meet plumbing code but another item
that<00:03:54.579> we<00:03:54.729> use<00:03:54.940> is<00:03:55.239> an<00:03:55.449> air<00:03:55.629> admittance<00:03:56.109> valve

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379 
that we use is an air admittance valve

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:58.409 
that we use is an air admittance valve
or<00:03:56.680> what<00:03:56.859> other<00:03:57.069> people<00:03:57.430> might<00:03:57.639> call<00:03:57.849> a<00:03:57.879> auto

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
or what other people might call a auto

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.469 
or what other people might call a auto
event<00:03:58.900> or<00:03:59.409> a<00:03:59.440> mechanical<00:03:59.919> vent<00:04:00.159> and<00:04:00.430> that<00:04:00.940> is<00:04:01.389> a

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:01.479 
event or a mechanical vent and that is a

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:04.500 
event or a mechanical vent and that is a
one-way<00:04:02.049> valve<00:04:02.129> that<00:04:03.129> when<00:04:03.489> your<00:04:03.940> drain<00:04:04.239> is

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
one-way valve that when your drain is

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.899 
one-way valve that when your drain is
draining<00:04:04.930> it<00:04:05.169> opens<00:04:05.530> up<00:04:05.709> and<00:04:05.919> allows<00:04:06.370> the

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
draining it opens up and allows the

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:10.259 
draining it opens up and allows the
drain<00:04:07.120> to<00:04:07.359> flow<00:04:07.959> by<00:04:08.609> releasing<00:04:09.609> the<00:04:09.879> vacuum

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
drain to flow by releasing the vacuum

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:13.140 
drain to flow by releasing the vacuum
pressure<00:04:10.500> but<00:04:11.500> it<00:04:11.620> doesn't<00:04:11.979> if<00:04:12.430> sewer<00:04:12.849> gases

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
pressure but it doesn't if sewer gases

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.529 
pressure but it doesn't if sewer gases
are<00:04:13.510> coming<00:04:13.659> up<00:04:13.989> it<00:04:14.620> closes<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.519> stays<00:04:16.150> closed

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
are coming up it closes and stays closed

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:18.810 
are coming up it closes and stays closed
if<00:04:16.810> it's<00:04:17.019> not<00:04:17.169> draining<00:04:17.530> and<00:04:18.280> we<00:04:18.430> have<00:04:18.579> one

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:18.820 
if it's not draining and we have one

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.759 
if it's not draining and we have one
over<00:04:19.060> here<00:04:19.239> that<00:04:19.419> we<00:04:19.510> can<00:04:19.659> take<00:04:19.810> a<00:04:19.840> look<00:04:20.019> at<00:04:20.260> so

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
over here that we can take a look at so

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:23.850 
over here that we can take a look at so
instead<00:04:21.070> of<00:04:21.130> take<00:04:21.489> taking<00:04:22.180> this<00:04:22.860> plumbing

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
instead of take taking this plumbing

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.500 
instead of take taking this plumbing
vent<00:04:24.010> all<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.520> way<00:04:24.639> through<00:04:24.909> the<00:04:25.030> roof<00:04:25.240> like

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
vent all the way through the roof like

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.040 
vent all the way through the roof like
you<00:04:26.289> normally<00:04:26.529> would<00:04:27.150> we've<00:04:28.150> we've<00:04:28.719> had<00:04:28.930> our

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
you normally would we've we've had our

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.629 
you normally would we've we've had our
plumber<00:04:29.289> install<00:04:29.710> this<00:04:29.950> air<00:04:30.250> admittance

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
plumber install this air admittance

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.770 
plumber install this air admittance
valve<00:04:30.880> here

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
valve here

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.380 
valve here
and<00:04:31.870> that<00:04:32.530> again<00:04:33.190> like<00:04:33.400> I<00:04:33.520> explained<00:04:33.970> it<00:04:34.210> just

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
and that again like I explained it just

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.810 
and that again like I explained it just
goes<00:04:34.810> in<00:04:35.020> there<00:04:35.170> and<00:04:35.410> allows<00:04:36.280> it<00:04:36.310> to<00:04:36.580> vent

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:36.820 
goes in there and allows it to vent

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.100 
goes in there and allows it to vent
without<00:04:37.030> pennant<00:04:37.600> making<00:04:37.930> anymore

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:38.110 
without pennant making anymore

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.760 
without pennant making anymore
penetrations<00:04:38.890> in<00:04:39.040> our<00:04:39.160> air<00:04:39.340> barrier
