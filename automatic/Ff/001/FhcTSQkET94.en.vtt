00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:07.379
 futurists fiction writers and other dreamers 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.940
 have long been dreaming about connecting 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.740
 car to the Internet for 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.940
 total and and control mode 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.429
 real time 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.650
 there are smart houses must be smart 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.900
 cars but whatâ€™s the story 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.970
 the system is already there and not in prototypes 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.630
 anywhere in Silicon Valley or 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.210
 skolkovo 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.930
 but in real life the scheme of her work is very 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.119
 simple 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.580
 a block of chips the size of a pack of cigarettes 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.800
 clings to the standard connector through 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.230
 which bride technician u connect your 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.780
 diagnostic computer plus this 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.820
 the unit has a gps chip and glonass and 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.510
 actually and connection to a cellular network 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.489
 jetsam 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.250
 Initially, this anti-theft complex 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.559
 more precisely telemetric security system 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.450
 scher-khan universe if that 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.850
 will alert you at any distance with 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.629
 using sms call or email 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.610
 messages 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.690
 but we are interested not so much and and 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.090
 security functions 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.489
 how much control is possible car 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.739
 You can control the system by 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.840
 desktop computer or laptop so 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.790
 and from a smartphone or special unit 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.770
 commander which is set to 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.290
 the car on the screen always shows the last 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.930
 the trip can be seen from where the person left 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.750
 came there as he moved green 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.670
 color corresponds to quiet movements 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:19.470
 yellow movement so yourself red it 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.680
 extension tube speed reduce 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:25.260
 kilometer per hour if desired, and you can 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.050
 other parameters in the same 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:33.090
 video and perception let's say overclocking 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.470
 braking how neat a person is 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.300
 here green color corresponds 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.020
 stable movement normal 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.460
 parameters blue 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.010
 some kind of acceleration acceleration 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.650
 accordingly, if there are sharp accelerations 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.810
 the risk of sudden braking the trade ride 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.700
 will be still painted green in 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.090
 blue or red can be judged 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.740
 driving safety in three others 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:02:00.970
 parameters let's press the brake 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.490
 Irina actor it is clear that when you click on 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.630
 accelerator if there is a lot of dark on 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.040
 on the track 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.470
 it will fit a lot 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.740
 spending a lot of money 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.740
 gasoline 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.610
 10 enviable car condition here 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.570
 it is clear that the latest information came 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.950
 today in 1438 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.540
 the car was on guard and the door 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.220
 the trunk of the facut were closed 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.500
 naturally if here is something right now 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.200
 happen we get this right now 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:33.370
 information if nothing happens to 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.930
 the system updates the information once the panel 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.030
 devices can always see about 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.700
 battery condition temperature in 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.530
 how much fuel is the car 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.269
 Do you need cars tomorrow? 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.900
 refueling or maybe even a week 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.290
 to attempt 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.320
 and the current mileage is very convenient if 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.640
 came to the salon and we need not live 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.190
 report what mileage current 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.980
 and that's what I thought is just 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.470
 the dream of a stern boss or home 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.480
 the tyrant put such a thing in the car 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.520
 wives or girlfriends and everyone arrived 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.830
 you can not get up because of the computer to know 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.930
 where she drives at what speed 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.060
 brakes and accelerates where and how much 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.640
 refueling what happened with the car 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.920
 the error will be displayed, you can decipher it 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.840
 even block the number if desired 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.660
 motor can be directly from your mobile 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.910
 You can even be overheard what they say in 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.830
 salon because beauty is still possible 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:27.290
 analyze your routes and style 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.300
 driving control fuel consumption 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.550
 Well, there are such a bore whom it all 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.040
 very worried or track level 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:36.500
 battery charging will start or not with 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.600
 Morning in the cold is no longer a mystery as they say 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.220
 system developers can connect 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.800
 to almost any car 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.930
 naturally from old women completely deprived 

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.880
 smart electronics a lot of information is not 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.850
 get but what cars are newer 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.769
 the more options will work all 4 5 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:54.230
 yearling cars have the ability 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.510
 connect and naturally you ask about 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.430
 security wo n't get access to 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.400
 your car over the internet somebody 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:03.410
 left and will not start it to manage me too 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.140
 asked the developers about it by the way 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.700
 make the system entirely in Russia 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.890
 claim to be protected on for the same 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.989
 protocol on which banks protect 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.600
 your information and access to our 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:15.170
 mobile cash transactions by the way about 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.750
 the money 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.519
 the system costs a lot and the exact price you need 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.560
 be interested in each 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.630
 car models right in the showrooms 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.970
 authorized dealers but the current one 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.740
 there is no subscription fee to pay 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:31.210
 will have only for Internet traffic 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.210
 about rubles a day 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.270
 new as famous is well forgotten 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.220
 old that's datsun company which 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.170
 recently decided to return to the car 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:45.170
 the world has published a new sketch
