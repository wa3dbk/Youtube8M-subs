 in such a way and it goes there and 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.320
 you already have a dog 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.720

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.400
 azik climb climb climb 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.520
 but there is a lot of space there is such a whole 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.800
 the playground is the only moment for me 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.750
 would certainly like to see that 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.130
 a work of art let's call it that 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.810
 from better fabrics more 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.810
 well overdue because what 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.229
 Apparently well, an inexpensive option it costs 2 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.090
 700 and of course I would like a little bit of it 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.220
 make more advanced but so or 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.520
 otherwise of course such a wonderful thing 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.739
 very comfortable here even have a clothespin 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.360
 for ziko so he did not run away a and 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:16.920
 here we have double wheels in general 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:19.050
 cool I would say the following product 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.390
 who I want to tell you about 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.730
 Here is a backpack Well , firstly, we often 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.620
 travel and take a dog and 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.240
 sometimes you just need somewhere and and 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.340
 place because if you drive on 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.050
 bike or you travel on 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.820
 motorcycle even so here we are for example 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:34.800
 traveling and motorbikes and for me 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.300
 there was a whole story where to put our 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.820
 ziku because we always take it with 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.580
 yourself some kind of such a thing is just 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.190
 find you hang it yourself 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.250
 will I comprehend to the belt from behind and go 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.200
 in the same way you can do it here 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:53.239
 so now i will demonstrate 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:57.680
 how will azik behave there azik 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:03:01.230
 come on come on come on come on come on 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.709
 climb the villins well done here 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.260
 I sat down quietly here with her 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:09.450
 excellent ventilation that can be here 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.489
 so here even open here 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.730
 extra pockets in which something 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:18.500
 you can also put and so here I am 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:21.330
 I fastened myself or vice versa 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.400
 went well or went to the exhibition too 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:26.850
 convenient principle I can not say that it is 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:31.110
 the thing is very necessary but sometimes without it 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:37.650
 simply can not get out to travel 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:40.080
 and another carrying bag 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:43.380
 which I noticed than she 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:46.049
 I liked in general nothing new 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.310
 on the one hand but now what 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:50.180
 manufacturers began to give this 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.970
 there is attention in this bag 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.250

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.959

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.370
 which are inserted here from the side with 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:06.120
 one side the other side of the bag 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.860
 there is a good hard frame for this 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.590
 the bag after that can be put under 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:12.540
 any seat in the plane is very comfortable 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.720

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:18.390

 charms still this bag is convenient because 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.890
 when travel come to 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.430
