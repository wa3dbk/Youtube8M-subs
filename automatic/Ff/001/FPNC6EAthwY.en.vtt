first<00:00:00.659> of<00:00:00.930> all<00:00:01.140> we<00:00:01.800> place<00:00:02.070> the<00:00:02.220> gelatin<00:00:02.790> into

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
first of all we place the gelatin into

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.200 
first of all we place the gelatin into
the<00:00:03.449> water<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:04.170> we<00:00:04.680> rest<00:00:04.950> it<00:00:05.220> for<00:00:05.430> about<00:00:05.790> 5

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
the water and we rest it for about 5

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.080 
the water and we rest it for about 5
minutes<00:00:06.480> during<00:00:07.440> this<00:00:07.710> time<00:00:08.010> what<00:00:08.280> we<00:00:08.490> do<00:00:08.670> is

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
minutes during this time what we do is

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.570 
minutes during this time what we do is
to<00:00:09.300> blow<00:00:09.510> up<00:00:09.540> some<00:00:09.990> balloons<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:11.160> blow<00:00:11.400> up<00:00:11.429> the

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
to blow up some balloons we blow up the

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.020 
to blow up some balloons we blow up the
balloons<00:00:12.240> in<00:00:12.509> littles<00:00:13.139> first<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:14.219> we<00:00:14.730> tie<00:00:15.000> a

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
balloons in littles first and we tie a

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.300 
balloons in littles first and we tie a
knot<00:00:15.330> in<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:16.049> balloons<00:00:17.690> if<00:00:18.690> we<00:00:18.990> worked<00:00:19.289> we<00:00:20.070> can

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
knot in the balloons if we worked we can

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.800 
knot in the balloons if we worked we can
place<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.699> stick<00:00:21.270> in<00:00:21.539> the<00:00:21.750> balloon<00:00:22.560> after<00:00:23.279> day

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
place a stick in the balloon after day

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:29.750 
place a stick in the balloon after day
not<00:00:25.279> for<00:00:26.279> dried<00:00:27.119> later<00:00:27.810> hours<00:00:28.680> first<00:00:29.039> easier

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
not for dried later hours first easier

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.790 
not for dried later hours first easier
you<00:00:30.630> will<00:00:30.660> see<00:00:31.019> how<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.650> place<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.790> dry<00:00:33.800> then

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you will see how we place it to dry then

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.049 
you will see how we place it to dry then
as<00:00:35.100> we<00:00:35.880> realize<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.840> gelatin<00:00:37.559> with<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.730> cold

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
as we realize the gelatin with the cold

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.280 
as we realize the gelatin with the cold
water<00:00:39.270> now<00:00:40.050> it's<00:00:40.800> okay<00:00:41.250> is<00:00:42.180> a<00:00:42.239> sponge<00:00:42.809> is

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
water now it's okay is a sponge is

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.100 
water now it's okay is a sponge is
something<00:00:43.920> thick<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:45.030> we<00:00:45.239> can<00:00:45.450> place<00:00:45.750> it<00:00:45.780> in

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
something thick and we can place it in

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.930 
something thick and we can place it in
the<00:00:46.320> microwave<00:00:48.770> we<00:00:49.770> place<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.219> in<00:00:50.340> microwave

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
the microwave we place it in microwave

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.000 
the microwave we place it in microwave
for<00:00:50.969> about<00:00:51.270> 5<00:00:52.199> seconds<00:00:52.890> 10<00:00:53.280> seconds<00:00:55.010> the

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
for about 5 seconds 10 seconds the

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.240 
for about 5 seconds 10 seconds the
gelatin<00:00:56.520> has<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.850> be<00:00:57.289> thin<00:00:58.289> and<00:01:00.109> we<00:01:01.109> place<00:01:01.410> some

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
gelatin has to be thin and we place some

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.929 
gelatin has to be thin and we place some
pearl<00:01:02.789> dust<00:01:03.290> in<00:01:04.290> our<00:01:04.470> mix<00:01:06.979> we<00:01:07.979> place<00:01:08.280> pearl

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
pearl dust in our mix we place pearl

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.820 
pearl dust in our mix we place pearl
because<00:01:09.950> we<00:01:10.950> want<00:01:11.220> our<00:01:11.369> first<00:01:11.850> beep<00:01:12.409> shining

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:15.830 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.490 

now<00:01:17.750> we<00:01:18.750> change<00:01:19.610> our<00:01:20.610> gelatin<00:01:21.360> our<00:01:21.630> jello<00:01:22.110> in

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
now we change our gelatin our jello in

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.780 
now we change our gelatin our jello in
another<00:01:23.070> poll<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.759> work<00:01:24.299> in<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> process<00:01:25.790> we

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
another poll I work in the process we

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.160 
another poll I work in the process we
take<00:01:26.970> out<00:01:27.270> all<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.350> little<00:01:29.990> pieces<00:01:30.990> of

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
take out all the little pieces of

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.190 
take out all the little pieces of
gelatin<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:31.829> could<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.490> our<00:01:32.880> mix<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.570> now

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
gelatin that could be in our mix and now

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.730 
gelatin that could be in our mix and now
we<00:01:34.650> begin<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:35.340> process<00:01:37.310> with<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.490> clean<00:01:38.759> mix

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
we begin the process with the clean mix

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.840 
we begin the process with the clean mix
then<00:01:40.740> we<00:01:41.579> take<00:01:41.850> little<00:01:42.450> balloons<00:01:43.070> and<00:01:44.070> we

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
then we take little balloons and we

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.069 
then we take little balloons and we
place<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.390> all<00:01:46.399> over<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:48.210> mix<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:49.920> can<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:51.079> we

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
place it all over the mix you can see we

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.740 
place it all over the mix you can see we
do<00:01:52.229> it<00:01:52.350> four<00:01:53.159> times<00:01:53.189> we<00:01:53.909> need<00:01:54.090> three<00:01:54.509> or<00:01:54.659> four

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
do it four times we need three or four

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.459 
do it four times we need three or four
or<00:01:55.820> four<00:01:56.820> coats<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:58.469> mix<00:01:59.090> hmm<00:02:00.170> once<00:02:01.170> we

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
or four coats of the mix hmm once we

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.910 
or four coats of the mix hmm once we
make<00:02:01.710> one<00:02:02.219> coat<00:02:02.780> we<00:02:03.780> let<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.259> balloon<00:02:04.590> dry<00:02:04.890> a

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
make one coat we let the balloon dry a

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.199 
make one coat we let the balloon dry a
little<00:02:05.270> and<00:02:06.270> once<00:02:06.509> is<00:02:06.899> dry<00:02:07.170> we<00:02:08.039> place<00:02:08.429> another

little and once is dry we place another

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:19.069 
little and once is dry we place another
code<00:02:14.000> we<00:02:15.000> still<00:02:15.390> mix<00:02:17.239> people<00:02:18.239> make<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.870> other

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:19.079 
code we still mix people make the other

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:30.400 
code we still mix people make the other
code

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.260 

if<00:02:30.950> we<00:02:31.250> think<00:02:31.640> that<00:02:31.850> our<00:02:32.060> mix<00:02:32.750> has<00:02:33.200> been<00:02:34.270> very

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
if we think that our mix has been very

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.740 
if we think that our mix has been very
very<00:02:35.510> thick<00:02:35.930> what<00:02:36.860> we<00:02:37.100> do<00:02:37.310> is<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:38.060> place<00:02:38.360> again

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
very thick what we do is to place again

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
form we can use also some silicon that

form we can use also some silicon that
is<00:03:33.350> easier<00:03:33.920> than<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.340> balloons<00:03:34.640> but<00:03:35.030> okay<00:03:35.540> not

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
the better thing is to use little

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.760 
the better thing is to use little
scissors<00:04:15.880> to<00:04:16.880> make<00:04:17.090> a<00:04:17.120> little<00:04:17.480> hole<00:04:17.960> in<00:04:18.530> the

ours first it is not important at all we
are<00:05:05.740> making<00:05:05.980> because<00:05:06.580> later<00:05:07.030> on<00:05:07.180> we<00:05:07.450> will

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:07.600 
are making because later on we will

place those a little Spurs in in cakes
we<00:05:17.440> will<00:05:17.650> use<00:05:17.860> some<00:05:18.130> icing<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:19.720> is<00:05:19.900> not<00:05:20.200> a<00:05:20.230> good

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:20.440 
we will use some icing it is not a good

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:25.130 
we will use some icing it is not a good
idea<00:05:20.590> to<00:05:21.810> place<00:05:22.810> water<00:05:23.080> on<00:05:23.470> the<00:05:23.700> first

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
idea to place water on the first

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:28.020 
idea to place water on the first
gelatine<00:05:26.140> doesn't<00:05:26.530> like<00:05:26.650> water<00:05:26.919> if<00:05:27.610> we<00:05:27.790> want

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030 
gelatine doesn't like water if we want

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:30.150 
gelatine doesn't like water if we want
to<00:05:28.180> paint<00:05:28.419> them<00:05:28.690> it<00:05:29.230> is<00:05:29.410> possible<00:05:29.800> to<00:05:29.830> do<00:05:30.100> it

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 
to paint them it is possible to do it

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.650 
to paint them it is possible to do it
but<00:05:30.460> use<00:05:30.760> some<00:05:31.260> alcohol<00:05:32.260> not<00:05:32.890> water<00:05:33.660> not

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
but use some alcohol not water not

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.260

edible<00:05:35.200> colors<00:05:35.740> with<00:05:35.980> water<00:05:36.220> this<00:05:36.970> is<00:05:37.120> the

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
edible colors with water this is the

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.430 
edible colors with water this is the
result<00:05:38.100> can<00:05:39.100> you<00:05:39.250> see<00:05:39.370> the<00:05:39.490> different<00:05:39.820> colors

result can you see the different colors

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:44.220 
result can you see the different colors
once<00:05:41.440> we<00:05:42.430> have<00:05:42.580> made<00:05:42.850> it<00:05:43.030> with<00:05:43.390> white<00:05:43.870> color

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:44.230
