out behind the enemy lines preferably so

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.179 
out behind the enemy lines preferably so
my<00:01:12.510> teammates<00:01:12.900> could<00:01:13.020> spawn<00:01:13.320> on<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.830> i

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
my teammates could spawn on it and i

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.590 
my teammates could spawn on it and i
would<00:01:14.310> also<00:01:14.430> get<00:01:14.670> my<00:01:14.790> mouth<00:01:15.030> out<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.479> just

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
how i got it now you could probably just

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.399 
how i got it now you could probably just
boost<00:01:21.000> this<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.540> get<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.720> teammate<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.229> die

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
boost this just get a teammate to die

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.109

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
and and spot stuff and stuff but I just

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.969 
and and spot stuff and stuff but I just
did<00:01:27.000> it<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.720> one<00:01:27.990> match<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.380> damnation<00:01:28.590> it

did it in like one match of damnation it

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.469 
did it in like one match of damnation it
didn't<00:01:29.280> really<00:01:29.400> take<00:01:29.520> too<00:01:29.759> much<00:01:29.880> time<00:01:30.210> and

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
didn't really take too much time and

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.510 
didn't really take too much time and
shouldn't<00:01:31.079> be<00:01:31.140> too<00:01:31.320> hard<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.560> do<00:01:31.890> but<00:01:32.220> without

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
shouldn't be too hard to do but without

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.880

so you can go ahead and check it out

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.660 
so you can go ahead and check it out
yourself<00:01:41.970> from<00:01:42.390> simply<00:01:42.869> calm<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:44.159> first<00:01:44.460> off

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
yourself from simply calm but first off

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.789 
yourself from simply calm but first off
looking<00:01:44.970> at<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.149> damage<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.689> starts<00:01:46.170> on<00:01:46.320> 100

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
looking at the damage it starts on 100

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.830 
looking at the damage it starts on 100
and<00:01:46.950> drops<00:01:47.159> down<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> 59<00:01:47.909> after<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> hundred

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
and drops down to 59 after a hundred

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.830 
and drops down to 59 after a hundred
meters<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:50.430> got<00:01:50.579> some<00:01:50.759> mathematics<00:01:51.450> stuff

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
meters and we got some mathematics stuff

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.789 
meters and we got some mathematics stuff
showing<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.439> drop<00:01:52.680> off<00:01:52.860> yeah<00:01:53.869> gravity<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.140> um

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
showing the drop off yeah gravity so um

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.950 
showing the drop off yeah gravity so um
it<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.280> also<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.610> fastest<00:01:57.299> firing<00:01:57.689> sniper

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it is also the fastest firing sniper

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.249 
it is also the fastest firing sniper
rifle<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.350> believe<00:01:58.649> with<00:01:59.159> a<00:01:59.189> 63<00:02:00.060> RPM<00:02:00.329> which<00:02:01.079> is

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
rifle I believe with a 63 RPM which is

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:02.929 
rifle I believe with a 63 RPM which is
which<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.680> fairly<00:02:01.920> fast<00:02:02.280> and<00:02:02.490> I<00:02:02.549> makes<00:02:02.759> it

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
which is fairly fast and I makes it

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.179 
which is fairly fast and I makes it
probably<00:02:03.810> one<00:02:03.960> of<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.200> better<00:02:04.380> sniper<00:02:04.740> rifles

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
probably one of the better sniper rifles

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.340 
probably one of the better sniper rifles
on<00:02:05.340> close<00:02:05.700> range<00:02:06.119> which<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:06.750> will<00:02:06.960> have<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> look

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
on close range which we will have a look

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.460 
on close range which we will have a look
at<00:02:07.500> later<00:02:07.799> it<00:02:08.310> has<00:02:08.520> a<00:02:08.550> velocity<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.390> 400<00:02:10.140> meters

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
at later it has a velocity of 400 meters

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.820 
at later it has a velocity of 400 meters
a<00:02:10.500> second<00:02:11.099> and<00:02:11.310> three

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:11.830 
a second and three

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.860 
a second and three
vanitas<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.340> second<00:02:12.910> if<00:02:13.060> you're<00:02:13.330> used<00:02:13.630> to<00:02:13.750> get

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
vanitas a second if you're used to get

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.410 
vanitas a second if you're used to get
suppressed<00:02:14.320> so<00:02:14.800> I<00:02:14.830> this<00:02:15.580> gun<00:02:15.910> is<00:02:15.940> not<00:02:16.210> very

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
suppressed so I this gun is not very

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.000 
suppressed so I this gun is not very
good<00:02:16.480> at<00:02:16.660> long<00:02:16.930> range<00:02:17.200> I<00:02:17.410> think<00:02:17.590> that's<00:02:17.740> pretty

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
good at long range I think that's pretty

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.370 
good at long range I think that's pretty
self<00:02:18.490> explained<00:02:19.180> now<00:02:19.780> looking<00:02:20.020> at<00:02:20.110> a<00:02:20.170> magazine

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
self explained now looking at a magazine

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.470 
self explained now looking at a magazine
size<00:02:20.950> its<00:02:21.220> fellows<00:02:21.460> standard<00:02:22.030> you<00:02:22.120> have<00:02:22.240> ten

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
size its fellows standard you have ten

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:24.300 
size its fellows standard you have ten
bullets<00:02:22.660> plus<00:02:23.080> one<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.560> five<00:02:24.070> magazines

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
bullets plus one and five magazines

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.540 
bullets plus one and five magazines
which<00:02:24.970> should<00:02:25.150> be<00:02:25.330> enough<00:02:25.570> and<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.950> think<00:02:27.100> this

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
which should be enough and I think this

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.130 
which should be enough and I think this
gun<00:02:27.790> is<00:02:27.820> fairly<00:02:28.120> good<00:02:28.360> and<00:02:28.480> close<00:02:28.630> range<00:02:28.960> but

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
gun is fairly good and close range but

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.540 
gun is fairly good and close range but
we'll<00:02:29.320> have<00:02:29.410> a<00:02:29.470> look<00:02:29.590> at<00:02:29.740> the<00:02:29.830> load<00:02:30.040> right

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
we'll have a look at the load right

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.700 
we'll have a look at the load right
about<00:02:30.760> now<00:02:31.090> now<00:02:31.630> regarding<00:02:32.140> the<00:02:32.260> loadouts

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:32.710 
about now now regarding the loadouts

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.620 
about now now regarding the loadouts
I've<00:02:32.950> got<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.220> fairly<00:02:33.700> standard<00:02:34.030> aggressive

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
I've got a fairly standard aggressive

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.570 
I've got a fairly standard aggressive
recon<00:02:34.810> loadout<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.500> that<00:02:35.620> would<00:02:35.740> be<00:02:35.770> the<00:02:36.010> 6x

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
recon loadout and that would be the 6x

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.640 
recon loadout and that would be the 6x
scope<00:02:36.940> this<00:02:37.420> red<00:02:37.660> bull<00:02:37.900> bolt<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:38.320> the<00:02:38.410> laser

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
scope this red bull bolt and the laser

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.740 
scope this red bull bolt and the laser
sight<00:02:39.010> now<00:02:39.280> this<00:02:39.490> is<00:02:39.670> what<00:02:39.850> I<00:02:39.880> pretty<00:02:40.630> much

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
sight now this is what I pretty much

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.780 
sight now this is what I pretty much
always<00:02:40.990> used<00:02:41.440> but<00:02:41.620> having<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:42.010> laser<00:02:42.220> sight<00:02:42.490> for

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
always used but having a laser sight for

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.090 
always used but having a laser sight for
the<00:02:42.820> cs5<00:02:43.390> sniper<00:02:43.690> rifle<00:02:43.990> is<00:02:44.140> fairly<00:02:44.440> effective

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
the cs5 sniper rifle is fairly effective

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.920 
the cs5 sniper rifle is fairly effective
because<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:45.790> already<00:02:45.970> have<00:02:46.210> a<00:02:46.390> really<00:02:46.810> good

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
because you already have a really good

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.690 
because you already have a really good

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
hip fires putting on a laser sight is

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.520 
hip fires putting on a laser sight is
gonna<00:02:48.940> it's<00:02:49.420> gonna<00:02:49.480> make<00:02:49.690> it<00:02:49.840> amazing<00:02:50.110> now

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
gonna it's gonna make it amazing now

gonna it's gonna make it amazing now
keep<00:02:50.770> in<00:02:50.890> mind<00:02:50.950> using<00:02:51.459> this<00:02:51.580> gun<00:02:51.880> on

long-range<00:02:52.390> it's<00:02:52.930> just<00:02:53.440> not<00:02:53.470> gonna<00:02:53.680> work<00:02:53.770> it's

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
long-range it's just not gonna work it's

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.860 
long-range it's just not gonna work it's
like<00:02:54.310> it's<00:02:54.640> like<00:02:54.700> eating<00:02:55.000> rice<00:02:55.420> with
