00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
blending could be a problem they are a

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.700 
blending could be a problem they are a
bit<00:01:42.299> like<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.479> Bobbi<00:01:42.720> Brown<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:43.170> terms<00:01:43.380> of<00:01:43.530> the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
they lay very well but some of the

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.289 
they lay very well but some of the
blending<00:01:45.840> became<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.229> little<00:01:46.439> bit<00:01:46.560> problematic

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299
