00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.219 
just the quali up this image isn't the
best<00:01:34.060> but<00:01:34.180> i<00:01:34.299> think<00:01:34.600> that<00:01:34.659> the<00:01:34.810> total<00:01:35.110> to

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
best but i think that the total to

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.620 
best but i think that the total to
disposer<00:01:35.590> is<00:01:35.860> all<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.220> times<00:01:36.490> so<00:01:37.000> its<00:01:37.180> BM<00:01:37.600> its

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
disposer is all the times so its BM its

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.600 
disposer is all the times so its BM its
between<00:01:37.930> a<00:01:38.049> black<00:01:38.350> ops<00:01:38.590> 1<00:01:38.680> and<00:01:39.009> black<00:01:39.280> ops<00:01:39.490> 2
