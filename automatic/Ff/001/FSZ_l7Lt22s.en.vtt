00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Ladies and gentlemen, today at the edge of Kunnas

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
A genuine ironman

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Esko Ketola, 71 year old music teacher

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and a powerlifter

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The world's strongest 70 year old

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Here's the squat. A world record. Which improved

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
by 42,5 kilograms

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Bench, went poorly. Didn't break a record.
Gonna fix that

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Deadlift, 200 kilograms. Improved by 10 kilos.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Total amount 535 kilograms

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Improved by 55 kilos

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And this year goal is 600 in Hungary
in the autumn. That's the goal

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Which one is more important - music or iron?

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Both! I drown my sorrows and rejoice with music

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Lifting and music are equally important. 
I refuse to have one without the other

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Why in the fug do you lift outside?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Because of tighter sets, better oxygen levels,
and people have also invented clothes

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
(very natural laughing)

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
You should cover your head
-But I have this hoodie

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
All right then

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
First you got to have tough pressure--

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
How important is this to you?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It's so important that I feel I am doing my life's work

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Good work which I enjoy -
and I help this young group

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
What do they give you?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Solidarity and counter-love
That's what we have!

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Warmth

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000
There you go!
-Ungh!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
(cheerful nigger jazz is being played)

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000
[Music teacher]

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000

[Four time world champion]

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
["Social youth worker"]

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
What is the coldest temperature where you've ever lifted?

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Minus 28 degrees celsius

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.000
With your mittens on. Works perfectly

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Yleisradio. SeinÃ¤joki. Welcome to this live broadcast

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Of world record attempt at deadlifting

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Man over 70 years old, Esko Ketola

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
202 and half kilograms during basic training season. 
Can he lift it?

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Most thrilling moment of sports

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
in 2013. Let's see how it goes

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
It is minus 8 degrees celsius. Ketola starts lifting!

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.000
(asshat reporter starts screaming gibberish)

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
He is dizzy but he did it!

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000
Yeah it went fine.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Are you losing conciousness?

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Nope but almost.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Pecs and shoulders are aching

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
I outdid myself

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But that weight is going up in Hungary also

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000
For sure. I get to train all summer.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Now you can front?
-Now I can front

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
(talking to kitty) That's a good boy

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
This powerlifting hobby. You are going to continue?
Cradle to grave?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
As long as I can lift. I hope I'll be doing this when I am 80.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
I'll stop when I can only lift a broom handle
Then I'll lift less.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
(more happy nigger jazz)
