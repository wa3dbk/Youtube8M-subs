00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
gold edition but like we saw with the GM

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.609 
gold edition but like we saw with the GM
apex<00:01:28.619> two<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.890> three<00:01:30.229> barely<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.380> hitting

apex two and three barely one hitting
the<00:01:31.710> ball<00:01:31.890> there's<00:01:32.340> just<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.640> ton<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.850> milk<00:01:33.150> it's

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.420 
the ball there's just a ton of milk it's
got<00:01:33.479> a<00:01:33.509> really<00:01:33.750> nice<00:01:33.960> sound<00:01:34.350> and<00:01:34.860> you

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
got a really nice sound and you

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.109 
got a really nice sound and you
certainly<00:01:35.700> won't<00:01:36.150> go<00:01:36.450> wrong<00:01:37.040> bind<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.369> SS

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
certainly won't go wrong bind the SS

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.390 
certainly won't go wrong bind the SS
super<00:01:39.450> hero<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:39.930> if<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.200> don't<00:01:40.380> perhaps<00:01:40.799> have

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
super hero so if you don't perhaps have

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.830 
super hero so if you don't perhaps have
big<00:01:41.700> budgets<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:42.240> some<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.600> other<00:01:42.750> guys

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
big budgets of some of the other guys

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.270 
big budgets of some of the other guys
but<00:01:43.229> you're<00:01:43.409> still<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> top<00:01:43.890> quality

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
but you're still the top quality

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.429 
but you're still the top quality
cricketer<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.729> you<00:01:45.390> still<00:01:45.720> want<00:01:45.960> something

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
cricketer and you still want something

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.380
