00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:14.309
 hello to you all for and today I wanted 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.650
 would tell you a little about such a game 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:22.350
 like a little big planet 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.769
 this is the first part of this wonderful 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.369
 franchise as you know the other day came out a 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.329
 More precisely yesterday in Europe came the third part 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:36.600
 But for now I have no hand 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:40.050
 hands lower to this third part I decided 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.980
 tell you about the first part let's 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.030
 run it 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.690
 the game is very cool it positions itself 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.750
 as 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.940
 arcade action arcade something like this 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.000
 She is considered one of the best games on ps3 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:01.199
 and I think that's right and 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.080
 deserved because here all the cool 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:09.270
 and graphics and physics how fast she is 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.810
 good and gameplay and sound the same 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.990
 for example, the well-known site stopgame.ru 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.439
 In his reviews, he inserted music with 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.710
 this game if there planets but 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:26.189
 directly the game itself so smile 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:29.100
 Hail can be me and play up to four 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.229
 man rear computer for one 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.060
 game console 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:36.150
 here or on a local network too soon 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.500
 all that up to 4 people so I already 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.479
 practically passed this wonderful 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.040
 the game 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:46.680
 I would like to show you one of the missions 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:51.979
 let the savanna there there is a kingdom 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:56.640
 meerkat play boot enough 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.170
 many excuse me of course but how is she but 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.750
 real time can't connect both 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.020
 the prefix works in general so that 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.430
 so here you are 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.880
 were level there is such a note 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.450
 great menu stuff you can 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.660
 the appearance of the characters for example change 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:19.650
 like this and this way 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:23.739
 let 's say this is also possible in different ways 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:29.410
 dress up here materials here head 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:32.010
 heaps of heaps here we see there pants and 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.660
 cowards and things like that is 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:38.190
 really everything is very very funny and 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:41.350
 nice and wonderful and all that 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.480
 play and spent man who 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.200
 need to save the world there blah blah blah well all 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.630
 according to the standard than the chip of this game yet 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.590
 very interesting the fact that it is very and 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.720
 very cool level editor that is 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.299
 you can really create your own cards 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.090
 playing me with friends is gonna be fun and 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:06.970
 interesting and very cool as he 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:09.700
 supports running the air let's say 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.940
 so gyroscope still call so look 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.459
 Here we look at the joystick for a gram 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:18.760
 op-op-op-op see he talk i'm no 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.430
 here we do not push the buttons so I chat 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.790
 that is, supporting the gyro can 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.000
 change the face he is joyful about he 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.450
 no longer joyful pull handles 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.100
 have fun really 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:37.810
 the first impression of this game is that she 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:40.269
 child's a fig like that I almost 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:43.209
 know the shadow call and played this game to everyone 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:45.549
 she likes with a girlfriend with friends 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.400
 constantly playing we go through here 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.359
 very very interesting looking forward 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.459
 3 parts 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:52.590
 I repeat once again she has already come out but to 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.860
 sorry to me she 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.720
 did not get here as soon as it appears 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.590
 Immediately take off on her review it is by the way 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:03.599
 goes both to ps3 and ps4 to ps4 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.379
 it will be clear business better graphics so 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:11.190
 In principle, the same thing looked comparison 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:17.430
 t4 version ps3 no difference besides 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:21.750
 what again I repeat different graphics no 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.210
 really very cool game to everyone 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.550
 advice who has a console and he's in 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.000
 by some miracle a friend didn't play her well i 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.100
 I think that these people are very, very few 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.020
 Well what a miss it is the same 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.440
 that not to lose eye too for strength 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:39.300
 gran turismo 6 these games are comparable like 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.790
 still consider us kind of like a child 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.850
 at home but she is very fascinating and 

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.450
 interesting and we definitely will not soon forget 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.400
 she also has such a thing 

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:52.289
 good as replayability i mean 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.449
 You can take place several times the one 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:57.320
 same level and at least earn 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:00.900
 more touch points and generally interesting 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:03.419
 go through what you used to suffer 

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:05.630
 I can not come now everything is fine 

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.630
 it turns out 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.160
 Well, in general, something like this 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.860
 write comments who played this game 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.140
 how did you like it did not like 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.940
