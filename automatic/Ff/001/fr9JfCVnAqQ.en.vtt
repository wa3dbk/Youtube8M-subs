00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.759
 Let's start a little bit now about 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.529
 recovery tactic on the court 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.300
 for who is starting to play tennis 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.080
 is this is a hint more 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.080
 beginners 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.710
 Do you count playing match with someone? 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.640
 tried to explain the points then win 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.730
 The dots 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.710
 As I said the important thing is you. 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.800
 play ball where it's where it does not have 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.240
 No one you threw a ball in 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.710
 left his opponent was in the 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.269
 left near the ball and will try to 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.550
 play on the right 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.809
 If you have much on the right you will have 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.730
 that play on the left you go 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.790
 try to make him move 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.230
 Ok if you have a little bit until it came 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.469
 that until a ball appears a little more 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.120
 easy you can set the point or give 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.390
 a ball a little more difficult to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.390
 he 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.110
 if you have a friend a little bit 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.910
 better get a little bit more 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.739
 ball control there you can already think 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.850
 what is in putting the ball on the side that 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.070
 he has a little more difficulty of 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.619
 hit or left 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.590
 depending on where you are in the right 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.390
 just do not throw all the balls of that 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.729
 place that is wrong because he 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.890
 begins to realize and begins to do what 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.420
 already starts to run away from that ball to 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.320
 keep beating politicians right 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.820
 which is not weak 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.830
 if you start playing all the ball in the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.500
 left all ball on the left it goes 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.150
 start getting more here on the left and 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.430
 will start to return the ball and you will not 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.299
 will have both player control the ball 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.329
 on the right 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.700
 So, what do we do for you? 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.880
 example for example 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.470
 I gave him the weakest left and you 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.680
 want to force his left, he is 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.649
 running from the left to hit the ball is 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.210
 here in the middle of the 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.890
 block you want it hit the 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.720
 left only that he is fleeing to 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.009
 hit heat you can not 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.810
 a good left 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.240
 I think it's getting a little one side there 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.070
 you are not able to put the ball there the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.979
 what do you do you'll have to play a 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.020
 ball on the right he comes here hit the 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.860
 ball right there he opened the court of the 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.479
 left side 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.659
 then you can play any 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:09.060
 The ball you played fell to his left. 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.390
 so be warned is a tactical way of 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.740
 you do is get the ball in the 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.290
 left when he was running away 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.810
 you play the ball on his right you 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.820
 plays two balls on the right and the third 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.580
 time you play on the left you mean not 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.350
 gets once the legal discharge throws 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.970
 a ball on his right here 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.590
 then any ball that plays more 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.730
 there was in that left beating that 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.230
 will not be able to run away hit 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.110
 left 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.740
 so this would be a zany tactic 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.990
 simple for beginners 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:42.450
 play ball at the point you're missing 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.460
 only if he will realize it then the 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.220
 What do you do for you? 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.920
 bypass and not fail to notice plays 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.690
 ball at his strong point for him to arrive 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.780
 the ball and the weak side is opened is 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:03:02.490
 Wanna hit the ball, it's good, it's transfer
