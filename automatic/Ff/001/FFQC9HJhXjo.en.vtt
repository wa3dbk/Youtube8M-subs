that<00:01:32.570> got<00:01:33.570> a<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:34.259> closer<00:01:34.619> for<00:01:34.890> that

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.160 
that got a little closer for that

the glass other whoo
you

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.380 

they<00:01:45.530> say<00:01:45.740> this<00:01:45.979> is<00:01:46.130> the<00:01:46.159> best<00:01:46.390> termination

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
they say this is the best termination

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.030 
they say this is the best termination
out<00:01:47.540> there<00:01:47.810> soldering<00:01:48.409> there's<00:01:48.770> nothing

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
out there soldering there's nothing

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.370 
out there soldering there's nothing
better<00:01:49.190> than<00:01:49.280> soldering<00:01:50.260> soldering<00:01:51.260> the

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
better than soldering soldering the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.870 
better than soldering soldering the
terminal<00:01:51.920> with<00:01:52.130> the<00:01:52.220> cable<00:01:52.640> four<00:01:53.060> gauge<00:01:53.330> cable
