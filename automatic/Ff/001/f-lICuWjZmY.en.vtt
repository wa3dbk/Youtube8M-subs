00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
and cons you know obviously there's very

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.400 
and cons you know obviously there's very
good<00:02:17.030> data<00:02:17.330> to<00:02:17.420> look<00:02:17.660> at<00:02:17.840> but<00:02:18.110> on<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.290> same

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
good data to look at but on the same

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:20.380 
good data to look at but on the same
token<00:02:18.620> it's<00:02:18.950> you<00:02:19.670> know<00:02:19.760> you<00:02:19.850> always<00:02:19.970> have<00:02:20.180> to

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
token it's you know you always have to

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.360 
token it's you know you always have to
race<00:02:20.750> a<00:02:21.020> teammate<00:02:21.380> different<00:02:21.740> like<00:02:21.830> to<00:02:22.010> my

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
race a teammate different like to my

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.470 
race a teammate different like to my
competitor<00:02:22.730> because<00:02:22.910> you<00:02:23.030> know<00:02:23.090> if<00:02:23.180> you<00:02:23.270> crash

with<00:02:23.660> your<00:02:23.750> teammate<00:02:24.080> you<00:02:24.310> you<00:02:25.310> can't<00:02:25.520> get<00:02:25.670> a

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
with your teammate you you can't get a

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.360 
with your teammate you you can't get a
lot<00:02:25.880> of<00:02:25.970> trouble<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:26.480> it's<00:02:27.230> uh<00:02:27.410> we<00:02:28.190> haven't

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
lot of trouble so it's uh we haven't

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.170 
lot of trouble so it's uh we haven't
have<00:02:28.459> to<00:02:28.550> come<00:02:28.700> to<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:28.820> yet<00:02:29.380> but<00:02:30.380> uh<00:02:30.880> fancy<00:02:31.880> I

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
have to come to that yet but uh fancy I

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.210 
have to come to that yet but uh fancy I
mean<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.450> think<00:02:32.510> it's<00:02:33.290> it's<00:02:33.680> definitely<00:02:33.800> it's

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
mean I think it's it's definitely it's

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.680 
mean I think it's it's definitely it's
different<00:02:34.520> than<00:02:34.730> fighting<00:02:35.120> another<00:02:35.420> driver

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
different than fighting another driver

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.100 
different than fighting another driver
but<00:02:35.959> it<00:02:36.170> definitely<00:02:36.320> has<00:02:36.709> its<00:02:36.860> pros<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:37.070> cons

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
but it definitely has its pros and cons

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.220 
but it definitely has its pros and cons
wow<00:02:39.110> we're<00:02:39.470> sending<00:02:39.680> same<00:02:40.660> we<00:02:41.660> obviously<00:02:41.780> have

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
wow we're sending same we obviously have

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.490

bad cat we have a bad cat together so we

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.770 
bad cat we have a bad cat together so we
have<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.220> fight<00:02:52.430> with<00:02:52.610> the<00:02:52.640> same<00:02:52.910> exactly<00:02:53.690> the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
same girl so that makes everything even

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.920 
same girl so that makes everything even
more<00:02:56.299> little<00:02:56.959> tighter<00:02:57.170> so<00:02:58.570> even<00:02:59.570> a<00:02:59.630> bit<00:02:59.780> more

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
more little tighter so even a bit more

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.930 
more little tighter so even a bit more
to<00:03:00.110> ascend<00:03:00.410> and<00:03:00.650> what<00:03:01.519> I<00:03:01.549> think<00:03:01.850> you<00:03:01.910> should

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
to ascend and what I think you should

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.850 
to ascend and what I think you should
ask<00:03:02.209> this<00:03:02.390> question<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.780> try<00:03:03.080> for<00:03:03.140> example<00:03:03.470> a

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:03.860 
ask this question to try for example a

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.930 
ask this question to try for example a
cat's<00:03:04.070> paw<00:03:05.049> so<00:03:06.049> he<00:03:06.170> was<00:03:06.470> losing<00:03:06.680> his<00:03:06.830> hair<00:03:07.900> so<00:03:08.900> I

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
cat's paw so he was losing his hair so I

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.949 
cat's paw so he was losing his hair so I
don't<00:03:10.940> know<00:03:11.000> maybe<00:03:11.150> that's<00:03:11.450> in<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.780> end<00:03:11.870> of

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
don't know maybe that's in the end of

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.259 
don't know maybe that's in the end of
the<00:03:12.049> season<00:03:12.380> but<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:13.010> far<00:03:13.220> we<00:03:13.459> have<00:03:14.120> any

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
the season but so far we have any

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.150 
the season but so far we have any
program<00:03:14.600> on<00:03:14.750> everything<00:03:15.470> one<00:03:15.620> really<00:03:15.950> really

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
program on everything one really really

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.300 
program on everything one really really
good<00:03:16.959> obviously<00:03:17.959> it's<00:03:18.080> even<00:03:18.530> easier<00:03:18.980> for<00:03:19.190> us

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
good obviously it's even easier for us

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:21.069 
good obviously it's even easier for us
to<00:03:19.580> prepare<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:20.299> care<00:03:20.480> for<00:03:20.690> the<00:03:20.750> races

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
to prepare the care for the races

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.970 
to prepare the care for the races
because<00:03:21.310> we<00:03:22.310> have<00:03:22.459> us<00:03:22.730> a<00:03:22.760> good<00:03:23.030> feedback<00:03:23.269> and

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
because we have us a good feedback and

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.880 
because we have us a good feedback and
every<00:03:24.980> time<00:03:25.480> we<00:03:26.480> are<00:03:26.510> different<00:03:27.350> like<00:03:27.560> that

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
every time we are different like that

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.250 
every time we are different like that
the<00:03:27.980> car<00:03:28.160> is<00:03:28.489> going<00:03:28.579> quick<00:03:28.970> so<00:03:29.209> that's<00:03:30.019> a<00:03:30.110> good

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
the car is going quick so that's a good

fashion<00:04:07.599> savvy<00:04:08.010> but<00:04:09.010> definitely<00:04:09.670> the<00:04:10.390> most

00:04:10.559 --> 00:04:10.569 
fashion savvy but definitely the most

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.120 
fashion savvy but definitely the most
out<00:04:10.720> there<00:04:10.930> would<00:04:11.019> be<00:04:11.049> smudged<00:04:11.380> with<00:04:11.799> his<00:04:11.950> hair

don't<00:04:16.359> really<00:04:16.540> think<00:04:16.660> I'm<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:16.959> most

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:17.260 
don't really think I'm the most

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:18.990 
don't really think I'm the most
fashionable<00:04:17.650> guy<00:04:17.889> in<00:04:18.010> the<00:04:18.100> world<00:04:18.160> you<00:04:18.489> it

fashionable guy in the world you it
pretty<00:04:19.180> simple<00:04:19.709> but<00:04:21.300> that's<00:04:22.300> I<00:04:22.540> probably

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
pretty simple but that's I probably

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.900

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
the highlight of your season so far I

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:42.910 
the highlight of your season so far I
would<00:05:39.980> say<00:05:40.130> definitely<00:05:40.700> be<00:05:41.180> the<00:05:41.240> best<00:05:41.920> having

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:42.920 
would say definitely be the best having

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:45.550 
would say definitely be the best having
a<00:05:43.100> weekend<00:05:43.460> with<00:05:43.610> two<00:05:43.790> wins<00:05:44.030> it's<00:05:44.270> pretty<00:05:45.230> good

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
a weekend with two wins it's pretty good

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.640 
a weekend with two wins it's pretty good
fifty<00:05:45.920> points<00:05:46.510> I<00:05:47.510> came<00:05:47.780> back<00:05:47.930> as<00:05:48.080> well<00:05:48.260> in<00:05:48.350> the

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
fifty points I came back as well in the

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.220 
fifty points I came back as well in the
championship<00:05:49.130> so<00:05:49.400> that<00:05:50.300> was<00:05:50.450> definitely<00:05:51.200> the

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
championship so that was definitely the

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:55.030 
championship so that was definitely the
highlight<00:05:51.500> of<00:05:51.680> my<00:05:51.890> season<00:05:52.510> you<00:05:53.860> say<00:05:54.860> mine

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.010 
highlight of my season you say mine

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
would probably never be where it could

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:58.740 
would probably never be where it could
have<00:05:57.110> been<00:05:57.260> could<00:05:57.680> have<00:05:57.770> been<00:05:57.890> 50<00:05:58.130> points<00:05:58.430> but

00:05:58.740 --> 00:05:58.750 
have been could have been 50 points but

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:01.030 
have been could have been 50 points but

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:02.770 
I'm ended up getting second and race too
but<00:06:01.310> it<00:06:01.370> was<00:06:01.460> still<00:06:01.610> strong<00:06:01.910> strong<00:06:02.360> race<00:06:02.570> and

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:02.780 
but it was still strong strong race and

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.930 
but it was still strong strong race and
I<00:06:02.810> extended<00:06:03.230> my<00:06:03.380> point's<00:06:03.740> lead<00:06:03.800> and<00:06:04.070> because<00:06:04.820> I

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
I extended my point's lead and because I

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.280

led<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.210> championship<00:06:05.360> I<00:06:05.810> was<00:06:05.900> able<00:06:06.140> to<00:06:06.170> get
