make from the different things that I'm

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.910 
make from the different things that I'm
teaching<00:01:39.509> you<00:01:40.200> just<00:01:40.380> need<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.619> start

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
teaching you just need to start

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.200 
teaching you just need to start
somewhere<00:01:41.189> though<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.610> need<00:01:41.790> to<00:01:41.909> get<00:01:42.060> your

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
somewhere though you need to get your

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.880 
somewhere though you need to get your
first<00:01:42.479> deal<00:01:42.720> done<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.049> need<00:01:43.170> to<00:01:43.649> get<00:01:43.799> over

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
first deal done you need to get over

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
first deal done you need to get over
that<00:01:44.100> hump<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.640> that's<00:01:44.939> what<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.299> mentor

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
that hump and that's what the mentor

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.060 
that hump and that's what the mentor
program<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:45.990> about<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.470> get<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.770> over<00:01:46.890> the

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
program is about to get you over the

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.710 
program is about to get you over the
hump<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.399> help<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.579> understand<00:01:47.909> yeah<00:01:48.420> I<00:01:48.450> can

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
do this for some of you that are more

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.130 
do this for some of you that are more
advanced<00:01:51.210> that<00:01:51.450> are<00:01:51.570> thinking<00:01:51.810> about<00:01:51.899> the

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
advanced that are thinking about the

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.920 
advanced that are thinking about the
program<00:01:52.790> what<00:01:53.790> we<00:01:53.880> can<00:01:54.060> do<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
program what we can do for you is of

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.120 
program what we can do for you is of
probably<00:01:55.320> I'm<00:01:55.409> working<00:01:55.680> on<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.799> much<00:01:56.100> higher

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
probably I'm working on a much higher

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.170 
probably I'm working on a much higher
level<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.909> more<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.270> know<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:58.200> the<00:01:58.469> much

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
level the more you know the the much

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.500 
level the more you know the the much
the<00:02:00.860> more<00:02:01.860> valuable<00:02:02.370> this<00:02:02.520> program<00:02:03.210> will<00:02:03.390> be

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
the more valuable this program will be

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.420 
the more valuable this program will be
to<00:02:03.660> you<00:02:03.780> because<00:02:04.140> there<00:02:04.590> are<00:02:04.680> tweaks<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.220> here

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
to you because there are tweaks in here

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.310 
to you because there are tweaks in here
just<00:02:05.820> one<00:02:06.030> small<00:02:06.300> tree<00:02:06.570> could<00:02:06.750> make<00:02:06.900> a<00:02:06.930> huge

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
just one small tree could make a huge

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.749 
just one small tree could make a huge
difference<00:02:07.740> to<00:02:08.100> your<00:02:08.190> business<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.610> could

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
a very short period of time and we could

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.660 
a very short period of time and we could
