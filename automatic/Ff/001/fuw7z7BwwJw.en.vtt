you don't waste a ton of glue glue in
one<00:00:29.519> spot<00:00:30.210> and<00:00:31.040> you<00:00:32.040> waste<00:00:32.700> a<00:00:32.880> ton<00:00:33.120> of<00:00:33.149> glue<00:00:33.420> on

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
that you actually know what spots you've

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:36.889 
that you actually know what spots you've
already<00:00:35.520> glued<00:00:35.850> down<00:00:36.000> and<00:00:36.329> do<00:00:36.510> you<00:00:36.600> know<00:00:36.719> when

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
already glued down and do you know when

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
then you're going to have to go on to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.319 
then you're going to have to go on to
Google<00:00:41.640> Images<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.300> type<00:00:43.260> in<00:00:43.730> iPhone<00:00:44.730> 4<00:00:45.030> front

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
and back and the first two lines will

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.660 
and back and the first two lines will
probably<00:00:47.370> be<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.820> playing<00:00:48.059> iPhone<00:00:49.050> 4<00:00:49.739> images

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670

mess<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.680> up<00:01:55.799> because<00:01:56.520> if<00:01:56.790> you<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.090> that's

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
mess it up because if you do that's

gonna<00:01:57.479> be<00:01:57.659> messed<00:01:57.869> up<00:01:58.490> okay<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.790> try<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.149> round

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
gonna be messed up okay and try to round

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.380 
gonna be messed up okay and try to round
the<00:02:00.600> edges<00:02:00.649> so<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:02.250> not<00:02:02.729> just<00:02:03.060> straight

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
the edges so it's not just straight

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.399 
the edges so it's not just straight
because<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.689> don't<00:02:03.869> want<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> straight

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
because you don't want to straight

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.069 
because you don't want to straight

everyone okay I've just cut out the
front<00:02:07.200> in<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.530> back<00:02:07.710> of<00:02:07.979> an<00:02:08.280> iPhone<00:02:08.670> and

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
front in the back of an iPhone and

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.089 
front in the back of an iPhone and
they're<00:02:09.179> kind<00:02:09.420> of<00:02:09.539> like<00:02:09.810> uneven<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.340> I'm<00:02:11.700> so

00:02:13.089 --> 00:02:13.099 
they're kind of like uneven so I'm so

they're kind of like uneven so I'm so
I<00:02:13.129> will<00:02:13.819> just<00:02:14.030> trim<00:02:14.299> it<00:02:14.329> after<00:02:15.019> I<00:02:15.049> finished<00:02:15.469> the

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
I will just trim it after I finished the

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.949 
I will just trim it after I finished the
project<00:02:15.739> this<00:02:16.700> part<00:02:16.999> you<00:02:17.180> can<00:02:17.209> actually<00:02:17.749> use

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
project this part you can actually use

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.780 
project this part you can actually use
an<00:02:18.200> index<00:02:18.650> card<00:02:18.859> if<00:02:18.980> you<00:02:19.069> want<00:02:19.249> I<00:02:19.370> don't<00:02:19.459> have

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
an index card if you want I don't have

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.890 
an index card if you want I don't have
one<00:02:20.060> but<00:02:20.719> you<00:02:20.780> can<00:02:21.519> trace<00:02:22.519> one<00:02:23.180> side<00:02:23.510> of<00:02:23.629> it<00:02:23.780> and

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
one but you can trace one side of it and

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.199 
one but you can trace one side of it and
just<00:02:24.650> cut<00:02:24.829> it<00:02:24.859> out<00:02:25.010> you<00:02:25.400> don't<00:02:25.489> really<00:02:25.700> need<00:02:25.969> it

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
just cut it out you don't really need it

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:27.970 
just cut it out you don't really need it
but<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.810> know<00:02:27.079> I<00:02:27.109> guess<00:02:27.499> it<00:02:27.620> came<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:27.889> the

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
but you know I guess it came to the

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.280 
but you know I guess it came to the
extra<00:02:28.340> support<00:02:28.700> so<00:02:28.909> now<00:02:29.689> what<00:02:29.840> you're<00:02:30.019> going

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
extra support so now what you're going

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.069 
extra support so now what you're going
to<00:02:30.349> do<00:02:30.560> is<00:02:30.859> you<00:02:31.849> are<00:02:31.879> going<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.420> take<00:02:32.599> this<00:02:32.780> and

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:33.079 
to do is you are going to take this and

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:35.890 
to do is you are going to take this and
when<00:02:33.230> I'm<00:02:33.349> you<00:02:33.530> may<00:02:33.709> remember<00:02:34.340> what<00:02:34.730> side<00:02:35.150> you

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
when I'm you may remember what side you

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.330 
when I'm you may remember what side you
put<00:02:36.079> it<00:02:36.170> down<00:02:36.319> like<00:02:36.349> you<00:02:36.709> put<00:02:37.129> it<00:02:37.189> down<00:02:37.310> like

going<00:02:41.180> to<00:02:41.299> cover<00:02:41.419> with<00:02:41.659> glue<00:02:42.400> like<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.079> think

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
going to cover with glue like so think

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:52.849 
okay okay so I just adjusted the camera

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.860 
okay okay so I just adjusted the camera
so<00:02:52.969> you<00:02:53.000> can<00:02:53.090> see<00:02:53.359> it<00:02:53.480> and<00:02:53.810> I<00:02:54.579> covered<00:02:55.870> this

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
so you can see it and I covered this

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.550 
so you can see it and I covered this
part<00:02:57.530> of<00:02:58.010> it<00:02:58.250> in<00:02:59.000> glue<00:02:59.269> and<00:02:59.299> just<00:02:59.810> like<00:02:59.989> squeeze

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
part of it in glue and just like squeeze

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.339 
part of it in glue and just like squeeze
the<00:03:00.680> other<00:03:00.829> one<00:03:01.040> on<00:03:01.159> but<00:03:01.609> make<00:03:01.879> sure<00:03:01.909> it's<00:03:02.900> like

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
the other one on but make sure it's like

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.069 
the other one on but make sure it's like
exact<00:03:04.310> you'd<00:03:04.760> you<00:03:05.299> don't<00:03:05.540> want<00:03:05.689> to<00:03:05.780> have<00:03:05.900> it

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
exact you'd you don't want to have it

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:06.759 
exact you'd you don't want to have it
backwards

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
backwards

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.619 
backwards
so<00:03:07.340> you've<00:03:07.609> leave<00:03:07.819> them<00:03:07.969> together<00:03:08.120> and<00:03:08.510> you

00:03:08.619 --> 00:03:08.629 
so you've leave them together and you

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.569 
so you've leave them together and you
could<00:03:08.780> have<00:03:08.900> glued<00:03:09.139> the<00:03:09.230> ends<00:03:09.530> in<00:03:10.010> next<00:03:10.370> card

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
could have glued the ends in next card

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.069 
could have glued the ends in next card
to<00:03:10.609> one<00:03:10.790> of<00:03:10.909> them<00:03:11.030> and<00:03:11.150> then<00:03:11.689> glue<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.049> other

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
to one of them and then glue the other

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:14.470 
to one of them and then glue the other
one<00:03:12.379> on<00:03:12.530> so<00:03:13.010> it's<00:03:13.219> like<00:03:13.400> thicker<00:03:13.790> and<00:03:14.150> more

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
one on so it's like thicker and more

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.499 
one on so it's like thicker and more
sturdy<00:03:15.139> but<00:03:15.439> you<00:03:15.530> don't<00:03:15.680> have<00:03:15.889> to<00:03:16.159> and<00:03:16.790> you

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:17.509 
sturdy but you don't have to and you

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:19.119 
sturdy but you don't have to and you
could<00:03:17.689> have<00:03:17.780> also<00:03:17.930> done<00:03:18.079> that<00:03:18.259> with<00:03:18.650> tape<00:03:18.859> and

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
could have also done that with tape and

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.499 
could have also done that with tape and
like<00:03:19.280> maybe<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.549> little<00:03:19.729> circle<00:03:20.060> tape<00:03:20.239> and<00:03:20.389> just

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:20.509 
like maybe a little circle tape and just

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:23.289 
like maybe a little circle tape and just
stuck<00:03:20.659> it<00:03:20.780> on<00:03:20.870> and<00:03:21.259> now<00:03:21.799> if<00:03:22.129> you<00:03:22.250> want<00:03:22.489> to<00:03:22.699> I<00:03:22.939> ran

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
stuck it on and now if you want to I ran

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:25.479 
stuck it on and now if you want to I ran
on<00:03:23.419> tape<00:03:23.629> so<00:03:23.780> I<00:03:23.810> can't<00:03:24.079> but<00:03:24.500> you<00:03:24.919> can<00:03:25.099> just<00:03:25.280> tape

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:25.489 
on tape so I can't but you can just tape

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:28.149 
on tape so I can't but you can just tape
the<00:03:25.669> edges<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:26.269> seal<00:03:26.479> them<00:03:26.750> together<00:03:26.900> so<00:03:27.709> you

00:03:28.149 --> 00:03:28.159 
the edges to seal them together so you

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:30.369 
the edges to seal them together so you
have<00:03:28.669> a<00:03:28.699> sturdier<00:03:29.389> thing<00:03:29.659> and<00:03:29.930> now<00:03:30.049> mine's

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:30.379 
have a sturdier thing and now mine's

00:03:30.379 --> 00:03:32.499 
have a sturdier thing and now mine's
kind<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.680> flimsy<00:03:30.859> so<00:03:31.549> I<00:03:31.579> just<00:03:31.909> need<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.180> have<00:03:32.359> it

00:03:32.499 --> 00:03:32.509 
kind of flimsy so I just need to have it

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:34.689 
kind of flimsy so I just need to have it
