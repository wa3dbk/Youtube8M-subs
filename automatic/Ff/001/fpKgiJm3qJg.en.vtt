00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.250 
might say that's like a waste of money
really<00:00:20.340> but<00:00:20.550> really<00:00:20.760> I<00:00:21.359> did<00:00:21.720> want<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.109> egg

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
really but really I did want the egg

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.320 
really but really I did want the egg
pond<00:00:22.500> because<00:00:22.740> he<00:00:23.160> looks<00:00:23.400> fantastic<00:00:23.640> it's

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
pond because he looks fantastic it's

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.700 
pond because he looks fantastic it's
like<00:00:24.480> having<00:00:24.750> another<00:00:24.810> 3-inch<00:00:25.410> scale<00:00:26.039> figure

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:27.710 
like having another 3-inch scale figure

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.800 
like having another 3-inch scale figure
so<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.039> very<00:00:29.250> cool<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> pick<00:00:29.670> that<00:00:29.820> up

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
so it is very cool to pick that up

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.100 
so it is very cool to pick that up
second<00:00:32.180> this<00:00:33.180> was<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.660> rather<00:00:33.899> surprising<00:00:34.290> find

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
second this was a rather surprising find

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.549 
second this was a rather surprising find
both<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.350> object<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.219> where<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:38.820> got<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.559> of

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
both the object and where I got it of

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.500 
both the object and where I got it of
all<00:00:40.739> places<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.219> got<00:00:41.340> them<00:00:41.520> at<00:00:41.640> Target<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:42.210> they

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
all places I got them at Target and they

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.560 
all places I got them at Target and they
are<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.899> sonic<00:00:43.500> gotcha<00:00:44.180> buildable<00:00:45.180> figures

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
are the sonic gotcha buildable figures

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.979 
are the sonic gotcha buildable figures
that's<00:00:46.320> right<00:00:46.590> I<00:00:46.829> got<00:00:47.700> three<00:00:48.030> of<00:00:48.059> them<00:00:48.270> now<00:00:48.960> I

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
that's right I got three of them now I

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.900 
that's right I got three of them now I
if<00:00:49.530> I'm<00:00:49.890> correct

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
if I'm correct

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.660 
if I'm correct
they<00:00:51.719> have<00:00:51.989> there<00:00:52.710> are<00:00:52.770> two<00:00:53.010> figures<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.550> each

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
they have there are two figures in each

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.360 
they have there are two figures in each
ball<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.570> adds<00:00:54.809> up<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.050> six<00:00:55.410> figures<00:00:55.590> if

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
ball so that adds up to six figures if

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.889 
ball so that adds up to six figures if
