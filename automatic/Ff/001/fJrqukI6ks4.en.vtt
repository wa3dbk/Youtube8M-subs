pitted you can do cherries two ways you

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:09.420 
pitted you can do cherries two ways you
can<00:03:05.829> do<00:03:06.099> them<00:03:06.540> with<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:08.200> pits<00:03:08.470> in<00:03:08.799> just<00:03:09.189> make

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.430

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.210 

and<00:03:20.870> now<00:03:21.140> we're<00:03:21.470> going<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.650> cover<00:03:21.950> our

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
and now we're going to cover our

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.300 
and now we're going to cover our
cherries<00:03:22.819> with<00:03:23.150> some<00:03:23.420> more<00:03:23.569> syrup<00:03:24.310> leaving

cherries with some more syrup leaving

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.430 
cherries with some more syrup leaving
about<00:03:25.519> a<00:03:25.580> half<00:03:25.910> inch<00:03:26.120> head<00:03:26.480> space<00:03:26.810> is<00:03:27.140> what<00:03:27.319> the

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
about a half inch head space is what the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:41.290 
about a half inch head space is what the
recipe<00:03:27.650> calls<00:03:28.069> for<00:03:29.200> cherries

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.970

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
if you're working with these and one

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.059 
if you're working with these and one
doesn't<00:03:44.250> quite<00:03:44.640> fit<00:03:45.030> you<00:03:45.360> can<00:03:45.540> just<00:03:45.890> take<00:03:46.890> it

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
doesn't quite fit you can just take it

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:52.400 
doesn't quite fit you can just take it
out<00:03:47.190> there<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:49.560> my<00:03:49.709> wet<00:03:50.330> wash<00:03:51.330> cloth<00:03:51.360> to<00:03:52.200> clean

room temperature countertop and we're

00:06:34.170 --> 00:06:36.260 
room temperature countertop and we're
also<00:06:34.260> going<00:06:34.590> to<00:06:34.710> drape<00:06:35.070> another<00:06:35.460> towel<00:06:35.820> over

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:36.270 
also going to drape another towel over

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.890 
also going to drape another towel over
top<00:06:36.570> of<00:06:36.600> them<00:06:36.900> this<00:06:37.650> will<00:06:37.860> prevent<00:06:38.250> any<00:06:38.900> cool

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
top of them this will prevent any cool

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.500 
top of them this will prevent any cool
air<00:06:40.230> from<00:06:40.560> a<00:06:40.710> fan<00:06:41.010> or<00:06:41.040> an<00:06:41.490> open<00:06:41.760> window<00:06:41.940> or<00:06:42.330> any

other<00:06:42.720> drafts<00:06:43.110> that<00:06:43.320> might<00:06:43.590> happen<00:06:43.860> because

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
other drafts that might happen because

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.610 
other drafts that might happen because
we<00:06:44.700> don't<00:06:44.880> want<00:06:45.060> the<00:06:45.150> jars<00:06:45.390> to<00:06:45.720> cool<00:06:46.080> down<00:06:46.110> too

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620 
we don't want the jars to cool down too

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.880 
we don't want the jars to cool down too
quickly<00:06:46.650> or<00:06:47.370> they<00:06:47.790> might<00:06:48.180> break<00:06:48.510> so<00:06:49.380> this<00:06:49.680> is<00:06:49.860> a

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:49.890 
quickly or they might break so this is a

00:06:49.890 --> 00:06:53.120 
quickly or they might break so this is a
great<00:06:50.100> way<00:06:50.400> to<00:06:50.460> avoid<00:06:50.970> that<00:06:51.500> so<00:06:52.500> if<00:06:52.860> you<00:06:53.010> have

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:53.130 
great way to avoid that so if you have

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:55.310 
great way to avoid that so if you have
any<00:06:53.340> more<00:06:53.490> questions<00:06:53.700> about<00:06:54.300> canning<00:06:55.170> or

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
any more questions about canning or
