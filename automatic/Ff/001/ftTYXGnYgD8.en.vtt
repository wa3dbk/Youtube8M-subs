00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:15.110
 good afternoon today we will look at two 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.949
 clinical examples of patients with the syndrome 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.440
 acoustics gnostic phase 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:23.120
 acoustics of gnostic aphasia due to 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.090
 local cerebral disorder 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:30.880
 blood circulation in the middle temporal 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.440
 parts of the left hemisphere wernicke zone 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.329
 clinical manifestations of this syndrome 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.629
 expressed in speech auditory agnosia 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:43.390
 comprehension errors in speech perception 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:46.969
 verbal or tyral prophase them 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:49.870
 verbal message of his tasty ella harry and 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.629
 due to impaired hearing 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.170
 consider the first clinical example 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.670
 sick to 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.909
 u bal n ka with a clinical picture 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.769
 acoustics of gnostic aphasia was observed 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:05.930
 oppression functioning higher 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:09.130
 specified area of ​​the cerebral cortex 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.250
 according to computed tomography 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.350
 picture 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:25.570
 volume education in the left temporal 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:25.570
 lobe open mouth raise hand up 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:37.380
 arm up arm up this way 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:40.329
 the patient to noted the following difficulties 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.219
 gross violation of understanding 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:46.090
 speeches 

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:49.569
 alienation understanding the meaning of the word however 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:52.420
 abundant unproductive speech missing 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:55.600
 perhaps this is due to the stand 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.659
 irreversibility of speech impairment as 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.709
 at the time of inspection speech violation 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.049
 proceeded in this patient 

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:06.670
 about three years we consider a plan 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.250
 rehabilitating the patient to 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:12.819
 in this case it is necessary to work 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.190
 following directions to recover 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:18.000
 understanding of the simplest speech instructions 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.690
 and understanding of situational speech 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.780
 recovering subject relatedness 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.629
 words to work on perception 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.190
 global reading 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.700
 activating thereby subdominant 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:35.410
 hemispheres and restore opportunity 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:37.840
 understanding of semantic distortions let's go 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:39.989
 to the second clinical example the patient 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.989
 t 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.730
 if yesterday was tuesday then today 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:52.530
 the day of the week that the market yesterday on tuesday a 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.530
 today is the most 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:03:02.260
 43 defenses 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:02.260
 3 not that we hear something we repeat 

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.519
 ba-ba-ba-ba 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:22.290
 yes that yes I do not know how this patient 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.830
 observed moderate severity 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:29.400
 speech disorders her characteristic errors 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:33.040
 comprehension in speech perception also 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:36.180
 marks the search for words from a series of washing away 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.920
 alternatives for their acoustic proximity 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.760
 characterized by pronounced difficulty with 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.430
 perception 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.730
 acoustically close phonemes that is 

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.579
 violation of phonemic perception 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.560
 in this case, with a moderate degree 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:52.269
 manifestations of the syndrome 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.840
 rehabilitation is as follows 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.370
 plan needs to be restored 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.920
 phonemic perception with 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.620
 word differentiation with opposition 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.500
 phonemes 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:07.049
 restore analytical reading 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.290
 carry out restoration work 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:12.750
 word semantics with 

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:15.539
 transform some words from others 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:18.280
 matching word definitions 

00:04:15.539 --> 00:04:22.320
 differentiation words about phonographs mafona 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.320
 homonyms of synonyms and antonyms 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:28.060
 today we reviewed two clinical 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.350
 an example of the Gnostic acoustics syndrome 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.820
 about asia and determined their direction 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.720
 rehabilitation 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.720
 thank you for attention
