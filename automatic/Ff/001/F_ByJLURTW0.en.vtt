a double hackle fly now I think that

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.220 
a double hackle fly now I think that
this<00:03:37.260> is<00:03:37.530> is<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:38.310> remember<00:03:39.150> if<00:03:39.570> I<00:03:39.750> called<00:03:40.110> a

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
this is is I remember if I called a

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.460 
this is is I remember if I called a
Bearpaw<00:03:40.850> it<00:03:41.850> had<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.120> red<00:03:42.420> tail<00:03:42.690> yellow<00:03:43.200> body

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
Bearpaw it had a red tail yellow body

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.660 
Bearpaw it had a red tail yellow body
and<00:03:43.769> grizzly<00:03:44.489> four<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.209> four<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:45.989> half

and grizzly four and four and a half

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.940 
and grizzly four and four and a half
I've<00:03:47.670> adapted<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.630> style<00:03:49.170> using<00:03:49.769> two

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
I've adapted that style using two

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.970 
I've adapted that style using two
hackles<00:03:50.459> with<00:03:51.239> the<00:03:51.360> button<00:03:51.780> and<00:03:51.989> sometimes

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
hackles with the button and sometimes

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.000 
hackles with the button and sometimes
the<00:03:53.160> same<00:03:53.400> hackle<00:03:53.870> fore-and-aft<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.320> then<00:03:55.860> of

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
the same hackle fore-and-aft and then of

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.500 
the same hackle fore-and-aft and then of
a<00:03:56.040> fuzzy<00:03:56.610> dubbed<00:03:57.360> body<00:03:57.890> these<00:03:58.890> are<00:03:59.510> really

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
a fuzzy dubbed body these are really

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.210 
a fuzzy dubbed body these are really
great<00:04:01.079> flies<00:04:02.600> so<00:04:03.600> this<00:04:03.900> old<00:04:04.170> final<00:04:04.769> final

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
great flies so this old final final

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.060 
great flies so this old final final
final<00:04:05.549> final<00:04:05.880> here<00:04:06.600> we<00:04:06.720> go<00:04:06.900> let's<00:04:07.350> let's<00:04:07.739> take

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
final final here we go let's let's take

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:13.039 
final final here we go let's let's take
a<00:04:10.340> now<00:04:11.340> let<00:04:11.519> me<00:04:11.610> show<00:04:11.910> you<00:04:11.970> the<00:04:12.420> difference

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
a now let me show you the difference

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:20.220 
a now let me show you the difference
I'll<00:04:13.739> pull<00:04:14.430> a<00:04:14.459> few<00:04:14.790> of<00:04:14.940> these<00:04:15.060> out<00:04:15.480> here

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:20.230 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.530 

so<00:04:21.230> this<00:04:21.740> Phi<00:04:22.010> has<00:04:22.430> a<00:04:22.730> white<00:04:23.120> deer<00:04:24.110> body<00:04:24.530> Wayne

then<00:04:34.100> a<00:04:34.340> collar<00:04:34.730> hackle<00:04:35.590> could<00:04:36.590> be<00:04:36.740> shall

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
then a collar hackle could be shall

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.790 
then a collar hackle could be shall
happen<00:04:37.310> could<00:04:37.520> be<00:04:37.550> rooster<00:04:38.150> webby<00:04:38.800> American

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:39.800 
happen could be rooster webby American

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:42.670 
happen could be rooster webby American
saddle<00:04:40.220> club<00:04:40.400> keys<00:04:40.970> its<00:04:41.420> webby<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.170> it's<00:04:42.320> long

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
saddle club keys its webby and it's long

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.190 
saddle club keys its webby and it's long
enough<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.820> will<00:04:43.940> flow<00:04:44.240> in<00:04:44.450> the<00:04:44.570> water<00:04:44.780> the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:45.200 
enough it will flow in the water the

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.270 
enough it will flow in the water the
deer<00:04:45.440> hair<00:04:45.710> will<00:04:45.920> flow<00:04:46.630> as<00:04:47.630> you<00:04:48.350> go<00:04:48.560> from<00:04:48.830> here

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
deer hair will flow as you go from here

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.610 
deer hair will flow as you go from here
to<00:04:49.550> here<00:04:49.940> to<00:04:49.970> here<00:04:50.420> you<00:04:50.450> have<00:04:50.810> slightly<00:04:51.170> bigger

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
to here to here you have slightly bigger

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.950 
to here to here you have slightly bigger
profiles<00:04:52.390> so<00:04:53.390> if<00:04:53.840> you<00:04:54.440> have<00:04:54.740> a<00:04:54.770> day<00:04:55.130> one<00:04:55.370> fish

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
profiles so if you have a day one fish

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.210 
profiles so if you have a day one fish
they<00:04:56.960> won't<00:04:57.230> pay<00:04:57.410> attention<00:04:57.890> to<00:04:57.950> this

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
they won't pay attention to this

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
they won't pay attention to this
sometimes<00:04:58.970> I'll<00:04:59.240> clobber<00:04:59.600> this<00:04:59.930> other<00:05:00.800> days

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
sometimes I'll clobber this other days

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:03.910 
sometimes I'll clobber this other days
they<00:05:02.240> will<00:05:02.450> come<00:05:02.750> close<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.110> clobbering<00:05:03.890> the

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:03.920 
they will come close to clobbering the

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:06.670 
they will come close to clobbering the
