00:00:07.698 --> 00:00:13.667
 This group of clothing is completely different from the past, very brave and very fashionable. 

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:16.245
 There is more space for younger generations 

00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:17.825
 Because it fits the modern era 

00:00:17.825 --> 00:00:20.410
 Focus on younger generations 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.395
 Seen JW Anderson Alexander McQueen 

00:00:24.395 --> 00:00:25.880
 After Alexander Wang 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.748
 I feel a bit old-schooled. 

00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:32.168
 I think this is the most amazing fashion show of the season. 

00:00:32.168 --> 00:00:34.767
 Really escape the style of Frida in the past 

00:00:34.767 --> 00:00:38.240
 This is definitely not the Gucci tradition in our minds. 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:39.867
 But the designer is interesting 

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:43.276
 Is to adopt the concept of such a household output 

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:44.967
 This is a big brand 

00:00:44.967 --> 00:00:48.567
 So I always feel that if it is a younger brand, it seems to be more natural. 

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:51.066
 This is a company with many specialty stores around the world. 

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:55.975
 How can this unique message be conveyed to the retail pipeline? 

00:00:55.975 --> 00:00:57.700
 I think it will be the challenge he has to face. 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.934
 Feeling very young and full of inspiration 

00:01:00.934 --> 00:01:03.800
 I think it feels very fresh for a brand like Gucci. 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.333
 But still can see some classic styles 

00:01:08.333 --> 00:01:11.000
 So you feel the classic elements of Gucci 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.353
 But the spirit of this girl is definitely younger and more modern. 

00:01:14.353 --> 00:01:17.455
 I like the vague feeling inside. Is she a boy or a girl? 

00:01:17.455 --> 00:01:19.090
 Whose clothes she wears? 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:21.225
 I think this is really a good new start. 

00:01:22.725 --> 00:01:24.661
 It all looks completely different 

00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:26.367
 Good decadence 

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:28.734
 Celebrating fragile youth 

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:31.066
 a little nostalgic or sad 

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:34.001
 Because this is a time when you can't repeat it. 

00:01:34.001 --> 00:01:38.300
 They always look back and find a little bit 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.500
 Thinking back romantically 

00:01:40.934 --> 00:01:42.575
 The current era is bitter 

00:01:42.575 --> 00:01:46.333
 If you watch the news watching TV 

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.665
 You will be afraid of the younger generation 

00:01:48.665 --> 00:01:51.233
 The new generation needs love 

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:52.648
 romantic 

00:01:52.648 --> 00:01:55.967
 Maybe this is why they are so nostalgic 

00:01:55.967 --> 00:01:57.000
 Because it is very bitter 

00:01:57.867 --> 00:02:00.540
 I don't think there is any optimism in it. 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.600
 May be to return to fashion emotions 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.667
 You know 

00:02:04.667 --> 00:02:08.400
 Maybe we should have feelings when we see these costumes. 

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.380
 Instead of simply thinking about its surface
