00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.910
 Today I'm going to prepare some steaks 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.250
 chicken with lemon sauce 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.610
 ingredients that we need are about 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.590
 chicken fillets a spoonful of sugar 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.689
 half a spoonful of half oregano 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.970
 spoonful of rosemary the juice of a lemon 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.970
 salt pepper and olive oil 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.760
 you are going to see that it is a recipe 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:35.860
 simple but let's get the 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.960
 chicken we are apart from my tender very 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.510
 tasty the first thing we're going to do is 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:44.700
 prepare a marinade we put the juice of 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.280
 lemon in a bowl and we're going to throw 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.539
 a little bit of olive oil 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.539
 like a spoonful 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.970
 a rosemary 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.960
 and the oregano 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:02.190
 we are going to talk to you 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.190
 and finally 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.200
 and this we are going to add on top of 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.650
 the chicken breasts all the files of 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.650
 breast 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.780
 Yeah all right 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.880
 let's see it so that always good 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.880
 all the steaks on all sides 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.140
 and we're going to leave it macerating at least 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.140
 half an hour 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.010
 The next thing we're going to do is put 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.560
 a pan to the fire with a spoonful of 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.689
 olive oil 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.689
 and let's laugh the steaks 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:46.800
 in giving them a little bit and with national care 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.240
 or because it is necessary 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.240
 we start with salt 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:59.290
 at home you know it depends on how you 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.290
 like you 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.700
 and we are going to let it be that they are 

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.700
 golden 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.970
 when we will not be ready we 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.760
 we remove the pan 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.069
 and we booked it and now in this same 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:21.430
 skillet what we are going to do deglaze 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.889
 for this we take all the juice where 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.270
 we had the steaks stored and 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:28.420
 we only add 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.590
 here too 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.590
 the spoonful of sugar 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.390
 We are not going to move and you are going to see how 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.790
 when lemon juice is going to take off 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.370
 everything that has remained stuck in the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.440
 pan and you're going to make a great sauce 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.710
 we 're going to cook it for a couple of 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.710
 minutes 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.880
 Now all we have to do is 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.630
 sautÃ© the steaks 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.630
 a little bit 

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:04.099
 and wants to put is the accompaniment that 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.989
 more you like me this time I've done 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:08.299
 a few strips of fried colored peppers 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:10.250
 to accompany so you prove it 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.459
 because I'm sure you're going to like it 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.459
 soon
