00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.619
 guys i 'm always power 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.679
 I'm sorry if I have these days 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.570
 only published gameplay without 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:24.570
 maybe an explanation of some perk 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:28.019
 tactics I'm not even doing power 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.939
 personal trainers but unfortunately they are 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:35.250
 for about three days sick with fevers 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:37.170
 very high to be thirty years old from 39 to 40 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.150
 of fever I can't even stay in 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.020
 feet almost in fact now I'm lying in 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:44.340
 talk anyway I want to talk to you 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.900
 however of those that are the projects 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.480
 now that i took the one because how 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.770
 you know today that it's November 22nd that is 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.610
 among other things of my day 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:57.300
 birthday that the exit of the former box one 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.300
 today I took the one I took the one with 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.400
 ghost and I promise that in the coming days 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.650
 I will publish gameplay and explanations if 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.780
 maybe I'll find striking differences and 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.060
 maybe things you can do on 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.950
 wan that cannot be done on the 360 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.030
 I always want you about beauty 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.470
 also talk a little about those who 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.820
 will be future projects now that it is 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.300
 output this new console 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.550
 first the hour will be released soon 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.040
 war mode between clans and how you have 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.900
 seen since today it has been implemented 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.100
 mlg settings in private games and the 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.380
 re broadcaster mod 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.120
 what broadcaster fashions are like 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.630
 the cinema that is the cinema podcast of 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:39.720
 of black ops two settings are gods 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.920
 settings that you can activate and play 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.840
 therefore immediately in private game without 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.550
 having to respect etcetera that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.360
 will always be updated by the i 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:51.000
 vision through the mlc anyway besides 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.830
 this will begin the bauer personal series 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.229
 trainer I found many new tips 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:57.360
 that you can use many new tactics 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.880
 many new things to do in order to 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.180
 improve your aim at yours 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.710
 skill your multitasking so on 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.000
 in addition to this they start new series 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.099
 concerning the callouts 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.019
 they will be very precise they will be callouts 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:13.709
 that are used both by us players 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.420
 Italians will try to Italianize there but 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.670
 will be mainly 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.660
 fast kahlout so for example top 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.510
 med bot 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.690
 who wants to say bot under mid top center 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.880
 evening for example will always be used therefore 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.290
 you can't do anything about it 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.690
 English you have to use them for strength are 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.569
 much simpler and faster to use 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.459
 besides this I want to bring want 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:38.069
 talk about what will lead to one 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.630
 how do you know how to treat this game for a 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.160
 year I think it's impossible though 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.170
 put gameplay of scream after one 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.900
 place you thought it would be boring to break this 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.250
 balls almost already in these two 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.489
 weeks have been two weeks 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.110
 from the exit I discovered almost everything 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.000
 purpose of bile in this game almost 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.130
 all the secrets like the endless run 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.750
 for example I also discovered a way to 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.950
 make points faster as you do 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.410
 many too many all these things 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.910
 besides this I wanted to tell you that 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.350
 practically of the alter or also of others 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.269
 games because I want to treat others 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.670
 games because I don't play only at cod 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:14.160
 I'm both a fps fanatic 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.000
 general however I also love the games of 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.720
 role 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.220
 mmo rpg ie massive role-playing games 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.570
 online and then if I have the opportunity 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.820
 I'll try and play some of these 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.920
 those obviously will innovate you and more 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.500
 am funny for example I don't know if you 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.630
 you know dark soul but it is a game that a 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.040
 I loved it on xbox is 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.590
 succeeded first for ps3 who have it 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.420
 also done for xbox practically this 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.280
 game had been one of the most games 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.140
 difficult I played reminded me of 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.829
 a little bit when I played as a child 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.870
 to the open world role-playing games and not there 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.640
 I understood nothing here in this case 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.980
 I understood however it was really a challenge to 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.570
 beat a boss maybe after three days 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:55.920
 yesterday I was trying to do this boss there 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.109
 I was able to ask for one of mine 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.670
 friend who had it he he I 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.799
 he said look you have to do so I have it 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.780
 beaten will also happen beautiful 

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.840
 to boast of having beaten to have 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.109
 made things really difficult there 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.090
 I'm 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:10.260
 if you see on youtube are several videos 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.060
 of people playing this game 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.709
 sclera because very funny 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.540
 therefore it requires a lot of skill 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:18.930
 I will surely treat him because he will be released on 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.289
 sequel on xbox one I will also play a 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.820
 new fps surely as titan folk and 

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:26.729
 maybe one of the games that I wait for the most 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:27.440
 on this new console and I'll also try 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.100
 the new m 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.330
 mr bg such as destiny which I think 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.250
 because you have seen that it will be the new 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.710
 revolutionary game of the bongi of the 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.770
 sorry bunge that will revolutionize all 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.440
 massive online fps role-playing games 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.150
 anyway beyond this I hope to 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.970
 recover soon from this fever and ad 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:51.230
 start with important series why 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:53.690
 obviously hurry gameplay where I'll say 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:57.160
 that is but look at it makes me think 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.050
 oh well I was a bit bored then 

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.730
 I don't know, I prefer you look 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.640
 something more fun than most 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:07.970
 innovative and face them a little more 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.190
 I don't understand the game how it works 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:12.920
 things that maybe don't jump right away 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:14.480
 to the eye which advices I put 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.790
 all together maybe in a series of 

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.800
 videos can do something great and 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.570
 so excuse me for this 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:23.710
 inconvenience we get the next 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.710
 video beautiful girl
