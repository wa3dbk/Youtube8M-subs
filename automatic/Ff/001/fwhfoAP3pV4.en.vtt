00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:15.750
 and here back I tell myself that there is always 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.550
 that started badly and in front of that dress 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.900
 just like the kid gives me exactly 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.140
 same because this race is not going 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.140
 run 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.630
 total constipation 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.700
 there is an incredible spice of sting 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.780
 tic dragon is called this grace the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.870
 world player what happens that go to play 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.789
 I ate super new porsche t 20 and 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.110
 I have to try acrobatics with this 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.250
 Small weight to see if you can see how 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.930
 will disengage well and the whole subject 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:55.920
 so I'm really sorry to see if 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.200
 we got good let's leave sure 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.880
 let's back 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.880
 come on let's go fast 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:14.360
 it's perfectly normal actually 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.660
 sincerely, the point , we have not 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.130
 gone so let's go with the second 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.020
 back to see if I can get through well 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.700
 all because I'll have to give it to me 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.840
 way a little bit the truth but the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.100
 true that it gets hooked but it has the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.990
 car or I remember when I passed 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.580
 he knows with the environment in the first 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.860
 curve since you have already seen that accelerates 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.060
 enough because if you do not get hooked 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.070
 the car goes and this one without accelerating this 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.330
 also perfectly so cool is a 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.070
 car also that is pretty 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:43.350
 get hooked to play me the game me the 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.270
 I'll play the girl something better 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.830
 my kid mother figure is calculated tico 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.220
 I was absolutely absolutist 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.220
 calculating 

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:56.960
 I love that recording we look over here 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.520
 it was perfect 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.869
 and let's see if we 're going to show the 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.240
 first moment we go first without 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.630
 no problem type the writers of 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.630
 weather 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.250
 he's perfect perfect boy so what 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:20.590
 perfect step to the identical as we are 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.590
 today very acrobatic sr 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:29.120
 because we're going to win because it was two 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.830
 laps and good everything that was a little 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.780
 short and good words that I thought 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.780
 it's going to be a little faster
