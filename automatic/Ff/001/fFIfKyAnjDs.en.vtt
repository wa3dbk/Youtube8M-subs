pretty interesting story and I I don't
know<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.530> there's<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.740> clear-cut<00:01:14.070> answer<00:01:14.400> it

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
know that there's a clear-cut answer it

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.940 
know that there's a clear-cut answer it
brings<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:15.000> lot<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.530> alternative<00:01:16.530> issues

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
brings up a lot of alternative issues

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
brings up a lot of alternative issues
and<00:01:17.310> should<00:01:17.820> they<00:01:17.970> be<00:01:18.030> able<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.360> unionize

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and should they be able to unionize

and should they be able to unionize
should<00:01:19.290> our<00:01:19.409> students<00:01:20.240> should<00:01:21.240> they<00:01:21.420> be

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
should our students should they be

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.260 
should our students should they be
playing<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.560> 50<00:01:23.250> hours<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.610> sports<00:01:24.090> a

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
playing you know 50 hours of sports a

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:25.880 
playing you know 50 hours of sports a
week<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.689> think<00:01:24.840> there<00:01:25.110> is<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.229> stipulation<00:01:25.560> they

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
week I think there is a stipulation they

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.859 
week I think there is a stipulation they
actually<00:01:26.250> shouldn't<00:01:26.520> be<00:01:26.729> required<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.720> do

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
actually shouldn't be required to do

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.990 
actually shouldn't be required to do
more<00:01:27.900> than<00:01:28.170> 20<00:01:28.530> hours<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:29.400> you're<00:01:29.549> a<00:01:29.579> d1

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
more than 20 hours but you're a d1

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.149 
more than 20 hours but you're a d1
school<00:01:30.390> it<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.990> literally<00:01:31.290> tens<00:01:31.680> of<00:01:31.829> millions

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
school it is literally tens of millions

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.310 
school it is literally tens of millions
of<00:01:32.250> dollars<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.700> your<00:01:32.909> university<00:01:33.540> college

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320

of dollars to your university college
coaches<00:01:34.740> demand<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.460> best<00:01:35.700> and<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.030> hope<00:01:36.210> is

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
coaches demand the best and the hope is

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.030 
coaches demand the best and the hope is
that<00:01:36.630> some<00:01:37.170> of<00:01:37.229> them<00:01:37.350> can<00:01:37.560> make<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
that some of them can make it to the

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.219 
that some of them can make it to the
majors<00:01:38.340> yeah<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:38.939> it<00:01:39.600> becomes<00:01:39.869> an<00:01:39.990> issue<00:01:40.079> of

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
majors yeah and it becomes an issue of

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.020 
majors yeah and it becomes an issue of
are<00:01:40.500> they<00:01:40.650> being<00:01:40.890> exploited<00:01:41.430> they're

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
are they being exploited they're

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.670 
are they being exploited they're

some of whom come from fairly
impoverished<00:02:33.190> backgrounds<00:02:34.150> they're<00:02:34.239> getting

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
impoverished backgrounds they're getting

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.059 
impoverished backgrounds they're getting
a<00:02:34.480> great<00:02:34.660> education<00:02:35.200> but<00:02:35.230> they<00:02:35.770> literally

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
a great education but they literally

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.059 
a great education but they literally
can't<00:02:36.489> afford<00:02:36.790> their<00:02:37.090> books<00:02:37.330> right<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:39.010> I

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
can't afford their books right so I

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:40.350 
can't afford their books right so I
think<00:02:39.160> there's<00:02:39.459> there's<00:02:39.850> a<00:02:39.970> real<00:02:40.150> argument

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
think there's there's a real argument

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.870 
think there's there's a real argument
there<00:02:40.800> conversely<00:02:41.800> the<00:02:42.190> schools<00:02:42.520> make<00:02:42.760> the

there conversely the schools make the

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.640 
there conversely the schools make the
argument<00:02:43.300> that<00:02:43.390> that<00:02:43.780> says<00:02:44.200> look<00:02:44.440> we're

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
argument that that says look we're

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.259 
argument that that says look we're
giving<00:02:44.890> them<00:02:45.010> an<00:02:45.100> education<00:02:45.220> sports<00:02:46.060> should

giving them an education sports should

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:47.790 
giving them an education sports should
be<00:02:46.390> for<00:02:46.570> the<00:02:46.660> love<00:02:46.840> of<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.080> they're<00:02:47.320> not<00:02:47.500> adults

yet<00:02:48.130> at<00:02:48.580> least<00:02:48.640> I<00:02:48.940> guess<00:02:49.090> technically<00:02:49.600> the

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
yet at least I guess technically the

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.330 
yet at least I guess technically the
freshmen<00:02:50.410> aren't<00:02:50.680> because<00:02:50.860> they're<00:02:50.980> you<00:02:51.250> know

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
freshmen aren't because they're you know

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.790 
freshmen aren't because they're you know
some<00:02:51.580> are<00:02:51.670> under<00:02:51.880> 18<00:02:52.209> and<00:02:53.080> and<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.650> they

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
some are under 18 and and that they

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.199 
some are under 18 and and that they
should<00:02:54.040> of<00:02:54.370> course<00:02:54.640> they<00:02:54.850> should<00:02:54.880> play

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
should of course they should play

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.449 
should of course they should play
they're<00:02:56.110> getting<00:02:56.440> world-class<00:02:56.739> education

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
they're getting world-class education

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.430 
they're getting world-class education
then<00:02:58.060> you<00:02:58.180> counter<00:02:58.600> that<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:58.810> you<00:02:59.019> say<00:02:59.200> but

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
then you counter that and you say but

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.350 
then you counter that and you say but
how<00:02:59.470> good<00:02:59.739> is<00:02:59.800> the<00:03:00.010> education<00:03:00.610> because

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
how good is the education because

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.150 
how good is the education because
oftentimes<00:03:01.780> these<00:03:02.140> kids<00:03:02.319> are<00:03:02.560> spending<00:03:02.860> so

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
oftentimes these kids are spending so

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.240 
oftentimes these kids are spending so
much<00:03:03.310> time<00:03:04.260> participating<00:03:05.260> in<00:03:05.380> sports<00:03:05.650> maybe

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
much time participating in sports maybe

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.250 
much time participating in sports maybe
and<00:03:06.580> there<00:03:06.850> was<00:03:06.940> there<00:03:07.209> was<00:03:07.330> even<00:03:07.540> in<00:03:07.690> part<00:03:08.200> of

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
and there was there was even in part of

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.390 
and there was there was even in part of
the<00:03:08.319> article<00:03:08.620> there<00:03:08.709> was<00:03:08.800> even<00:03:08.950> discussion

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
the article there was even discussion

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.979 
the article there was even discussion
that<00:03:09.519> the<00:03:09.880> students<00:03:10.239> are<00:03:10.360> picking<00:03:10.480> easier

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
that the students are picking easier

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.290 
that the students are picking easier
majors<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.130> that<00:03:12.280> they<00:03:12.400> can<00:03:12.670> devote<00:03:12.880> the<00:03:13.090> time

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
majors so that they can devote the time

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.270 
majors so that they can devote the time
so<00:03:13.600> I<00:03:13.810> don't<00:03:14.170> think<00:03:14.440> it's<00:03:14.590> clear-cut<00:03:15.010> but<00:03:15.160> I<00:03:15.220> do

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
their college experience so I think it

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.410

is<00:03:38.739> complicated<00:03:39.060> but<00:03:40.060> I<00:03:40.120> think<00:03:40.299> it's

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:40.420 
is complicated but I think it's

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.030 
is complicated but I think it's
important<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.840> discuss<00:03:41.140> because<00:03:41.650> these<00:03:41.799> are

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
important to discuss because these are

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.610

our<00:03:42.280> future<00:03:42.579> both<00:03:43.269> athletes<00:03:43.750> but<00:03:44.109> our<00:03:44.260> future

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
our future both athletes but our future

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.460
