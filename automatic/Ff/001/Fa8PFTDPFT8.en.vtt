Jumbo too but don't get them any ones
and<00:00:47.829> then<00:00:48.489> I<00:00:48.820> took<00:00:48.880> this<00:00:49.180> black<00:00:49.420> frosting<00:00:49.960> I

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
and then I took this black frosting I

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:51.389 
and then I took this black frosting I
wouldn't<00:00:50.320> recommend<00:00:50.410> this<00:00:50.829> type<00:00:51.070> of<00:00:51.190> black

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:51.399 
wouldn't recommend this type of black

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:52.920 
wouldn't recommend this type of black
frosting<00:00:51.910> because<00:00:52.030> it's<00:00:52.239> kind<00:00:52.450> of<00:00:52.510> hard<00:00:52.690> to<00:00:52.720> do

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
frosting because it's kind of hard to do

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.780 
frosting because it's kind of hard to do
but<00:00:53.200> any<00:00:53.500> black<00:00:53.739> frosting<00:00:54.160> will<00:00:54.280> work<00:00:54.489> and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
but any black frosting will work and

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.510 
but any black frosting will work and
then<00:00:55.390> just<00:00:55.690> draw<00:00:55.989> on<00:00:56.260> a<00:00:56.500> spooky<00:00:57.070> ghost<00:00:57.250> face

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
then just draw on a spooky ghost face

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.400 
then just draw on a spooky ghost face
which<00:00:57.760> is<00:00:57.790> basically<00:00:58.149> just<00:00:58.270> three<00:00:58.780> dots<00:00:59.020> like

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
which is basically just three dots like

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.940 
which is basically just three dots like
that<00:00:59.649> but<00:00:59.980> yeah<00:01:00.309> and<00:01:00.760> then<00:01:00.820> grab<00:01:01.809> a<00:01:02.140> chocolate
