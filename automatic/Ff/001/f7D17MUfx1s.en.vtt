00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.870

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.010
 d we minecraft has been updated again 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.650
 I do not kiss texture pack more I 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.689

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.160
 or I do not have a standard texts pack and 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.930
 so make up j now 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.570
 again at the crown is on it 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.059
 my statue that people did 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.010
 after the last minecraft video 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:37.890
 and what is here and what is on it 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.969
 step then you look like you can now 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.969
 already and we watched 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.289
 I look like it's just the pity 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:53.399
 crowns are on it and not the front 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:56.250
 ah look but yes it is serious 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.629
 no I still have emails from you 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.850
 you come in and still come 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:03.210
 very good emails inside so I was 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.820
 just smooth with watching who's there 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.040
 really going to be with it 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.979
 I'll wait a little longer with that 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.520
 and good emails are still coming 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.770
 within 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.700
 I still have a shortlist there 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.070
 people are coming 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.960
 but it is going in the right direction 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.600
 really the right way then we go something 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.720
 very fat and bet on the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.119
 thunder some food donate some food and 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.310
 if you eat a little more than we will do something whole 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.829
 fat this is it here on the spooky server 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.070
 and I actually come with today 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.630
 ask no you all love yes i have 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.570
 for the first time i just got that texture 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.010
 pack away this is kind of sweet 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:50.610
 Look it looks cool 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.790
 I am asking what would you do 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.860
 like me here in a separate world 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.200
 in the coil that server with a number 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.340
 people and who knows, we might expand that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:06.660
 eventually survived 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.729
 yes i am not so good at minecraft 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.880
 every time I do a survival series 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.850
 and then I don't know anything about it 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.420
 then I know something about it 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.060
 I learn something, and then eventually 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.440
 then it doesn't work that long anymore 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.590
 I forgot it all again 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.290
 and at that point it now makes sense 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:31.530
 that great to have a survival series 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:35.100

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.670
 responses press those like and yes i am 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.620
 very curious about your baby because me 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.340
 see it actually wants to sit alone 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.770
 become real 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.840

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.670

 whether it is still viewed a bit 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:10.500

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.629
 I can do that time I just can't 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.760

 5000 people to watch or whatever that 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.690
