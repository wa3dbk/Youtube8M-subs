today<00:03:26.550> in<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.790> paper<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.300> so<00:03:27.720> I<00:03:28.020> think<00:03:28.140> it's

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
today in the paper and so I think it's

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.050 
today in the paper and so I think it's
something<00:03:28.770> that<00:03:29.040> we<00:03:29.190> want<00:03:29.310> that<00:03:29.430> won't<00:03:29.790> be<00:03:29.940> the

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
something that we want that won't be the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.940 
something that we want that won't be the
