red buff it almost exactly the same time
and<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.340> reason<00:00:32.460> why<00:00:32.669> I'm<00:00:32.759> showing<00:00:32.910> you<00:00:33.059> this

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
and the reason why I'm showing you this

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.510 
and the reason why I'm showing you this
is<00:00:33.329> that<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.660> starting<00:00:34.020> root<00:00:34.800> for<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> jungler

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
is that the starting root for a jungler

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.250 
is that the starting root for a jungler
will<00:00:35.760> determine<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.570> rest<00:00:36.690> of<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.930> game<00:00:37.079> or

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
will determine the rest of the game or

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.049 
will determine the rest of the game or
determine<00:00:37.649> his<00:00:37.710> aggression<00:00:38.160> early<00:00:38.399> game<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.030> I

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
determine his aggression early game so I

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.549 
determine his aggression early game so I
usually<00:00:39.450> will<00:00:39.600> go<00:00:39.629> straight<00:00:39.840> for<00:00:39.989> my<00:00:40.110> race<00:00:40.290> a

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
usually will go straight for my race a

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.049 
usually will go straight for my race a
red<00:00:40.829> buff<00:00:41.070> and<00:00:41.280> then<00:00:41.399> look<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> gank<00:00:42.000> top

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
red buff and then look for a gank top

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.970 
red buff and then look for a gank top
lane<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:42.989> Jarvan<00:00:43.290> goes<00:00:43.469> straight<00:00:43.739> for<00:00:43.890> his

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
lane but Jarvan goes straight for his

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.010 
lane but Jarvan goes straight for his
blue<00:00:44.250> buff<00:00:44.460> neglecting<00:00:45.000> his<00:00:45.120> wolves<00:00:45.480> it'll

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
blue buff neglecting his wolves it'll

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.600 
blue buff neglecting his wolves it'll
give<00:00:46.140> him<00:00:46.230> an<00:00:46.350> early<00:00:46.620> level<00:00:46.890> 3<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.460> could

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
give him an early level 3 but it could

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.770 
give him an early level 3 but it could
set<00:00:47.760> him<00:00:47.820> behind<00:00:48.120> if<00:00:48.300> he<00:00:48.360> doesn't<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.629> any

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
set him behind if he doesn't get any

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.810 
set him behind if he doesn't get any

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
this is unsuccessful this could work in

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.380 
this is unsuccessful this could work in
our<00:01:04.379> favor<00:01:04.739> but<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.610> Natalie's<00:01:06.180> pushed

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
our favor but because Natalie's pushed

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.060 
our favor but because Natalie's pushed
so<00:01:06.540> far<00:01:06.570> up<00:01:06.869> it's<00:01:07.049> one<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.350> easiest<00:01:07.380> ganks

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
so far up it's one of the easiest ganks

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.450 
so far up it's one of the easiest ganks
and<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:09.150> sets<00:01:09.330> newly<00:01:09.720> wave<00:01:09.900> behind<00:01:10.439> and<00:01:10.799> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and this sets newly wave behind and the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.609 
and this sets newly wave behind and the
next<00:01:11.640> clip<00:01:11.850> shows<00:01:12.090> I'm<00:01:12.420> trying<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:13.110> respond<00:01:13.470> to
