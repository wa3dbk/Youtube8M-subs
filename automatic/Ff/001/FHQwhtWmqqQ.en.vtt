00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
raise prices because people think that

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.870 
raise prices because people think that
they're<00:02:35.180> making<00:02:35.330> money<00:02:35.600> off<00:02:35.870> it<00:02:35.900> all<00:02:36.230> versus

into a farce for the dumpling so now we

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.590 
into a farce for the dumpling so now we
stretched<00:04:42.420> out<00:04:42.600> four<00:04:42.870> different<00:04:43.230> ways<00:04:43.440> when

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
stretched out four different ways when

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.650 
stretched out four different ways when
is<00:04:45.600> it<00:04:45.900> traditionally<00:04:46.620> as<00:04:46.740> an<00:04:46.830> item<00:04:47.100> that

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:47.660 
is it traditionally as an item that

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.090 
is it traditionally as an item that
might<00:04:48.660> just<00:04:48.900> be<00:04:49.020> one<00:04:49.230> thing<00:04:49.500> I<00:04:49.680> know<00:04:49.920> that

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
might just be one thing I know that

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.970 
might just be one thing I know that
noodle<00:04:50.430> bar<00:04:50.580> suit<00:04:50.820> costs<00:04:51.120> have<00:04:51.240> risen<00:04:51.980> quite

noodle bar suit costs have risen quite

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.590 
noodle bar suit costs have risen quite
dramatically<00:04:53.490> actually<00:04:53.970> over<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.180> past<00:04:54.360> year

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
dramatically actually over the past year

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.840 
dramatically actually over the past year
in<00:04:54.690> the<00:04:54.720> house<00:04:54.870> oh<00:04:55.140> no<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:56.010> don't<00:04:56.550> want<00:04:56.670> to<00:04:56.760> we

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
in the house oh no I don't want to we

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.040 
in the house oh no I don't want to we

don't want to raise prices just for the
sake<00:04:58.260> of<00:04:58.290> raising<00:04:58.590> prices<00:04:58.920> to<00:04:59.370> counteract<00:04:59.880> the

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
sake of raising prices to counteract the

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.000 
sake of raising prices to counteract the
food<00:05:00.840> cost<00:05:01.050> we<00:05:01.320> make<00:05:01.530> up<00:05:01.710> that<00:05:01.860> ground

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
food cost we make up that ground

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.070 
food cost we make up that ground
somewhere<00:05:02.520> else<00:05:02.760> that's<00:05:03.330> basically<00:05:03.810> what<00:05:03.960> I'm

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
somewhere else that's basically what I'm

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.300 
somewhere else that's basically what I'm
looking<00:05:04.110> at

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
looking at

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.530 
looking at
we're<00:05:05.550> just<00:05:05.730> trying<00:05:06.000> to<00:05:06.060> find<00:05:06.300> ways<00:05:06.480> to

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
we're just trying to find ways to

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.570 
we're just trying to find ways to
stretch<00:05:07.140> it<00:05:07.290> out<00:05:07.350> more<00:05:07.740> you<00:05:08.040> know<00:05:08.280> whether

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
stretch it out more you know whether

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.860 
stretch it out more you know whether
it's<00:05:11.580> everything<00:05:11.850> like<00:05:12.090> we've<00:05:12.240> altered<00:05:12.450> a<00:05:12.720> lot

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
it's everything like we've altered a lot

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.920 
it's everything like we've altered a lot
of<00:05:13.020> different<00:05:13.380> things<00:05:14.150> for<00:05:15.150> since<00:05:15.419> the<00:05:15.630> the

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
of different things for since the the

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.600 
of different things for since the the
soup<00:05:16.320> noodle<00:05:17.040> bars<00:05:17.250> change<00:05:17.669> I<00:05:19.400> know<00:05:20.400> we're

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
soup noodle bars change I know we're

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:24.350 
soup noodle bars change I know we're
using<00:05:20.790> more<00:05:22.280> more<00:05:23.280> dried<00:05:23.550> shiitakes<00:05:24.150> right

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
using more more dried shiitakes right

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.270 
using more more dried shiitakes right
now<00:05:24.570> than<00:05:24.870> we<00:05:25.080> lured<00:05:25.290> during<00:05:25.590> these<00:05:25.770> we're

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
now than we lured during these we're

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:30.560 
now than we lured during these we're
we're<00:05:26.700> tweaking<00:05:26.910> around<00:05:27.180> with<00:05:27.510> ratios<00:05:29.570> for

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
we're tweaking around with ratios for

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:33.200 
we're tweaking around with ratios for
since<00:05:30.900> it's<00:05:31.800> just<00:05:32.160> making<00:05:32.340> it's<00:05:32.610> forcing<00:05:33.060> us

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
since it's just making it's forcing us

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.150 
since it's just making it's forcing us
to<00:05:33.240> maybe<00:05:34.020> be<00:05:34.200> more<00:05:34.380> creative<00:05:34.590> instead<00:05:35.040> of

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 
to maybe be more creative instead of

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:38.150 
to maybe be more creative instead of
frying<00:05:35.460> away<00:05:35.730> the<00:05:36.630> cooked<00:05:36.900> bacon<00:05:37.140> that<00:05:37.770> we<00:05:37.830> use

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 
frying away the cooked bacon that we use

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.060 
frying away the cooked bacon that we use
from<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.810> betting<00:05:39.810> scraps<00:05:40.110> in<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:40.620> ham<00:05:40.800> if

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 
from the betting scraps in the ham if

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:43.010 
from the betting scraps in the ham if
you<00:05:41.190> cook<00:05:41.400> bacon<00:05:41.640> in<00:05:41.940> and<00:05:42.270> what<00:05:42.510> in<00:05:42.690> a<00:05:42.810> pressure

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
you cook bacon in and what in a pressure

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.110 
you cook bacon in and what in a pressure
cooker<00:05:43.140> you're<00:05:43.950> gonna<00:05:44.100> get<00:05:44.280> more<00:05:44.460> flavor<00:05:44.760> out

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
cooker you're gonna get more flavor out

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.980 
cooker you're gonna get more flavor out
of<00:05:45.150> it<00:05:45.300> it<00:05:45.570> just<00:05:45.810> it's<00:05:46.110> just<00:05:46.290> a<00:05:46.500> fact<00:05:47.990> instead

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
of it it just it's just a fact instead

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:51.290 
of it it just it's just a fact instead
of<00:05:49.080> just<00:05:49.230> piling<00:05:49.800> in<00:05:50.220> bunch<00:05:50.610> of<00:05:50.730> bacon<00:05:50.910> in<00:05:51.180> the

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
of just piling in bunch of bacon in the

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.650 
of just piling in bunch of bacon in the
stockpot<00:05:52.400> and<00:05:53.400> after<00:05:53.880> that<00:05:54.000> you<00:05:54.270> can<00:05:54.300> make<00:05:54.540> an

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
stockpot and after that you can make an

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.140 
stockpot and after that you can make an
oil<00:05:55.140> out<00:05:55.440> of<00:05:55.470> that<00:05:55.620> whatever's<00:05:56.340> residual<00:05:56.880> so

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
oil out of that whatever's residual so

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.300 
oil out of that whatever's residual so

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:24.900 
I would rather us try to figure out how
not<00:06:21.010> to<00:06:21.640> raise<00:06:21.940> prices<00:06:22.180> on<00:06:22.480> go<00:06:23.320> I<00:06:23.920> think<00:06:24.520> we

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
not to raise prices on go I think we

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:26.130 
not to raise prices on go I think we
need<00:06:25.030> to<00:06:25.120> raise<00:06:25.300> prices<00:06:25.540> on<00:06:25.810> certain<00:06:26.110> things

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:26.140 
need to raise prices on certain things

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:28.200 
need to raise prices on certain things
but<00:06:26.530> we're<00:06:27.310> just<00:06:27.340> in<00:06:27.610> the<00:06:27.700> wait-and-see<00:06:27.910> mode

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:28.210 
but we're just in the wait-and-see mode

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:33.570 
but we're just in the wait-and-see mode
we're<00:06:28.840> gonna<00:06:29.790> try<00:06:31.560> right<00:06:32.560> that's<00:06:33.160> I<00:06:33.340> guess

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:33.580 
we're gonna try right that's I guess

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.330 
we're gonna try right that's I guess
wait<00:06:33.850> and<00:06:34.060> see<00:06:34.240> Australia<00:06:35.310> everywhere<00:06:36.310> but

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
wait and see Australia everywhere but

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.040 
wait and see Australia everywhere but
American<00:06:37.000> people<00:06:37.330> know<00:06:37.480> foods<00:06:37.810> it's

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
American people know foods it's

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.550 
American people know foods it's
expensive<00:06:38.500> on<00:06:38.830> Australia<00:06:39.610> food<00:06:39.850> is<00:06:40.000> expensive

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
expensive on Australia food is expensive

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.850 
expensive on Australia food is expensive
it<00:06:41.560> just<00:06:41.770> is<00:06:42.070> like<00:06:42.370> you<00:06:42.700> go<00:06:42.820> for<00:06:43.030> breakfast<00:06:43.450> I

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860 
it just is like you go for breakfast I

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.610 
it just is like you go for breakfast I
it's<00:06:44.860> it's<00:06:45.220> I<00:06:45.840> think<00:06:46.840> because<00:06:47.260> they<00:06:47.350> have<00:06:47.500> to

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:47.620 
it's it's I think because they have to

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:50.130 
it's it's I think because they have to
import<00:06:48.070> a<00:06:48.160> lot<00:06:48.280> of<00:06:48.460> things<00:06:48.670> or<00:06:49.660> I<00:06:49.720> don't<00:06:49.960> know

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:50.140 
import a lot of things or I don't know

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.080 
import a lot of things or I don't know
what<00:06:50.470> it<00:06:50.590> is<00:06:50.740> yet<00:06:50.980> but<00:06:51.040> food<00:06:51.670> is<00:06:51.820> just

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090 
what it is yet but food is just

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:54.720 
what it is yet but food is just
generally<00:06:52.480> more<00:06:52.660> expensive<00:06:53.380> in<00:06:54.040> for<00:06:54.430> instance

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:54.730 
generally more expensive in for instance

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:55.980 
generally more expensive in for instance
if<00:06:54.880> you<00:06:55.000> look<00:06:55.180> at<00:06:55.330> some<00:06:55.480> of<00:06:55.570> the<00:06:55.660> top

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990 
if you look at some of the top

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.980 
if you look at some of the top
restaurants<00:06:56.200> or<00:06:56.980> just<00:06:57.330> go<00:06:58.330> online<00:06:58.510> if<00:06:58.870> you

00:06:58.980 --> 00:06:58.990 
restaurants or just go online if you

00:06:58.990 --> 00:07:04.500 
restaurants or just go online if you
look<00:06:59.140> at<00:06:59.230> them<00:06:59.320> in<00:06:59.440> Australia<00:07:02.580> you'll<00:07:03.580> see<00:07:03.850> to

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:04.510 
look at them in Australia you'll see to

00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.090 
look at them in Australia you'll see to
the<00:07:04.660> dollar<00:07:04.870> is<00:07:05.050> relatively<00:07:05.500> the<00:07:05.620> same<00:07:05.860> I

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.100 
the dollar is relatively the same I

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.910 
the dollar is relatively the same I
think<00:07:06.310> it's<00:07:06.520> even<00:07:06.640> more<00:07:06.790> now<00:07:07.650> it's<00:07:08.650> pretty

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:08.920 
think it's even more now it's pretty

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.070 
think it's even more now it's pretty
expensive<00:07:09.130> like<00:07:09.670> your<00:07:10.030> order<00:07:10.510> or<00:07:10.660> non-trained

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080

00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:00.340 
settled down and we may have figured out

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:03.030 
settled down and we may have figured out
a<00:08:00.610> way<00:08:00.790> to<00:08:00.900> you<00:08:01.900> know<00:08:01.960> make<00:08:02.170> other<00:08:02.620> airlines

a way to you know make other airlines

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.830 
a way to you know make other airlines
not<00:08:03.340> just<00:08:03.610> sacrifice<00:08:04.060> but<00:08:04.300> make<00:08:04.480> it<00:08:04.660> better

00:08:04.830 --> 00:08:04.840 
not just sacrifice but make it better

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:08.600 
not just sacrifice but make it better
for<00:08:05.200> instance<00:08:06.190> you<00:08:06.520> know<00:08:06.550> like<00:08:07.200> you<00:08:08.200> know

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:08.610 
for instance you know like you know

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:13.050 
for instance you know like you know
using<00:08:09.610> more<00:08:09.880> off<00:08:10.150> cuts<00:08:10.510> and<00:08:10.810> stuff
