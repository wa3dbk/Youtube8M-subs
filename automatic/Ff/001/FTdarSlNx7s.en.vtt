00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.450
 How to do simple things very fast 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.340

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.390
 Would you like a little joy 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:50.040
 make and wanted a bag for 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.700
 the further did not fit so in itself 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.070
 looks good 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.250
 Schenk and I would like to know how 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.710
 that's it going on it's just the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.470
 instructions and everything you can find 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.420
 www ten.de there you can 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.519
 accordingly the whole ever made 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.670
 calculate and measure because leader 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.900
 mother passport and then you do something else 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.870
 it looks like that then that's it 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.790
 I can put in here 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:19.440
 that is now launched one side 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.760
 the other side 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.220
 and yes that is very very easy you 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.260
 I think that too with one 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.200
 Other fabric we do not have so retro 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.840
 are they the taste of yes me 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.670
 I'm also getting hopping stuff 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.070
 on the fabric de wacker here too 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.430
 the classic blue white or routes 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:45.840
 as a vision so we have here 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.620
 end effect 342 so that's me 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.130
 have cut the fabric de 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:53.050
 cut the back of you so 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.330
 outsider inside and the 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:58.420
 Connections one piece go on ok 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:01.720
 the ashes you want once in the 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.780
 break and now if all parts right 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.670
 on the right side the beautiful side is not laid 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.580
 put on the nice side exactly beautiful 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:13.630
 side by side the open edges 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:15.280
 outside inside so now we lay 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.420
 here also the beautiful side the right one 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.140
 side inside 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.920
 that means you only see the left side 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:25.090
 from the outside 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:26.170
 Now we are stuck that nothing 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.990
 can slip 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:32.020
 that went the needle so that the head behind 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.290
 inside out and you're doing now 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:39.550
 all around and then you are once 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:44.920
 completely everything around with 1 centimeter 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:50.680
 distance and leaves here 5 to 7 cm as 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:53.709
 if that means through this turn opening 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:55.330
 Drews then taken the end and have so 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.590
 finished and then I have to turn around 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.980
 Opening again to take that you 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.930
 also exactly normal sewing machines 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.390
 sting or succeed and then 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.070
 Can you cut the corners beforehand 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:09.040
 even before that at least a bit 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:11.590
 back and then you can go in 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.900
 theoretically, so you too each 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:17.550
 Deciding households around there quite creatively 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:21.120
 So try that thing is that 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.650
 used ok so cut documents 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.459
 cut out 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.110
 6 alex so beautiful also beautiful 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:33.690
 staking and taking everything is also 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.690
 here the opening exactly to the mouth 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.340
