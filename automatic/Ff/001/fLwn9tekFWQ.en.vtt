00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.830

 pretty good and good as they saw 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.039
 we are in a new script mode that is 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.990
 pretty cool and how they saw it again 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.939
 it is a wolf engine created by 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.930
 alexander the castle to which I command a 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.619
 greeting 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.810
 and I wish I could know how to create many 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.000
 I have very good ideas up to that but 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:01.439
 well that's not the point now the point 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.570
 now it's the wolves the wolves because there 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.100
 a mountain where there are several ways 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.539
 crafter among them the wolves but I 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.459
 I said because I want everyone else I 

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.140
 I just want a little wolf and ya and well 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.360
 it seems that alexandra read my mind 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.519
 so it's pretty cool and good 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.220
 how is it used because we need what 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.319
 that is the tumen and air mbps and there says 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.239
 translated by monsters droid yes yes 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.090
 using it because because I'm not 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:28.440
 gringo I do not know English and we would go 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:32.810
 to customized in ied items and we delete 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.360
 this and we must put 200 there is 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.000
 and quantity we do not add a 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.970
 complete and perfect and as you can see 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.310
 will come sticks but these is spanair 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.790
 wolf and nothing else is to touch on the floor and 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:49.700
 there a lobito lobito that you hit the 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.130
 tree get out of there and it's already good 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.980
 we can draw many wolves are supposed to 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.230
 every time he uses is the stick 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.930
 is removed but in this case I think that 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.269
 when you have a whole highlight you see 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:06.530
 there you can get an infinity of wolves and 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.810
 well they are really cows with texture 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.600
 and modified form but it's pretty 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.900
 great and ok here we already have our 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.549
 our army of wolves over there 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.459
 some died to see and see what 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.230
 happened here what wave exploded as 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.319
 popcorn or what to have removed from the 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.840
 remove team from ya look I have a card 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:29.269
 and not touching or we can not put is to put that 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.220
 unit and there they would be great 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.220
 could be put sound of the wolf 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.930
 as such but not everything can or can be 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.489
 that yes I can I have no idea I do not know 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.960
