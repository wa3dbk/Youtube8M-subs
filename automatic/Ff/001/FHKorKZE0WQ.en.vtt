00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:07.859
 Good here I 'm doing a video here 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.730
 to demonstrate how I used it 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.420
 the gopro helmet holder 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:17.640
 sure and the support to put on the chest and 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.600
 support was the same who did not do 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.970
 because the original accessories are 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.680
 a very high price and I believe that 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.680
 Such a simple thing does not justify you. 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.929
 will pay 150 180 reais to be able to 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.380
 support of this support here is what 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.380
 comes on the camera itself that comes on the 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.550
 I got her display of holes. 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.129
 in her 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.370
 I put this tape on this tape that was 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.100
 of leon notebook bag of my 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.020
 girlfriend she gave me I used the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.520
 her own daughter to be able to do 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.039
 chest adjustment 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.199
 these two coffee from an old backpack 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:57.840
 that I put uses also the 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.550
 buckles on the buckles I make the adjustment 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.640
 this kitchen that goes on the shoulder 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:05.689
 so I liked the result a lot 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.170
 camera gets pretty firm, does not shake 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:14.580
 give her a safety in the sun 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.890
 there for those who want to copy 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.170
 will 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.750
 I really liked the helmet I already have 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.110
 mt really wanted to put the 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.479
 support is primarily on the chin but 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.630
 he is very curved he is much shorter 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.490
 than the accompanying support and such was 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.890
 to choose to put on the side 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.070
 but the side has this detail a 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.140
 low relief here that the bracket 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.579
 does not enter completely then it is that 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.259
 would not have a very good experience and 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.899
 have to put it further back 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.060
 I did some tests before taking off 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.130
 holding with the same hand so that you can see 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.040
 if I was going to give myself a legal position if I stayed 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.290
 not out of focus out of position 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.329
 I wanted to do the filming here. 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.180
 when you have physical capacity but 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:02.729
 position he took the panel well and also 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.799
 takes up enough of the street 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.380
 the adhesive it is very resistant it 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.690
 fixes enough on the helmet the 20 minutes 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.440
 after the goalkeeper tried to calm and not 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.200
 get 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.920
 or the chance of the camera crash I believe 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.459
 that what 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.650
 be difficult to fall by or 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.260
 and if you hit something it will turn 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.380
 break support what I did in the box 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.890
 I made a hole and put these 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.630
 cordinhas that is of photographic camera 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.410
 that we use to be able to roll 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.630
 arm 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.790
 this mountain range is very resistant she 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.590
 does not break easily so you can take the 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.690
 I just took over two laps here in 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.519
 support and I passed the cord that 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.800
 I play there in the helmet 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.690
 so let's assume that the lipstick on 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.060
 something this camera it breaks the 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.530
 support it will be stuck by the 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.140
 Rope I will not lose mine. 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.209
 camera to avoid falling on the floor too. 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.519
 something damaged by impact 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.730
 so that's the right idea for who 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:02.340
 Did you like the video of a 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.810
 Favorite is there and no jewel for power. 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.780
 dissemination and help those who 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.269
 who has these doubts also if someone 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.730
 you have questions about how to do this support 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:12.480
 So much the support to put in the 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.640
 chest 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.810
 about fixing it and this idea 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.980
 also the cord 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.980
 Ok enough guys
