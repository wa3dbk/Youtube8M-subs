think<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.950> know<00:01:14.070> with<00:01:14.219> some<00:01:14.429> players<00:01:14.759> you<00:01:15.119> can

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
think you know with some players you can

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.870 
think you know with some players you can
be<00:01:15.810> pretty<00:01:16.109> direct<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.770> tell<00:01:16.920> them<00:01:17.100> what<00:01:17.280> what

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
be pretty direct and tell them what what

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.399 
be pretty direct and tell them what what
they<00:01:17.999> really<00:01:18.179> need<00:01:18.479> to<00:01:18.509> focus<00:01:18.749> on<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.259> get

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
they really need to focus on to get

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:20.569 
they really need to focus on to get
better<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.859> I<00:01:19.920> think<00:01:20.130> with<00:01:20.219> some<00:01:20.399> other

00:01:20.569 --> 00:01:20.579 
better and I think with some other

you know and I think it's hard to expect
kids<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:36.640> emotionally<00:02:37.360> handle<00:02:38.020> that<00:02:38.260> and

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:38.440 
kids to emotionally handle that and

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.590 
kids to emotionally handle that and
still<00:02:38.650> maintain<00:02:38.920> their<00:02:39.460> responsibilities<00:02:40.360> as

still maintain their responsibilities as

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:53.309 
still maintain their responsibilities as
