 tiny little spray that I buy them 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.659

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.049
 German perfumery that is here in the

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:03.190
 a top com 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.530

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.930
 for when a career of the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.429
 so it does not get bigger 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.940
 also if you break a nail because 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.010

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.380
 He knows to stick things to the best he can 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.770
 serve also and always put usually 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.800
 wearing a short top removes the following 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.200
 on some powders some powders 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.600
 Wipes wipes not how to 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.040

 These are wishes and nothing is always 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.930
 arriving is simple then I have a 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.930
 mirror 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.060
 that has a little bit of zoom up and 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:54.450
 down and down the normal and also 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.350
 always year in here and then already 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.480
 we are getting to the little things 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:59.480
 cortinitas I have another cream 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.860

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:12.990
 well as cocoa was super good I have 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:16.510

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:20.069
 I have three holes and one hair 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.069
 and here I have tribute 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:26.300
 thomas pink have a toothbrush 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:29.240

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.000
 stand up teeth and here in the pasta 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.920
 mini because when I go to eat some 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.170
 place something like that the chewing gum like that I do not 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.780
 it's enough that I need to wash my 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.880

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.739
 strips 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:54.569
 because this track is also quite 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.819
 important to get finite and it's not so much 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:59.840

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.840

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:08.730
 must-haves although I've left valued 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:11.819
