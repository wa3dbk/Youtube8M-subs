one<00:00:35.190> button<00:00:35.719> couldn't<00:00:36.719> be<00:00:36.780> simpler

one button couldn't be simpler

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.690 
one button couldn't be simpler
I<00:00:37.320> like<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> way<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.860> feels<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.190> your<00:00:38.250> hand<00:00:38.340> I

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
I like the way it feels in your hand I

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.520 
I like the way it feels in your hand I
like<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.940> form<00:00:39.180> factor<00:00:39.600> of<00:00:39.629> it<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:40.230> feels

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
like the form factor of it it feels

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.530 
like the form factor of it it feels
solid<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.250> like<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> fact<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> has<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> flat

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
solid I like the fact that it has a flat

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.540 
solid I like the fact that it has a flat
base<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.410> can<00:00:43.590> set<00:00:43.829> it<00:00:43.950> down<00:00:43.980> without<00:00:44.520> a

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
base so you can set it down without a

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.240 
base so you can set it down without a

great about the flip love the flip

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.020 
great about the flip love the flip
camera<00:01:10.380> but<00:01:10.920> I'm<00:01:11.010> switching<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.700> kodak

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
camera but I'm switching to the kodak

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.260 
camera but I'm switching to the kodak
zi8<00:01:12.500> this<00:01:13.500> is<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.770> kodak<00:01:14.100> it's<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.030> little

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
zi8 this is the kodak it's a little

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.499 
zi8 this is the kodak it's a little
thinner<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:15.930> wider<00:01:16.320> than<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.799> flip<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.509> it

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
thinner and wider than the flip and it

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.390 
thinner and wider than the flip and it
has<00:01:19.140> some<00:01:19.350> advantages<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:19.950> has<00:01:20.250> some

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.249 
disadvantages among its advantages it
can<00:01:23.280> shoot<00:01:23.460> in<00:01:23.670> higher<00:01:24.180> resolution<00:01:24.869> it<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.110> go

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
can shoot in higher resolution it can go

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.940 
can shoot in higher resolution it can go
at<00:01:25.759> 1080p<00:01:26.759> as<00:01:27.030> opposed<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.450> just<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.770> 720<00:01:28.770> like

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
at 1080p as opposed to just the 720 like

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.140 
at 1080p as opposed to just the 720 like
the<00:01:29.070> flip<00:01:29.869> it<00:01:30.869> has<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:32.009> ability<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.430> do<00:01:32.640> 60

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
the flip it has the ability to do 60

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.200 
the flip it has the ability to do 60
frames<00:01:33.390> per<00:01:33.509> second<00:01:34.049> at<00:01:34.170> 720p<00:01:34.670> which<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:36.030> great

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
frames per second at 720p which is great

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.420 
frames per second at 720p which is great
for<00:01:36.420> sports<00:01:36.659> or<00:01:36.869> fast-moving<00:01:37.430> fast-moving

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
ability to have more memory which is

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.630 
ability to have more memory which is
both<00:01:43.770> an<00:01:43.890> advantage<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.549> a<00:01:44.610> disadvantage

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
both an advantage and a disadvantage

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.610 
both an advantage and a disadvantage
that<00:01:45.180> disadvantages<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.229> to

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
that disadvantages you have to

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.960 
that disadvantages you have to
every<00:01:46.860> card<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.190> go<00:01:47.310> in<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:47.580> so<00:01:47.730> that's<00:01:47.880> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
every card to go in it so that's a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.340 
every card to go in it so that's a
little<00:01:48.120> extra<00:01:48.450> expense<00:01:48.810> but<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.080> can<00:01:49.170> put<00:01:49.320> a

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:02.550 
minor advantages in my book there are

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.710 
minor advantages in my book there are
three<00:02:02.790> things<00:02:03.000> about<00:02:03.120> it<00:02:03.330> though<00:02:03.450> that<00:02:03.630> are

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
three things about it though that are

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.200 
three things about it though that are
important<00:02:04.110> for<00:02:04.260> me<00:02:04.380> and<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.640> reasons<00:02:05.970> why<00:02:06.030> I'm

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
important for me and the reasons why I'm

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.750 
important for me and the reasons why I'm
switching<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:07.200> the<00:02:07.590> least<00:02:07.800> of<00:02:08.040> them<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.580> the

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
switching one the least of them is the

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:09.920 
switching one the least of them is the
fact<00:02:08.970> that<00:02:09.060> has<00:02:09.270> this<00:02:09.390> little<00:02:09.570> remote<00:02:09.869> control

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
fact that has this little remote control

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.620 
fact that has this little remote control
which<00:02:10.800> only<00:02:11.040> cost<00:02:11.280> about<00:02:11.400> ten<00:02:11.670> bucks<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.510> it's

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:12.630 
which only cost about ten bucks but it's

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.750 
which only cost about ten bucks but it's
really<00:02:12.780> handy<00:02:13.230> now<00:02:13.980> if<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:14.220> just<00:02:14.430> take<00:02:14.610> the

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
really handy now if you just take the

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.160 
really handy now if you just take the
camera<00:02:15.060> out<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.390> shoot<00:02:15.570> your<00:02:15.720> friends<00:02:16.050> this

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
camera out you shoot your friends this

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.480 
camera out you shoot your friends this
may<00:02:16.290> not<00:02:16.440> matter<00:02:16.620> to<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.860> but<00:02:16.920> if<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.190> do<00:02:17.340> what

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
may not matter to you but if you do what

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.550 
may not matter to you but if you do what
I<00:02:17.520> do<00:02:17.640> or<00:02:18.240> just<00:02:18.270> stand<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.930> your<00:02:19.140> living<00:02:19.380> room

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
I do or just stand in your living room

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.080 
I do or just stand in your living room
and<00:02:19.650> talk<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.070> camera<00:02:20.340> yourself<00:02:20.700> having

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
and talk to the camera yourself having

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.700 
and talk to the camera yourself having
the<00:02:21.180> remote<00:02:21.510> control<00:02:21.870> to<00:02:21.990> turn<00:02:22.020> it<00:02:22.260> on<00:02:22.410> and<00:02:22.470> off

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
the remote control to turn it on and off

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:24.410 
the remote control to turn it on and off
without<00:02:23.280> having<00:02:23.460> to<00:02:23.670> run<00:02:23.850> around<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.210> the<00:02:24.240> back

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
without having to run around to the back

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.450 
without having to run around to the back
of<00:02:24.570> the<00:02:24.630> camera<00:02:24.870> all<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.110> time<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.680> a<00:02:25.740> big<00:02:26.250> plus

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
of the camera all the time is a big plus

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:29.540 
of the camera all the time is a big plus
so<00:02:27.120> little<00:02:27.930> remote<00:02:28.170> is<00:02:28.410> cool<00:02:28.710> but<00:02:29.370> more

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
so little remote is cool but more

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.650 
so little remote is cool but more
importantly<00:02:30.000> for<00:02:30.210> me

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
importantly for me

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.230 
importantly for me
the<00:02:31.110> Kodak<00:02:31.440> has<00:02:32.100> a<00:02:32.130> little<00:02:32.400> switch<00:02:32.670> on<00:02:32.880> the<00:02:33.000> top

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
the Kodak has a little switch on the top

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.600 
the Kodak has a little switch on the top
that<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.780> can<00:02:33.930> flip<00:02:34.200> to<00:02:34.950> put<00:02:35.130> it<00:02:35.220> in<00:02:35.340> macro

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
that you can flip to put it in macro

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.790 
that you can flip to put it in macro
mode<00:02:35.940> Rick<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:36.630> focus<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.050> things<00:02:37.230> very<00:02:37.500> close

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
mode Rick and focus on things very close

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.490 
mode Rick and focus on things very close
now<00:02:38.400> both<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.700> flip<00:02:39.000> and<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.270> Kodak<00:02:39.660> normally

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
now both the flip and the Kodak normally

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.290 
now both the flip and the Kodak normally
focus<00:02:40.920> from<00:02:41.130> about<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.460> meter<00:02:41.880> away<00:02:42.120> to

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
focus from about a meter away to

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.410 
focus from about a meter away to
infinity<00:02:43.230> so<00:02:43.740> anything<00:02:44.160> inside<00:02:44.400> that<00:02:44.970> meter

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
infinity so anything inside that meter

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.530 
infinity so anything inside that meter
range<00:02:46.110> it<00:02:46.500> can't<00:02:46.710> really<00:02:46.800> focus<00:02:47.160> on<00:02:47.310> but<00:02:48.180> the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
range it can't really focus on but the

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.420 
range it can't really focus on but the
Kodak<00:02:48.900> has<00:02:49.170> this<00:02:49.290> little<00:02:49.440> switch<00:02:49.800> that<00:02:50.280> will

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
Kodak has this little switch that will

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.040 
Kodak has this little switch that will
make<00:02:50.550> it<00:02:50.670> focus<00:02:51.060> on<00:02:51.239> something<00:02:51.570> about<00:02:51.780> this

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
make it focus on something about this

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.479 
make it focus on something about this
far<00:02:52.290> away<00:02:52.470> from<00:02:52.530> the<00:02:52.770> lens<00:02:52.950> and<00:02:53.250> you<00:02:53.310> don't

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489 
far away from the lens and you don't

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:54.710 
far away from the lens and you don't
have<00:02:53.580> a<00:02:53.640> lot<00:02:53.760> of<00:02:53.790> flexibility<00:02:54.390> you<00:02:54.480> kind<00:02:54.690> of

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
have a lot of flexibility you kind of

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.260 
have a lot of flexibility you kind of
have<00:02:54.840> to<00:02:54.900> be<00:02:55.020> just<00:02:55.350> right<00:02:55.620> at<00:02:55.830> that<00:02:55.920> spot<00:02:56.270> but

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270 
have to be just right at that spot but

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.090 
have to be just right at that spot but
this<00:02:57.630> matters<00:02:57.989> a<00:02:58.020> lot<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.290> me<00:02:58.560> because<00:02:58.770> if<00:02:59.010> you

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
this matters a lot to me because if you

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.710 
this matters a lot to me because if you
watch<00:02:59.310> my<00:02:59.489> tutorials<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.209> know<00:03:00.330> one<00:03:00.510> of<00:03:00.540> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
watch my tutorials you know one of the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.270 
watch my tutorials you know one of the
things<00:03:00.750> I'd<00:03:01.020> like<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.260> do<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.590> show<00:03:01.739> close-ups

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
things I'd like to do is show close-ups

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.970 
things I'd like to do is show close-ups
of<00:03:02.459> camera<00:03:03.330> controls<00:03:03.720> or<00:03:03.959> flash<00:03:04.470> unit

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
of camera controls or flash unit

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.310 
of camera controls or flash unit
controls<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.700> I<00:03:06.090> simply<00:03:06.510> cannot<00:03:06.810> take<00:03:07.080> those

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
controls and I simply cannot take those

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.100 
controls and I simply cannot take those
close-ups<00:03:07.860> with<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.310> flip<00:03:08.489> camera<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:09.110> the

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
close-ups with the flip camera and the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.220 
close-ups with the flip camera and the
Kodak<00:03:10.440> can<00:03:10.800> do<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.970> that's<00:03:12.450> a<00:03:12.540> huge<00:03:12.690> huge

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
Kodak can do it so that's a huge huge

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.000 
Kodak can do it so that's a huge huge
plus<00:03:13.470> and<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:14.580> last<00:03:14.820> thing<00:03:15.239> is<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:16.560> Kodak

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
plus and the last thing is the Kodak

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.030 
plus and the last thing is the Kodak
allows<00:03:17.280> you<00:03:17.459> to<00:03:17.520> use<00:03:17.700> an<00:03:17.940> external<00:03:18.480> microphone

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
allows you to use an external microphone

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.280 
allows you to use an external microphone
the<00:03:20.040> flip<00:03:20.580> you're<00:03:20.850> listening<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.450> me<00:03:21.690> on<00:03:22.050> the

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
the flip you're listening to me on the

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:23.750 
the flip you're listening to me on the
internal<00:03:22.770> microphone<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.370> flip<00:03:23.610> right

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:35.210 
need to use an external microphone and I
actually<00:04:33.690> recommend<00:04:34.020> the<00:04:34.410> flip<00:04:34.680> over<00:04:34.950> the

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
actually recommend the flip over the

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.900 
actually recommend the flip over the
Kodak<00:04:35.580> because<00:04:35.790> it's<00:04:36.510> so<00:04:36.840> simple<00:04:37.910> incredibly

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
Kodak because it's so simple incredibly

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.510 
Kodak because it's so simple incredibly
user-friendly<00:04:39.530> it<00:04:40.530> feels<00:04:40.800> good<00:04:41.010> it's<00:04:41.250> solid

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
user-friendly it feels good it's solid

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.810 
user-friendly it feels good it's solid
it<00:04:42.270> costs<00:04:42.690> a<00:04:42.720> little<00:04:42.840> less<00:04:43.190> all<00:04:44.190> those<00:04:44.430> reasons

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
it costs a little less all those reasons

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.060 
it costs a little less all those reasons
make<00:04:45.090> me<00:04:45.270> favor<00:04:45.510> the<00:04:45.690> flip<00:04:45.960> for<00:04:46.470> just<00:04:46.650> an<00:04:46.770> easy

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
make me favor the flip for just an easy

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.130 
make me favor the flip for just an easy
to<00:04:47.220> use<00:04:47.250> pocket<00:04:47.820> camera<00:04:48.180> but<00:04:48.600> if<00:04:48.720> you<00:04:48.810> need<00:04:48.990> the

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:49.140 
to use pocket camera but if you need the

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.290 
to use pocket camera but if you need the
extra<00:04:49.170> features<00:04:49.800> that<00:04:50.160> I<00:04:50.370> need<00:04:50.670> especially

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
the external microphone and the macro

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.180 
the external microphone and the macro
ability<00:04:54.060> then<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:55.110> Kodak<00:04:55.440> is<00:04:55.620> the<00:04:55.740> camera<00:04:56.010> for
