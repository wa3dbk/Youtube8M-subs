 beautiful tree in the entrance 

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.800
 but Bob's woody plants are not only fascinating in spring with the delicate flowers No 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.830
 in summer, its foliage plays with the sunlight and later in the year yes 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.919
 he can then harvest the fruits 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.460
 in this case, to be too big 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.369
 whoever in his garden has no place to be commissioned handsome Probst 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.250
 Do not miss out on all this 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.370
 it also gives for small children 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.030
 even for the dripping hunt for Waldbrunn and terrace pretty of 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:40.780
 Sparta 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:41.710
 and so had 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.970
 keep the small and still bear plenty of fruit 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
 even the empty memory like for example 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.800
 Johannes Peil

 what does a typical Beijing look like? 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.370
 The claim takes up little space and can also be in Coesfeld 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.970
 feels even in partial shade 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.810
 Depending on the variety, its fruits can already be seen in early summer 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.290
 for smaller gardens or prof 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.620
 In addition, the plant from kg works only in reports, especially in reports 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.230
 150 high 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.240
 Frank Naber normal woman 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.110

 justified 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.560
 Bet the Symbian set the sap on alcohol or patio 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.150
 of course only in the pot 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.560
 It is important that the planter as large as possible 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.050
 all other woody plants are the top pulled 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.920
 the planter must be holed 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.260
 with it excess water 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.550
 so may the choice 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.450
