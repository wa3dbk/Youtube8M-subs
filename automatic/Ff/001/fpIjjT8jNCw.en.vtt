 bottle of champagne because I have 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.669

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.660
 we will still have a lot of chocolate to 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.220
 liquidate and I hope I would take 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.710
 not too much wood because there are some 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.960

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.020
 Christmas socks that have not yet

 start another it's going to be something else 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.340
 I will also talk about my projects 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.050
 for 2015 but hey I do not want everything you 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.449
 so unveil that it will be the surprise to 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.920
 every moment first of all are you tube 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.110
 what did I do I even passed 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.060
 a big cap in my life so much in my 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.310
 professional life little sentimental 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.380
 when I moved south to come 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.599
 in the Parisian suburbs for the sole purpose 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.890
 to come live with is never so 

00:01:15.599 --> 00:01:18.420
 it was to do again I do it again 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.110
 it's wonderful to live with 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.599
 someone we love 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.800
 then there was a job so I 

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:24.780
 worked at camaÃ¯eu 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.759
 maybe it's not necessarily the job 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.140
 of my dreams but I'm still in 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.420
 the fashion world I like it too 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.160
 a lot and then good I have a lot of 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.440
 next time to make my videos 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.880
 it depends on the sales period in 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:37.319
 out of that on youtube I still 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.459
 realized a lot of things that I 

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.770
 I was not expecting to reach 

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:42.090
 this year for example the 10000 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.310
 already subscribers something 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.530
 wonderful but first opening of 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.700
 booster excess wizard on the chain because 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.440
 that it's true that I never had 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.940
 done and that beat I wanted to me 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.470
 launch our if it's really very expensive 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.660
 thing that I could not do at each 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.099
 times so the 10,000 subscribers now 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.090
 currently the fourteen thousand subscribers 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:59.970
 that I had just before the new 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.560
 year ago there were the 1000 mention I like 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.629
 on the facebook page and thank you 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.580
 a lot for that it's also a hood 

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:06.420
 even if nothing does not cross this 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.369
 that everyone does not necessarily have 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.679
 facebook there are still a lot of things 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.239
 to list there was the project japan expo 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:13.830
 also where it was really but 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.870
 huge because the other times where i 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.880
 went the other years I can not 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.920
 the Pikachu while I was making 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.180
 amman and defense note for those who 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.280
 I know who knows that he knows 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.290
 no reason and there was no 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.840
 I was disguised as a pikachu actually 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.890
 but it was the first year that I 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.330
 met a lot of people 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.860
 because before I went with friends 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.610
 and it stopped there we put for and the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.170
 stands etc 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.910
 but there I met several 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.860
 people I knew and others 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.280
 not who knew me via my channel 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.740
 Youtube 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.660
 it was just huge eventually I 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.370
 spent my day talking with everyone 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.110
 world so supposed to go further in 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.910
 the floors is actually met 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.870
 a lot of friends youtuber I sell 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.760
 a lot to everything I saw 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.460
 Besides, I'm not going to lie down but 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.950
 especially to be desired 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.270
 because after that japan expo we could get 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.830
 see many times we have made 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.320
 restaurants is that of themselves 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.850
 resto we got a few 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.440
 evenings she is pure she could come 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.330
 at home by my collection et cetera 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.310
 talk with the youngsters it was 

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:09.530
 really super nice and not to mention 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.540
 also the ok mone challenge that you have 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.530
 by the way for to always appreciate 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.300
 for the event of the japan expo 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.220
 I had fifteen this opportunity cards 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.720
 visit for young people and myself 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.220
 Besides, it was not done before I 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.690
 am very happy to have launched this 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.400
 idea because a lot of people get 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.660
 put to it that it's great at 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.460
 lesser to everyone to be small map of 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.900
 visit I had this idea there because 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:29.150
 before I was German photographer 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.440
 counted down necessarily it works by the 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.090
 word of mouth and if we want to be 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.830
 customers it is necessary to make small 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.900
 business cards that's it's pauline is 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.520
 from there I also wanted you 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:39.610
 talk about the faq i know i'm going 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.480
 launch late 2014 and that normally 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.370
 I should have already taken her out 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.620
 she is not ready I tell you and 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.240
 texting is not ready I absolutely 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.620
 nothing done on it I shot a lot 

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:50.050
 sequences because concretely that 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.340
 really takes two hours of filming 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.170
 there are too many questions I try to 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.440
 sort is good but it's going 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.390
 arrive 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.880
 you do not worry it's already planned 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.530
 next in relation to the video results 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.640
 christmas contest i do not know if you 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.500
 are aware thousands of news 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.330
 laws that is passed on youtube which 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.070
 consists of no longer doing the competition on 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.120
 his chain which is a shame because 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:09.680
 it's a way for me of you 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.210
 thank you for your activity on my 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.070
 chain be the subscriptions to 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.320
 the elite the comments and sharing of 

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.850
 short solid videos passing the 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.170
 contest is still active do not you 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.760
 not worry but I would put the 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:20.780
 contest results on my page 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:22.100
 Facebook 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.900
 I know you do not have any facebook 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.610
 so it's delicate so what I 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.500
 could exceptionally be that I 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.660
 will contact me by private message 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.850
 youtube the winners of this contest 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.560
 now I'm going to address the subject of 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.060
 meet up actually the subscriber meetings 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.470
 because I will have some but 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.910
 kidney who asked me where is that 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.360
 I said and if it was possible to 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:41.090
 meet 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.440
 if instead to offer me their little 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:43.850
 gift if instead of sending a 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.410
 mail ci could you met 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:47.120
 on occasions where to spend a day 

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.280
 with me it's true that I had launched 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:51.020
 the idea also in relation to challenges 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:53.140
 subscribers because that's when 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.310
 where I had suggested to my subscribers 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.510
 participate with me to be able to 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.170
 to meet at the same time 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.940
 it was two birds and two birds 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:03.110
 validated by the idea of there after 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.600
 it's true that there were midcaps 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.020
 among americans at angel phoenix 

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.970
 etc. 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.919
 and suddenly it's true we're going to ask 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.480
 more and more the question to know me 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:13.190
 meet spend a day with me 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.169
 so I will actually do some 

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.550
 first time dating will be done 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.290
 obviously on paris 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.730
 Then I will try to go on nantes 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:21.020
 because I have family on nantes 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.390
 I will try to go to lyon also 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:24.740
 angers of three people there and then 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.290
 then to us parents living near 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:29.210
 of Avignon it will certainly be possible 

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:30.350
 we'll see that together then obviously 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:33.260
 who says 2000s 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:35.480
 10 perpetuate the tradition of cards 

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:37.250
 pokemon of the pikachu and its pieces 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:38.780
 calm and pikachu because I am 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.010
 aware that I certainly need you 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.770
 beard and from time to time with my 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:45.530
 pigalle collection my obsession for 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:47.240

 and there will be other small ones 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.960
 concept that I developed that I 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.370
 written elsewhere in the youtube book 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:03.350

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.690

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:23.900

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:28.550
 that the points will be smoldering 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.080

00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.660

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.130
 time schedules there we noticed that it 

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.510
 you like it and we like it too 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.950

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.170

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:40.700
