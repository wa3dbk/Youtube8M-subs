found Jeff and the background here it's

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.230 
found Jeff and the background here it's
got<00:01:29.990> me<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.679> it'll<00:01:30.979> do<00:01:31.159> some<00:01:31.369> auto<00:01:31.640> detection

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 
got me and it'll do some auto detection

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.289 
got me and it'll do some auto detection
so<00:01:32.719> it<00:01:32.869> will<00:01:33.369> do<00:01:34.369> auto<00:01:34.549> detect<00:01:34.939> based<00:01:35.119> on

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
so it will do auto detect based on
