00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.770
 great as usual today we get 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.300
 found for the top 10 of the week 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.470
 with super original clips 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.630
 frankly I say I think you 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.160
 will appreciate and right after there will be 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:28.420
 my top 10 this challenge so if ever 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.810
 to stay around that would make me 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.400
 pleasure 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.090
 here I hope you will spend a 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.130
 good time good viewing ok we start 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.870
 in the 10th place loca stenting that goes 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.550
 come make us a little I do not know 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.410
 what is it called sideways rolling 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.540
 a side slide taking a wall so 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.860
 and then he's going to come under 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.629
 several angles where I found that 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.809
 original was already nice for a 10th 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:50.859
 place well played to you 9th place so I 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:52.090
 did not rank better than satobus 

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:54.429
 size because I think he would have 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.809
 could do the top of the building I think 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:57.070
 that it is possible but otherwise 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.989
 case he made us a beautiful jump 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.579
 with a well- dressed reception well played 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:05.650
 to you number 8 e gx recon who comes with 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.330
 his bike that taps sports to make a 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.680
 double even on a wall then stolen 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.450
 on this small building it was still 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.730
 pretty well played to you a bmx clips 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.500
 the most abusing I've seen rsi s he is going 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.900
 come and make us a whole binz he goes 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.220
 topple his buddy he will leave for 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.550
 go back to frank slide for this 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.200
 fault 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:28.450
 it was a crazy grain 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.280
 well played number 6 makuza 75 that happens 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.180
 thoroughly osiris so I did not know what 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.460
 that he wanted to do at the beginning in 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.110
 clashes and watch this guys he 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.400
 will come down his little climb 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.360
 bang the nose of the car to steal 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.490
 part the vehicles they 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.360
 warehoused it was very original well 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.680
 play number 4 frieze that arrives with his 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.600
 little motorcycle that wants to make him one more 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.330
 very original thing slide on a bag 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.800
 slide on the other hero jumps and boom the 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.390
 triple slight that was it 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.470
 a triple slide so frankly well 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.120
 played it was really beautiful number 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.590
 at three o'clock the hours then 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.090
 not release which indicated he wished 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.040
 of the building under construction which is very 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.930
 very high to go I received you 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:06.460
 lets guess on the crane without falling 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.660
 you had to do it a lot of times 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.400
 any case well played 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.050
 so that's completely absurd 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:13.640
 third place is a name I arrive 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.630
 not to pronounce but it does not matter the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.370
 clip is so epic 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.660
 so the guy sees me that a truck 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.910
 with the application of trailer which will 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.350
 do you gonna look at it for yourself 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.790
 we make a frontflip with little 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.780
 trucks and land in addition to the 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.440
 roads frankly it's enough 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.420
 incredible well played at you number of 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.220
 sir times of watching this with 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.990
 his friend Djoko I think he told me 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.880
 who will roll on the side he will pass 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.950
 under several dump trucks for 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.200
 then go to resauter land in a 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.820
 truck is obviously waiting for his buddy 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.020
 what is a stunt team and 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.220
 boom you'll have stayed two in the 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.450
 truck frankly that's quite 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.450
 amazing well played guys 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.830

 said the top 10 was not top 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.800
 I quite agree with you 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.750

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.970

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.220

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.050
 we take off a psychopath for 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.300
 go to land watch that guys a 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.860
 precision the same frankly that 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.540
 deserves a largely first place 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.610
 that on val near all other stone 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.680
