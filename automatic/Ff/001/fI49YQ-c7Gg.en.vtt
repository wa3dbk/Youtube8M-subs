00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
I've dealt with it so this first one is

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.389 
I've dealt with it so this first one is
on<00:00:37.739> integrating<00:00:38.520> 2d<00:00:39.030> images<00:00:39.660> into<00:00:40.320> cinema<00:00:41.160> 4d

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
on integrating 2d images into cinema 4d

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.580 
on integrating 2d images into cinema 4d
scenes<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.809> there's<00:00:43.020> some<00:00:43.170> things<00:00:43.440> that

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
scenes and and there's some things that

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.979 
scenes and and there's some things that
might<00:00:43.739> come<00:00:43.920> up<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.340> some<00:00:44.640> tags<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.329> fix<00:00:45.570> it<00:00:45.780> so

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
might come up and some tags to fix it so

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.630 
might come up and some tags to fix it so
let's<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.350> get<00:00:46.440> right<00:00:46.590> to<00:00:46.860> it<00:00:46.890> here<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> have

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
let's just get right to it here I have

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.430 
let's just get right to it here I have
the<00:00:47.879> scene<00:00:48.120> that's<00:00:48.270> already<00:00:48.510> set<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.289> a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the scene that's already set up it's a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.069 
the scene that's already set up it's a
couple<00:00:49.739> numbers<00:00:49.950> coming<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:51.329> it's<00:00:51.750> lights

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
couple numbers coming in and it's lights

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.110 
couple numbers coming in and it's lights
and<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.469> camera<00:00:52.649> swinging<00:00:53.190> around<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.730> they

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
and a camera swinging around and they

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.330 
and a camera swinging around and they
have<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> plane<00:00:54.480> effector<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.350> rotate<00:00:56.190> them

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
have a plane effector to rotate them

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.099 
have a plane effector to rotate them
into<00:00:56.550> place<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.120> let's<00:00:57.360> just<00:00:57.600> take<00:00:57.690> a<00:00:57.750> look<00:00:57.960> at

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
into place so let's just take a look at

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.840 
into place so let's just take a look at
this<00:00:58.260> and<00:00:58.620> cut<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.010> there's<00:00:59.250> our<00:00:59.370> shot<00:00:59.699> and

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
this and cut it there's our shot and

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.520 
this and cut it there's our shot and
I'll<00:00:59.940> do<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.090> quick<00:01:00.390> shift<00:01:00.719> render<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.289> kind<00:01:01.500> of

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
I'll do a quick shift render to kind of

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.590 
I'll do a quick shift render to kind of
get<00:01:01.680> an<00:01:01.770> idea<00:01:01.859> what's<00:01:02.309> going<00:01:02.579> on<00:01:02.670> here<00:01:02.730> so<00:01:03.510> we

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
get an idea what's going on here so we

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.299 
get an idea what's going on here so we
have<00:01:03.750> this<00:01:03.870> little<00:01:04.049> scene<00:01:04.409> and<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.220> what

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
have this little scene and this is what

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.320 
have this little scene and this is what
we're<00:01:05.400> looking<00:01:05.580> at<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> lights<00:01:05.909> are<00:01:06.060> probably

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
we're looking at the lights are probably

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.060 
we're looking at the lights are probably
too<00:01:06.540> blown<00:01:06.780> out<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.200> whatever<00:01:07.409> that's<00:01:07.770> okay

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
too blown out but whatever that's okay

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.670 
too blown out but whatever that's okay
and<00:01:08.310> say<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.970> want<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.299> integrate<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:10.200> 2d

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
and say that we want to integrate a 2d

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.219 
and say that we want to integrate a 2d
product<00:01:11.460> image<00:01:11.850> into<00:01:12.180> this<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.810> don't<00:01:12.960> have<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
product image into this we don't have a

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.109 
product image into this we don't have a
whole<00:01:13.590> 3d<00:01:13.890> model<00:01:14.310> and<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.580> comes<00:01:14.790> up<00:01:14.909> pretty

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
whole 3d model and this comes up pretty

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.420 
whole 3d model and this comes up pretty
often<00:01:15.330> you<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.600> get<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> flat<00:01:16.170> photo<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.009> I

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
often you just get a flat photo and I

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.830 
often you just get a flat photo and I
don't<00:01:17.610> want<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:17.909> do<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.150> After<00:01:18.420> Effects<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:18.780> I

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
don't want to do in After Effects so I

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.149 
don't want to do in After Effects so I
want<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.110> reflections<00:01:19.650> and<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> don't<00:01:19.920> want<00:01:20.130> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
want the reflections and I don't want to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.249 
want the reflections and I don't want to
have<00:01:20.280> to<00:01:20.340> send<00:01:20.549> stuff<00:01:20.790> back<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.150> forth<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.750> how

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
have to send stuff back and forth so how

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.690 
have to send stuff back and forth so how
would<00:01:22.409> I<00:01:22.439> do<00:01:22.560> that<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:23.040> some<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.400> problems

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
would I do that and some of the problems

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.980 
would I do that and some of the problems
that<00:01:23.729> come<00:01:23.939> up<00:01:24.000> along<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.630> way<00:01:24.750> with

just made and for the Alpha I'm also
going<00:02:25.690> to<00:02:25.780> use<00:02:26.290> that<00:02:26.500> same<00:02:26.709> image<00:02:26.920> so<00:02:27.160> it

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
spec because I don't want it reflecting

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.120 
spec because I don't want it reflecting
because<00:02:31.480> it's<00:02:31.630> just<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.870> flat<00:02:32.170> image<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.800> then

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
because it's just a flat image and then

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.920 
because it's just a flat image and then
I'll<00:02:33.250> just<00:02:33.400> drag<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.970> onto<00:02:34.150> my<00:02:34.269> plane<00:02:34.630> and

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
I'll just drag that onto my plane and

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.800 
I'll just drag that onto my plane and
it's<00:02:35.470> gonna<00:02:35.560> look<00:02:35.739> huge<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:36.370> I<00:02:36.430> can<00:02:36.700> just<00:02:37.480> scale

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
it's gonna look huge so I can just scale

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.600 
it's gonna look huge so I can just scale
it<00:02:37.840> down<00:02:38.019> it<00:02:38.349> because<00:02:38.530> it's<00:02:38.680> defaulted<00:02:39.190> to<00:02:39.310> UV

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
it down it because it's defaulted to UV

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.430 
it down it because it's defaulted to UV
texture<00:02:39.940> it's<00:02:40.360> gonna<00:02:40.540> scale<00:02:40.870> to<00:02:41.049> the<00:02:41.140> front<00:02:41.380> of

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
texture it's gonna scale to the front of

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.229 
texture it's gonna scale to the front of
it<00:02:41.560> which<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:41.950> fine<00:02:42.220> that's<00:02:42.430> what<00:02:42.790> I<00:02:42.819> wanted

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
it which is fine that's what I wanted

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.150 
it which is fine that's what I wanted
now<00:02:43.480> if<00:02:43.569> I<00:02:43.629> do<00:02:43.720> a<00:02:43.780> quick<00:02:43.840> option<00:02:44.470> our<00:02:44.590> render

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
now if I do a quick option our render

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.699 
now if I do a quick option our render
and<00:02:45.819> take<00:02:46.060> a<00:02:46.090> look<00:02:46.330> at<00:02:46.450> this<00:02:46.599> we<00:02:47.440> can<00:02:47.470> see<00:02:47.590> that

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
and take a look at this we can see that

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.559 
and take a look at this we can see that
we<00:02:47.890> run<00:02:48.099> into<00:02:48.250> a<00:02:48.340> bit<00:02:48.580> of<00:02:48.700> a<00:02:48.760> problem<00:02:49.239> is<00:02:49.390> if<00:02:49.540> we

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 
we run into a bit of a problem is if we

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:51.839 
we run into a bit of a problem is if we
look<00:02:49.780> at<00:02:49.900> our<00:02:50.049> original<00:02:50.110> VCR<00:02:51.040> it's<00:02:51.340> kind<00:02:51.790> of

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
look at our original VCR it's kind of

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.420 
look at our original VCR it's kind of
grayish<00:02:52.390> and<00:02:52.720> awesome<00:02:53.319> as<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.680> was<00:02:53.829> in<00:02:54.069> the<00:02:54.160> 80s

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
grayish and awesome as it was in the 80s

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.520 
grayish and awesome as it was in the 80s
and<00:02:54.700> because<00:02:55.510> our<00:02:55.630> lights<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.200> are<00:02:56.290> lighting

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 
and because our lights that are lighting

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:57.809 
and because our lights that are lighting
our<00:02:56.620> numbers<00:02:57.010> it's<00:02:57.190> getting<00:02:57.400> this<00:02:57.519> kind<00:02:57.730> of

00:02:57.809 --> 00:02:57.819 
our numbers it's getting this kind of

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:59.460 
our numbers it's getting this kind of
reddish<00:02:58.150> tint<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.569> that<00:02:58.720> might<00:02:58.870> not<00:02:58.900> be<00:02:59.049> what

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
reddish tint and that might not be what

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:00.930 
reddish tint and that might not be what
we<00:02:59.620> want<00:02:59.950> and<00:03:00.190> if<00:03:00.280> you're<00:03:00.430> working<00:03:00.700> with<00:03:00.819> a

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.289 
client project they probably wouldn't
want<00:03:02.470> their<00:03:02.680> awesome<00:03:03.069> VCRs<00:03:03.549> to<00:03:03.910> look<00:03:04.060> red

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
want their awesome VCRs to look red

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.089 
want their awesome VCRs to look red
because<00:03:04.630> that's<00:03:04.720> not<00:03:04.900> how<00:03:05.049> they<00:03:05.170> look<00:03:05.410> so<00:03:05.680> so<00:03:06.069> a

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:06.099 
because that's not how they look so so a

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:07.890 
because that's not how they look so so a
little<00:03:06.400> trick<00:03:06.610> I<00:03:06.730> kind<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.239> stumbled<00:03:07.810> across

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
little trick I kind of stumbled across

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.600 
little trick I kind of stumbled across
when<00:03:08.349> I<00:03:08.410> was<00:03:08.530> playing<00:03:08.799> with<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.010> textures<00:03:09.400> and

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
when I was playing with the textures and

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.640 
when I was playing with the textures and
probably<00:03:09.940> didn't<00:03:10.239> make<00:03:10.390> up<00:03:10.660> but<00:03:11.200> is<00:03:11.319> a<00:03:11.349> good

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
probably didn't make up but is a good

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.280 
probably didn't make up but is a good
thing<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.190> at<00:03:12.459> least<00:03:12.640> I<00:03:12.910> figured<00:03:13.870> out<00:03:14.019> to

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
thing that at least I figured out to

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.430 
thing that at least I figured out to
deal<00:03:14.590> with<00:03:14.709> this<00:03:14.829> is<00:03:15.040> on<00:03:15.459> the<00:03:16.060> lights<00:03:16.390> if<00:03:16.750> we<00:03:17.290> go

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
deal with this is on the lights if we go

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.120 
deal with this is on the lights if we go
to<00:03:18.060> project<00:03:19.060> we<00:03:19.540> can<00:03:19.750> exclude<00:03:20.079> objects<00:03:21.010> so

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
to project we can exclude objects so

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.610 
to project we can exclude objects so
they<00:03:21.250> don't<00:03:21.609> light<00:03:21.940> those<00:03:22.720> objects<00:03:23.290> so<00:03:23.380> if<00:03:23.500> we

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
they don't light those objects so if we

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.349 
they don't light those objects so if we
just<00:03:23.859> have<00:03:23.950> this<00:03:24.100> flat<00:03:24.430> image<00:03:24.760> we<00:03:24.940> don't<00:03:25.150> want

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
just have this flat image we don't want

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.090 
just have this flat image we don't want
that<00:03:25.569> to<00:03:25.750> catch<00:03:26.109> the<00:03:26.290> light<00:03:26.440> so<00:03:26.680> we<00:03:26.799> can<00:03:26.829> just

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.100 
that to catch the light so we can just

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.819 
that to catch the light so we can just
grab<00:03:27.670> all<00:03:28.060> of<00:03:28.090> those<00:03:28.329> go<00:03:28.600> to<00:03:28.660> project<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.440> drag

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
grab all of those go to project and drag

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.640 
grab all of those go to project and drag
our<00:03:30.040> VCR<00:03:30.519> into<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.389> and<00:03:31.569> now<00:03:32.260> they're<00:03:32.470> not

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
our VCR into it and now they're not

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:34.710 
our VCR into it and now they're not
being<00:03:32.920> lit<00:03:33.100> so<00:03:33.280> what<00:03:33.459> we<00:03:33.549> could<00:03:33.760> do<00:03:33.940> is<00:03:34.239> set<00:03:34.660> up

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
being lit so what we could do is set up

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.059 
being lit so what we could do is set up
different<00:03:35.170> lights<00:03:35.350> for<00:03:35.530> different<00:03:35.739> objects

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:36.069 
different lights for different objects

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.590 
different lights for different objects
but<00:03:36.190> that's<00:03:36.340> kind<00:03:36.579> of<00:03:36.639> a<00:03:36.730> pain<00:03:36.880> in<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.120> ass<00:03:37.269> and

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
but that's kind of a pain in the ass and

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.240 
but that's kind of a pain in the ass and
it<00:03:37.780> would<00:03:37.900> take<00:03:38.049> a<00:03:38.079> long<00:03:38.350> time<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.889> keep

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
it would take a long time to keep

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.259 
it would take a long time to keep
traveling<00:03:39.459> especially<00:03:39.730> if<00:03:40.090> you<00:03:40.150> have<00:03:40.239> a

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
traveling especially if you have a

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:41.819 
traveling especially if you have a
bigger<00:03:40.450> scene<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:40.900> what<00:03:41.079> I<00:03:41.200> figured<00:03:41.620> out<00:03:41.680> you

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:41.829 
bigger scene so what I figured out you

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:44.039 
bigger scene so what I figured out you
can<00:03:42.100> do<00:03:42.310> is<00:03:42.489> on<00:03:42.730> our<00:03:43.000> texture<00:03:43.540> for<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.039 --> 00:03:44.049 
can do is on our texture for the

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:46.410 
can do is on our texture for the
luminance<00:03:44.560> channel<00:03:44.650> if<00:03:45.370> we<00:03:45.549> use<00:03:45.700> that<00:03:45.940> same

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:46.420 
luminance channel if we use that same

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:51.690 
luminance channel if we use that same
image<00:03:48.569> it's<00:03:49.569> basically<00:03:49.959> going<00:03:50.260> to<00:03:50.380> use<00:03:50.859> that

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
image it's basically going to use that

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.390 
image it's basically going to use that
for<00:03:52.150> as<00:03:52.239> much<00:03:52.420> as<00:03:52.480> I<00:03:52.690> understand<00:03:53.319> to<00:03:53.560> light

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
for as much as I understand to light

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.759 
for as much as I understand to light
itself<00:03:54.790> and<00:03:55.060> bring<00:03:55.299> that<00:03:55.569> back<00:03:55.900> as<00:03:56.079> if<00:03:56.200> it<00:03:56.319> was

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
itself and bring that back as if it was

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.800 
itself and bring that back as if it was
not<00:03:57.280> being<00:03:57.579> lit<00:03:57.849> by<00:03:57.880> images<00:03:58.450> but<00:03:58.599> kind<00:03:58.750> of

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
not being lit by images but kind of

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.300 
not being lit by images but kind of
giving<00:03:58.989> that<00:03:59.139> color<00:03:59.319> so<00:03:59.680> if<00:03:59.859> I<00:03:59.950> do<00:04:00.010> another

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
giving that color so if I do another

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:02.099 
giving that color so if I do another
quick<00:04:00.579> render<00:04:00.849> to<00:04:00.970> kind<00:04:01.120> of<00:04:01.209> a<00:04:01.389> B<00:04:01.690> this<00:04:01.870> and

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:02.109 
quick render to kind of a B this and

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:03.629 
quick render to kind of a B this and
compare<00:04:02.440> where<00:04:02.769> we<00:04:02.889> are<00:04:03.069> to<00:04:03.160> where<00:04:03.220> we<00:04:03.400> were

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:03.639 
compare where we are to where we were

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:06.330 
compare where we are to where we were
this<00:04:04.630> looks<00:04:04.930> accurate<00:04:05.410> it's<00:04:05.799> not<00:04:05.980> being<00:04:06.130> lit

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 
this looks accurate it's not being lit

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.979 
this looks accurate it's not being lit
by<00:04:06.370> our<00:04:06.609> scene<00:04:06.880> but<00:04:07.239> that's<00:04:07.420> what<00:04:07.569> we<00:04:07.660> wanted

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
by our scene but that's what we wanted

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.390 
by our scene but that's what we wanted
and<00:04:08.170> we're<00:04:08.290> still<00:04:08.470> getting<00:04:08.560> our<00:04:08.799> reflections

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
and we're still getting our reflections

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.550 
and we're still getting our reflections
from<00:04:09.760> cinema<00:04:10.120> 4d<00:04:10.359> as<00:04:10.660> compared<00:04:11.019> to<00:04:11.079> this<00:04:11.349> one

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:11.560 
from cinema 4d as compared to this one

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.349 
from cinema 4d as compared to this one
where<00:04:11.769> it's<00:04:12.069> being<00:04:12.370> lit<00:04:12.519> by<00:04:12.549> our<00:04:12.760> seed<00:04:13.000> but<00:04:13.180> it

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:13.359 
where it's being lit by our seed but it

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:14.729 
where it's being lit by our seed but it
might<00:04:13.540> not<00:04:13.569> be<00:04:13.690> what<00:04:13.989> we<00:04:14.109> want<00:04:14.290> this<00:04:14.590> is<00:04:14.709> a

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
might not be what we want this is a

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.409 
might not be what we want this is a
pretty<00:04:14.980> subtle<00:04:15.430> example<00:04:15.880> of<00:04:15.970> this<00:04:16.090> if<00:04:16.269> we're

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 
pretty subtle example of this if we're

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.759 
pretty subtle example of this if we're
just<00:04:16.570> getting<00:04:16.750> this<00:04:16.870> tint<00:04:17.200> but<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.560> have

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
just getting this tint but I have

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.710 
just getting this tint but I have
another<00:04:18.010> copy<00:04:18.280> of<00:04:18.459> the<00:04:18.579> same<00:04:18.789> project<00:04:19.120> over

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
another copy of the same project over

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.350 
another copy of the same project over
here<00:04:20.079> and<00:04:20.260> massively<00:04:21.220> different<00:04:21.700> textures<00:04:22.180> so

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
here and massively different textures so

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.570 
here and massively different textures so
if<00:04:22.450> I<00:04:22.539> do<00:04:22.599> a<00:04:22.690> quick<00:04:22.810> shift<00:04:23.530> are<00:04:23.770> with<00:04:24.039> this<00:04:24.340> and

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
if I do a quick shift are with this and

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.400 
if I do a quick shift are with this and
ignoring<00:04:25.390> that<00:04:25.539> I<00:04:25.570> don't<00:04:25.750> have<00:04:25.840> the<00:04:25.930> settings

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
ignoring that I don't have the settings

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.930 
ignoring that I don't have the settings
so<00:04:26.620> the<00:04:26.710> reflection<00:04:27.010> to<00:04:27.250> look<00:04:27.400> great<00:04:27.730> we<00:04:27.850> can

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
so the reflection to look great we can

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.090 
so the reflection to look great we can
see<00:04:28.120> that<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.630> light<00:04:28.870> coming<00:04:29.290> from<00:04:29.620> this

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
see that the light coming from this

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.760 
see that the light coming from this
setup<00:04:30.610> is<00:04:30.940> a<00:04:31.150> lot<00:04:31.390> of<00:04:31.600> the<00:04:31.780> textures<00:04:32.260> so<00:04:32.530> the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
setup is a lot of the textures so the

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.890 
setup is a lot of the textures so the
reddit<00:04:33.130> here<00:04:33.370> has<00:04:33.550> luminance<00:04:34.030> and<00:04:34.270> reflection

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
reddit here has luminance and reflection

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.540 
reddit here has luminance and reflection
and<00:04:35.050> an<00:04:35.200> environment<00:04:35.860> map<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.250> get<00:04:36.400> some

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
and an environment map to get some

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.070 
and an environment map to get some
colors<00:04:36.850> in<00:04:36.880> there<00:04:37.180> and<00:04:37.390> there's<00:04:37.840> not<00:04:38.020> even

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
colors in there and there's not even

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.200 
colors in there and there's not even
lights<00:04:38.710> in<00:04:38.950> the<00:04:39.100> scene<00:04:39.400> so<00:04:39.760> it's<00:04:39.910> not<00:04:40.030> as

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
lights in the scene so it's not as

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.760 
lights in the scene so it's not as
simple<00:04:40.480> as<00:04:40.630> just<00:04:40.900> kind<00:04:41.020> of<00:04:41.110> ignoring<00:04:41.530> it<00:04:41.740> in

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
simple as just kind of ignoring it in

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.800 
simple as just kind of ignoring it in
this<00:04:41.890> case<00:04:42.070> we<00:04:42.280> might<00:04:42.670> want<00:04:42.970> this<00:04:43.120> black<00:04:43.360> set

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
this case we might want this black set

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.350 
this case we might want this black set
up<00:04:43.960> for<00:04:44.290> these<00:04:44.440> awesome<00:04:45.190> VCR<00:04:45.610> sales<00:04:45.910> but<00:04:46.270> we

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
up for these awesome VCR sales but we

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.670 
up for these awesome VCR sales but we
don't<00:04:46.480> wanna<00:04:46.600> have<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.810> add<00:04:46.930> lights<00:04:47.260> to<00:04:47.470> mess

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
don't wanna have to add lights to mess

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.320 
don't wanna have to add lights to mess
it<00:04:47.830> up<00:04:47.890> to<00:04:48.070> light<00:04:48.250> this<00:04:48.460> so<00:04:48.670> again<00:04:48.940> what<00:04:49.120> I<00:04:49.150> can

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
it up to light this so again what I can

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.910 
it up to light this so again what I can
do<00:04:49.450> is<00:04:49.570> just<00:04:49.720> grab<00:04:49.930> this<00:04:50.200> 2d<00:04:50.590> image

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
do is just grab this 2d image

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.090 
do is just grab this 2d image
double-click<00:04:51.670> it<00:04:51.880> go<00:04:52.660> to<00:04:52.750> luminance<00:04:53.350> grab

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.100 
double-click it go to luminance grab

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.380 
double-click it go to luminance grab
that<00:04:54.310> same<00:04:54.640> image<00:04:56.490> do<00:04:57.490> another<00:04:57.700> quick<00:04:58.000> render

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
that same image do another quick render

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.330 
that same image do another quick render
and<00:04:58.690> we<00:04:59.050> can<00:04:59.170> see<00:04:59.290> it's<00:04:59.470> totally<00:04:59.860> taking<00:05:00.130> care

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
and we can see it's totally taking care

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:01.920 
and we can see it's totally taking care
of<00:05:00.370> our<00:05:00.520> problem<00:05:00.700> it<00:05:00.970> actually<00:05:01.000> looks<00:05:01.600> more

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:01.930 
of our problem it actually looks more

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:03.810 
of our problem it actually looks more
even<00:05:02.350> with<00:05:02.500> the<00:05:02.650> lights<00:05:02.890> on<00:05:03.100> these<00:05:03.430> numbers

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
even with the lights on these numbers

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.640 
even with the lights on these numbers
because<00:05:04.390> they're<00:05:04.510> being<00:05:04.870> caused<00:05:05.170> by<00:05:05.380> all<00:05:05.500> this

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
because they're being caused by all this

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.610 
because they're being caused by all this
luminance<00:05:06.280> and<00:05:06.460> they're<00:05:07.270> being<00:05:07.450> not<00:05:08.050> a<00:05:08.290> really

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:08.620 
luminance and they're being not a really

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.530 
luminance and they're being not a really
easy<00:05:08.800> way<00:05:09.040> to<00:05:09.100> get<00:05:09.550> that<00:05:09.790> other<00:05:09.910> than<00:05:10.180> this<00:05:10.300> so

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
easy way to get that other than this so

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.630 
easy way to get that other than this so
when<00:05:11.020> you're<00:05:11.140> dealing<00:05:11.290> with<00:05:11.440> 2d<00:05:11.800> images<00:05:12.250> in<00:05:12.430> 3d

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
when you're dealing with 2d images in 3d

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.330 
when you're dealing with 2d images in 3d
scenes<00:05:13.090> these<00:05:13.840> couple<00:05:14.260> little<00:05:14.380> tricks<00:05:14.740> are<00:05:14.950> a

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
scenes these couple little tricks are a

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.450 
scenes these couple little tricks are a
really<00:05:15.970> helpful<00:05:16.210> way<00:05:16.450> to<00:05:17.350> get<00:05:17.860> them<00:05:18.040> into<00:05:18.370> your

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
really helpful way to get them into your

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.550 
really helpful way to get them into your
scene<00:05:18.760> get<00:05:19.030> them<00:05:19.180> blended<00:05:19.600> in<00:05:19.750> and<00:05:19.990> to<00:05:20.350> save

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
scene get them blended in and to save

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.410 
scene get them blended in and to save
the<00:05:20.740> time<00:05:20.980> of<00:05:21.010> setting<00:05:21.550> up<00:05:21.640> object<00:05:22.060> buffers

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:22.420 
the time of setting up object buffers

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:23.760 
the time of setting up object buffers
and<00:05:22.630> setting<00:05:22.900> it<00:05:22.990> to<00:05:23.050> After<00:05:23.260> Effects<00:05:23.530> for

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
lighting issues and if you're dealing

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:29.280 
lighting issues and if you're dealing
with<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:28.000> flat<00:05:28.300> 2d<00:05:28.660> images<00:05:28.990> like<00:05:29.080> this<00:05:29.230> one

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:29.290 
with the flat 2d images like this one

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:31.470 
with the flat 2d images like this one
last<00:05:29.830> little<00:05:29.980> bonus<00:05:30.550> thing<00:05:30.790> you<00:05:30.910> could<00:05:31.060> do<00:05:31.270> is

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:31.480 
last little bonus thing you could do is

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.860 
last little bonus thing you could do is
if<00:05:31.990> we<00:05:32.110> look<00:05:32.410> at<00:05:32.740> our<00:05:32.770> scene<00:05:33.420> our<00:05:34.420> camera<00:05:34.810> is

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
if we look at our scene our camera is

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.450 
if we look at our scene our camera is
kind<00:05:34.960> of<00:05:35.140> swinging<00:05:35.440> around<00:05:35.530> in<00:05:35.890> this<00:05:36.010> case<00:05:36.250> and

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
kind of swinging around in this case and

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.550 
kind of swinging around in this case and
it's<00:05:36.550> not<00:05:36.700> too<00:05:36.910> big<00:05:37.060> of<00:05:37.180> a<00:05:37.270> camera<00:05:37.570> move<00:05:37.750> but<00:05:38.050> if

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
it's not too big of a camera move but if

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.080 
it's not too big of a camera move but if
we<00:05:38.800> have<00:05:38.950> the<00:05:39.070> camera<00:05:39.400> moving<00:05:39.610> around<00:05:39.790> a<00:05:39.910> lot

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
we have the camera moving around a lot

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:42.390 
we have the camera moving around a lot
the<00:05:40.480> issue<00:05:40.690> that<00:05:41.050> could<00:05:41.230> come<00:05:41.410> up<00:05:41.440> is<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:42.310> know

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
the issue that could come up is you know

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.190 
the issue that could come up is you know
this<00:05:42.520> is<00:05:42.700> just<00:05:42.970> a<00:05:43.090> thin<00:05:43.360> plane<00:05:43.660> so<00:05:43.960> if<00:05:44.020> we<00:05:44.110> don't

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
this is just a thin plane so if we don't

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.930 
this is just a thin plane so if we don't
see<00:05:44.320> it<00:05:44.590> from<00:05:44.740> the<00:05:44.860> right<00:05:45.040> angle<00:05:45.310> it's<00:05:45.820> gonna

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:45.940 
see it from the right angle it's gonna

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:47.640 
see it from the right angle it's gonna
kind<00:05:46.270> of<00:05:46.300> break<00:05:46.570> the<00:05:46.900> illusion<00:05:47.200> that<00:05:47.410> this

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
kind of break the illusion that this

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:50.070 
kind of break the illusion that this
isn't<00:05:47.890> a<00:05:48.130> real<00:05:48.160> 3d<00:05:48.669> object<00:05:49.120> so<00:05:49.270> what<00:05:49.810> we<00:05:49.900> could

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
isn't a real 3d object so what we could

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.230 
isn't a real 3d object so what we could
do<00:05:50.290> there's<00:05:50.740> a<00:05:50.830> tag<00:05:51.160> to<00:05:51.490> deal<00:05:51.669> with<00:05:51.820> that<00:05:52.000> if<00:05:52.150> we

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.240 
do there's a tag to deal with that if we

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.659 
do there's a tag to deal with that if we
right-click<00:05:52.450> cinema<00:05:52.960> 4d<00:05:53.169> tag<00:05:53.500> look<00:05:53.980> at<00:05:54.160> camera

00:05:54.659 --> 00:05:54.669 
right-click cinema 4d tag look at camera

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.000 
right-click cinema 4d tag look at camera
but<00:05:55.390> by<00:05:55.540> default<00:05:55.720> it's<00:05:56.110> gonna<00:05:56.230> kind<00:05:56.500> of<00:05:56.590> mess

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.010 
but by default it's gonna kind of mess

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:59.610 
but by default it's gonna kind of mess
this<00:05:57.280> up<00:05:57.520> and<00:05:57.760> put<00:05:58.480> the<00:05:58.600> brakes<00:05:58.870> on<00:05:59.020> my<00:05:59.260> cool

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
this up and put the brakes on my cool

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.680 
this up and put the brakes on my cool
tutorial<00:06:00.400> because<00:06:00.550> it's<00:06:00.790> gonna<00:06:00.910> point<00:06:01.450> it<00:06:01.540> at

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
tutorial because it's gonna point it at

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.470 
tutorial because it's gonna point it at
the<00:06:01.780> wrong<00:06:01.960> axis<00:06:02.470> but<00:06:02.830> what<00:06:03.520> we<00:06:03.610> can<00:06:03.760> do<00:06:04.060> is<00:06:04.300> if

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:04.480 
the wrong axis but what we can do is if

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.140 
the wrong axis but what we can do is if
we<00:06:04.630> grab<00:06:05.020> that<00:06:05.050> VCR<00:06:05.590> and<00:06:05.770> put<00:06:06.040> it<00:06:06.130> in<00:06:06.220> a<00:06:06.340> null<00:06:06.640> so

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150 
we grab that VCR and put it in a null so

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.420 
we grab that VCR and put it in a null so
option<00:06:07.570> G<00:06:07.900> to<00:06:08.140> group<00:06:08.380> it<00:06:08.560> and<00:06:08.770> then<00:06:09.070> out<00:06:09.370> of

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
option G to group it and then out of

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.820 
option G to group it and then out of
that<00:06:09.700> null<00:06:10.090> add<00:06:10.419> that<00:06:10.660> look<00:06:10.900> at<00:06:11.080> camera<00:06:11.590> tag

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
that null add that look at camera tag

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.100 
that null add that look at camera tag
and<00:06:12.130> this<00:06:12.970> is<00:06:13.210> still<00:06:13.390> gonna<00:06:13.510> happen<00:06:13.720> but<00:06:14.020> we

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 
and this is still gonna happen but we
