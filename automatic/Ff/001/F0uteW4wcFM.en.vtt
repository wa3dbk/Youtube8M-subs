how positive the steering is here I'm
going<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.560> turn<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.040> wheel<00:01:20.400> about<00:01:20.729> 90<00:01:21.119> degrees

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
going to turn the wheel about 90 degrees

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.520 
going to turn the wheel about 90 degrees
to<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> left<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:23.420> you<00:01:24.420> can<00:01:24.600> see<00:01:25.020> just<00:01:25.409> how

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
to the left and you can see just how

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.730 
to the left and you can see just how
quickly<00:01:25.890> we're<00:01:26.430> changing<00:01:26.939> course<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.740> even

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
quickly we're changing course here even

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.940 
quickly we're changing course here even
though<00:01:29.180> we<00:01:30.180> have<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:31.229> troll<00:01:31.470> plate<00:01:31.740> in<00:01:31.860> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
though we have the troll plate in the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.870 
though we have the troll plate in the
down<00:01:32.159> position

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
down position

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.600 
down position
now<00:01:33.720> you<00:01:33.780> can<00:01:33.990> steepen<00:01:34.409> it<00:01:34.500> up<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.770> little<00:01:34.979> bit

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.930 

and<00:01:37.820> I<00:01:38.180> can<00:01:38.480> roll<00:01:39.020> it<00:01:39.170> back<00:01:39.440> and<00:01:39.890> stop<00:01:40.580> it<00:01:40.820> right

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
and I can roll it back and stop it right

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:45.520 
and I can roll it back and stop it right
on<00:01:41.150> course<00:01:42.400> very<00:01:43.400> positive<00:01:44.060> we<00:01:44.810> can<00:01:44.840> swing<00:01:45.350> it

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
on course very positive we can swing it

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.840 
on course very positive we can swing it
around<00:01:45.650> to<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.460> right<00:01:48.280> you<00:01:49.280> can<00:01:49.430> see<00:01:49.730> it

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
around to the right you can see it

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.359 
around to the right you can see it
moving<00:01:50.090> there

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
moving there

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:57.029 
moving there
so<00:01:52.969> this<00:01:53.240> is<00:01:53.740> this<00:01:54.740> is<00:01:54.920> what<00:01:55.219> you<00:01:55.250> can<00:01:55.460> do<00:01:55.670> with

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
so this is this is what you can do with

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:59.770 
so this is this is what you can do with
control<00:01:58.039> plate<00:01:58.280> in<00:01:58.399> the<00:01:58.520> down<00:01:58.700> position<00:01:59.030> we

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
control plate in the down position we

are<00:01:59.810> we<00:02:00.649> are<00:02:00.770> very<00:02:00.799> very<00:02:01.399> positive<00:02:03.219> extremely

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
are we are very very positive extremely

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:07.929 
are we are very very positive extremely
tight<00:02:04.490> control<00:02:05.380> even<00:02:06.380> though<00:02:06.799> our<00:02:07.280> thrust<00:02:07.759> is

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:07.939 
tight control even though our thrust is

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:09.789 
tight control even though our thrust is

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:09.799 
being dispersed we have the rudder

00:02:09.799 --> 00:02:12.940 
being dispersed we have the rudder
