00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.400
 I find you for a little review 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.000
 so it's in partnership with the brand 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.410
 temis to talk to you fairly regularly 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.059
 I actually received a box from the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.370
 November and I have you even 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.730
 not spoken because I did my break 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.450
 a little youtube on me december and that 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.830
 I had 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.390
 not at all starting to use 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.700
 products I started using them at 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.460
 I would go in early December 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.770
 so here I tested the products of the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.970
 pork to talk about it now 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:31.470
 knowing that on the site of themis you 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.090
 now I do not know if it was 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.470
 like that when I have a doubt you have 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.640
 the delivery offered without minimum 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.220
 so that's great 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.070
 and from 30 euros of purchase you 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.570
 have the hyaluronic acid serum sense 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.910
 that I'm going to introduce you there that is 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.230
 offered and from 60 euros of purchase 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.360
 you have the chocolate mask of which 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.190
 everyone is talking and that awesome who 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.480
 is also offered to you so that's it 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.950
 is still worth to that shot they are in 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.030
 phase of themis I think it's 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.850
 a great brand that is fighting because 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.140
 they send me products all that 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.960
 I tried practically I was 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.080
 happy so that's for the one who 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.240
 had produced a little bio that's it 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.009
 it costs you tested after that can be 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.060
 a bit expensive for some but 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.440
 despite all that is still worth it 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.479
 to talk to you about it then after you 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.210
 do of course wanted so I had 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.910
 received this tears box 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.490
 here is the mark so here is 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:23.340
 inside there was it was in 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.660
 little pigs like that the products 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.890
 were in pouches like that so 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.100
 There are two products inside 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.539
 there's good I kept you the boxes but 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.759
 I will buy it separately 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.630
 so you have neither to be the moisturizer of 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:42.330
 24 rich and you have the acid 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.679
 hyaluronic so are I testing them 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.610
 two I tell you a little bit what they 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.679
 say on the site 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.420
 and then there I tell you that me 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.560
 I thought so hyaluronic acid 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.610
 meaning 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.689
 it costs 18 euros on the site so 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.950
 what do they say about it 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:59.409
 for all skins whatever 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.570
 the age that it is a powerful regenerating 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.009
 cellular that it penetrates smoothly into 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.070
 depth by so he hydrates 

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:09.000
 intensely and that it shows closes a 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.000
 visible firmness in the face 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.110
 tac tac tac I live a little bit this 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.840
 they say 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.880
 it is a retaining up to 1000 times 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.780
 its weight in water and therefore to hydration 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.750
 maximum etc etc 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.830
 at the level of the compo you have to 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:33.250
 Glycerin water deficiency extract 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:35.950
 a messi of veronic ones myelin 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.590
 is full of stuff I do not know it 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.390
 there is potassium benzoate 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.000
 you will read because I do not know 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.739
 great thing and still a little 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.819
 alcohol world benzyl alcohol daa 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.830
 alcohol I do not know so you have 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:49.780
 98% of the total ingredients that are 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.130
 of natural origin with 95% of the total 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.810
 ingredients that are derived from 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.000
 organic farming that's it 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.820
 redo the topo of the thing so I 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.489
 I am served I put myself in the evening 

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.870
 and in the morning I had a little stop 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.769
 my bio it because I think my 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.780
 skin she has to blow a little 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.310
 little so I leave a little organic viola 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.480
 she aside for I do not know 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.730
 maybe three weeks I the 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.690
 would resume after May but here I have 

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:13.880
 never a little pot stopped and 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.650
 and so I put it at the level of the 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.690
 good texture already it's great it's a 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.500
 brake so let's understand it's awesome very 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.110
 very proud of these verbs 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.640
 it's really a gel and that's 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.550
 penetrates quickly enough into the skin 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.960
 I think it penetrates fast enough 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.250
 the cap does not have enough 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.150
 quickly the product finally mine in 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:33.710
 anyway it sticks a little bit me 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.360
 find that it sticks a little bit is 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:36.380
 that my opinion but I think it sticks 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:38.000
 a little bit so it's not great 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.320
 on the other hand, it makes you a great base 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.470
 makeup if you need because 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:44.150
 that suddenly it sticks but see that we 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:46.600
 feel that it was worth the products of 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.090
 makeup to adhere to it actually 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.320
 that's it idrac well skin less at 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.340
 level of firmness I will confess 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.470
 that I saw nothing because I do not have the 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.240
 skin that hangs so I can not tell myself 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.230
 at the level of hydration saïd missed 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.360
 that's fine I quite agree with 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.830
 them for the after a penetration it's 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.110
 true that it can be pretty fast too 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.640
 after powerful regenerating cell I 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.050
 you'll admit I did not see a 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:12.190
 incredible difference on my skin but 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.660
 it's effective, it's a good serum 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.760
 here I am not going I am ecstatic 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.380
 on it I did not see a difference in 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.549
 barges at the same time I think it takes 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.690
 also use it long enough to 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:25.090
 that for it to work but 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.950
 but I'm glad I'm here 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.090
 now right now 

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:29.560
 I use that more because I have 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.430
 really skin problems so he 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:35.950
 I have to fix that but here it is 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.850
 good a good serum here to test 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.900
 maybe on the woods a little bit more 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.810
 mature to see what that gives to 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:43.090
 level of facial firmness actually 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.860
 but what I really like is 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.420
 the moisturizer even four rich 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.770
 who's right here I'm going to go watch 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.530
 on the website how much does it cost and I 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.000
 want to tell him wait until tomorrow of four 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.410
 shots of 24 euros anyway so that 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.380
 still still quite expensive and that based 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.300
 of green tea oil and jojoba so 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.620
 what do they say about moisturizing r4i 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.120
 change in depth for a result 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.410
 long time so it's true that you 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.780
 have hydrated skin every 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.280
 days it's clear and puts in the 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.890
 bears an intense relationship yes a 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:10.030
 protection probably a comfort it's 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:12.070
 true that there is no comfort at all 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.480
 with this cream a unique dullness thanks 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.980
 to this exclusive plant synergy 

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.890
 so it takes by not just against 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:19.150
 all in all I actually got the 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.560
 so rich version is for the skins 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.240
 dry to very dry I have skin 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.070
 extremely dry and sensitive to 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.300
 so let's say that on the games it's me 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.590
 okay enough on the other hand I have the 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.570
 skin earlier thanks to the level of the area 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.780
 t and there to blow it too 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:33.430
 rich for me in the day it's my own 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:33.760
 it brings me too much too much in 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.560
 made 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.169
 and suddenly I have the shining skin 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:41.169
 a lot a lot a lot 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:42.400
 so here I put a flat 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.169
 actually it's for skins 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.430
 dry after dry but it does not fit 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.460
 so much for combination skin and skins 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.460
 fat 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:54.600
 good I think that really needs more 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.100
 that I'm turning to cream I think 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.170
 that there is a book waiting for 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.490
 done and I think me better 

00:05:58.170 --> 00:06:01.350
 that I take this how skin type 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:02.850
 after this one suddenly I use it 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:04.050
 awesome real care of the coup at night because 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:07.310
 it is super super moisturizer 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:09.390
 rich went top at the level of smell 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.010
 there is always a water of a hyper 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:13.800
 particular in themis that I love 

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:15.650
 it does not smell the classic creams it 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:22.830
 do not smell the casserole I do not know what but 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:24.630
 so it's a cream here go sometimes 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.410
 so if you put a serum underneath 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.700
 or something else 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:27.900
 you will see she is not 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:30.300
 necessarily easy to penetrate 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.770
 sometimes but hey it's a question 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.610
 usually a month early I said oh 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:33.900
 there but what is it 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.460
 something called being bad and actually 

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:36.780
 no we have to have something where it goes 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:39.660
 must be allowed to let dry in fact 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.770
 serum is below while pillar 

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:43.110
 like a like I tend to 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.640
 to do but really this cream the go 

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.870
 great if you too have skin 

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.660
 dry very dry you can go there 

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:51.800
 that's it reigning dezingue that are enough 

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:53.750
 nickel at the compo 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.699
 these voices there thémis me I find that 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.050
 it is marc excellent name which one does not 

00:06:55.699 --> 00:06:58.280
 not speak enough I think by 

00:06:57.050 --> 00:07:01.330
 compared to the quality of the products they 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.330
 want what they can do 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:05.270
 now it's up to you to see if you 

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:08.509
