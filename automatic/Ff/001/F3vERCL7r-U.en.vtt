have some kind of ruling here in the
next<00:00:12.750> week<00:00:13.049> or<00:00:13.200> so<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:13.799> possibility

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
next week or so is that possibility

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.050 
next week or so is that possibility
Albert<00:00:15.080> why<00:00:16.080> if<00:00:16.560> we<00:00:16.740> have<00:00:16.920> anything<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:18.000> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
Albert why if we have anything in the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.820 
Albert why if we have anything in the
next<00:00:18.300> week<00:00:18.449> or<00:00:18.600> two<00:00:18.660> would<00:00:18.930> be<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.080> settlement<00:00:19.560> I

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
next week or two would be a settlement I

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.019 
next week or two would be a settlement I
think<00:00:20.070> that's<00:00:20.220> certainly<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.640> way<00:00:20.730> judge

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
think that's certainly the way judge

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.720 
think that's certainly the way judge
Berman<00:00:21.539> wants<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.050> go<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.500> uh<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:23.490> know<00:00:23.519> just

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
Berman wants to go and uh you know just

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.310 
Berman wants to go and uh you know just

people<00:00:25.590> day<00:00:25.859> night<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.340> think<00:00:26.820> there<00:00:26.970> are<00:00:27.000> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
people day night I think there are a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.689 
people day night I think there are a
couple<00:00:27.210> things<00:00:27.510> you<00:00:27.689> can<00:00:27.869> take<00:00:28.109> from<00:00:28.580> from<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
couple things you can take from from the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.820 
couple things you can take from from the
order<00:00:29.939> that<00:00:30.090> he<00:00:30.210> put<00:00:30.420> out<00:00:30.599> late<00:00:30.960> last<00:00:30.990> week<00:00:31.410> I

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
order that he put out late last week I

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.330 
order that he put out late last week I
think<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.309> first<00:00:32.489> thing<00:00:32.700> um<00:00:33.570> yes<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.680> he<00:00:34.770> he

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
think the first thing um yes it he he

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.680 
think the first thing um yes it he he
clearly<00:00:35.670> sees<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.570> be

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
clearly sees this is going to be

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.270 
clearly sees this is going to be
difficult<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.320> him<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.590> rule<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:37.980> from<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
difficult for him to rule on from a

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.160 
difficult for him to rule on from a
legal<00:00:38.430> perspective<00:00:38.670> judges<00:00:39.570> generally<00:00:39.960> don't

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
legal perspective judges generally don't

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.880 
legal perspective judges generally don't
like<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.730> intervene<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:41.879> labor<00:00:42.090> law<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.890> it's

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
like the intervene in labor law and it's

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.410 
like the intervene in labor law and it's
clear<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.460> that<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:44.969> he<00:00:45.090> doesn't<00:00:45.270> want

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
clear that I that that he doesn't want

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.389 
clear that I that that he doesn't want
that<00:00:45.750> any<00:00:46.050> sort<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.410> bad<00:00:46.559> precedent<00:00:47.190> no

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
that any sort of bad precedent no

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.110 
that any sort of bad precedent no
Pandora's<00:00:48.180> box<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:49.340> as<00:00:50.340> far<00:00:50.520> as<00:00:50.640> stepping<00:00:51.030> in

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
Pandora's box here as far as stepping in

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.029 
Pandora's box here as far as stepping in
on<00:00:51.210> arbitration<00:00:51.840> so<00:00:52.320> he'd<00:00:52.500> rather<00:00:52.680> have<00:00:52.800> this

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
on arbitration so he'd rather have this

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.130 
on arbitration so he'd rather have this
settled<00:00:53.309> out<00:00:53.550> of<00:00:53.579> court<00:00:53.699> i<00:00:54.030> think<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.780> said

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
settled out of court i think that said

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.389 
settled out of court i think that said
and<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.410> would<00:00:55.559> prompt<00:00:55.890> him<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.010> rule<00:00:56.280> in

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
and that would prompt him to rule in

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.750 
and that would prompt him to rule in
favor<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.940> NFL<00:00:57.590> that<00:00:58.590> said<00:00:58.800> i<00:00:58.829> think<00:00:59.039> it's

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
favor of the NFL that said i think it's

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.150 
favor of the NFL that said i think it's
it's<00:00:59.969> also<00:01:00.180> clear<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:01.170> know<00:01:01.289> he<00:01:01.890> sees

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
it's also clear that you know he sees

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.740 
it's also clear that you know he sees
the<00:01:02.309> NFL<00:01:02.640> is<00:01:02.760> having<00:01:03.030> over<00:01:03.239> each<00:01:03.420> time<00:01:03.690> a

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
the NFL is having over each time a

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.840 
the NFL is having over each time a
penalty<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:04.979> that's<00:01:05.189> why<00:01:05.430> you'd<00:01:05.580> like<00:01:05.729> to

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
penalty and so that's why you'd like to

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.120 
penalty and so that's why you'd like to
push<00:01:06.060> them<00:01:06.270> towards<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.659> settlement<00:01:07.200> and<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
push them towards the settlement and the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.160 
push them towards the settlement and the
way<00:01:08.520> judges<00:01:08.880> generally<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.630> know<00:01:09.689> handle<00:01:10.020> at

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
way judges generally you know handle at

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.929 
way judges generally you know handle at
is<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.650> they<00:01:10.860> try<00:01:11.130> to<00:01:11.189> lay<00:01:11.400> out<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> worst-case

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
is that they try to lay out a worst-case

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.219 
is that they try to lay out a worst-case
scenario<00:01:12.570> for<00:01:12.900> both<00:01:13.140> sides<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:16.140> know

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
scenario for both sides and you know

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.960 
scenario for both sides and you know
kind<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.650> dangle<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.070> over<00:01:17.369> their<00:01:17.520> heads<00:01:17.729> and

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
kind of dangle that over their heads and

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.609 
kind of dangle that over their heads and
you<00:01:18.150> know<00:01:18.270> they've<00:01:18.689> got<00:01:18.840> two<00:01:19.049> conferences

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
you know they've got two conferences

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.219 
you know they've got two conferences
coming<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:20.009> on<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> 12th<00:01:20.610> in<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.450> 19th<00:01:22.049> for

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
coming up on the 12th in the 19th for

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.580 
coming up on the 12th in the 19th for
the<00:01:22.320> oral<00:01:22.560> arguments<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.250> i<00:01:24.060> certainly<00:01:24.869> seems

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the oral arguments and i certainly seems

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.380 
the oral arguments and i certainly seems
like<00:01:25.680> judge<00:01:26.009> Carmen's<00:01:26.430> intent<00:01:26.880> is<00:01:27.090> to<00:01:27.119> get

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
like judge Carmen's intent is to get

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.510 
like judge Carmen's intent is to get
some<00:01:27.630> sort<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.380> settlement<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.920> motion<00:01:29.310> there

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
some sort of settlement in motion there

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.510 
some sort of settlement in motion there
but<00:01:30.210> how<00:01:30.420> does<00:01:30.479> Tom<00:01:30.990> Brady<00:01:31.290> side<00:01:31.710> negotiate

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
but how does Tom Brady side negotiate

but how does Tom Brady side negotiate
here<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.000> try<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.329> find<00:01:34.610> some<00:01:35.610> kind<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:36.060> safe

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
here and try to find some kind of safe

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.780 
here and try to find some kind of safe
area<00:01:36.869> for<00:01:37.110> both<00:01:37.259> sides<00:01:37.530> or<00:01:37.860> acceptable<00:01:38.369> side

area for both sides or acceptable side

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.219 
area for both sides or acceptable side
here<00:01:39.000> doesn't<00:01:39.299> done<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.630> have<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> come<00:01:40.110> from

here doesn't done this have to come from

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.710 
here doesn't done this have to come from
the<00:01:40.380> NFL<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.950> say<00:01:41.159> right<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:41.970> here's<00:01:42.540> the

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the NFL to say right here here's the

the NFL to say right here here's the
deal<00:01:42.930> tom<00:01:43.250> can<00:01:44.250> Brady<00:01:44.520> said<00:01:44.850> hey<00:01:45.000> I'll<00:01:45.149> take

deal tom can Brady said hey I'll take
two<00:01:45.780> games<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:47.810> think<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.960> I<00:01:49.200> the<00:01:49.530> hardest
