00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
I think that's enough i think if we if

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.970 
I think that's enough i think if we if
we<00:07:27.000> stood<00:07:27.300> here<00:07:27.540> for<00:07:27.900> another<00:07:28.320> hour<00:07:28.440> we<00:07:28.830> could

00:07:28.970 --> 00:07:28.980 
we stood here for another hour we could

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:30.440 
we stood here for another hour we could
probably<00:07:29.070> see<00:07:29.340> the<00:07:29.370> entire<00:07:29.700> population<00:07:30.360> of

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.450 
probably see the entire population of

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:33.340 
probably see the entire population of
this<00:07:30.570> country

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:33.350 

00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:35.710 

like<00:07:33.980> it<00:07:34.160> actually<00:07:34.340> last<00:07:34.910> year<00:07:35.210> they<00:07:35.420> did<00:07:35.570> not

00:07:35.710 --> 00:07:35.720 
like it actually last year they did not

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.820 
like it actually last year they did not
have<00:07:36.080> a<00:07:36.110> guy<00:07:36.500> manning<00:07:37.160> the<00:07:37.370> station<00:07:38.800> but<00:07:39.800> I

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:39.830 
have a guy manning the station but I

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.800 
have a guy manning the station but I

think he's there for crowd control he's
also<00:07:41.930> there<00:07:42.200> because<00:07:42.470> a<00:07:42.890> lot<00:07:43.340> of<00:07:43.370> parents<00:07:43.790> were
