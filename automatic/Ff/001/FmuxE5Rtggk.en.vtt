areas<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.659> ball<00:01:46.170> every<00:01:46.530> right<00:01:46.710> here<00:01:46.829> has<00:01:46.979> ok

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
areas this ball every right here has ok

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.289 
areas this ball every right here has ok
so<00:01:47.369> let's<00:01:48.000> just<00:01:48.149> do<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.540> this<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:50.299> ok

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
so let's just do this this and that ok

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.749 
so let's just do this this and that ok
so<00:01:51.360> as<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.869> can<00:01:51.960> see<00:01:52.200> there's<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.759> abandoned

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
so as you can see there's a abandoned

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.850 
so as you can see there's a abandoned
library<00:01:54.119> another<00:01:54.930> abandoned<00:01:55.350> library<00:01:55.680> it

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
library another abandoned library it

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.969 
library another abandoned library it
chest<00:01:56.340> over<00:01:56.700> there<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> know<00:01:57.630> what<00:01:57.869> what<00:01:58.200> I<00:01:58.530> know

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
chest over there I know what what I know

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.600 
chest over there I know what what I know
what<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.310> has<00:02:00.439> there's<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.680> more<00:02:01.950> open

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
what that has there's like more open

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.590 
what that has there's like more open
areas<00:02:02.880> over<00:02:03.090> there

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
areas over there

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.170 
areas over there
there's<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.369> bed<00:02:05.369> in<00:02:05.400> my<00:02:05.640> ship<00:02:05.909> somewhere

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
there's a bed in my ship somewhere

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.820 
there's a bed in my ship somewhere
around<00:02:06.360> here<00:02:06.540> I<00:02:06.689> can't<00:02:07.170> use<00:02:07.500> if<00:02:07.650> I<00:02:07.740> can<00:02:07.890> find<00:02:08.039> it

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
around here I can't use if I can find it

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.780 
around here I can't use if I can find it
spy<00:02:10.830> some<00:02:11.039> diamonds<00:02:11.430> earlier<00:02:11.670> I<00:02:11.730> think

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
spy some diamonds earlier I think

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
spy some diamonds earlier I think
because<00:02:12.540> there's<00:02:12.780> lava<00:02:12.959> I<00:02:13.290> think<00:02:14.510> I'm<00:02:15.510> pretty

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
because there's lava I think I'm pretty

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.500 
because there's lava I think I'm pretty
sure<00:02:16.080> that's<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.770> data<00:02:17.220> layer<00:02:17.610> to<00:02:17.760> step<00:02:18.000> in<00:02:18.180> my

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
sure that's the data layer to step in my

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.990 
sure that's the data layer to step in my
shaft<00:02:18.780> pretty<00:02:19.470> sure<00:02:19.680> but<00:02:20.340> yeah<00:02:20.459> that's<00:02:20.670> with

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
shaft pretty sure but yeah that's with

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.449 
shaft pretty sure but yeah that's with
that<00:02:21.270> you<00:02:21.780> know<00:02:21.900> the<00:02:22.380> good<00:02:22.890> stuff<00:02:23.100> doesn't<00:02:23.370> end

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
that you know the good stuff doesn't end

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:25.820 
that you know the good stuff doesn't end
right<00:02:23.640> there<00:02:23.670> because<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.690> driver<00:02:25.050> map<00:02:25.470> ah

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
right there because this driver map ah

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.340 
right there because this driver map ah
let's<00:02:26.819> fly<00:02:27.060> all<00:02:28.040> right<00:02:29.040> so<00:02:29.600> so<00:02:30.600> as<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:31.080> can<00:02:31.170> see
