00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 
try to blow him up what happened

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.080 
try to blow him up what happened
not<00:02:32.810> really<00:02:33.170> he<00:02:34.129> actually<00:02:34.430> had<00:02:34.610> a<00:02:34.640> very<00:02:34.730> good

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
not really he actually had a very good

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.030 
not really he actually had a very good
experience<00:02:35.290> going<00:02:36.290> over<00:02:36.650> there<00:02:36.799> and<00:02:36.980> I<00:02:37.010> think

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
experience going over there and I think

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.740 
experience going over there and I think
it<00:02:37.280> was<00:02:37.370> surprising<00:02:37.940> to<00:02:37.970> him<00:02:38.209> to<00:02:38.360> see<00:02:38.540> how

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
it was surprising to him to see how

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.789 
it was surprising to him to see how
hospitable<00:02:39.560> Iranians<00:02:40.069> are<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.470> was<00:02:42.620> good

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
hospitable Iranians are and it was good

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:44.470 
hospitable Iranians are and it was good
for<00:02:42.920> him<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.160> do<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.430> because<00:02:43.670> I<00:02:44.150> think<00:02:44.329> the

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
for him to do that because I think the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.300 
for him to do that because I think the
reason<00:02:44.750> why<00:02:44.870> he<00:02:45.019> did<00:02:45.170> it<00:02:45.200> is<00:02:45.379> he<00:02:45.620> was<00:02:45.739> tired<00:02:46.069> of

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
reason why he did it is he was tired of

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.030 
reason why he did it is he was tired of
all<00:02:46.489> the<00:02:46.610> prejudices<00:02:46.819> that<00:02:47.269> he<00:02:47.510> heard<00:02:48.040> his

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
all the prejudices that he heard his

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.530 
all the prejudices that he heard his
friends<00:02:49.340> and<00:02:49.459> family<00:02:49.579> at<00:02:49.879> home<00:02:50.090> who<00:02:50.239> would<00:02:50.390> ask

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
friends and family at home who would ask

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.630 
friends and family at home who would ask
him<00:02:50.840> what's<00:02:51.650> it<00:02:51.769> like<00:02:51.920> over<00:02:52.099> there<00:02:52.400> is

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
him what's it like over there is

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.759 
him what's it like over there is
everybody<00:02:53.000> taking<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:53.540> ak-47<00:02:54.079> to<00:02:54.620> who

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
everybody taking the ak-47 to who

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.009 
everybody taking the ak-47 to who
practice<00:02:55.340> or<00:02:55.670> do<00:02:55.819> you<00:02:55.940> have<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.209> go<00:02:56.390> take<00:02:56.989> a

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
practice or do you have to go take a

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:58.660 
practice or do you have to go take a
camel<00:02:57.349> to<00:02:57.590> the<00:02:57.739> gym<00:02:57.950> or<00:02:58.160> something<00:02:58.489> like<00:02:58.609> that

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:58.670 
camel to the gym or something like that

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.490 
camel to the gym or something like that
and<00:02:59.000> I<00:02:59.090> think<00:02:59.329> he<00:02:59.450> grew<00:02:59.599> tired<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.109> that<00:03:00.260> and

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
and I think he grew tired of that and

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.930 
and I think he grew tired of that and
and<00:03:01.989> so<00:03:02.989> he<00:03:03.049> wanted<00:03:03.319> to<00:03:03.379> sort<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.709> not<00:03:04.430> only<00:03:04.609> see

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
and so he wanted to sort of not only see

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.330 
and so he wanted to sort of not only see
it<00:03:04.970> for<00:03:05.209> himself<00:03:05.569> but<00:03:05.750> also<00:03:05.930> show<00:03:06.319> it<00:03:06.500> most<00:03:07.190> of

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
it for himself but also show it most of

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.670 
it for himself but also show it most of
all<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:07.579> his<00:03:07.730> own<00:03:07.819> community<00:03:08.329> and<00:03:08.540> so<00:03:08.989> you<00:03:09.590> know
