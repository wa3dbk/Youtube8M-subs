have some trouble dicing them up we're

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.900 
have some trouble dicing them up we're
going<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.720> do<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:23.189> bias<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.850> is

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
going to do this on the bias that is

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.200 
going to do this on the bias that is
diagonally<00:00:24.840> so<00:00:25.529> not<00:00:25.949> only<00:00:26.130> can<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.609> use<00:00:26.880> them

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
diagonally so not only can we use them

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.320 
diagonally so not only can we use them
in<00:00:27.240> various<00:00:28.109> recipes<00:00:28.380> Asian<00:00:29.310> recipes<00:00:29.820> but
