00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:54.330
 watermelon or pin as you are also known 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.330

 people who like to consume your all 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:20.570
 cold and you add ice to them the 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:24.200
 alternative that you have with this is from 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.300
 freeze the watermelon into small pieces and 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.000

 100% natural is a juice that you should 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.720
 consume in the morning fasting in the 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.060
 nights before going to sleep and in the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.580
 the day as many times as you want 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.890
 you can accompany it with your stores or 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.150
 with a table or drink with your 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.430
 foods 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.980
 this type of drink and the drinks that 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.400
 they have antioxidant properties and 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:06.710
 Diuretics should be consumed 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.720
 immediately because the air the oxygen 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:11.120
 the oxidants lose their properties 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.070
