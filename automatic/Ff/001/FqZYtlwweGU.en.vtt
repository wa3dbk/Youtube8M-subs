00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.120
 going differently from everyone 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:03.470
 he called the principles 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.550
 panda animation 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:06.700
 and since 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.119
 let's check first 

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:12.119
 and we will die 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:14.399
 let's say 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.099
 made so that she us just 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:18.589
 moved sounded 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.949
 the main 

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:23.929
 that is, special position settings 

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:26.089
 rotation at sizes 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:27.640
 of our sphere 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.650
 pavlov this state on the first 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.710
 channel 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.090
 we have here in the morning 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.520
 as a decree 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.420
 we must be the first 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.590
 to install the key 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.860
 on the question said smooth shaky 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.870
 position 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.840
 to type a question each time 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.840
 elections he is right here 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.350
 landing frame 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.770
 and our scope will be 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:58.780
 navigate with settings 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.500
 I have 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.630
 the result is that 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.050
 from the first landing cantor 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.150
 all all 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.360
 animation frames lined up 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.100
 automatically 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.990
 Just zhumanbay so to go 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.990
 animation see the result 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.000
 we can reduce the mass time and the ending 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.970
 frames 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.680
 format so 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.980
 the fact that 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.870
 but it turns out 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.140
 further we can 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.140
 add another sphere 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.640
 present 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.200
 and besides the walls 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.200
 centers somewhere tursunov side 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.430
 Astana 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.570
 oh sure the first frame press enamel 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.510
 just landing when our sphere 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.790
 will turn to the game of teams 182 and Petrik 180 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:55.480
 to us the project 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.390
 eventually 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.660
 it turns out that we have 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.490
 the atmosphere is turning tukaya 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.380
 he will last there 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.250
 if we want to 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.189
 this sphere besides turning 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:08.249
 still june 

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:10.619
 moved by some object 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.499
 let's say for this sphere 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:14.000
 us panda security 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
 adjustment of small planets 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:21.009
 our issued scope here after honestly i 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.099
 drag the icon directly into this area 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.829
 nissan fits in a group 

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.269
 this sphere 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.290
 Now other measures and not see the, that this sphere 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.599
 are continuing 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.850
 but movement 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.850
 Well, that is, they consider the same movements 

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:39.579
 while moving it intends itself not 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.579
 personal keys are set 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:45.799
 or let's 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:48.109
 this sphere will then return to 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:49.529
 standing position 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:51.249
 absolutely the same place 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:53.459
 we can set let's say churches 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.209
 frames 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.119
 key officials 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.209
 peak exchanges copy first 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.879
 the key has moved the Caucasus to have it 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:03.969
 do yes military district 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:06.779
 we take dauksys 

00:03:06.779 --> 00:03:08.869
 there is 

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:12.349
 the scope of the action we need to go into the sphere choose 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:16.639
 and there we called 

00:03:16.639 --> 00:03:18.749
 we can here something from the sphere 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:20.699
 that is, it is from this 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.389
 these are the keys to the offices 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.169
 to this area 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:25.969
 we can here about the disclosure settings 

00:03:25.969 --> 00:03:28.319
 each include genes that is for such 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.989
 kind of measure for us 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.700
 to the size and their amount believe in the slots 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.700
 separate become 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.439
 and to the first first key 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.669
 stew yes 

00:03:40.669 --> 00:03:43.779
 and transfer to the question how much in the frame 

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:44.630
 Now 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.020
 increased the length of our nation in the forties 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.799
 years 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:51.819
 what is he doing? 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:54.089
 but success we can still make this 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:55.059
 scope 

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:58.239
 another 180 degrees and came back 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:00.309
 either copy the key or 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:03.519
 rubles release date click m games 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.859
 180 

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.099
 let's amiran 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.099
 that's what we get 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.419
 and we see what our animation is 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.419
 first accelerates 

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:24.210
 in the window in this way a little 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.099
 slow down 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.180
 and then repent again 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.520
 and at the end became inhibited 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.060
 that is, we get this 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.309
 cyclical not machine while doing 

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:34.690
 with brakes of may 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.229
 some sites 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:37.770
 to respond brakes 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.249
 rid may 

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:40.759
 open windows now 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.509
 bit map 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.650
 names with blank anniversary 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.710
 their schedule we see what is permissible 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.809
 this line 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:54.809
 parking us all investors 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.300
 let's say 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.559
 falcon clouds 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:04.559
 our green is no different 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.710
 you work mts it we look right now 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.830
 key is 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.599
 by sphere 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:13.939
 and fungi 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:15.029
 turning 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:17.439
 see what is allowed at the end 

00:05:17.439 --> 00:05:19.270
 slowdown 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.969
 line 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:21.900
 fundamentally 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.900
 to immediately 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:27.279
 inspections 

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:30.279
 but did not get straight 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.169
 without comment without eradicated nasa that 

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:34.800
 has come 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.830
 we just wonder lines pushing 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:40.289
 l key 

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.779
 and choose tick rector 

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:44.090
 we do not see what 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:46.370
 straight line 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.370
 the priest of another sphere made kirsanov 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:53.969
 well, except that in the world the general secretary of elle here 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:58.180
 their game we live 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.180
 from the screen as oiled 

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:05.199
 so how do we get it 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.360
 get 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.360
 slowed down what Kamchatsk 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.889
 from the penalty spot however, thank you all for your attention
