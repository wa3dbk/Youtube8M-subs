00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.150 
lot of good guns the one gun that i
really<00:02:21.030> think<00:02:21.270> needs<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.900> be<00:02:22.050> nerfed<00:02:22.440> is<00:02:22.830> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
really think needs to be nerfed is the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.660 
really think needs to be nerfed is the
type<00:02:23.430> 95<00:02:23.960> because<00:02:24.960> people<00:02:24.990> just<00:02:25.770> honestly<00:02:26.400> if

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
type 95 because people just honestly if

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.070 
type 95 because people just honestly if
its<00:02:27.300> way<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:28.380> opie<00:02:29.010> like<00:02:29.760> people<00:02:30.360> can<00:02:30.570> one<00:02:30.810> bird

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
its way to opie like people can one bird

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.170 
its way to opie like people can one bird
for<00:02:31.380> days<00:02:31.800> with<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.370> shit<00:02:32.670> they<00:02:32.790> can<00:02:32.970> just

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
for days with that shit they can just

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.730 
for days with that shit they can just
sit<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> corner<00:02:33.900> wait<00:02:34.050> till<00:02:34.260> you<00:02:34.380> on<00:02:34.560> by

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
sit in the corner wait till you on by

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:37.070 
sit in the corner wait till you on by
and<00:02:35.070> boom<00:02:35.670> shoot<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.210> in<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.990> you're

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
and boom shoot you in this and you're

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.580 
and boom shoot you in this and you're
done<00:02:37.260> so<00:02:37.920> I<00:02:37.950> think<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.430> thing<00:02:38.880> needs<00:02:39.120> to<00:02:39.360> be

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
done so I think that thing needs to be

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.610 
done so I think that thing needs to be
you<00:02:40.590> know<00:02:40.710> not<00:02:40.890> nerv<00:02:41.280> like<00:02:41.730> extremely<00:02:42.390> but<00:02:43.170> it

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
you know not nerv like extremely but it

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.330 
you know not nerv like extremely but it
needs<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.950> be<00:02:44.130> taken<00:02:44.340> down<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.730> little<00:02:45.000> bit<00:02:45.240> and

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
needs to be taken down a little bit and

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.070 
needs to be taken down a little bit and
like<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.490> said<00:02:47.550> there<00:02:47.880> are<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.060> lot<00:02:48.480> of<00:02:48.510> good<00:02:48.840> guns

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
like I said there are a lot of good guns

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.720 
like I said there are a lot of good guns
so<00:02:49.440> I<00:02:49.770> don't<00:02:50.070> think<00:02:50.220> we're<00:02:50.430> gonna<00:02:50.520> have<00:02:50.670> the

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
so I don't think we're gonna have the

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.550 
so I don't think we're gonna have the
same<00:02:51.000> issue<00:02:51.210> like<00:02:51.540> we<00:02:51.690> had<00:02:51.840> with<00:02:51.870> black<00:02:52.260> ops

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
same issue like we had with black ops

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.040 
same issue like we had with black ops
where<00:02:52.800> you're<00:02:52.920> only<00:02:53.070> going<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.460> see<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:54.050> famas

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050
