Wagner
Beforehand you keep thinking it was wishful

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.150
thinking. Yeah –
it looks better. The parents think it looks

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:13.299
better. But how can
I convince the rest of the world that this

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:16.420
is better.
And so we called outside experts to review

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.680
everything we
had done ‐ blindly – and say ‘Is this

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.680
something real?’

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.199
Narrator
The answer that came back was yes – what

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.390
University of Minnesota researchers John Wagner,
Jakub Tolar and Bruce Blazar had

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.890
discovered was real.
The team had reached a major milestone in

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.450
the quest to
unlock the healing power of stem cells.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.250
Tolar
What we have found is that stem cells contained

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.340
in the bone
marrow can heal skin. And this is more unique

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.949
and more
remarkable that may sound in the first glance

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:50.640
because
traditionally we have used bone marrow to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.090
treat bone
marrow diseases.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.219
Narrator
What makes this discovery so incredible is

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.230
that University of
Minnesota researchers have shown that stem

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.100
cells contained
in bone marrow can travel outside of the marrow

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.640
to access –
and heal – other organs.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.910
Wagner
This is the first case, I believe that we’ve

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.230
actually shown you
can use bone marrow to treat something other

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.340
than bone
marrow – in this case skin.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.880
Narrator
The skin disease that the researchers were

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.630
attempting to
treat is called epidermolysis bullosa, or

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.320
E‐B.
This rare genetic disease causes the skin

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.470
to slough off from
everyday contact like bumping into a piece

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.490
of furniture.
Children with the disease must be wrapped

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.320
in bandages like
burn patients.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.340
Wagner
These kids live this very horrible, painful

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.619
life and die at a
very young age. If they don’t die in their

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.469
fist year of life from infection, they
will die in their 20‐30 from an aggressive

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:44.469
skin cancer.

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:47.860
Narrator
In a clinical trial, seven children with E‐B

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.380
underwent an
experimental stem cell treatment.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.570
Each child received a bone marrow transplant
as a way of

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.140
delivering stem cells capable of homing in
on the injured skin

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.000
and correcting the underlying defect that
causes the disease.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.700
Five of the children have seen dramatic improvement.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.410
Tolar
Their lesions are smaller. If they do have

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.980
new ones they heal
much quicker. They are able to run. They are

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.830
able to do
things they could not do before…

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.670
...One child bought a trampoline. Life‐changing
experience, not just for the patients, but

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.670
for us as well.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.690
Narrator
The results are important for two reasons.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.020
First – it’s a step towards a cure for
E‐B – a horrible disease.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.599
Wagner
The second thing is that it tells us the power

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:35.910
of stem cells.
…The great hope for stem cell therapies

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.620
is to go well beyond
treating the bone marrow. Can we use it as

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.069
a way of
treatment liver disease or heart disease,

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:44.720
or kidney disease or
spinal cord injury or diabetes?

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:50.209
…So this really broadens the use of BM in
the treatment of

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.769
many diseases for which we’ve never even
explored before.

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.870
Narrator
So the work is not done – it’s just beginning.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.930
One good way to think about this discovery
is to compare it

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.590
to the invention of the television. The first
TVs in the 1940’s

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.790
had small, black and white screens with a
jittery picture.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.090
Wagner
And yet you compare that to what it is today

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.610
where you have
HD, large screen, color that is perfect looking

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.909
real life. Very
dramatic difference between 1940 and today.

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:28.920
Well – that HD
screen is the cure but none the less that

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.330
first television was
still nothing less than something miraculous.
