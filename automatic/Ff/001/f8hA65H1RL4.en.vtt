is<00:00:27.119> much<00:00:27.330> older<00:00:27.599> I<00:00:28.050> think<00:00:29.010> it's<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.490> a

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.569 
is much older I think it's one and a
half<00:00:29.580> years<00:00:30.000> old<00:00:30.179> now<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:31.099> samson<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.309> only<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
the samsung but the I think the weight

camera<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:05.430> next<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:05.909> minute<00:01:06.270> much<00:01:06.630> faster

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
camera the next so minute much faster

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.480 
camera the next so minute much faster
than<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:08.479> the<00:01:09.479> samsung<00:01:10.020> but<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.409> samsung<00:01:11.310> has

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
than the the samsung but the samsung has

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.969 
than the the samsung but the samsung has
a<00:01:11.520> way<00:01:11.970> better<00:01:12.000> camera<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.810> 8<00:01:13.020> megapixels<00:01:13.799> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
a way better camera is 8 megapixels and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.100 
a way better camera is 8 megapixels and
it<00:01:14.220> can<00:01:14.369> film<00:01:14.810> up<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.920> can<00:01:17.100> film<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.580> to

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
it can film up to and it can film up to

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:24.260 
it can film up to and it can film up to
1080p<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:21.770> Nexus<00:01:22.770> has<00:01:22.979> 5<00:01:23.310> megapixel<00:01:23.880> camera

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
1080p the Nexus has 5 megapixel camera

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.530 
1080p the Nexus has 5 megapixel camera
and<00:01:24.540> I<00:01:25.170> think<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.680> can<00:01:25.710> fill<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.520> 720p<00:01:27.240> but

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
and I think you can fill up the 720p but

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.569 
and I think you can fill up the 720p but
I'm<00:01:27.630> not<00:01:28.020> totally<00:01:28.320> sure<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.799> might<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:29.159> for<00:01:29.400> 80

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
I'm not totally sure it might be for 80

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.670 
I'm not totally sure it might be for 80
so<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.960> think<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.560> AIT's<00:01:31.740> deal<00:01:33.380> so<00:01:34.380> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
so I think it's AIT's deal so the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.120 
so I think it's AIT's deal so the
samsung<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> way<00:01:35.369> better<00:01:35.520> camera<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:37.130> it's

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
samsung is way better camera but it's

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.600 
samsung is way better camera but it's
wayne<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.270> were<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.829> i'll<00:01:40.829> just<00:01:41.070> open<00:01:41.159> up<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
wayne you were and i'll just open up the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.679 
wayne you were and i'll just open up the
phone<00:01:42.060> books<00:01:43.130> of<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.189> phone<00:01:44.640> open<00:01:45.479> up<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
phone books of the phone open up the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.670 
phone books of the phone open up the
phone<00:01:46.759> the<00:01:47.759> they<00:01:48.420> were<00:01:48.479> bout<00:01:48.750> even<00:01:49.259> I<00:01:49.409> didn't

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
phone the they were bout even I didn't

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.120 
phone the they were bout even I didn't
have<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.920> on<00:01:49.979> the<00:01:50.130> phone<00:01:50.369> so<00:01:50.610> try<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.240> again<00:01:52.130> yes

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
have it on the phone so try it again yes

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.550 
have it on the phone so try it again yes
but<00:01:53.990> yeah<00:01:54.990> they're<00:01:55.229> about<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:55.530> same<00:01:55.829> so

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
but yeah they're about the same so

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.399 
but yeah they're about the same so
I<00:01:57.619> mean<00:01:58.460> they're<00:01:58.790> both<00:01:59.000> Android<00:01:59.420> so<00:01:59.720> i<00:01:59.990> guess

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
I mean they're both Android so i guess

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:02.590 
I mean they're both Android so i guess
you<00:02:00.530> can<00:02:00.619> pretty<00:02:00.829> predict<00:02:01.399> that<00:02:01.549> um<00:02:01.970> I<00:02:02.299> open<00:02:02.540> up

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
you can pretty predict that um I open up

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.899 
you can pretty predict that um I open up
the<00:02:02.659> browser<00:02:03.229> but<00:02:03.619> one<00:02:04.250> really<00:02:04.549> do<00:02:04.700> anything

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
the browser but one really do anything

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.210 
the browser but one really do anything
because<00:02:05.600> this<00:02:06.229> one<00:02:06.380> does<00:02:06.500> have<00:02:06.530> a<00:02:06.710> sim<00:02:06.920> card<00:02:06.950> in

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
because this one does have a sim card in

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:14.440 
because this one does have a sim card in
it<00:02:07.720> so<00:02:08.720> try<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:13.280> about<00:02:13.489> they<00:02:13.700> open<00:02:13.940> it<00:02:14.060> up<00:02:14.209> but

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
it so try the about they open it up but

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.380 
it so try the about they open it up but
even<00:02:14.780> but<00:02:14.959> to<00:02:15.170> go<00:02:15.290> this<00:02:15.410> one<00:02:15.769> load<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:17.030> I
