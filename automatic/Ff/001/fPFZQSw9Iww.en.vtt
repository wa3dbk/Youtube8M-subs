0<00:06:27.599> articulation<00:06:28.599> so<00:06:29.169> she's<00:06:29.380> essentially<00:06:29.710> just

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:29.949 
0 articulation so she's essentially just

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.100 
0 articulation so she's essentially just
a<00:06:30.039> statue<00:06:30.279> but<00:06:31.270> really

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110
