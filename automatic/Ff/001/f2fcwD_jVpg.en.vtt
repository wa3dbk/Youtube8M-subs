time<00:00:34.770> today<00:00:35.040> okay<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.270> a<00:00:36.300> valid<00:00:36.690> claim

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
time today okay this is a valid claim

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.440 
time today okay this is a valid claim
but<00:00:37.649> let's<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:38.100> leave<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.610> elaborate<00:00:39.090> on

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
but let's just leave that elaborate on

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.840 
but let's just leave that elaborate on
later<00:00:39.719> I<00:00:40.050> think<00:00:40.590> we<00:00:40.829> can<00:00:41.010> find<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.430> reason<00:00:41.760> for

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
later I think we can find the reason for

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.700 
later I think we can find the reason for
mangas<00:00:42.149> lack<00:00:42.300> of<00:00:42.450> color<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.899> its<00:00:43.050> origins<00:00:43.530> and

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
more assistants in others but the

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.959 
more assistants in others but the
principle<00:05:58.500> is<00:05:58.590> the<00:05:58.620> same<00:05:58.819> comics<00:05:59.819> have
