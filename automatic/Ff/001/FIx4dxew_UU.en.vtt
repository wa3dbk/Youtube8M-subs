this<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.110> did<00:00:37.290> away<00:00:37.469> with<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.829> ignition

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
this that did away with the ignition

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.190 
this that did away with the ignition
points<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:39.510> I'm<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.660> going<00:00:39.809> to<00:00:39.840> give<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.140> a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
points so I'm just going to give you a

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.900 
points so I'm just going to give you a
quick<00:00:40.500> look<00:00:40.680> at<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:41.010> what<00:00:41.340> I've<00:00:41.430> done<00:00:41.550> on<00:00:41.700> top

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
quick look at it what I've done on top

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.950 
quick look at it what I've done on top
here<00:00:42.210> is<00:00:42.360> I've<00:00:42.600> put<00:00:43.290> some<00:00:43.530> plus<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.960> minus

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
here is I've put some plus and minus

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.510 
here is I've put some plus and minus
indicators<00:00:46.530> here<00:00:46.800> just<00:00:47.129> cut<00:00:47.309> them<00:00:47.430> out<00:00:47.460> of

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
indicators here just cut them out of

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.979 
indicators here just cut them out of
some<00:00:47.700> masking<00:00:48.090> tape<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> video

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
some masking tape just so the video

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.889 
some masking tape just so the video
would<00:00:49.140> show<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.559> and<00:00:50.449> it's<00:00:51.449> only<00:00:51.629> really

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
would show it and it's only really

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.110 
would show it and it's only really
important<00:00:52.860> that<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.100> hook<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.460> up<00:00:53.579> when<00:00:54.030> you

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
important that you hook it up when you

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.209 
important that you hook it up when you
wire<00:00:54.329> it<00:00:54.480> into<00:00:54.629> your<00:00:54.870> actual<00:00:55.170> vehicle<00:00:55.620> as<00:00:55.829> for

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
wire it into your actual vehicle as for

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.560 
wire it into your actual vehicle as for
testing<00:00:56.550> these<00:00:56.670> things<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:57.149> doesn't<00:00:57.300> matter

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
testing these things it doesn't matter

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.360 
testing these things it doesn't matter
which<00:00:57.809> way<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.079> unhook<00:00:58.710> up<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.039> old<00:00:59.160> meter

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
which way you unhook up your old meter

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.330 
which way you unhook up your old meter
the<00:00:59.879> red<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:00.210> black<00:01:00.390> lead<00:01:00.690> set<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.280> okay<00:01:02.280> so

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
the red and black lead set is okay so

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.950 
the red and black lead set is okay so
I'm<00:01:02.520> gonna<00:01:02.670> set<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.030> thing<00:01:03.210> in<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.449> in<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.780> vise

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
I'm gonna set this thing in a in a vise

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.479 
I'm gonna set this thing in a in a vise
err<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.260> steady<00:01:04.530> it<00:01:04.589> out<00:01:04.799> this<00:01:04.949> is<00:01:05.070> basically

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
err to steady it out this is basically

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.670 
err to steady it out this is basically
what<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.820> looks<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.240> that's<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.260> shape<00:01:07.530> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
what it looks like that's the shape of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.320 
what it looks like that's the shape of
the<00:01:07.799> thing<00:01:08.010> probably<00:01:08.490> familiar<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.240> if

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
the thing probably familiar with it if

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.060 
the thing probably familiar with it if
you've<00:01:09.479> worked<00:01:09.600> on<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.960> older<00:01:10.200> cars<00:01:10.439> like<00:01:10.950> I

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
you've worked on the older cars like I

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.450 
you've worked on the older cars like I
said<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.490> till<00:01:11.640> about<00:01:11.780> 1974<00:01:13.250> general<00:01:14.250> ballpark

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
said up till about 1974 general ballpark

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.870 
said up till about 1974 general ballpark
kind<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.119> a<00:01:15.210> year<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:16.310> so<00:01:17.310> here<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.580> go<00:01:17.700> it's

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
kind of a year and so here we go it's

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.899 
kind of a year and so here we go it's
gonna<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.150> a<00:01:18.180> short<00:01:18.479> one<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.049> I<00:01:19.490> try<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.520> orient

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
gonna be a short one so I try to orient

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.749 
gonna be a short one so I try to orient
this<00:01:21.030> right<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:22.040> lock<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.369> vise<00:01:23.549> so

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
this right and lock it in the vise so

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.670 
this right and lock it in the vise so
that<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.000> coil<00:01:24.210> doesn't<00:01:24.570> decide<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.200> take<00:01:25.439> off

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
that the coil doesn't decide to take off

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.130 
that the coil doesn't decide to take off
on<00:01:25.890> this<00:01:26.009> here<00:01:26.600> alright<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.810> there's<00:01:27.960> two

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
on this here alright so there's two

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.410 
on this here alright so there's two
basic<00:01:28.290> readings<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.070> we're<00:01:29.189> after<00:01:29.420> there's

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
basic readings that we're after there's

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.940 
basic readings that we're after there's
gonna<00:01:30.540> be<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.750> low<00:01:30.990> ohms<00:01:31.320> reading<00:01:31.740> between

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
gonna be a low ohms reading between

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.830 
gonna be a low ohms reading between
these<00:01:32.310> two<00:01:32.490> terminals<00:01:32.970> here<00:01:33.119> that's<00:01:33.509> for<00:01:33.750> your

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
these two terminals here that's for your

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.899 
these two terminals here that's for your
primary<00:01:34.049> coil<00:01:34.560> there's<00:01:35.009> actually<00:01:35.369> two<00:01:35.520> coils

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
primary coil there's actually two coils

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.370 
primary coil there's actually two coils
that<00:01:35.970> are<00:01:36.030> contained<00:01:36.479> within<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.869> canister

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
that are contained within this canister

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.859 
that are contained within this canister
here<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:41.820> high<00:01:42.000> side<00:01:42.329> or<00:01:42.630> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
here and on the the the high side or the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.310 
here and on the the the high side or the
secondary<00:01:43.350> side<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:44.009> can<00:01:44.159> go<00:01:44.280> between<00:01:45.320> either

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
secondary side you can go between either

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.319 
secondary side you can go between either
terminal<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.009> primary<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:48.090> used<00:01:48.270> for

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
terminal on the primary that used for

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:49.760

you've<00:02:29.180> got<00:02:29.360> a<00:02:29.390> adjustment<00:02:30.290> on<00:02:30.500> it<00:02:30.530> this<00:02:30.680> one

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:30.830 
you've got a adjustment on it this one

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.590 
you've got a adjustment on it this one
this<00:02:31.400> particular<00:02:31.580> one<00:02:31.910> does<00:02:32.150> not<00:02:32.270> have<00:02:32.480> an

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:32.600 
this particular one does not have an

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.240 
this particular one does not have an
adjustment<00:02:32.930> so<00:02:33.230> I'll<00:02:33.800> have<00:02:33.890> to<00:02:33.950> do<00:02:34.070> some

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
adjustment so I'll have to do some

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.080 
adjustment so I'll have to do some
simple<00:02:34.610> mathematics<00:02:35.410> okay<00:02:36.410> I<00:02:36.980> did<00:02:37.700> check<00:02:37.940> this

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
simple mathematics okay I did check this

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.580 
simple mathematics okay I did check this
without<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:38.510> wires<00:02:38.720> and<00:02:39.110> it's<00:02:39.260> the<00:02:39.380> meter

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
without the wires and it's the meter

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.890 
without the wires and it's the meter
that's<00:02:39.890> actually<00:02:40.400> out<00:02:40.550> okay<00:02:41.360> if<00:02:41.690> you<00:02:41.810> have

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
that's actually out okay if you have

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.930 
that's actually out okay if you have
long<00:02:42.140> thin<00:02:42.440> wires<00:02:42.680> that<00:02:43.010> can<00:02:43.220> lead<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.670> more

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940 
long thin wires that can lead to more

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.880 
long thin wires that can lead to more
resistance<00:02:44.420> okay<00:02:45.080> so<00:02:45.140> we<00:02:45.320> calibrate<00:02:45.770> the

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
resistance okay so we calibrate the

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.460 
resistance okay so we calibrate the
meters<00:02:46.160> we're<00:02:46.280> gonna<00:02:46.370> have<00:02:46.550> to<00:02:46.670> subtract<00:02:47.470> 0.3

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:48.470 
meters we're gonna have to subtract 0.3

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:50.530 
meters we're gonna have to subtract 0.3
of<00:02:48.590> an<00:02:48.710> ohm<00:02:48.860> from<00:02:49.790> the<00:02:49.940> reading<00:02:50.180> we're<00:02:50.300> getting

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
of an ohm from the reading we're getting

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.330 
of an ohm from the reading we're getting
yet<00:02:50.690> just<00:02:50.840> on<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.110> low<00:02:51.260> side<00:02:51.530> like<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.130> say<00:02:52.310> on

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
yet just on the low side like I say on

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.800 
yet just on the low side like I say on
the<00:02:52.520> secondary<00:02:53.030> or<00:02:53.120> high<00:02:53.270> side<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:53.660> don't

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
the secondary or high side you don't

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.020 
the secondary or high side you don't
have<00:02:53.840> to<00:02:54.020> worry<00:02:54.170> about<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:54.650> small<00:02:55.190> small

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
have to worry about that small small

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.870 
have to worry about that small small
amount<00:02:56.330> of<00:02:56.650> differential<00:02:57.650> there<00:02:57.800> so<00:02:58.550> we'll<00:02:58.760> go

00:02:58.870 --> 00:02:58.880 
amount of differential there so we'll go

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:01.240 
amount of differential there so we'll go
ahead<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.270> subtract<00:02:59.720> 0.3<00:03:00.620> from<00:03:00.860> our<00:03:00.980> reading

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
ahead and subtract 0.3 from our reading

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.370 
ahead and subtract 0.3 from our reading
that<00:03:01.370> we<00:03:01.460> get<00:03:01.640> here<00:03:01.880> so<00:03:02.390> make<00:03:02.960> sure<00:03:02.990> there's<00:03:03.290> no

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
that we get here so make sure there's no

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:04.960 
that we get here so make sure there's no
oil<00:03:03.410> on<00:03:03.800> your<00:03:03.980> terminals<00:03:04.460> and<00:03:04.580> also<00:03:04.760> when<00:03:04.880> you

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
oil on your terminals and also when you

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:06.700 
oil on your terminals and also when you
test<00:03:05.210> these<00:03:05.390> things<00:03:05.660> don't<00:03:06.230> have<00:03:06.440> any<00:03:06.590> other

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:06.710 
test these things don't have any other

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:08.230 
test these things don't have any other
wires<00:03:06.980> hooked<00:03:07.250> up<00:03:07.490> pretty<00:03:07.820> much<00:03:08.000> have<00:03:08.210> it

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
wires hooked up pretty much have it

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.730 
wires hooked up pretty much have it
looking<00:03:08.630> like<00:03:08.660> you<00:03:08.870> have<00:03:08.900> here<00:03:09.260> with<00:03:09.380> no<00:03:09.530> wires

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:09.740 
looking like you have here with no wires

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.250 
looking like you have here with no wires
on<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.070> primary<00:03:10.310> side<00:03:10.640> or<00:03:10.990> anything<00:03:11.990> on<00:03:12.140> the

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
on the primary side or anything on the

on the primary side or anything on the
secondary<00:03:12.830> tower<00:03:13.510> so<00:03:14.510> now<00:03:14.630> we<00:03:14.750> on<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.380> primary

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
secondary tower so now we on the primary

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.520 
secondary tower so now we on the primary
side<00:03:15.890> we're<00:03:16.130> showing<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.460> reading<00:03:16.760> of<00:03:17.020> 1.8<00:03:18.020> ohms

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
side we're showing a reading of 1.8 ohms

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.980 
side we're showing a reading of 1.8 ohms
now<00:03:18.740> remember<00:03:19.100> we<00:03:19.190> have<00:03:19.220> to<00:03:19.490> subtract<00:03:19.990> decimal

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:20.990 
now remember we have to subtract decimal

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.370 
now remember we have to subtract decimal
3<00:03:21.200> ohms<00:03:21.910> because<00:03:22.910> of<00:03:23.030> that<00:03:23.150> this<00:03:23.720> calibration

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
3 ohms because of that this calibration

a little teeth things there grab on so

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:27.070 
a little teeth things there grab on so
you've<00:04:26.690> got<00:04:26.870> your

you've got your
and<00:04:27.199> free<00:04:27.470> and<00:04:28.870> we'll<00:04:29.870> just<00:04:30.050> probe<00:04:30.289> the<00:04:30.470> inside

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.740 
and free and we'll just probe the inside
adapt<00:04:31.099> and<00:04:31.340> remember<00:04:32.150> we're<00:04:32.300> gonna<00:04:32.360> be<00:04:32.629> going

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
adapt and remember we're gonna be going

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.820 
adapt and remember we're gonna be going
up<00:04:32.960> into<00:04:33.229> oh<00:04:33.439> this<00:04:34.039> one<00:04:34.400> calls<00:04:35.830> anywhere

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
up into oh this one calls anywhere

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:41.230 
up into oh this one calls anywhere
between<00:04:38.349> 8,000<00:04:39.349> to<00:04:39.409> 12,000<00:04:40.159> ohms<00:04:40.340> okay<00:04:40.729> so

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
between 8,000 to 12,000 ohms okay so

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.730 
between 8,000 to 12,000 ohms okay so
we're<00:04:41.449> gonna<00:04:41.539> have<00:04:41.689> to<00:04:41.750> bump<00:04:42.020> this<00:04:42.229> thing<00:04:42.439> up<00:04:42.560> a

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:42.740 
we're gonna have to bump this thing up a

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.619 
we're gonna have to bump this thing up a
couple<00:04:43.099> of<00:04:43.280> ranges<00:04:43.699> that<00:04:43.969> other<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.389> first

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:44.629 
couple of ranges that other the first

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:46.480 
couple of ranges that other the first
range<00:04:44.900> on<00:04:45.050> the<00:04:45.139> primary<00:04:45.500> only<00:04:45.650> went<00:04:45.860> up<00:04:45.889> to<00:04:46.039> 200

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
range on the primary only went up to 200

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.879 
range on the primary only went up to 200
ohms<00:04:46.689> so<00:04:47.689> we<00:04:47.780> need<00:04:47.930> to<00:04:48.050> get<00:04:48.379> something<00:04:48.770> that

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
ohms so we need to get something that

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.059 
ohms so we need to get something that
goes<00:04:49.039> up<00:04:49.280> to<00:04:49.389> approximately<00:04:50.389> 20<00:04:51.139> K<00:04:51.289> or<00:04:51.439> 20,000

00:04:52.059 --> 00:04:52.069 
goes up to approximately 20 K or 20,000

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:54.279 
goes up to approximately 20 K or 20,000
ohms<00:04:52.159> so<00:04:53.150> we'll<00:04:53.270> scratch<00:04:53.509> this<00:04:53.780> in<00:04:53.960> here<00:04:54.169> and

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
ohms so we'll scratch this in here and

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.100 
ohms so we'll scratch this in here and
see<00:04:54.409> if<00:04:54.439> we<00:04:54.530> get<00:04:54.680> our<00:04:54.800> reading<00:04:55.099> okay<00:04:56.080> got<00:04:57.080> to

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:57.110 
see if we get our reading okay got to

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:58.330 
see if we get our reading okay got to
make<00:04:57.289> sure<00:04:57.439> that<00:04:57.590> you<00:04:57.710> really<00:04:57.860> grind<00:04:58.189> these

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
make sure that you really grind these

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.640 
make sure that you really grind these
things<00:04:58.550> in<00:04:58.729> there<00:04:58.909> because<00:04:59.000> if<00:04:59.330> you<00:04:59.449> don't

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
things in there because if you don't

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.899 
things in there because if you don't
have<00:05:00.650> a<00:05:00.740> good<00:05:00.919> connection<00:05:01.219> like<00:05:01.490> you're<00:05:01.699> going

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
have a good connection like you're going

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.320 
have a good connection like you're going
through<00:05:01.969> oxidized<00:05:03.219> metal<00:05:04.219> it'll<00:05:04.969> give<00:05:05.180> you<00:05:05.270> a

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
through oxidized metal it'll give you a

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:06.730 
through oxidized metal it'll give you a
false<00:05:05.569> reading<00:05:05.840> so<00:05:06.080> always<00:05:06.199> make<00:05:06.440> sure<00:05:06.469> you're

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
false reading so always make sure you're

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:08.320 
false reading so always make sure you're
grinding<00:05:07.099> your<00:05:07.250> connections<00:05:07.759> and<00:05:07.909> there's<00:05:08.210> no

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
grinding your connections and there's no

you're<00:05:10.009> gonna<00:05:10.069> get<00:05:10.219> a<00:05:10.280> false<00:05:10.550> reading<00:05:10.789> make

00:05:11.559 --> 00:05:11.569 
you're gonna get a false reading make

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:13.360 
you're gonna get a false reading make
sure<00:05:11.690> that<00:05:11.870> the<00:05:11.990> numbers<00:05:12.289> are<00:05:12.530> steady<00:05:13.039> and<00:05:13.159> not

sure that the numbers are steady and not
jumping<00:05:13.729> all<00:05:13.879> over<00:05:13.909> the<00:05:14.150> place<00:05:14.620> so<00:05:15.620> we<00:05:15.650> got<00:05:15.830> ten

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:16.550 
jumping all over the place so we got ten

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:18.070 
jumping all over the place so we got ten
point<00:05:16.789> three<00:05:17.030> five<00:05:17.270> and<00:05:17.330> on<00:05:17.690> the<00:05:17.810> twenty

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
point three five and on the twenty

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.379 
point three five and on the twenty
twenty<00:05:18.500> K<00:05:18.650> range<00:05:18.919> or<00:05:19.099> twenty<00:05:19.310> thousand<00:05:19.759> ohms

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
twenty K range or twenty thousand ohms

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.339 
twenty K range or twenty thousand ohms
range<00:05:21.099> that's<00:05:22.099> on<00:05:22.250> the<00:05:22.400> meter<00:05:23.349> that's

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:24.349 
range that's on the meter that's

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.409 
range that's on the meter that's
basically<00:05:24.800> ten<00:05:25.159> thousand<00:05:25.639> ohms<00:05:25.819> and<00:05:26.240> three

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
basically ten thousand ohms and three

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.969 
basically ten thousand ohms and three
hundred<00:05:26.509> and<00:05:26.689> fifty<00:05:27.080> or<00:05:27.199> ten<00:05:27.409> thousand<00:05:27.830> three

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:27.979 
hundred and fifty or ten thousand three

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:30.730 
hundred and fifty or ten thousand three
hundred<00:05:28.099> and<00:05:28.310> fifty<00:05:28.639> ohms<00:05:28.849> so<00:05:29.599> that<00:05:30.379> falls

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:30.740 
hundred and fifty ohms so that falls

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.369 
hundred and fifty ohms so that falls
well<00:05:31.069> between<00:05:31.250> the<00:05:31.580> 8,000<00:05:32.360> to<00:05:32.599> 12,000<00:05:33.289> homes

00:05:33.369 --> 00:05:33.379 
well between the 8,000 to 12,000 homes

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:35.379 
well between the 8,000 to 12,000 homes
that<00:05:33.620> I<00:05:33.680> was<00:05:33.770> telling<00:05:33.889> you<00:05:34.069> about<00:05:34.270> so<00:05:35.270> the

00:05:35.379 --> 00:05:35.389 
that I was telling you about so the

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.619 
that I was telling you about so the
secondary<00:05:35.930> side<00:05:36.830> checks<00:05:37.190> out<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:37.909> just

00:05:38.619 --> 00:05:38.629 
secondary side checks out and just

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:40.059 
secondary side checks out and just
quickly<00:05:38.779> I<00:05:38.960> can<00:05:39.199> show<00:05:39.379> you<00:05:39.440> that<00:05:39.529> it<00:05:39.770> does<00:05:39.919> the

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:40.069 
quickly I can show you that it does the

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:42.189 
quickly I can show you that it does the
same<00:05:40.250> thing<00:05:40.580> also<00:05:41.029> with<00:05:41.330> the<00:05:41.449> other<00:05:41.599> polarity

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
same thing also with the other polarity

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.769 
same thing also with the other polarity
here<00:05:42.759> they're<00:05:43.759> interconnected<00:05:43.969> inside<00:05:44.629> the

00:05:44.769 --> 00:05:44.779 
here they're interconnected inside the

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:48.040 
here they're interconnected inside the
coil<00:05:45.339> and<00:05:46.339> they<00:05:46.460> share<00:05:46.699> a<00:05:46.729> common<00:05:47.050> connection

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
coil and they share a common connection

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:49.629 
coil and they share a common connection
point<00:05:48.319> I<00:05:48.469> would<00:05:48.589> assume<00:05:48.830> I've<00:05:49.069> never<00:05:49.250> opened

00:05:49.629 --> 00:05:49.639 
point I would assume I've never opened

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.010 
point I would assume I've never opened
one<00:05:49.849> of<00:05:49.969> these<00:05:50.089> things<00:05:50.240> up<00:05:50.419> so<00:05:50.539> I<00:05:50.569> can't<00:05:50.839> really

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
one of these things up so I can't really

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.469 
one of these things up so I can't really
guarantee<00:05:51.469> that<00:05:51.979> but<00:05:52.370> you<00:05:52.789> can<00:05:52.909> see<00:05:53.089> there<00:05:53.330> are

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
guarantee that but you can see there are

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.869 
guarantee that but you can see there are
the<00:05:53.599> young<00:05:53.839> the<00:05:54.770> readout<00:05:55.069> is<00:05:55.219> pretty<00:05:55.460> much<00:05:55.610> the

00:05:55.869 --> 00:05:55.879 
the young the readout is pretty much the

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:58.930 
the young the readout is pretty much the
same<00:05:56.060> and<00:05:56.990> just<00:05:57.050> quickly<00:05:57.979> I'll<00:05:58.279> just<00:05:58.460> reattach

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
same and just quickly I'll just reattach

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:03.189 
same and just quickly I'll just reattach
this<00:05:59.270> some<00:06:01.389> sala<00:06:02.389> gator<00:06:02.659> clip<00:06:02.930> and<00:06:03.139> we'll

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:03.199 
this some sala gator clip and we'll

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:05.829 
this some sala gator clip and we'll
reverse<00:06:03.680> polarity<00:06:04.039> on<00:06:04.279> here<00:06:04.759> and<00:06:05.089> take<00:06:05.719> her

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:05.839 
reverse polarity on here and take her

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:08.860 
reverse polarity on here and take her
down<00:06:05.870> to<00:06:06.229> the<00:06:06.259> 200<00:06:06.770> ohms<00:06:06.919> again<00:06:07.569> and<00:06:08.569> we<00:06:08.690> should

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
down to the 200 ohms again and we should

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.519 
down to the 200 ohms again and we should
get<00:06:09.080> that<00:06:09.319> same<00:06:09.949> 1.8<00:06:10.669> no<00:06:11.659> it's<00:06:11.810> my<00:06:11.930> sometimes

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:12.529 
get that same 1.8 no it's my sometimes

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:13.510 
get that same 1.8 no it's my sometimes
it<00:06:12.680> moves<00:06:12.830> a<00:06:12.889> little<00:06:12.949> bit<00:06:13.219> I<00:06:13.279> don't<00:06:13.370> know

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
it moves a little bit I don't know

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.119 
it moves a little bit I don't know
whether<00:06:13.789> the<00:06:14.000> the<00:06:14.960> meter<00:06:15.199> or<00:06:15.560> something<00:06:15.800> to<00:06:16.009> do

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:16.129 
whether the the meter or something to do

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:19.329 
whether the the meter or something to do
with<00:06:17.529> whatever<00:06:18.529> is<00:06:18.740> going<00:06:18.889> on<00:06:19.039> but<00:06:19.190> it's

00:06:19.329 --> 00:06:19.339 
with whatever is going on but it's

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:20.920 
with whatever is going on but it's
usually<00:06:19.460> pretty<00:06:19.759> close<00:06:20.120> so<00:06:20.389> you<00:06:20.569> grind<00:06:20.719> them

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:20.930 
usually pretty close so you grind them

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:22.360 
usually pretty close so you grind them
in<00:06:21.020> there<00:06:21.169> make<00:06:21.319> sure<00:06:21.349> last<00:06:21.949> time<00:06:22.129> I<00:06:22.159> showed

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
in there make sure last time I showed

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:24.610 
in there make sure last time I showed
1.8<00:06:23.029> so<00:06:23.210> in<00:06:23.330> 1.9<00:06:23.839> there<00:06:24.139> it's<00:06:24.259> going<00:06:24.440> back<00:06:24.589> to

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
1.8 so in 1.9 there it's going back to

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:27.640 
1.8 so in 1.9 there it's going back to
the<00:06:24.800> 1.8<00:06:25.310> now<00:06:25.580> so<00:06:26.389> minus<00:06:26.690> that<00:06:26.810> point<00:06:27.110> 3<00:06:27.379> on<00:06:27.529> the

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:27.650 
the 1.8 now so minus that point 3 on the

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:29.829 
the 1.8 now so minus that point 3 on the
low<00:06:27.800> side<00:06:28.069> only<00:06:28.310> see<00:06:29.210> it's<00:06:29.300> dancing<00:06:29.690> between

00:06:29.829 --> 00:06:29.839 
low side only see it's dancing between

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:32.200 
low side only see it's dancing between
the<00:06:30.110> two<00:06:30.229> it<00:06:30.349> can't<00:06:30.560> make<00:06:30.740> its<00:06:30.889> mind<00:06:31.129> up<00:06:31.339> we're

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:32.210 
the two it can't make its mind up we're

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.760 
the two it can't make its mind up we're
still<00:06:32.389> at<00:06:32.509> one<00:06:32.629> point<00:06:32.810> 5<00:06:33.110> ohms<00:06:33.139> on<00:06:33.529> the<00:06:33.620> low

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
still at one point 5 ohms on the low

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.579 
still at one point 5 ohms on the low
side<00:06:34.009> yeah<00:06:34.819> like<00:06:35.000> us<00:06:35.149> mentioning<00:06:35.539> before<00:06:35.630> 1.4

00:06:36.579 --> 00:06:36.589 
side yeah like us mentioning before 1.4

00:06:36.589 --> 00:06:39.159 
side yeah like us mentioning before 1.4
to<00:06:36.740> 1.8<00:06:37.279> ohms<00:06:37.490> is<00:06:37.729> good<00:06:37.940> for<00:06:38.180> the<00:06:38.300> primary<00:06:38.899> side

00:06:39.159 --> 00:06:39.169 
to 1.8 ohms is good for the primary side

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:40.070 
to 1.8 ohms is good for the primary side
where<00:06:39.529> these<00:06:39.649> two

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:40.080 
where these two

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.909 
where these two
here<00:06:40.789> okay<00:06:41.789> so<00:06:41.849> and<00:06:42.270> enclosing<00:06:43.110> now<00:06:43.680> that<00:06:43.830> I've

shown you how to show test rather the
the<00:06:46.710> two<00:06:47.310> different<00:06:47.639> circuits<00:06:47.819> and<00:06:48.180> here's

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:48.330 
the two different circuits and here's

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.029 
the two different circuits and here's
two<00:06:48.539> separate<00:06:48.870> coils<00:06:49.259> and<00:06:49.469> they<00:06:49.620> do<00:06:49.740> share<00:06:50.009> a

00:06:50.029 --> 00:06:50.039 
two separate coils and they do share a

00:06:50.039 --> 00:06:52.459 
two separate coils and they do share a

same connection point near somewhere I'm

00:06:52.469 --> 00:06:55.760 
same connection point near somewhere I'm
sure<00:06:53.659> just<00:06:54.659> in<00:06:54.810> closing<00:06:55.169> I'll<00:06:55.289> mention<00:06:55.500> a<00:06:55.650> few

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:55.770 
sure just in closing I'll mention a few

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.260 
sure just in closing I'll mention a few
things<00:06:56.009> this<00:06:56.129> particular<00:06:56.610> one<00:06:56.759> was<00:06:56.879> taken<00:06:57.210> out

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:57.270 
things this particular one was taken out

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.149 
things this particular one was taken out
of<00:06:57.300> service<00:06:57.569> because<00:06:58.080> this<00:06:58.289> was<00:06:58.439> a<00:06:58.469> horizontal

00:06:59.149 --> 00:06:59.159 
of service because this was a horizontal

this<00:07:07.219> coil<00:07:08.219> leaking<00:07:09.120> out<00:07:09.240> of<00:07:09.270> there<00:07:09.569> and<00:07:09.750> I

00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 
this coil leaking out of there and I

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.749 
this coil leaking out of there and I
didn't<00:07:10.530> know<00:07:10.620> how<00:07:10.740> much<00:07:10.889> leaked<00:07:11.159> out<00:07:11.400> probably

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 
didn't know how much leaked out probably

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:13.369 
didn't know how much leaked out probably
not<00:07:11.849> much<00:07:12.030> but<00:07:12.330> I<00:07:12.389> took<00:07:12.659> it<00:07:12.780> out<00:07:12.840> of<00:07:12.960> service<00:07:13.110> to

00:07:13.369 --> 00:07:13.379 
not much but I took it out of service to

00:07:13.379 --> 00:07:15.100 
not much but I took it out of service to
make<00:07:13.500> sure<00:07:13.620> it<00:07:13.710> wasn't<00:07:13.860> gonna<00:07:14.069> overheat<00:07:14.370> and

make sure it wasn't gonna overheat and

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.930 
make sure it wasn't gonna overheat and
