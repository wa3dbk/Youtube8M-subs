00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.910 

I'll<00:01:17.750> Drive<00:01:17.960> drive<00:01:18.320> feels<00:01:18.560> very<00:01:18.800> nice

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:18.920 
I'll Drive drive feels very nice

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.550 
I'll Drive drive feels very nice
actually<00:01:19.160> it's<00:01:19.460> not<00:01:20.020> rattling<00:01:21.020> squeaking

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:21.560 
actually it's not rattling squeaking

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.730 
actually it's not rattling squeaking
banging<00:01:22.520> crashing<00:01:23.420> nothing<00:01:23.690> at<00:01:23.810> all<00:01:23.990> it's

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
banging crashing nothing at all it's

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.010 
banging crashing nothing at all it's
getting<00:01:25.010> on<00:01:25.100> with<00:01:25.250> it<00:01:25.510> hear<00:01:26.510> a<00:01:26.540> slight<00:01:26.720> rattle

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
getting on with it hear a slight rattle

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:34.260 
getting on with it hear a slight rattle
for<00:01:27.260> the<00:01:27.320> back<00:01:27.470> I<00:01:27.500> think<00:01:27.800> that's<00:01:27.950> the<00:01:28.340> tailgate

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:44.890 

there<00:01:35.270> we<00:01:35.570> go

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:44.900 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.420 

so<00:01:45.380> really<00:01:45.560> if<00:01:45.710> you<00:01:45.770> don't<00:01:45.800> mind<00:01:46.070> annoy<00:01:46.250> your

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
so really if you don't mind annoy your

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.860 
so really if you don't mind annoy your
neighbors<00:01:46.760> with<00:01:46.940> the<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.360> swagman<00:01:47.750> the

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
neighbors with the the swagman the

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.800 
neighbors with the the swagman the
diesel<00:01:48.200> ones<00:01:48.350> produce<00:01:49.510> this<00:01:50.510> any<00:01:50.720> more

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
diesel ones produce this any more

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.620 
diesel ones produce this any more
economical<00:01:51.380> the<00:01:51.530> petrol<00:01:51.890> model

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.340 

it's<00:01:57.140> not<00:01:57.259> quite<00:01:57.469> like<00:01:57.590> a<00:01:57.649> bottle<00:01:57.950> diesel<00:01:59.350> go

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
it's not quite like a bottle diesel go

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:13.050 
it's not quite like a bottle diesel go
