00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.640

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
maybe when I place the little balls in

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.620 
maybe when I place the little balls in
the<00:02:32.710> indents<00:02:33.100> that<00:02:33.340> were<00:02:33.460> made<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.150> you<00:02:34.450> want

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:34.630 
the indents that were made and you want

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.030 
the indents that were made and you want
to<00:02:34.720> put<00:02:34.870> them<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.080> groups<00:02:35.350> so<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:35.740> looks<00:02:35.890> like

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
to put them in groups so it looks like

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:48.679 
to put them in groups so it looks like
you<00:02:36.190> cut<00:02:36.490> it<00:02:36.580> an<00:02:36.670> actual<00:02:36.820> pomegranate<00:02:37.570> in<00:02:37.690> half

at this point you want to insert the

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.239 
at this point you want to insert the
headpin<00:02:51.879> if<00:02:52.120> you<00:02:52.959> are<00:02:53.109> using<00:02:53.290> an<00:02:53.530> eyepin<00:02:53.920> go

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:54.249 
headpin if you are using an eyepin go

00:02:54.249 --> 00:03:08.910 
headpin if you are using an eyepin go
ahead<00:02:54.489> and<00:02:54.639> wait<00:02:54.790> to<00:02:54.999> the<00:02:55.150> very<00:02:55.299> end
