00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.910
 songs and videos we have of course 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.190
 fully later it had happened it is 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:13.019
 The issue I think is quite cool 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.150
 you see and I'm just full 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.330
 on the mel's new show 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.699
 yes a small excerpt one 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.070
 the dream job almost every little one 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.210
 boy has is astronaut with me that was 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.400
 not necessarily the case, however 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.710
 I would not be no by now 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.330
 say if you would make the offer 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.850
 you pull this one of the hammer this too 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.350
 already at ross in there I was totally and 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.920
 now tremeloes the moral again 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.340
 boredom 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.989
 Let's go for the first time shows son or for 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.300
 It's me Monday again that means 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.190
 it can go back to tomorrow 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.620
 is turned off again and some 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.390
 I asked how often do you fly? 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.550
 actually i love every week 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.899
 once in a while and last week 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.180
 times as a special was still in Cologne am 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:56.039
 have turned weekend and the other 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.289
 ask of many was I then alone 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.879
 the company has to pay for it 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:05.270
 otherwise that would be too expensive in the long run 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.270
 can not afford at all 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.680
 is again at the airport to me 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.430
 Now go back to my money and 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.990
 One thing is also unfounded as often 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.259
 I already took my flight today 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.460
 and people's will when I very 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.009
 Tense war was again with 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:29.750
 germanwings last time the fourth 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.490
 hour late annoyed and annoyed 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.350
 for which everything is going smoothly today but 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:46.060
 we never waste any more time 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:46.060
 and cool if you look is 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.710
 stade 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.710
 hans a 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:20.250

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.250
 with yes 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.250
 the well-known ones 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.100
 metric tons 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.550
 unpopular 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.550
 on 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:42.730
 my 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.730
 but 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.269
 because 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.730
 here sometimes 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.970
 in 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:54.970
 apa 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:05.129
 That's how Cologne really does come 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.829
 By now I know what I do every week 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.150
 make beginning to fly something 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.969
 special for me but now would like 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.900
 every week he is supposed to be the one 

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:15.870
 become standard that somewhere too 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.920
 It is a pity, but that's the way it is 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.150
 what can you say, well, cologne airport 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.379
 nothing special anymore the most blatant 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.939
 I've seen so far 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:30.599
 in that is so incredibly big that 

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:33.230
 was so funny because I was with one 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:37.650
 have made series for short cuts and 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.540
 the wada-codes people all seem to be the ones 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:40.739
 have spit on the contrary because 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.079
 they did not like each other 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.439
 that was him as a trainee triste is the 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:49.469
 I've ever seen a savior 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:52.409
 the end of the life was in the morning and in 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:53.639
 Wallau 456 police with all important 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:58.519
 strangely looked at 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:04:01.069
 I thought okay, but I did not fly anything 

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.299
 ye ye but otherwise experienced so 

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:05.659
 strangely eyed though he was nothing 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.659

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.040

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.370

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.200
