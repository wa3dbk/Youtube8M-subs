your<00:00:12.540> link<00:00:12.780> creeps<00:00:13.049> into<00:00:13.320> thinking<00:00:13.799> that<00:00:13.830> a

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
your link creeps into thinking that a

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.189 
your link creeps into thinking that a

bunch of tiny neutral ruling you it

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.810 
bunch of tiny neutral ruling you it
works<00:00:16.379> by<00:00:16.560> drawing<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.070> creep<00:00:17.279> aggro<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.730> the

works by drawing the creep aggro of the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.490 
works by drawing the creep aggro of the
camp<00:00:18.060> at<00:00:18.270> a<00:00:18.330> certain<00:00:18.600> time<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.080> then<00:00:19.289> making

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
camp at a certain time and then making

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.990 
camp at a certain time and then making
them<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.949> meet<00:00:20.130> up<00:00:20.279> with<00:00:20.430> your<00:00:20.580> lane<00:00:20.730> creeps

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
them to meet up with your lane creeps

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.970 
them to meet up with your lane creeps
now<00:00:21.570> different<00:00:22.109> camps<00:00:22.410> have<00:00:22.500> different<00:00:22.800> pool

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
now different camps have different pool

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.439 
now different camps have different pool
times<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.609> course<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.939> could<00:00:24.060> give<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
times and of course I could give you the

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.540 
times and of course I could give you the
exact<00:00:24.840> second<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:25.470> pull<00:00:25.710> this<00:00:26.039> particular

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
exact second to pull this particular

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.400 
exact second to pull this particular
camp<00:00:26.820> I<00:00:27.029> think<00:00:27.510> it's<00:00:27.599> much<00:00:27.750> easier<00:00:28.230> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
camp I think it's much easier to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.259 
camp I think it's much easier to
remember<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.980> general<00:00:29.189> area<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.789> where<00:00:30.000> your

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
remember the general area of where your

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.359 
remember the general area of where your
creeps<00:00:30.510> need<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.840> be<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.560> pull<00:00:31.740> successfully

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
creeps need to be to pull successfully

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.580 
creeps need to be to pull successfully
so<00:00:32.820> for<00:00:33.030> example<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.719> safe<00:00:33.989> lane<00:00:34.230> for<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
so for example in the safe lane for the

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.680 
so for example in the safe lane for the
radiant<00:00:34.950> side<00:00:35.100> pool<00:00:35.850> when<00:00:36.059> your<00:00:36.239> Lane<00:00:36.420> creeps

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
radiant side pool when your Lane creeps

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:43.190 
radiant side pool when your Lane creeps
are<00:00:36.840> about<00:00:37.110> here<00:00:41.329> for<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.420> dire<00:00:42.600> safe<00:00:42.930> lane

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
are about here for the dire safe lane

are about here for the dire safe lane
pulled<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.710> link<00:00:43.920> creeps<00:00:44.160> when<00:00:44.520> they're

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
pulled the link creeps when they're

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.790 
pulled the link creeps when they're
about<00:00:44.910> there<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.960> course<00:00:46.020> for<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.649> big

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
about there and of course for the big

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
camps on the left side of the map it's

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.690 
camps on the left side of the map it's
probable<00:00:48.989> by<00:00:49.140> both<00:00:49.410> sides<00:00:49.739> so<00:00:50.100> again<00:00:50.489> on<00:00:50.640> the

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.310 
probable by both sides so again on the
radiant<00:00:51.090> you<00:00:51.270> pull<00:00:51.570> when<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.989> creep<00:00:52.199> is

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
radiant you pull when the creep is

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.680 
radiant you pull when the creep is
around<00:00:52.680> your<00:00:52.800> qi1<00:00:53.160> tower<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.730> for<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.480> dire

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
around your qi1 tower and for the dire

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.490 
around your qi1 tower and for the dire
it's<00:00:55.320> also<00:00:55.530> around<00:00:55.800> the<00:00:56.100> t1<00:00:56.430> tower<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:57.500> small

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
it's also around the t1 tower a small

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.229 
it's also around the t1 tower a small
tip<00:00:58.710> about<00:00:58.920> pulling<00:00:59.399> is<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.789> if<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.059> look

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
tip about pulling is that if you look

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.279 
tip about pulling is that if you look
like<00:01:00.390> you're<00:01:00.510> going<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> miss<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.930> pool

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
like you're going to miss the pool

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.049 
like you're going to miss the pool
because<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.590> miss<00:01:01.739> timed<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.640> could<00:01:02.820> tend

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
because you miss timed it you could tend

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.310 
because you miss timed it you could tend
to<00:01:03.120> creep<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.510> little<00:01:03.539> bit<00:01:03.840> when<00:01:04.019> you're<00:01:04.110> around

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
to creep a little bit when you're around

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.500 
to creep a little bit when you're around
500<00:01:05.040> oh<00:01:05.159> you<00:01:05.339> around<00:01:05.549> the<00:01:05.640> creep<00:01:05.820> wave<00:01:06.000> this

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
500 oh you around the creep wave this

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.179 
500 oh you around the creep wave this
will<00:01:06.689> agro<00:01:07.049> your<00:01:07.229> wave<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.740> they<00:01:07.890> will<00:01:08.040> follow

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
will agro your wave and they will follow

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.190 
will agro your wave and they will follow
neutral<00:01:08.790> back<00:01:09.030> into<00:01:09.240> your<00:01:09.299> camp<00:01:09.540> this<00:01:10.049> is

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
neutral back into your camp this is

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600 
neutral back into your camp this is
really<00:01:10.560> helpful<00:01:10.799> when<00:01:10.950> you're<00:01:11.220> pulling<00:01:11.430> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
really helpful when you're pulling a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.969 
really helpful when you're pulling a
camp<00:01:11.880> that<00:01:12.090> has<00:01:12.240> a<00:01:12.270> range<00:01:12.720> creep<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.320> also

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
camp that has a range creep in it also

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.499 
camp that has a range creep in it also
keep<00:01:14.189> in<00:01:14.280> mind<00:01:14.460> that<00:01:14.580> different<00:01:14.729> creep<00:01:15.150> camps

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
keep in mind that different creep camps

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.330 
keep in mind that different creep camps
have<00:01:15.659> different<00:01:15.990> movement<00:01:16.380> speed<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.189> no

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
have different movement speed the no

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.770 
have different movement speed the no
camp<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> ghostly<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.420> can<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.750> example

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
camp and the ghostly you can for example

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.749 
camp and the ghostly you can for example
moves<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.560> little<00:01:19.619> bit<00:01:19.799> faster<00:01:20.250> than<00:01:20.430> no<00:01:20.580> more

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
moves a little bit faster than no more

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.670 
moves a little bit faster than no more
camps<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.630> could<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.110> pulls<00:01:22.350> a<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.500> bit

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
camps so you could it pulls a little bit

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.890 
camps so you could it pulls a little bit
easier<00:01:22.979> with<00:01:23.220> them<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.640> know<00:01:24.450> about<00:01:24.540> pooling

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
easier with them I know about pooling

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.080 
easier with them I know about pooling
well<00:01:25.470> as<00:01:25.710> an<00:01:25.920> extension<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.640> Technic

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
well as an extension to the Technic

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.300 
well as an extension to the Technic
double<00:01:27.840> pooling<00:01:28.229> is<00:01:28.409> when<00:01:28.619> you<00:01:28.740> pull<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> next

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
double pooling is when you pull the next

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:30.800 
double pooling is when you pull the next
neutral<00:01:29.610> camp<00:01:29.820> when<00:01:30.060> your<00:01:30.180> first<00:01:30.329> camp<00:01:30.630> is

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
neutral camp when your first camp is

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.609 
neutral camp when your first camp is
about<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.229> die

about to die
double<00:01:32.280> pooling<00:01:32.549> is<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.790> need<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> bit<00:01:33.360> of

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
double pooling is going to need a bit of

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.300 
double pooling is going to need a bit of
practice<00:01:33.659> to<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> feel<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.650> how<00:01:34.920> long<00:01:35.130> each

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
practice to get a feel of how long each

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.859 
practice to get a feel of how long each
camp<00:01:35.610> could<00:01:35.759> tank<00:01:35.970> before<00:01:36.270> they<00:01:36.360> die<00:01:36.509> on

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
camp could tank before they die on

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.690 
camp could tank before they die on

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.640 
average the polar ball cap on the safe
lane<00:01:38.850> takes<00:01:39.030> about<00:01:39.210> 15<00:01:39.810> second<00:01:40.110> or<00:01:40.200> so<00:01:40.350> to<00:01:40.409> die

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
lane takes about 15 second or so to die

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.590 
lane takes about 15 second or so to die
so<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.400> probably<00:01:41.640> want<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.000> leave<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.360> first

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
so you probably want to leave the first

so you probably want to leave the first
camp<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:43.170> double<00:01:43.530> pull<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:43.799> second<00:01:44.189> camp

about 9 to 10 seconds in of course you
