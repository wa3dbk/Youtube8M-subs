very<00:00:30.090> video<00:00:30.300> but<00:00:31.050> it's<00:00:31.349> certainly<00:00:31.590> not<00:00:31.830> a

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
very video but it's certainly not a

very video but it's certainly not a
requirement<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.550> you<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.850> do<00:00:33.030> so<00:00:33.300> anyway<00:00:36.440> the

requirement for you to do so anyway the

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
tinkering with it internally in case

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.810 
tinkering with it internally in case
you're<00:00:45.719> wondering<00:00:45.750> why<00:00:46.200> this<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.250> down<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.700> the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
you're wondering why this is down to the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.479 
you're wondering why this is down to the
fact<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.230> some<00:00:49.230> people<00:00:49.559> are<00:00:49.680> just<00:00:49.739> not<00:00:50.129> happy

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
fact that some people are just not happy

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.119 
fact that some people are just not happy
with<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.700> fact<00:00:50.820> it's<00:00:51.059> running<00:00:51.360> in<00:00:51.480> 800<00:00:52.079> p<00:00:52.350> that

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
with the fact it's running in 800 p that

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.180 
with the fact it's running in 800 p that
would<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.370> 1920<00:00:54.000> x<00:00:54.120> 800<00:00:54.930> I've<00:00:55.140> discussed<00:00:56.039> this

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
would be 1920 x 800 I've discussed this

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.099 
would be 1920 x 800 I've discussed this
already<00:00:56.340> quite<00:00:56.850> in-depth<00:00:57.390> so<00:00:57.750> if<00:00:57.809> you<00:00:57.930> guys

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
already quite in-depth so if you guys

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.020 
already quite in-depth so if you guys
want<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.410> check<00:00:58.440> that<00:00:58.739> out<00:00:58.859> I've<00:00:59.100> linked<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.910> it

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
want to check that out I've linked to it

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.660 
want to check that out I've linked to it
in<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> description<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:01.170> I<00:01:01.289> mentioned<00:01:01.800> but

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
in the description as I mentioned but

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.070 
in the description as I mentioned but
anyway<00:01:04.220> instead<00:01:05.220> they've<00:01:06.060> decided<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.659> use

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
anyway instead they've decided to use

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.780 
anyway instead they've decided to use
the<00:01:07.290> extra<00:01:07.560> performance<00:01:07.799> it's<00:01:08.340> roughly

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
the extra performance it's roughly

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.580 
the extra performance it's roughly
twenty-five<00:01:09.360> percent<00:01:09.799> roughly<00:01:12.439> and<00:01:13.439> they've

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
twenty-five percent roughly and they've

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.859 
twenty-five percent roughly and they've
decided<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.159> use<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.700> so<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.180> four<00:01:15.600> times

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
decided to use this so for four times

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.560 
decided to use this so for four times
msaa<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:16.770> they've<00:01:17.250> stated<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.390> looks

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
msaa and they've stated that it looks

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.640 
msaa and they've stated that it looks
better<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.939> in<00:01:20.939> addition<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.479> their<00:01:21.650> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
better and in addition to their the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.820 
better and in addition to their the
bandwidth<00:01:24.229> requirement<00:01:25.229> for<00:01:25.409> four<00:01:25.590> times

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
bandwidth requirement for four times

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.600 
bandwidth requirement for four times
msaa<00:01:26.840> is<00:01:27.840> actually<00:01:28.290> higher<00:01:28.590> than<00:01:28.619> 1080

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
msaa is actually higher than 1080

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.219 
msaa is actually higher than 1080
without<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.860> now<00:01:32.540> typically<00:01:33.540> games

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
without it now typically games

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.399 
without it now typically games
developers<00:01:34.890> do<00:01:35.220> not<00:01:35.579> utilize<00:01:36.180> four<00:01:37.049> times

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
developers do not utilize four times

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.300 
developers do not utilize four times
msaa<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.970> simple<00:01:39.299> reason<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.530> is

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
msaa the simple reason is that it is

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.730 
msaa the simple reason is that it is
very<00:01:41.610> expensive<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> GPU<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.710> memory

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
very expensive on a GPU and memory

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.469 
very expensive on a GPU and memory
bandwidth<00:01:44.640> so<00:01:44.970> typically<00:01:46.880> developers<00:01:47.880> will

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
bandwidth so typically developers will

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.550 
bandwidth so typically developers will
give<00:01:49.049> this<00:01:49.200> as<00:01:49.350> an<00:01:49.439> option<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:50.100> pc<00:01:50.490> users<00:01:51.560> so

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
give this as an option to pc users so

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560 
give this as an option to pc users so
for<00:01:52.740> example<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:54.060> go<00:01:54.210> four

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
for example you know you can go four

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.569 
for example you know you can go four
times<00:01:54.600> or<00:01:55.020> eight<00:01:55.140> times<00:01:55.200> or<00:01:55.710> whatever<00:01:56.040> MSAA

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
times or eight times or whatever MSAA

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.270 
times or eight times or whatever MSAA
and<00:01:57.259> that's<00:01:58.259> pretty<00:01:58.500> much<00:01:58.619> all<00:01:58.860> there<00:01:58.979> is<00:01:59.070> to

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
and that's pretty much all there is to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.999 
and that's pretty much all there is to
it<00:01:59.310> but<00:01:59.610> console<00:02:00.060> owners<00:02:00.329> generally<00:02:01.079> for

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
it but console owners generally for

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.709 
it but console owners generally for
example<00:02:02.460> they'll<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.479> FXAA<00:02:04.170> or<00:02:05.719> some

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
example they'll have like FXAA or some

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.440 
example they'll have like FXAA or some
kind<00:02:06.960> of<00:02:07.079> aliasing<00:02:08.039> anti-aliasing<00:02:08.910> mixture

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
kind of aliasing anti-aliasing mixture

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.029 
kind of aliasing anti-aliasing mixture
of<00:02:09.569> like<00:02:09.780> for<00:02:10.020> example<00:02:10.080> in<00:02:10.560> Killzone<00:02:11.009> shadow

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
of like for example in Killzone shadow

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.880 
of like for example in Killzone shadow
fall<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.900> idea<00:02:13.230> behind<00:02:13.379> it

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
fall and the idea behind it

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.430 
fall and the idea behind it
basically<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.970> leave<00:02:15.240> here<00:02:15.720> as<00:02:15.870> much<00:02:16.050> as<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
basically to leave here as much as the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.230 
basically to leave here as much as the
jack<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.800> as<00:02:16.920> possible<00:02:17.490> but<00:02:17.640> at<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:17.819> same<00:02:18.030> time

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
jack is as possible but at the same time

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.140 
jack is as possible but at the same time
leave<00:02:18.600> as<00:02:18.810> much<00:02:19.190> performance<00:02:20.190> leftover<00:02:21.060> as

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
leave as much performance leftover as

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.530 
leave as much performance leftover as
possible<00:02:21.720> so<00:02:22.590> what<00:02:23.220> it's<00:02:23.340> basically<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:24.120> seems

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
possible so what it's basically it seems

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.690 
possible so what it's basically it seems
like<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.140> I'm<00:02:25.230> certainly<00:02:25.770> not<00:02:26.130> gonna<00:02:26.400> put

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
like and I'm certainly not gonna put

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.580 
like and I'm certainly not gonna put
words<00:02:27.030> in<00:02:27.240> the<00:02:27.330> develops<00:02:27.720> mouth<00:02:27.990> this<00:02:28.200> is<00:02:28.319> just

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
words in the develops mouth this is just

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.670 
words in the develops mouth this is just
from<00:02:28.770> what<00:02:28.980> I'm<00:02:29.390> personally<00:02:30.650> reading<00:02:31.650> between

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
from what I'm personally reading between

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.580 
from what I'm personally reading between
the<00:02:32.040> lines<00:02:32.190> it<00:02:32.760> seems<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.180> they<00:02:33.780> had<00:02:34.170> like<00:02:34.410> an

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
the lines it seems that they had like an

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.040 
the lines it seems that they had like an
artistic<00:02:35.040> vision<00:02:35.459> they<00:02:36.300> were<00:02:36.360> like<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:37.020> know

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
artistic vision they were like you know

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.780 
artistic vision they were like you know
what<00:02:37.380> this<00:02:37.590> benefits<00:02:38.280> us<00:02:38.780> in<00:02:39.780> kind<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.260> film

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:40.790 
what this benefits us in kind of a film

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.420 
what this benefits us in kind of a film
asked<00:02:41.790> way<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.330> go<00:02:43.319> with<00:02:43.500> this<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.980> also<00:02:44.160> gives

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
asked way to go with this it also gives

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.820 
asked way to go with this it also gives
us<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.670> lot<00:02:44.790> more<00:02:44.850> performance<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.900> therefore

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
us a lot more performance and therefore

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.610 
us a lot more performance and therefore
we<00:02:47.070> can<00:02:47.250> utilize<00:02:47.459> four<00:02:48.270> times<00:02:48.540> msaa<00:02:49.020> now<00:02:49.410> I

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
we can utilize four times msaa now I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.310 
we can utilize four times msaa now I
understand<00:02:50.340> many<00:02:50.670> people<00:02:51.000> not<00:02:51.570> like<00:02:51.870> blank

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320

them<00:02:55.830> a<00:02:55.860> couple<00:02:56.340> of<00:02:56.400> years<00:02:56.430> ago<00:02:56.670> myself<00:02:57.030> why<00:02:57.480> I

them a couple of years ago myself why I
really<00:02:58.500> detested<00:02:59.040> when<00:02:59.220> films<00:02:59.519> did<00:02:59.700> I

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
really detested when films did I

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.640 
really detested when films did I
actually<00:02:59.970> went<00:03:00.239> so<00:03:00.480> far<00:03:00.660> as<00:03:00.720> to<00:03:00.870> an<00:03:01.140> shi<00:03:01.320> zhu

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
actually went so far as to an shi zhu

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.100 
actually went so far as to an shi zhu
min<00:03:01.680> on<00:03:02.070> images<00:03:02.580> so<00:03:03.030> even<00:03:03.269> i'd<00:03:03.390> been<00:03:03.630> losing

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
min on images so even i'd been losing

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.670 
min on images so even i'd been losing
some<00:03:04.380> of<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.760> the<00:03:05.760> whip<00:03:06.080> just<00:03:07.080> to<00:03:07.200> not<00:03:07.380> have<00:03:07.560> to

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
some of the the whip just to not have to

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.110 
some of the the whip just to not have to
deal<00:03:07.830> with<00:03:07.950> the<00:03:08.070> black<00:03:08.250> bars<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.940> so<00:03:09.090> i

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
deal with the black bars and so i

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:10.820 
deal with the black bars and so i
understand<00:03:09.690> this<00:03:09.810> some<00:03:10.410> people<00:03:10.650> really

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
understand this some people really

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.580 
understand this some people really
dislike<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.580> one<00:03:12.450> option<00:03:12.840> i've<00:03:13.019> heard<00:03:13.290> from

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
dislike that one option i've heard from

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.830 
dislike that one option i've heard from
people<00:03:13.800> is<00:03:14.190> you<00:03:14.910> know<00:03:15.030> what<00:03:15.269> why<00:03:15.600> don't<00:03:15.660> you

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
people is you know what why don't you

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.140 
people is you know what why don't you
just<00:03:16.019> give<00:03:16.260> us<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.410> option<00:03:16.650> so<00:03:17.580> you<00:03:18.030> know

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
just give us the option so you know

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.650 
just give us the option so you know
toggle<00:03:18.570> it<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:19.579> which<00:03:20.579> is<00:03:20.730> of<00:03:20.820> course<00:03:20.970> similar

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
toggle it and which is of course similar

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.930 
toggle it and which is of course similar
to<00:03:21.780> what<00:03:21.930> you<00:03:22.049> do<00:03:22.260> on<00:03:22.530> pcs<00:03:23.280> you<00:03:23.549> know<00:03:23.670> you<00:03:23.730> can

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
to what you do on pcs you know you can

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:25.280 
to what you do on pcs you know you can
just<00:03:23.970> choose<00:03:24.360> whatever<00:03:24.600> options<00:03:25.110> you<00:03:25.170> want

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
just choose whatever options you want

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.750 
just choose whatever options you want
but<00:03:25.470> of<00:03:25.560> course<00:03:25.739> it's<00:03:25.920> very<00:03:26.070> rare<00:03:26.430> for<00:03:26.459> a

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
but of course it's very rare for a

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.910 
but of course it's very rare for a
console<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.180> do<00:03:27.329> that<00:03:27.510> because<00:03:27.780> it<00:03:28.500> requires

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
console to do that because it requires

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.920 
console to do that because it requires
double<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.519> amount<00:03:29.579> of<00:03:29.760> optimization<00:03:30.570> really

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
double the amount of optimization really

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.780 
double the amount of optimization really
they<00:03:31.290> need<00:03:31.500> to<00:03:31.650> make<00:03:31.799> sure<00:03:32.100> that<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.430> game<00:03:32.610> is

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
they need to make sure that the game is

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.930 
they need to make sure that the game is
running<00:03:33.030> pretty<00:03:33.630> much<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> fixed<00:03:34.440> 30<00:03:34.829> FPS<00:03:35.579> which

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:35.940 
running pretty much a fixed 30 FPS which

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.840 
running pretty much a fixed 30 FPS which
I<00:03:36.860> suppose<00:03:37.860> we'll<00:03:38.070> just<00:03:38.100> have<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.549> see<00:03:38.579> how

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
I suppose we'll just have to see how

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.280 
I suppose we'll just have to see how
that<00:03:39.030> goes<00:03:39.299> over<00:03:39.600> sell<00:03:39.780> be<00:03:39.840> doing<00:03:40.019> framerate

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
that goes over sell be doing framerate

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.289 
that goes over sell be doing framerate
tests<00:03:40.829> on<00:03:40.980> it<00:03:41.130> anyway<00:03:41.989> now<00:03:42.989> as<00:03:43.110> I've<00:03:43.290> mentioned

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299 
tests on it anyway now as I've mentioned

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.940 
tests on it anyway now as I've mentioned
the<00:03:45.299> reason<00:03:45.600> they've<00:03:45.750> gone<00:03:45.930> for<00:03:46.260> 30<00:03:46.470> frames<00:03:46.829> a

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
the reason they've gone for 30 frames a

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.670 
the reason they've gone for 30 frames a
second<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.430> basically<00:03:48.060> just<00:03:48.299> to<00:03:48.480> reduce<00:03:48.989> the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
second is basically just to reduce the

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.370 
second is basically just to reduce the
impact<00:03:50.220> of<00:03:50.549> the<00:03:51.540> game<00:03:51.750> so<00:03:52.019> in<00:03:52.110> other<00:03:52.230> words

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
impact of the game so in other words

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.020 
impact of the game so in other words
they<00:03:52.500> get<00:03:52.680> pretty<00:03:53.010> much<00:03:53.160> double<00:03:53.579> the<00:03:53.700> length

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
they get pretty much double the length

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.120 
they get pretty much double the length

for anti-aliasing which is kind of a
curious<00:04:11.250> decision<00:04:12.799> if<00:04:13.799> I'm<00:04:14.190> honest<00:04:14.549> what<00:04:14.910> from

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
curious decision if I'm honest what from

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.610 
curious decision if I'm honest what from
the<00:04:15.239> perspective<00:04:15.660> of<00:04:15.750> console<00:04:16.140> developer

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
the perspective of console developer

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.590 
the perspective of console developer
like<00:04:16.769> you<00:04:17.430> know<00:04:17.579> for<00:04:17.789> a<00:04:17.820> PC<00:04:18.120> developer

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
like you know for a PC developer

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.379 
like you know for a PC developer
generally<00:04:19.169> it<00:04:19.229> doesn't<00:04:19.500> come<00:04:19.620> baked<00:04:19.890> in

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
generally it doesn't come baked in

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.170 
generally it doesn't come baked in
you<00:04:22.049> know<00:04:22.169> there's<00:04:22.620> typically<00:04:23.219> an<00:04:23.610> option

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
you know there's typically an option

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.899 
you know there's typically an option
this<00:04:24.840> is<00:04:24.990> just<00:04:25.259> telling<00:04:26.159> this<00:04:26.400> if<00:04:26.580> you're<00:04:26.729> not

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:26.909 
this is just telling this if you're not

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:28.790 
this is just telling this if you're not
a<00:04:26.939> pc<00:04:27.150> gamer<00:04:27.449> typically<00:04:28.319> it's<00:04:28.439> like<00:04:28.530> an<00:04:28.650> option

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
a pc gamer typically it's like an option

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.439 
a pc gamer typically it's like an option
just<00:04:29.009> choose<00:04:29.550> whatever<00:04:29.759> the<00:04:29.969> hell<00:04:30.090> you<00:04:30.240> want

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
just choose whatever the hell you want

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.140 
just choose whatever the hell you want
and<00:04:30.659> you<00:04:30.779> know<00:04:31.009> more<00:04:32.009> power<00:04:32.279> to<00:04:32.520> you<00:04:32.759> if<00:04:32.969> your

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
and you know more power to you if your

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.899 
and you know more power to you if your
system<00:04:33.719> can<00:04:33.900> handle<00:04:34.050> four<00:04:34.409> times<00:04:34.650> MSA<00:04:35.099> a<00:04:35.279> but

00:04:35.899 --> 00:04:35.909 
system can handle four times MSA a but

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.459 
system can handle four times MSA a but
obviously<00:04:36.300> you'll<00:04:36.659> have<00:04:36.749> to<00:04:36.930> ban<00:04:37.229> it<00:04:37.379> the

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:37.469 
obviously you'll have to ban it the

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:40.550 
obviously you'll have to ban it the
balance<00:04:37.830> that<00:04:37.979> out<00:04:38.009> based<00:04:38.460> upon<00:04:38.849> the<00:04:39.569> graphics

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:40.560 
balance that out based upon the graphics

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.800 
balance that out based upon the graphics
options<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:41.069> you're<00:04:41.189> running<00:04:41.629> versus<00:04:42.629> the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
options that you're running versus the

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.749 
options that you're running versus the
resolution<00:04:43.469> and<00:04:43.590> so<00:04:43.800> on<00:04:43.979> so<00:04:44.189> if<00:04:44.460> you've<00:04:44.580> got<00:04:44.610> a

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:44.759 
resolution and so on so if you've got a

00:04:44.759 --> 00:04:47.420 
resolution and so on so if you've got a
really<00:04:44.939> powerful<00:04:45.210> GPU<00:04:45.680> then<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.979> could<00:04:47.189> run

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
really powerful GPU then you could run

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.749 
really powerful GPU then you could run
into<00:04:47.789> that<00:04:48.240> 1440p<00:04:49.139> or<00:04:49.740> even<00:04:50.219> higher<00:04:50.430> you<00:04:50.639> could

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 
into that 1440p or even higher you could

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:52.580 
into that 1440p or even higher you could
run<00:04:50.939> like<00:04:51.120> you<00:04:51.300> know<00:04:51.389> try<00:04:51.629> monitor<00:04:52.080> setups<00:04:52.439> and

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
run like you know try monitor setups and

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:38.250 
what they feel is best for the game then

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.899 
what they feel is best for the game then
go<00:05:38.520> for<00:05:38.879> it<00:05:39.289> exactly<00:05:40.289> what<00:05:40.439> I<00:05:40.469> said<00:05:40.589> about<00:05:40.909> rice

all of that and I have to admit I
personally<00:06:05.279> if<00:06:05.339> they<00:06:05.490> made<00:06:05.669> the<00:06:05.819> right

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:05.969 
personally if they made the right

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:08.570 
personally if they made the right
decision<00:06:06.389> to<00:06:06.569> lower<00:06:06.839> the<00:06:06.990> resolution<00:06:07.259> to<00:06:08.250> get

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
decision to lower the resolution to get

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.790 
decision to lower the resolution to get
in<00:06:08.729> a<00:06:08.849> better<00:06:09.060> level<00:06:09.360> of<00:06:09.569> detail<00:06:10.020> my<00:06:10.379> personal

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:10.800 
in a better level of detail my personal

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:13.999 
in a better level of detail my personal
opinion<00:06:10.889> of<00:06:11.370> course<00:06:11.990> so<00:06:12.990> I'm<00:06:13.169> boar<00:06:13.469> than<00:06:13.680> happy

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:14.009 
opinion of course so I'm boar than happy

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.350 
opinion of course so I'm boar than happy
for<00:06:14.039> them<00:06:14.250> to<00:06:14.580> go<00:06:15.569> this<00:06:15.779> route<00:06:16.789> but<00:06:17.789> I<00:06:18.029> guess

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:18.360 
for them to go this route but I guess

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:19.399 
for them to go this route but I guess
we're<00:06:18.539> just<00:06:18.569> gonna<00:06:18.750> have<00:06:18.870> to<00:06:19.080> see<00:06:19.229> if<00:06:19.319> they

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:19.409 
we're just gonna have to see if they

00:06:19.409 --> 00:06:21.469 
we're just gonna have to see if they
caved<00:06:19.770> under<00:06:20.069> the<00:06:20.399> pressure<00:06:20.759> I'm<00:06:21.300> hoping

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 
caved under the pressure I'm hoping

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:25.639 
caved under the pressure I'm hoping
person<00:06:22.050> not<00:06:22.729> I<00:06:23.729> suppose<00:06:24.629> maybe<00:06:24.990> they<00:06:25.289> could<00:06:25.469> go

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:25.649 
person not I suppose maybe they could go

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:27.379 
person not I suppose maybe they could go
with<00:06:25.860> something<00:06:26.069> like<00:06:26.430> oh<00:06:26.639> I<00:06:26.729> don't<00:06:27.149> know

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:27.389 
with something like oh I don't know

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.300 
with something like oh I don't know
completely<00:06:28.229> just<00:06:28.409> making<00:06:28.800> this<00:06:28.919> up<00:06:28.979> on<00:06:29.279> the

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
completely just making this up on the

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.350 
completely just making this up on the
fly<00:06:29.580> but<00:06:29.610> maybe<00:06:29.969> two<00:06:30.240> times<00:06:30.449> msaa<00:06:31.080> and<00:06:31.620> they

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 
fly but maybe two times msaa and they

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.210 
fly but maybe two times msaa and they
may<00:06:33.360> be<00:06:33.419> a<00:06:33.599> taller<00:06:33.899> image<00:06:34.349> but<00:06:34.589> obviously

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:35.220 
may be a taller image but obviously

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.030 
may be a taller image but obviously
depends<00:06:35.850> on<00:06:36.000> what<00:06:36.240> and<00:06:36.870> what<00:06:37.320> mileage<00:06:37.590> they've

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:38.040 
depends on what and what mileage they've

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.720 
depends on what and what mileage they've
got<00:06:38.190> leftover<00:06:38.790> really<00:06:39.060> on<00:06:39.180> the<00:06:39.270> ps4<00:06:39.570> system
