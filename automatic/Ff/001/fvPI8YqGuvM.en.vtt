00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
playing the rogue he is probably one of

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.210 
playing the rogue he is probably one of
the<00:00:19.300> best<00:00:19.480> rogues<00:00:19.810> in<00:00:19.900> our<00:00:20.050> server<00:00:20.320> which

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
the best rogues in our server which

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.040 
the best rogues in our server which
probably<00:00:21.400> isn't<00:00:21.610> that<00:00:21.789> hard<00:00:21.970> but<00:00:22.240> still

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
probably isn't that hard but still

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.320 
probably isn't that hard but still
whatever<00:00:23.260> and<00:00:23.680> this<00:00:24.400> is<00:00:24.580> just<00:00:24.730> a<00:00:24.880> strategy

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
whatever and this is just a strategy

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.109 
whatever and this is just a strategy
that<00:00:25.359> I<00:00:25.480> use<00:00:25.710> now<00:00:26.710> you<00:00:26.740> can't<00:00:27.220> simply<00:00:28.089> just

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:28.119 
that I use now you can't simply just

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.509 
that I use now you can't simply just
follow<00:00:28.480> this<00:00:28.720> strategy<00:00:29.170> this<00:00:29.380> is<00:00:29.560> just<00:00:29.769> a<00:00:29.920> like

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:30.519 
follow this strategy this is just a like

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:32.310 
follow this strategy this is just a like
for<00:00:30.730> every<00:00:30.970> single<00:00:31.179> row<00:00:31.390> this<00:00:31.720> is<00:00:31.900> just<00:00:32.050> a<00:00:32.140> way

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
for every single row this is just a way

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.100 
for every single row this is just a way
of<00:00:32.349> showing<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:34.090> to<00:00:34.210> do<00:00:34.360> when<00:00:34.660> something's

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
of showing what to do when something's

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.560 
of showing what to do when something's
happened<00:00:35.500> but<00:00:35.680> anyway<00:00:36.010> yeah<00:00:36.640> obviously<00:00:37.030> he

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:37.570 
happened but anyway yeah obviously he

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:38.819 
happened but anyway yeah obviously he
opens<00:00:37.840> with<00:00:37.870> this<00:00:38.050> app<00:00:38.200> and<00:00:38.410> I<00:00:38.440> want<00:00:38.560> to<00:00:38.620> get<00:00:38.710> my

00:00:38.819 --> 00:00:38.829

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900 
see those d-bus at the top right corner

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.920 
see those d-bus at the top right corner
you<00:00:44.260> want<00:00:44.860> to<00:00:44.950> use<00:00:45.100> it<00:00:45.250> straight<00:00:45.550> away<00:00:45.790> if<00:00:46.750> I

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
you want to use it straight away if I

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:48.570 
you want to use it straight away if I
from<00:00:47.080> that<00:00:47.200> I<00:00:47.230> got<00:00:47.410> a<00:00:47.470> blazing<00:00:47.860> speed<00:00:48.130> and<00:00:48.400> I

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
from that I got a blazing speed and I

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.500 
from that I got a blazing speed and I
use<00:00:48.730> it<00:00:48.850> deep<00:00:49.000> freeze

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:49.510 
use it deep freeze

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:52.560 
use it deep freeze
I<00:00:49.540> wanted<00:00:49.840> to<00:00:49.930> cast<00:00:50.110> a<00:00:50.290> polymorph<00:00:50.800> but<00:00:51.640> because

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
I wanted to cast a polymorph but because

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.180 
I wanted to cast a polymorph but because
I<00:00:52.600> was<00:00:52.960> expecting<00:00:53.380> him<00:00:53.440> to<00:00:53.500> trinket<00:00:53.920> but<00:00:54.100> he

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
I was expecting him to trinket but he

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.660 
I was expecting him to trinket but he
didn't<00:00:54.580> because<00:00:55.330> he<00:00:55.360> knew<00:00:56.080> I<00:00:56.620> was<00:00:56.950> going<00:00:57.040> well

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
didn't because he knew I was going well

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.130 
didn't because he knew I was going well
he<00:00:57.910> wanted<00:00:58.120> to<00:00:58.180> change<00:00:58.330> his<00:00:58.450> strategy<00:00:58.690> because

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
he wanted to change his strategy because

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.190 
he wanted to change his strategy because
we<00:00:59.260> already<00:00:59.500> do<00:00:59.620> it<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.770> few<00:00:59.950> times<00:01:00.070> before<00:01:00.490> this

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.200 
we already do it a few times before this

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.649 
we already do it a few times before this
so<00:01:02.340> now<00:01:03.340> I'm<00:01:03.520> on<00:01:03.640> full<00:01:03.820> health<00:01:03.940> he<00:01:04.269> will<00:01:04.479> come

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:04.659 
so now I'm on full health he will come

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.260 
so now I'm on full health he will come
out<00:01:04.689> with<00:01:04.989> probably<00:01:05.170> full<00:01:05.560> health<00:01:05.799> and<00:01:06.270> you

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
out with probably full health and you

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.710 
out with probably full health and you
want<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.509> just<00:01:07.600> keep<00:01:07.780> your<00:01:08.130> yields<00:01:09.130> applied<00:01:09.759> at

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720 
want to just keep your yields applied at

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.570 
want to just keep your yields applied at
all<00:01:11.020> times<00:01:11.320> because<00:01:11.590> if<00:01:11.830> he<00:01:11.950> opens<00:01:12.100> on<00:01:12.370> you<00:01:12.490> you

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
all times because if he opens on you you

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.620 
all times because if he opens on you you
don't<00:01:12.670> have<00:01:12.820> your<00:01:12.910> shields<00:01:13.240> open<00:01:13.480> you're

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
a pattern over because I'm gonna be a

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.940 
a pattern over because I'm gonna be a
fail<00:01:19.990> and<00:01:21.960> now<00:01:22.960> I'm<00:01:23.110> just<00:01:23.260> trying<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.500> card<00:01:23.800> him

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
he uses his cloak of shadows you just

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:27.960 
he uses his cloak of shadows you just
gotta<00:01:26.800> try<00:01:27.040> and<00:01:27.100> avoid<00:01:27.370> damage<00:01:27.760> when<00:01:27.940> he

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
gotta try and avoid damage when he

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.820 
gotta try and avoid damage when he
closes<00:01:28.210> shows<00:01:28.510> it's<00:01:28.810> a<00:01:28.870> bit<00:01:29.020> hard<00:01:29.230> but<00:01:29.470> yeah

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
closes shows it's a bit hard but yeah

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.980 
closes shows it's a bit hard but yeah
he'll<00:01:30.580> use<00:01:30.760> his<00:01:30.790> DPS<00:01:31.240> trinket<00:01:31.630> to<00:01:31.659> try<00:01:31.900> and

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
he'll use his DPS trinket to try and

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.520 
he'll use his DPS trinket to try and
force<00:01:32.230> ice<00:01:32.500> block<00:01:33.360> but<00:01:34.360> I<00:01:34.630> know<00:01:34.750> he's<00:01:35.170> gonna<00:01:35.350> do

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
force ice block but I know he's gonna do

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.280 
force ice block but I know he's gonna do
that<00:01:35.590> so<00:01:35.980> I<00:01:36.010> don't<00:01:36.280> do<00:01:36.430> it<00:01:36.460> and<00:01:36.930> now<00:01:37.930> I'm<00:01:38.080> just
