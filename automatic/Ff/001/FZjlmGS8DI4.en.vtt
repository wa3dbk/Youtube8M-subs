00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.230
 for coasts welcome and a half to this video the goal of this neck wave 

00:00:04.229 --> 00:00:05.430
 returned to the dot com 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.249
 seriously what objective what I want to share with you is 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:12.309
 the management of what is the account that is more about generating cards of 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:13.259
 virtual credit 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.129
 these cards are very important for what 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.739
 as a seller in citibank can apply 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.519
 previously what is the activation in the case of the account 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.599
 already found city and this is my name of the seller 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:28.939
 to be able to do that logically we have to generate a card one 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.489
 card 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.909
 of virtualized credit that card we will enter here below 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.300
 where it says try your products 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.840
 Card number 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.160
 decree of proof 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.440
 and in that case it says to generate a test credit card click 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.130
 in 'edit 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.080
 These cards have a lifetime of usually around 48 hours 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.700
 i only serves to be virtual purchases of your own products 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.540
 and this is a pretty technique 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.930
 putin they do not have that security that recently implemented so they 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.210
 write in the past to not have this means generates a virtual card 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.010
 disappear the evidence 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.020
 of buying these products 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.070
 it was a tremendous safe rollover because a lot of people who knew the data 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.330
 minimum of your account for example my case the name of the seller 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:14.960
 what thing I could do 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.430
 with some more data I could get to what the vice product is because 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.100
 is considered at the time as 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.180
 as a test 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.570
 logically 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.280
 anyone could take what was proposed without paying 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.170
 then let's see how to generate 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.750
 what is the card 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.130
 no longer right let's vote here a button that says avoid 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.960
 we click here 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.300
 i go below where it says 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.930
 cave of your products 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.679
 in that case that test credit card number 

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.910
 logically that there is nothing so we have to tell you 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.500
 clinton says generate mao 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.720
 I stop generating the new card numbers so click 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.630
 here what asks us to become extinct to this code because its code 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.860
 of court 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.220
 that guaranteed that tribal system that this is a process nonetheless is 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:01.990
 something to say 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.229
 is a person who is intruding other codes because the game elements 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:06.460
 Mary 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.099
 every time this sale opens 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:09.840
 so 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.359
 and in the event that he rubbed shoulders he was a little 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:16.339
 illegible or understandable can always the team here to renew that 

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.900
 it is image in this case there are no problems and that nancy where it is finalized 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:24.279
 and this we already have a card number 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:26.959
 number 13 decree of proof 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.849
 we can also generate a card number 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.719
 also have the expiration date that in this case says 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:35.299
 to day 3 of 2011 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.129
 and it refers to the expiration date of the card itself 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.259
 and the deprivation code 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:41.429
 then 

00:02:41.429 --> 00:02:45.919
 the name related to what the card really is is not that when you 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.439
 a test d 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.339
 buying and selling your own products 

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:53.979
 after putting your own I could not be any name building internet i 

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:58.579
 they would also accept what they did buy the evidence of 13 they went with their 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:02:59.499
 data 

00:02:59.499 --> 00:03:03.639
 now very important is that the cards have yes time and above in katyn 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:05.420
 indicates that the test credit card 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.610
 can only be used in the order form that is about to erase all the 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:10.409
 order process of your 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.969
 pasta products on 9 4 of him 2010 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:17.349
 it's a relation to the date that I find it to be day 3 more or less 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:21.769
 it's like a day and a half that is not authorizing to be able to be put 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:22.879
 this card then 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:26.549
 that expiration is due that expiration here 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:29.269
 this card simply disappears 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.069
 disappears and again we will have to go through the same process again 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.090
 it's a way too 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:35.030
 of security 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.910
 because logically yes circulate freely these numbers of this 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:39.799
 card 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.080
 virtual as people any day does what is your account 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.560
 makes a trial sale and took his own 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.429
 that's why they understand 

00:03:47.429 --> 00:03:50.429
 implemented this time restriction usually 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:54.679
 and in this case close to what it is and there he told me is up to 24 hours to be able 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:56.649
 do courses of this type card 

00:03:56.649 --> 00:03:58.429
 then as the lic said 

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:01.749
 principle is that in this way you will be able to reinforce what is security 

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:05.739
 d buy your own in what is mou test 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.759
 why previously you can 

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:12.749
 request what is the activation already of your account as I come now if only 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:14.839
 icahn texts of climate 

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:18.499
 offer affiliate products and you are not going to pretend to sell any product 

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:19.870
 own 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.900
 ccoo of third parties on the issue to resale right you just need it 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.830
 use this option 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.460
 then but that would be lovely instructive 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.189
 and educational thank you very much and we will not be seeing until next time
