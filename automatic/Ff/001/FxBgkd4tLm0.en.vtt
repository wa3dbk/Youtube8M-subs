00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
say whether or not it uses it and then

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.300 
say whether or not it uses it and then
you<00:03:24.430> want<00:03:24.579> to<00:03:24.670> click<00:03:24.849> download<00:03:25.150> and<00:03:26.129> as<00:03:27.129> you

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
can see all be a zip file so if you

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:33.050 
can see all be a zip file so if you
still<00:03:30.370> do<00:03:30.670> not<00:03:30.700> know<00:03:30.940> whether<00:03:31.540> or<00:03:31.750> not<00:03:31.900> is<00:03:32.170> a

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
Lua mod or not you just distract this if

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.930 
Lua mod or not you just distract this if
it<00:03:39.400> has<00:03:39.700> the<00:03:40.000> file<00:03:40.329> extension<00:03:41.049> of<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.950> know

it has the file extension of the know

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.759 
it has the file extension of the know
dot<00:03:43.389> L<00:03:44.139> you<00:03:44.799> a<00:03:45.569> then<00:03:46.569> that<00:03:46.750> means<00:03:46.989> a<00:03:47.200> is<00:03:47.380> a<00:03:47.410> lower

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:47.769 
dot L you a then that means a is a lower

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:51.000 
dot L you a then that means a is a lower
file<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:49.090> will<00:03:49.299> require<00:03:49.660> the<00:03:50.109> lower

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 
file and it will require the lower

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.759 
file and it will require the lower
plug-in<00:03:51.549> however<00:03:52.510> if<00:03:52.810> it<00:03:53.019> doesn't<00:03:53.500> show<00:03:53.739> up

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
plug-in however if it doesn't show up

with<00:03:54.250> that<00:03:54.459> file<00:03:54.819> extension<00:03:55.569> don't<00:03:56.139> worry

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:56.380 
with that file extension don't worry

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.129 
with that file extension don't worry
it's<00:03:56.709> still<00:03:56.829> the<00:03:56.980> same<00:03:57.190> file<00:03:57.549> but<00:03:57.930> if<00:03:58.930> you

00:03:59.129 --> 00:03:59.139 
it's still the same file but if you

00:03:59.139 --> 00:04:02.220 
it's still the same file but if you
click<00:03:59.380> on<00:03:59.530> type<00:03:59.889> it<00:04:00.190> should<00:04:00.519> say<00:04:00.730> L<00:04:01.000> you<00:04:01.540> a<00:04:01.569> file

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
click on type it should say L you a file

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.909 
click on type it should say L you a file
which<00:04:02.950> means<00:04:03.220> that<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:03.669> will<00:04:03.880> require<00:04:04.239> the

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
which means that it will require the

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.890 
which means that it will require the
lower<00:04:05.919> plug-in<00:04:06.370> so<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.359> first<00:04:07.569> thing<00:04:07.750> you

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
lower plug-in so the first thing you
