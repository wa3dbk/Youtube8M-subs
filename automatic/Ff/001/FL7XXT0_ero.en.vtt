00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 exclusively for the site to inform for 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.480
 form conductor but in the company of 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.790
 massimo de paoli director of the school 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.429
 Brescia was then entered in headphone 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:14.370
 In short, you will be back here with us in Sardinia 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.410
 is again the guest of the team led the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.410
 facies as they teach 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.060
 if francesco didn't avoid me 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.570
 together with andrea caristi and I accepted 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:28.260
 willingly to see how I said before 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.359
 first of all because of the Sardinia 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.239
 sound of the Sardinians and they represent for not 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:39.800
 I would like model related to membership 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:44.090
 the culture that remains on this island 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.090
 down second place because 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.480
 every time I get pumped today though 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.790
 I must say that this is what 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.280
 technological 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.470
 far away revenue today has more wanted for 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.450
 which we say I can improve from 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:01.420
 this point of view as an effect on 

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.730
 theme and then interest neither with the players 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.620
 and with the coaches we have known 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.180
 to work in the field is wonderful 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.290
 why 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.850
 because francesco knew how to involve 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.970
 many young people 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.170
 passion 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.240
 emotion 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.240
 I believe this is the basis 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.760
 order to create training paths always 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.980
 more stimulating 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.350
 these 20 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.570
 the protagonists are also there for one 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.160
 school who directs precisely 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:40.000
 Tell us a little experience here is of 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.890
 this age brescia school that is 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.890
 gathering are great results 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:50.140
 yes the brescia school this is the thing 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:54.010
 we tried to put to the brain 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.020
 the property of the sportsman in the center 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.229
 of the project 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.650
 training and therefore the school understood 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.479
 like days in which games and 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.369
 youth sector coaches 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.860
 basic basic activity of 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.810
 brescia with the managers' contacts 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.940
 the finalized city meet 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.070
 to be able to talk about the principles 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.130
 shared methodologies or to be able to 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.180
 view videos that come later 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.180
 analyzed and discussed by the participants 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.620
 some expressed us in a way to form 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.140
 the fate working groups of 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.510
 horizontal or vertical working groups in 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.519
 referred to a little boy who trains the chicks 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.170
 can interact with a breeder of 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.840
 first team as the player 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.480
 important and I believe that this originated at 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.989
 just in a free, almost random way 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.630
 more cognitive paths based 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.200
 on empathy and personal choice 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.630
 of each one 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:49.690
 rather than on a canon or precepts 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:52.090
 imposed from above to which I believe it 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.459
 and secondly because I believe that one 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.250
 brescia school of this type formed by 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.750
 spaces and autonomous staff respect names 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.410
 compared to the standards and always in 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.230
 team 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.510
 can reach those years set 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.370
 those minimum goals of a whole 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.740
 victorian technical order but also 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.650
 educational morality that must connote 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:14.590
 then precisely in the way of conceiving the 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.960
 game and the growth of its players 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.350
 every single professional club 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.300
 such a way from this common but second 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.210
 me it is important to build men who 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.350
 they can try to develop talent 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.380
 then this is there 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:31.960
 or know how to play while having fun e 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.580
 this too is always a form of 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:37.060
 intelligence that we try to inculcate 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.160
 adultery has certainly known many 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.180
 guys who are also trained there 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.730
 in short, they participate in the university 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.100
 members of the school of Brescia 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:49.330
 we can give a little research 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.790
 even if that recipe maybe that 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.590
 perfect and I believe it almost never exists 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:56.710
 They are in any case to have the instructors 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.030
 the most prepared rifles are ever in 

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.520
 sardinia precisely as if this by 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.960
 this however there are there informing for 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.940
 form that follows in some way 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.709
 in short, the indications that that then 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.940
 you with louis and prove you are circles of 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:08.580
 also give in your school 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:13.230
 if I believe that the mind 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:16.950
 history has the resources already its age 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:20.000
 as every person I believe that inform 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:24.810
 to form or train to inform or 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.320
 however interact to build both the 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:31.170
 right way my coming here is not 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.400
 certainly with the presumption of teaching or 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.530
 say something about soccer you can't 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.430
 teach you can therefore learn one 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.380
 form seems to start from those who act not 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:42.780
 never from someone outside has taken it 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.840
 the locus is always external 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.390
 no, what is important is that it is that 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.990
 Francesco is a person but as if 

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:53.190
 really the Sardinians who know how to be isolated 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.600
 islander 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:05:00.150
 when it comes to reaffirming one's own 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.240
 identity but like all the blocks all 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:05.700
 the Sardinians also know how to travel to act 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.800
 on the net or physically really for 

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.830
 to be able to exchange 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:13.310
 a siena journal what I like about 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:14.360
 this is this and this people in this 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.460
 adventure 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:20.180
 and this ability this ability to 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.970
 be local but global at one time 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.770
 sort of blocking effect that already exists 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:26.090
 in marketing but from the point of view 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.550
 social cultural 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.610
 I think it's the right key to be able to 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.970
 make improvements so i think 

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:33.440
 we 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.900
 in this case we can teach 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.810
 because we can see here participate 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:40.550
 with the mister and if we will reach 

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:42.680
 the goal maybe we will succeed in 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:45.319
 to stimulate some of these mister x 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.690
 its own path to perhaps be amazed 

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:51.080
 a bit like those young people are doing a 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.520
 which you were all referring to earlier than during 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.740
 the route to the third to the fourth year 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.080
 begin to enter the state of 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:59.539
 brescia as assistants and why not then 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:02.030
 now maybe some of them will also have the 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:04.990
 pleasure of leading a team e 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.990
 prove your worth 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.000
 ragazzi a massimo de paoli continued 

00:06:08.479 --> 00:06:13.599
 in short, work is the signature of having been 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.599
 here that the sata
