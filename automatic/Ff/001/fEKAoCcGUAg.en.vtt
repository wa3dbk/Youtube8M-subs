00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
product is evenly distributed because

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.800 
product is evenly distributed because
the<00:04:27.840> top<00:04:28.560> hair<00:04:28.949> is<00:04:29.220> a<00:04:29.280> bit<00:04:29.820> looser<00:04:30.150> than<00:04:30.660> the

rest of my hair I scrunch those hair a

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.390 
rest of my hair I scrunch those hair a
little<00:04:33.270> bit<00:04:33.479> more<00:04:33.539> so<00:04:34.259> it<00:04:34.410> won't<00:04:34.650> be<00:04:34.830> too<00:04:34.860> lazy

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
little bit more so it won't be too lazy

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:49.159 
little bit more so it won't be too lazy
and<00:04:35.789> more<00:04:36.210> curly<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:48.120> you<00:04:48.300> see<00:04:48.570> that<00:04:48.810> I<00:04:48.840> really

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
and more curly and you see that I really

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.490 
and more curly and you see that I really
like<00:04:49.380> finger<00:04:49.830> comb<00:04:50.099> my<00:04:50.340> hair<00:04:50.370> so<00:04:51.300> my<00:04:52.050> curls

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 
like finger comb my hair so my curls

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
won't clump too much together and the

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.650 
won't clump too much together and the
reason<00:04:59.009> why<00:04:59.130> I<00:04:59.160> made<00:04:59.490> this<00:04:59.789> middle<00:05:00.210> section

reason why I made this middle section

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.050 
reason why I made this middle section
you<00:05:00.690> see<00:05:01.020> now<00:05:01.229> is<00:05:01.740> because<00:05:02.190> I<00:05:02.220> don't<00:05:02.400> want<00:05:02.880> a
