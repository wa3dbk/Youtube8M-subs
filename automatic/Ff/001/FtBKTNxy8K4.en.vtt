00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
 wei wei wei wei 

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.450
 hello then again let's share them 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.300
 a tutorial the trick is very simple is 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.779
 a sequence of movement that 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.779
 basically it's going to be this 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.919
 well let's divide it into parts 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.310
 we start with a grip of the two 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:35.579
 palms forward 

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.530
 the ring that touches the back 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.260
 we will leave it only in the hand 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.589
 right and what we're going to do is get off 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.039
 the hoop in front of the head and pass the 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.039
 legs 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.540
 I have here I leave it in the right hand 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:56.290
 under the pipe only piece 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:58.840
 the rest is simpler 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.580
 the first trick is to pass the hoop 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.310
 on the back of the hand this already 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:05.040
 we had seen in other tutorials the 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:08.280
 second 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:11.520
 catch the ice cream between your arm and you 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.700
 body and draw the outline of the hoop 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.520
 to pass it back 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.620
 here on the back of the hand 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.020
 caught the hoop and I draw it 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.220
 I have a palms right hand grip 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:29.490
 up I draw it back 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.800
 and here it was only to lower the 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.480
 hoop vertically and pass the 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.680
 legs 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:40.150
 that would be a jump here and a green 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.000
 after the jump 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.730
 what I'm going to give you that is the wool skirt 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.960
 to stay in this position both 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.960
 palms backwards 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.830
 I take a turn that hits the palm of the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.490
 left hand up each side 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:02.090
 to make an entry 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.540
 I draw the outline of the hoop basically 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.930
 it is this 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.479
 pass from hand to hand the pass we can 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.530
 do several times if you want 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.980
 the passage of water in front of the samples 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.980
 back and forward 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.030
 and here the right hand takes the palm 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.290
 forward and outside the side and what 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.959
 coat 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.099
 and then as a whole would be here 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:36.510
 the one on the back the hand catching him jumping 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:40.150
 take it with the arm style left 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:43.010
 CalÃ³ drawing the control not sideways in 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:47.349
 horizontal shape and sacks 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.349
 and then there it goes complete including 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.120
 you can add all the chew 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.670
 and that is all for today I hope that you 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:04.739
 have liked and see you in the next 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.739
 a tutorial see you later bye bye
