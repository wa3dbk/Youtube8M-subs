00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 begins the tsunami here today's data 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.750
 car a little bit bipolar a volvo see 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.639
 40 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.400
 there was a brand known for safety 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.369
 but this is the t5 version to the design facing 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.800
 for performance but I think I made a 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.689
 commercial with this car here 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.400
 commercially led to the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.350
 security but I was impressed 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.420
 with the speed then curious to 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:31.679
 know what time lap it is 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.090
 gonna do what's there is a silly one 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.250
 historically linked to security 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.489
 it is not with this line the designer are 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.010
 singing sell performance is you think 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.570
 which is a sale that makes sense this 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.960
 new attitude 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.309
 I think it brings a drawing to the car one 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.960
 little less square to tell you the 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.879
 I really like the pea 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.750
 that was half a square a month until 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.489
 96 and in nature and tourism has reached 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.300
 to win the test had a quality 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:02.670
 immense in terms of competitiveness but 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.489
 was not aggressive towards the models 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.979
 present a little more round a little 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.380
 so aerodynamic is not about the 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.860
 price of this car 140 thousand reais you 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.920
 you think the directors are 140 thousand reais 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.259
 here in the car I still bet on that 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.210
 car with car safety and a lot of 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.950
 well spent in situations of 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.350
 connectivity will not happen with 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.080
 people here but also knows that they will stay 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.829
 for giving this car has eight hostels 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.689
 death 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.070
 who also remains strong if the thing 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.560
 it will go wrong better than it should 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.380
 ours is the only thing these cars 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.810
 they have the law of the electronic part 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.990
 You can not pull the gear that 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.640
 Do you want a sudden braking as is the 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:47.920
 case of a track in this field when 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.800
 contrary to your non-sequential inventory 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:54.330
 it increases in when facing a 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.330
 home too 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:01.840
 I was pulling but you look at it 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.910
 It takes time to give that, that explains 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.280
 To us because that way is 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.260
 inverted it makes less sense to a car 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.370
 competition, you better increase your 

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:15.970
 the delay in reality is that the 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:19.210
 love is kind of different so know to 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.870
 front to back even for you cling to the 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:25.180
 car for the different otherwise I think it is 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.520
 In this sense, let's see if the 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.520
 against the stopwatch here or 95 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.510
 I'm going to kill insurance then come to 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.020
 stay at ease temptation in portugal 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.020
 steal it 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.709
 do with that car 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.590
 let's go to revolt 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.900
 in counter attack man 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.790
 so know that you notice 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:45.790
 the tide of live acceleration 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.530
 there were 45 2014 turned well but not 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.810
 was able to follow direct rivals like 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.890
 golf gti 30 more horses in the version 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.390
 2015 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.190
 the Swedish will have to receive a new 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.560
 invitation for our quick turn in the 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.130
 super sure as we already said that 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:09.330
 You have a situation here and even more 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:11.950
 security than is than 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.730
 competitiveness because this cart 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.069
 lack 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:16.600
 the marchinhas here behind the wheel if the 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.479
 people would think of something else 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:23.200
 competitive and would be legal. 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:25.780
 because the march here in the exchange s 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:28.090
 you have the situation at the 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.770
 otherwise all you have to do is 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.510
 look to shift gears because 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.419
 quite the opposite 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.639
 This makes it harder, but we have a car. 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:40.950
 that does not need to have anti-rollover 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.950
 because it is quite safe will not overturn 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:52.830
 this is the volvo view 40 and 45 version 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.180
 r design or the design do not know how they 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:58.130
 They realize that we call each other. 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.130
 commercial is handmade design
