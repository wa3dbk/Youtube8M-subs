00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:27.160
 the new five or the first film has to 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.169
 To say then was a completely new 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.270
 have the form language 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:33.370
 notorious hofmeister kink in 

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:34.800
 the c-pillar is the whole cab 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.739
 a bit flatter 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.690
 then we have the front part after 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.199
 in the front, so to speak, is the dynamic 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.659
 Forward 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.000
 this aspiration is pointing forward and 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.680
 which of course must have complete 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.559
 new interior so we have all 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.559
 new cockpit driver oriented 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.309
 with the bmw 5er 1972 middle class 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.300
 change 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.340
 the goal was something luxurious something 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.900
 but more comfortable to come out 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.900
 not to forget the sportiness 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:22.490
 can lead to the office as well as to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.490
 the Adriatic Sea 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.820
 he is on the one hand almost like that 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.540
 something like a board shafer so 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.850
 role model on the other side 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.100
 but he is also a counter so good 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.560
 So is selling the car would 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.430
 a substantial part of the 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.430
 under corporate success 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.530
 and that's what I think makes the bmw movie that way 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:51.650
 especially that he is just the middle 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.870
 So he is, so to speak, the 50 in the 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.870
 So dartscheibe a well in the center
