for<00:00:12.150> yourself<00:00:13.700> that's<00:00:14.700> it<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.059> had<00:00:15.210> your

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
for yourself that's it you had your

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.609 
for yourself that's it you had your
chance<00:00:15.570> now<00:00:15.839> we're<00:00:15.960> going<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> go<00:00:16.230> solve<00:00:16.500> it

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
chance now we're going to go solve it

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.029 
chance now we're going to go solve it
ourselves<00:00:18.289> all<00:00:19.289> right<00:00:19.470> what<00:00:19.680> do<00:00:19.740> we<00:00:19.770> got<00:00:19.859> here

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
ourselves all right what do we got here

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.220 
ourselves all right what do we got here
we<00:00:21.680> have<00:00:22.680> a<00:00:23.359> precarious<00:00:24.359> situation<00:00:24.390> with<00:00:25.109> the

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
we have a precarious situation with the

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.990 
we have a precarious situation with the
Queen<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.650> rook<00:00:25.830> likely<00:00:26.220> discovered<00:00:26.640> check

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
Queen and rook likely discovered check

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.910 
Queen and rook likely discovered check
would<00:00:27.269> like<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.599> move<00:00:27.840> anywhere<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.830> then

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
would like to move anywhere and then

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.320 
would like to move anywhere and then
made<00:00:29.189> them<00:00:29.310> with<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> rug<00:00:29.789> on<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.029> edge<00:00:30.090> file

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
made them with the rug on the edge file

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.759 
made them with the rug on the edge file
but<00:00:30.480> that's<00:00:30.660> not<00:00:30.869> going<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:31.140> work<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.560> now<00:00:31.740> I

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
but that's not going to work so now I

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.160 
but that's not going to work so now I
see<00:00:32.099> it<00:00:32.219> must<00:00:33.000> be<00:00:33.120> to<00:00:33.239> attract<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.780> King<00:00:33.989> out

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
see it must be to attract the King out

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.290 
see it must be to attract the King out
and<00:00:34.440> rook<00:00:34.950> takes<00:00:35.160> g5<00:00:35.610> is<00:00:35.820> clearly<00:00:36.090> not

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
and rook takes g5 is clearly not

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.090 
and rook takes g5 is clearly not
sufficient<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:36.960> this<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.290> made<00:00:37.500> to<00:00:37.530> anyway

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
sufficient and this is made to anyway

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.670 
sufficient and this is made to anyway
and<00:00:38.660> looks<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.989> said<00:00:40.170> if<00:00:40.290> the<00:00:40.379> King<00:00:40.559> had

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
and looks like that said if the King had

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.160 
and looks like that said if the King had
gone<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.920> f7<00:00:41.250> Queen<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.820> e7<00:00:41.969> is<00:00:42.540> checkmate<00:00:42.960> if

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
gone to f7 Queen to e7 is checkmate if

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.709 
gone to f7 Queen to e7 is checkmate if
the<00:00:43.440> King<00:00:43.649> had<00:00:43.770> gone<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.309> h7<00:00:45.059> both<00:00:45.239> queen<00:00:45.570> aged

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the King had gone to h7 both queen aged

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.950 
the King had gone to h7 both queen aged
5<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:45.960> queen<00:00:46.590> age<00:00:46.739> for<00:00:46.980> checkmate<00:00:47.660> so<00:00:48.660> in

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
5 and queen age for checkmate so in

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.049 
5 and queen age for checkmate so in
solving<00:00:49.379> this<00:00:49.500> one<00:00:49.739> my<00:00:50.100> first<00:00:50.399> observation

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
solving this one my first observation

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.430 
solving this one my first observation
was<00:00:51.210> obviously<00:00:51.660> that<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:51.930> had<00:00:52.050> this<00:00:52.199> chance

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
was obviously that we had this chance

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
was obviously that we had this chance
for<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> discovered<00:00:53.160> check<00:00:53.430> by<00:00:53.820> moving<00:00:54.030> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
for a discovered check by moving the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.490 
for a discovered check by moving the
bishop<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.780> course<00:00:55.020> with<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.289> Queen

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
bishop but of course with the Queen

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.080 
bishop but of course with the Queen
hanging<00:00:57.859> you<00:00:58.859> can't<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.309> go<00:00:59.460> anywhere<00:00:59.910> right

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
hanging you can't just go anywhere right

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.270 
hanging you can't just go anywhere right
any<00:01:00.809> random<00:01:01.140> discover<00:01:01.770> check<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.190> the

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
any random discover check that the

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.160 
any random discover check that the
Queen's<00:01:02.489> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.730> be<00:01:02.820> lost<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:04.019> rook

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
Queen's going to be lost so if the rook

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.780 
Queen's going to be lost so if the rook
was<00:01:04.320> on<00:01:04.470> g4<00:01:04.949> hear<00:01:05.189> what<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> was<00:01:05.549> sort<00:01:05.729> of

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
was on g4 hear what I was sort of

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.429 
was on g4 hear what I was sort of
implying<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> Queen<00:01:06.659> wasn't<00:01:06.869> protected

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
implying that the Queen wasn't protected

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.530 
implying that the Queen wasn't protected
is<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.430> the<00:01:08.520> rook<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.909> g4<00:01:09.360> here

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
is that if the rook was on g4 here

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.560 
is that if the rook was on g4 here
Bishop<00:01:09.900> f7<00:01:10.409> would<00:01:10.560> work<00:01:10.770> as<00:01:11.729> well<00:01:12.030> as<00:01:12.060> Bishop

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
Bishop f7 would work as well as Bishop

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.020 
Bishop f7 would work as well as Bishop
to<00:01:12.810> e8<00:01:13.409> actually<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:13.979> long<00:01:14.010> as<00:01:14.310> you<00:01:14.400> gargee<00:01:14.729> sex

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
to e8 actually as long as you gargee sex

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.760 
to e8 actually as long as you gargee sex
and<00:01:15.270> then<00:01:15.780> when<00:01:15.900> he<00:01:15.930> takes<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.380> Queen<00:01:16.650> would

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and then when he takes the Queen would

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.080 
and then when he takes the Queen would
check<00:01:17.009> you<00:01:17.189> take<00:01:17.369> what<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.610> rook<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
check you take what the rook and the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.210 
check you take what the rook and the
king<00:01:18.360> is<00:01:18.630> checkmated<00:01:19.200> on<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.470> H<00:01:19.590> file<00:01:19.860> because

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
king is checkmated on the H file because

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.590 
king is checkmated on the H file because
the<00:01:20.369> bishop<00:01:20.670> would<00:01:20.790> be<00:01:20.909> guarding<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.240> square

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the bishop would be guarding the square

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.660 
the bishop would be guarding the square
so<00:01:22.140> my<00:01:22.290> first<00:01:22.500> consideration<00:01:23.250> was<00:01:23.400> something

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
so my first consideration was something

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.850 
so my first consideration was something
like<00:01:23.759> that<00:01:24.000> but<00:01:24.840> quickly<00:01:25.049> realizing<00:01:25.650> that<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
like that but quickly realizing that the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.350 
like that but quickly realizing that the
Queen<00:01:26.070> wasn't<00:01:26.400> protected<00:01:26.850> meant<00:01:27.090> that<00:01:27.240> we<00:01:27.330> had

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
Queen wasn't protected meant that we had

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.120 
Queen wasn't protected meant that we had
to<00:01:27.509> consider<00:01:27.840> something<00:01:27.960> more<00:01:28.530> powerful<00:01:28.710> than

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
to consider something more powerful than

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.710 
to consider something more powerful than
just<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.369> discover<00:01:29.729> check<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.299> if<00:01:30.570> there's

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
just a discover check and if there's

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:31.969 
just a discover check and if there's
anything<00:01:30.990> more<00:01:31.140> powerful<00:01:31.560> than<00:01:31.650> discover

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
anything more powerful than discover

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.609 
anything more powerful than discover
check<00:01:32.990> you<00:01:33.990> know<00:01:34.079> what<00:01:34.200> I'm<00:01:34.290> talking<00:01:34.320> about

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
check you know what I'm talking about

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.819 
check you know what I'm talking about
that's<00:01:35.400> a<00:01:35.579> double<00:01:35.909> check<00:01:36.270> so<00:01:37.079> drawing<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
that's a double check so drawing the

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.219 
that's a double check so drawing the
King<00:01:38.009> out<00:01:38.159> at<00:01:38.340> first<00:01:38.579> I<00:01:38.729> will<00:01:38.850> admit<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> I<00:01:39.689> saw

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
King out at first I will admit I I saw

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.719 
King out at first I will admit I I saw
Queen<00:01:40.680> takes<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.979> five<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.369> kind<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.579> saw

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
Queen takes you five and kind of saw

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.130 
Queen takes you five and kind of saw
that<00:01:41.850> there<00:01:42.000> would<00:01:42.119> be<00:01:42.150> made<00:01:42.420> but<00:01:42.630> i<00:01:42.689> was<00:01:42.990> still

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
that there would be made but i was still

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.690 
that there would be made but i was still
considering<00:01:43.740> maybe<00:01:43.860> there<00:01:44.070> was<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.189> faster<00:01:44.610> way

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
considering maybe there was a faster way

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.399 
considering maybe there was a faster way
to<00:01:44.729> do<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> but<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> truth<00:01:45.420> is<00:01:45.570> Queen<00:01:45.930> takes<00:01:46.049> d5

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
to do it but the truth is Queen takes d5

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.499 
to do it but the truth is Queen takes d5
is<00:01:46.590> just<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.799> main<00:01:46.979> two<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.490> unless<00:01:48.180> rook<00:01:48.390> takes

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
is just a main two and unless rook takes

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.620 
is just a main two and unless rook takes
you<00:01:48.720> five<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.020> made<00:01:49.200> one<00:01:49.470> then<00:01:50.040> that's<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.630> so

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
you five is made one then that's it so

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.569 
you five is made one then that's it so
again<00:01:51.899> if<00:01:52.049> King<00:01:52.229> f7<00:01:52.649> Queenie<00:01:52.890> seven<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.369> made

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
again if King f7 Queenie seven is made

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.819 
again if King f7 Queenie seven is made
in<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.850> cage<00:01:54.149> 1785<00:01:54.869> is<00:01:55.049> made<00:01:55.200> so<00:01:55.640> absorbing<00:01:56.640> the

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:57.829 
in a cage 1785 is made so absorbing the

00:01:57.829 --> 00:01:59.719 
in a cage 1785 is made so absorbing the
awkwardness<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:58.920> your<00:01:59.250> opponent's<00:01:59.610> position

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
awkwardness of your opponent's position

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.520 
awkwardness of your opponent's position
it's<00:02:00.180> sometimes<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.869> important<00:02:01.320> as<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
it's sometimes this is important as the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.200 
it's sometimes this is important as the
weaknesses<00:02:01.979> when<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.490> king<00:02:02.670> is<00:02:02.790> obviously

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
weaknesses when the king is obviously

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.480 
weaknesses when the king is obviously
open<00:02:03.630> or<00:02:03.840> there's<00:02:04.469> obviously<00:02:04.890> some<00:02:05.250> sort<00:02:05.399> of

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
open or there's obviously some sort of

doesn't jump out at you right away that

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.270 
doesn't jump out at you right away that
it<00:02:18.660> was<00:02:18.750> Bishop<00:02:19.050> g6<00:02:19.440> I'm<00:02:19.590> sort<00:02:19.890> of<00:02:19.980> also

it was Bishop g6 I'm sort of also

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.520 
it was Bishop g6 I'm sort of also
assessing<00:02:20.820> the<00:02:21.090> overall<00:02:21.780> awkwardness<00:02:22.200> of<00:02:22.410> his

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
assessing the overall awkwardness of his

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.750 
assessing the overall awkwardness of his
position<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.040> fact<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.430> Brooks<00:02:23.640> are

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
position the fact that the Brooks are

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.010

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
queen is out of play so you consider

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.380 
queen is out of play so you consider
ways<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.160> can<00:02:29.280> draw<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.580> King<00:02:29.910> out<00:02:30.060> because

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
ways that can draw the King out because

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.520 
ways that can draw the King out because
you're<00:02:30.510> really<00:02:30.720> going<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:31.020> be<00:02:31.110> able<00:02:31.230> to<00:02:31.410> play

you're really going to be able to play
two<00:02:31.650> on<00:02:31.830> one<00:02:32.220> sort<00:02:32.730> of<00:02:32.790> speak<00:02:33.030> right<00:02:33.330> the
