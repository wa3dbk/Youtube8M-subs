00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.559 
has autopilot controls parking brake
gear<00:01:48.359> etc<00:01:49.610> they're<00:01:50.610> all<00:01:50.700> wired<00:01:51.000> up<00:01:51.270> to<00:01:51.329> a

00:01:51.559 --> 00:01:51.569 
gear etc they're all wired up to a

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:55.039 
gear etc they're all wired up to a
microcontroller<00:01:53.179> that's<00:01:54.179> in<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.479> back<00:01:54.689> here

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
microcontroller that's in the back here

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.130 
microcontroller that's in the back here
you<00:01:55.349> can<00:01:55.590> see<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.539> that's<00:01:57.539> hooked<00:01:57.929> up<00:01:58.110> via

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
you can see that that's hooked up via

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.179 
you can see that that's hooked up via
USB<00:01:59.239> to<00:02:00.239> the<00:02:00.270> computer<00:02:00.829> running<00:02:01.829> flight
