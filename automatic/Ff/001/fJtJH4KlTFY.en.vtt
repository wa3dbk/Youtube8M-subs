of looked kind of funny because like I
said<00:03:41.660> it's<00:03:41.900> kind<00:03:42.080> of<00:03:42.200> you<00:03:42.830> know<00:03:42.920> not<00:03:43.430> that<00:03:43.489> long

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
said it's kind of you know not that long

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.900 
said it's kind of you know not that long
but<00:03:45.530> you<00:03:45.709> can't<00:03:46.010> attach<00:03:46.310> them<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.640> stays

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
but you can't attach them and it stays

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.340 
but you can't attach them and it stays
on<00:03:50.030> pretty<00:03:50.330> well<00:03:50.390> and<00:03:51.820> this<00:03:52.820> this<00:03:53.200> in<00:03:54.200> my

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
on pretty well and this this in my

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.850 
on pretty well and this this in my
opinion<00:03:54.760> will<00:03:55.760> look<00:03:55.910> better<00:03:56.120> in<00:03:57.019> the<00:03:57.560> figures

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
opinion will look better in the figures

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.100 
opinion will look better in the figures
hand<00:03:58.130> but<00:03:59.120> then<00:03:59.239> again<00:03:59.360> you<00:03:59.660> know<00:03:59.750> that<00:03:59.959> the

hand but then again you know that the

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:02.770 
hand but then again you know that the
lightsaber<00:04:00.560> still<00:04:00.920> do<00:04:01.130> look<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:02.000> helps<00:04:02.300> the

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
lightsaber still do look that helps the

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:05.050 
lightsaber still do look that helps the
blades<00:04:03.200> still<00:04:03.470> look<00:04:03.650> kind<00:04:03.860> of<00:04:03.950> short<00:04:04.220> but<00:04:04.760> I

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
blades still look kind of short but I

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.180

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:06.389 
waist I think the figure could have

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:07.730 
waist I think the figure could have
benefitted<00:07:06.779> from<00:07:06.810> that<00:07:06.930> especially<00:07:07.229> not<00:07:07.620> so

benefitted from that especially not so

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:09.080 
benefitted from that especially not so
much<00:07:07.860> risk<00:07:08.129> but<00:07:08.310> definitely<00:07:08.639> from<00:07:08.789> the<00:07:08.819> waist

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:09.090 
much risk but definitely from the waist

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:10.969 
much risk but definitely from the waist
but<00:07:09.360> you<00:07:09.719> know<00:07:09.840> whatever<00:07:10.259> it's<00:07:10.620> not<00:07:10.650> such<00:07:10.949> a

but you know whatever it's not such a

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:13.100 
but you know whatever it's not such a
big<00:07:11.400> deal<00:07:11.610> you<00:07:12.210> do<00:07:12.300> get<00:07:12.479> ball<00:07:12.629> jointed<00:07:12.900> hips
