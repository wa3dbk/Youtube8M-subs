00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.409
 and that's all there is to 

00:00:10.949 --> 00:00:14.610
 melhout on the dark night so the 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.410
 third week 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.289
 I know I jumped two weeks I 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.730
 believe or I did not do the series 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.710
 simply because these weeks 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.029
 there I really had very interesting 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.730
 I had bursts of energy and pieces 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.960
 that strange so really I find I 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.820
 could not use you do the 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.770
 videos and the domain of has to have some 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.719
 legendary stuff while I missed 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.149
 a little exotic a little legendary 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.309
 so good enough content to do this 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.500
 that I like in my presentation of 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.760
 wolves on koptas so I'm doing it to you and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.870
 so I will continue to do that so 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.690
 really when I have weeks 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.430
 interesting although I think slow down 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.449
 the pace but continue to quote 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.949
 because I noticed it's a 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.530
 series that likes a lot on my channel 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.789
 as also but opening in g on 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.149
 cynical oath things that you 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.429
 please 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.260
 so that I intend to continue but while 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:02.489
 slowing a little disappointed because we arrive 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.719
 really on the end I think that even 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.190
 you too are turning 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.960
 a little bit about the game and ask yourself what 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.580
 that you are going to do so we hope 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.830
 that the date of the dlc does not go too far 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.200
 of course so here we go 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.260
 immediately started with my first 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.260
 character of my bow and east on 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.550
 which I did not unlock 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.770
 extravagant really nothing special 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.300
 rocket christened a place relative to this 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.060
 that I do not often 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.500
 which is really done just for xp and 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.910
 to be able to ride the day before 32 more 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.100
 quickly look at us and here we go 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.120
 I unlocked the armp red hat or so the 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.950
 automatic rifle 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.330
 personally I dismantle them because 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.280
 that I have the date drivers and we are for 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.510
 I do a lot of woodworking 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.400
 rocket to automatic from since it has the 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.440
 damage to bissau so we see there we go 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.690
 on my little one in number 1 so my 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.170
 main character on which I have 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.030
 unlocked attention 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.909
 armament of the rental of the 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.230
 site in german 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.610
 at 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.990
 health 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.560
 practice and ammo 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.060
 and so on 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.840
 I had for me 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.830
 kill monsters 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:12.800
 only a320 the light vt30 so 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:15.140
 here with his 2nd titan would be unlocked 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.700
 only eleven pieces and france but 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.900
 nothing really bad we're just going 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.400
 not that the video will have pleased you and you 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.200

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.400
 pouting video it was jacques b9 and on 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.400
