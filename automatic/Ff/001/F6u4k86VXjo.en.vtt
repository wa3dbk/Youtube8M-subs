00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.589
 to see all the ladies and gentlemen we 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:11.559
 finds himself with melo player of the team 

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:15.400
 call of duty millenium how are you 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.170
 but the water reaches here we redid a 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.279
 other interview maybe you have 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.130
 seen the previous one 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.710
 we give them a little more focus on 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.970
 him on his game in the team and 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.859
 so 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.090
 since when are you at millenium and 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:30.769
 how were you contacted then 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.480
 officially it's been a month and 

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:34.730
 a few i went back to millenium 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.530
 I started before I played with the team 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.970
 code directly finally with an age that 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.190
 is my master who so the captain of 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.980
 this team there are within two-three months 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.829
 kind in november I came back this 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.600
 in the team because at the level of my 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.970
 individual performance eac 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.409
 confirmed that I was really a plus 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.879
 for the team I brought my come 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.800
 every day actually we have a specific 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.750
 specificities and we each bring a 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.339
 and suddenly it's thanks to my level 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.540
 individual a little bit that made me 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.010
 entered at millenium what is your role 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.809
 in a low team I'm actually slayer 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.089
 I am the person who is going to have 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.500
 do the most kiel ie I 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.110
 am will always have to see me up in 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.920
 the painting and that's my role what I 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.630
 can not make bad league and 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.100
 So he found how it goes 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.040
 precisely because there are two English 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.020
 in the team including mark iv and another 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.670
 which will surely be jake west and jay scene 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.680
 z 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.820
 how's it going with that is it 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 you manage a little English is what you 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.590
 have well communicate in tournaments all that 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.729
 so low in game finally in the when 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.740
 we are in the middle of it 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.869
 rather easy that will be a little more 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.939
 difficult is to have good relations 

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.960
 finally have fun with the outside 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.250
 it's massa bra once I had with 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.409
 English of the low blow at the beginning it's 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.299
 a little difficult as and as my 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.560
 English it improves and suddenly it 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.030
 bump it will go through the shot 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.299
 I imagine that everyone leaves rather 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.430
 less obliged do you 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:54.850
 felli 53 it was in england that's it 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.840
 yeah ben hur King finished 3rd 3rd you can 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.329
 tell us a little about this 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.610
 folder we finished third 

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:02.380
 a result that is personally that 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.939
 I find it a bit bad in the sense that 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.759
 we could have really won this lan 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.380
 quite easily for example the top of 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:09.550
 this event we had beaten already but 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.989
 they beat us rank when we are 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.580
 finally when they joined us they 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.140
 beat us so we did like 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.150
 if the night and if nobody 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.430
 so I think we could have 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.780
 really win this event by setting 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.700
 some communication problems 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.720
 of individual errors if it's 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.819
 really what cost us the victory 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.950
 for me but as and when 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.750
 time has really improved since the 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.610
 site event was in agreement or who is 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.190
 okay or who is so suddenly put to 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.980
 share this insomnia yesterday you planned 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.819
 lan of this year oh yeah of course 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.099
 all there have not been announced yet 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.450
 but the two big events that will 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:42.220
 stay after two rooms that will be 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.959
 the dubbed his worst moments of call 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.209
 is very low there will be two this 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.099
 year there is one in May at the zenith 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.900
 of paris seems to me it will be a tournament 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.030
 call of duty I do not know about others 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.290
 two platforms there will be the other 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.560
 worry at the end of the year at the paris games 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.760
 weekend 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.100
 like every year for two years 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.720
 now and at the level of others 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.670
 brÃ¨venne you will have I finished chicchi and 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.190
 an organization that will be going out 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:06.220
 really in 2015 their goal fr +31 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.959
 end with a lot of cash and I go 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.250
 get in the running to qualify we're going 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.790
 try to qualify of course at all 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.859
 and mnt 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:15.000
 she participates with you if the most 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:17.319
 big event where you are very very good and 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.620
 bombed aside this little focus 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:20.549
 equipped is what you can 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.659
 could you just 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.860
 maybe tell your best memory 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:27.599
 of the donkey a little personal stuff yeah 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.400
 that I lived myself I reduce my 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.409
 first real tournament performance 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.159
 european it was the thought was of 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:34.260
 10 in amsterdam 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.760
 we made a top 3 on their own and 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.579
 not expected at the time I had it 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.560
 oxygen heart he's already gone to 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:43.079
 millenium also carbon young players 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.220
 gotaga's little brother that the share of 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.500
 call of duty players know a 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:49.260
 young player too he was 15 years old at 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.450
 the shoulder and so says luxury that there is also 

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.129
 a nonsense on his hull and if not 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.950
 I would have said also the second but bolt 

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.780
 the sw france the first time it was 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:59.280
 after year that this was going on 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.109
 it was a very good record level so 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.870
 you really have a level climb to 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:05.579
 advance warfare we really saw a 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.980
 boost your side 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:11.030
 is that what's a put 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.800
 strain is what I really like you 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.300
 do new installment rbo is what 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.040
 that motivates and has more time to play 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.299
 What makes you're better in 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:18.920
 did last year on call of duty 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.760
 ghost as its name indicated ghosts 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.290
 that I really did a season 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.960
 ghost what I really do not at all 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:25.340
 touched I 'm not going there really I can 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.840
 to say I really have no tact with 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.430
 I was not happy to play any 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.290
 when I had to 2.27 needs to redo I 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.210
 I'm saying I even prefer blows 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.650
 down I played every day even though I 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.110
 going to class I'm still going to high school 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.870
 me even if I would like to stop but 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:40.100
 monkam will never be so I have 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.770
 played every day let's say I have 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.280
 already 450 hours of people he went out in 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.320
 November 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.880
 ducos and will have a good performance 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.210
 individual which makes that my level has 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.380
 increases 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.300
 I had the impression that there was a 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.850
 little slack on ghost at the level 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.800
 from a little bit everyone we did not have too much 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.660
 more the game was really not pleasant to 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.000
 to play 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:01.760
 finally how to say the blade and current on 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:03.169
 the game was in a draw and in andorre 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.570
 it was the world could be good then 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.460
 that did not mean anything ok then 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.410
 that in the evening refuses a pain of 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:11.570
 teeth you can talk to us a little bit about 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.400
 maps of voting weapons that make that 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.630
 it's a little better then what 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.190
 really change everything about the game it's 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.900
 the dash ie it's a little bit 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.520
 the halo we can double james it's up to 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.080
 say we can instead of doing only one 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.580
 jump on the old opus one can in 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:24.140
 so it really helps you 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.500
 do a lot of moov the right tactic 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.390
 etc. 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:28.070
 the dash as it allows to have 

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:29.690
 a lot more fluidity in the game the 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:31.190
 much more fluid game also the 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.560
 armies are really balanced apart 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.330
 one after a patch that is to say that 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.500
 positively roasting times make 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.210
 updates ie the asm has 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.380
 now it's a weapon that is a bit 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.789
 similar to the victory over others 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.780
 games and do you really have a lot more 

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.539
 quickly as some others and in 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.530
 what is it that some people preferred 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:47.330
 while using it everyone 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.700
 uses a vector with an audience and 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.600
 asm in real life and with Basel 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:55.310
 the two youngest weapons 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.660
 ok ok ben good deal here is to thank you 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.600
 have a little bit 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:06:00.740
 we are soon on 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.720
