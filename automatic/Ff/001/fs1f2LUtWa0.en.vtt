the the very very dark blue these Scouts

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.340 
the the very very dark blue these Scouts
all<00:00:55.949> have<00:00:56.129> custom<00:00:56.640> cloaks<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.539> each<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.050> every

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
all have custom cloaks so each and every

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.170 
all have custom cloaks so each and every
one<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> little<00:00:59.129> bit<00:00:59.280> different<00:00:59.640> which<00:01:00.090> i

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
one is a little bit different which i

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.510 
one is a little bit different which i
think<00:01:00.390> is<00:01:00.480> a<00:01:00.510> nice<00:01:00.750> feature<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.520> something

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
think is a nice feature and something

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.520 
think is a nice feature and something
that<00:01:02.730> could<00:01:02.910> have<00:01:03.000> just<00:01:03.210> easily<00:01:03.690> been<00:01:03.899> not

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
that could have just easily been not

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.640 
that could have just easily been not
done<00:01:04.890> because<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.580> scouts<00:01:05.880> do<00:01:06.180> have<00:01:06.650> cloaks

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
done because the scouts do have cloaks

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.490 
done because the scouts do have cloaks
