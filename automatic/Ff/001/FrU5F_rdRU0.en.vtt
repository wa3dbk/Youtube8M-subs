00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
do it in the middle we will start with

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:09.630 
do it in the middle we will start with
the<00:01:02.559> top<00:01:02.860> ones<00:01:06.450> and<00:01:07.560> see<00:01:08.560> how<00:01:08.740> big<00:01:08.979> the<00:01:09.340> chunk

and<00:01:20.300> I<00:01:20.990> like<00:01:21.500> mine<00:01:22.040> to<00:01:22.340> sit<00:01:23.150> up<00:01:23.600> and<00:01:23.990> then<00:01:24.470> I

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
and I like mine to sit up and then I

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:32.429 
and I like mine to sit up and then I
just<00:01:24.770> put<00:01:25.040> it<00:01:25.210> straight<00:01:26.210> through<00:01:26.660> that

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:32.439 

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:35.490 

another<00:01:33.340> little<00:01:33.790> tiny<00:01:34.240> section<00:01:34.899> if<00:01:35.079> you<00:01:35.469> want

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
another little tiny section if you want

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.130 
another little tiny section if you want
you<00:01:35.890> can<00:01:36.100> actually<00:01:36.219> brush<00:01:36.700> through<00:01:37.329> it<00:01:37.420> I

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
you can actually brush through it I

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:46.710 
you can actually brush through it I
would<00:01:39.100> suggest<00:01:39.340> you<00:01:39.759> do<00:01:39.969> so<00:01:45.210> depending<00:01:46.210> also

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:46.720 
would suggest you do so depending also

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.690 
would suggest you do so depending also
you<00:01:47.140> can<00:01:47.320> open<00:01:47.649> up<00:01:47.710> your<00:01:47.770> fingers<00:01:48.250> or<00:01:48.429> use

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
you can open up your fingers or use

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:59.930 
you can open up your fingers or use
three<00:01:48.970> fingers

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.080 

I<00:02:00.000> learned<00:02:00.690> I'm<00:02:00.840> doing<00:02:01.140> smaller<00:02:01.680> sections<00:02:02.670> for

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
I learned I'm doing smaller sections for

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.600 
I learned I'm doing smaller sections for
my<00:02:03.300> hair<00:02:03.630> since<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.470> have<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> lot<00:02:05.010> of<00:02:05.220> it<00:02:05.430> and

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
my hair since I have a lot of it and

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.560 
my hair since I have a lot of it and
it's<00:02:05.760> long<00:02:06.440> it's<00:02:07.440> easier<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.520> do<00:02:08.640> smaller<00:02:09.090> ones

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:09.570 
it's long it's easier to do smaller ones

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:12.500 
it's long it's easier to do smaller ones
because<00:02:09.900> a<00:02:10.520> they're<00:02:11.520> going<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> set<00:02:12.120> quicker

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
because a they're going to set quicker

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.240 
because a they're going to set quicker
because<00:02:13.170> you<00:02:13.290> don't<00:02:13.470> have<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.620> bunch<00:02:13.860> of<00:02:14.010> hair

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
because you don't have a bunch of hair

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.130 
because you don't have a bunch of hair
all<00:02:14.850> in<00:02:14.910> one<00:02:15.780> little<00:02:16.320> pin<00:02:17.250> curl<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.750> then

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
all in one little pin curl and and then

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.650 
all in one little pin curl and and then
since<00:02:19.920> your<00:02:20.070> hair<00:02:20.280> is<00:02:20.430> so<00:02:20.640> heavy<00:02:20.970> it's<00:02:21.540> going

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
since your hair is so heavy it's going

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.070 
since your hair is so heavy it's going
to<00:02:21.720> be<00:02:21.810> harder<00:02:22.140> for<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.410> to<00:02:22.700> keep<00:02:23.700> a<00:02:23.970> hold<00:02:24.420> with

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
to be harder for it to keep a hold with

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.280 
to be harder for it to keep a hold with
so<00:02:25.650> much<00:02:25.860> hair<00:02:26.390> do<00:02:27.390> a<00:02:27.420> couple<00:02:27.810> more<00:02:27.990> with<00:02:28.170> these

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
so much hair do a couple more with these

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.890 
so much hair do a couple more with these
big<00:02:28.590> ones<00:02:28.740> and<00:02:29.010> then<00:02:29.130> the<00:02:29.250> rest<00:02:29.520> are<00:02:29.900> with

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
big ones and then the rest are with

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.830 
big ones and then the rest are with
bobby<00:02:31.560> pins<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.640> bobby<00:02:32.880> pin<00:02:33.240> ones<00:02:33.480> I<00:02:33.600> lay

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
bobby pins and the bobby pin ones I lay

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.820 
bobby pins and the bobby pin ones I lay
them<00:02:34.050> flat<00:02:35.240> okay<00:02:36.240> now<00:02:36.420> I<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.780> all<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.320> top<00:02:37.560> of

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
them flat okay now I have all the top of

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.860 
them flat okay now I have all the top of
my<00:02:38.430> head<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:39.090> way<00:02:39.240> I<00:02:39.270> like<00:02:39.630> it

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
my head the way I like it

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.740 
my head the way I like it
sitting<00:02:40.620> up<00:02:40.830> I<00:02:41.250> just<00:02:41.460> like<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.880> way<00:02:42.120> I<00:02:42.480> feel

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
sitting up I just like the way I feel

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.350 
sitting up I just like the way I feel
like<00:02:42.870> it's<00:02:43.080> pulling<00:02:43.560> more<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:44.220> my<00:02:44.400> roots<00:02:44.700> up<00:02:44.910> um

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
like it's pulling more of my roots up um

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.640 
like it's pulling more of my roots up um
if<00:02:46.260> they're<00:02:46.560> drawing<00:02:47.010> this<00:02:47.520> way<00:02:48.140> so<00:02:49.140> now<00:02:49.320> we're

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
if they're drawing this way so now we're

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.450 
if they're drawing this way so now we're
going<00:02:49.770> to<00:02:49.830> move<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.520> to<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:52.350> bobby<00:02:52.770> pins<00:02:53.070> which

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
going to move on to the bobby pins which

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.400 
going to move on to the bobby pins which
this<00:02:54.030> is<00:02:54.210> very<00:02:54.390> time-consuming<00:02:54.630> because<00:02:55.140> we

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
this is very time-consuming because we

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:04.220 
this is very time-consuming because we
