 are the following one the first thing that 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.719
 you should do is make sure you cook 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.579

 preferably raw and without any 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.960
 fat since this is half of the 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.090
 foods that should be consumed by 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.010
 a person with diabetes 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.830

 infrequently and they should be cuts 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.750

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.030
 you can do to give them flavor is to use 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.670

 vinegar or lemon in meals 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.549
 6 If you want other dressings you should 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.110
 take care that these do not have much fat or 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.110
