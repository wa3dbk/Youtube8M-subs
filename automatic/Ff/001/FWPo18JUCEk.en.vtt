couple<00:00:49.460> of<00:00:49.579> cable<00:00:50.270> channels<00:00:50.450> I<00:00:50.960> think<00:00:51.110> it<00:00:51.200> was

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
couple of cable channels I think it was

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.490 
couple of cable channels I think it was
a<00:00:51.320> History<00:00:51.590> Channel<00:00:51.950> and<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.310> Emmy<00:00:53.350> but<00:00:54.350> they

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
a History Channel and a Emmy but they

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.290 
a History Channel and a Emmy but they
chopped<00:00:55.130> it<00:00:55.220> up<00:00:55.310> a<00:00:55.400> little<00:00:55.520> bit<00:00:55.700> they<00:00:55.790> got<00:00:56.180> rid

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
chopped it up a little bit they got rid

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.690 
chopped it up a little bit they got rid
of<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.510> original<00:00:56.900> opening<00:00:57.020> and<00:00:57.700> closing

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
of the original opening and closing

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.430 
of the original opening and closing
credits<00:00:58.850> and<00:00:59.329> the<00:00:59.390> music<00:00:59.750> which<00:00:59.899> was<00:01:00.020> one<00:01:00.350> of

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
credits and the music which was one of

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.040 
credits and the music which was one of
the<00:01:00.500> best<00:01:00.649> parts<00:01:00.890> of<00:01:00.950> the<00:01:01.040> show<00:01:01.250> and<00:01:01.910> they<00:01:02.720> cut

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 
the best parts of the show and they cut

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.270 
the best parts of the show and they cut
out<00:01:03.140> some<00:01:03.320> of<00:01:03.410> the<00:01:03.530> host<00:01:03.770> segments<00:01:04.189> with

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
out some of the host segments with

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.530 
out some of the host segments with
Leonard<00:01:04.519> Nimoy<00:01:04.759> I<00:01:04.790> think<00:01:05.149> because<00:01:05.390> his

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
Leonard Nimoy I think because his

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.850 
Leonard Nimoy I think because his
clothes<00:01:05.840> looked<00:01:06.049> too<00:01:06.170> 70s<00:01:06.590> and<00:01:06.680> they<00:01:06.770> were

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
clothes looked too 70s and they were

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.780 
clothes looked too 70s and they were
trying<00:01:06.950> to<00:01:07.070> make<00:01:07.130> the<00:01:07.250> show<00:01:07.399> look<00:01:07.610> a<00:01:07.670> little

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:07.790 
trying to make the show look a little

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.330 
trying to make the show look a little
bit<00:01:07.970> newer<00:01:08.180> than<00:01:08.270> it<00:01:08.479> really<00:01:08.600> was

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
bit newer than it really was

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.289 
bit newer than it really was
anyway<00:01:10.340> I<00:01:10.369> never<00:01:10.490> had<00:01:10.759> much<00:01:10.909> hope<00:01:11.090> that<00:01:11.119> the

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
anyway I never had much hope that the

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.120 
anyway I never had much hope that the
show<00:01:11.479> would<00:01:11.600> get<00:01:11.750> an<00:01:12.049> official<00:01:12.439> DVD<00:01:12.590> release

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
goose in the early 2000s it was a new

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:55.280 
goose in the early 2000s it was a new
show<00:03:52.200> long<00:03:53.100> lasted<00:03:53.430> eight<00:03:53.520> episodes<00:03:54.290> and

I<00:03:56.900> mean<00:03:57.900> it<00:03:57.990> also<00:03:58.110> does<00:03:58.350> include<00:03:58.590> the<00:03:58.880> rut

00:03:59.870 --> 00:03:59.880 
I mean it also does include the rut

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.370 
I mean it also does include the rut
sterling<00:04:00.180> episodes<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.600> was<00:04:00.660> -<00:04:00.900> I<00:04:01.170> believe

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
sterling episodes it was - I believe

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.810 
sterling episodes it was - I believe
their<00:04:01.500> TV<00:04:01.740> movies<00:04:02.130> that<00:04:02.250> came<00:04:02.370> out<00:04:02.520> before<00:04:02.610> the
