00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.900 

maybe<00:01:46.620> I'll<00:01:46.710> take<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.980> while<00:01:47.220> because<00:01:47.670> the

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
maybe I'll take a while because the

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.910 
maybe I'll take a while because the
fondants<00:01:48.420> really<00:01:48.690> thin<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.290> I<00:01:49.320> don't<00:01:49.680> want<00:01:49.860> to

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
fondants really thin so I don't want to

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:57.140 
fondants really thin so I don't want to
tear<00:01:50.340> it<00:01:55.040> it<00:01:56.040> is<00:01:56.250> helpful<00:01:56.640> to<00:01:56.790> have<00:01:56.940> the

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:57.150 
tear it it is helpful to have the

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.820 
tear it it is helpful to have the
fondant<00:01:57.630> be<00:01:57.720> thin<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.200> can<00:01:58.440> see<00:01:58.650> your

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
fondant be thin so you can see your

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:00.469 
fondant be thin so you can see your
design<00:01:59.160> underneath<00:01:59.670> but<00:01:59.910> it<00:01:59.970> makes<00:02:00.270> it

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
design underneath but it makes it

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.110 
design underneath but it makes it
challenging<00:02:01.470> as<00:02:02.010> you're<00:02:02.220> writing<00:02:02.490> on<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.970> and

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:03.120 
challenging as you're writing on it and

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.440 
challenging as you're writing on it and
stuff<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.630> don't<00:02:03.660> want<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.940> tear<00:02:05.940> it<00:02:05.970> by

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
stuff you don't want to tear it by

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:15.110 
stuff you don't want to tear it by
pushing<00:02:06.780> too<00:02:06.960> hard

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.009 

and<00:02:15.720> you<00:02:15.989> keep<00:02:16.200> going<00:02:16.260> until<00:02:16.860> you<00:02:17.099> get<00:02:17.930> it<00:02:18.930> all

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
and you keep going until you get it all

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:26.300 
and you keep going until you get it all
colored<00:02:19.560> in<00:02:24.410> once<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.560> have<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.769> all<00:02:25.890> colored

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
colored in once you have it all colored

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:37.230 
colored in once you have it all colored
in<00:02:26.459> then<00:02:27.030> you<00:02:27.239> go<00:02:27.390> around<00:02:27.540> and<00:02:27.930> cut<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.290> out

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:54.120 

right<00:02:37.870> around<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.380> edge

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.070 

you<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:54.940> do<00:02:55.090> this<00:02:55.270> with<00:02:55.510> any<00:02:56.200> kind<00:02:56.740> of<00:02:57.160> picture

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
you can do this with any kind of picture

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.500 
you can do this with any kind of picture
you<00:02:59.080> can<00:02:59.290> put<00:03:00.220> a<00:03:00.250> picture<00:03:00.670> underneath<00:03:00.970> roll
