 Italian marble is finally here 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:23.929
 In principle, we can deliver immediately 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:27.890

 Merrill 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.510

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.429
 no matter he did 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.429
 he demanded there 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.730
 at the top ten

 what had the customer got up 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.800
