00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.889
 on 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.809
 I welcome you to another almost three minutes as the Rostocker 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.310
 Torsten Bator 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.080
 yes I would like to introduce you in the video only briefly the new operating system 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.170
 Perisic is already the structure is completely different who my new check 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.390
 Indeed, and the primary the auditors 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.970
 of course, there are still significant and low glyphs 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.620
 and yes the biggest change is of course as soon as you get help from 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.160
 Ben for inscriptions Kundler or from the auction house 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.290
 bought 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.830
 And having learned this part, the permanent new quick set remains easy 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.000
 my fireman in the coolest book 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.860
 and that one sees right here 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.850
 and then you can roll it and swap glyphs back and forth we want the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.330
 all you need is one 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.500
 a smaller one in addition shows that one sees that below is 12 and then 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.200
 Besides 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.080
 Dust of disappearing 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.010
 and that leaves almost the current books 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.350
 For me, that shows us maybe 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.600
 and as you look into that dust, we just swirl it around glyphs too 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.760
 I replace now very short info text interrupted and that fine dust 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:20.220
 is sold by inscriptions countries and manufactured by writers 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.470
 first coercion to remove mighty air so that new ones are inserted 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.350
 can 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.720
 to use a revolution Christmas or higher 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.850
 you see their object to club 80 Reason yes we need this dust 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.800
 just to replace glyphs we once learned permanently and year 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.740
 the glyphs we see right here now i am at the substantial 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.160
 These are the three 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.830
 middle rings are like this now just say 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.820
 Now you can just as often as these perspectives and it just works 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.360
 these reagents 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.550
 it's in quotes and not the glyph itself anymore 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.770
 is up to date 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.250
 to conclave for inscriptions me this is of course a clichÃ© 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.390
 Advantage Lacko senseless as now absolutely no more gold with it 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.120
 To be able to experience a profession 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.570
 but now you look well how it developed even with this dust 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.839
 it still is Peter 

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:15.869
 no idea I can do that later only inscriptions Counter or 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:16.929
 so 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.469
 Yes I know 

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:25.029
 yeah you see it all the time here who chooses the glyphs exchange and 

00:02:25.029 --> 00:02:28.349
 he put the system is understandable as far as it is quite simple as well 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:30.639
 Just say that dust 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:34.549
 and glyphs that you once learned stay permanently then must 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:38.589
 serve and make tonight Saturday on Sunday to come back 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:40.279
 get a new provider 

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.689
 Let's see what change is otherwise Germany to look at 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.649
 I'll just say until the next video of a place FINA
