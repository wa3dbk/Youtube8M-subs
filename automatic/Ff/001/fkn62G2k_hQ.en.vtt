let's go guys Adam from Orlando's robber

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.390 
let's go guys Adam from Orlando's robber
calm<00:00:12.360> the<00:00:12.630> new<00:00:12.750> video<00:00:12.990> for<00:00:13.320> you<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.620> had<00:00:14.160> a<00:00:14.219> few

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
calm the new video for you I had a few

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.250 
calm the new video for you I had a few
people<00:00:14.490> ask<00:00:14.849> about<00:00:15.120> some<00:00:15.480> hi-hat<00:00:15.900> technique

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
people ask about some hi-hat technique

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.840 
people ask about some hi-hat technique
stuff<00:00:16.529> which<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:16.830> kind<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.160> surprising<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.670> me

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
stuff which is kind of surprising to me

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.880 
stuff which is kind of surprising to me
because<00:00:18.480> I<00:00:18.630> only<00:00:18.660> do<00:00:19.020> like<00:00:19.260> three<00:00:19.590> or<00:00:19.710> four

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
because I only do like three or four

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.830 
because I only do like three or four
different<00:00:20.070> things<00:00:20.400> on<00:00:20.550> high<00:00:20.970> hat<00:00:21.180> so<00:00:21.810> I

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
different things on high hat so I

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.790 
different things on high hat so I
figured<00:00:22.140> that<00:00:22.230> would<00:00:22.350> be<00:00:22.410> a<00:00:22.439> really<00:00:22.650> easy

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
figured that would be a really easy

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.529 
figured that would be a really easy
video<00:00:23.369> for<00:00:23.640> me<00:00:23.699> to<00:00:23.730> make<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.180> break<00:00:24.359> down<00:00:24.480> a

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
video for me to make to break down a

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.000 
video for me to make to break down a
couple<00:00:24.840> of<00:00:25.019> techniques<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.619> little<00:00:25.800> tricks

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
couple of techniques and little tricks

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:27.980 
couple of techniques and little tricks
that<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.279> use<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.580> hi-hat<00:00:26.939> I'm<00:00:27.630> going<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.900> go

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
that I use in the hi-hat I'm going to go

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.960 
that I use in the hi-hat I'm going to go
over<00:00:28.140> three<00:00:28.470> main<00:00:28.800> things<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.490> do

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
over three main things that I do

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.139 
over three main things that I do
the<00:00:30.539> first<00:00:30.840> was<00:00:31.199> kind<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.560> big<00:00:31.830> big<00:00:32.790> stepping

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
the first was kind of a big big stepping

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.549 
the first was kind of a big big stepping
stone<00:00:33.210> for<00:00:33.510> me<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.750> my<00:00:33.809> playing<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.320> couple

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
stone for me and my playing so a couple

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.319 
stone for me and my playing so a couple
years<00:00:34.680> ago<00:00:34.920> when<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.250> first<00:00:35.489> was<00:00:36.059> kind<00:00:36.270> of

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
years ago when I first was kind of

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.209 
years ago when I first was kind of
introduced<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:36.960> backhand<00:00:37.440> technique<00:00:37.620> or

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
introduced to the backhand technique or

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.979 
introduced to the backhand technique or
kind<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.730> flick<00:00:39.030> technique<00:00:39.450> whatever<00:00:39.750> you

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
kind of the flick technique whatever you

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.110 
kind of the flick technique whatever you
what<00:00:40.649> are<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.770> going<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:40.950> call<00:00:41.100> it<00:00:41.160> but<00:00:42.000> it's

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
what are you going to call it but it's

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.520 
what are you going to call it but it's
pretty<00:00:42.270> much<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.450> idea<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.230> don't

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
pretty much this idea that you don't

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.610 
pretty much this idea that you don't
take<00:00:44.250> your<00:00:44.520> left<00:00:44.789> hand<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.360> from<00:00:46.260> underneath

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
take your left hand out from underneath

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.229 
take your left hand out from underneath
your<00:00:46.920> right<00:00:47.100> hand<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.579> play<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> hi-hat

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
your right hand to play on the hi-hat

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.910 
your right hand to play on the hi-hat
with<00:00:48.600> your<00:00:48.750> left<00:00:48.989> okay<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:49.410> used<00:00:49.590> to<00:00:49.680> kind<00:00:49.890> of

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
with your left okay so I used to kind of

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.790 
with your left okay so I used to kind of
remove<00:00:50.250> my<00:00:50.879> left<00:00:51.090> hand<00:00:51.390> from<00:00:51.510> underneath<00:00:51.870> my

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
remove my left hand from underneath my

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.860 
remove my left hand from underneath my
right<00:00:52.949> hand<00:00:53.250> bring<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> outside<00:00:54.149> and

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
right hand bring it to the outside and

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.180 
right hand bring it to the outside and
then<00:00:54.989> play<00:00:55.140> up<00:00:55.260> my<00:00:55.350> high<00:00:55.530> hat<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.890> then<00:00:56.010> bring

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
then play up my high hat and then bring

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.340 
then play up my high hat and then bring
it<00:00:56.280> back<00:00:56.309> under<00:00:56.730> when<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.910> was<00:00:57.090> done<00:00:57.350> and

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
it back under when I was done and

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.959 
it back under when I was done and
there's<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> much<00:00:59.070> more<00:00:59.100> efficient<00:00:59.640> way<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.789> do

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
there's a much more efficient way to do

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.459 
there's a much more efficient way to do
that<00:01:00.120> using<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.539> backhand<00:01:00.989> technique<00:01:01.140> or

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
that using this backhand technique or

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.549 
that using this backhand technique or
this<00:01:01.559> flick<00:01:02.039> hit<00:01:03.140> I'm<00:01:04.140> going<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
this flick hit I'm going to have a

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.230 
this flick hit I'm going to have a
couple<00:01:04.830> pictures<00:01:05.010> they<00:01:05.580> kind<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.820> explain

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
couple pictures they kind of explain

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.670 
couple pictures they kind of explain
what<00:01:06.540> this<00:01:06.689> is<00:01:06.930> because<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.380> me<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.530> didn't

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
what this is because to me I didn't

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.500 
what this is because to me I didn't
really<00:01:07.830> understand<00:01:08.220> how<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.580> worked<00:01:08.939> until

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
really understand how this worked until

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.179 
really understand how this worked until
some<00:01:09.750> well<00:01:09.900> someone<00:01:10.290> kind<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.560> explained<00:01:10.979> this

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
some well someone kind of explained this

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.399 
some well someone kind of explained this
oval<00:01:11.640> concepts<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.360> me<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.020> oval

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
oval concepts of me with the oval

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.530 
oval concepts of me with the oval
concept<00:01:13.860> is<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.220> that<00:01:14.760> your<00:01:14.939> stick<00:01:15.330> should

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
concept is is that your stick should

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.600 
concept is is that your stick should
actually<00:01:15.840> moving<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.350> somewhat<00:01:16.920> of<00:01:17.070> an<00:01:17.189> oval

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
actually moving in somewhat of an oval

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.300 
actually moving in somewhat of an oval
direction<00:01:18.479> coming<00:01:19.229> backwards<00:01:19.830> K<00:01:20.040> so<00:01:20.100> these

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
direction coming backwards K so these

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:30.130 
direction coming backwards K so these
pictures<00:01:20.700> right<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:20.880> will<00:01:21.150> sort<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.390> explain

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.120 

right<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.200> hopefully<00:01:31.409> those<00:01:31.560> pictures<00:01:31.920> make

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
right so hopefully those pictures make

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.980 
right so hopefully those pictures make
this<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.520> little<00:01:33.030> bit<00:01:33.210> easier<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.509> understand

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
this a little bit easier to understand

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.420 
this a little bit easier to understand
I'm<00:01:34.320> gonna<00:01:34.470> play<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.710> really<00:01:34.950> loosely<00:01:35.220> right

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
I'm gonna play this really loosely right

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.560 
I'm gonna play this really loosely right
now<00:01:35.549> at<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.790> end<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.090> video<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:36.390> going<00:01:36.509> to

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
now at the end of the video I'm going to

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.700 
now at the end of the video I'm going to
go<00:01:36.659> through<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:36.960> these<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.170> kind<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.530> play

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
go through all these and kind of play

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:46.749 
go through all these and kind of play
them<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> little<00:01:39.030> more<00:01:39.180> extensively

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.710 

alright<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.820> second<00:01:48.149> technique<00:01:48.270> I<00:01:48.450> wanted<00:01:48.659> to

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
alright the second technique I wanted to

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.210 
alright the second technique I wanted to
show<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.869> guys<00:01:49.020> is<00:01:49.350> actually<00:01:49.500> something<00:01:49.890> that

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
show you guys is actually something that

in<00:02:12.720> 16th<00:02:13.110> note<00:02:13.260> triplets<00:02:13.290> we're<00:02:13.770> going<00:02:13.890> to

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
in 16th note triplets we're going to

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:27.620

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
one and that it's going to happen just

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.470

before<00:02:31.580> before<00:02:32.580> beat<00:02:32.790> 3<00:02:33.120> so<00:02:33.240> it's<00:02:33.330> going<00:02:33.420> to

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
before before beat 3 so it's going to

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.390
