 do you understand if in the 70's types of gas 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000

 facebook film 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.330
 interesting 

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.330
 just like 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.820

 at the end of the 70s 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.400
 and with an accent 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.400
 which I have to say initially 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:28.530
 lazy everyone 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.460

 instead valsenio 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.610
 I absolutely didn't tighten it 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.610
 face up this is a thing and me 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.240
 20 years 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.520
 you would have never expected the generational diluted success 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.510
 as I said previously absolutely not 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.750
 site access 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:17.169
 that I do this character 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.169
 never absolutely 

00:02:22.169 --> 00:02:25.169
 how was your first encounter with the character of lupine 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.369
 disputed 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:32.789
 a very simple encounter ancient if this cardboard 

00:02:32.789 --> 00:02:35.789
 Flanders if this character 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.319
 I saw it a few hours 

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:42.469
 sending death to the hills 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:43.619
 this year scarrone 

00:02:43.619 --> 00:02:47.839
 I liked the drawing I liked the character I liked the stories that 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:50.839
 at the time they were very pretty 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:56.140
 always confuse sexy app very garbatella the character was 

00:02:56.139 --> 00:02:57.609
 witty 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.609
 so 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:05.249
 I really dedicated myself completely to the character 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:15.539
 photo via wolf cartoon farmstead e 

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:17.709
 I must say that emo 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.709
 very interesting 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:27.609
 which ultimately is perhaps the design is also 

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.919
 the stories 

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:48.949
 text of roberto of the judge 100 

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:53.169
 in the sense 

00:03:53.169 --> 00:03:56.169
 person I like photos that you transfer 

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:05.149
 the altercents 

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:12.949
 licking laughter 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.779
 after how much of own roberto of the judge admitted in loop an 

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:21.609
 friday club 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.069
 too 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:24.809
 the a 

00:04:24.809 --> 00:04:27.080
 the desire to 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.979
 the desire to do something will 

00:04:29.979 --> 00:04:31.710
 to carry it forward 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.020
 and above all the law of jewelery in cigarettes 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.840
 how was the famous Italian characterization of lupain 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.160
 very casual 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.199
 all very simple is not that there were also 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.120
 survey 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:56.120
 ideas on how to take pictures 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:59.539
 dwarf making feathers 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:04.449
 I left remnants in my imagination and at one point I got things from 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:07.050
 sun &amp; lt 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.440
 the summer of the litter altea were nice and then they were carried on 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.440
 this band 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:17.979
 dubbing games 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:19.490
 in the various series 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.490
 well I must say that green does not pass 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.110
 but I have a vague memory of my own 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.599
 very specific fun 

00:05:29.599 --> 00:05:31.479
 what he looked for me 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.469
 Colleagues 

00:05:33.469 --> 00:05:36.479
 all kinds do this thing 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:38.809
 a context for 

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:41.379
 we had to have fun 

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:43.279
 winzip for farmville 

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:48.789
 and this I think we succeeded because everyone gave a lot of drawings 

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:51.789
 in this cost of a 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.150
 set the first class with after the third series 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.560
 I have to be honest 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.249
 I prefer the star 

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:04.249
 I love financial right now 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.499
 it's not like there are dots on pc 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:13.539
 perhaps a fact of pleasant memories is an excitement 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:17.259
 I and I would tell you that he was always there I find a lot 

00:06:23.999 --> 00:06:26.080
 horoscope horoscope 

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:30.370
 well enea and they said yara first set my favorite 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:33.370
 wild jake weber 

00:06:34.729 --> 00:06:37.009
 what the film has come to who you prefer 

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.289
 I believe we will film them as the nicest siskin in the castle of Cagliostro 

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:46.210
 is the only film e 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.210
 flat cost 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:55.379
 but another company 

00:06:55.379 --> 00:06:58.029
 I was not asked why 

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:00.399
 I did it then I saw it 

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.399
 which I find that 

00:07:08.909 --> 00:07:11.749
 and which is the most beautiful special 

00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:13.580
 Bacchereto 

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.580
 tokyo frais 

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:23.779
 there was a very nice thing about betraying the zenigata character 

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:27.529
 ah in this special agreement 

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:31.669
 usually 

00:07:31.669 --> 00:07:33.349
 blessed l 

00:07:33.349 --> 00:07:36.149

 entered south 

00:07:38.729 --> 00:07:40.680
 the artists 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.779
 who in this shining hotel instead 

00:07:44.419 --> 00:07:47.889
 I have a particular story I find that 

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:50.719
 it's an idea too 

00:07:50.719 --> 00:07:53.210
 quite new because 

00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:55.849
 we are little bit shifted there 

00:07:55.849 --> 00:07:58.849
