irresistible this art is so stop motion
is<00:01:01.899> basically<00:01:02.710> just<00:01:02.980> a<00:01:03.969> bunch<00:01:04.449> of<00:01:04.570> pictures

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
is basically just a bunch of pictures

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:07.590 
is basically just a bunch of pictures
played<00:01:05.890> really<00:01:06.220> fast<00:01:06.580> and<00:01:06.850> it<00:01:07.180> gives<00:01:07.420> the

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
played really fast and it gives the

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.039 
played really fast and it gives the

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:11.049 
illusion of movement so in my case I

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:16.980 
illusion of movement so in my case I
animate<00:01:11.890> at<00:01:12.159> 15<00:01:12.729> frames<00:01:12.939> per<00:01:13.119> second<00:01:13.630> so<00:01:15.990> for

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
animate at 15 frames per second so for

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.870 
animate at 15 frames per second so for
every<00:01:17.229> second<00:01:17.590> of<00:01:17.619> animation<00:01:18.159> there's<00:01:18.340> 15

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880 
every second of animation there's 15

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.649 
every second of animation there's 15
