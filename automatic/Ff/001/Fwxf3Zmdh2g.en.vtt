00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.320 

appreciated

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:05.330 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.400 

all<00:00:06.330> right<00:00:06.480> I've<00:00:06.660> already<00:00:06.899> got<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.140> drums

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
all right I've already got the drums

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.680 
all right I've already got the drums
sounding<00:00:08.040> pretty<00:00:08.250> good<00:00:08.610> but<00:00:09.210> we<00:00:09.360> can<00:00:09.540> make

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
sounding pretty good but we can make

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.509 
sounding pretty good but we can make
them<00:00:09.870> sound<00:00:10.139> better<00:00:10.440> we<00:00:10.830> can<00:00:10.950> make<00:00:11.010> them<00:00:11.280> sound

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
them sound better we can make them sound

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.749 
them sound better we can make them sound
cleaner<00:00:12.000> and<00:00:12.300> fuller<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:14.460> way<00:00:14.610> we're

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
cleaner and fuller and the way we're

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.580 
cleaner and fuller and the way we're
gonna<00:00:14.820> do<00:00:15.089> that<00:00:15.120> first<00:00:15.630> is<00:00:16.020> we're<00:00:16.199> gonna<00:00:16.289> cover

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
gonna do that first is we're gonna cover

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.179 
gonna do that first is we're gonna cover
something<00:00:17.130> called<00:00:17.340> compression<00:00:18.140> compression

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
something called compression compression

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.670 
something called compression compression
closes<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.430> gap<00:00:20.580> between<00:00:21.420> loud<00:00:21.960> sounds<00:00:22.529> and

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
closes the gap between loud sounds and

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.820 
closes the gap between loud sounds and
soft<00:00:22.949> sounds<00:00:23.400> it<00:00:23.699> reduces<00:00:24.480> dynamic<00:00:25.140> variation

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
soft sounds it reduces dynamic variation

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.400 
soft sounds it reduces dynamic variation
this<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.820> much<00:00:27.269> easier<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:27.930> do<00:00:28.109> in

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
this is much easier to do in

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.970 
this is much easier to do in
post-processing<00:00:29.869> if<00:00:30.869> you're<00:00:31.439> gonna<00:00:31.529> do<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:31.890> in

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
post-processing if you're gonna do it in

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.760 
post-processing if you're gonna do it in
pre<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.610> pre-processing<00:00:33.440> you're<00:00:34.440> gonna<00:00:34.530> need

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
pre and pre-processing you're gonna need

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.500 
pre and pre-processing you're gonna need
some<00:00:35.010> really<00:00:35.399> expensive<00:00:35.550> equipment<00:00:35.910> that<00:00:36.480> I

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
some really expensive equipment that I

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.700 
some really expensive equipment that I
don't<00:00:36.960> have<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:38.629> as<00:00:39.629> far<00:00:40.020> as<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.260> know<00:00:40.320> there

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
don't have and as far as I know there

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.799 
don't have and as far as I know there
are<00:00:40.800> no<00:00:40.950> mixers<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.489> do<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.969> there<00:00:42.149> may<00:00:42.329> be<00:00:42.360> a

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
are no mixers that do it there may be a

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.229 
are no mixers that do it there may be a
high-end<00:00:43.260> mixer<00:00:43.440> somewhere<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.250> does<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:44.940> on

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
high-end mixer somewhere that does it on

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.020 
high-end mixer somewhere that does it on
individual<00:00:45.780> tracks<00:00:46.160> but<00:00:47.160> your<00:00:47.280> basic<00:00:47.460> mixers

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
individual tracks but your basic mixers

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:57.700 
individual tracks but your basic mixers
won't<00:00:48.510> do<00:00:48.809> compression

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.200 

most<00:00:58.710> important<00:00:59.309> things<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.730> need<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.059> know

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
most important things you need to know

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:07.870 
most important things you need to know
about<00:01:00.510> compression<00:01:01.079> are<00:01:01.530> threshold<00:01:03.890> ratio

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:18.830 

makeup<00:01:08.880> gain<00:01:12.140> attack<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:15.290> release<00:01:17.630> now<00:01:18.630> for

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
makeup gain attack and release now for

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.810 
makeup gain attack and release now for
this<00:01:18.960> example<00:01:19.350> we'll<00:01:19.710> draw<00:01:19.920> what<00:01:20.159> a<00:01:20.190> drum<00:01:20.520> hit

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
this example we'll draw what a drum hit

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.320 
this example we'll draw what a drum hit
looks<00:01:21.330> like<00:01:21.600> in<00:01:21.869> sound<00:01:22.200> waveform<00:01:23.149> you've<00:01:24.149> got

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
looks like in sound waveform you've got

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.060 
looks like in sound waveform you've got
your<00:01:24.509> attack<00:01:24.810> of<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.229> drum<00:01:25.470> that's<00:01:25.740> really

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
your attack of the drum that's really

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.660 
your attack of the drum that's really
loud<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.640> then<00:01:26.729> it'll<00:01:26.970> decay<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.630> quickly

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
loud and then it'll decay very quickly

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.910 
loud and then it'll decay very quickly
now<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.539> threshold<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.289> the<00:01:31.440> point<00:01:31.679> around

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
now the threshold is the point around

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.609 
now the threshold is the point around
which<00:01:32.220> compression<00:01:33.090> takes<00:01:33.330> place<00:01:33.530> we<00:01:34.530> don't

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
which compression takes place we don't

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.859 
which compression takes place we don't
want<00:01:34.800> to<00:01:34.890> set<00:01:35.070> our<00:01:35.220> threshold<00:01:35.250> too<00:01:36.030> high<00:01:36.330> or<00:01:36.690> we

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
want to set our threshold too high or we

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.080 
want to set our threshold too high or we
won't<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.649> won't<00:01:37.890> affect<00:01:38.250> anything<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:38.970> too

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
won't it won't affect anything and too

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.700 
won't it won't affect anything and too
low<00:01:39.270> it'll<00:01:39.570> squash<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.050> sound<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.470> drum

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
low it'll squash the sound of the drum

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.490 
low it'll squash the sound of the drum
so<00:01:41.490> for<00:01:42.119> this<00:01:42.240> example<00:01:42.569> we'll<00:01:42.840> put<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.259> about

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
so for this example we'll put it about

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.200 
so for this example we'll put it about
right<00:01:43.679> here<00:01:45.289> now<00:01:46.289> these<00:01:47.130> lines<00:01:47.429> represent<00:01:48.090> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
right here now these lines represent the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.180 
right here now these lines represent the
threshold<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.990> all<00:01:49.319> the<00:01:49.440> signal<00:01:49.800> that<00:01:49.920> falls

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:50.190 
threshold and all the signal that falls

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.919 
threshold and all the signal that falls
outside<00:01:50.429> of<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.850> lines<00:01:51.090> is<00:01:51.360> going<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.780> be

00:01:51.919 --> 00:01:51.929 
outside of the lines is going to be

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:54.410 
outside of the lines is going to be
crushed<00:01:52.259> down<00:01:52.560> into<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.729> lines<00:01:53.940> so<00:01:54.270> this

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
crushed down into the lines so this

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.200 
crushed down into the lines so this
makes<00:01:54.659> your<00:01:54.869> sound<00:01:55.050> softer<00:01:55.679> but<00:01:56.670> now<00:01:56.850> we're

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
makes your sound softer but now we're

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.270 
makes your sound softer but now we're
the<00:01:57.330> attack<00:01:57.690> of<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.020> original<00:01:58.619> sound<00:01:58.920> was

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
the attack of the original sound was

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.660 
the attack of the original sound was
very<00:01:59.340> short<00:02:00.560> the<00:02:01.560> attack<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.100> drum<00:02:02.399> sound

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
very short the attack of the drum sound

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.410 
very short the attack of the drum sound
is<00:02:02.850> going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> lot<00:02:03.570> longer<00:02:03.840> and<00:02:04.320> thicker

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
is going to be a lot longer and thicker

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.969 
is going to be a lot longer and thicker
now<00:02:06.420> with<00:02:06.570> ratio<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.380> is<00:02:07.590> how<00:02:07.770> much

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
now with ratio this is how much

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.340 
now with ratio this is how much
compression<00:02:08.579> takes<00:02:08.790> place<00:02:08.880> outside<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:10.290> the

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
compression takes place outside of the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.979 
compression takes place outside of the
threshold<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:10.920> a<00:02:11.070> four<00:02:11.280> to<00:02:11.400> one<00:02:11.519> ratio<00:02:11.989> for

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
threshold so a four to one ratio for

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.750 
threshold so a four to one ratio for
every<00:02:13.200> four<00:02:13.440> decibels<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.070> you<00:02:14.250> go<00:02:14.370> outside

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
every four decibels that you go outside

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.370 
every four decibels that you go outside
of<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.030> threshold<00:02:15.540> it's<00:02:15.810> only<00:02:15.989> going<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.260> show

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
of the threshold it's only going to show

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.039 
of the threshold it's only going to show
one<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:17.370> four<00:02:17.579> like<00:02:17.700> a<00:02:17.730> ten<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.180> one<00:02:18.360> ratio<00:02:18.390> or

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
one and four like a ten to one ratio or

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:21.319 
one and four like a ten to one ratio or
a<00:02:19.079> hundred<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.560> one<00:02:19.709> ratio<00:02:20.130> it'd<00:02:20.760> be<00:02:20.970> so<00:02:21.299> much

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:21.329 
a hundred to one ratio it'd be so much

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.150 
a hundred to one ratio it'd be so much
that<00:02:21.810> you're<00:02:21.930> squashing<00:02:22.230> down<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.739> signal

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
that you're squashing down the signal

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.009 
that you're squashing down the signal
and<00:02:23.400> it<00:02:23.519> would<00:02:23.610> completely<00:02:24.120> distort<00:02:24.600> it<00:02:24.720> so

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
and it would completely distort it so

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.080 
and it would completely distort it so
you<00:02:25.079> don't<00:02:25.290> want<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.530> go<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:26.100> numbers<00:02:26.459> that<00:02:26.910> are

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
you don't want to go to numbers that are

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.470 
you don't want to go to numbers that are
that<00:02:27.209> high<00:02:28.400> so<00:02:29.400> now<00:02:29.519> we've<00:02:29.700> got<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:30.120> signal

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
that high so now we've got the signal

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.290 
that high so now we've got the signal
over<00:02:30.690> here

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.910 

and<00:02:35.780> we're<00:02:35.930> gonna<00:02:36.020> go<00:02:36.230> to<00:02:36.290> make<00:02:36.530> up<00:02:36.560> gain

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
and we're gonna go to make up gain

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.220 
and we're gonna go to make up gain
basically<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.970> just<00:02:38.000> a<00:02:38.300> volume<00:02:38.570> knob

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
basically this is just a volume knob

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.840 
basically this is just a volume knob
now<00:02:39.440> that<00:02:39.680> we've<00:02:39.830> crushed<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.280> sound<00:02:40.520> down<00:02:40.730> in

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
now that we've crushed the sound down in

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.180 
now that we've crushed the sound down in
it's<00:02:41.000> quieter<00:02:41.420> we<00:02:41.600> want<00:02:41.780> to<00:02:41.900> expand<00:02:42.380> it<00:02:42.560> so

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:43.190 
it's quieter we want to expand it so

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.130 
it's quieter we want to expand it so
it's<00:02:43.340> just<00:02:43.490> as<00:02:43.700> a<00:02:43.730> left<00:02:44.060> it's<00:02:44.330> just<00:02:44.390> as<00:02:44.690> loud<00:02:44.930> as

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
it's just as a left it's just as loud as

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.100 
it's just as a left it's just as loud as
it<00:02:45.260> originally<00:02:45.740> was<00:02:45.820> so<00:02:46.820> now<00:02:46.970> your<00:02:47.210> signal<00:02:47.630> is

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:48.110 
it originally was so now your signal is

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:52.420 
it originally was so now your signal is
going<00:02:48.380> to<00:02:48.500> look<00:02:48.650> like<00:02:48.800> this<00:02:49.100> is<00:02:50.950> now<00:02:51.950> the<00:02:52.010> same

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
going to look like this is now the same

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.420 
going to look like this is now the same
loudness<00:02:53.380> but<00:02:54.380> the<00:02:54.500> loudness<00:02:54.710> lasts<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.310> little

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
loudness but the loudness lasts a little

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.670 
loudness but the loudness lasts a little
longer<00:02:55.580> so<00:02:56.180> now<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.750> attack<00:02:57.050> that<00:02:57.080> was<00:02:57.380> there

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
longer so now the attack that was there

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:04.080 
longer so now the attack that was there
is<00:02:58.000> now<00:02:59.000> here<00:03:01.450> now<00:03:02.450> attack<00:03:03.230> and<00:03:03.530> release

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
is now here now attack and release

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.940 
is now here now attack and release
relative<00:03:05.090> to<00:03:05.420> compression<00:03:06.080> are<00:03:06.680> just

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
relative to compression are just

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.440 
relative to compression are just
numerical<00:03:07.580> parameters<00:03:08.650> that<00:03:09.650> dictate<00:03:10.220> how

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
numerical parameters that dictate how

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.110 
numerical parameters that dictate how
compression<00:03:11.450> operates<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:13.700> here<00:03:13.910> if<00:03:13.970> we've

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
compression operates so here if we've

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.620 
compression operates so here if we've
got<00:03:14.270> our<00:03:14.390> threshold<00:03:14.900> right<00:03:15.170> here<00:03:16.300> the<00:03:17.300> attack

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
got our threshold right here the attack

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.750 
got our threshold right here the attack
is<00:03:17.840> the<00:03:17.990> amount<00:03:18.260> of<00:03:18.380> time<00:03:18.620> after<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.250> signal

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
is the amount of time after the signal

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.340 
is the amount of time after the signal
crosses<00:03:19.910> the<00:03:20.270> threshold<00:03:20.420> that<00:03:20.930> compression

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:21.350 
crosses the threshold that compression

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.680 
crosses the threshold that compression
starts<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:22.880> we'll<00:03:23.000> put<00:03:23.180> attack<00:03:23.450> right<00:03:23.630> here

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
starts so we'll put attack right here

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.960 
starts so we'll put attack right here
and<00:03:24.140> release<00:03:24.470> is<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.160> amount<00:03:25.370> of<00:03:25.460> time<00:03:25.700> after

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
and release is the amount of time after

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.100 
and release is the amount of time after
attack<00:03:27.430> that<00:03:28.430> compression<00:03:28.850> takes<00:03:29.240> place<00:03:29.330> so

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
attack that compression takes place so

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.890 
attack that compression takes place so
if<00:03:30.230> the<00:03:30.350> release<00:03:30.650> is<00:03:30.890> here<00:03:31.690> compression<00:03:32.690> is

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
if the release is here compression is

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.560 
if the release is here compression is
going<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.290> compress<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.890> signal<00:03:34.100> in<00:03:34.640> this

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.570 
going to compress the signal in this

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:40.240 
going to compress the signal in this
area<00:03:36.310> but<00:03:37.310> not<00:03:37.460> after<00:03:38.410> so<00:03:39.410> this<00:03:39.620> section<00:03:39.890> right

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
area but not after so this section right

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.240 
area but not after so this section right
here<00:03:40.280> will<00:03:40.820> actually<00:03:41.030> be<00:03:41.450> identical<00:03:42.140> to<00:03:43.100> the

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
here will actually be identical to the

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.460 
here will actually be identical to the
original<00:03:43.370> section<00:03:44.209> up<00:03:44.360> here<00:03:44.690> because<00:03:45.170> it<00:03:45.440> is

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
original section up here because it is

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:55.330 
original section up here because it is
not<00:03:45.590> being<00:03:46.040> compressed

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.910

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
too much compression lemonade's dynamics

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.709 
too much compression lemonade's dynamics
for<00:03:59.909> example<00:04:00.829> you<00:04:01.829> can<00:04:02.280> look<00:04:02.459> at<00:04:02.640> sound<00:04:03.420> clips

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:03.719 
for example you can look at sound clips

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:05.750 
for example you can look at sound clips
from<00:04:03.870> two<00:04:04.109> of<00:04:04.379> my<00:04:04.530> favorite<00:04:04.920> bands<00:04:05.129> porcupine

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.449 
tree and skillet you can see the skillet
has<00:04:09.959> been<00:04:10.170> compressed<00:04:10.620> so<00:04:10.859> much<00:04:11.069> that<00:04:11.340> the

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
has been compressed so much that the

has been compressed so much that the
sound<00:04:11.760> waves<00:04:12.000> are<00:04:12.180> almost<00:04:12.480> just<00:04:12.629> a<00:04:12.900> big<00:04:13.140> wall

sometimes one song will get done playing
on<00:04:41.039> shuffle<00:04:41.310> and<00:04:41.610> another<00:04:41.940> one<00:04:42.120> will<00:04:42.210> come<00:04:42.240> up

on shuffle and another one will come up

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:44.779 
on shuffle and another one will come up
and<00:04:42.690> it'll<00:04:42.810> be<00:04:42.960> just<00:04:42.990> a<00:04:43.380> ton<00:04:43.650> louder<00:04:43.979> it's

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789

actually<00:04:45.270> probably<00:04:45.810> not<00:04:46.050> louder<00:04:46.710> it's<00:04:47.070> just

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
actually probably not louder it's just

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.430 
actually probably not louder it's just
louder<00:04:47.639> for<00:04:48.150> a<00:04:48.180> more<00:04:48.449> extended<00:04:48.870> period<00:04:49.380> of

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
louder for a more extended period of

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.460 
louder for a more extended period of
time<00:04:49.500> and<00:04:49.710> it<00:04:50.280> seems<00:04:51.000> like<00:04:51.960> it<00:04:52.110> is<00:04:52.199> a<00:04:52.229> lot

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
time and it seems like it is a lot

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.950 
time and it seems like it is a lot
louder<00:04:52.759> this<00:04:53.759> is<00:04:53.970> also<00:04:54.120> the<00:04:54.389> same<00:04:54.570> reason<00:04:54.599> that

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
louder this is also the same reason that

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.870 
louder this is also the same reason that
we're<00:04:55.139> watching<00:04:55.380> a<00:04:55.620> TV<00:04:55.800> show<00:04:56.160> and<00:04:56.699> the

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
we're watching a TV show and the

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.730 
we're watching a TV show and the
commercial<00:04:57.330> a<00:04:57.360> commercial<00:04:58.139> comes<00:04:58.349> on<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.680> it

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
commercial a commercial comes on and it

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.050 
commercial a commercial comes on and it
just<00:04:58.919> blasts<00:04:59.370> you<00:04:59.490> it's<00:04:59.669> because<00:04:59.940> the

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
just blasts you it's because the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.089 
just blasts you it's because the
commercial<00:05:00.449> has<00:05:00.570> been<00:05:00.720> compressed<00:05:01.229> a<00:05:01.590> lot

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
commercial has been compressed a lot

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:04.310 
commercial has been compressed a lot
more<00:05:02.370> and<00:05:02.699> then<00:05:03.270> there's<00:05:03.750> been<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:03.990> lot<00:05:04.169> more

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
more and then there's been a lot more

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.040 
more and then there's been a lot more
gain<00:05:04.650> added<00:05:05.190> to<00:05:05.340> it<00:05:05.520> so<00:05:05.760> it's<00:05:05.970> a<00:05:06.090> bigger<00:05:06.599> wall

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
gain added to it so it's a bigger wall

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.659 
gain added to it so it's a bigger wall
of<00:05:07.349> sound<00:05:07.590> basically<00:05:09.199> compression<00:05:10.199> is<00:05:10.669> most

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
of sound basically compression is most

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:15.159 
of sound basically compression is most
used<00:05:12.090> on<00:05:12.510> snare<00:05:13.289> drums<00:05:13.650> and<00:05:14.070> your<00:05:14.729> bass<00:05:14.880> drum

00:05:15.159 --> 00:05:15.169 
used on snare drums and your bass drum

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:19.070 
used on snare drums and your bass drum
this<00:05:16.169> is<00:05:16.380> used<00:05:16.590> for<00:05:16.889> solidity<00:05:17.510> you<00:05:18.510> get<00:05:18.720> a<00:05:18.750> much

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
this is used for solidity you get a much

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:24.290 
this is used for solidity you get a much
a<00:05:20.210> much<00:05:21.210> less<00:05:21.990> variation<00:05:22.740> in<00:05:22.919> your<00:05:23.099> snare<00:05:23.460> hits

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:24.300 
a much less variation in your snare hits

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.149 
a much less variation in your snare hits
and<00:05:24.690> your<00:05:24.930> bass<00:05:25.080> drum<00:05:25.349> hits<00:05:25.500> but<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:25.800> like<00:05:26.010> to

and your bass drum hits but I like to

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:28.159 
and your bass drum hits but I like to

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:28.169 
use it in toms too because it can help

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:32.000 
use it in toms too because it can help

matam<00:05:55.300> mics<00:05:55.570> now<00:05:56.440> I<00:05:56.470> have<00:05:57.070> to<00:05:57.250> apply<00:05:57.639> a<00:05:57.669> lot<00:05:58.240> of

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
matam mics now I have to apply a lot of

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:01.290 
matam mics now I have to apply a lot of
makeup<00:05:58.690> gain<00:05:59.110> for<00:06:00.010> my<00:06:00.100> Tom<00:06:00.370> mics<00:06:00.639> because<00:06:00.910> as

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:01.300 
makeup gain for my Tom mics because as

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:05.730 
makeup gain for my Tom mics because as
you<00:06:01.660> recall<00:06:01.900> in<00:06:02.410> the<00:06:02.590> EQ<00:06:03.010> section<00:06:03.449> I<00:06:04.740> showed

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:05.740 
you recall in the EQ section I showed

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.180 
you recall in the EQ section I showed
you<00:06:05.979> that<00:06:06.280> I've<00:06:06.580> reduced<00:06:07.000> the<00:06:07.360> mids<00:06:07.660> a<00:06:08.050> lot<00:06:08.830> and

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.190 
you that I've reduced the mids a lot and

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:11.159 
you that I've reduced the mids a lot and
I<00:06:09.310> just<00:06:09.580> keep<00:06:09.820> the<00:06:10.150> low<00:06:10.330> end<00:06:10.600> and<00:06:10.810> the<00:06:10.870> high<00:06:10.960> end

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:11.169 
I just keep the low end and the high end

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.469 
I just keep the low end and the high end
well<00:06:11.979> when<00:06:12.100> you<00:06:12.220> reduce<00:06:12.490> the<00:06:12.729> mids<00:06:12.970> it

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
well when you reduce the mids it

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:15.719 
well when you reduce the mids it
actually<00:06:14.020> reduces<00:06:14.650> the<00:06:14.680> volume<00:06:15.040> of<00:06:15.430> the<00:06:15.580> track

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
actually reduces the volume of the track

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.000 
actually reduces the volume of the track
so<00:06:16.090> I<00:06:16.120> need<00:06:16.419> to<00:06:16.510> put<00:06:16.690> a<00:06:16.720> lot<00:06:16.990> of<00:06:17.200> makeup<00:06:17.410> gain<00:06:17.800> in

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
so I need to put a lot of makeup gain in

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.060 
so I need to put a lot of makeup gain in
there<00:06:18.360> and<00:06:19.360> boost<00:06:19.660> the<00:06:19.930> volume<00:06:20.110> of<00:06:20.530> that<00:06:20.560> so

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:21.070 
there and boost the volume of that so

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:22.860 
there and boost the volume of that so
it'll<00:06:21.370> match<00:06:21.639> with<00:06:22.120> the<00:06:22.240> rest<00:06:22.419> of<00:06:22.570> the<00:06:22.660> drum

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:22.870 
it'll match with the rest of the drum

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:23.159 
it'll match with the rest of the drum
set

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
set

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:26.040 
set
as<00:06:23.830> far<00:06:24.190> as<00:06:24.220> overhead<00:06:24.700> mics<00:06:25.120> you<00:06:25.570> can<00:06:25.750> compress

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
as far as overhead mics you can compress

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:28.650 
as far as overhead mics you can compress
them<00:06:26.410> but<00:06:26.740> I<00:06:26.770> prefer<00:06:27.190> not<00:06:27.220> to<00:06:27.460> because<00:06:28.450> I<00:06:28.600> think

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660 
them but I prefer not to because I think

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:32.790 
them but I prefer not to because I think
overhead<00:06:29.290> mics<00:06:30.270> generally<00:06:31.270> get<00:06:31.450> a<00:06:31.479> good<00:06:31.840> image

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
overhead mics generally get a good image

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:35.159 
overhead mics generally get a good image
of<00:06:33.039> how<00:06:33.220> the<00:06:33.280> whole<00:06:33.700> drum<00:06:34.060> sound<00:06:34.419> should<00:06:34.990> be

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:35.169 
of how the whole drum sound should be

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:38.159 
of how the whole drum sound should be
and<00:06:35.550> you<00:06:36.550> you<00:06:36.820> get<00:06:37.000> more<00:06:37.060> dynamics<00:06:37.810> that<00:06:38.050> way

00:06:38.159 --> 00:06:38.169 
and you you get more dynamics that way

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:40.680 
and you you get more dynamics that way
and<00:06:38.410> you<00:06:38.560> need<00:06:39.100> to<00:06:39.280> have<00:06:39.430> dynamics<00:06:40.090> to<00:06:40.270> make<00:06:40.449> a

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:40.690 
and you need to have dynamics to make a

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.850 
and you need to have dynamics to make a
song<00:06:40.960> or<00:06:41.620> whatever<00:06:41.919> you're<00:06:42.190> playing<00:06:43.710> sound<00:06:44.710> a

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:44.860 
song or whatever you're playing sound a

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.260 
song or whatever you're playing sound a
lot<00:06:45.010> more<00:06:45.070> lively<00:06:45.760> and<00:06:45.789> a<00:06:45.940> lot<00:06:46.090> more

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:46.270 
lot more lively and a lot more

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:48.840 
lot more lively and a lot more
interesting
