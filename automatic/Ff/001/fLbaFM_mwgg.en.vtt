00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.420
 Hi, I'm marcelina and today I 'm going to 

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:21.860
 show how I did to make these candles 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.600
 that it looks like someone had drawn 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.460
 about them and that they are also a 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.850
 excellent idea to give on the day of 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.850
 the mother 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:35.160
 the materials we need are candles 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.160
 white in different sizes 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.680
 markers or markers norm 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.690
 a common hair dryer 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:57.039
 sticky tape tape measure a pedant 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.039
 in bar scissors and pencil 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.250
 finally we are going to need paper be 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.180
 white and butter paper from which 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.180
 We use to cook 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.630
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.789
 measure the candles to know how much 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.009
 space we count to draw we have 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.850
 to measure the height of the candle and also 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.850
 its circumference 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.110
 as the paper is so delicate is 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.850
 good idea to secure it to the surface of 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.409
 I work for the children after 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.319
 can draw comfortably 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:39.420
 Now we use the measurements of the sail for 

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:39.420
 mark the area where we are going to draw 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.820
 this technique works very well with 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.550
 markers but can also be used 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.550
 colored pencils and even paints 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.210
 and 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.550
 once we have the drawings them 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.140
 we apply glue on both ends 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:00.599
 simply to secure the paper to the 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.110
 candle without moving but only in the 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.110
 extremes 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.860
 Now let's wrap the candle in a 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:28.750
 piece of paper butter on pieces of 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.400
 paper has to be much bigger than 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.290
 the candle so that we have a kind 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.690
 of marsh so we can sustain the 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.130
 candle without burning when applying 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.130
 heat with hair dryer 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.530
 the heat that we are going to apply with the 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.960
 Hair dryer helps the paper 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:58.900
 Silk is melted with candle wax and 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:01.630
 it looks like it was drawn directly 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.940
 about sailing this process takes several 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.120
 minutes you have to have patience and there are 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.040
 have to move the sail to make sure 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.240
 that the part where we had the handle 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.240
 also receive heat 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.479
 the end result is a very gift 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.690
 fun for example this candle I made it 

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:31.530
 with the scribbles of my little daughter 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.270
 I hope you are encouraged to do this 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:35.639
 project and show them on the networks 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.650
 social how they stayed do not forget 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.180
 visit dotcom standard art to know 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.370
 more about the products with which 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.820
 we carry out this project until the 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.820
 next
