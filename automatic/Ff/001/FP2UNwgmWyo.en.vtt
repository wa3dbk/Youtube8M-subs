00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
outside or whatever he didn't and as I

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.150 
outside or whatever he didn't and as I
did<00:00:59.230> that<00:00:59.260> I<00:00:59.860> saw<00:01:00.820> a<00:01:01.059> glow<00:01:01.600> we<00:01:02.230> have<00:01:02.440> sky<00:01:02.860> lights

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
did that I saw a glow we have sky lights

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.459 
did that I saw a glow we have sky lights
up<00:01:03.430> above<00:01:03.820> this<00:01:04.180> great<00:01:04.600> room<00:01:04.930> in<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.229> center

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:05.469 
up above this great room in the center

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:09.020 
up above this great room in the center
of<00:01:05.680> the<00:01:05.770> house<00:01:06.479> it's<00:01:07.479> a<00:01:07.659> two<00:01:07.869> storey<00:01:08.229> room<00:01:08.619> and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
of the house it's a two storey room and

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.660 
of the house it's a two storey room and
I<00:01:10.030> saw<00:01:10.299> a<00:01:10.479> glow<00:01:10.929> that<00:01:10.959> I<00:01:11.350> knew<00:01:11.709> didn't<00:01:12.219> belong

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
I saw a glow that I knew didn't belong

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.309 
I saw a glow that I knew didn't belong
there

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:13.319 
there

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:16.559 
there
so<00:01:14.319> I<00:01:14.350> watched<00:01:14.770> it<00:01:15.069> for<00:01:15.280> just<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:15.609> few<00:01:15.969> seconds

00:01:16.559 --> 00:01:16.569 
so I watched it for just a few seconds

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:21.419 
so I watched it for just a few seconds
and<00:01:17.939> determined<00:01:18.939> I've<00:01:19.090> never<00:01:19.539> been<00:01:20.219> around<00:01:21.219> a

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
and determined I've never been around a

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:26.639 
and determined I've never been around a
fire<00:01:21.609> before<00:01:22.119> ever<00:01:22.420> and<00:01:23.069> so<00:01:24.069> I<00:01:25.649> determined

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
fire before ever and so I determined

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.099 
fire before ever and so I determined
that<00:01:27.159> it<00:01:27.310> was<00:01:27.520> fire<00:01:27.880> because<00:01:28.509> it<00:01:28.659> started

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:29.109 
that it was fire because it started

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:31.679 
that it was fire because it started
moving<00:01:29.350> and<00:01:29.859> just<00:01:30.459> I<00:01:30.700> could<00:01:30.939> see<00:01:31.179> the<00:01:31.359> glow

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
moving and just I could see the glow

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.370 
moving and just I could see the glow
jumping<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:33.179> then<00:01:34.179> I<00:01:34.209> started<00:01:34.810> hearing<00:01:35.020> some

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
jumping and then I started hearing some

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.219 
jumping and then I started hearing some
popping<00:01:35.759> so<00:01:36.759> I<00:01:36.789> ran<00:01:37.209> back<00:01:37.479> to<00:01:37.509> the<00:01:37.689> bedroom<00:01:37.959> I
