00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.539
 in the orchestra from my side 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:13.909
 the benefit is that we probably will not be researchers anymore 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:15.929
 have to be this year already 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.929
 and scanners even more remotely 

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:22.050
 who is warmer more Munich 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.689
 with blue light percent 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.149
 in the negative sense of course 

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.339
 SID delivered a game that of course nice 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.609
 The task has to be "We have to take along in the current season 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.410
 and my job is as possible this week 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.940
 to have many conversations pm 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.150
 many things 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.020
 in the right direction that we can try 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.050
 around 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.970
 To find that again what distinguishes this team can cheer 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:51.870
 these 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.720
 can play attractive football 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.160
 and we want to try that, of course, also possible to quickly rank up again 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.550
 To bring the place because we are received with Cologne mm very good intent 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.430
 at the moment and woe 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.280
 and of course now all our strength would be and in the area and we have to 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.560
 a moment to say succinct we want that and there is one too 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.200
 chance 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.300
 that always so that percent "If my situation 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.630
 special but special situation that you have to try in the end 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 to act wisely and that's what we want to do 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.850
 But I'm sure that will be interesting as the week progresses though 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.010
 Naturally 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.430
 mm in the team 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.790
 to attempt 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.940
 Why 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.500
 Thinking alike to do the same thing means the main task 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.970
 that we have this week 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.970
 his head is that South Africa 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.990
 concrete goals 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.260
 Being successful at playing football is about winning every game 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.690
 but luck believe that can be bad advice if we have this now 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.720
 spend common goals again we start why why that's it 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:00.640
 First of all, we want to show the transfer on Saturday alone a reaction 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.160
 That was the first step 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.270
 they basically point to this 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.270
 only six bankruptcies as a team 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.069
 Messenger so Michels hope to sit and now lie forward 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:12.849
 suddenly surpass everything
