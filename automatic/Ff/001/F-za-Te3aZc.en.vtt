00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.730
 until now 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.430
 and I discovered 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:15.570
 that cardiovascular exercise that 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:15.570
 I tried courage 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.869
 It is the best 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:25.520
 the bike 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.600
 it's very good in fact it follows 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.600
 of importance 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:36.520
 also hydration 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.100
 especially 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.380
 swimming as it should be formal 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.100
 doing km 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.560
 it's very very good , but there's nothing 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.870
 how to run the growing impact on 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.699
 muscles 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:57.239
 the force that makes the attention that 

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.239
 Exercises in each fall of each stride 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.640
 besides 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.990
 in addition to what it provides 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.980
 because cardiovascular is the one 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.940
 burns abdomen fat 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:15.700
 is the one that feeds 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.400
 after 30 minutes of exercise 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.830
 constant 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.680
 the body begins to take it from there but 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.409
 besides that is something 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.260
 this arm movement 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:30.890
 A) Yes 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:35.480
 that your chest decreases of fat that the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.940
 biceps and shoulder exercise 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.160
 get strong and start this 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.130
 Baking helps you to pick up the skin 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.580
 when you lose weight so you do not have 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.580
 strung up 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.250
 do not say your legs 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:54.820
 that all the tendons and muscles are 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.820
 working 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.260
 the exercise is tremendous 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:07.560
 there are many people who want to run 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.560
 but he says is that they do not have 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.160
 It is interrupting me while 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.160
 listen 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.180
 very well 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.180
 3 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.250
 in 3 km 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.120
 300 calories per hour 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.830
 it took a great speed 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.069
 it's precisely something that takes a lot 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.840
 people who say 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:45.180
 I'm going to start walking 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:48.650
 until you are ready to eat 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.650
 but to run he prepares 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:03:05.900
 one can prepare only by running 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:07.850
 or walking you can even say it but 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.050
 when you start running is when 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.050
 just started 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.100
 we are being persecuted 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:22.210
 those 93 a year away 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.780
 I certainly take care of my diet but I do not 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.780
 too 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:41.720
 because they forbade me to run they told me 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.850
 that I was going to hurt my knees and that 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:51.620
 the long one almost would almost stay 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:53.660
 invalid they painted me a panorama without 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.730
 However I saw many obese 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.550
 lose weight in three months 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:04.010
 and they put the scrubs incredibly 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:08.170
 older than I put myself so 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.410
 I decided and just 

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.850
 I started running 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.720
 says run 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:20.320
 I was running 4 kilometers an hour, people 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.600
 it goes on walking but I was doing 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.500
 the stride was making people restless 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.330
 slowly 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.759
 I never knew when 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.270
 but now my speed of 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:38.180
 recovery is this recovery is 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:40.580
 of 9 km when I start to run hard 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.939
 intense 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:47.180
 reached 314 km that is not a 

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:49.820
 wonder but for me 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:53.820
 I feel like I reach the stream 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.940
 I feel that my body returned 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.569
 that I remove more or less between 10 and 15 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.529
 years 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:03.089
 because 10 and 15 years ago 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:05.539
 it seems to me that I could not even do 

00:05:03.089 --> 00:05:05.539
 what now 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:13.270
 I turned the clock a little 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.960
 it could be like a miracle 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:20.889
 I could say it 's a miracle but that 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.680
 miracle is an ordinary miracle 

00:05:20.889 --> 00:05:28.050
 a miracle that God puts us to 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.050
 that we harvest them the only thing 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.789
 random 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:55.060
 poor you can not 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:55.060
 that they see you strange when you run 10 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.030
 excuses
