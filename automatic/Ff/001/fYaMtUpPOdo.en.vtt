00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.870
 hey people what is fix workshop shop 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.750
 video and today I have a new one 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.100
 so that the goldfish 1.24 without 1.26 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.109
 for you because the series is for all 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.090
 consoles and also for the pc 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.340
 the only thing he needs it for 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.990
 garage this must be full if you 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.490
 three garages already owns there 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.590
 all three garages be full 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.679
 my tip is buy either leds 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.600
 or karin levels that's what you can do 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.030
 then at the karen maples also the five 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.649
 minutes of waiting time and then leaves 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.719
 her just some garage in and out 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.730
 drive a vehicle out what you stop 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.070
 no longer needed you can stop then 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.260
 in elegy then rattle you take 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.120
 have bought before now comes yours 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.640
 friend in the game is now recovering one 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.960
 cargo simply takes the car that you 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.030
 just went out to the bottom 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.860
 hook it 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.750
 Now you go back to the street resp 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.699
 what has brought he goes to the street 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.559
 and is looking for some vehicle from 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.539
 a npc I recommend you in course 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.129
 to take buffalo or band factor 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.000
 black because you can ask this question 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.200
 vehicles 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.670
 therefore sell and stop all the more 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.990
 tour comes in the vehicles so 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.330
 Of course, we will get more later as well 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.869
 that's why it's best to take a weapon 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.000
 logan it or keep normal buffalo 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.380
 and father with us should customs world 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.750
 arrived then you have to dare 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.310
 really on course if not enough 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.659
 You could just have money 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.490
 sell a garage 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.689
 then you just need two garages 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.430
 just imagine or sell 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.470
 any vehicle because he gets it 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.450
 also rather more money out and you can 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.820
 then buy a lot of vehicles 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.070
 as I said june fully on and if dare 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.990
 you did that then you go 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.750
 to 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.270
 Protection and insurance or theft 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:48.829
 and loss and he bought the locator beacon 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.720
 and if you now the tracking 

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.340
 buy there will be the message for you 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.259
 come replace a vehicle 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.390
 if that was the case, then 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.340
 just replaced any vehicle he did 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.960
 no longer needs as just said buy 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.929
 you start the kids stop at before 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.850
 any leds or karen rebell and 

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.049
 the vehicle replaces it now 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.789
 simply or content the 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.979
 message comes he keeps put either 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:11.209
 vehicle and then you can just get out 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.310
 drive and if you arrived outside 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.350
 Are you back in Lausanne the customs 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.540
 pure and now you go back under the 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.069
 point theft and loss and do that 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.830
 So again , then go up again 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:23.209
 tracking transmitter and when then again the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:24.590
 message come and then put it back 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.260
 any vehicles that could now 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.519
 quite often in a row and each 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:30.769
 if that makes it will be just this 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.260
 vehicle what he has accomplished in that has the 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.420
 because they have different customs 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.280
 Duplicate that again in your garage 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.769
 means you can then tons of the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.060
 Duplicate vehicles respectively 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.680
 it could be so on others 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.540
 make garages or 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.940
 if yes have three garages and there stop 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.489
 Everywhere LEDs could stand in it 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.019
 Doubling 30 vehicles and stopping in 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.790
 really very short time and if he is 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:54.049
 stop then enough vehicles doubled 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.510
 I 'll just ask you from Lausanne 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:58.489
 tas customs out and vehicles garage 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.840
 and drive in some garage on 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:01.549
 best hold only one place is free 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.709
 or where you still hold one 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.820
 another vehicle you what has not so 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.500
 he is not worth much 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.030
 have value loss and if you hold the 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.859
 Just now there must be yours 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.560
