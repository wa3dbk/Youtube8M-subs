based in Ghent itself we have several
campuses<00:02:25.170> this<00:02:26.070> is<00:02:26.310> quite<00:02:26.940> different

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
campuses this is quite different

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.270 
campuses this is quite different
compared<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.110> American<00:02:28.530> universities<00:02:29.100> I

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
compared to American universities I

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.220 
compared to American universities I
visited<00:02:29.700> quite<00:02:30.150> some<00:02:30.390> universities<00:02:30.930> already

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
visited quite some universities already

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.670 
visited quite some universities already
and<00:02:31.500> I<00:02:32.250> have<00:02:32.880> seen<00:02:33.090> some<00:02:33.300> campuses<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:34.410> most

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
and I have seen some campuses and most

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.200 
and I have seen some campuses and most
of<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.950> American<00:02:35.310> universities<00:02:35.760> have<00:02:35.940> one

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
of the American universities have one

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:38.450 
of the American universities have one
big<00:02:36.570> campus<00:02:37.080> and<00:02:37.380> I<00:02:37.440> always<00:02:37.590> compare<00:02:38.010> it<00:02:38.130> to<00:02:38.220> a

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
big campus and I always compare it to a

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.430 
big campus and I always compare it to a
small<00:02:38.850> village<00:02:39.090> because<00:02:39.630> basically<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.290> can

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
small village because basically you can

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.350 
small village because basically you can
do<00:02:40.560> everything<00:02:41.220> on<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.730> campus<00:02:42.060> you<00:02:42.180> can

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
do everything on the campus you can

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360 
do everything on the campus you can
study<00:02:42.840> there<00:02:43.140> you<00:02:43.320> could<00:02:43.470> work<00:02:43.680> there<00:02:43.950> you<00:02:43.980> can

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
study there you could work there you can

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.700 
study there you could work there you can
shop<00:02:44.550> there<00:02:44.820> you<00:02:44.910> can<00:02:45.060> support<00:02:45.360> there<00:02:45.660> this<00:02:46.470> is

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
shop there you can support there this is

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.220 
shop there you can support there this is
really<00:02:47.160> different<00:02:47.430> to<00:02:48.240> what<00:02:48.450> we<00:02:48.660> have<00:02:48.900> we<00:02:49.200> have

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
really different to what we have we have

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.260 
really different to what we have we have
a<00:02:49.410> very<00:02:49.710> big<00:02:49.890> institution<00:02:50.550> that's<00:02:50.760> true<00:02:51.000> but

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
a very big institution that's true but

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:54.290 
a very big institution that's true but

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
it's thread around the city so we have

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.720 
it's thread around the city so we have
our<00:02:54.600> faculty<00:02:55.290> of<00:02:55.410> music<00:02:55.830> which<00:02:55.950> is<00:02:56.130> based<00:02:56.430> in

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
our faculty of music which is based in

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.770 
our faculty of music which is based in
the<00:02:56.820> old<00:02:57.590> historical<00:02:58.590> center<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.270> Ghent<00:03:00.270> so

when you come out of the building you're

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.530 
when you come out of the building you're
