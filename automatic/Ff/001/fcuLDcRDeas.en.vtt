now<00:02:13.830> jump<00:02:14.070> to<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.280> back<00:02:14.430> of<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.610> unit<00:02:14.730> we<00:02:14.970> can

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
now jump to the back of the unit we can

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.120 
now jump to the back of the unit we can
see<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.510> we<00:02:15.600> have<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.750> camera<00:02:15.960> this<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:16.560> 5

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
see that we have a camera this is a 5

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.030 
see that we have a camera this is a 5
megapixel<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:18.240> is<00:02:18.420> an<00:02:18.570> auto<00:02:18.840> focus<00:02:19.410> on<00:02:19.590> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
megapixel this is an auto focus on the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.690 
megapixel this is an auto focus on the
front<00:02:20.340> we<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.910> a<00:02:21.440> 1.2<00:02:22.440> but<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.280> one<00:02:23.490> is

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
front we have a 1.2 but this one is

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.790 
front we have a 1.2 but this one is
fixed<00:02:24.360> focus<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:24.900> there's<00:02:25.080> not<00:02:25.200> much<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:25.440> can

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
fixed focus so there's not much you can

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.770 
fixed focus so there's not much you can
do<00:02:26.070> with<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.250> we<00:02:27.030> can<00:02:27.150> clearly<00:02:27.420> see<00:02:27.750> the

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
do with that we can clearly see the

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.810 
do with that we can clearly see the

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
screen is features that corning gorilla

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.820 
screen is features that corning gorilla
glass<00:02:30.030> it's<00:02:30.540> anti<00:02:30.900> scratch<00:02:31.140> resistant<00:02:31.770> and

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
glass it's anti scratch resistant and

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.320 
glass it's anti scratch resistant and
all<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:32.160> and<00:02:32.400> it's<00:02:32.910> actually<00:02:33.000> got<00:02:33.300> a

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
depending on how you want to view things

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.150 
depending on how you want to view things
I<00:04:32.480> actually<00:04:33.080> myself<00:04:33.380> find<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.890> little<00:04:34.070> bit

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:34.160 
I actually myself find a little bit

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.290 
I actually myself find a little bit
easier<00:04:34.460> to<00:04:34.490> view<00:04:34.670> things<00:04:34.850> when<00:04:35.060> it's<00:04:35.150> turned

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
easier to view things when it's turned

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.330 
easier to view things when it's turned
sideways<00:04:35.600> instead<00:04:35.930> of<00:04:36.140> portrait<00:04:36.620> but<00:04:36.800> that's

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
sideways instead of portrait but that's

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.460 
sideways instead of portrait but that's
a<00:04:37.490> matter<00:04:37.670> of<00:04:37.790> decision<00:04:38.240> so<00:04:38.930> there<00:04:39.230> you<00:04:39.440> have

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
a matter of decision so there you have

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.350 
a matter of decision so there you have
it<00:04:39.710> everything<00:04:40.190> that<00:04:40.310> comes<00:04:40.520> in<00:04:40.670> the<00:04:40.760> box<00:04:40.790> the

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:41.360 
it everything that comes in the box the

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.150 
it everything that comes in the box the
features<00:04:41.810> and<00:04:42.050> all<00:04:42.200> the<00:04:42.320> things<00:04:42.590> that<00:04:42.800> make<00:04:42.980> up

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160
