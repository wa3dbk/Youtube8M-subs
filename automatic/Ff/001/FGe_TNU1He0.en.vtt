to the honest hacia pomade

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.710 
to the honest hacia pomade
when<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.770> was<00:02:23.010> using<00:02:23.250> my<00:02:23.520> finger<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:23.970> swatch<00:02:24.450> a

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
when I was using my finger to swatch a

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.800 
when I was using my finger to swatch a
side-by-side<00:02:25.080> Mixel<00:02:26.040> anastacio<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.940> seemed<00:02:27.540> a

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
side-by-side Mixel anastacio it seemed a

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.440 
side-by-side Mixel anastacio it seemed a
little<00:02:28.050> bit<00:02:28.290> drier<00:02:28.800> for<00:02:29.430> me<00:02:29.580> to<00:02:29.700> pick<00:02:29.910> up<00:02:30.120> as

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
little bit drier for me to pick up as

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.810 
little bit drier for me to pick up as
the<00:02:30.480> pomade<00:02:31.170> is<00:02:31.320> a<00:02:31.350> little<00:02:31.650> bit<00:02:31.800> softer<00:02:32.580> in

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.600 
the pomade is a little bit softer in
texture<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:34.410> kept<00:02:34.740> having<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.190> rub<00:02:35.430> it

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
texture so I kept having to rub it

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:36.980 
texture so I kept having to rub it
because<00:02:35.940> I<00:02:36.150> felt<00:02:36.480> like<00:02:36.540> it<00:02:36.720> was<00:02:36.810> going<00:02:36.900> to

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
because I felt like it was going to

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:44.750 
because I felt like it was going to
swatch<00:02:37.440> patchy<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:43.500> I<00:02:43.530> really<00:02:44.070> like<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.400> brush

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
it was easy to apply to the eyebrow

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.069 
it was easy to apply to the eyebrow
it<00:03:22.230> wasn't<00:03:22.709> patchy<00:03:23.060> now<00:03:24.060> I<00:03:24.090> did<00:03:24.390> have<00:03:24.420> to<00:03:24.780> use

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079

well I had to dip my brush quite a few
times<00:03:27.750> like<00:03:28.019> three<00:03:28.319> times

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
times like three times

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.500 
times like three times
I<00:03:28.980> feel<00:03:29.609> like<00:03:29.700> this<00:03:29.819> brush<00:03:30.030> was<00:03:30.209> just<00:03:30.329> picking

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
I feel like this brush was just picking

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.330 
I feel like this brush was just picking
up<00:03:30.720> a<00:03:30.810> little<00:03:30.989> bit<00:03:31.140> of<00:03:31.230> product<00:03:31.439> at<00:03:31.709> a<00:03:31.769> time<00:03:31.829> and

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
up a little bit of product at a time and

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.369 
up a little bit of product at a time and
since<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.239> product<00:03:33.450> is<00:03:33.720> a<00:03:33.780> little<00:03:34.049> bit<00:03:34.170> drier

00:03:34.369 --> 00:03:34.379 
since the product is a little bit drier

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.280 
since the product is a little bit drier
than<00:03:34.560> Anastacio<00:03:35.569> Anastacio<00:03:36.569> tends<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:37.019> cling

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
than Anastacio Anastacio tends to cling

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.080 
than Anastacio Anastacio tends to cling
to<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.620> brushes<00:03:38.010> really<00:03:38.280> quickly<00:03:38.819> so<00:03:39.060> I

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
to the brushes really quickly so I

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.599 
to the brushes really quickly so I
usually<00:03:39.629> dab<00:03:39.959> it<00:03:40.170> anyways<00:03:40.650> on<00:03:41.010> my<00:03:41.129> on<00:03:41.400> the<00:03:41.489> back

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:41.609 
usually dab it anyways on my on the back

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:43.429 
usually dab it anyways on my on the back
of<00:03:41.760> my<00:03:41.849> hand<00:03:42.120> before<00:03:42.389> I<00:03:42.629> apply<00:03:43.049> it<00:03:43.109> because<00:03:43.349> it

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 
of my hand before I apply it because it

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.280 
of my hand before I apply it because it
could<00:03:43.590> be<00:03:43.680> too<00:03:43.889> harsh<00:03:44.180> but<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.540> actually<00:03:45.810> like

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
could be too harsh but I actually like

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.080 
could be too harsh but I actually like
this<00:03:46.560> one<00:03:46.829> just<00:03:47.040> because<00:03:47.370> I<00:03:47.400> don't<00:03:47.549> have<00:03:47.819> to

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:52.290 
it comes with the brush and the spoolie
which<00:05:51.100> I<00:05:51.220> actually<00:05:51.370> really<00:05:51.790> like<00:05:51.940> the<00:05:52.090> brush

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:52.300 
which I actually really like the brush

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.730 
which I actually really like the brush
and<00:05:52.450> the<00:05:52.540> spoolie<00:05:52.840> so<00:05:53.280> what<00:05:54.280> a<00:05:54.310> steal<00:05:54.610> and

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.200 
brushes for like 20 I think it's like 16
to<00:06:01.450> 20<00:06:01.690> dollars<00:06:02.010> and<00:06:03.010> that's<00:06:03.100> separate<00:06:03.760> so
