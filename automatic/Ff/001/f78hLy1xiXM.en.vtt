that's<00:02:26.480> so<00:02:26.540> incredible<00:02:27.080> is<00:02:27.260> that<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:28.100> think

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.680 
about the differences in living
standards<00:02:29.930> I<00:02:30.590> guess<00:02:31.130> the<00:02:31.370> way<00:02:32.090> to<00:02:32.150> put<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.480> is

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
standards I guess the way to put it is

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.550 
standards I guess the way to put it is
that<00:02:34.210> for<00:02:35.210> an<00:02:35.270> Ethiopian<00:02:35.750> person<00:02:36.110> coming<00:02:36.440> to

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
that for an Ethiopian person coming to

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.560 
that for an Ethiopian person coming to
America<00:02:36.980> it's<00:02:37.100> like<00:02:37.220> us<00:02:37.460> going<00:02:37.490> to<00:02:38.030> Disneyland

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570
