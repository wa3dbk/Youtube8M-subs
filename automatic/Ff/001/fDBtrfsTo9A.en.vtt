00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.779
 So one of my first internships I completed when he grew up 

00:00:10.779 --> 00:00:14.879
 Binder also got your device taken out asking I think it was two weeks 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.929
 I'll be there soon 

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:20.550
 Bouquet under the jacket hiding in the hospital must creep in and 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.640
 to say 'I will not give you less there 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.680
 and if I am no it's about internships I could do a book 

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:31.179
 what else to do with have decided to end this internship 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.390
 and 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:35.230
 Well thought the protest really did not meet mine 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.610
 The idea of ​​journalism is no longer thought about 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.430
 also the word should be if it looks like that then 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.010
 It is not for me and I am glad that I continued to top ten 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.850
 What I believe it is at the moment you can get away from Vogts is the valley a lot 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:53.600
 used 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.580
 loud things in the world 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.030
 in the world a twittering is chirped around 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.860
 simply because thanks to it about each 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.750
 every message as I get this bit differentiated and also more critical 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.950
 because I think there is a lot of it 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.200
 which I can not judge what and for whom the account gets 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.840
 Everybody should be rated, I think you have to be careful about APA 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.270
 the mandate is easy to learn after the world simply trumpets 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.920
 no sense going now finally cleared up 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.920
 and it did not go very critically by mere 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.420
 So I think that an editor is first editor, that is he 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.710
 should focus on the content 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.630
 sees fall over the ground and 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.030
 researching and being the story 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.760
 also occupied suter 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.530
 nonetheless noticeable topic also that is becoming increasingly important that you are with 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.540
 Low points so me 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:54.980
 and there is also one 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.460
 Camera also the ability to shoot and movies 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.880
 I think it will be more and more we have 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.320
 even for me but that would not be that is an editor in the future 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.699
 everything has to be done 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:09.709
 and because I just 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.849
 Peter Tamm and himself 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.999
 also turned up in addition 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:17.329
 then you lose sight of the essential and that's the content 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.069
 I think those are the ones now 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.069
 the 60 are not going to change now 

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:31.069
 Natalie Portman 

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.669
 Naturally 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:37.639
 There is no such thing as he is not but the 50 is important and they are also one 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.229
 Atkins unveiled Atkins and so it is not that we are like those in the 

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:43.589
 Internet did not fight out too rich on the budget will be on 8 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.560
 Andermatt abolish on average viewers as 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.579
 exciting speech of 63 years and are therefore I believe 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.129
 that's now the target group's budgets a bit colder and with her 

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:59.059
 Complex how do I behave completely set that has with that candidate 

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:02.279
 remain important though 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:05.649
 the younger people here to follow up a bit so 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:11.649
 maybe the best 60 65 believe in it is simply sweeping away activities I will 

00:03:11.649 --> 00:03:13.499
 you would be that way 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:16.049
 you can also be on the TV afterwards 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:19.819
 You can only swallow the Internet as a distribution channel if it's a few degrees 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:20.769
 to have a look
