00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.090
 chocolates the truth is very very simple 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.370
 the recipe is to lose

 and as soon as I finish watching you come back ok 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.920
 this recipe is very easy so let's go 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.920
 to see how it is done 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.619
 you need 3 cups of wheat flour one 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.840
 teaspoon baking powder half 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.240
 teaspoon of salt 2 bars 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.540
 unsalted butter 2 cups sugar 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.610
 Normal 4 eggs 3 teaspoons 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.350
 lemon zest 2 tsp 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.810
 lemon juice one teaspoon 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.729
 vanilla extract let's make milk 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.159
 sour and for that we need a cup of 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.190
 milk plus 4 teaspoons juice 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.220
 lemon a tray for layers cupcakes and 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.930
 two colors and a bowl the first thing that 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.640
 we have to do is to sift our 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.340
 three cups of flour together with our 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.810
 baking powder and our salt we are going to 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.550
 to make that bowl with our 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.770
 flour and we will occupy a container 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.720
 again and we're going to mix our two 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.090
 cups of sugar together with our two 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.320
 butters at room temperature and 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:53.420
 that those are well incorporated 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:55.759
 ingredients we are going to add one in 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.100
 one our eggs that is let's go to 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.869
 put an egg and let's beat and these 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.450
 let's put the other egg and let's 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.590
 beat very well and so with others 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.509
 remember to scratch the sides of your 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.200
 container so that our mixture is 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.200
 well homogeneous 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.209
 i 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.850
 Now let's add our extract 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.400
 of vanilla and our teaspoons of 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:25.050
 lemon juice and we beat again we are going to 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.280
 add in three times our flour 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.290
 that we previously served 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.480
 that is, you are going to put a cup of flour 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.830
 the salt is clear these are we going to put another 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.490
 cup of flour and you're going to mix 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.490
 completely 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.880
 do not 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.860
 and we put what remains without throwing 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.380
 and you're going to notice that it's going to be a bit 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.970
 difficult to continue beating your mix because 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.350
 it has started to become very special but 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.390
 do not worry because it's time to 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.000
 add our milk with lemon let's 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.160
 think how it's cut but that's how it is 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.810
 the consistency of this milk add 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.240
 what is necessary to give it that texture 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.530
 to the cupcakes so so so so rich you 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:05.960
 we are going to add the whole without splashing 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:09.880
 and we keep beating I'll have to scratch 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.880
 the sides of the tube continuously 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.680
 or not 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.840
 and finally we add the grated 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.870
 lemon and mix again last 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.870
 time 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.320
 and this is the consistency that should have 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.320
 our mixture is just a little thick 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.980
 how much is that hallways in your tray 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.690
 they always occupied a measuring cup 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.400
 of a quarter cup because it's like the 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.620
 Perfect measure for the cupcakes you 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.420
 leave that centimeter so that it sponges in 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.250
 the time to bake telesur is like the 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.930
 perfect measure 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.760
 i 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.640
 ah 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.709
 and now we take them from the oven to 160 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:09.989
 degrees for approximately 40 minutes 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.530
 until the two a little coffee 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.420
 gilded by the corner just like this 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.810
 if you want more degrees you can leave 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.430
 the impacts 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.220
 and now let's see how the 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.650
 frosting for this we need 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.810
 another two sticks of unsalted butter 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.270
 at room temperature a cup of 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.600
 icing sugar and four teaspoons of 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.600
 milk 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.819
 let's take our blender and let's 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:37.620
 stir a little before turning it on 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:39.659
 because if we learn it again then everything 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.300
 it's going to turn out well and you're just going to 

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.710
 cremate this perfectly perfectly and 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.270
 this is not necessary but I added 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.949
 lemon zest to also 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.949
 for lemon our frosting 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.909
 and since it has this consistency 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:59.960
 we're going to move him to a pastry bag 

00:04:55.909 --> 00:05:01.819
 with a pot and let's start decorating 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:03.889
 our cupcakes making a snail 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.569
 milestone out and then we're going to 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:07.280
 go up in such a way that it ends up as 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:09.230
 an ice cream 

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.330
 and so you're going to do with all your cupcakes 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.580
 and now let's make application 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.680
 fondant and for this you have to do the 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.300
 figurines in the fondant the most similar 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:18.919
 What can you do to those that I did? 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.320
 pierce a body with a stick 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:24.320
 pikachu and you're going to put two ends of 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.940
 stick to the ears and another tip to the 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.100
 tail the first thing you will do is 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:30.590
 hit the legs to the body after 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.660
 you are going to put the head after the tail 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.740
 to put the arms you simply have 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.169
 that press them towards your body 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.169
 and finally we are going to put the little ears 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:44.719
 I cut him a little bit because as with 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:47.150
 now with vegetable paint and a brush 

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:51.139
 new and very very very thin we are going to 

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:54.770
 draw the face or the little letters 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:57.889
 the black tips of his ears the eyes 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.740
 the exotic nose and so on more or less 

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:03.289
 it has to be pikachu and as I told you 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.810
 I did act way back south and 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:07.490
 rough but you can be whatever and 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.439
 if the pokemons you made have 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:11.749
 Stick simply enters the 

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:13.490
 part of our cupcake or if they are more 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:15.349
 little ones like mine only 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.569
 press them in the frosting and you're 

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:19.939
 now that they are super super nice and 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:22.039
 I made him some leather lenses because 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:24.500
 it's one of my favorite chapters you 

00:06:22.039 --> 00:06:26.060

 pokemon cupcakes do not know super 

00:06:30.199 --> 00:06:33.889
 rich and apart you do not even want 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.360
 eat the pokemones but well I would 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.340

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:42.139
 be as I indicated you can change 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:43.370
