 po 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.460
 Thank you very much 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.460
 all 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.410
 travelers ask for more 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.690
 which already we begin to doubt that they are people regarding the situation 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.690
 that have already converted into a total of one thousand 100 pieces of lego 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:37.980
 together with harmonix 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.810
 they dare to make a rock band 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.490
 accomplices of the fact 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.580
 lego rock band 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.070
 He spent his development in the same mechanics as the original rock pan 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.730
 being able to play the guitar the bass the battery and focusing controversy 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.050
 duckling provided graphic based on pieces of lego this proposal is 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.090
 difference for being aimed at a target more cases 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.100
 more families 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.990
 with 45 songs much less rocky and easier to play 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.410
 and up 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.040
 we were even the experts 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.030
 press the keys according to others the precise moment 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.360
 at this point who you do not know or carlos melgar 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.190
 if in other recent musicals pop artists have been appearing 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.290
 emblematic digitized 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:25.369
 the rojiblanco player, for example, indicated 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.200
 iggy pop min 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.460
 all of them made with lego pieces 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.280
 interpreting their own themes 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.930
 to whip part of the stage with our performance and get pieces of 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.230
 lego to customize accessories 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.720
 a rehearsal room 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.440
 but light original touch to the proposal 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.220
 45 different genre themes may be little 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.430
 but we can download from marcelo roldÃ¡n original 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:52.050
 lego rock band 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.430
 it is not as complete as the profane 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.430
 but it is more difficult 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.540
