00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
fullness of your expansion pre croaking

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.140 
fullness of your expansion pre croaking
how<00:01:25.299> you<00:01:25.360> can<00:01:25.990> get<00:01:26.350> in<00:01:26.590> on<00:01:26.979> who<00:01:27.640> you<00:01:27.940> were

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
how you can get in on who you were

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.190 
been before now we really really really
want<00:03:19.010> you<00:03:19.130> to<00:03:19.160> hear<00:03:19.460> that<00:03:19.700> because<00:03:20.000> most<00:03:20.990> of

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
want you to hear that because most of

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.980

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:23.990 
you don't understand the powerful reason

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.140 
you don't understand the powerful reason
for<00:03:24.200> coming<00:03:24.350> forth<00:03:24.800> you<00:03:25.250> don't<00:03:25.430> realize<00:03:25.880> that

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
for coming forth you don't realize that

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.940 
for coming forth you don't realize that
you<00:03:26.540> are<00:03:26.570> part<00:03:26.990> of<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:27.230> expanding<00:03:27.709> universe

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
you are part of the expanding universe

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.080 
you are part of the expanding universe
and<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.690> we<00:03:30.230> want<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.740> to<00:03:30.770> feel<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.790> fullness

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.690 
of your reason for coming forth into
this<00:03:35.270> time-space<00:03:36.020> reality<00:03:36.170> you<00:03:37.010> came<00:03:37.310> with

this time-space reality you came with

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:40.240 
this time-space reality you came with
great<00:03:37.970> reason<00:03:38.450> and<00:03:38.630> purpose<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.590> wanted<00:03:40.010> to

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
great reason and purpose you wanted to

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.580 
great reason and purpose you wanted to

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
explore and you wanted to have new ideas

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.170 
explore and you wanted to have new ideas
that<00:03:43.370> were<00:03:43.459> unique<00:03:43.640> unto<00:03:44.120> you<00:03:44.950> so<00:03:45.950> as<00:03:46.220> you<00:03:46.820> came

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
that were unique unto you so as you came

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:49.600 
that were unique unto you so as you came
forth<00:03:47.480> into<00:03:47.690> this<00:03:47.840> physical<00:03:48.320> body<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:49.400> knew

forth into this physical body you knew

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:51.130 
forth into this physical body you knew
that<00:03:49.640> you<00:03:49.940> would<00:03:50.090> explore<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.630> contrast

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
that you would explore the contrast

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:53.020 
that you would explore the contrast
because<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.620> knew<00:03:51.770> the<00:03:51.920> variety<00:03:52.430> is<00:03:52.580> what

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
because you knew the variety is what

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.180 
because you knew the variety is what

would help you to make your decisions

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.970

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
the contrast helped you to identify

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.330

story about who they are as source
energy<00:05:44.700> it's<00:05:45.480> like<00:05:45.750> I'm<00:05:46.320> source<00:05:46.920> energy<00:05:47.430> and

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:47.670 
energy it's like I'm source energy and

all<00:05:48.030> i<00:05:48.060> gotta<00:05:48.600> do<00:05:48.840> is<00:05:49.020> get<00:05:49.290> back<00:05:49.590> to<00:05:49.800> source

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:50.040 
all i gotta do is get back to source

all i gotta do is get back to source
energy<00:05:50.490> all<00:05:50.700> i<00:05:50.760> have<00:05:51.180> to<00:05:51.210> do<00:05:51.510> is<00:05:51.780> be<00:05:52.440> that<00:05:52.740> which

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.040 
energy all i have to do is be that which

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.580 
energy all i have to do is be that which
source<00:05:53.670> was<00:05:54.210> before<00:05:54.780> I<00:05:54.810> was<00:05:54.990> born<00:05:55.020> into<00:05:55.440> this

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
source was before I was born into this

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.200 
source was before I was born into this

the why you're going part you're leaving
out<00:05:59.790> that<00:06:00.030> what's<00:06:00.480> the<00:06:00.750> purpose<00:06:01.020> of<00:06:01.290> life<00:06:01.530> on

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
out that what's the purpose of life on

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.390 
out that what's the purpose of life on
planet<00:06:02.220> Earth<00:06:02.400> why<00:06:02.910> do<00:06:02.970> humans<00:06:03.720> or<00:06:04.020> anyone<00:06:04.740> why

planet Earth why do humans or anyone why

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.450 
planet Earth why do humans or anyone why
do<00:06:05.460> we<00:06:06.360> have<00:06:06.600> physical<00:06:07.350> expressions<00:06:08.100> of<00:06:08.220> life

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
do we have physical expressions of life

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:11.420 
do we have physical expressions of life
the<00:06:09.210> reason<00:06:09.720> that<00:06:09.990> the<00:06:10.530> physical<00:06:10.980> expression

the reason that the physical expression

the reason that the physical expression

of life is so important is because it is

00:06:13.140 --> 00:06:16.160 
of life is so important is because it is

the leading edge expression of life its

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.610 
the leading edge expression of life its
