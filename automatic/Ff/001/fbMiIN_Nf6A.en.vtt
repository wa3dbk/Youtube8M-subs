difficulty<00:02:03.610> I<00:02:03.670> think<00:02:05.640> since<00:02:06.640> it<00:02:07.240> just<00:02:07.500> hollows

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500

surrounded part here

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.649 
surrounded part here
I<00:03:01.959> measured<00:03:02.799> myself<00:03:03.010> out<00:03:03.400> here<00:03:03.760> about<00:03:04.330> this

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
I measured myself out here about this

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:07.830 
I measured myself out here about this
distance<00:03:05.250> rate<00:03:06.250> for<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.640> gears<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.239> spin<00:03:07.569> and

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
distance rate for the gears to spin and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:14.430 
distance rate for the gears to spin and
the<00:03:07.900> steam<00:03:08.140> to<00:03:08.319> go<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.769> jump<00:03:13.080> this<00:03:14.080> is<00:03:14.260> like<00:03:14.409> a

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
the steam to go and jump this is like a

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.100 
the steam to go and jump this is like a
cup<00:03:14.830> here<00:03:15.220> so<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:18.190> can<00:03:18.569> stand<00:03:19.569> against<00:03:19.989> the

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
cup here so you can stand against the

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:27.059 
cup here so you can stand against the
edge<00:03:21.569> aiming<00:03:22.569> for<00:03:22.810> this<00:03:23.280> bit<00:03:24.280> here<00:03:24.640> I<00:03:26.069> don't

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
edge aiming for this bit here I don't

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.740 
edge aiming for this bit here I don't
think<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.370> explained<00:03:27.790> that<00:03:27.849> as<00:03:28.030> well<00:03:28.209> as<00:03:28.390> I<00:03:28.569> did
