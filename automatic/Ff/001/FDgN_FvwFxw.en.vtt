00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
hey what's up guys this is fulcrums

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.059 
hey what's up guys this is fulcrums
motion<00:00:02.669> sensor<00:00:03.120> LED<00:00:03.720> porch<00:00:04.140> light<00:00:04.440> and<00:00:04.859> I<00:00:04.920> just

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
motion sensor LED porch light and I just

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:06.410 
motion sensor LED porch light and I just
picked<00:00:05.279> this<00:00:05.339> up<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.670> put<00:00:05.850> on<00:00:05.940> the<00:00:06.029> side<00:00:06.210> of<00:00:06.330> my

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
picked this up to put on the side of my

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.059 
picked this up to put on the side of my
house<00:00:06.600> just<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.960> use<00:00:07.140> for<00:00:07.470> some<00:00:07.649> more<00:00:07.830> lighting

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
house just to use for some more lighting

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.270 
house just to use for some more lighting
when<00:00:09.059> I<00:00:09.090> was<00:00:09.330> out<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.590> yard<00:00:10.860> when<00:00:11.099> it<00:00:11.190> was

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
when I was out in the yard when it was

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.850 
when I was out in the yard when it was
dark<00:00:11.610> and<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.300> motion<00:00:12.690> sensing<00:00:13.349> so<00:00:13.590> when

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
dark and it is motion sensing so when

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.499 
dark and it is motion sensing so when
you<00:00:13.950> walk<00:00:14.130> by<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.370> automatically<00:00:15.150> will<00:00:15.330> turn

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
you walk by it automatically will turn

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.180 
you walk by it automatically will turn
on<00:00:15.750> so<00:00:16.260> let's<00:00:16.410> take<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.590> quick<00:00:16.740> look<00:00:16.980> at<00:00:17.070> what

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
on so let's take a quick look at what

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.189 
on so let's take a quick look at what
comes<00:00:17.340> in<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.520> box<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.690> motion

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
comes in the box we have the motion

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.290 
comes in the box we have the motion
light<00:00:19.410> itself<00:00:19.949> and<00:00:20.220> if<00:00:20.880> we<00:00:20.970> look<00:00:21.119> at<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
light itself and if we look at the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.000 
light itself and if we look at the
motion<00:00:21.480> light<00:00:21.810> here<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.289> see<00:00:22.500> it<00:00:22.619> has<00:00:22.769> this

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
motion light here we can see it has this

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.460 
motion light here we can see it has this
back<00:00:23.279> plate<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:24.210> back<00:00:24.449> plate<00:00:24.660> slides<00:00:25.140> off

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
back plate this back plate slides off

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.859 
back plate this back plate slides off
and<00:00:25.740> allows<00:00:26.430> you<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:26.849> mount<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.240> LED<00:00:27.390> light

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
and allows you to mount the LED light

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.870 
and allows you to mount the LED light
taking<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.619> closer<00:00:28.830> look<00:00:28.949> at<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.369> light<00:00:29.609> the

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
taking a closer look at the light the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.290 
taking a closer look at the light the
light<00:00:30.090> does<00:00:30.330> spin<00:00:30.630> around<00:00:30.949> 360<00:00:31.949> degrees<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:33.210> it

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
light does spin around 360 degrees so it

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.389 
light does spin around 360 degrees so it
can<00:00:33.450> flip<00:00:33.750> if<00:00:33.989> it's<00:00:34.200> you<00:00:34.829> don't<00:00:34.980> want<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
can flip if it's you don't want the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:36.650 
can flip if it's you don't want the
light<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.730> come<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:35.910> necessarily<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.540> can

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
light to come on necessarily you can

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.040 
light to come on necessarily you can
flip<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.989> inwards<00:00:37.700> just<00:00:38.700> so<00:00:38.879> that<00:00:39.059> sensor<00:00:39.840> will

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
flip it inwards just so that sensor will

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.190 
flip it inwards just so that sensor will
not<00:00:40.079> go<00:00:40.379> off<00:00:40.590> now<00:00:41.579> this<00:00:41.850> does<00:00:42.239> run<00:00:42.510> off<00:00:42.719> of<00:00:42.930> four

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
not go off now this does run off of four

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.130 
not go off now this does run off of four
C<00:00:43.500> batteries<00:00:43.820> with<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.850> life<00:00:45.270> expectancy<00:00:45.960> of

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
C batteries with the life expectancy of

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.500 
C batteries with the life expectancy of
the<00:00:46.170> batteries<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.100> about<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.789> year<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.450> that's

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
the batteries of about a year so that's

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.740 
the batteries of about a year so that's
a<00:00:48.660> pretty<00:00:48.840> good<00:00:49.219> time<00:00:50.219> frame<00:00:50.610> for<00:00:50.910> four<00:00:51.270> C

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
a pretty good time frame for four C

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.930 
a pretty good time frame for four C
batteries<00:00:52.129> we<00:00:53.129> flip<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.430> around<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.789> the<00:00:53.850> back

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
batteries we flip it around to the back

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.880 
batteries we flip it around to the back
we'll<00:00:54.480> find<00:00:54.719> the<00:00:54.840> access<00:00:55.320> door<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.620> this<00:00:55.829> is

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
we'll find the access door and this is

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.069 
we'll find the access door and this is
allows<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.340> to<00:00:56.640> pull<00:00:57.480> out<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.840> battery

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
allows you to pull out the battery

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.810 
allows you to pull out the battery
cartridge<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.250> where<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.520> put<00:00:59.760> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
cartridge and this is where you put the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.060 
cartridge and this is where you put the
C<00:01:00.090> batteries<00:01:00.629> and<00:01:00.840> also<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.559> this<00:01:01.680> cartridge

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
C batteries and also in this cartridge

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.070 
C batteries and also in this cartridge
is<00:01:02.280> where<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.699> mounting<00:01:03.149> screws<00:01:03.570> can<00:01:03.899> be

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
is where the mounting screws can be

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.800 
is where the mounting screws can be
found<00:01:04.610> mounting<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.700> porch<00:01:05.939> light<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.360> super

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
found mounting the porch light is super

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.899 
found mounting the porch light is super
easy<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.830> drill<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.400> plate<00:01:08.640> into

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
easy you just drill the plate into

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.300 
easy you just drill the plate into
wherever<00:01:09.780> you<00:01:10.020> want<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.619> mounted<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
wherever you want to have it mounted and

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.070 
wherever you want to have it mounted and
then<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.820> can<00:01:11.970> take<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.330> light<00:01:12.510> on<00:01:12.750> and<00:01:12.990> off

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
then you can take the light on and off

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.020 
then you can take the light on and off
it<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.500> slips<00:01:13.799> down<00:01:13.979> over<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.490> lip<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.970> you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
it just slips down over that lip and you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.359 
it just slips down over that lip and you
can<00:01:15.180> position<00:01:15.360> it<00:01:15.860> basically<00:01:16.860> whatever<00:01:17.040> way

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
can position it basically whatever way

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.399 
can position it basically whatever way
you<00:01:17.430> want<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:18.180> porch<00:01:18.450> light<00:01:18.659> knows<00:01:18.840> only<00:01:19.290> to

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
you want the porch light knows only to

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.499 
you want the porch light knows only to
come<00:01:19.619> on<00:01:19.830> when<00:01:20.130> it's<00:01:20.310> darks<00:01:20.729> now<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:21.000> found<00:01:21.330> out

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
come on when it's darks now I found out

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.289 
come on when it's darks now I found out
the<00:01:21.720> motion<00:01:22.049> sensing<00:01:22.439> works<00:01:22.710> about<00:01:23.490> 15<00:01:24.000> feet

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
the motion sensing works about 15 feet

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.179 
the motion sensing works about 15 feet
so<00:01:24.570> if<00:01:24.630> you're<00:01:24.840> thin<00:01:25.020> 15<00:01:25.439> feet<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.770> this<00:01:25.950> and

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
so if you're thin 15 feet of this and

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.160 
so if you're thin 15 feet of this and
pitch-black<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:27.119> will<00:01:27.479> turn<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.900> so<00:01:28.080> that's

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
pitch-black it will turn on so that's

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.350 
pitch-black it will turn on so that's
not<00:01:28.380> too<00:01:28.560> bad<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:29.009> range<00:01:29.310> now<00:01:30.000> for<00:01:30.270> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
not too bad of a range now for the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.590 
not too bad of a range now for the
floodlight<00:01:30.840> itself<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.560> does<00:01:31.950> put<00:01:32.250> out<00:01:32.280> a

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
floodlight itself it does put out a

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.999 
floodlight itself it does put out a
pretty<00:01:33.600> decent<00:01:34.110> bright<00:01:34.409> light<00:01:34.740> it's

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
pretty decent bright light it's

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.380 
pretty decent bright light it's
definitely<00:01:35.430> one<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:35.850> don't<00:01:36.060> want<00:01:36.180> to

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
definitely one that you don't want to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.800 
definitely one that you don't want to
stare<00:01:36.689> into<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.770> does<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.950> significant<00:01:38.820> job

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
stare into and it does a significant job

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.560 
stare into and it does a significant job
at<00:01:40.140> lighting<00:01:40.619> up<00:01:40.799> I'd<00:01:41.610> say<00:01:41.880> about<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.150> twenty

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
at lighting up I'd say about a twenty

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.929 
at lighting up I'd say about a twenty
foot<00:01:42.780> area<00:01:43.140> so<00:01:43.770> it's<00:01:43.950> pitch-black<00:01:44.189> out<00:01:44.729> it's

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
foot area so it's pitch-black out it's

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.310 
foot area so it's pitch-black out it's
not<00:01:45.060> going<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.299> be<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> brightest<00:01:45.869> light<00:01:46.079> but

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
not going to be the brightest light but

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.550 
not going to be the brightest light but
you<00:01:46.350> can<00:01:46.619> still<00:01:47.060> see<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.390> lot<00:01:48.810> more<00:01:49.140> than<00:01:49.409> he

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
you can still see a lot more than he

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.710 
you can still see a lot more than he
would<00:01:49.799> if<00:01:50.100> there<00:01:50.340> wasn't<00:01:50.759> a<00:01:50.790> light<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:51.299> like<00:01:51.630> I
