00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
a total of six divisions it says six

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.940 
a total of six divisions it says six
here<00:03:27.209> but<00:03:27.420> in<00:03:27.780> the<00:03:27.959> in<00:03:28.109> leaked<00:03:28.410> pictures<00:03:28.650> that

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
here but in the in leaked pictures that

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.670 
here but in the in leaked pictures that
has<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.130> seventh<00:03:29.760> with<00:03:30.299> that<00:03:30.570> World<00:03:30.959> emblem<00:03:31.530> so

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
has a seventh with that World emblem so

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.110 
has a seventh with that World emblem so
maybe<00:03:31.859> you<00:03:32.010> get<00:03:32.190> that<00:03:32.370> if<00:03:32.519> you<00:03:32.700> are<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
maybe you get that if you are the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.110 
maybe you get that if you are the
festive<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.660> best<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.489> then<00:03:35.489> six<00:03:35.730> different

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
festive the best and then six different

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.509 
festive the best and then six different
divisions<00:03:36.540> with<00:03:37.019> each<00:03:37.260> division<00:03:37.590> resetting

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:38.519 
divisions with each division resetting

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:40.699 
divisions with each division resetting
at<00:03:38.640> the<00:03:38.790> start<00:03:39.060> of<00:03:39.150> each<00:03:39.299> season<00:03:39.750> that<00:03:40.410> is<00:03:40.560> that

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
at the start of each season that is that

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.039 
at the start of each season that is that
is<00:03:40.769> very<00:03:41.070> key<00:03:41.340> every<00:03:41.790> every<00:03:42.180> season<00:03:42.450> which

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
is very key every every season which

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.360 
is very key every every season which
I'll<00:03:43.200> talk<00:03:43.350> about<00:03:43.410> in<00:03:43.590> a<00:03:43.739> second<00:03:44.070> but<00:03:44.160> every

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
I'll talk about in a second but every

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.729 
I'll talk about in a second but every
season<00:03:44.549> you<00:03:45.090> reset<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:46.019> that<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.380> previous

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
season you reset and that the previous

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.610 
season you reset and that the previous
season<00:03:47.190> seemingly<00:03:47.970> doesn't<00:03:48.420> matter<00:03:48.630> because

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
season seemingly doesn't matter because

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.160 
season seemingly doesn't matter because
it<00:03:49.799> resets<00:03:50.519> every<00:03:50.760> season<00:03:50.970> each<00:03:51.450> division<00:03:51.900> is

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
it resets every season each division is

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.009 
it resets every season each division is
broken<00:03:52.530> up<00:03:52.620> into<00:03:52.829> subdivisions<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:54.019> 250

00:03:55.009 --> 00:03:55.019 
broken up into subdivisions of 250

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:56.690 
broken up into subdivisions of 250
players<00:03:55.290> so<00:03:55.500> say<00:03:55.739> you<00:03:55.799> win<00:03:56.370> your<00:03:56.579> division

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
players so say you win your division

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.000 
players so say you win your division
you're<00:03:57.480> really<00:03:57.810> only<00:03:57.959> winning<00:03:58.380> against<00:03:58.859> the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
you're really only winning against the

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.940 
you're really only winning against the
250<00:03:59.970> other<00:04:00.120> players<00:04:00.510> not<00:04:01.109> everyone<00:04:01.709> in<00:04:01.920> that

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:01.950 
250 other players not everyone in that

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.009 
250 other players not everyone in that
certain<00:04:02.459> division<00:04:02.880> that<00:04:03.540> kind<00:04:03.810> of<00:04:03.870> makes

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
certain division that kind of makes

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.259 
certain division that kind of makes
sense<00:04:04.260> just<00:04:04.470> due<00:04:04.890> to<00:04:04.920> matchmaking<00:04:05.609> and<00:04:06.090> stuff

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
sense just due to matchmaking and stuff

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:08.660 
sense just due to matchmaking and stuff
like<00:04:06.390> that<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:07.290> finally<00:04:07.890> says<00:04:08.100> these<00:04:08.340> players

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
like that and finally says these players

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.849 
like that and finally says these players
in<00:04:09.000> your<00:04:09.329> subdivision<00:04:09.630> will<00:04:10.260> be<00:04:10.380> whom<00:04:10.620> you

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
in your subdivision will be whom you

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.559 
in your subdivision will be whom you
directly<00:04:11.310> compete<00:04:11.730> with<00:04:11.910> so<00:04:12.120> if<00:04:12.209> that<00:04:12.359> makes

00:04:12.559 --> 00:04:12.569 
directly compete with so if that makes

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:15.650 
directly compete with so if that makes
sense<00:04:12.750> now<00:04:13.019> talking<00:04:13.560> about<00:04:13.829> the<00:04:13.980> seasons<00:04:14.660> this

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
sense now talking about the seasons this

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.270 
sense now talking about the seasons this
the<00:04:16.019> league<00:04:16.260> play<00:04:16.500> is<00:04:16.530> broken<00:04:17.039> up<00:04:17.130> into

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
the league play is broken up into

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.300 
the league play is broken up into
seasons<00:04:17.789> each<00:04:18.060> lasting<00:04:18.359> approximately<00:04:19.310> 30

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
seasons each lasting approximately 30

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.700 
seasons each lasting approximately 30
calendar<00:04:20.910> days<00:04:21.090> so<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:22.049> seasons<00:04:22.440> really

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
calendar days so the seasons really

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.380 
calendar days so the seasons really
aren't<00:04:22.979> that<00:04:23.010> long<00:04:23.310> it's<00:04:23.580> about<00:04:23.789> a<00:04:23.820> month<00:04:24.060> long

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
aren't that long it's about a month long

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:27.050 
aren't that long it's about a month long
and<00:04:24.659> at<00:04:25.229> the<00:04:25.349> end<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:26.220> season<00:04:26.280> there<00:04:26.789> will<00:04:26.849> be

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
and at the end of a season there will be

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.390 
and at the end of a season there will be
a brief<00:04:27.419> window<00:04:27.780> of<00:04:27.960> time<00:04:28.410> before<00:04:28.919> the<00:04:29.250> next

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.409 
ranking and actually says right here
your<00:05:04.950> ranking<00:05:05.280> is<00:05:05.400> determined<00:05:06.000> by<00:05:06.120> ladder

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
your ranking is determined by ladder

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.719 
your ranking is determined by ladder
points<00:05:06.870> that<00:05:07.050> can<00:05:07.229> be<00:05:07.290> earned<00:05:07.620> or<00:05:07.889> lost<00:05:08.460> by<00:05:08.700> a

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
playing games your team will start at

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.219 
playing games your team will start at
zero<00:05:11.040> rank<00:05:11.310> points<00:05:11.760> nfpa<00:05:12.300> at<00:05:12.570> the<00:05:12.810> start<00:05:13.139> of

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
zero rank points nfpa at the start of

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.290 
zero rank points nfpa at the start of
each<00:05:13.380> season<00:05:13.650> and<00:05:14.040> winds<00:05:14.669> will<00:05:14.880> earn<00:05:15.090> you

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
each season and winds will earn you

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.330 
each season and winds will earn you
points<00:05:15.330> losses<00:05:16.110> will<00:05:16.290> lose<00:05:16.530> you<00:05:16.710> points<00:05:17.100> the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
points losses will lose you points the

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.740 
points losses will lose you points the
points<00:05:17.370> earned<00:05:17.850> are<00:05:18.060> determined<00:05:18.570> by<00:05:18.720> the

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
points earned are determined by the

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.780 
points earned are determined by the
predicated<00:05:19.620> outcome<00:05:20.100> of<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.400> game<00:05:20.430> so

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:20.790 
predicated outcome of the game so

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.450 
predicated outcome of the game so
basically<00:05:21.240> if<00:05:21.419> you<00:05:21.810> lose<00:05:22.050> you<00:05:22.620> lose<00:05:22.650> points<00:05:23.220> if

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
basically if you lose you lose points if

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.070 
basically if you lose you lose points if
you<00:05:23.580> win<00:05:23.760> you<00:05:23.880> win<00:05:24.030> points<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.570> that<00:05:24.660> is<00:05:24.870> the

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
you win you win points and that is the

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.750 
you win you win points and that is the
only<00:05:25.229> way<00:05:25.650> seemingly<00:05:26.160> right<00:05:26.400> now<00:05:26.550> the<00:05:26.610> only

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
only way seemingly right now the only

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.370 
only way seemingly right now the only
way<00:05:27.180> to<00:05:27.750> to<00:05:28.020> rank<00:05:28.260> up<00:05:28.410> is<00:05:28.650> by<00:05:28.860> winning<00:05:29.330> now<00:05:30.380> like

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
way to to rank up is by winning now like

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.219 
way to to rank up is by winning now like
I<00:05:31.500> said<00:05:31.530> earlier<00:05:31.860> you<00:05:32.280> can<00:05:32.610> play<00:05:32.940> solo<00:05:33.810> but<00:05:34.110> you

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229 
I said earlier you can play solo but you

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:36.290 
I said earlier you can play solo but you
can<00:05:34.350> also<00:05:34.500> play<00:05:34.740> in<00:05:34.800> a<00:05:34.919> team<00:05:35.130> I'm<00:05:35.910> interested

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300 
can also play in a team I'm interested

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:38.000 
can also play in a team I'm interested
to<00:05:36.570> see<00:05:36.810> how<00:05:36.960> that's<00:05:37.169> going<00:05:37.320> to<00:05:37.380> work<00:05:37.440> if<00:05:37.830> you

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
to see how that's going to work if you

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.900 
to see how that's going to work if you
play<00:05:38.280> solo<00:05:38.640> and<00:05:39.060> it's<00:05:39.690> like<00:05:40.430> six<00:05:41.430> LOL<00:05:41.669> guys

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:41.910 
play solo and it's like six LOL guys

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.090 
play solo and it's like six LOL guys
against<00:05:42.300> a<00:05:42.390> team<00:05:42.630> of<00:05:42.750> six<00:05:42.960> die<00:05:43.380> i<00:05:43.410> don't<00:05:43.860> think

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:44.100 
against a team of six die i don't think

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.770 
against a team of six die i don't think
that<00:05:44.280> is<00:05:44.520> i<00:05:44.820> don't<00:05:45.300> think<00:05:45.360> that<00:05:45.510> would<00:05:45.720> work

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:45.780 
that is i don't think that would work

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.590 
that is i don't think that would work
out<00:05:46.140> too<00:05:46.410> well<00:05:46.440> for<00:05:46.590> you<00:05:46.979> hopefully<00:05:47.760> it's<00:05:48.300> if

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 
out too well for you hopefully it's if

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.120 
out too well for you hopefully it's if
you<00:05:48.750> want<00:05:48.990> to<00:05:49.050> play<00:05:49.169> solo<00:05:49.440> your<00:05:49.650> plan<00:05:49.860> against

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
to go solo with with five strangers

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:14.659 
to go solo with with five strangers
against<00:06:12.090> a<00:06:12.210> team<00:06:12.630> of<00:06:12.810> six<00:06:13.020> that<00:06:13.289> is<00:06:13.500> going<00:06:14.490> try

00:06:14.659 --> 00:06:14.669 
against a team of six that is going try

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:17.000 
against a team of six that is going try
hard<00:06:14.940> to<00:06:15.000> get<00:06:15.300> that<00:06:15.600> top<00:06:15.900> division<00:06:16.560> that<00:06:16.740> top

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:17.010 
hard to get that top division that top

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:19.460 
hard to get that top division that top
ranking<00:06:17.520> in<00:06:17.669> this<00:06:18.210> league<00:06:18.419> play<00:06:18.660> so<00:06:18.720> I'm

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
ranking in this league play so I'm

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.050 
ranking in this league play so I'm
guessing<00:06:19.770> it's<00:06:20.160> going<00:06:20.310> to<00:06:20.370> be<00:06:20.490> team<00:06:20.820> source

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060 
guessing it's going to be team source

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.629 
guessing it's going to be team source
teams<00:06:21.419> and<00:06:21.720> solo<00:06:22.139> teams<00:06:22.410> were<00:06:22.650> solo<00:06:23.100> team<00:06:23.340> so

00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 
teams and solo teams were solo team so

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.250 
teams and solo teams were solo team so
