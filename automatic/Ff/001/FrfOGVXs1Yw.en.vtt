know checking to see how they're doing
but<00:00:21.380> let's<00:00:21.770> face<00:00:21.980> it<00:00:22.220> i<00:00:22.340> am<00:00:22.669> getting<00:00:22.880> old<00:00:23.210> and<00:00:23.540> i

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:24.349 
but let's face it i am getting old and i

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.040 
but let's face it i am getting old and i
just<00:00:24.650> can't<00:00:24.980> remember<00:00:25.220> dates<00:00:25.669> anymore<00:00:26.050> and

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
just can't remember dates anymore and

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:28.810 
just can't remember dates anymore and
then<00:00:27.230> also<00:00:27.500> my<00:00:27.800> desk<00:00:28.009> is<00:00:28.189> a<00:00:28.220> mess<00:00:28.310> so<00:00:28.669> if<00:00:28.759> i

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:28.820 
then also my desk is a mess so if i

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.519 
then also my desk is a mess so if i
write<00:00:29.000> something<00:00:29.390> down<00:00:29.419> that<00:00:30.079> it<00:00:30.169> ends<00:00:30.470> up

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
write something down that it ends up

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.520 
write something down that it ends up
getting<00:00:30.650> lost<00:00:31.279> and<00:00:31.730> it's<00:00:32.239> just<00:00:32.570> um<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.350> best

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
getting lost and it's just um the best

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.020 
getting lost and it's just um the best
way<00:00:33.680> for<00:00:33.860> me<00:00:33.890> to<00:00:34.010> be<00:00:34.190> efficient<00:00:34.640> is<00:00:34.760> to<00:00:34.910> do

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:35.030 
way for me to be efficient is to do

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.060 
way for me to be efficient is to do
something<00:00:35.390> online<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.140> i<00:00:36.170> decided<00:00:36.770> that<00:00:36.890> i'm

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
something online so i decided that i'm

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.279 
something online so i decided that i'm
going<00:00:37.160> to<00:00:37.250> start<00:00:37.489> an<00:00:37.699> online<00:00:38.210> calendar<00:00:38.809> to

00:00:39.279 --> 00:00:39.289 
going to start an online calendar to

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.900 
going to start an online calendar to
keep<00:00:39.440> track<00:00:39.649> of<00:00:39.710> weight<00:00:40.160> loss<00:00:40.340> surgery<00:00:40.489> dates

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
keep track of weight loss surgery dates

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.490 
keep track of weight loss surgery dates
and<00:00:41.120> then<00:00:41.600> i<00:00:41.690> thought<00:00:41.899> that<00:00:42.199> this<00:00:42.350> would

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
and then i thought that this would

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.810 
and then i thought that this would
probably<00:00:42.649> be<00:00:42.949> something<00:00:43.309> that<00:00:43.460> would<00:00:43.670> be

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
probably be something that would be

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.189 
probably be something that would be
useful<00:00:43.910> to<00:00:44.179> everybody<00:00:44.600> so<00:00:44.780> i'm<00:00:44.899> going<00:00:44.989> to<00:00:45.050> make

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199 
useful to everybody so i'm going to make

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.160 
useful to everybody so i'm going to make
it<00:00:45.320> public<00:00:45.710> and<00:00:46.239> and<00:00:47.239> i<00:00:47.539> hope<00:00:47.719> that<00:00:47.929> you<00:00:47.960> guys

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.579 
will think this is a good idea i think
it's<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:50.000> great<00:00:50.120> way<00:00:50.359> to<00:00:50.420> keep<00:00:51.320> track<00:00:51.500> of
