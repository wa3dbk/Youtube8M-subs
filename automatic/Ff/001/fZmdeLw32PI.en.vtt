 hello youtubers in this little but 

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.990
 meaty video tutorial I will teach you 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.469
 how to put your games in window mode 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.990
 windows that do not know what a whore is 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.360
 windows window 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.820
 this is a missing windows window 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:20.920
 of culture as they only get stuck 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.720
 at that point facebook giving milk to 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.449
 the fucking keys and with calluses in the 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:27.519
 fingers that's why they do not progress but 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:30.490
 well, you, I take care of what's mine 

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:32.920
 Let's start with the explanation is very 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.630
 easy and simple first and before 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.700
 everything will have to create an access 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.689
 direct of the game on our desk 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.689
 [Music] 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.910
 Well then they give right click and 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:49.240
 go down to properties 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:53.220
 [Music] 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.220
 you will get a little picture like that 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.800
 they look at the destination there they should say 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.219
 letters ending in dot exe 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.219
 quotation marks 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.450
 the only thing to do is after 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.750
 the quotes leave a space write 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:18.659
 a script and then write windows 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:21.149
 then click apply and then accept 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.759
 they will have their game ready in sale mode 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:26.219
 no windows will ask what it's for 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.530
 this first of all this video I did 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.539
 because I did not know what else to do and second 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.219
 that all the window windows pretty 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.499
 practice for those to whom they 

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:36.600
 bother the games in full screen 

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:38.700
 or that in addition to being playing are 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.709
 talking to someone or something like that 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.719
 true for me it is quite practical and I 

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.149
 The game is very good 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.099
 something like this will remain so that they can 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.770
 minimize to open other windows 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:52.140
 good bastards this was all I hope 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.969
 they serve them as a comment, subscribe if 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.040
 the point where they will not fall 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:02:09.849
 arm for doing it 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:09.849
