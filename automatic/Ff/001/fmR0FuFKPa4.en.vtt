00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
explodes really depends on how many

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.919 
explodes really depends on how many
players<00:01:19.039> you're<00:01:19.310> having<00:01:19.610> because<00:01:20.570> there's<00:01:20.840> a

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
players you're having because there's a

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:22.779 
players you're having because there's a
number<00:01:21.140> of<00:01:21.320> days<00:01:21.500> for<00:01:21.860> each<00:01:22.100> number<00:01:22.670> of

number of days for each number of
players<00:01:23.030> before<00:01:23.450> it<00:01:23.690> explodes<00:01:24.140> it<00:01:24.410> is<00:01:24.530> 10<00:01:24.830> and

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:24.979 
players before it explodes it is 10 and

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.380 
players before it explodes it is 10 and
up<00:01:25.070> I<00:01:25.160> believe<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.729> what<00:01:25.850> is<00:01:25.940> this<00:01:26.060> in<00:01:26.149> the<00:01:26.210> box

cars<00:01:55.220> that<00:01:55.430> do<00:01:55.549> actions<00:01:55.939> like<00:01:56.390> you<00:01:56.689> get<00:01:56.810> an

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
cars that do actions like you get an

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.389 
cars that do actions like you get an
extra<00:01:57.020> move<00:01:57.320> because<00:01:57.590> normally<00:01:58.130> on<00:01:58.250> every

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:58.399 
extra move because normally on every

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.069 
extra move because normally on every
turn<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:58.850> only<00:01:58.939> get<00:01:59.090> to<00:01:59.299> move<00:01:59.509> so<00:01:59.719> you<00:01:59.840> move

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
turn you only get to move so you move

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.920 
turn you only get to move so you move
one<00:02:00.200> alien<00:02:00.409> twice<00:02:00.770> or<00:02:01.100> two<00:02:01.369> aliens<00:02:01.729> once<00:02:02.149> well

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
one alien twice or two aliens once well

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.399 
one alien twice or two aliens once well
that<00:02:03.079> didn't<00:02:03.290> work<00:02:03.320> out

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
that didn't work out

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.109 
that didn't work out
I'm<00:02:04.649> really<00:02:04.859> glad<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.460> dropped<00:02:05.789> that<00:02:05.909> that

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
I'm really glad it dropped that that

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.150 
I'm really glad it dropped that that
would<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.299> been<00:02:06.390> bad<00:02:06.799> but<00:02:07.799> there<00:02:08.069> are

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
would have been bad but there are

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.499 
would have been bad but there are
several<00:02:08.399> lift<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.759> points<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.090> come<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
several lift up points to come in the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.029 
several lift up points to come in the
base<00:02:09.660> game<00:02:09.690> and<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.470> you<00:02:10.590> can<00:02:10.679> play<00:02:10.860> with<00:02:10.979> a

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
base game and so you can play with a

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.100 
base game and so you can play with a
random<00:02:11.370> set<00:02:11.550> if<00:02:11.670> you<00:02:11.730> want<00:02:11.940> or<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.569> can<00:02:12.599> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
random set if you want or you can to

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.170 
random set if you want or you can to
play<00:02:13.349> with<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.920> recommended<00:02:14.400> or<00:02:14.790> you<00:02:15.090> can

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
play with the recommended or you can

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.100 
play with the recommended or you can
start<00:02:15.390> with<00:02:15.480> recommended<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:15.989> put

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
start with recommended and put

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.619 
start with recommended and put
terraforming<00:02:16.769> cards<00:02:17.069> in<00:02:17.220> your<00:02:17.549> deck<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.060> when

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
terraforming cards in your deck and when

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:19.880 
terraforming cards in your deck and when
somebody<00:02:18.900> play's<00:02:19.049> there<00:02:19.230> they<00:02:19.349> can<00:02:19.470> swap<00:02:19.739> out

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
somebody play's there they can swap out

somebody play's there they can swap out
lift<00:02:20.129> off<00:02:20.250> points<00:02:20.549> during<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.940> game<00:02:21.120> which<00:02:21.720> is

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
lift off points during the game which is

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.210 
lift off points during the game which is
one<00:02:22.379> of<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.470> reasons<00:02:22.739> that<00:02:22.769> really<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.099> this

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
one of the reasons that really like this

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.500 
one of the reasons that really like this
game<00:02:23.400> because<00:02:23.670> it<00:02:23.849> makes<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.239> more

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
game because it makes it more

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.420 
game because it makes it more
interesting<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.739> fact<00:02:25.980> that<00:02:26.040> you<00:02:26.160> will<00:02:26.250> allow

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
interesting the fact that you will allow

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.550 
interesting the fact that you will allow
players<00:02:26.760> to<00:02:26.910> do<00:02:27.239> that<00:02:27.420> once<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.349> get<00:02:28.470> your

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
players to do that once you get your

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.650 
players to do that once you get your
aliens<00:02:29.040> on<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.610> live<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:30.000> point<00:02:30.299> then<00:02:30.540> the

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
aliens on to live that point then the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.630 
aliens on to live that point then the
lift<00:02:30.840> off<00:02:30.959> point<00:02:31.170> has<00:02:31.349> to<00:02:31.440> activate<00:02:31.799> every<00:02:32.370> lip

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
lift off point has to activate every lip

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.460 
lift off point has to activate every lip
that<00:02:32.790> point<00:02:33.060> has<00:02:33.239> an<00:02:33.360> activation<00:02:33.720> cost<00:02:34.080> which

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
that point has an activation cost which

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.559 
that point has an activation cost which
is<00:02:34.709> pretty<00:02:34.890> common<00:02:35.400> and<00:02:35.700> easy<00:02:35.730> to<00:02:36.000> see<00:02:36.180> in

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
is pretty common and easy to see in

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.020 
is pretty common and easy to see in
addition<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.319> cost<00:02:37.650> usually<00:02:38.370> it<00:02:38.640> requires

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
addition to a cost usually it requires

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.420 
addition to a cost usually it requires
something<00:02:39.540> from<00:02:39.810> the<00:02:39.930> move<00:02:40.140> so<00:02:40.799> the<00:02:40.920> mood<00:02:41.160> has

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
something from the move so the mood has

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.030 
something from the move so the mood has
to<00:02:41.610> be<00:02:41.700> in<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.879> certain<00:02:42.090> phase<00:02:42.510> I<00:02:42.989> really<00:02:43.829> like

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
to be in a certain phase I really like

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.559 
to be in a certain phase I really like
the<00:02:44.250> moon<00:02:44.430> phase<00:02:44.730> mechanic<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.269> lift<00:02:45.450> on

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
the moon phase mechanic and lift on

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.539 
the moon phase mechanic and lift on
because<00:02:45.900> what<00:02:46.019> happens<00:02:46.379> is<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:47.340> is<00:02:47.400> a

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
because what happens is is this is a

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.250 
because what happens is is this is a
planet<00:02:47.790> and<00:02:48.060> there's<00:02:48.239> a<00:02:48.329> moon<00:02:48.569> that<00:02:48.599> is<00:02:48.870> going

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
planet and there's a moon that is going

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.110 
planet and there's a moon that is going
around<00:02:49.319> this<00:02:49.739> planet<00:02:49.980> at<00:02:50.579> the<00:02:50.670> end<00:02:50.819> of<00:02:50.879> every

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
around this planet at the end of every

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.449 
around this planet at the end of every
turn<00:02:51.390> you<00:02:51.720> in<00:02:52.140> your<00:02:52.319> move<00:02:52.500> by<00:02:52.739> moving<00:02:52.980> the<00:02:53.280> moon

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
turn you in your move by moving the moon

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.670 
turn you in your move by moving the moon
once<00:02:54.329> you've<00:02:54.510> moved<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.959> moon<00:02:55.110> your<00:02:55.410> turn<00:02:55.560> is

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
once you've moved the moon your turn is

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.729 
once you've moved the moon your turn is
done<00:02:56.060> liftoff<00:02:57.060> points<00:02:57.420> activate<00:02:57.959> according

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
done liftoff points activate according

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.650 
done liftoff points activate according
to<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:59.220> moon<00:02:59.370> phase<00:02:59.640> so<00:03:00.030> some<00:03:00.299> will<00:03:00.329> only

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
to the moon phase so some will only

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.869 
to the moon phase so some will only
activate<00:03:01.140> a<00:03:01.200> full<00:03:01.440> some<00:03:01.920> only<00:03:02.220> activated<00:03:02.579> new

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
activate a full some only activated new

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.360 
activate a full some only activated new
room<00:03:03.090> some<00:03:03.660> will<00:03:04.079> require<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.410> die<00:03:04.739> roll<00:03:05.069> and

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
room some will require a die roll and

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.309 
room some will require a die roll and
what<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.700> guy<00:03:06.000> role<00:03:06.209> has<00:03:06.359> to<00:03:06.480> be<00:03:06.629> depends<00:03:07.140> on

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
what that guy role has to be depends on

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:08.930 
what that guy role has to be depends on
where<00:03:07.620> the<00:03:07.769> moon<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.069> in<00:03:08.340> relation<00:03:08.760> to<00:03:08.849> the

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
where the moon is in relation to the

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.449 
where the moon is in relation to the
platform<00:03:09.359> this<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.109> important<00:03:10.440> part<00:03:10.470> what

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
platform this is the important part what

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.610 
platform this is the important part what
phase<00:03:11.790> the<00:03:12.060> moon<00:03:12.239> is<00:03:12.480> is<00:03:12.690> always<00:03:13.109> in<00:03:13.260> relation

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
phase the moon is is always in relation

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.530 
phase the moon is is always in relation
to<00:03:13.709> the<00:03:13.799> platform<00:03:14.040> so<00:03:14.849> if<00:03:15.150> there<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.510> a

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
to the platform so if there is a

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.420 
to the platform so if there is a
platform<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:16.200> the<00:03:16.290> moon<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.739> directly<00:03:17.250> above

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
platform and the moon is directly above

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.129 
platform and the moon is directly above
it<00:03:17.639> that<00:03:17.970> means<00:03:18.150> it's<00:03:18.299> a<00:03:18.389> full<00:03:18.630> moon<00:03:18.810> for<00:03:19.049> that

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
it that means it's a full moon for that

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.949 
it that means it's a full moon for that
platform<00:03:19.349> and<00:03:19.769> only<00:03:20.280> that<00:03:20.430> puppet<00:03:20.669> if<00:03:21.599> there's

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
platform and only that puppet if there's

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.960 
platform and only that puppet if there's
a<00:03:22.049> moon<00:03:22.319> on<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.680> opposite<00:03:23.370> side<00:03:23.549> of<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.700> board
