00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.740
 Hello, my two-wheeled friends 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.049
 Today we will have such a non-standard 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.849
 review of motorcycle equipment in particular 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.300
 a motorcycle helmet that has been in 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.120
 crash my friends mean slam model and 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.830
 unix is ​​probably worth a few words 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.350
 say about this brand but a little later 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.210
 let me show you now 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.730
 these are chips and scratches that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:28.050
 occurred as a result of a crash with this helmet 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:32.250
 Look, I hope everyone will be fine 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.759
 well what can I see guys 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.980
 uekz 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.750
 as far as I know this is German 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.680
 manufacturer of various equipment 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.680
 helmets particular security features for 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.969
 motorcyclists skiers for those who are 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.340
 various extreme sports 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.629
 participate initially on themselves 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.059
 positioned as a company by 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.370
 making wayne glass protective masks 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.410
 But over time, turned into a big 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.300
 concert and here at the moment he has the same 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.920
 very large niche in production 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.289
 various goods including for 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.170
 motorcycle technology the name itself and 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:07.290
 wax stands for uveitis serve 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.670
 that is, it is the absence of ultraviolet without 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.290
 ultraviolet that is like this 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.210
 way 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.040
 film they started producing another 90 if 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.290
 I am not mistaken this is such an average price 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.630
 range of guys from this case here 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.850
 This helmet costs about 100 euros but 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.070
 a feature of this helmet my friends 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.259
 is not that I'm you something 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:28.770
 I'll show you what happened with this helmet 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.909
 after the accident and you yourself will appreciate the scale 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.860
 damage looks great from 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.890
 helmet on this side and now look 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.890
 here, please 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:49.570
 I mean yes yes we are here 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:51.790
 dent somewhere diameter 17 centimeters 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.630
 about five centimeters deep 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:57.910
 how did it happen now tell mean 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.240
 the helmet itself consists of three composite 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:05.260
 the fibers here are and fiberglass and 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.860
 kevlar and little matrix carbon but the thing 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.600
 not in this uniqueness eat i repeat 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.540
 This helmet is a little bit in 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.980
 a friend look means a guy who 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.680
 rode in this helmet you can not 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.170
 survive he is alive and well thank god how 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.510
 it says to fools newbies lucky and here 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:25.840
 him from all this crash suffered only 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.670
 elbow you ponder yes here's a dent 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.770
 so funny guy hurt only 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.010
 elbow what actually happened 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.190
 means the guy to go into a turn here 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.830
 went into a turn and a turn to the left of 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.239
 him through the lane there was traffic 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:43.420
 two-way one lane each 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:45.910
 the storm was in the spring pocket what 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.680
 a small guy wanted to call in this 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.350
 pocket stop rest i don't know 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.000
 what he wanted to do is not the point 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.370
 the guy started changing lanes 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.860
 oncoming traffic in advance and in which 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.340
 turning a classic mistake to meet 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:02.230
 This guy was driving a tractor Kirots guys 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.660
 these are the ones who know what a Kiroman is 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.970
 You can imagine this edifice present but at 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.090
 naturally panicked squeezed both 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.640
 the brakes on the track were sand naturally 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.660
 motorcycle guy flies under the tractor 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:15.850
 together with a motorcycle 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.390
 one of the wheels of the front is moving 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:21.250
 Motorcycle second wheel Man's head 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.040
 gets under the front wheel of this 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.890
 tractor and front wheel tractor 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.690
 rides him on this helmet what 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:31.540
 the word plastic itself happens 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.790
 monocoque and she bursts under that word 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.290
 there is a foam casing and here 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.080
 listen carefully what happened 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.030
 further after the tractor drove it 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.400
 all burst foam casing 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.340
 started sliding down squeezing out my head 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.709
 pilot from this helmet that is think about it 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.970
 In general, how much brick factories managed 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.550
 during this time build this miserable 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.740
 boy 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:54.680
 here's the clasp stretched to maxim 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:58.800
 which was here she's a valve 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.640
 here's a clasp like this 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.550
 yes, that is, she is like this 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.410
 unzipped during this time she 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.140
 stretched out on maxims like a guy's 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.190
 has been buttoned here and plus with these 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:12.690
 Here are foam inserts textile 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.910
 start squeezing head and slam then 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:18.720
 there is literally a head 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:20.459
 that's more precisely the pilot's helmet slipped from him with 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.620
 baski like a rubber cap from a swimmer 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.600
 to know if it is for the crown to pull it 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.780
 just slip off like this 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:30.960
 this helmet slid off the pilot's head 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.450
 That is, this helmet has justified itself 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.490
 all two hundred percent in quality and in 

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:38.520
 protection guys though inexpensive price 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:40.200
 category but I can confidently say I 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.080
 very much could go held in his hands that 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.000
 here is the merit of the fact that there is not a solid 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:47.580
 namely a hole here is such a trough with 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.930
 the cracks is exactly what the plant 

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:51.060
 the manufacturer uses the correct 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.410
 material guys that is at a certain 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.790
 load helmet really god 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.890
 burst otherwise your head will burst 

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:58.610
 inside this helmet but in this case 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.169
 when the wheel smoothly ran into this helmet 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.020
 should have happened exactly here 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.540
 such a thing and it happened that is 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.370
 the head slipped out of that helmet and 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.980
 thanks to this the pilot stayed 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.600
 stayed alive in cheap helmets applied 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.970
 not 3 composite material like 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.290
 ordinary fiberglass is used 

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.020
 which is real on impact if u 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.180
 man well fomin blow away 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.440
 can beat one hit and such 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.570
 cases really saw their own 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:27.480
 eyes guys would ear helmets like that 

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:29.760
 Here is the way they developed 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.100
 carefully show you again here 

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:34.290
 this here this all disgrace 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:37.350
 look and make appropriate 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:39.540
 conclusions guys and you should be next 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.700
 that you should not save on motor-equipment 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.800
 my friends in this case man 

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.169
 just to say he was lucky it wasn’t 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.840
 say nothing you constantly watch and 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:51.440
 estimate the scale of the damage when i 

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.400
 first saw the photos of this helmet 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:56.280
 The reasonable question was the following. 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:06:00.000
 when we go and the funeral you know but glory 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.840
 god thank god these are in profile like 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:09.389
 it would just cut it Bulgarian is a member 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:12.570
 they took the turbines and cut off my 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:15.360
 two-wheeled friends so I repeat 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.010
 guys first wear a helmet in the second 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.380
 do not save on moto 

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:22.530
 gear because it's your life and 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:25.050
 this is your health now bikers 

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:28.139
 Ochirov bikers this I call fresh 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:29.699
 motorcyclists traveled a lot here 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.820
 Recently, too, the case was driving to work 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:35.460
 I look well, you see, looking at them 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:37.139
 just one thought they are great 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.200
 just here they are great you understand 

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:42.300
 Hawaiian shirt Hawaiian shorts and 

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.190
 slippers flip flops well, that's all the elements 

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:46.410
 protections that must be present 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:48.870
 a pilot who drives a liter 

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:51.360
 sportbike morons need to understand but 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:53.010
 no other word carried food and people 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:55.350
 either did not see what happens to 

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:57.300
 motorcyclists who fall for 

00:06:55.350 --> 00:06:59.100
 speeds that don't have whale peers 

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:00.810
 whether they don't know just were born they don't 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.490
 understand that asphalt is he hard he 

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:05.070
 scratched if you fly head against it 

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:07.139
 down that is mysterious perfectly 

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:09.330
 friends and looking at registration numbers 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:12.120
 you can see that the registration is fresh 

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:13.590
 years but you know if they themselves do not 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.110
 understand and teach them life 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:18.150
 that's why guys are my main goal 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.760
 Here is this review that I did was 

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:24.270
 so that people see this here 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:26.760
 understood how important a role is played in 

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.120
 protect motorcycle equipment in particular in 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:32.580
 In this case it was a helmet 

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:34.470
 so we are little two-wheeled friends 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.139
 I wish you good luck God forbid he 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:39.450
 face similar circumstances 

00:07:36.139 --> 00:07:41.789
 do not save on motorcycle equipment remember about 

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:42.930
 the fact that they are waiting for you at home smooth background of roads 

00:07:41.789 --> 00:07:46.940
 guys and good luck 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.940
 all the best with you was the assault sanya
