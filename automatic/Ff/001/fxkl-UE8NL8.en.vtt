missions<00:06:50.050> means<00:06:50.289> that<00:06:50.409> they're<00:06:50.680> really<00:06:51.099> going

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
missions means that they're really going

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.850 
missions means that they're really going
to<00:06:51.789> push<00:06:52.030> for<00:06:52.060> a<00:06:52.300> whole<00:06:52.599> new<00:06:52.870> story<00:06:53.139> like

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:53.860 
to push for a whole new story like

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.320 
to push for a whole new story like
they're<00:06:54.039> gonna<00:06:54.219> increase<00:06:54.610> the<00:06:54.849> story<00:06:55.090> so<00:06:55.270> if

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:55.330 
they're gonna increase the story so if

00:06:55.330 --> 00:06:56.580 
they're gonna increase the story so if
those<00:06:55.479> are<00:06:55.599> you<00:06:55.689> think<00:06:55.930> that<00:06:56.050> the<00:06:56.229> story<00:06:56.500> is

00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:56.590 
those are you think that the story is

00:06:56.590 --> 00:06:59.339 
those are you think that the story is
too<00:06:57.039> bland<00:06:57.340> and<00:06:57.639> destiny<00:06:58.030> better<00:06:59.020> think<00:06:59.259> again

00:06:59.339 --> 00:06:59.349 
too bland and destiny better think again

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:00.779 
too bland and destiny better think again
because<00:06:59.590> once<00:06:59.830> this<00:06:59.919> dlc<00:07:00.250> comes<00:07:00.460> out<00:07:00.580> you

00:07:00.779 --> 00:07:00.789 
because once this dlc comes out you

00:07:00.789 --> 00:07:02.790 
because once this dlc comes out you
probably<00:07:01.030> won't<00:07:01.330> be<00:07:01.419> saying<00:07:01.569> anything<00:07:01.800> but

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
probably won't be saying anything but

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.339 
probably won't be saying anything but
that<00:07:03.159> isn't<00:07:03.520> same<00:07:03.729> for<00:07:04.479> new<00:07:04.599> strikes<00:07:04.960> and<00:07:05.199> a

00:07:05.339 --> 00:07:05.349 
that isn't same for new strikes and a

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:07.890 
that isn't same for new strikes and a
new<00:07:05.500> raid<00:07:05.830> the<00:07:06.340> raid<00:07:06.550> will<00:07:06.849> probably<00:07:07.629> most

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:07.900 
new raid the raid will probably most

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:10.980 
new raid the raid will probably most
likely<00:07:07.960> deal<00:07:08.379> with<00:07:08.620> the<00:07:08.740> hive<00:07:08.979> as<00:07:09.219> a<00:07:09.279> wall<00:07:09.990> just

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:10.990 
likely deal with the hive as a wall just

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:12.929 
likely deal with the hive as a wall just
because<00:07:11.229> the<00:07:11.379> new<00:07:11.620> destination<00:07:12.310> be<00:07:12.639> Maeve

00:07:12.929 --> 00:07:12.939
