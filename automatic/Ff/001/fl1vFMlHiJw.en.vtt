object<00:02:15.210> said<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:15.780> pilot<00:02:15.960> then<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:16.830> noticed<00:02:17.310> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
object said the pilot then I noticed the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.430 
object said the pilot then I noticed the
water<00:02:17.610> beam<00:02:17.940> underneath<00:02:18.480> it<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:18.870> kind<00:02:19.320> of

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
water beam underneath it it kind of

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.220 
water beam underneath it it kind of
looked<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:19.740> a<00:02:19.860> long<00:02:20.310> clear<00:02:21.090> straw<00:02:21.600> you<00:02:22.200> can

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
looked like a long clear straw you can

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.050 
looked like a long clear straw you can
see<00:02:22.560> that<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:22.950> really<00:02:22.980> does<00:02:23.400> right<00:02:23.700> over<00:02:23.880> here

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
see that it really does right over here

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.790 
see that it really does right over here
okay<00:02:26.840> kind<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.900> look<00:02:27.990> like<00:02:28.020> a<00:02:28.170> long<00:02:28.470> clear

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
okay kind of look like a long clear

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.920 
okay kind of look like a long clear
straw<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.670> i<00:02:29.700> radioed<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.210> let<00:02:30.510> them<00:02:30.690> know<00:02:30.900> I

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
straw so i radioed to let them know I

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.710

from<00:03:24.720> some<00:03:24.990> satellites<00:03:25.790> finding<00:03:26.790> the<00:03:26.940> water

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
from some satellites finding the water

from some satellites finding the water
for<00:03:27.990> them<00:03:28.110> and<00:03:28.290> such<00:03:28.410> but<00:03:29.010> uh<00:03:29.250> obviously<00:03:30.090> we

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
for them and such but uh obviously we

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.080 
for them and such but uh obviously we
can<00:03:31.590> see<00:03:31.950> that<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.340> object<00:03:32.970> really<00:03:33.810> is

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
can see that this object really is

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.430 
can see that this object really is
sucking<00:03:36.090> in<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.210> water<00:03:36.480> you<00:03:37.080> can<00:03:37.230> see<00:03:37.260> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
sucking in the water you can see the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.120 
sucking in the water you can see the
beam<00:03:37.770> now<00:03:39.260> let's<00:03:40.260> see<00:03:40.410> what<00:03:40.590> happens<00:03:40.890> when<00:03:41.070> I

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.130 
beam now let's see what happens when I

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:46.010 
beam now let's see what happens when I
try<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.700> alter<00:03:43.010> adjust<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.100> color<00:03:44.690> okay<00:03:45.690> bring

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
try to alter adjust the color okay bring

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.100 
try to alter adjust the color okay bring
this<00:03:46.170> over<00:03:46.670> we'll<00:03:47.670> try<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:47.910> adjust<00:03:48.360> the<00:03:48.840> color

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
this over we'll try to adjust the color

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.660 
this over we'll try to adjust the color
a<00:03:49.200> little<00:03:49.470> bit<00:03:49.560> so<00:03:49.740> we<00:03:49.830> can<00:03:49.950> see<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.250> beam<00:03:50.430> more

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
a little bit so we can see the beam more

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.400 
a little bit so we can see the beam more
clearly<00:03:52.250> okay<00:03:53.250> we<00:03:53.400> can<00:03:53.550> still<00:03:53.790> see<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.150> beam

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.410 
clearly okay we can still see the beam

00:03:54.410 --> 00:04:04.840 
clearly okay we can still see the beam
mostly<00:03:55.410> just<00:03:55.620> right<00:03:55.800> here<00:03:55.980> though<00:03:57.620> okay

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.800 

Bheema<00:04:05.660> water<00:04:05.930> going<00:04:06.230> all<00:04:06.470> the<00:04:06.830> way<00:04:06.860> down<00:04:07.010> uh

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
Bheema water going all the way down uh

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.140 
Bheema water going all the way down uh
this<00:04:08.810> big<00:04:09.110> stupid<00:04:09.440> arrows<00:04:10.010> really<00:04:10.550> in<00:04:10.700> our<00:04:10.880> web

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
this big stupid arrows really in our web

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.540 
this big stupid arrows really in our web
can't<00:04:11.660> see<00:04:11.960> it<00:04:12.080> entering<00:04:12.530> the<00:04:12.650> water<00:04:12.890> so<00:04:13.490> I

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:13.550 
can't see it entering the water so I

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:16.720 
can't see it entering the water so I
imagine<00:04:13.880> right<00:04:14.330> about<00:04:15.110> here<00:04:15.770> is<00:04:15.920> where<00:04:16.489> it

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:16.730 
imagine right about here is where it

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:18.460 
imagine right about here is where it
enters<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.120> water<00:04:17.270> because<00:04:17.660> we<00:04:17.780> don't<00:04:18.080> see

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
enters the water because we don't see

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:21.490 
enters the water because we don't see
the<00:04:18.739> stream<00:04:19.370> coming<00:04:19.640> over<00:04:19.910> here<00:04:20.180> now<00:04:21.050> the

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
the stream coming over here now the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.280 
the stream coming over here now the
question<00:04:21.950> is<00:04:22.100> let<00:04:22.850> me<00:04:22.880> reset<00:04:23.300> back<00:04:23.570> okay<00:04:24.050> it's

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:24.290 
question is let me reset back okay it's

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.640 
question is let me reset back okay it's
original<00:04:24.800> now<00:04:24.950> the<00:04:25.610> question<00:04:26.030> is<00:04:26.320> was<00:04:27.320> this

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:27.650 
original now the question is was this

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.080 
original now the question is was this
UFO<00:04:28.520> beaming<00:04:29.390> and<00:04:29.570> stealing<00:04:30.260> water<00:04:30.700> uh<00:04:31.700> well

first<00:04:32.450> of<00:04:32.660> all<00:04:32.690> it's<00:04:32.870> not<00:04:32.990> really<00:04:33.230> stealing

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.410 
first of all it's not really stealing

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:34.990 
first of all it's not really stealing
water<00:04:33.770> it's<00:04:33.950> not<00:04:34.070> ours<00:04:34.220> in<00:04:34.430> the<00:04:34.490> first<00:04:34.730> place

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.640 
water it's not ours in the first place
we're<00:04:35.840> kind<00:04:36.050> of<00:04:36.110> stealing<00:04:36.320> it<00:04:36.470> from

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
we're kind of stealing it from
