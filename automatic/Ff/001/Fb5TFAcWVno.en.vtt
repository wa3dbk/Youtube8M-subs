00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.479 
you're ready to apply you like rub it in
again<00:04:16.630> and<00:04:16.810> you<00:04:16.930> warm<00:04:17.169> up<00:04:17.320> with<00:04:17.500> your<00:04:17.650> knee<00:04:17.799> the

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
again and you warm up with your knee the

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:19.920 
again and you warm up with your knee the
good<00:04:18.669> thing<00:04:18.820> about<00:04:18.910> these<00:04:19.239> strips<00:04:19.600> is<00:04:19.750> like

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
good thing about these strips is like

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.170 
good thing about these strips is like
you<00:04:20.169> can<00:04:20.350> cut<00:04:20.590> them<00:04:20.799> into<00:04:21.220> like<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.639> sizes

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
you can cut them into like the sizes

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.900 
you can cut them into like the sizes
that<00:04:22.419> you<00:04:23.139> need<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:24.460> they're<00:04:24.580> double<00:04:24.880> sided

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
that you need and they're double sided

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.740 
that you need and they're double sided
so<00:04:25.800> when<00:04:26.800> you<00:04:27.010> warm<00:04:27.370> them<00:04:27.490> up<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.390> tear

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
so when you warm them up and you tear

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.460 
so when you warm them up and you tear
them<00:04:28.900> apart<00:04:29.100> there's<00:04:30.100> wax<00:04:30.430> on<00:04:30.790> both<00:04:31.630> sides<00:04:32.020> so

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
them apart there's wax on both sides so

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.430 
them apart there's wax on both sides so
you're<00:04:32.650> not<00:04:32.770> wasting<00:04:33.100> product<00:04:33.610> or<00:04:33.850> anything

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
you're not wasting product or anything

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
you're not wasting product or anything
