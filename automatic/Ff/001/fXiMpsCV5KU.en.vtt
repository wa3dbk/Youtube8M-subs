00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.710
 channel is an overview of the best cheats i'm sorry 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.080
 Sedov on maycraft poket edishn 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:17.340
 but for now, believe it 011 alone 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.119
 my first shield I want to show 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.890
 on this series or rather just one type 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.560
 I'll show you at church we will be long 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:31.920
 consider this robot sitting syrup what 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.570
 drive I apologize much confused let's 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:41.399
 we got the number on the construction site 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:51.620
 an ordinary shield is a robot generating the world 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:52.829
 guys and yet we appeared on the tree and 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.039
 right away 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:00.989
 we see the trees and well in this 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:04.019
 there is nothing special about the village 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.250
 one other village is nothing 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:12.360
 probably even if we make a range 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.729
 drawing times so the site is at a maximum then 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:17.040
 see no village nothing 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:23.130
 noteworthy in the department we find not 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:25.939
 we can well really no i have found empathetic 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:33.630
 and the second village I was a little wrong 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:41.900
 just wear not progruzlas in the language in 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.900
 I believe the faith is not as you noticed there is no home 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:54.680
 blacksmiths lady who used to sleep 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:59.540
 little chest know and yes and in this village 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:02.540
 polpuda is also not our home 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.820
 blacksmiths let's remove immediately about 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.060
 Wood at the minimum so that we do not 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.940
 I let you down so leg is all the same 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:16.400
 apply to hedge progruzhat 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:20.210
 the world and how my trick here anything interesting 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.400
 it would be useful for us to survive but what 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:26.120
 wonderful this type why are you him 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.870
 wanted to tell the jungle and important but here 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.850
 what is important is what is in this well 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:38.720
 the very first village that can 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.140
 trade interesting no okay evil 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:46.460
 example we will want to go to the well 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:51.320
 swim we jump and what do we see 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:58.220
 some kind of stone is weird in fact 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:03:02.989
 this is not a stone this is an abandoned portal in 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:06.800
 ender world so how would i choose a hair 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:08.209
 no will yell and immediately shut down like 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:17.880
 do you just see before your eyes 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:29.550
 created i didn't create anything so we do 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:31.830
 since it did the same thing yes 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.630
 pop-and-pop 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:39.280
 all but still let me consider this 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:43.150
 a portal to the world of Ender for all at once will 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:45.730
 break and let's go see what we have 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.680
 so interesting I still sit in my coffin 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.780
 on unreasonable 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.780
 the portal well, what immediately started us 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.910
 leads 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:08.580
 let's go consider further bent we 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:11.740
 come down go here so on 1 this down 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:14.800
 so the second one also go down 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:21.040
 I wonder what will be clear what will happen 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:23.500
 go up but up here 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:26.040
 library will seem to be abandoned 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.150
 if my memory fails me 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.210
 abandoned library should be 

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:33.640
 a little chest well let's check 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:36.000
 By the way what the fuck is that not 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:42.600
 found in normal minecraft 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.600
 they did not find or not so important 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:50.620
 they don't you even library it just 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.410
 climb up and I found that crap in 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:57.010
 normal minecraft so need to pass 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:05:00.430
 climb up what are they to over and 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:08.340
 came or not or we did not come from above 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:08.340
 so here as we see a lot of grids 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:19.360
 here you can fuck jokes and just well 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:22.240
 have lattices made up of us 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.990
 flower in iron selling out of eight 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:28.390
 more precisely, sorry for my mistake as well 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:34.900
 that and the door can also be on so this 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:37.270
 very good weekend mine is more accurate 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.190
 mine abandoned portal gone i'm confused 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:51.160
 that constantly so this is our pillar 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:54.460
 and so were yes we were here to return more 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:06:04.410
 still walk like a quintet and I want 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:04.410
 find the portal magicians than find our portal 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:12.419
 there lifting lifting lifting lifting it 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.419
 zhor let's go back 

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:21.370
 in short there he goes about nothing we don't 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:26.919
 lose so ayato-kuna need to go down all 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:30.669
 lower and lower down and down lower and lower and the 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:34.960
 here we find the fountain guys exactly 

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:37.930
 fountain he iron also big room 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.550
 you see, even if it's not even 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.770
 it is important for you to find the portal 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.930
 here you just need to cut these holes 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:47.979
 fake and everything and you can live that is 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:50.710
 can build an underground article house 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:54.460
 I want to start che children letsplay 

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:57.120
 survival and think going on it because of 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.890
 I will give myself a red card I will survive 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:03.729
 before its price to what is there with us 

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:09.220
 a and miranda boots with a knife 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:13.090
 whether itâ€™s useful but so I think another bitch 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:17.280
 see all the gold iron bib y 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:17.280
 understand what it is 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:23.030
 ok i think 

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:25.670
 portal with no link to let let 

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:28.280
 this is all its bottom pakistan consequences 

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:30.890
 comments if you want a defeat 

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:32.630
 put them very good gray 

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:33.370
 thumbs up and write about it in 

00:07:32.630 --> 00:07:37.330
 comments 

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:40.060
 that 's all good luck everyone bye 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:45.050
 so I found all the same portal 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:46.660
 Well, I found that part of it our little 

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:49.220
 part 

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:51.520
 so that you do not get confused, I immediately 

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.650
 I will say his coordination you certainly want 

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.580
 I saw him , of course , only because I 

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:59.030
 at home by id card 

00:07:55.580 --> 00:08:03.380
 I have already said it will play you and I will say 

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:07.360
 you don't need x 1489 coordinate 

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:14.110
 for it is 104 and the height of the well is the bedrock 

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:14.110
 land 37 i.e.
