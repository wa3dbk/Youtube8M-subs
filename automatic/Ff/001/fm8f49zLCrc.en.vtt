going 120 engineering I wanted to set

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.620 
going 120 engineering I wanted to set
myself<00:00:32.369> another<00:00:32.790> go<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.300> keeps<00:00:33.420> replaying

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
myself another go so it keeps replaying

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.160 
myself another go so it keeps replaying
and<00:00:34.050> that<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:35.010> do<00:00:35.219> 200<00:00:35.610> mil<00:00:36.300> woodcutting<00:00:36.780> XP

and that is to do 200 mil woodcutting XP

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.470 
and that is to do 200 mil woodcutting XP
I<00:00:37.520> find<00:00:38.520> woodcutting<00:00:38.910> really<00:00:39.239> good<00:00:39.360> fun

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
I find woodcutting really good fun

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.139 
I find woodcutting really good fun
actually<00:00:39.800> surprisingly<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.070> I<00:00:41.700> thought<00:00:42.059> I'd

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
actually surprisingly and I thought I'd

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.510 
actually surprisingly and I thought I'd
be<00:00:42.239> a<00:00:42.270> good<00:00:42.420> go<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.660> aim<00:00:43.170> for<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.530> mean<00:00:43.739> 200<00:00:44.370> mil

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
be a good go to aim for I mean 200 mil

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400 
be a good go to aim for I mean 200 mil
is<00:00:44.670> a<00:00:44.700> lot<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.940> XP<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.510> I<00:00:45.719> need<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> hundred<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
is a lot of XP and I need a hundred and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.319 
is a lot of XP and I need a hundred and
eighty<00:00:46.559> free<00:00:46.860> meal<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.219> actually<00:00:47.850> achieve<00:00:48.120> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
eighty free meal to actually achieve it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.600 
eighty free meal to actually achieve it
but<00:00:48.570> um<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.410> fact<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> the<00:00:49.860> matter<00:00:49.920> is<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.430> could

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
but um the fact of the matter is I could

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.819 
but um the fact of the matter is I could
do<00:00:50.760> many<00:00:51.270> live<00:00:51.570> streams<00:00:51.899> on<00:00:52.170> wood<00:00:52.530> cutting

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
do many live streams on wood cutting

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.170 
do many live streams on wood cutting
which<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:53.670> think<00:00:53.910> would<00:00:54.000> be<00:00:54.149> really

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
which I think would be really

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.750 
which I think would be really
entertaining<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:55.350> you<00:00:56.250> guys<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.640> get

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
entertaining and you guys can get

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.130 
entertaining and you guys can get
involved<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.239> buy<00:00:57.480> you<00:00:57.539> know<00:00:57.750> woodcutting

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
involved to buy you know woodcutting

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.459 
involved to buy you know woodcutting

that'd be really good fun I've already

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.760 
that'd be really good fun I've already
recorded<00:01:08.820> episode<00:01:09.150> one<00:01:09.390> where<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:09.990> traveled<00:01:10.619> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
recorded episode one where I traveled to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.950 
recorded episode one where I traveled to
some<00:01:10.979> oak<00:01:11.220> trees<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.610> started<00:01:12.420> chopping<00:01:12.630> them

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
some oak trees and started chopping them

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.320 
some oak trees and started chopping them
and<00:01:13.200> episode<00:01:13.890> 2<00:01:14.100> will<00:01:14.580> see<00:01:14.729> me<00:01:14.850> move<00:01:15.030> up<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
and episode 2 will see me move up to the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.179 
and episode 2 will see me move up to the
willow<00:01:15.600> logs<00:01:15.869> or<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.229> willow<00:01:16.409> tree<00:01:16.500> sorry<00:01:16.950> and

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
willow logs or the willow tree sorry and

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.039 
willow logs or the willow tree sorry and
chop<00:01:18.030> them<00:01:18.060> down<00:01:18.240> so<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.630> think<00:01:18.720> that'd<00:01:18.930> be<00:01:18.990> a

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
chop them down so I think that'd be a

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.600 
chop them down so I think that'd be a
really<00:01:19.290> good<00:01:19.500> series<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.100> do<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.369> should<00:01:20.549> be

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
really good series to do it should be

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.539 
really good series to do it should be
really<00:01:20.850> good<00:01:21.000> fun<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.420> I've<00:01:22.380> never<00:01:22.920> seen<00:01:23.250> any

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
really good fun and I've never seen any

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.070 
really good fun and I've never seen any
of<00:01:23.640> anything<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.330> that<00:01:24.360> on<00:01:24.509> YouTube<00:01:24.990> before

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
of anything like that on YouTube before

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.690 
of anything like that on YouTube before
so<00:01:25.409> it's<00:01:25.500> gonna<00:01:25.590> be<00:01:25.710> something<00:01:25.860> new<00:01:26.100> something

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
so it's gonna be something new something

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.880 
so it's gonna be something new something
different<00:01:26.790> and<00:01:27.380> hopefully<00:01:28.380> you<00:01:28.409> know<00:01:28.650> I<00:01:28.680> can

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
different and hopefully you know I can

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
actually achieve the massive 200 mil

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.319
