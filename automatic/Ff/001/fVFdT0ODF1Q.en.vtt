00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.320
 do not 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.789
 it's a very nice memory, my beginning in 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.680
 the league endesa also that day we 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.090
 we faced against juventus where 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:28.579
 played mario fernÃ¡ndez a base that 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.739
 he was here for many years and he left 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:33.440
 footprint in the fans and in the own one 

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:35.690
 club we also get we do not get 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.070
 win we lost two points and that 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.790
 beginning of season, then a little 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.790
 complicated 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.080
 well it would be difficult to say that all 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.460
 moments but but some like the 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.350
 first win to get the league 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.940
 Endesa against Barcelona on this court 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.420
 also with follow-up the first 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.410
 points then I keep them with memory with 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:01.179
 I thought they seemed very good match 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.579
 I remember last year when we passed the 

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:06.580
 playoff against cashier when 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.470
 we went to the cup semifinals 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.150
 it could be said in many moments but 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.150
 those are perhaps the most beautiful 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.000
 Well, this morning, one more morning 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.940
 they just started to enter all the 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.550
 throw anything at the track 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:27.550
 it left and besides the student is that day 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.320
 I was allowing enough shots 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.630
 and happening behind us the blockages and 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.370
 for all the right day and get 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.150
 also the embi asks of the day that 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.680
 for a player with my characteristics 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.680
 it is quite complicated 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.390
 the best I do not know but I could tell you 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.920
 two or three against Barcelona over 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.009
 some defense about Juan Carlos Navarro 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.840
 I remember it and it seems like matches 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.640
 very nice maybe that black job that 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.649
 Sometimes some party is not seen so much 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.720
 against bilbao with two extensions here in 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.689
 home that we were good I was able to a 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.220
 little change the pace of play but 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.390
 that would be the matches that you could 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.390
 say black work 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.280
 very well I think we have a very team 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.420
 compensated with two players per 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.519
 position that I can do it well 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.950
 anyone at any time 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.080
 also with me on track the team is 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.150
 having very good partial and 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.769
 happy moment 40 we can not ask 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.459
 more and I hope to continue at this level and that 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.459
 my team keep winning 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.860
 I hope to see me in the league endesa in acb 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:36.069
 whatever it is called but playing 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.069
 basketball
