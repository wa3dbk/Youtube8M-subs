00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.629
 welcome to the best cards whole 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.130
 bio in this format , I show in each 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.080
 Follow five cards personally 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.069
 the best cards will count whole bio 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.599
 Note that some of the above 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.389
 cards are banned because they are easy to 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.820
 In addition, there are not many cards 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.070
 the cs strong houston or the staples 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.080
 are and they definitely belong 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.820
 Also in this format job is the new one 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.529
 to suggest cards for the format and 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.410
 Although in the comments and I wish 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.519
 have fun now! 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.289
 The first card for today is called 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.660
 a mirror of the mirror power a new wall 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.309
 fund recently released one 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.420
 normal fall card with the effect though 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.010
 he monsters against the intervene 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.149
 declares all monsters in 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.610
 Attack position the opponent 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.350
 Checked on the back at the euro 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.899
 It is the fund that destroys one 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.399
 keep not giving back years yes 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.930
 well, the new airforce makes that 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.039
 bit different 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.450
 she goes back to that and that has 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.420
 many advantages but also some 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.460
 disadvantages for example if the opponent 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.469
 many fishermen out of the extra the kart 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.570
 then of course that requires genius because 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:01.350
 the fingers fly is external complete 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.670
 away almost during several funds 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.719
 year in the cemetery would bring where 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.420
 you may still be able to access them 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.040
 if you can against it however completely 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.409
 many normal monsters have lying outside 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.290
 So normal effect monster eg with usern 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.180
 you then he is almost against the stop 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.250
 really not a good agent but there at 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.780
 svs horny again that's why you have to 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.979
 decide what to put in when 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.860
 connection situation that is better 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.409
 some that I personally like more that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.420
 wall fund but I think you can 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.590
 roaring mirror power also play on 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.329
 every case is one of the best cards 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.820
 In any case, the cards awesome effect 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.100
 and this equivalent to the almost 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.939
 I agree as I said before 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.939
 a little bit prefer 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.500
 The next card must definitely be in 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.320
 every time four x3 namely the slide 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.960
 gaga cowboy ranked fourth with the 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.420
 property he has and the type warrior 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.060
 1500 2400 and we summoned with two 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.140
 monster level 4 once playful so completely 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.820
 agree on material from this map 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.470
 depend on this effect 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.039
 depending on the current fight 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.630
 position of card attack position because 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.580
 this card in this game to one 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.080
 monster of the opponent attacks them 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.820
 only that will be with 6,000 items 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.019
 additionally loses the monster of 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.209
 opponent's noven that man himself 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.739
 politician here one must note that 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.620
 you already activate the mine phase 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.569
 must forget most and then 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.280
 yes it had miss play and worked 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.980
 effects would no longer have been around 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.450
 suffered Defense Position add 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.739
 then after 100 days to go to the 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.230
 important calls in 90 percent of cases 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:31.970
 you hurt him because of the burn because 800 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.980
 points can make the bag and 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.709
 That's why you play the cowboy in almost 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.209
 every user space is there 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.130
 few cards nobody above the cowboy 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.739
 But the body would kick 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.030
 mostly with it also with very many 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.120
 themes simply because he just pure 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.920
 it fits very often the situation 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.530
 that my opponent somehow after ten 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.180
 round on no idea 500 pence down 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.380
 and then he has something left over 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.060
 to tear the duel around 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.970
 and then you would still be 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.829
 loser you probably so close to it since then 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.769
 But with cowboy you can stop for a short time 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:06.260
 even before he breaks the bag why 

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:08.209
 close or you can still do it 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.579
 somehow though the opponent already 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.530
 control somehow still has that 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.760
 chor astronomer to finish with it 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.079
 although he actually does 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.410
 If it does not lose the body 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:20.120
 give that is why the card is in it 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.319
 you do not have it you will 100pro 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.060
 someday have a situation that he 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.560
 loses because the cowboy does not have it 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.730
 and that's why you play him next 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.959
 always have a typical 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.730
 forbidden spell card namely 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:33.980
 seizure a normal magic card 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.269
 with the effect of 2001 around the cards 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.010
 to look at the hand of an opponent 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.019
 choose a card merckx in the cemetery 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.970
 From the map is just super unfair man 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:42.049
 can thus change the hand of the opponent 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.000
 Just look at what 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.220
 is chubby and then you can still 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
 the best card that has 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.900
 courageously let go to the cemetery 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.010
 cards can be grad for 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:53.300
 you need weighty come 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.530
 could be dangerous or too 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.230
 any things same or 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.030
 Otherwise the price with 1000 live points 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:03.830
 pay completely irrelevant live points 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:06.170
 is not - no big at least and the 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:09.680
 card just almost no downside her 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:11.150
 simply goes plus plus here 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.760
 loses and confiscation he loses 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.170
 his best card and you still know that 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.519
 hand of your opponent while you are 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:21.440
 you have subtracted just about 1000 prices 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.640
 have gone plus and in almost everyone 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.600
 situation therefore seizure too well 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.890
 card number four is once again a 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.780
 stamp in everyone must always know 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:31.400
 effect verschleierung a receiver 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:34.180
 monster club of property 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.980
 light without pécser values ​​0 0 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:38.960
 yes it's just a hand rap the effect 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:40.790
 is during the final phase of the opponent 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.230
 Can this card from the night on the 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:43.310
 lay cemetery and then an open word 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:44.960
 effect monsters fight back that he 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.850
 control canceled until the end of the 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.050
 Defective the open monsters 

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.470
 your opponent 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.060
 This is a fast effect one plays 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.160
 this card contains the combos of the 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.050
 to prevent opponents or important 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.840
 bossmonster with very decisive 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.419
 to annul effects on you 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.770
 you do not have fear of the need it 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.030
 is just a handicap that can 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.680
 you can always use 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.479
 there are a lot of people all over 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.100
 just about every black I mean 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:11.600
 play 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:14.030
 I am not a type of the effect so often 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.169
 in heavy use but the card 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.720
 are bad you can do that on everyone 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.540
 Make a case is one of the best cards 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:23.090
 In june definitely is a brilliant hand 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.840
 rap that you can do in any crane 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:27.680
 but not necessary 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:29.120
 i want him to fall or type effect 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.680
 can explain you from many stupid ones 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.390
 Save the situation if the enemy 

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:33.729
 this monster has this against you 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:35.960
 completely destroy 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.040
 then you can explain without effect 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.260
 just nothing to do 

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.229
 or you can not beat the opponent's ek 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:44.479
 or anything else there are cards youview 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.640
 They simply by the effect 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:48.290
 can destroy and with effects 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.180
 Complainant can be used to avoid the 

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:52.870
 that's why the card is just awesome 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:54.880
 besides, she is also still one 

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.380
 receiver monster and in some decks 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.480
 can also be very important but 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.330
 primarily you play mostly because of that 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:02.410
 Handy perfect the last card for today 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.630
 Almost everyone is likely to know 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.700
 solemn judgment a prohibited account 

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:08.680
 fall with the effect if a monster 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.810
 would be summoned or a second fall 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.400
 Kartak worth half is in a 

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:13.630
 live points to all of her the summon 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.690
 or deactivation if you have this 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.550
 destroy the card at the ec card 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:20.980
 prohibited and not just limited 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:24.490
 or so I used to be half the 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:27.550
 lightest 4000 points at the start of the 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:31.050
 duels at least simply live 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:33.760
 Paying points is completely irrelevant 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:37.000
 live points are like money in dubio 

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.430
 you pay for your effects and that 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.620
 is not - but with solemn judgment 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:43.680
 can you just the most important effect 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.810
 of the opponent cancel in his round 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:49.480
 the most crucial of you break 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:52.180
 would and therefore is solemn 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.710
 Judgment a little too strong I would 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:56.620
 do not say that they are strictly prohibited 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.870
 but would have to be if now for example 

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.480
 situation have you already a while 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:04.150
 played and you are in round 15 or 

00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:06.430
 sony only has 1500 numbers left around 

00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:08.860
 to be able to annul something and 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.750
 even as a counter trap that is 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:13.030
 damn blatantly I have to say really 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:14.260
 Solemn judgment is rightly forbidden 

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.190
 maybe one of the cards 

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:16.510
 maybe again someday 

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:18.670
