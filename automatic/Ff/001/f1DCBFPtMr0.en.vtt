facebook I'm still jacked to give to the
Merseyside<00:00:04.589> dark<00:00:04.830> obviously<00:00:05.279> steven<00:00:05.730> is

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
Merseyside dark obviously steven is

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.210 
Merseyside dark obviously steven is
about<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.150> make<00:00:06.319> 700<00:00:07.319> appearances<00:00:07.799> but<00:00:07.980> you're

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
about to make 700 appearances but you're

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.339 
about to make 700 appearances but you're
managing<00:00:08.519> his<00:00:08.730> workload<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.900> obviously

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
managing his workload and obviously

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.720 
managing his workload and obviously
bring<00:00:10.559> it<00:00:10.679> down<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.920> storage<00:00:11.190> back<00:00:11.400> as<00:00:11.550> well

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
bring it down the storage back as well

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.910 
bring it down the storage back as well
so<00:00:12.000> how<00:00:12.330> much<00:00:12.450> focus<00:00:12.840> will<00:00:12.990> there<00:00:13.110> be<00:00:13.139> looking

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
so how much focus will there be looking

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.589 
so how much focus will there be looking
ahead<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.340> merseyside<00:00:14.759> derby<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.299> think

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
ahead to the merseyside derby I think

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.790 
ahead to the merseyside derby I think
when<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.750> have<00:00:15.870> so<00:00:16.049> many<00:00:16.170> games<00:00:16.440> you<00:00:17.060> have<00:00:18.060> to

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
when you have so many games you have to

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.070 
when you have so many games you have to
obviously<00:00:19.820> plan<00:00:20.820> forward<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.689> look<00:00:21.900> at<00:00:22.050> that

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
obviously plan forward and look at that

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.490 
obviously plan forward and look at that
but<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.949> always<00:00:23.730> believe<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.000> next<00:00:24.300> game<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.660> is

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
but I always believe the next game is is

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.320 
but I always believe the next game is is
very<00:00:25.590> important<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.400> I'll<00:00:26.880> always<00:00:27.029> pick<00:00:27.300> a

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
very important and I'll always pick a

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.359 
very important and I'll always pick a
team<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.599> think<00:00:27.750> can<00:00:28.170> come<00:00:28.590> on<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.830> game<00:00:29.010> as<00:00:29.310> I

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
players loving the fact that there are

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.080 
players loving the fact that there are
so<00:01:06.840> many<00:01:06.990> games<00:01:07.460> yet<00:01:08.460> because<00:01:08.700> it<00:01:08.820> means<00:01:08.939> that

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
we're in competitions and doing well I

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.310 
we're in competitions and doing well I
think<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> players<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.930> real<00:01:13.080> good

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
think the players on a real good

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.050 
think the players on a real good
physical<00:01:13.710> condition<00:01:13.740> I<00:01:14.250> think<00:01:14.460> that's<00:01:14.610> that's

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
physical condition I think that's that's

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.410 
physical condition I think that's that's
important<00:01:16.009> to<00:01:17.009> understand<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:18.299> know

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
play the games I just finally for me

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.620 
play the games I just finally for me
just<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.829> terms<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.250> injuries<00:01:56.759> in<00:01:56.909> general<00:01:57.329> and

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
just in terms of injuries in general and

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.450 
just in terms of injuries in general and
perhaps<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.140> reaction<00:01:58.710> of<00:01:58.770> how<00:01:58.920> daniel<00:01:59.340> has

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
perhaps the reaction of how daniel has

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
perhaps the reaction of how daniel has
been<00:01:59.640> since<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.090> match<00:02:00.240> as<00:02:00.450> well<00:02:00.630> Pingree<00:02:01.469> 'it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
been since the match as well Pingree 'it

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.520 
been since the match as well Pingree 'it
it's<00:02:02.040> i<00:02:02.430> think<00:02:02.909> it's<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.210> process<00:02:03.450> where<00:02:03.810> Daniel

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
it's i think it's a process where Daniel

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.600 
it's i think it's a process where Daniel
isn't<00:02:04.649> as<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.860> said<00:02:05.100> he's<00:02:05.189> been<00:02:05.280> out<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.430> long
