00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.760
 Y 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.099
 welcome to barista course 2 this is a 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.550
 intermediate barista course 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.820
 mainly hot drinks 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.490
 and we will try to talk about different 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.020
 combinations of drinks and how not 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:23.029
 it's just a matter of a 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.270
 recipe book but you have to serve follow 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.210
 the techniques of each of the 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.700
 machinery and equipment that we are using 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.500
 inside a cafeteria like that is that in 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.390
 this course you will develop your 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.030
 skills in a much more way 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.430
 deep to occupy the machine 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.920
 espresso not only in what you have 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.470
 what to do with coffee extraction, but 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.170
 in this video are you going to learn how 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.510
 It is also take milk and combine 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.050
 espresso and milk to get results 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.050
 phenomenal 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.850
 at barista level and administrator level 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.329
 of cafeterias it is very difficult to distinguish 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.290
 between the cappuccino and the latte let's say 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.240
 that the cappuccino one injects more air into 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.030
 the milk this means as we have 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.280
 commented that there is a greater presence of 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.409
 cream of milk or bubbles to put it 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.090
 well we do not want to talk about milk cream 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.119
 because its texture is a bubble 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.640
 small while in the late we're not going 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.590
 to inject so much air into the 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.200
 preparation but we're just going to 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.409
 try to have a thick milk milk 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.960
 that does not have so much air presence of 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:37.649
 way that what we want to see in this 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.270
 latte is a part of espresso and two 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.880
 milk parts 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:46.420
 this time we are going to see the barista 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:49.479
 do your preparation for espresso 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.070
 let's see the complete take and then 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.969
 let's see how it starts to take 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.799
 milk and what texture that smoothness looks for in 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:58.929
 this time the temperature of the 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.890
 Cappuccino and latex are very similar to 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:03.820
 milk level 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.710
 here while we see how 12 here 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.050
 blob to compress and it will extract 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:11.800
 we will also make an express 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.660
 double said me that the texture of the 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.630
 milk that makes all the difference of 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.370
 world it is important to mention that if not 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.510
 we get in the late the texture 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:25.270
 correct let's get that we can not 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.930
 draw in art we have commented that 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:32.370
 the latte art is to draw on the 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.780
 coffee and you get in tulips recipes 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.650
 good angels everyone can draw on 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.020
 the coffee in about 25 figures but what 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.080
 important here is to get the 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:47.709
 consistency that one wants you to 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.530
 realize the cappuccino we made has 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.560
 a kind of belly on top of that is why 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.690
 is achieved by the consistency of the end 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.060
 in the case of the latte we will not see it 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.040
 so we're already extracting 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:04.150
 our espresso with cream see that 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:07.239
 we are using cups of higher capacity 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.310
 we are using 8 ounce cups we are 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.180
 extracting normal expresses if we speak 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.750
 of the 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.420
 and we have our jug ​​a jar 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.129
 We have already commented on the video 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.080
 theoretical what are the measures of this 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:26.880
 pitcher we clean and we will proceed to 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:29.340
 and put the lancet into the milk and we're going to 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.790
 wait for a temperature to arrive and 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.790
 that does not expose too much 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:40.760
 then we are seeing how it is not going to 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.760
 so lift the milk 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:46.280
 and you create the right texture of if 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.060
 you realized in the cappuccino if 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.129
 that foam was created here we have a 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.560
 much more milk that is to say is a 

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:56.150
 more liquid consistency let's move on 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.209
 again let's see the barista how 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.480
 happens to have more control at the time 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.950
 of serving passes his milk to a pitcher 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.900
 little girl this time how are you going to 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:08.000
 serve 2 good as it is more much more 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.530
 controllable does not mean that this 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.700
 can do can be done if it's going to 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.480
 be a single cup of latte when it 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.480
 you can do this
