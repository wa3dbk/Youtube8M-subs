blizzard our heritage was actually
console<00:00:21.300> games<00:00:21.539> obviously<00:00:21.869> we've<00:00:22.590> been<00:00:22.770> away

console games obviously we've been away
for<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> while<00:00:23.310> so<00:00:24.090> we<00:00:24.420> had<00:00:24.570> a<00:00:24.600> little<00:00:24.750> bit<00:00:24.930> to

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
for a while so we had a little bit to

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.570 
for a while so we had a little bit to
learn<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.500> we<00:00:25.680> looked<00:00:25.949> across<00:00:26.070> all<00:00:26.490> the

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
learn and we looked across all the

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.609 
learn and we looked across all the
franchise's<00:00:27.330> to<00:00:27.600> see<00:00:27.810> you<00:00:28.140> know<00:00:28.230> which<00:00:28.410> one

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
franchise's to see you know which one

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.290 
franchise's to see you know which one
would<00:00:28.800> really<00:00:29.220> be<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.519> most<00:00:29.699> appropriate<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
would really be the most appropriate to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.899 
would really be the most appropriate to
bring<00:00:30.390> across<00:00:30.689> and<00:00:31.650> we<00:00:31.830> felt<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.129> Diablo<00:00:32.699> was

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:32.909 
bring across and we felt that Diablo was

00:00:32.909 --> 00:00:36.319 
bring across and we felt that Diablo was
was<00:00:33.269> by<00:00:33.510> far<00:00:33.539> the<00:00:34.199> easiest<00:00:34.769> win<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.639> is<00:00:35.940> the

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
was by far the easiest win it is the

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.479 
was by far the easiest win it is the
granddaddy<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.109> action<00:00:37.589> RPGs<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.280> know<00:00:38.370> when

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:40.319 
the first one came out the late 90s I

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:42.079 
the first one came out the late 90s I
really<00:00:40.559> said<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:41.039> know<00:00:41.100> RPGs<00:00:41.370> don't<00:00:41.879> need<00:00:41.969> to

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089 
really said you know RPGs don't need to

00:00:42.089 --> 00:00:45.559 
really said you know RPGs don't need to
be<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.809> slow<00:00:43.229> so<00:00:43.739> pondering<00:00:44.339> epic<00:00:45.059> they<00:00:45.389> can

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:45.569 
be this slow so pondering epic they can

00:00:45.569 --> 00:00:47.809 
be this slow so pondering epic they can
be<00:00:45.659> these<00:00:45.780> awesome<00:00:46.019> you<00:00:46.829> know<00:00:46.859> rock<00:00:47.190> concerts

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
things and kill a bunch of monsters and

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.669 
things and kill a bunch of monsters and

connects<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.429> that<00:00:53.579> experience<00:00:54.269> and<00:00:54.479> I

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
connects you to that experience and I

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.119 
connects you to that experience and I
think<00:00:54.719> it's<00:00:54.839> super<00:00:55.440> important<00:00:55.859> for<00:00:55.889> us<00:00:56.100> that

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
think it's super important for us that

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.099 
think it's super important for us that
the<00:00:56.339> player<00:00:56.549> feels<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.089> they<00:00:57.239> are<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
the player feels that they are in the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.899 
the player feels that they are in the
screen<00:00:58.440> with<00:00:58.889> their<00:00:59.159> with<00:00:59.429> their<00:00:59.519> character

00:00:59.899 --> 00:00:59.909 
screen with their with their character

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:02.149 
screen with their with their character
and<00:00:59.940> partly<00:01:00.839> because<00:01:00.989> our<00:01:01.589> players<00:01:01.889> on

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:02.159 
and partly because our players on

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.759 
and partly because our players on
console<00:01:02.819> are<00:01:03.029> sitting<00:01:03.359> 10<00:01:03.839> to<00:01:04.229> 15<00:01:04.530> feet<00:01:04.649> away

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
console are sitting 10 to 15 feet away

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.529 
console are sitting 10 to 15 feet away
from<00:01:05.009> the<00:01:05.100> action<00:01:05.430> so<00:01:05.609> the<00:01:05.939> more<00:01:06.149> we<00:01:06.180> can<00:01:06.420> make

00:01:06.529 --> 00:01:06.539 
from the action so the more we can make

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:08.120 
from the action so the more we can make
them<00:01:06.659> feel<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.899> they<00:01:07.140> are<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.649> action<00:01:07.979> they

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
them feel that they are the action they

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.279 
them feel that they are the action they
are<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.460> Barbarian<00:01:08.969> the<00:01:09.479> more<00:01:09.689> epic<00:01:10.109> and

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:10.289 
are the Barbarian the more epic and

00:01:10.289 --> 00:01:12.529 
are the Barbarian the more epic and
visceral<00:01:10.649> experiences<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.789> for<00:01:12.030> us<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.359> thing

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539 
visceral experiences so for us the thing

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:14.480 
visceral experiences so for us the thing
that's<00:01:12.719> exciting<00:01:13.140> about<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.560> new<00:01:13.680> console<00:01:14.219> is

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
that's exciting about the new console is

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.880 
that's exciting about the new console is
actually<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.210> controller<00:01:15.630> that's<00:01:16.619> where<00:01:16.799> it

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
actually the controller that's where it

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.099 
actually the controller that's where it
all<00:01:16.950> begins<00:01:17.310> that's<00:01:17.820> where<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.509> develop<00:01:18.750> that

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:19.109 
all begins that's where you develop that

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:20.749 
all begins that's where you develop that
relationship<00:01:19.380> with<00:01:19.979> your<00:01:20.100> character<00:01:20.490> on<00:01:20.609> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
relationship with your character on the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
screen you know I blizzard we have this

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.399 
screen you know I blizzard we have this
or<00:01:23.310> philosophy<00:01:23.939> that<00:01:24.090> control<00:01:24.570> is<00:01:24.750> king<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
elbow three for us that means the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.310 
elbow three for us that means the

a<00:01:31.380> mouse<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:32.100> is<00:01:32.249> something<00:01:32.369> different<00:01:32.520> for

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
a mouse this is something different for

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.279 
a mouse this is something different for
us<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.210> it's<00:01:33.420> something<00:01:33.539> exciting<00:01:34.109> that<00:01:34.140> we

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:34.289 
us and it's something exciting that we

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:35.389 
us and it's something exciting that we
haven't<00:01:34.530> had<00:01:34.649> a<00:01:34.679> chance<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.950> work<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.249> on

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
haven't had a chance to work with on

haven't had a chance to work with on
Diablo<00:01:35.789> what<00:01:36.149> was<00:01:36.270> surprising<00:01:36.390> was<00:01:36.780> that<00:01:36.929> the

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
Diablo what was surprising was that the

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.050 
Diablo what was surprising was that the
second<00:01:37.740> I<00:01:37.859> got<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.130> controller<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:38.640> my<00:01:38.759> hand<00:01:38.939> and

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
second I got a controller in my hand and

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.669 
second I got a controller in my hand and
started<00:01:39.329> playing<00:01:39.630> around<00:01:39.749> and<00:01:40.079> there's<00:01:40.590> a

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
started playing around and there's a

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:42.499 
started playing around and there's a
difference<00:01:40.799> here<00:01:41.159> between<00:01:41.189> an<00:01:42.119> indirect

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
difference here between an indirect

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.849 
difference here between an indirect
control<00:01:42.719> where<00:01:43.020> I'm<00:01:43.140> pointing<00:01:43.319> around<00:01:43.560> with<00:01:43.799> a

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
control where I'm pointing around with a

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
intentional control where I say I'm

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.069 
intentional control where I say I'm
planning<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.119> way<00:01:48.299> I'm<00:01:48.420> attacking<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.929> way

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
planning this way I'm attacking that way

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.230 
planning this way I'm attacking that way
I'm<00:01:49.200> rolling<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.649> way<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.039> that<00:01:50.069> just<00:01:50.939> sings

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
I'm rolling this way and that just sings

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.179 
I'm rolling this way and that just sings
it<00:01:51.569> was<00:01:51.719> really<00:01:52.079> surprising<00:01:52.590> even<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:52.979> me

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
it was really surprising even to me

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.039 
it was really surprising even to me
there's<00:01:53.640> an<00:01:53.819> intimate<00:01:54.420> connection<00:01:54.569> between

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
there's an intimate connection between

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.899 
there's an intimate connection between
the<00:01:55.409> player<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.799> their<00:01:56.280> character<00:01:56.729> and

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
the player and their character and

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.969 
the player and their character and
that's<00:01:57.240> something<00:01:57.659> that<00:01:57.810> we<00:01:58.020> really<00:01:58.049> wanted

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that's something that we really wanted

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.559 
that's something that we really wanted
to<00:01:59.039> leverage<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.909> build<00:02:00.539> the<00:02:00.990> free<00:02:01.950> version

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
to leverage and build the free version

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.539 
to leverage and build the free version
for<00:02:03.569> the<00:02:03.600> console<00:02:04.049> specifically<00:02:04.740> around<00:02:05.009> the

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
for the console specifically around the

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.910 
for the console specifically around the
notion<00:02:05.700> that<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:06.060> call<00:02:06.240> pickup<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.990> slay<00:02:07.229> so

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
notion that we call pickup and slay so

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.339 
notion that we call pickup and slay so
on<00:02:08.239> console<00:02:09.239> we<00:02:09.479> will<00:02:09.629> make<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.959> DualShock

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349

really well one of the things that we're
excited<00:02:42.519> about<00:02:42.849> with<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.120> controller<00:02:43.569> is<00:02:43.840> the

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
excited about with the controller is the

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.470 
excited about with the controller is the
touch<00:02:44.319> pad<00:02:44.590> Diablo<00:02:45.310> is<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.459> pretty<00:02:45.849> deep<00:02:46.180> game

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
touch pad Diablo is a pretty deep game

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.900 
touch pad Diablo is a pretty deep game
and<00:02:46.780> we<00:02:47.680> don't<00:02:47.799> like<00:02:48.069> a<00:02:48.099> lot<00:02:48.340> of<00:02:48.370> overload<00:02:48.880> on

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
and we don't like a lot of overload on

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.160 
and we don't like a lot of overload on
the<00:02:49.120> buttons<00:02:49.420> we<00:02:49.569> wanted<00:02:49.840> to<00:02:49.870> keep<00:02:49.989> it<00:02:50.110> really

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
the buttons we wanted to keep it really

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.839 
the buttons we wanted to keep it really
simple<00:02:50.410> so<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:50.950> can<00:02:51.069> get<00:02:51.190> to<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.459> things<00:02:51.670> that

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
simple so you can get to the things that

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:53.490 
simple so you can get to the things that
you<00:02:51.940> need<00:02:52.060> to<00:02:52.180> get<00:02:52.299> too<00:02:52.420> fast<00:02:52.780> because<00:02:53.049> you

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
you need to get too fast because you

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.110 
you need to get too fast because you
need<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.769> do<00:02:53.860> it<00:02:53.980> because<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.519> monsters<00:02:54.970> are

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
need to do it because the monsters are

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.670 
need to do it because the monsters are
poor<00:02:55.480> and<00:02:55.569> actually<00:02:55.870> no<00:02:55.959> matter<00:02:56.110> what<00:02:56.379> we

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
poor and actually no matter what we

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.110 
poor and actually no matter what we
think<00:02:56.709> the<00:02:57.040> touchpad<00:02:57.400> is<00:02:57.549> going<00:02:57.670> to<00:02:57.730> give<00:02:57.879> us<00:02:57.910> a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
think the touchpad is going to give us a

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.420 
think the touchpad is going to give us a
lot<00:02:58.299> more<00:02:58.620> opportunity<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.650> make<00:03:00.250> that

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
lot more opportunity to make that

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.580 
lot more opportunity to make that
interface<00:03:00.849> a<00:03:00.879> lot<00:03:01.209> easier<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:02.260> know<00:03:02.349> we<00:03:02.470> now

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
interface a lot easier you know we now

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.289 
interface a lot easier you know we now
have<00:03:02.860> a<00:03:02.890> different<00:03:03.459> way<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.940> the<00:03:04.030> player<00:03:04.269> can

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
have a different way that the player can

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.600 
have a different way that the player can
interact<00:03:05.079> with<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.560> game<00:03:05.590> for<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.430> game<00:03:06.579> like

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
interact with the game for a game like

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.550 
interact with the game for a game like
the<00:03:06.879> apples<00:03:07.180> me<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.629> has<00:03:07.720> a<00:03:07.750> lot<00:03:07.959> of<00:03:08.019> sort<00:03:08.530> of

exciting<00:03:14.620> and<00:03:14.739> really<00:03:14.950> can't<00:03:15.310> wait<00:03:15.430> to<00:03:15.549> dive

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
exciting and really can't wait to dive

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.940 
exciting and really can't wait to dive
into<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.180> sort<00:03:16.359> of<00:03:16.389> make<00:03:16.870> it<00:03:16.900> as<00:03:17.139> awesome<00:03:17.650> as

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
into and sort of make it as awesome as

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.160 
into and sort of make it as awesome as
we<00:03:18.069> can<00:03:18.280> what<00:03:19.180> we<00:03:19.299> didn't<00:03:19.569> want<00:03:19.720> to<00:03:19.780> do<00:03:19.959> is

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.170 
we can what we didn't want to do is

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.650 
we can what we didn't want to do is
simplify<00:03:21.130> the<00:03:21.700> experience<00:03:22.180> because<00:03:22.450> at<00:03:22.569> the

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
simplify the experience because at the

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.240 
simplify the experience because at the
end<00:03:22.690> of<00:03:22.810> the<00:03:22.900> day<00:03:23.079> the<00:03:23.590> elbow<00:03:23.829> is<00:03:23.889> awesome

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
end of the day the elbow is awesome

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.740 
end of the day the elbow is awesome
because<00:03:24.400> of<00:03:24.609> all<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:25.000> different<00:03:25.269> items<00:03:25.600> you

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
because of all the different items you

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.479 
because of all the different items you
can<00:03:25.870> get<00:03:26.079> and<00:03:26.440> all<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.889> different<00:03:27.160> powers

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
can get and all the different powers

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.039 
can get and all the different powers
those<00:03:27.670> items<00:03:27.880> have<00:03:28.180> so<00:03:28.510> we<00:03:28.630> didn't<00:03:28.870> want<00:03:28.989> to

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
those items have so we didn't want to

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.460 
those items have so we didn't want to
sacrifice<00:03:29.260> that<00:03:29.769> what<00:03:30.340> we<00:03:30.519> wanted<00:03:30.970> to<00:03:31.030> do<00:03:31.239> is

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
sacrifice that what we wanted to do is

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.050 
sacrifice that what we wanted to do is
streamline<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.799> experience<00:03:33.340> so<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:33.819> players

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
streamline the experience so the players

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.170 
streamline the experience so the players
can<00:03:34.269> decide<00:03:34.630> when<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.530> how<00:03:35.620> they<00:03:36.400> wanted<00:03:36.790> that

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
can decide when and how they wanted that

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.449 
can decide when and how they wanted that
level<00:03:37.420> of<00:03:37.480> information<00:03:38.079> so<00:03:38.829> we<00:03:38.950> really<00:03:39.130> built

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
level of information so we really built

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.580 
level of information so we really built
the<00:03:39.730> inventory<00:03:40.389> and<00:03:40.660> all<00:03:41.049> are<00:03:41.349> you<00:03:41.470> are

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
the inventory and all are you are

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:43.229 
the inventory and all are you are
screens<00:03:41.980> from<00:03:42.160> the<00:03:42.310> ground<00:03:42.519> up<00:03:42.669> these<00:03:43.060> are

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
screens from the ground up these are

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.640 
screens from the ground up these are
screens<00:03:43.480> are<00:03:43.599> specifically<00:03:44.079> designed<00:03:44.230> to

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
screens are specifically designed to

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.530 
screens are specifically designed to
feel<00:03:44.950> great<00:03:45.220> when<00:03:45.519> you<00:03:45.639> have<00:03:45.790> a<00:03:45.849> duel<00:03:46.180> shark<00:03:46.359> in

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
feel great when you have a duel shark in

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.210 
feel great when you have a duel shark in
your<00:03:46.660> hands<00:03:46.989> in<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.410> way<00:03:47.530> you<00:03:47.590> navigate<00:03:48.099> them

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
your hands in the way you navigate them

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.339 
your hands in the way you navigate them
so<00:03:48.400> we<00:03:48.819> moved<00:03:49.030> into<00:03:49.239> a<00:03:49.359> radial<00:03:49.750> style<00:03:50.079> menu

00:03:50.339 --> 00:03:50.349 
so we moved into a radial style menu

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:51.930 
so we moved into a radial style menu
that<00:03:50.709> allows<00:03:50.799> first<00:03:51.280> of<00:03:51.400> all<00:03:51.489> your<00:03:51.609> character

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
that allows first of all your character

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.879 
that allows first of all your character
be<00:03:52.060> nice<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.389> big<00:03:52.540> on<00:03:52.660> screen<00:03:53.079> where<00:03:53.769> they

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:53.889 
be nice and big on screen where they

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.550 
be nice and big on screen where they
were<00:03:53.980> the<00:03:54.040> magic<00:03:54.669> of<00:03:54.930> working<00:03:55.930> on<00:03:56.049> the<00:03:56.440> game

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
were the magic of working on the game

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.740 
were the magic of working on the game
like<00:03:56.709> Diablo<00:03:57.160> at<00:03:57.310> blizzard<00:03:57.880> is<00:03:58.120> we're<00:03:58.540> very

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
iterative like we constantly keep asking

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:01.860 
iterative like we constantly keep asking
yourself<00:04:00.849> how<00:04:00.940> can<00:04:00.970> we<00:04:01.180> make<00:04:01.299> this<00:04:01.359> better<00:04:01.720> how

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870

that<00:05:21.280> that<00:05:21.400> share<00:05:22.300> button<00:05:22.330> I<00:05:22.900> think<00:05:23.199> has<00:05:23.319> this

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
that that share button I think has this

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.399 
that that share button I think has this
potential<00:05:24.430> to<00:05:24.669> so<00:05:25.479> really<00:05:25.750> fundamentally

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409 
potential to so really fundamentally

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:30.540 
potential to so really fundamentally
change<00:05:26.800> the<00:05:27.069> way<00:05:27.250> players<00:05:28.440> interact<00:05:29.440> with<00:05:29.889> not

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:30.550 
change the way players interact with not

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.219 
change the way players interact with not
just<00:05:30.580> the<00:05:30.789> game<00:05:31.030> but<00:05:31.270> with<00:05:31.419> one<00:05:31.630> another<00:05:31.900> and

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
just the game but with one another and

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.740 
just the game but with one another and
there's<00:05:33.190> always<00:05:33.400> been<00:05:33.490> a<00:05:33.550> barrier<00:05:34.240> to<00:05:34.419> sort<00:05:34.719> of

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
there's always been a barrier to sort of

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:36.120 
there's always been a barrier to sort of
bring<00:05:34.900> that<00:05:34.960> same<00:05:35.229> type<00:05:35.409> of<00:05:35.440> experience<00:05:36.039> with

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.130 
bring that same type of experience with

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:38.189 
bring that same type of experience with
a<00:05:36.219> console<00:05:36.699> but<00:05:37.210> the<00:05:37.300> fact<00:05:37.539> that<00:05:37.630> it's<00:05:37.870> now<00:05:37.990> on

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819 
your controller a button press a way

it not just with their friends on your

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.830 
it not just with their friends on your
couch<00:05:45.130> but<00:05:45.370> with<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.550> whole<00:05:45.729> world<00:05:46.060> the<00:05:46.599> fact

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:46.840 
couch but with the whole world the fact

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:48.570 
couch but with the whole world the fact
that<00:05:46.900> that's<00:05:47.110> a<00:05:47.199> button<00:05:47.409> press<00:05:47.650> away<00:05:47.979> it's

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:48.580 
that that's a button press away it's

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.999 
that that's a button press away it's
just<00:05:48.729> such<00:05:48.849> a<00:05:48.880> such<00:05:49.449> a<00:05:49.479> great<00:05:50.110> thing<00:05:50.650> to<00:05:50.680> bring

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
just such a such a great thing to bring

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:52.800 
just such a such a great thing to bring
two<00:05:51.190> players<00:05:51.430> and<00:05:51.729> I<00:05:51.789> think<00:05:51.819> it's<00:05:52.120> one<00:05:52.690> of

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
two players and I think it's one of

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:53.850 
two players and I think it's one of
those<00:05:52.900> things<00:05:52.960> that<00:05:53.139> especially<00:05:53.650> when<00:05:53.770> we

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:53.860 
those things that especially when we

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:55.170 
those things that especially when we
start<00:05:54.069> talking<00:05:54.219> about<00:05:54.490> it<00:05:54.699> and<00:05:54.819> sort<00:05:55.090> of

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180 
start talking about it and sort of

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.059 
start talking about it and sort of
internally<00:05:55.659> is<00:05:55.779> that<00:05:55.930> we<00:05:56.469> sort<00:05:56.650> of<00:05:56.710> get<00:05:56.889> that

00:05:57.059 --> 00:05:57.069 
internally is that we sort of get that

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.559 
internally is that we sort of get that
potential<00:05:57.639> but<00:05:57.819> it's<00:05:57.940> not<00:05:58.090> until<00:05:58.330> we<00:05:58.449> actually

00:05:58.559 --> 00:05:58.569 
potential but it's not until we actually

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:00.390 
potential but it's not until we actually
see<00:05:59.050> it<00:05:59.139> in<00:05:59.289> action<00:05:59.469> and<00:05:59.889> more<00:06:00.069> importantly

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:00.400 
see it in action and more importantly

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.640 
see it in action and more importantly
see<00:06:00.580> players<00:06:01.270> engage<00:06:01.870> with<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.199> and<00:06:02.349> see<00:06:02.560> what

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:02.650 
see players engage with it and see what

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:04.260 
see players engage with it and see what
they<00:06:02.770> do<00:06:02.830> with<00:06:02.949> it<00:06:03.250> that's<00:06:03.880> where<00:06:04.060> we're<00:06:04.150> going

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
they do with it that's where we're going

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.300 
they do with it that's where we're going
to<00:06:04.330> see<00:06:04.539> the<00:06:05.050> true<00:06:05.259> promise<00:06:05.860> of<00:06:06.009> that<00:06:06.159> share
