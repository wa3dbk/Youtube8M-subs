00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.530
 to lorient with who what is happening in anna world 

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.710
 he says no the story begins to valentin the young physicist is a 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.029
 job that does not go to the terminal 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:15.159
 % and I dropped the experience 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:18.339
 quite happy 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:21.449
 and during that time on the outside the walk which is clear 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.449
 with lightning the lightning falls in the cyclotron 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.429
 next 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:32.240
 for good food 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.240
 brutal arrival it comes under water it surfaces 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.760
 darrious guy brandon without decorum desertines 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.840
 with 40 years qualifying who are suffering 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 he'll have to face creatures 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.150
 we dare not even anymore because otherwise I defended sees the hole of the game is a 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.290
 adventure game of course yes I surrender you actions of this childhood to 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.170
 this gestique day yes and then 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.860
 of hope on letters develop sales 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.310
 so how did that happen to create these animations 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.710
 so I used 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.710
 a technique called her girlfriend rests 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.500
 astronauts began to m perfume actors is stopped 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.030
 really too much 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.300
 and then 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.300
 % to judge what involves a video camera 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.030
 more than video camera parts 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.650
 an average computer using an interface I call does not bother me 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.659
 guarantee that you can see them simultaneously on the screen 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.290
 and video imagery for surrounding villages at age 48 sean penn amancic 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.520
 frame by frame I recalculated 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.670
 all movements 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.650
 animal compounds as if you had decided every move 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.880
 johra kaleki daegu what I know of her in the big towers more 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.540
 redesigned behind the cac shape 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.490
 the construction of this date 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.380
 some series that a video camera and therefore very innovative if he wins 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.030
 time 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.720
 eloquent for the car that designed the car 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.470
 then show it is a reduced model 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.860
 sÃ¼d-chemie reaching it at arid soil level i launched the car against 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.240
 a wall where I bawled gold counts it was a band 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.610
 against skids like that 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.770
 and then 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.770
 I have some escaped 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:14.589
 the problem of these animations is that it takes such an extraordinary place 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.609
 that's what I used 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.229
 a technique 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:21.229
 animation based on polygons heading 

00:02:23.669 --> 00:02:27.829
 unlike the so-called technique but a little late but a good of 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:30.429
 memory quite 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:34.199
 the colossal success the others is an animation that takes a few places except 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.329
 than ten cases since you know so a floppy disk has a place 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:40.629
 the content a little bit like a speech could not put 50 songs 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.769
 normal that five or six turns is a bit the same as the one on amiga that 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.149
 pretty much 

00:02:45.149 --> 00:02:46.839
 840 

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:50.079
 and the production of the game that rum almost three months 

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:54.699
 birth slope changes to understand the effects of an hour that 

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:56.059
 takes 64 pounds 

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:58.559
 and in addition the data without makeup 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:01.519
 completing with the seats at the latest news the sharp ports 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:04.519
 french first was done 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:08.479
 2 use legal deposits did not use the sites 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.519
 the polygons is gaining space but less with these polyphonies can 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.479
 was losing animations 

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:17.439
 who take all the screen and close-ups of the lights and I designed the 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:18.899
 scenario 

00:03:18.899 --> 00:03:19.939
 in this light
