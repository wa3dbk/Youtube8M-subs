00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
 hi hello how about friends today i'm going 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.690
 to talk about the cost of a couple of 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.320
 lenses here in canada 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:17.189
 it turns out and it happens that my son and my wife 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.890
 they wear glasses so more or less every year 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.770
 you have to be changing them and I'm fine 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.230
 aware about the matter because I guess 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:29.780
 who is the one who pays good 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:32.420
 and it turns out that a pair of lenses 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.890
 with prescription no sunglasses no if yes 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:36.320
 Our lenses that need the 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.710
 people to see a pair of glasses 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.540
 these including the saddle including 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:48.500
 the exam is worth about 230 dollars 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:50.079
 that is the standard the standard lens 230 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.690
 Dollars 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.699
 as everywhere there are promotions and 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.570
 you're just going to buy the saddle you're worth 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:01:02.109
 200 dollars and if you are going to buy only 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.820
 the glasses are worth 200 dollars but if 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.009
 you buy the mount and the lenses 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.560
 well the glasses are worth 200 dollars and 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.080
 the mount a dollar 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.840
 Also if you buy special lenses 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.939
 no specials a few more lenses 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.659
 expensive that are more or less 300 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:23.380
 dollars for one more dollar more they give you 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:26.020
 a pair of additional lenses or another 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:29.049
 pair of glasses this is more or less what 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.490
 happens in my country also here here is 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:34.569
 Where have I seen this in my country? 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.450
 the same thing also happens recently 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.520
 I was in Colombia and I was with my 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.459
 son and taking advantage of the walk I decided 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.979
 go through an optician so that you 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:46.899
 did an exam to my son and buy him 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:49.240
 new glasses a pair of glasses 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.670
 transitions transitions are these 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.140
 lenses that when the sun comes it 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.670
 darken they become like dark glasses 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.920
 like these or better like these and when 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.840
 light comes when when there is little light 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.560
 it becomes clear they are completely 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.720
 transparent 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:13.050
 these lenses cost 436 thousand pesos and not 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.040
 I'm wrong that is the equivalent to 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.040
 Is the equivalent 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.000
 to roughly 215 dollars 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:29.670
 that is, the lenses in Latin America 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.950
 are literally half of what 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.310
 are worth what many people do 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.190
 is that they go here they pay $ 30 they 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.050
 they do the eye exam and send money 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.180
 to your relatives or your friends in your 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:44.610
 countries of origin so that you already 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.170
 send your glasses first because the 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.550
 find at half price and 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.380
 second because with what one could 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.690
 buy here a pair of normal lenses 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.560
 in a country like Colombia or any 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.319
 other I'm sure can buy glasses 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:01.319
 finest know transition the use of 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.140
 transitions lenses here is almost that a 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.630
 luxury is to say I am sure that in the 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:08.100
 my son's school there is no other child or 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.910
 even a teacher who has these 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.950
 lenses 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.940
 that I do not know how much they are worth here but I think 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.010
 that is worth more or less 700 800 dollars 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.450
 surely worth more than an iphone and 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.550
 course to the people between a couple of 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.910
 nobody glasses and an iphone then prefer 

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.310
 the iphone that is here in canada as is 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:31.790
 it turns out that my son brought these 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:34.920
 lenses and his mom 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.020
 he sat on top 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:42.660
 the mother of my son 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.660
 has a bit of overweight matches 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.440
 they are broken 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.570
 that is to say 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:53.880
 my son lasted here 15 days with his glasses 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.880
 until his mom crushed them 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.840
 it turns out that we are looking for some 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.180
 a mount because the lenses also 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.730
 the crystals are good what is 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.320
 damaged is the saddle we are looking for 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:15.390
 a mount that goes where possible 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.390
 can use continue to use them 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:22.010
 these lenses these objects seems to be 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.950
 that there is no I did not realize in 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:29.210
 colombia these lenses looked normal 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:31.130
 that is, my friend liked the one he chose 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:33.830
 the mount is this mount 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.690
 my daughter was a normal size 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.490
 chose the mount but it turns out that here 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:41.300
 in channel everything is great I already had them 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:43.430
 talked enough look when one just 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.440
 there comes one note the difference but they pass 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.000
 day and do not start as like 

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:50.210
 one forgets how one loses the 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.740
 notion of space quickie and it results 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.900
 I do not know if you know it but 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:56.780
 let's put a car a car a mazda3 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.880
 a mazda3 here in canada is wider and 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.440
 it's longer happens with all the 

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.720
 cars passes with parking lots 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.150
 happens with the apartments happens with everything 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.580
 here everything is bigger including 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.910
 glasses these glasses that in my country were from 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.300
 normal size this saddle that in my country 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:15.120
 was 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.099
 of a standard normal size it turns out that 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:20.430
 here they are small that is to say I have 

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:23.759
 difficulty finding glasses and 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.759
 mounts here where you can include 

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:28.590
 these these crystals is to say I need 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.990
 a mount that is identical or that is 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.300
 a little smaller to send to carve 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.720
 the glass and I can put it in there 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:38.909
 as I have searched everywhere I have 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:41.250
 gone to five places where they sell 

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:44.220
 lenses and I have not found all the 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.129
 lenses are all frames are more 

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.990
 great as it finally I think I'm going 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:51.570
 to have to 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.340
 charged Colombia another pair of for the 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:54.800
 mount as it is identical this is the 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:56.750
 same 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.909
 and possibly another pair of glasses 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.139
 spare parts in case my son's mom 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:02.139
 return to sit on them 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.760
 as it is clear I am not I am separated 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:12.790
 I do not live with my son's mom 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:15.700
 because if anything but good 

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.580
 you already know a pair of lenses here standard 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.440
 normalitos are worth 230 dollars if you already 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.680
 he wants some glasses 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:26.250
 I do not know more advanced more modern more 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.250
 costly 

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:34.169
 more luxurious you can be worth 500 700 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:36.090
 dollars and then you will know if 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.180
 are in Latin America possibly a 

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.220
 pair of lenses there is literally worth the 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.840
 half the price ie 100 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:47.160
 dollars can I buy some lenses that 

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:48.870
 here they are worth 230 dollars and 430 dollars 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:54.669
 I can buy some lenses that are worth here 

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:59.840
 500 600 700 dollars so you already know 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:03.850
