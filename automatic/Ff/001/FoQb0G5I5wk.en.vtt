above 200 horsepower and then we were

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.090 
above 200 horsepower and then we were
sinking<00:01:12.780> looking<00:01:13.780> at<00:01:13.900> our<00:01:14.020> portfolio<00:01:14.710> what<00:01:14.950> to

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
sinking looking at our portfolio what to

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.130 
sinking looking at our portfolio what to
do

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
do

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.020 
do
coincidentally<00:01:17.140> the<00:01:17.590> the<00:01:18.040> previous<00:01:18.610> Astra

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
coincidentally the the previous Astra

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.580 
coincidentally the the previous Astra
OPC<00:01:19.150> faced<00:01:19.869> out<00:01:20.140> of<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.549> portfolio<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.439> then

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
OPC faced out of the portfolio and then

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.880 
OPC faced out of the portfolio and then
we<00:01:23.740> said<00:01:23.890> okay<00:01:24.159> if<00:01:24.310> we<00:01:24.460> go<00:01:24.610> for<00:01:24.850> more<00:01:24.880> power<00:01:25.570> and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
we said okay if we go for more power and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.240 
we said okay if we go for more power and
more<00:01:26.890> performance<00:01:28.530> we<00:01:29.530> will<00:01:29.770> add<00:01:29.950> some<00:01:30.189> more

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
more performance we will add some more

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.450 
more performance we will add some more
ingredients<00:01:30.610> in<00:01:31.390> order<00:01:31.630> to<00:01:31.990> make<00:01:32.740> the<00:01:33.040> ride

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 
ingredients in order to make the ride

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:40.920 
ingredients in order to make the ride
and<00:01:33.610> handling<00:01:33.970> even<00:01:34.180> better

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.730 

actually<00:01:41.170> we<00:01:41.350> haven't<00:01:41.920> done<00:01:42.250> a<00:01:42.600> separate

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
actually we haven't done a separate

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.010 
actually we haven't done a separate
complete<00:01:44.740> lap<00:01:45.100> as<00:01:45.370> we<00:01:46.270> did<00:01:46.450> with<00:01:46.630> there<00:01:46.900> was

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
complete lap as we did with there was

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.630 
complete lap as we did with there was
the<00:01:47.140> previous<00:01:47.380> car<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:47.950> only<00:01:48.070> thing<00:01:48.310> I<00:01:48.430> can

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
the previous car the only thing I can

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.630 
the previous car the only thing I can
tell<00:01:48.850> you<00:01:49.060> it's<00:01:49.380> faster<00:01:50.380> from<00:01:50.560> 0<00:01:50.770> to<00:01:50.950> 100<00:01:51.340> it's

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
tell you it's faster from 0 to 100 it's

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.120 
tell you it's faster from 0 to 100 it's
better<00:01:52.180> in<00:01:52.420> fifth<00:01:52.750> gear<00:01:53.170> acceleration<00:01:54.010> from

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
better in fifth gear acceleration from

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.460 
better in fifth gear acceleration from
80<00:01:54.400> to<00:01:54.580> 120<00:01:54.910> and<00:01:55.240> it's<00:01:55.450> a<00:01:55.510> better<00:01:55.720> top<00:01:55.960> speed

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
80 to 120 and it's a better top speed

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.460 
80 to 120 and it's a better top speed
finally<00:01:57.460> traction<00:01:58.360> is<00:01:58.479> significantly

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
finally traction is significantly

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.730 
finally traction is significantly
improved<00:01:59.950> with<00:02:00.720> limited<00:02:01.720> slip<00:02:01.960> differential

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
improved with limited slip differential

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.340 
improved with limited slip differential
and<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:04.090> brakes<00:02:04.360> are<00:02:04.479> better<00:02:04.690> so<00:02:04.900> all<00:02:05.110> the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
and the brakes are better so all the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.430 
and the brakes are better so all the
ingredients<00:02:05.890> are<00:02:06.010> there<00:02:06.040> we<00:02:06.869> haven't<00:02:07.869> really

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
ingredients are there we haven't really

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:14.890 
ingredients are there we haven't really
measured<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:09.009> yet

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900

meters of torque will be will be
significantly<00:05:48.669> improved<00:05:49.150> but<00:05:49.479> over<00:05:49.690> there<00:05:50.020> we

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
significantly improved but over there we

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:55.469 
significantly improved but over there we
haven't<00:05:50.740> done<00:05:50.889> a<00:05:52.139> lap<00:05:53.580> so<00:05:54.580> far<00:05:54.850> we<00:05:55.030> didn't<00:05:55.360> have

00:05:55.469 --> 00:05:55.479 
haven't done a lap so far we didn't have

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:58.140 
haven't done a lap so far we didn't have
the<00:05:55.660> time<00:05:55.870> and<00:05:56.169> the<00:05:56.560> environment<00:05:57.550> to<00:05:57.699> to<00:05:57.970> give

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
the time and the environment to to give

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.760 
the time and the environment to to give
that<00:05:58.330> a<00:05:58.360> try

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.300 

the<00:06:04.860> challenge<00:06:05.310> I<00:06:05.550> I<00:06:06.090> don't<00:06:06.539> know<00:06:06.660> but<00:06:07.310> we

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
the challenge I I don't know but we

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:17.610 
the challenge I I don't know but we
might<00:06:08.610> at<00:06:08.910> a<00:06:08.970> time<00:06:09.389> give<00:06:09.690> it<00:06:09.780> a<00:06:09.870> try

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:21.810 

it's<00:06:18.340> a<00:06:18.580> it's<00:06:18.940> an<00:06:19.060> interesting<00:06:19.360> question<00:06:20.820> but

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
it's a it's an interesting question but

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:26.340 
it's a it's an interesting question but
there<00:06:22.090> we<00:06:22.270> may<00:06:22.900> or<00:06:23.820> experience<00:06:24.820> at<00:06:25.090> NASA<00:06:25.350> Farah

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:26.350 
there we may or experience at NASA Farah

a<00:06:26.910> OPC<00:06:27.910> was<00:06:28.180> a<00:06:28.210> stunning<00:06:28.570> success<00:06:30.840> we<00:06:31.840> did<00:06:31.990> the

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
a OPC was a stunning success we did the

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.540 
a OPC was a stunning success we did the
Sofia<00:06:32.500> be<00:06:32.800> OPC<00:06:33.390> with<00:06:34.800> significantly<00:06:35.800> lower

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
Sofia be OPC with significantly lower

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:40.590 
Sofia be OPC with significantly lower
volumes<00:06:37.000> and<00:06:38.760> looking<00:06:39.760> into<00:06:39.910> the<00:06:40.030> market<00:06:40.480> and

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:40.600 
volumes and looking into the market and

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.020 
volumes and looking into the market and
looking<00:06:40.960> into<00:06:41.110> our<00:06:41.230> portfolio<00:06:42.010> we<00:06:42.190> do<00:06:42.460> not<00:06:42.700> see

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.030 
looking into our portfolio we do not see

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.220 
looking into our portfolio we do not see
that<00:06:43.600> is<00:06:44.470> a<00:06:44.530> big<00:06:45.400> enough<00:06:45.670> potential<00:06:46.210> or<00:06:46.570> two<00:06:46.780> to

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:47.230 
that is a big enough potential or two to

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.000 
that is a big enough potential or two to
have<00:06:48.010> another<00:06:48.400> one<00:06:48.670> of<00:06:48.820> those<00:06:49.650> so<00:06:50.650> we<00:06:50.830> will

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.010 
have another one of those so we will

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:59.499 
have another one of those so we will
focus<00:06:51.220> on<00:06:51.610> on<00:06:51.820> causa<00:06:52.120> as<00:06:52.420> time<00:06:52.690> in<00:06:52.900> Sofia

00:06:59.499 --> 00:06:59.509 

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:02.739 

alright<00:07:00.199> there's<00:07:00.439> a<00:07:00.529> there's<00:07:00.949> a<00:07:01.150> team<00:07:02.150> working

00:07:02.739 --> 00:07:02.749 
alright there's a there's a team working

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:04.839 
alright there's a there's a team working
on<00:07:03.020> the<00:07:03.229> on<00:07:03.409> the<00:07:03.559> future<00:07:03.919> strategy<00:07:04.400> but<00:07:04.610> I

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:04.849 
on the on the future strategy but I

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:08.079 
on the on the future strategy but I
believe<00:07:05.150> that's<00:07:05.360> too<00:07:05.569> early<00:07:05.809> now<00:07:05.960> to<00:07:07.089> comment

00:07:08.079 --> 00:07:08.089 
believe that's too early now to comment

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:11.619 
believe that's too early now to comment
and<00:07:08.680> decisions<00:07:09.680> haven't<00:07:10.069> been<00:07:10.159> made<00:07:10.309> yet<00:07:10.629> so

00:07:11.619 --> 00:07:11.629 
and decisions haven't been made yet so

00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:14.379 
and decisions haven't been made yet so
it's<00:07:12.589> a<00:07:12.680> little<00:07:12.830> bit<00:07:13.009> too<00:07:13.159> early<00:07:13.219> to<00:07:14.120> answer

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:14.389 
it's a little bit too early to answer

00:07:14.389 --> 00:08:14.119 
it's a little bit too early to answer
your<00:07:14.479> question

00:08:14.119 --> 00:08:14.129 

00:08:14.129 --> 00:08:16.189
