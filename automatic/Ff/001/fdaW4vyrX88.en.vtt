00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.460 
a kind of little journey that I made up
between<00:04:38.590> Liggett<00:04:39.550> ease<00:04:39.700> atmosphere<00:04:40.510> and<00:04:40.810> the

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
between Liggett ease atmosphere and the

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:45.659 
between Liggett ease atmosphere and the
prelude<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:42.150> Wagner's<00:04:43.150> Lohengrin<00:04:44.669> atmosphere

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 
prelude to Wagner's Lohengrin atmosphere

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.110 
prelude to Wagner's Lohengrin atmosphere
became<00:04:46.030> famous<00:04:46.450> through<00:04:47.050> Kubrick's<00:04:47.620> film

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
became famous through Kubrick's film

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.990 
became famous through Kubrick's film
2001<00:04:49.290> but<00:04:50.290> was<00:04:50.370> Ligety<00:04:51.370> seemed<00:04:51.669> to<00:04:51.790> be<00:04:51.880> the

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
2001 but was Ligety seemed to be the

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.990 
2001 but was Ligety seemed to be the
best<00:04:52.210> music<00:04:52.720> to<00:04:53.020> express<00:04:53.800> the<00:04:54.190> vastness<00:04:54.850> of

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
best music to express the vastness of

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.310 
best music to express the vastness of
space<00:04:55.540> and<00:04:56.080> the<00:04:56.200> unknowability<00:04:56.919> of<00:04:57.280> space<00:04:57.610> and

00:04:58.310 --> 00:04:58.320 
space and the unknowability of space and

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:03.290 
space and the unknowability of space and
it's<00:04:59.320> still<00:04:59.620> one<00:04:59.980> of<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.250> most<00:05:00.960> original<00:05:01.960> and

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
it's still one of the most original and

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:06.570 
it's still one of the most original and
as<00:05:04.300> its<00:05:04.510> title<00:05:04.870> suggests<00:05:05.190> atmospheric<00:05:06.190> pieces

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
as its title suggests atmospheric pieces

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.700 
as its title suggests atmospheric pieces
you<00:05:06.730> can<00:05:06.940> have<00:05:08.040> without<00:05:09.040> melody<00:05:09.850> a<00:05:10.090> bit<00:05:11.020> almost

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
you can have without melody a bit almost

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:14.400 
you can have without melody a bit almost
without<00:05:11.980> harmony<00:05:12.760> but<00:05:13.360> with<00:05:13.630> a<00:05:13.660> feeling<00:05:14.230> that

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
without harmony but with a feeling that

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.870 
without harmony but with a feeling that
it's<00:05:14.590> flying<00:05:15.430> in<00:05:15.820> from<00:05:16.270> an<00:05:16.450> immense<00:05:16.960> distance

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
it's flying in from an immense distance

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.370 
it's flying in from an immense distance
but<00:05:18.880> of<00:05:18.940> course<00:05:19.090> the<00:05:19.240> Grail<00:05:19.540> which<00:05:19.930> is<00:05:20.080> at<00:05:20.229> the

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:20.380 
but of course the Grail which is at the

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:22.500 
but of course the Grail which is at the
centre<00:05:20.800> of<00:05:20.950> Lohengrin<00:05:21.550> should<00:05:22.180> have<00:05:22.300> come

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
centre of Lohengrin should have come

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.170 
centre of Lohengrin should have come
from<00:05:22.720> an<00:05:22.810> even<00:05:23.229> further<00:05:23.530> even<00:05:24.180> further

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
from an even further even further

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.320 
from an even further even further
distance<00:05:25.780> so<00:05:26.290> we<00:05:26.590> feel<00:05:26.830> we<00:05:27.070> are<00:05:27.100> adding<00:05:27.610> the

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
distance so we feel we are adding the

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.630 
distance so we feel we are adding the
cosmic<00:05:29.040> to<00:05:30.040> the<00:05:30.250> spiritual<00:05:30.970> and<00:05:32.430> we've<00:05:33.430> all

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:33.640 
cosmic to the spiritual and we've all

cosmic to the spiritual and we've all
we've<00:05:33.910> had<00:05:34.030> the<00:05:34.150> experience<00:05:34.270> when<00:05:34.840> we've<00:05:34.990> put

we've had the experience when we've put

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:36.990 
we've had the experience when we've put
these<00:05:35.380> pieces<00:05:35.650> together<00:05:36.010> we<00:05:36.460> play<00:05:36.669> without<00:05:36.820> a

these pieces together we play without a

these pieces together we play without a
break<00:05:37.979> but<00:05:38.979> this<00:05:39.310> first<00:05:39.669> a<00:05:39.910> major<00:05:40.330> chord<00:05:41.910> of

the vogner is almost a shock after the

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:49.710 
the vogner is almost a shock after the

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.070 
sounds after these distance etiolated
sounds<00:05:50.410> of<00:05:50.620> Ligety<00:05:51.430> and<00:05:51.790> that<00:05:52.570> it<00:05:52.690> gives<00:05:52.900> a

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
sounds of Ligety and that it gives a

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.860 
sounds of Ligety and that it gives a
completely<00:05:53.680> different<00:05:53.979> journey<00:05:54.910> to<00:05:55.539> the<00:05:55.660> VAR
