the season and our first really bad
display<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:23.670> think<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.990> PSG<00:00:25.529> game<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:25.859> a

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
display I think the PSG game was a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.230 
display I think the PSG game was a
really<00:00:26.130> tough<00:00:26.310> one<00:00:26.490> we<00:00:26.609> can<00:00:26.730> see<00:00:26.910> the<00:00:27.029> poor

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
really tough one we can see the poor

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.089 
really tough one we can see the poor
goals<00:00:27.510> but<00:00:27.869> you<00:00:28.380> always<00:00:28.619> thought<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:29.010> know

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
goals but you always thought you know

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.380 
goals but you always thought you know
maybe<00:00:29.279> that<00:00:29.429> was<00:00:29.640> just<00:00:29.670> because<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.029> was<00:00:30.119> a<00:00:30.210> big

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
maybe that was just because it was a big

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.790 
maybe that was just because it was a big
test<00:00:30.630> and<00:00:30.840> we<00:00:30.960> didn't<00:00:31.109> really<00:00:31.199> rise<00:00:31.470> to<00:00:31.679> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
all give credit to Real Madrid I think

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.490 
all give credit to Real Madrid I think
to<00:01:00.300> be<00:01:00.420> fair<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.750> them<00:01:00.870> today<00:01:00.989> they<00:01:01.140> played

to be fair to them today they played
very<00:01:01.530> well<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:01.949> thought<00:01:02.219> misko<00:01:02.550> came<00:01:02.820> in<00:01:02.969> for

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
very well I thought misko came in for

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.149 
very well I thought misko came in for
Gareth<00:01:03.420> Bale<00:01:03.629> was<00:01:04.229> outstanding<00:01:04.619> going

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
Gareth Bale was outstanding going

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.710 
Gareth Bale was outstanding going
forward<00:01:05.519> and<00:01:05.640> defensively<00:01:06.180> worked<00:01:06.479> really

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
forward and defensively worked really

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.969 
forward and defensively worked really
hard<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.170> said<00:01:07.380> when<00:01:07.530> he<00:01:07.590> came<00:01:07.799> off<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
hard and I said when he came off the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.070 
hard and I said when he came off the
pitch<00:01:08.220> he<00:01:08.640> was<00:01:08.760> absolutely<00:01:09.510> shattered<00:01:09.750> that's

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
pitch he was absolutely shattered that's

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.810 
pitch he was absolutely shattered that's
why<00:01:10.229> yet<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.560> come<00:01:10.740> off<00:01:10.890> because<00:01:11.280> he<00:01:11.520> really

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
why yet to come off because he really

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.429 
why yet to come off because he really
worked<00:01:12.030> his<00:01:12.210> socks<00:01:12.479> off<00:01:12.659> you'd<00:01:12.840> run<00:01:13.049> himself

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
worked his socks off you'd run himself

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.929 
worked his socks off you'd run himself
into<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.740> ground<00:01:13.920> that's<00:01:14.400> what<00:01:14.640> we<00:01:14.760> should

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
into the ground that's what we should

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.520 
into the ground that's what we should
have<00:01:15.030> had<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.360> should<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.630> had<00:01:15.720> players<00:01:16.140> who

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
have had we should have had players who

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.050 
have had we should have had players who
were<00:01:16.619> out<00:01:16.830> on<00:01:17.009> their<00:01:17.159> feet<00:01:17.400> and<00:01:17.490> we<00:01:17.580> didn't<00:01:17.850> I

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
were out on their feet and we didn't I

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.999 
were out on their feet and we didn't I
think<00:01:18.540> Real<00:01:18.689> Madrid<00:01:19.020> pressed<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.530> high<00:01:19.710> they

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
think Real Madrid pressed as high they

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.649 
think Real Madrid pressed as high they
worked<00:01:20.250> very<00:01:20.340> hard<00:01:20.549> their<00:01:20.939> intensity<00:01:21.450> was

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
worked very hard their intensity was

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.330 
worked very hard their intensity was
good<00:01:21.810> every<00:01:22.380> time<00:01:22.409> there<00:01:22.740> was<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:22.860> loose<00:01:23.070> ball

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
good every time there was a loose ball

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.520 
good every time there was a loose ball
they<00:01:23.759> were<00:01:23.820> first<00:01:24.119> to<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.990> crowd<00:01:25.350> or

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
they were first to it the crowd or

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.050 
they were first to it the crowd or
behind<00:01:25.860> them<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.610> moan<00:01:26.729> about<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
but let's face it we didn't lose the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.580 
but let's face it we didn't lose the
game<00:01:30.329> on<00:01:30.509> refereeing<00:01:30.960> decisions<00:01:31.020> today<00:01:31.439> we

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
game on refereeing decisions today we

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.249 
game on refereeing decisions today we
lost<00:01:31.799> 3-1<00:01:32.130> three<00:01:32.970> good<00:01:33.180> goals<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.750> if<00:01:34.049> Real

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
lost 3-1 three good goals and if Real

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.390 
lost 3-1 three good goals and if Real
Madrid<00:01:34.560> had<00:01:34.650> actually<00:01:34.920> played<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> ball

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
Madrid had actually played the ball

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.370 
Madrid had actually played the ball
better<00:01:35.670> in<00:01:35.909> counter-attacking<00:01:36.509> areas<00:01:36.990> we

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
better in counter-attacking areas we

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.630 
better in counter-attacking areas we
could<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:37.650> lost<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:38.009> by<00:01:38.130> even<00:01:38.400> more<00:01:38.430> I<00:01:38.579> think

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
could have lost it by even more I think

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.490 
could have lost it by even more I think
3-1<00:01:39.299> is<00:01:39.390> probably<00:01:39.600> quite<00:01:39.720> lucky<00:01:40.079> for<00:01:40.229> us<00:01:40.320> today

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
3-1 is probably quite lucky for us today

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.800 
3-1 is probably quite lucky for us today
we<00:01:41.100> did<00:01:41.250> not<00:01:41.280> play<00:01:41.579> at<00:01:41.700> all<00:01:41.820> well<00:01:42.119> we<00:01:42.540> scored

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
we did not play at all well we scored

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.630 
we did not play at all well we scored
actually<00:01:43.140> very<00:01:43.290> early<00:01:43.740> I<00:01:43.890> think<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.369> early

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
actually very early I think the early

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.310 
actually very early I think the early
goal<00:01:44.820> from<00:01:44.939> Neymar<00:01:45.329> probably<00:01:45.810> did<00:01:45.960> set<00:01:46.170> us

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
goal from Neymar probably did set us

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.080 
goal from Neymar probably did set us
back<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> bit<00:01:46.860> we<00:01:47.189> sort<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.520> didn't<00:01:47.850> clearly

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
back a bit we sort of didn't clearly

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.700 
back a bit we sort of didn't clearly
play<00:01:48.270> as<00:01:48.420> well<00:01:48.570> he<00:01:48.720> wasn't<00:01:48.840> really<00:01:48.990> keeping

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
play as well he wasn't really keeping

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.590 
play as well he wasn't really keeping
the<00:01:49.829> intensity<00:01:50.430> after<00:01:50.549> we'd<00:01:50.820> scored<00:01:51.180> we<00:01:51.299> sat

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
the intensity after we'd scored we sat

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.819 
the intensity after we'd scored we sat
back<00:01:51.810> a<00:01:51.840> little<00:01:51.990> further<00:01:52.290> than<00:01:52.530> maybe<00:01:52.680> we

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
back a little further than maybe we

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.310 
back a little further than maybe we
wanted<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.909> was<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.119> mistake<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:55.079> think

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
wanted to that was a mistake and I think

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.539 
wanted to that was a mistake and I think

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.219 
first of all you have to look at Luis
Enrique<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.119> look<00:01:57.270> at<00:01:57.360> his<00:01:57.450> team<00:01:57.659> selection

we've<00:03:24.840> been<00:03:25.019> playing<00:03:25.260> very<00:03:25.320> well<00:03:25.560> against

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
we've been playing very well against

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.069 
we've been playing very well against
athletic<00:03:26.280> for<00:03:26.400> most<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.790> game<00:03:27.079> against

Malaga we saw it against PSG we've
actually<00:03:30.570> probably<00:03:30.900> over<00:03:31.320> performed<00:03:31.799> so<00:03:32.220> we

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
actually probably over performed so we

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.979 
actually probably over performed so we
need<00:03:32.489> to<00:03:32.549> just<00:03:32.700> sit<00:03:32.910> back<00:03:32.940> you<00:03:33.420> know<00:03:33.540> take<00:03:33.840> it

how bad the game is going is they're

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:45.560 
how bad the game is going is they're
losing<00:03:42.690> belief<00:03:43.500> and<00:03:43.859> also<00:03:44.519> losing<00:03:44.880> the<00:03:45.180> desire

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
losing belief and also losing the desire

strong tackles you covered well down the

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.809 
strong tackles you covered well down the
right-hand<00:04:39.719> side<00:04:39.960> and<00:04:40.229> Mathieu<00:04:41.159> bring<00:04:41.699> him

00:04:41.809 --> 00:04:41.819

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
left back and then you take that problem

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.279 
left back and then you take that problem
at<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.759> equation<00:04:45.240> because<00:04:45.719> pique<00:04:46.080> was<00:04:46.259> a

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
at the equation because pique was a

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.589 
at the equation because pique was a
massive<00:04:46.710> problem<00:04:46.740> today<00:04:47.159> the<00:04:48.120> other<00:04:48.270> problem

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599 
massive problem today the other problem

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.080 
massive problem today the other problem
is<00:04:48.659> our<00:04:48.810> midfield<00:04:48.990> we<00:04:49.860> got<00:04:50.009> absolutely<00:04:50.219> over

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:51.090 
is our midfield we got absolutely over

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.540 
is our midfield we got absolutely over
ran<00:04:51.300> and<00:04:51.599> I<00:04:51.689> do<00:04:51.749> wonder<00:04:52.439> about<00:04:52.590> the<00:04:53.159> midfield

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
ran and I do wonder about the midfield

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.070 
ran and I do wonder about the midfield
we<00:04:53.729> have<00:04:53.879> we<00:04:54.029> have<00:04:54.120> Sergio<00:04:54.479> Busquets<00:04:54.779> oh<00:04:55.020> I

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
we have we have Sergio Busquets oh I

00:04:56.239 --> 00:04:56.249

thought they very very well on the first
half<00:04:56.729> he<00:04:57.210> won<00:04:57.389> the<00:04:57.539> ball<00:04:57.719> very<00:04:57.990> very<00:04:58.199> high<00:04:58.349> up

00:04:58.459 --> 00:04:58.469

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
the pitch he was passing was good but

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:01.700 
the pitch he was passing was good but
the<00:05:00.330> second<00:05:00.750> half<00:05:00.870> it<00:05:01.080> wasn't<00:05:01.439> quite<00:05:01.529> as

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
the second half it wasn't quite as

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.159 
the second half it wasn't quite as
intense<00:05:02.039> from<00:05:02.340> him<00:05:02.550> Iniesta<00:05:03.180> had<00:05:03.569> a<00:05:03.599> poor<00:05:03.870> game

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169 
intense from him Iniesta had a poor game

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:06.290 
intense from him Iniesta had a poor game

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:06.300 
wasn't involved a lot shabby tried to

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.450 
wasn't involved a lot shabby tried to
control<00:05:06.659> things<00:05:06.960> but<00:05:07.500> again<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:08.219> don't

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:08.460 
control things but again you don't

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.429

how<00:05:16.620> we<00:05:16.680> go<00:05:16.949> address<00:05:17.310> this<00:05:17.520> because<00:05:17.729> I<00:05:18.000> I<00:05:18.240> do

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
how we go address this because I I do

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.969 
how we go address this because I I do

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:22.730 
wonder whether we do have to start
playing<00:05:20.279> maybe<00:05:20.520> with<00:05:20.819> Mascherano<00:05:21.360> and<00:05:21.740> sergio

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 
in defensive midfield because we don't

two players you can get up and turn the

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.779 
two players you can get up and turn the
pitch<00:05:33.419> you<00:05:33.810> can<00:05:33.990> defend<00:05:34.379> who<00:05:34.770> can<00:05:34.919> attack<00:05:35.279> who

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
Iniesta they're not as an athletic so if

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.809 
Iniesta they're not as an athletic so if
you<00:05:40.110> are<00:05:40.259> gonna<00:05:40.409> play<00:05:40.589> players<00:05:40.979> like<00:05:41.219> that<00:05:41.250> you

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:41.819 
you are gonna play players like that you

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:43.339 
you are gonna play players like that you
do<00:05:42.089> need<00:05:42.300> the<00:05:42.449> protection<00:05:42.899> behind<00:05:43.050> them

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:43.349 
do need the protection behind them

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.320 
do need the protection behind them
because<00:05:43.439> the<00:05:43.680> back<00:05:43.860> for<00:05:44.069> today<00:05:44.250> were<00:05:44.819> exposed

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
wrong and it's going to be very

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.440 
wrong and it's going to be very
interesting<00:07:14.640> we<00:07:14.760> bounce<00:07:14.940> back<00:07:15.090> from<00:07:15.330> this
