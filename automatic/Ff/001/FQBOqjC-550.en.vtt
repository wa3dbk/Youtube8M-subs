00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.960
 five year old star 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.689
 who wanted to fall in sales 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.310
 the club reports that 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.500
 koekange 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.670
 who counts the newspaper that claimed that 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.670
 to become 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.300

 bunny munro euro with one 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.930
 for the club that reports the goal 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.590
 the man heard i am never doing yes but i am not there anymore 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.510
 the fire department reported that 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.250
 there is now shopping without money I am me 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.090
 also no more years 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.150
 you can't last too long 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.120
 follow what namely no money and the shares stand that court 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.010
 that means that you are good for someone else 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.110
 with fashion conditions 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.870
 the age of the yacht and what the property is smiling at 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.170
 all that nuisance with violence especially the good ones that you did not have 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.990
 the value of the material 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.170
 that money is made in the intention core values ​​this where should not be higher 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.950
 are then the value that the extension saves on the bridge street 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.100
 until the end of the seventeenth century, the making of technology was due to 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.140
 their commitment was therefore the quality of the conscious person 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.319
 as a result, the language of goods and services became only with one 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.839
 poor quality 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.639
 the mob of good quality have withheld poets for five seasons 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:18.549
 signs about sadness as more money circulates that are the same 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.799
 nominal value therefore on payments generally take place in the money 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.489
 earn cyclic values ​​or as a result, we would be well served 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.920
 The intrinsic value of money is therefore almost non-existent 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.399
 because the paper on which the money is printed is worth nothing 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:37.429
 The face value of money is very important to us because it is as general 

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:39.269
 the share has been accepted 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.269
 this is why they attach so much value to it 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.849
