00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
apparently they run a red light and so I

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.289 
apparently they run a red light and so I
told<00:01:43.200> them<00:01:43.320> my<00:01:43.380> car<00:01:43.649> had<00:01:44.070> had<00:01:44.850> pretty<00:01:45.119> bad

whiplash for five five six

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.230 
whiplash for five five six

so it's kind of affected by it and you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.029 
so it's kind of affected by it and you
know<00:01:50.359> very<00:01:50.719> low<00:01:50.990> training<00:01:51.319> if<00:01:51.560> any<00:01:51.740> training

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.169 
it was just really frustrating to feel
like<00:01:54.649> you're<00:01:54.859> you're<00:01:55.399> on<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.549> wave<00:01:55.819> you're

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
like you're you're on a wave you're

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.209 
like you're you're on a wave you're
you're<00:01:56.509> gonna<00:01:56.600> catch<00:01:56.869> catch<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:57.770> break<00:01:57.979> of<00:01:58.130> it

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
you're gonna catch catch the break of it

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.800 
you're gonna catch catch the break of it
and<00:01:58.429> then<00:01:58.579> to<00:01:59.299> have<00:01:59.390> something<00:01:59.630> like<00:01:59.780> that

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
and then to have something like that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.270 
and then to have something like that
happen<00:02:00.079> you<00:02:00.409> know<00:02:00.500> you're<00:02:00.649> stuck<00:02:00.859> sitting<00:02:01.189> on

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
happen you know you're stuck sitting on

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.340 
happen you know you're stuck sitting on
the<00:02:01.369> sidelines<00:02:01.819> and<00:02:02.060> definitely<00:02:02.689> in<00:02:02.750> one<00:02:02.780> you

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
the sidelines and definitely in one you

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.050 
the sidelines and definitely in one you
know<00:02:03.439> you<00:02:03.799> see<00:02:04.219> other<00:02:04.429> people<00:02:04.759> getting<00:02:04.909> these

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
know you see other people getting these

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.240 
know you see other people getting these
opportunities<00:02:05.740> was<00:02:06.740> it<00:02:06.859> hard<00:02:07.039> for<00:02:07.130> you<00:02:07.219> to

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
opportunities was it hard for you to

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.860 
opportunities was it hard for you to
stay<00:02:07.459> positive<00:02:07.700> you<00:02:10.480> know<00:02:11.480> I<00:02:11.569> think<00:02:11.690> I<00:02:11.840> just

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
stay positive you know I think I just

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.930 
stay positive you know I think I just
got<00:02:12.140> frustrated<00:02:12.440> more<00:02:12.860> than<00:02:13.069> anything<00:02:13.280> you

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
got frustrated more than anything you

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.430 
got frustrated more than anything you
know<00:02:14.060> fighting<00:02:14.690> is<00:02:14.840> all<00:02:14.989> about<00:02:15.260> being

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
know fighting is all about being

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.800 
know fighting is all about being
relevant<00:02:15.620> and<00:02:16.069> not<00:02:16.849> fighting<00:02:17.180> you're<00:02:17.629> not

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
relevant and not fighting you're not

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.960 
relevant and not fighting you're not
relevant<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:19.099> so<00:02:19.310> I<00:02:19.340> think<00:02:19.459> that<00:02:19.610> those<00:02:19.819> are

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
relevant and so I think that those are

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.089 
relevant and so I think that those are
hard<00:02:20.180> things<00:02:20.209> as<00:02:20.690> someone<00:02:21.019> who<00:02:21.170> wants<00:02:21.349> to<00:02:21.590> I

00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:22.099 
hard things as someone who wants to I

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.819 
hard things as someone who wants to I
want<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.640> be<00:02:22.700> the<00:02:22.849> best<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:23.870> know<00:02:23.930> that<00:02:24.530> I

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
want to be the best and I know that I

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:29.470 
want to be the best and I know that I
can<00:02:25.340> be<00:02:25.489> the<00:02:25.579> best<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.629> to<00:02:27.200> not<00:02:27.500> be<00:02:27.680> able<00:02:27.769> to<00:02:28.480> be

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
can be the best so to not be able to be

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.990 
can be the best so to not be able to be
able<00:02:29.569> to<00:02:29.690> explore<00:02:30.230> that<00:02:30.290> and<00:02:31.160> push<00:02:31.760> farther

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
able to explore that and push farther

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:43.820 
able to explore that and push farther
and<00:02:32.360> be<00:02:32.900> improving<00:02:33.349> everyday<00:02:34.030> is<00:02:35.030> hard

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830
