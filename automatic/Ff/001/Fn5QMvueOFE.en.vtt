today<00:00:18.890> we'll<00:00:19.220> be<00:00:19.460> reviewing<00:00:19.520> the<00:00:19.970> HP<00:00:20.630> stream<00:00:20.840> 8

today we'll be reviewing the HP stream 8

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.350 
today we'll be reviewing the HP stream 8
which<00:00:21.830> may<00:00:22.310> seem<00:00:22.610> a<00:00:22.640> lot<00:00:22.940> like<00:00:23.210> his

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
which may seem a lot like his

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
predecessor the HP stream 7 but one inch

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.740 
predecessor the HP stream 7 but one inch
can<00:00:27.080> make<00:00:27.260> a<00:00:27.290> big<00:00:27.740> difference

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
can make a big difference

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:34.110 
can make a big difference
hardware<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:30.430> HP<00:00:31.430> stream<00:00:31.640> 8<00:00:31.940> has<00:00:32.660> a<00:00:33.039> 1.6

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
hardware the HP stream 8 has a 1.6

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.810 
hardware the HP stream 8 has a 1.6
gigahertz<00:00:35.120> Atom<00:00:36.079> processor<00:00:36.429> which<00:00:37.429> isn't

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
gigahertz Atom processor which isn't

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.119 
gigahertz Atom processor which isn't
that<00:00:37.999> fast<00:00:38.359> but<00:00:38.809> it<00:00:38.929> isn't<00:00:39.350> that<00:00:39.530> slow<00:00:39.920> either

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
that fast but it isn't that slow either

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.669 
that fast but it isn't that slow either
just<00:00:40.609> mid-range<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:41.659> it<00:00:42.289> only<00:00:42.409> has<00:00:42.649> one

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:42.679 
just mid-range and it only has one

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:45.520 
just mid-range and it only has one
gigabyte<00:00:43.640> of<00:00:43.820> RAM<00:00:44.089> so<00:00:44.390> it's<00:00:44.570> not<00:00:44.870> that<00:00:45.170> ideal

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
gigabyte of RAM so it's not that ideal

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.739 
gigabyte of RAM so it's not that ideal
for<00:00:45.769> gamers<00:00:46.069> so<00:00:46.789> if<00:00:47.089> you're<00:00:47.269> a<00:00:47.300> gamer<00:00:47.569> I

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:47.749 
for gamers so if you're a gamer I

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:50.229 
for gamers so if you're a gamer I
suggest<00:00:48.440> look<00:00:48.800> for<00:00:49.010> another<00:00:49.190> mini<00:00:49.519> tablet<00:00:50.059> and

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
suggest look for another mini tablet and

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.259 
suggest look for another mini tablet and
it<00:00:51.170> has<00:00:51.379> a<00:00:51.710> 1<00:00:52.249> micro<00:00:52.729> USB<00:00:53.239> 2.0<00:00:54.079> charging<00:00:55.269> one

00:00:56.259 --> 00:00:56.269 
it has a 1 micro USB 2.0 charging one

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:59.469 
it has a 1 micro USB 2.0 charging one
headphone<00:00:56.659> jack<00:00:57.229> one<00:00:58.219> integrated<00:00:58.969> microphone

00:00:59.469 --> 00:00:59.479 
headphone jack one integrated microphone

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.340 
headphone jack one integrated microphone
with<00:00:59.899> stereo<00:01:00.409> speakers<00:01:01.010> and<00:01:01.399> one<00:01:02.389> micro<00:01:02.899> SD

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:03.350 
with stereo speakers and one micro SD

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.480 
with stereo speakers and one micro SD
card<00:01:03.710> with<00:01:04.280> space<00:01:04.610> up<00:01:04.909> to<00:01:05.590> 128<00:01:06.590> gigabytes<00:01:06.619> and

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
card with space up to 128 gigabytes and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.440 
card with space up to 128 gigabytes and
this<00:01:08.240> micro<00:01:08.659> SD<00:01:08.899> card<00:01:09.170> is<00:01:09.380> amazing<00:01:10.130> because

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
this micro SD card is amazing because

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.649 
this micro SD card is amazing because
sometimes<00:01:11.450> I<00:01:11.689> go<00:01:12.049> over<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:13.180> maximum<00:01:14.180> 32

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
sometimes I go over the maximum 32

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.200 
sometimes I go over the maximum 32
gigabytes<00:01:15.170> without<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.920> micro<00:01:16.340> SD<00:01:16.610> card<00:01:16.880> and

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
gigabytes without the micro SD card and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.499 
gigabytes without the micro SD card and
it<00:01:18.020> really<00:01:18.619> is<00:01:18.799> a<00:01:18.829> pain<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:19.670> like<00:01:19.850> delete<00:01:20.180> stuff

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
it really is a pain to like delete stuff

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:24.520 
it really is a pain to like delete stuff
so<00:01:20.899> it's<00:01:21.350> great<00:01:21.979> but<00:01:22.640> and<00:01:22.850> it<00:01:23.719> only<00:01:23.869> comes<00:01:24.229> in

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
so it's great but and it only comes in

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.830 
so it's great but and it only comes in
one<00:01:24.740> color<00:01:25.369> and<00:01:25.490> that<00:01:25.700> is<00:01:25.759> licorice<00:01:26.299> black

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
one color and that is licorice black

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.099 
one color and that is licorice black
battery<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:28.340> battery<00:01:28.579> life<00:01:29.060> is<00:01:29.090> reported<00:01:30.079> to

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:30.109 
battery the battery life is reported to

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:33.279 
battery the battery life is reported to
be<00:01:30.320> eight<00:01:30.530> hours<00:01:30.740> which<00:01:31.520> is<00:01:31.759> pretty<00:01:32.210> good<00:01:32.600> but

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
be eight hours which is pretty good but

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:35.740 
be eight hours which is pretty good but
I<00:01:33.320> found<00:01:33.680> out<00:01:33.920> that<00:01:34.159> it's<00:01:34.340> only<00:01:34.579> four<00:01:35.149> hours

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
I found out that it's only four hours

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.160 
I found out that it's only four hours
and<00:01:36.079> it<00:01:36.500> really<00:01:37.009> sucks<00:01:37.700> when<00:01:38.060> my<00:01:38.509> battery<00:01:38.930> just

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
and it really sucks when my battery just

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.520 
and it really sucks when my battery just
goes<00:01:39.619> yep<00:01:40.100> because<00:01:40.729> I<00:01:41.420> didn't<00:01:41.960> charge<00:01:42.229> it

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
goes yep because I didn't charge it

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.370 
goes yep because I didn't charge it
tonight<00:01:42.740> before<00:01:43.100> and<00:01:43.609> has<00:01:44.000> almost<00:01:44.450> no<00:01:44.869> battery

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
tonight before and has almost no battery

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.310 
tonight before and has almost no battery
at<00:01:45.469> all<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:45.920> I<00:01:46.490> couldn't<00:01:47.030> do<00:01:47.179> anything<00:01:47.320> so

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
at all and I couldn't do anything so

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.240 
at all and I couldn't do anything so
it's<00:01:48.770> not<00:01:49.429> ideal<00:01:49.789> for<00:01:50.359> battery<00:01:50.840> so<00:01:51.200> it's<00:01:52.070> not

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
it's not ideal for battery so it's not

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.609 
it's not ideal for battery so it's not
good<00:01:52.579> for<00:01:52.609> gamers<00:01:53.329> and<00:01:53.689> it's<00:01:54.020> not<00:01:54.259> good<00:01:54.590> for

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
good for gamers and it's not good for

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.149 
good for gamers and it's not good for
power<00:01:55.009> user<00:01:55.399> just<00:01:55.759> keep<00:01:56.060> that<00:01:56.210> in<00:01:56.270> mind

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:57.159 
power user just keep that in mind

00:01:57.159 --> 00:02:00.609 
power user just keep that in mind

HP stream 8 is 8 inches the big
difference<00:02:31.640> is<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.909> size<00:02:32.420> obviously<00:02:33.879> the

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:34.879 
difference is the size obviously the

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.339 
difference is the size obviously the
size<00:02:35.599> is<00:02:36.019> really<00:02:36.709> really<00:02:37.400> nice<00:02:37.760> on<00:02:38.060> the<00:02:38.349> HP

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
size is really really nice on the HP

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.349 
size is really really nice on the HP
stream<00:02:39.530> 8<00:02:39.829> because<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.489> allows<00:02:40.939> more

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.359 
stream 8 because it allows more

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:44.170 
stream 8 because it allows more
productivity<00:02:42.129> sometimes<00:02:43.129> I<00:02:43.310> feel<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.760> HP

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
productivity sometimes I feel the HP

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.050 
productivity sometimes I feel the HP
stream<00:02:44.359> 7<00:02:44.480> is<00:02:45.140> a<00:02:45.409> little<00:02:45.769> bit<00:02:45.950> compact<00:02:46.730> with

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
stream 7 is a little bit compact with

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.509 
stream 7 is a little bit compact with
the<00:02:47.120> HP<00:02:47.510> stream<00:02:47.690> 8<00:02:47.959> opens<00:02:48.829> up<00:02:49.040> a<00:02:49.159> little<00:02:49.280> bit

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
the HP stream 8 opens up a little bit

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.059 
the HP stream 8 opens up a little bit
more<00:02:49.700> and<00:02:50.000> that's<00:02:50.900> also<00:02:51.290> because<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.889> the

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:52.069 
more and that's also because of the

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:54.490 
more and that's also because of the
screen<00:02:52.340> resolution<00:02:52.690> which<00:02:53.690> is<00:02:53.870> 80<00:02:54.170> pixels

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
screen resolution which is 80 pixels

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.360 
screen resolution which is 80 pixels
better<00:02:55.010> because<00:02:55.670> on<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:55.970> HP<00:02:56.150> stream<00:02:56.480> 7<00:02:56.569> it's

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
better because on the HP stream 7 it's

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.509 
better because on the HP stream 7 it's
1200<00:02:58.370> by<00:02:58.489> 800<00:02:59.269> on<00:02:59.420> the<00:02:59.840> HP<00:02:59.989> stream<00:03:00.290> 8<00:03:00.530> is<00:03:00.889> 1280

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
1200 by 800 on the HP stream 8 is 1280

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:02.559 
1200 by 800 on the HP stream 8 is 1280
by<00:03:01.819> 800

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
by 800

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:05.379 
by 800
so<00:03:03.019> one<00:03:03.680> inch<00:03:03.920> really<00:03:04.670> makes<00:03:04.909> a<00:03:05.030> big

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:05.389 
so one inch really makes a big

00:03:05.389 --> 00:03:08.800 
so one inch really makes a big
difference<00:03:06.579> before<00:03:07.579> we<00:03:07.939> go<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.359> pros<00:03:08.629> and

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:08.810 
difference before we go to the pros and

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.949 
difference before we go to the pros and
cons<00:03:09.049> here<00:03:09.889> you<00:03:10.069> can<00:03:10.250> see<00:03:10.400> the<00:03:10.609> HP<00:03:10.760> stream<00:03:11.239> 7<00:03:11.329> on

00:03:11.949 --> 00:03:11.959 
cons here you can see the HP stream 7 on

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.679

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
right as you can see there's a really

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.909 
right as you can see there's a really
big<00:03:17.239> difference<00:03:17.299> even<00:03:18.169> though<00:03:18.260> it's<00:03:18.410> one<00:03:18.680> inch

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:18.919 
big difference even though it's one inch

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:21.789 
big difference even though it's one inch
you<00:03:19.190> can<00:03:19.459> tell<00:03:20.060> like<00:03:20.269> it's<00:03:20.540> really<00:03:21.109> amazing

you can tell like it's really amazing
how<00:03:22.190> big<00:03:22.400> the<00:03:22.609> difference<00:03:22.730> is<00:03:23.209> by<00:03:24.109> the<00:03:24.169> way

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
how big the difference is by the way

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
preview isn't as touch friendly so just

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.770

watch<00:03:42.859> out<00:03:43.129> for<00:03:43.159> that<00:03:43.370> and<00:03:43.729> in<00:03:44.269> case<00:03:44.540> you're

and cons let's start with the pros well
this<00:04:09.620> has<00:04:09.859> a<00:04:09.889> really<00:04:10.579> nice<00:04:10.940> browsing<00:04:11.690> it's

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
this has a really nice browsing it's

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.899 
this has a really nice browsing it's
nice<00:04:12.199> to<00:04:12.409> hold<00:04:12.680> and<00:04:12.979> it's<00:04:13.159> nice<00:04:13.400> and<00:04:13.669> graceful

00:04:13.899 --> 00:04:13.909 
nice to hold and it's nice and graceful

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.710 
nice to hold and it's nice and graceful
and<00:04:14.449> it<00:04:15.409> has<00:04:15.709> a<00:04:15.739> micro<00:04:16.280> SD<00:04:16.609> which<00:04:16.909> comes<00:04:17.570> in

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
and it has a micro SD which comes in

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.469 
and it has a micro SD which comes in
handy<00:04:17.750> quite<00:04:18.289> a<00:04:18.349> bit<00:04:18.620> and<00:04:18.859> it<00:04:19.609> has<00:04:20.090> a<00:04:20.120> really

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:20.479 
handy quite a bit and it has a really

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:23.050 
handy quite a bit and it has a really
nice<00:04:20.690> size<00:04:21.019> between<00:04:21.409> 7<00:04:22.099> inches<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.460> 9<00:04:22.820> inches

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:23.060 
nice size between 7 inches and 9 inches

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:26.879 
nice size between 7 inches and 9 inches
so<00:04:23.690> it's<00:04:23.840> really<00:04:24.289> really<00:04:25.070> nice<00:04:25.219> to<00:04:25.490> hold<00:04:25.690> cons

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
so it's really really nice to hold cons

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.490 
so it's really really nice to hold cons
well<00:04:27.889> the

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
well the

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.260 
well the
is<00:04:28.800> a<00:04:28.860> bit<00:04:29.340> iffy<00:04:29.820> it's<00:04:30.480> at<00:04:31.190> $170<00:04:32.190> while<00:04:32.490> the<00:04:32.790> HP

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
is a bit iffy it's at $170 while the HP

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.850 
is a bit iffy it's at $170 while the HP
stream<00:04:33.420> 7<00:04:33.510> is<00:04:34.260> only<00:04:34.440> at<00:04:34.730> $100<00:04:35.730> so<00:04:36.540> it's<00:04:36.840> a<00:04:36.990> $70

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
stream 7 is only at $100 so it's a $70

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:40.760 
stream 7 is only at $100 so it's a $70
difference<00:04:38.430> just<00:04:38.730> for<00:04:38.970> a<00:04:39.000> 1<00:04:39.390> inch<00:04:39.630> but<00:04:39.930> depends

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
and your hands start hurting but

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:14.840 
and your hands start hurting but
otherwise<00:05:11.570> that's<00:05:12.570> it<00:05:12.810> I<00:05:13.340> think<00:05:14.340> that<00:05:14.430> this

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:14.850 
otherwise that's it I think that this

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.900 
otherwise that's it I think that this
tablet<00:05:15.180> is<00:05:15.540> a<00:05:15.600> buy<00:05:16.020> although<00:05:16.440> its<00:05:17.130> predecessor

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
tablet is a buy although its predecessor

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.470 
tablet is a buy although its predecessor
the<00:05:18.120> HP<00:05:18.540> stream<00:05:18.720> 7<00:05:18.810> at<00:05:19.550> $99<00:05:20.550> was<00:05:20.790> not<00:05:21.120> a<00:05:21.150> buy

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
the HP stream 7 at $99 was not a buy

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.590 
the HP stream 7 at $99 was not a buy
this<00:05:22.200> one<00:05:22.590> inch<00:05:22.860> difference<00:05:23.160> makes<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.180> easier

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
this one inch difference makes it easier

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.650 
this one inch difference makes it easier
to<00:05:24.750> hold<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.260> gives<00:05:25.710> Windows<00:05:26.220> a<00:05:26.250> better<00:05:26.850> look

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660
