00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:08.660
 It will be a national road show on March 23 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:10.420
 Sugar rush 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.100
 this 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.240
 To the movie release 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.240
 From Morinaga Seika 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.090
 There is a sugar rush version of Packuncho 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:29.180
 It seems to be released in limited 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:33.700
 I bought it so I would like to introduce that 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.700
 In the case of Seven Eleven 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:39.660
 This is a campaign without sugar 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.079
 When you buy the target product 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.340
 If you can apply for the campaign 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.960
 By saying 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.540
 I'm doing 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.540
 This is the target product 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.520
 I want to show you the same contents 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.280
 Open 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.280
 eh 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.280
 Hmm 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.340
 Hmm 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.050
 Hmm 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.450
 Also I'm doing Toka chocolate balls to say that really 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:40.720
 In the feeling that we coat white chocolate around normal packuncho 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.720
 It has become 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.100
 I lost a little 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.770
 In fact 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.710
 And was once the Pakkun length chocolate has entered taste 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.780
 When it is coated with white chocolate as it is 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.080
 It's not like I said 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.080
 is 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:19.330
 Price 168 or just yeah 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.330
 It is the amount that can be applied for the campaign, so please try it
