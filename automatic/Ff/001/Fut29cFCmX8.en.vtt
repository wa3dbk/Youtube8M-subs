energy<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:27.659> invest<00:01:28.650> it<00:01:28.860> in<00:01:29.009> something<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
energy and invest it in something that

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.580

technique<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.189> feel<00:01:38.900> gets<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.049> best

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
technique that I feel gets the best

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.630 
technique that I feel gets the best
results<00:01:40.409> and<00:01:40.920> will<00:01:41.070> give<00:01:41.220> you<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> highest

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
results and will give you the highest

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.020 
results and will give you the highest
leverage<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.689> here<00:01:42.840> it<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.020> you<00:01:43.920> must<00:01:44.189> learn<00:01:44.549> to
