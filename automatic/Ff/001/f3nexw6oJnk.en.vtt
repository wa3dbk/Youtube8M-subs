00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.709
 Here we are a lot of devastation 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:17.890
 In the 70-75, the cutter kills me here 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:21.759
 with my level 40 degrees why we 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:24.040
 want to get to the point here on the island 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:28.060
 the viewpoint is just like that 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:31.179
 a mountain is easy you start here 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.160
 with brand left post and then here 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:34.600
 over and then come so spring 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.629
 You have to pass the top of the mountain 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.220
 is and take it just that there only 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:41.879
 on the way one or the other pretty 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.879
 strong goes 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:52.590
 I'll have to go first 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.710
 see dealers 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.580
 then , student is good i am 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.580
 blinded 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.350
 pow 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.350
 st 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:27.150
 so spring passage now comes the jump 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.840
 the setting overflows so exactly that 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.840
 you will be here afterwards 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.200
 we have to go around here 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.750
 as it went now 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:06.290
 talks about it 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:10.940
 until then great 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.940
 they are jumping again 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:18.500
 are 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.500
 briefly describe marco 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:30.340
 in so it gets high here 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.579
 most where should i stop now 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.470
 actually speak easily her 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:03:00.859
 You just have to go over there 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:00.859
 look right stand 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.530
 I agree but we are here 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:14.510
 piece down right now completely 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:17.000
 slowly we have to jump over it and 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:19.300
 then continue up 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.300
 so 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:27.400
 malama and play 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.670
 so the back of the crafts is dead 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:43.850
 here is the starting point and you have to 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.490
 watch out if you come here and 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.640
 the crew is too there comes an opponent 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.470
 the magician and that is pretty strong 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.720
 So only the best craft then the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.070
 the viewpoint one could here for 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.070
 come to rest 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.510
 over ten points
