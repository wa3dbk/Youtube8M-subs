that<00:00:33.960> let<00:00:34.200> me<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.530> take<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:34.950> temperature

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
that let me just take the temperature

heating issues in the past and we are
expecting<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.250> there<00:00:50.550> would<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.760> no<00:00:51.030> heating

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
expecting that there would be no heating

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.119 
expecting that there would be no heating
issue<00:00:51.570> with<00:00:51.719> this<00:00:51.870> device<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.039> be

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129

issue with this device but just to be
sure<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.340> are<00:00:53.579> taking<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.969> temperature

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
sure we are taking the temperature

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.869 
sure we are taking the temperature
readings<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.590> let's<00:00:55.980> start<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:56.489> subway

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879

subway surfers is running quite smoothly
on<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.079> device<00:01:37.530> and<00:01:37.920> will<00:01:38.310> simply<00:01:38.579> move<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.060> to

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
on the device and will simply move on to

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.990 
on the device and will simply move on to
a<00:01:39.299> second<00:01:39.750> game<00:01:39.960> which<00:01:40.229> would<00:01:40.470> be<00:01:40.740> asphalt<00:01:41.729> 8

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
a second game which would be asphalt 8

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.969 
a second game which would be asphalt 8
so<00:01:42.509> let's<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.869> if<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.049> device<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.590> handle<00:01:43.860> a

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
so let's see if the device can handle a

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.850 
so let's see if the device can handle a
second<00:01:44.369> game<00:01:44.520> or<00:01:44.790> not<00:01:48.020> so<00:01:49.020> here's<00:01:49.320> our<00:01:49.470> second

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
second game or not so here's our second

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.069 
second game or not so here's our second
game<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.280> Fault<00:01:50.610> 8<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.329> as<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:51.630> can<00:01:51.750> see<00:01:51.960> the

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
game is Fault 8 and as you can see the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.560 
game is Fault 8 and as you can see the
device<00:01:52.350> is<00:01:52.380> able<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.860> run<00:01:53.159> that<00:01:53.340> means<00:01:53.640> but

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
device is able to run that means but

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.240 
device is able to run that means but
there<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:54.840> minor<00:01:55.170> lag<00:01:55.500> while<00:01:55.860> playing<00:01:56.100> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
there are minor lag while playing the

there are minor lag while playing the
games<00:01:56.520> which<00:01:56.850> can<00:01:57.119> be<00:01:57.299> easily<00:01:57.420> self

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
games which can be easily self

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.859 
games which can be easily self
unfortunately<00:01:59.310> Windows<00:01:59.670> does<00:01:59.850> not<00:02:00.090> offer<00:02:00.360> to

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
unfortunately Windows does not offer to

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.010 
unfortunately Windows does not offer to
reduce<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.469> resolution<00:02:02.030> or<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.180> games

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
reduce the resolution or the games

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:12.040 
reduce the resolution or the games
optics

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050

let<00:03:04.560> me<00:03:04.709> just<00:03:04.860> not<00:03:05.069> check<00:03:05.550> the<00:03:05.700> temperature

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
let me just not check the temperature

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.729 
let me just not check the temperature
it's<00:03:07.050> 35<00:03:07.860> degrees<00:03:08.269> I'm<00:03:09.269> 37<00:03:09.840> here<00:03:10.170> so<00:03:10.620> the

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
it's 35 degrees I'm 37 here so the

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:14.060 
it's 35 degrees I'm 37 here so the
temperature<00:03:11.310> has<00:03:12.019> rise<00:03:13.019> around<00:03:13.320> 70<00:03:13.890> degree

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
temperature has rise around 70 degree

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:19.509 
temperature has rise around 70 degree
Celsius<00:03:14.579> after<00:03:15.390> giving<00:03:15.630> session<00:03:16.170> of<00:03:16.320> around

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.069 

150<00:03:20.519> minutes<00:03:21.030> a<00:03:21.180> different<00:03:21.600> attack<00:03:21.930> on

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
150 minutes a different attack on

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.949 
150 minutes a different attack on
temperature<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.620> 38<00:03:23.459> degree<00:03:23.880> Celsius<00:03:24.299> so<00:03:24.810> the

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
temperature of 38 degree Celsius so the

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:26.569 
temperature of 38 degree Celsius so the
