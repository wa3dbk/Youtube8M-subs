00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.040
 today we are supposed to 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.260
 hip arthroplasty 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.210
 joint in a patient with dysplasia 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.000
 bilateral hip dysplasia 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.220
 joint dysplasia involves not 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.869
 normal development of the joints 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.630
 they function throughout life 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.430
 wrong wear very quickly and 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.730
 no alternative to prosthetics 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.770
 exists today for 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.840
 cases of dysplasia in our arsenal 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.390
 sufficient number of endoprostheses 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.489
 who can function adequately 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.399
 all life without any wear 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.730
 we intend to put the endoprosthesis 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.230
 ceramic ceramic friction pair with 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.149
 large diameter of the femoral head 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.550
 as close as possible to your 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.859
 own anatomical size that 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.469
 allow the patient to avoid those 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.910
 restrictions that are inevitable 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.589
 accompanied patients after 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.320
 arthroplasty a few more years 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:09.260
 back incision surgery is performed normally 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.060
 in the patient's position on the side 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.370
 the first step is access to 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.580
 femur dissecting skin 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.900
 subcutaneous tissue and fascia 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.900
 simultaneously coagulates bleeding 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:28.500
 the vessels this opened you weekend deftly hips 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.560
 here she is head in this case can be seen 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.760
 that the head is completely devoid of cartilage has 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.700
 simplified form 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:41.310
 rise to ceru im oscillating thigh debt 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:43.170
 your normal healthy head should 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.660
 to be like a billiard ball absolutely 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.450
 round absolutely white shiny smooth 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:51.390
 smooth is a bare bone full 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.080
 lack of screaming here there are leftovers 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.830
 Baptism large in circumference and is 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.830
 naked subchondral bone 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.330
 develop channel femur 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.330
 follow has a rasp does 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.820
 huge body is a big piece of cartilage 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:14.190
 which was located in the joint cavity in 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:20.510
 principle did not affect anything just 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:22.590
 find we develop from above for a hollow 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:29.250
 sequential cutters to the desired 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:31.380
 the size of the cup looks like this 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.550
 standard cup for most 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.450
 cases of hip prosthetics 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.450
 the joint 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.160
 everything 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.319
 the cup wedges the acetabulum 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.760
 provides primary stability that 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.560
 and allows patients to walk already 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.160
 the day after surgery in full 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.489
 load on the leg use short 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.050
 cog is purely symbolic because 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:04.180
 there is no absolute need for it 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:06.519
 more calm now remove 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.200
 osteophytes that surround the cavity 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.600
 because they will obstruct 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.700
 normal bone motion 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.200
 growths that were previously baptized 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.420
 This is the motto of the joint cavity 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.980
 then shifted to the periphery surround 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.560
 their false contribution well just they 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.980
 often cause pain this is ceramic 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.810
 zirconia ceramic insert 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.239
 high strength allowing it to be made 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.640
 very subtle minimal threats 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:33.190
 destruction 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:37.319
 pre- prepared bed in rdr us 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.319
 channel install the leg endoprosthesis 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:42.940
 after installing the femoral component 

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:45.760
 install ceramic head 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:47.230
 appropriate size here 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.060
 ceramic head from the same 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:51.340
 the material we end up with 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.040
 ceramic friction pair which is not 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.270
 assumes virtually no wear and tear 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.100
 should serve all my life 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:04.530
 the main stage is over 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:07.110
 drain and sew wound drainage 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:11.210
 does not allow to accumulate blood after 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:11.210
 surgery in the postoperative wound itself 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:17.700
 fix the cut off from the femur 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:24.740
 muscles to their original places and in layers 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.740
 embroider ram 8g absolutely exactly 7 and 9 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.370
 the operation is finished she took a little more 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.260
 hours we installed that prosthesis which 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.030
 were supposed ceramics ceramic 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.580
 a pair of friction large anatomical 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.350
 the head of blood loss was minimal 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.900
 as intended, the operation took place 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.910
 completely nominally if everything and in 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.950
 further goes according to plan usually and 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.660
 sometimes the patient will be able to 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.690
 walk on your feet with full load 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.870
 on the feast flat foot 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.870
