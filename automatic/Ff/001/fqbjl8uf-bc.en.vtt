00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.560
 Hi everyone of the world rubber market 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.569
 This theme is 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:10.730
 I do not know the course will be here 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:13.170
 I will try to beat the stop 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:26.510
 This time's content is the basic stop 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.420
 Stop for back is for those who can do these two types 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.290
 The content is for intermediate and above 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.130
 The opponent's third ball without reading the stop course 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.980
 It is a way to gain advantage not to hit it 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.600
 I don't know the course 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.010
 The third team attack was taken by the other party 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.090
 I want you to learn by all means because it becomes a difficult element 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.060
 I think I will explain the method 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.950
 First of all, put the racket vertically vertically and vertically 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.050
 When I put it vertically, this time against the second ball I came to 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.830
 Please switch the face to the fore or back 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.320
 I can not understand the course in this changed direction 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.620
 It is a form that there are many people 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.420
 First make the fore side and enter the platform 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.320
 In making the face of the back and entering the stand 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.620
 I can predict how to hit the course to some extent 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.290
 If it is this method, it will come in and it will 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.650
 Because it switches like back 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.340
 It is very difficult for the other party to understand 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.270
 So it is very effective to seal the opponent's third ball 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.250
 As a disadvantage came to an extremely far place 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.500
 There are parts that can not be dealt with a little 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.030
 There is, but still if it is back side 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.500
 I think it is easy to do if you move 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.730
 A little more than Middle Fao 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.780
 Because it is the method that can correspond 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.640
 I think it is very effective Actually the top players also 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.030
 A player who is sometimes doing while watching during the game 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.550
 I already have enough top players to use 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.730
 It is a very effective method, so please try it 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.640
 Let's try it actually
