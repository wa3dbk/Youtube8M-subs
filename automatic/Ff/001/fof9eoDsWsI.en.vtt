electronic<00:00:21.980> puzzle<00:00:22.400> game<00:00:23.529> this<00:00:24.529> really<00:00:25.160> is<00:00:25.610> a

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:25.640 
electronic puzzle game this really is a

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.359 
electronic puzzle game this really is a
well-designed<00:00:26.630> super<00:00:27.529> simple<00:00:27.829> application

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
well-designed super simple application

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.220 
well-designed super simple application
when<00:00:28.460> I<00:00:28.489> first<00:00:28.700> opened<00:00:28.939> it<00:00:29.210> I<00:00:29.360> thought<00:00:29.960> it<00:00:30.020> was

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
when I first opened it I thought it was

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:31.929 
when I first opened it I thought it was
kind<00:00:30.439> of<00:00:30.529> silly<00:00:30.739> the<00:00:31.040> more<00:00:31.250> I<00:00:31.279> played<00:00:31.579> into<00:00:31.910> it

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
kind of silly the more I played into it

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.600 
kind of silly the more I played into it
though<00:00:32.239> it's<00:00:32.599> a<00:00:32.930> great<00:00:33.470> execution<00:00:34.070> of<00:00:34.489> a

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
though it's a great execution of a

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.200 
though it's a great execution of a
really<00:00:35.090> good<00:00:35.860> fun<00:00:36.860> game<00:00:37.340> design<00:00:37.760> that<00:00:38.000> takes

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
really good fun game design that takes

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:45.939 
really good fun game design that takes
advantage<00:00:38.390> of<00:00:38.899> these<00:00:39.110> a<00:00:39.250> old<00:00:40.960> 8-bit<00:00:44.949> 8-bit

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
advantage of these a old 8-bit 8-bit

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:49.779 
advantage of these a old 8-bit 8-bit
images<00:00:46.850> so<00:00:47.149> I'm<00:00:47.510> kind<00:00:48.230> of<00:00:48.350> far<00:00:48.559> into<00:00:49.280> it<00:00:49.309> I

00:00:49.779 --> 00:00:49.789 
images so I'm kind of far into it I

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.569 
images so I'm kind of far into it I
believe<00:00:50.530> there's<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:51.589> hundred<00:00:52.039> levels<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:52.429> as

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
believe there's a hundred levels and as

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.349 
believe there's a hundred levels and as
you<00:00:52.730> can<00:00:52.910> see<00:00:52.940> as<00:00:53.390> I<00:00:54.350> rotate<00:00:55.280> this<00:00:55.550> you<00:00:56.179> have

00:00:56.349 --> 00:00:56.359 
you can see as I rotate this you have

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:59.829 
you can see as I rotate this you have
two<00:00:56.660> separate<00:00:57.079> images<00:00:57.499> that<00:00:58.429> align<00:00:58.969> so<00:00:59.659> the

00:00:59.829 --> 00:00:59.839 
two separate images that align so the

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:05.190 
two separate images that align so the
goal<00:01:00.170> is<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.670> find<00:01:01.670> something<00:01:02.359> that<00:01:03.250> helps<00:01:04.250> you

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:05.200 
goal is to find something that helps you

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.330 
goal is to find something that helps you
to<00:01:06.200> align<00:01:06.560> these<00:01:06.830> images<00:01:07.720> appropriately

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:09.340 
to align these images appropriately

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.460 
to align these images appropriately
there<00:01:10.340> we<00:01:10.520> go<00:01:10.700> it's<00:01:11.060> fixed<00:01:11.540> I<00:01:11.720> think<00:01:12.080> I<00:01:12.170> turned

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
there we go it's fixed I think I turned

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.260 
there we go it's fixed I think I turned
the<00:01:12.680> volume<00:01:12.710> off<00:01:13.250> on<00:01:13.610> this<00:01:13.790> i'm<00:01:14.000> going<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.180> turn

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
the volume off on this i'm going to turn

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.080 
the volume off on this i'm going to turn
back<00:01:14.479> on<00:01:15.220> and<00:01:16.220> hopefully<00:01:16.430> we'll<00:01:16.790> be<00:01:16.909> all<00:01:17.060> good

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
back on and hopefully we'll be all good

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.490 
back on and hopefully we'll be all good
so<00:01:18.079> I<00:01:18.290> fixed<00:01:18.860> that<00:01:18.950> picture<00:01:19.520> I<00:01:19.700> move<00:01:20.390> into<00:01:20.869> the

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
so I fixed that picture I move into the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.030 
so I fixed that picture I move into the
next<00:01:21.710> picture<00:01:25.990> so<00:01:26.990> let's<00:01:27.229> see<00:01:27.500> I<00:01:27.530> think<00:01:27.680> she's

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
next picture so let's see I think she's

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:36.810 
next picture so let's see I think she's
supposed<00:01:28.310> to<00:01:28.369> be<00:01:28.430> climbing

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.649 

hmm<00:01:37.810> it<00:01:38.110> gets<00:01:38.409> pretty<00:01:38.560> difficult<00:01:39.330> I'll<00:01:40.330> go

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:40.659 
hmm it gets pretty difficult I'll go

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.410 
hmm it gets pretty difficult I'll go
back<00:01:40.870> and<00:01:41.140> show<00:01:41.320> you<00:01:41.670> some<00:01:42.670> of<00:01:42.700> the<00:01:42.940> earlier

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
back and show you some of the earlier

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.050 
back and show you some of the earlier
ones<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:45.250> can<00:01:45.460> kind<00:01:45.820> of<00:01:46.000> see<00:01:47.460> what<00:01:48.460> we<00:01:48.580> started

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
ones you can kind of see what we started

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.609 
ones you can kind of see what we started
at<00:01:49.240> this<00:01:49.570> one's<00:01:49.840> really<00:01:50.020> hard<00:01:50.320> because<00:01:50.470> I'm

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
at this one's really hard because I'm

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:58.940 
at this one's really hard because I'm
trying<00:01:50.890> to<00:01:50.979> figure<00:01:51.340> out<00:01:51.369> what<00:01:53.400> the<00:01:56.940> official

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
trying to figure out what the official

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.580 
trying to figure out what the official
there<00:01:59.950> we<00:02:00.220> go<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.960> yeah<00:02:02.080> it<00:02:02.200> was<00:02:02.350> all<00:02:02.470> about

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
there we go so yeah it was all about

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.400 
there we go so yeah it was all about
finding<00:02:03.009> where<00:02:03.280> the<00:02:03.310> hand<00:02:03.700> had<00:02:03.970> to<00:02:04.119> connect<00:02:04.540> so

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:05.410 
finding where the hand had to connect so

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.370 
finding where the hand had to connect so
lots<00:02:06.400> here<00:02:06.640> and<00:02:06.820> as<00:02:06.910> you<00:02:07.000> can<00:02:07.119> see<00:02:07.150> they<00:02:07.869> change

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
lots here and as you can see they change

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:11.760 
lots here and as you can see they change
it<00:02:08.619> up<00:02:08.830> as<00:02:09.479> you're<00:02:10.479> developing<00:02:10.869> these<00:02:11.410> not

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:11.770 
it up as you're developing these not

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:14.820 
it up as you're developing these not
everything<00:02:12.550> is<00:02:12.790> a<00:02:12.820> construction<00:02:13.630> seen<00:02:13.900> some

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:14.830 
everything is a construction seen some

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.229 
everything is a construction seen some
of<00:02:14.950> these<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.250> know<00:02:15.340> this<00:02:15.580> rotates<00:02:16.090> in

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
of these you know this rotates in

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.729 
of these you know this rotates in
different<00:02:16.600> directions<00:02:16.720> depending<00:02:17.350> on<00:02:17.620> how

00:02:17.729 --> 00:02:17.739 
different directions depending on how

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.590 
different directions depending on how
you<00:02:17.800> do<00:02:18.040> it<00:02:18.190> but<00:02:18.340> it's<00:02:18.700> all<00:02:18.820> these<00:02:19.060> old<00:02:19.090> 8-bit

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
you do it but it's all these old 8-bit

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.970 
you do it but it's all these old 8-bit
images<00:02:20.590> really<00:02:21.580> well<00:02:21.910> put<00:02:22.120> together<00:02:22.950> so<00:02:23.950> that

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
images really well put together so that

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.979 
images really well put together so that
you<00:02:24.250> have<00:02:24.489> the<00:02:24.670> jagged<00:02:25.120> edges<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:25.810> can

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
you have the jagged edges that you can

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.120 
you have the jagged edges that you can
see<00:02:26.200> that<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.500> can<00:02:26.650> use<00:02:26.950> to<00:02:27.420> line<00:02:28.420> up

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
see that you can use to line up

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:34.800 
see that you can use to line up
everything<00:02:30.130> so<00:02:30.340> let's<00:02:31.180> see<00:02:33.510> this<00:02:34.510> is<00:02:34.630> getting

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
everything so let's see this is getting

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.160 
everything so let's see this is getting
hard<00:02:35.140> there<00:02:35.500> we<00:02:35.560> go<00:02:37.620> so<00:02:38.620> 31<00:02:39.580> out<00:02:39.790> of<00:02:39.820> 100<00:02:40.420> this

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
hard there we go so 31 out of 100 this

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.900 
hard there we go so 31 out of 100 this
is<00:02:41.380> pretty<00:02:41.560> much<00:02:41.650> it<00:02:41.890> I<00:02:42.070> mean<00:02:42.220> this<00:02:42.340> is<00:02:42.580> what

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
is pretty much it I mean this is what

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
is pretty much it I mean this is what
you<00:02:43.209> do<00:02:43.510> in<00:02:43.930> order<00:02:44.799> to<00:02:45.130> get<00:02:46.120> this<00:02:46.330> to<00:02:46.600> go

they doing oh I see I hope that
I<00:03:04.650> need<00:03:07.499> this<00:03:10.109> to<00:03:11.109> go<00:03:11.230> somewhere<00:03:11.620> like<00:03:11.650> that<00:03:12.599> so

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
I need this to go somewhere like that so

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:20.069 
I need this to go somewhere like that so
that<00:03:14.859> is<00:03:15.010> fixed<00:03:15.370> pics<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:16.810> gets<00:03:17.349> very<00:03:19.079> very

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
that is fixed pics it gets very very

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:24.240 
that is fixed pics it gets very very
difficult<00:03:20.530> as<00:03:22.319> you<00:03:23.319> get<00:03:23.500> further<00:03:23.709> into<00:03:24.010> the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
difficult as you get further into the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.589 
difficult as you get further into the
game<00:03:25.290> let's<00:03:26.310> see<00:03:27.310> if<00:03:27.430> I<00:03:27.549> can<00:03:27.730> get<00:03:27.879> out<00:03:27.939> of<00:03:28.120> here

game let's see if I can get out of here

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:32.220 
game let's see if I can get out of here
now<00:03:29.310> it's<00:03:30.310> fairly<00:03:31.090> straightforward<00:03:31.269> it

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
now it's fairly straightforward it

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.319 
now it's fairly straightforward it
appears<00:03:32.650> as<00:03:32.919> far<00:03:33.219> as<00:03:33.459> options<00:03:34.030> i'm<00:03:34.150> going<00:03:34.269> to

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
appears as far as options i'm going to

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.899 
appears as far as options i'm going to

the details on what happens when you get
through<00:04:07.269> the<00:04:07.389> sky<00:04:07.569> but<00:04:07.750> for<00:04:07.900> now<00:04:08.019> it's<00:04:08.769> a<00:04:08.859> great

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
through the sky but for now it's a great

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.219 
through the sky but for now it's a great
little<00:04:09.909> application<00:04:10.540> really<00:04:11.379> good<00:04:11.560> design<00:04:11.919> to

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:13.229 
little application really good design to

00:04:13.229 --> 00:04:17.719 
little application really good design to
show<00:04:14.229> off<00:04:14.439> these<00:04:14.650> this<00:04:15.099> 8-bit<00:04:15.430> imagery<00:04:16.299> and

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
show off these this 8-bit imagery and

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.890 
show off these this 8-bit imagery and
the<00:04:18.729> only<00:04:18.880> thing<00:04:18.970> I<00:04:19.180> would<00:04:19.329> say<00:04:19.359> about<00:04:19.509> it<00:04:19.810> is

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
the only thing I would say about it is

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.080 
the only thing I would say about it is
it<00:04:20.079> is<00:04:20.199> a<00:04:20.229> dollar<00:04:20.530> ninety-nine<00:04:21.190> it<00:04:21.459> really

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
it is a dollar ninety-nine it really

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.980 
it is a dollar ninety-nine it really
feels<00:04:22.419> like<00:04:22.509> a<00:04:22.630> 99-cent<00:04:23.110> app<00:04:23.530> so<00:04:24.659> if<00:04:25.659> a<00:04:25.810> dollar

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
feels like a 99-cent app so if a dollar

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.390 
feels like a 99-cent app so if a dollar
ninety-nine<00:04:26.409> is<00:04:26.530> too<00:04:26.650> much<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.949> spend<00:04:27.159> for<00:04:27.310> an

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:27.400 
ninety-nine is too much to spend for an

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.219 
ninety-nine is too much to spend for an
app<00:04:27.490> like<00:04:27.520> this<00:04:27.880> I<00:04:28.120> can<00:04:28.570> kind<00:04:28.870> of<00:04:28.930> see<00:04:29.080> where

00:04:29.219 --> 00:04:29.229
