north<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:09.260> south<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.470> this<00:01:10.619> channel<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.130> I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
north to south in this channel but I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.219 
north to south in this channel but I
have<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.369> strong<00:01:11.700> crosswind<00:01:12.659> that's<00:01:12.869> actually

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
have a strong crosswind that's actually

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.410 
have a strong crosswind that's actually
pushing<00:01:13.590> me<00:01:13.680> west<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.220> east<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.820> that<00:01:15.270> has

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
pushing me west to east and that has

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.179 
pushing me west to east and that has
completely<00:01:15.780> screwed<00:01:16.500> up<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> drift<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.100> what

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
completely screwed up the drift so what

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.530 
completely screwed up the drift so what
I'm<00:01:17.280> trying<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.549> do<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.790> compensate<00:01:18.000> I'm

trying<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.840> cast<00:01:19.110> up<00:01:20.009> north<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.970> try<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.330> work

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
trying to cast up north and try to work

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.960

that buck tail back to the south and the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.520 
that buck tail back to the south and the
direction<00:01:24.420> that<00:01:24.509> it<00:01:24.659> should<00:01:24.869> be<00:01:25.020> moving<00:01:25.350> if

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
direction that it should be moving if

direction that it should be moving if
the<00:01:25.740> drift<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.130> working<00:01:26.490> properly<00:01:26.670> so<00:01:27.829> after

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
the drift is working properly so after

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.859 
the drift is working properly so after

well 20 inch fish and a good start

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.880 
well 20 inch fish and a good start
so<00:02:10.120> basically<00:02:10.390> what<00:02:10.570> I<00:02:10.630> did<00:02:10.690> is<00:02:10.810> um<00:02:11.080> I<00:02:11.500> just

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
so basically what I did is um I just

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.120 
so basically what I did is um I just
reset<00:02:12.700> on<00:02:12.820> the<00:02:12.940> same<00:02:13.120> drift<00:02:13.360> again<00:02:13.830> I'm<00:02:14.830> real

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
reset on the same drift again I'm real

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:16.590 
reset on the same drift again I'm real
shallow<00:02:15.460> over<00:02:15.730> here<00:02:16.000> I'm<00:02:16.150> probably<00:02:16.300> in<00:02:16.540> about

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
shallow over here I'm probably in about

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.960 
shallow over here I'm probably in about
10<00:02:16.870> feet<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.200> water<00:02:17.520> already<00:02:18.520> started<00:02:18.910> this

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
drift in about 20 feet of water and it's

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.840 
drift in about 20 feet of water and it's
a<00:02:23.650> little<00:02:23.830> tricky<00:02:24.130> to<00:02:24.160> get<00:02:24.310> used<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.550> that<00:02:24.670> hook

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
a little tricky to get used to that hook

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.060 
a little tricky to get used to that hook
set<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.330> the<00:02:25.420> fluke<00:02:25.660> on<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:25.900> kayak<00:02:26.260> it's<00:02:26.860> all

always net head first it's sometimes
tough<00:02:51.580> to<00:02:51.880> get<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.240> right<00:02:52.390> angle<00:02:52.600> especially

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:52.960 
tough to get the right angle especially

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.160 
tough to get the right angle especially
when<00:02:53.320> you're<00:02:53.410> getting<00:02:53.470> pushed<00:02:53.800> with<00:02:54.070> wind<00:02:55.170> but

when you're getting pushed with wind but

when you're getting pushed with wind but
just<00:02:56.620> be<00:02:56.770> patient<00:02:56.980> keep<00:02:57.490> that<00:02:57.700> flukes<00:02:57.970> head<00:02:58.180> on

just be patient keep that flukes head on
the<00:02:58.480> water

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
the water

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.140 
the water
that's<00:02:59.170> an<00:02:59.290> easy<00:02:59.560> way<00:02:59.920> people<00:03:00.280> drop<00:03:00.550> fluke<00:03:00.850> is

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
that's an easy way people drop fluke is

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.940 
that's an easy way people drop fluke is
that<00:03:01.720> they<00:03:01.810> let<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.080> head<00:03:02.230> come<00:03:02.260> above<00:03:02.740> water

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
that they let the head come above water

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.380 
that they let the head come above water
they<00:03:03.160> start<00:03:03.430> shaking<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:03.910> they<00:03:04.060> could<00:03:04.210> shake

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
they start shaking and they could shake

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.350 
they start shaking and they could shake
the<00:03:04.510> bucktail<00:03:04.870> right<00:03:05.080> out<00:03:05.230> back<00:03:05.440> at<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:05.830> and

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
the bucktail right out back at you and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.760 
the bucktail right out back at you and
this<00:03:07.360> is<00:03:07.510> basically<00:03:07.810> how<00:03:07.930> I<00:03:08.050> store<00:03:08.380> my<00:03:08.530> flukes

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
this is basically how I store my flukes

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.680 
this is basically how I store my flukes
sometimes<00:03:09.220> sometimes<00:03:09.730> I<00:03:09.820> carry<00:03:10.000> cool<00:03:10.330> with<00:03:10.570> me

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
sometimes sometimes I carry cool with me

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.200 
sometimes sometimes I carry cool with me
sometimes<00:03:11.140> I<00:03:11.380> go<00:03:12.310> with<00:03:12.460> the<00:03:12.580> fish<00:03:12.790> stringer

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.210 
sometimes I go with the fish stringer

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.150 
sometimes I go with the fish stringer
depends<00:03:13.540> how<00:03:13.630> far<00:03:13.840> I<00:03:13.900> am<00:03:14.080> from<00:03:14.230> the<00:03:14.500> launch<00:03:14.710> if

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
depends how far I am from the launch if

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.110 
depends how far I am from the launch if
we're<00:03:15.340> going<00:03:15.460> to<00:03:15.520> be<00:03:15.580> targeting<00:03:16.000> other

we're going to be targeting other
species<00:03:16.420> for<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.810> day<00:03:16.960> but<00:03:17.860> those<00:03:18.160> fish

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
species for the day but those fish

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:19.470 
species for the day but those fish
Turner's<00:03:18.760> are<00:03:18.820> pretty<00:03:19.000> convenient

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
Turner's are pretty convenient

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.150 
Turner's are pretty convenient
alright<00:03:20.170> here's<00:03:20.620> just<00:03:20.830> one<00:03:20.980> more<00:03:21.130> fish<00:03:21.780> you

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
alright here's just one more fish you

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.550 
alright here's just one more fish you
can<00:03:24.160> see<00:03:24.340> I'm<00:03:24.490> basically<00:03:25.180> actually<00:03:25.540> did<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:26.080> cut

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
can see I'm basically actually did I cut

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.220 
can see I'm basically actually did I cut
the<00:03:26.680> cast<00:03:26.890> out<00:03:27.190> but<00:03:27.340> I<00:03:27.400> cast<00:03:27.670> it<00:03:28.230> basically

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
the cast out but I cast it basically

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.100 
the cast out but I cast it basically
just<00:03:29.320> slowly<00:03:29.800> working<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.400> buff<00:03:30.580> tail<00:03:30.790> back

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110 
just slowly working the buff tail back

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.810 
just slowly working the buff tail back
to<00:03:32.110> the<00:03:32.200> kayak<00:03:32.410> trying<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.280> present<00:03:33.460> it<00:03:33.730> as

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
to the kayak trying to present it as

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:35.730 
to the kayak trying to present it as
naturally<00:03:34.420> as<00:03:34.450> possible<00:03:34.570> with<00:03:35.230> that<00:03:35.440> wind

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:35.740 
naturally as possible with that wind

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.500 
naturally as possible with that wind
drift<00:03:35.950> this<00:03:36.220> is<00:03:36.370> a<00:03:36.430> typical<00:03:36.850> situation<00:03:36.970> and

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
drift this is a typical situation and

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.870 
drift this is a typical situation and
back<00:03:37.690> bait<00:03:37.930> fishing<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:39.040> winds<00:03:39.640> are<00:03:39.760> gonna

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
back bait fishing that winds are gonna

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.000 
back bait fishing that winds are gonna
determine<00:03:40.360> you<00:03:40.600> drift<00:03:40.870> quite<00:03:41.110> a<00:03:41.140> bit<00:03:41.410> that<00:03:41.830> the

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
determine you drift quite a bit that the

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.350 
determine you drift quite a bit that the
car<00:03:42.250> might<00:03:42.490> not<00:03:42.610> be<00:03:42.760> strong<00:03:42.940> enough<00:03:43.300> to

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
car might not be strong enough to

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.910 
car might not be strong enough to
compensate<00:03:44.170> for<00:03:44.350> the<00:03:44.470> wind<00:03:44.650> direction

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.240 

alright
