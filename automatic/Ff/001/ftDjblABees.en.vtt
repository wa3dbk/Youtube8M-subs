the dev preview we'll just let it boot
in<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.260> i'll<00:00:43.410> log<00:00:43.590> into<00:00:43.860> the<00:00:43.950> account<00:00:43.980> that

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
in and i'll log into the account that

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.310 
in and i'll log into the account that
I've<00:00:44.520> created<00:00:44.730> I've<00:00:45.510> given<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.870> half<00:00:46.110> my

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
I've created I've given it half my

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.200 
I've created I've given it half my
resources<00:00:46.920> here<00:00:47.070> for<00:00:47.309> gigs<00:00:47.520> of<00:00:47.670> ram<00:00:47.850> and<00:00:47.879> two

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
resources here for gigs of ram and two

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.209 
resources here for gigs of ram and two
cores<00:00:48.480> at<00:00:48.690> 2.2<00:00:49.230> gigahertz<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.010> pretty

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
cores at 2.2 gigahertz so it's pretty

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.090 
cores at 2.2 gigahertz so it's pretty
quick<00:00:50.550> we'll<00:00:51.059> let<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.210> log<00:00:51.420> into<00:00:51.660> this<00:00:51.750> account

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
quick we'll let it log into this account

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.500 
quick we'll let it log into this account
okay<00:00:53.100> I<00:00:53.129> actually<00:00:53.309> had<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.699> reboot<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.270> there

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
okay I actually had to reboot it there

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.020 
okay I actually had to reboot it there
it<00:00:54.660> got<00:00:54.899> me<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.890> step<00:00:56.280> just<00:00:56.520> before<00:00:56.879> this

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
it got me to the step just before this

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.729 
it got me to the step just before this
and<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:57.390> pretty<00:00:57.660> much<00:00:57.780> committed<00:00:58.469> suicide

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and then pretty much committed suicide

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.889 
and then pretty much committed suicide
i'm<00:00:59.190> going<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.820> see<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.090> i<00:01:00.180> can<00:01:00.329> put<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:00.600> in<00:01:00.660> full

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
i'm going to see if i can put it in full

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.510 
i'm going to see if i can put it in full
screen<00:01:01.109> mode<00:01:01.289> so<00:01:01.649> we<00:01:01.710> can<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:01.980> a<00:01:02.010> better<00:01:02.070> view

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
screen mode so we can get a better view

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.479 
screen mode so we can get a better view
if<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:03.719> click<00:01:03.930> on<00:01:04.080> desktop<00:01:04.710> there<00:01:05.100> maybe<00:01:05.339> you

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
if we click on desktop there maybe you

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.399 
if we click on desktop there maybe you
have<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.700> change<00:01:05.939> our<00:01:06.090> resolution<00:01:06.689> looks<00:01:07.170> just

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
have to change our resolution looks just

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.960 
have to change our resolution looks just
like<00:01:07.530> windows<00:01:07.680> 7<00:01:08.220> from<00:01:08.369> here<00:01:08.640> i'm<00:01:08.729> going<00:01:08.850> to<00:01:08.909> go

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
like windows 7 from here i'm going to go

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.570 
like windows 7 from here i'm going to go
ahead<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.119> bump<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.659> res<00:01:10.130> see<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.430> will

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
ahead and bump that res see if this will

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.140 
ahead and bump that res see if this will
fit<00:01:12.229> virtualized<00:01:14.600> apply<00:01:16.549> it's<00:01:17.549> a<00:01:17.670> little<00:01:17.880> tall

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
fit virtualized apply it's a little tall

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.359 
fit virtualized apply it's a little tall
will<00:01:18.720> downscale<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.409> again<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:19.979> we<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.189> see

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
will downscale that again so we can see

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.289 
will downscale that again so we can see
the<00:01:20.520> whole<00:01:20.670> thing<00:01:20.729> or<00:01:21.180> at<00:01:21.509> least<00:01:21.750> more<00:01:21.990> of<00:01:22.110> it

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
the whole thing or at least more of it

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.760 
the whole thing or at least more of it
there<00:01:24.299> we<00:01:24.420> go<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:25.110> looks<00:01:25.140> like<00:01:25.439> it's<00:01:25.650> going

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
there we go that looks like it's going

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.359 
there we go that looks like it's going
to<00:01:25.830> fit<00:01:26.009> so<00:01:26.580> from<00:01:27.210> our<00:01:27.860> desktop<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.100> it

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
to fit so from our desktop here it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.060 
to fit so from our desktop here it
really<00:01:29.670> looks<00:01:30.000> just<00:01:30.930> about<00:01:31.049> like<00:01:31.290> Windows<00:01:31.680> 7

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
really looks just about like Windows 7

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.460 
really looks just about like Windows 7
of<00:01:32.939> course<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.299> click<00:01:33.630> networks<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.290> get

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
of course you click networks and you get

office 2007 2010 and now they've
integrated<00:01:57.000> this<00:01:57.360> into<00:01:57.420> Explorer<00:01:58.140> which<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.969> i

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
integrated this into Explorer which is i

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.749 
integrated this into Explorer which is i

guess<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.350> can<00:02:07.500> see<00:02:07.799> everything<00:02:08.220> there<00:02:08.429> its

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
guess you can see everything there its

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.669 
guess you can see everything there its
most<00:02:08.849> everything<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.390> is<00:02:09.599> here<00:02:09.959> is<00:02:10.289> now

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
most everything that is here is now

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.229 
most everything that is here is now
up<00:02:10.769> there<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.310> you<00:02:11.370> can<00:02:11.519> see<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.849> all<00:02:11.969> at<00:02:12.090> one

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
up there so you can see it all at one

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.420 
up there so you can see it all at one
time<00:02:12.269> my<00:02:13.079> philosophy<00:02:13.260> is<00:02:13.650> kind<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.069> the<00:02:14.129> apple

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
time my philosophy is kind of the apple

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.130 
time my philosophy is kind of the apple
way<00:02:14.519> why<00:02:14.730> have<00:02:15.000> all<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.239> crap<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:15.629> there<00:02:15.870> if

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
way why have all that crap up there if

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.959 
way why have all that crap up there if
you<00:02:16.560> don't<00:02:16.709> need<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.099> when<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.400> do<00:02:17.519> need<00:02:17.700> it<00:02:17.819> it

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:17.969 
you don't need it when you do need it it

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:19.580 
you don't need it when you do need it it
is<00:02:18.090> one<00:02:18.390> click<00:02:18.659> away<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:19.200> then<00:02:19.319> you<00:02:19.409> select

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
is one click away and then you select

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.140 
is one click away and then you select
what<00:02:19.829> you<00:02:19.859> want<00:02:19.980> so<00:02:20.430> why<00:02:20.549> put<00:02:20.760> everything<00:02:20.939> up

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
what you want so why put everything up

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.679 
what you want so why put everything up
there<00:02:21.329> and<00:02:21.480> always<00:02:21.629> see<00:02:21.989> it<00:02:22.109> I<00:02:22.290> don't<00:02:22.709> know<00:02:23.689> but

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
there and always see it I don't know but

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.830 
there and always see it I don't know but
there<00:02:24.810> it<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:24.989> so<00:02:25.349> you<00:02:25.680> have<00:02:25.890> this<00:02:26.159> now<00:02:26.430> in

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
there it is so you have this now in

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.330 
there it is so you have this now in
Explorer<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:28.319> well<00:02:28.530> as<00:02:28.650> these<00:02:28.769> different<00:02:29.069> tabs

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
Explorer as well as these different tabs

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.589 
Explorer as well as these different tabs
up<00:02:29.609> here<00:02:29.639> so<00:02:29.909> I<00:02:29.969> guess<00:02:30.120> there's<00:02:30.389> more

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
up here so I guess there's more

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.750 
up here so I guess there's more
information<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.829> then<00:02:31.889> the<00:02:32.069> file<00:02:32.370> window

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
information and then the file window

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.879 
information and then the file window
there<00:02:32.969> that<00:02:33.959> really<00:02:34.170> looks<00:02:34.439> like<00:02:34.590> it's<00:02:34.739> right

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:34.889 
there that really looks like it's right

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:37.459 
there that really looks like it's right
out<00:02:34.950> of<00:02:35.069> office<00:02:35.489> it's<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.879> the<00:02:36.030> same<00:02:36.469> idea

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:37.469 
out of office it's just the same idea

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.309 
out of office it's just the same idea
behind<00:02:37.859> office<00:02:38.370> 10<00:02:38.939> and<00:02:39.150> no<00:02:39.269> seven<00:02:39.540> if<00:02:40.019> we<00:02:40.109> come

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
behind office 10 and no seven if we come

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.440 
behind office 10 and no seven if we come
over<00:02:40.349> here<00:02:40.590> to<00:02:40.620> our<00:02:40.709> Start<00:02:41.040> menu<00:02:41.370> we<00:02:42.120> get<00:02:42.269> this

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
over here to our Start menu we get this

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.629 
over here to our Start menu we get this
garbage<00:02:42.659> which<00:02:43.139> quite<00:02:43.739> frankly<00:02:43.829> I<00:02:44.159> don't<00:02:44.250> like

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
garbage which quite frankly I don't like

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.460 
garbage which quite frankly I don't like
we<00:02:44.879> can<00:02:44.909> go<00:02:45.090> into<00:02:45.209> our<00:02:45.359> control<00:02:45.780> panel<00:02:46.169> here

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
we can go into our control panel here

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.830 
we can go into our control panel here
there<00:02:47.280> a<00:02:47.459> lot<00:02:47.519> of<00:02:47.849> full<00:02:48.030> screen<00:02:48.299> apps<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.629> wonder

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
there a lot of full screen apps I wonder

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.089 
there a lot of full screen apps I wonder
where<00:02:48.959> they<00:02:49.049> got<00:02:49.169> this<00:02:49.319> idea<00:02:49.530> all<00:02:49.799> the<00:02:49.919> stuff

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
where they got this idea all the stuff

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.369 
where they got this idea all the stuff
on<00:02:50.250> the<00:02:50.280> left<00:02:50.579> maybe<00:02:51.209> from<00:02:51.540> iOS<00:02:52.109> there's

00:02:52.369 --> 00:02:52.379 
on the left maybe from iOS there's

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:53.839 
on the left maybe from iOS there's
something<00:02:52.590> like<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.889> may<00:02:53.129> be<00:02:53.189> but<00:02:53.790> there's

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
something like that may be but there's

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:55.640 
something like that may be but there's
our<00:02:54.090> notification<00:02:54.689> so<00:02:54.840> we<00:02:54.930> can<00:02:55.079> turn<00:02:55.230> stuff<00:02:55.439> on

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
our notification so we can turn stuff on

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.589 
our notification so we can turn stuff on
and<00:02:55.859> off<00:02:55.950> that<00:02:56.219> also<00:02:56.549> looks<00:02:56.730> pretty<00:02:57.359> familiar

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
and off that also looks pretty familiar

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:00.470 
and off that also looks pretty familiar
with<00:02:57.930> iOS<00:02:58.560> it's<00:02:58.799> just<00:02:59.280> a<00:02:59.400> more<00:02:59.819> hideous<00:03:00.030> green

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
with iOS it's just a more hideous green

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.750 
with iOS it's just a more hideous green
version<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:01.049> it<00:03:01.139> general<00:03:02.099> information<00:03:02.219> there

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
version of it general information there

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.220 
version of it general information there
are<00:03:02.819> some<00:03:02.969> decent<00:03:03.120> animations<00:03:03.780> here<00:03:03.989> I'll

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
are some decent animations here I'll

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.270 
are some decent animations here I'll
give<00:03:04.379> him<00:03:04.469> that<00:03:04.500> they<00:03:04.829> figured<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.250> out

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
give him that they figured that out

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.520 
give him that they figured that out
homegroup<00:03:06.120> something<00:03:06.629> we<00:03:06.719> had<00:03:06.840> windows<00:03:07.169> 7

homegroup something we had windows 7

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.890 
homegroup something we had windows 7
windows<00:03:07.680> update<00:03:08.489> something<00:03:08.760> we've<00:03:09.209> had<00:03:09.450> for<00:03:09.870> a

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
windows update something we've had for a

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.500 
windows update something we've had for a
long<00:03:09.930> time<00:03:10.370> general<00:03:11.370> options<00:03:11.549> I<00:03:11.849> mean<00:03:12.000> this<00:03:12.090> is

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
long time general options I mean this is

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:13.759 
long time general options I mean this is
just<00:03:12.540> our<00:03:12.750> control<00:03:13.079> panel<00:03:13.379> so<00:03:13.500> if<00:03:13.560> we<00:03:13.650> would

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:13.769 
just our control panel so if we would

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:15.559 
just our control panel so if we would
want<00:03:14.099> to<00:03:14.159> go<00:03:14.250> back<00:03:14.459> out<00:03:14.669> of<00:03:14.760> here<00:03:15.180> the<00:03:15.299> only<00:03:15.449> way

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
want to go back out of here the only way

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.559 
want to go back out of here the only way
I<00:03:15.599> figured<00:03:16.109> out<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.729> does<00:03:17.729> it<00:03:17.849> right<00:03:18.120> command

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
I figured out is does it right command

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:19.909 
I figured out is does it right command
the<00:03:18.720> key<00:03:18.870> which<00:03:19.049> would<00:03:19.199> be<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.409> right<00:03:19.530> windows

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:19.919 
the key which would be the right windows

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.280 
the key which would be the right windows
key<00:03:20.190> if<00:03:20.310> you're<00:03:20.459> on<00:03:20.549> a<00:03:20.609> PC<00:03:21.120> I'm<00:03:22.019> going<00:03:22.229> to

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729 
in the developer preview but I'm sure it

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.479 
in the developer preview but I'm sure it
will<00:04:14.819> be<00:04:14.879> soon<00:04:15.470> stocks<00:04:16.470> will<00:04:16.889> see<00:04:17.039> how<00:04:17.190> badly

it<00:04:17.789> was<00:04:18.060> today<00:04:18.239> I<00:04:18.329> think<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:18.630> was<00:04:18.719> down<00:04:18.930> 400

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
it was today I think it was down 400

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.040 
it was today I think it was down 400
391<00:04:21.130> but<00:04:21.550> you<00:04:22.000> know<00:04:22.120> I'll<00:04:22.420> be<00:04:22.570> honest<00:04:22.840> this<00:04:22.900> is

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
391 but you know I'll be honest this is

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.780 
391 but you know I'll be honest this is
pretty<00:04:23.320> decent<00:04:23.440> stock<00:04:23.830> graph<00:04:24.100> here<00:04:24.370> it's<00:04:24.550> a

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
pretty decent stock graph here it's a

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.030 
pretty decent stock graph here it's a
little<00:04:25.720> big<00:04:25.840> again<00:04:26.020> I<00:04:26.260> don't<00:04:26.410> think<00:04:26.740> that<00:04:26.890> we

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
little big again I don't think that we

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.160 
little big again I don't think that we
need<00:04:27.070> to<00:04:27.190> see<00:04:27.430> this<00:04:27.580> entire<00:04:27.970> thing<00:04:28.330> and<00:04:28.600> the

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
need to see this entire thing and the

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:30.810 
need to see this entire thing and the
horizontal<00:04:29.590> scrolling<00:04:30.130> is<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.430> bit<00:04:30.610> awkward

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
horizontal scrolling is a bit awkward

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.410 
horizontal scrolling is a bit awkward
but<00:04:32.220> i'll<00:04:33.220> set<00:04:33.550> it<00:04:33.580> before<00:04:33.730> I<00:04:33.910> set<00:04:34.120> it<00:04:34.210> again

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
but i'll set it before I set it again

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.840 
but i'll set it before I set it again
I'll<00:04:34.570> say<00:04:34.780> it<00:04:34.840> again<00:04:34.900> this<00:04:35.290> is<00:04:35.470> all<00:04:35.740> of<00:04:36.130> preview

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.720 
I'll say it again this is all of preview
so<00:04:37.150> just<00:04:37.720> a<00:04:37.870> little<00:04:38.100> preview<00:04:39.100> of<00:04:39.340> what<00:04:39.490> we<00:04:39.610> can

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
so just a little preview of what we can

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.120

expect did come with some application to
this<00:04:42.340> remote<00:04:42.580> desktop<00:04:43.380> honestly<00:04:44.380> I<00:04:44.500> just

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.210 
this remote desktop honestly I just
really<00:04:44.980> don't<00:04:45.100> like<00:04:45.220> this<00:04:45.490> interface<00:04:45.970> how

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:47.220 
really don't like this interface how

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:49.770 
really don't like this interface how
there's<00:04:48.220> big<00:04:48.490> blocks<00:04:48.820> there's<00:04:49.150> small<00:04:49.450> blocks

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
there's big blocks there's small blocks

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.410 
there's big blocks there's small blocks
why<00:04:50.080> why<00:04:50.770> are<00:04:51.070> these<00:04:51.370> two<00:04:51.670> small<00:04:52.030> and<00:04:52.270> that

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
why why are these two small and that

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:53.760 
why why are these two small and that
one's<00:04:52.630> huge<00:04:52.930> that<00:04:53.140> just<00:04:53.320> doesn't<00:04:53.500> make<00:04:53.710> sense

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
one's huge that just doesn't make sense

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.580 
one's huge that just doesn't make sense
to<00:04:54.160> me<00:04:54.280> it<00:04:54.880> just<00:04:54.940> seems<00:04:55.180> really<00:04:55.600> unorganized<00:04:56.050> I

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
to me it just seems really unorganized I

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.410 
to me it just seems really unorganized I
didn't<00:04:56.860> like<00:04:57.040> Windows<00:04:57.370> Phone<00:04:57.610> 7<00:04:58.000> and<00:04:58.150> I<00:04:58.210> don't

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
didn't like Windows Phone 7 and I don't

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.880 
didn't like Windows Phone 7 and I don't
like<00:04:58.600> this<00:04:58.870> and<00:04:59.110> I<00:04:59.230> don't<00:04:59.380> like<00:04:59.650> how<00:04:59.830> the

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
like this and I don't like how the

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.030 
like this and I don't like how the
desktop<00:05:00.400> is<00:05:00.610> now<00:05:00.790> an<00:05:00.940> application<00:05:01.570> but<00:05:02.260> one

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
desktop is now an application but one

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.920 
desktop is now an application but one
more<00:05:03.220> time<00:05:03.490> this<00:05:04.000> is<00:05:04.150> the<00:05:04.300> Developer<00:05:04.780> Preview

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
more time this is the Developer Preview

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:09.030 
more time this is the Developer Preview
not<00:05:05.380> something<00:05:06.990> that<00:05:07.990> is<00:05:08.020> going<00:05:08.170> to<00:05:08.620> be<00:05:08.710> final

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
not something that is going to be final

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:10.680 
not something that is going to be final
it's<00:05:09.430> just<00:05:09.610> a<00:05:09.730> little<00:05:09.880> idea<00:05:10.210> I<00:05:10.390> have<00:05:10.570> not

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
it's just a little idea I have not

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.540 
it's just a little idea I have not
figured<00:05:10.900> out<00:05:11.080> how<00:05:11.260> to<00:05:11.320> shut<00:05:11.410> it<00:05:11.650> down<00:05:11.680> that's<00:05:12.400> a

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:12.550 
figured out how to shut it down that's a

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:14.730 
figured out how to shut it down that's a
problem<00:05:12.790> that<00:05:13.030> users<00:05:13.330> may<00:05:13.540> have<00:05:13.810> we<00:05:14.350> can<00:05:14.530> lock

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:14.740 
problem that users may have we can lock

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.770 
problem that users may have we can lock
and<00:05:15.010> log<00:05:15.220> off<00:05:15.430> change<00:05:15.880> user<00:05:16.150> thailand<00:05:16.660> add

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
and log off change user thailand add

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.900 
and log off change user thailand add
user<00:05:17.170> by<00:05:17.410> clicking<00:05:17.800> up<00:05:17.920> there<00:05:18.160> but<00:05:18.580> we<00:05:18.700> can't

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
user by clicking up there but we can't

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.220 
user by clicking up there but we can't
shut<00:05:19.210> down<00:05:19.270> so<00:05:19.660> i<00:05:19.690> guess<00:05:19.840> we're<00:05:19.960> gonna<00:05:20.020> have<00:05:20.140> to

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:20.230 
shut down so i guess we're gonna have to

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.170 
shut down so i guess we're gonna have to
click<00:05:20.440> log<00:05:20.680> off<00:05:20.920> first<00:05:21.250> maybe<00:05:21.820> it'll<00:05:21.970> take<00:05:22.150> us

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
click log off first maybe it'll take us

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.520 
click log off first maybe it'll take us
back<00:05:22.420> to<00:05:22.450> some<00:05:22.750> sort<00:05:22.930> of<00:05:22.960> a<00:05:23.050> welcome<00:05:23.410> screen

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:23.530 
back to some sort of a welcome screen

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:25.200 
back to some sort of a welcome screen
and<00:05:23.860> then<00:05:23.950> from<00:05:24.070> there<00:05:24.130> you<00:05:24.490> should<00:05:25.000> be<00:05:25.120> able

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
and then from there you should be able

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.450 
and then from there you should be able
to<00:05:25.360> shut<00:05:25.570> down<00:05:26.040> all<00:05:27.040> right<00:05:27.190> well<00:05:27.340> I've<00:05:27.400> been

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:27.460 
to shut down all right well I've been

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.370 
to shut down all right well I've been
waiting<00:05:27.850> for<00:05:28.030> this<00:05:28.120> forever<00:05:28.510> and<00:05:28.780> it<00:05:29.050> doesn't

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
waiting for this forever and it doesn't

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.480 
waiting for this forever and it doesn't
look<00:05:29.440> like<00:05:29.620> it's<00:05:29.740> doing<00:05:29.920> anything<00:05:30.220> I<00:05:30.430> think

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:30.490 
look like it's doing anything I think

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:32.460 
look like it's doing anything I think
it's<00:05:30.760> locked<00:05:31.030> up<00:05:31.180> again<00:05:31.360> maybe<00:05:31.690> it's<00:05:31.900> my<00:05:32.050> copy

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
it's locked up again maybe it's my copy

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.780 
it's locked up again maybe it's my copy
maybe<00:05:32.710> it's<00:05:32.860> just<00:05:32.920> the<00:05:33.100> fact<00:05:33.280> that<00:05:33.460> it's<00:05:33.670> so

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
maybe it's just the fact that it's so

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.310 
maybe it's just the fact that it's so
early<00:05:33.940> in<00:05:34.120> development<00:05:34.240> but<00:05:34.900> I'm<00:05:35.020> just<00:05:35.140> going

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
early in development but I'm just going

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.890 
early in development but I'm just going
to<00:05:35.350> go<00:05:35.410> up<00:05:35.560> here<00:05:35.920> and<00:05:36.010> and<00:05:36.850> kill<00:05:37.600> it<00:05:37.720> with<00:05:37.870> a

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 
to go up here and and kill it with a

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.170 
to go up here and and kill it with a
shutdown<00:05:38.290> but<00:05:39.070> that's<00:05:39.430> the<00:05:39.610> basic<00:05:39.730> look<00:05:40.120> of

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
shutdown but that's the basic look of

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.300 
shutdown but that's the basic look of
what<00:05:40.870> this<00:05:41.020> looks<00:05:41.260> like<00:05:41.320> again<00:05:41.770> it's<00:05:41.920> free<00:05:42.190> to

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
what this looks like again it's free to

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:45.210 
what this looks like again it's free to
anybody<00:05:42.640> anybody<00:05:43.060> can<00:05:43.270> go<00:05:43.480> and<00:05:43.830> download<00:05:44.830> this

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
anybody anybody can go and download this

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.590 
anybody anybody can go and download this
and<00:05:45.430> install<00:05:45.700> it<00:05:45.820> in<00:05:45.910> a<00:05:45.970> virtual<00:05:46.270> machine<00:05:46.300> and

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
and install it in a virtual machine and

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.120 
and install it in a virtual machine and
see<00:05:46.870> what<00:05:46.990> they<00:05:47.110> think<00:05:47.140> of<00:05:47.440> it<00:05:47.560> make<00:05:47.860> a<00:05:47.890> video

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:48.130 
see what they think of it make a video

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.980 
see what they think of it make a video
response<00:05:48.430> if<00:05:48.850> you've<00:05:49.000> used<00:05:49.270> it<00:05:49.510> or<00:05:49.660> installed

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:49.990 
response if you've used it or installed

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:51.630 
response if you've used it or installed
it<00:05:50.140> and<00:05:50.170> let<00:05:50.680> me<00:05:50.770> know<00:05:50.800> what<00:05:51.040> you<00:05:51.220> think<00:05:51.400> of<00:05:51.520> it

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
it and let me know what you think of it

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.940 
it and let me know what you think of it
so<00:05:51.700> far<00:05:51.850> as<00:05:52.270> I<00:05:52.480> said<00:05:53.020> a<00:05:53.050> million<00:05:53.320> times<00:05:53.440> it's

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
so far as I said a million times it's

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.410 
so far as I said a million times it's
way<00:05:54.220> too<00:05:54.280> early<00:05:54.460> to<00:05:54.790> tell<00:05:54.970> what<00:05:55.150> it's<00:05:55.300> actually

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
way too early to tell what it's actually

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:57.620 
way too early to tell what it's actually
going<00:05:55.720> to<00:05:55.780> be<00:05:55.840> like<00:05:56.140> but<00:05:56.800> it<00:05:57.040> just<00:05:57.190> feels

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630 
going to be like but it just feels

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:59.790 
going to be like but it just feels
really<00:05:58.630> early<00:05:59.080> in<00:05:59.110> the<00:05:59.260> stages<00:05:59.650> of

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
really early in the stages of

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.680 
really early in the stages of
development<00:06:00.160> which<00:06:00.370> it<00:06:00.520> obviously<00:06:00.670> is<00:06:01.120> but

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
development which it obviously is but

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:03.960 
development which it obviously is but
I'm<00:06:01.900> not<00:06:02.110> a<00:06:02.140> big<00:06:02.380> fan<00:06:02.410> of<00:06:02.650> the<00:06:02.980> big<00:06:03.160> merging<00:06:03.880> of

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
I'm not a big fan of the big merging of

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.910 
I'm not a big fan of the big merging of
interfaces<00:06:04.570> maybe<00:06:04.780> they'll<00:06:04.990> better

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:05.920 
interfaces maybe they'll better

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.860 
interfaces maybe they'll better
integrate<00:06:06.400> them<00:06:06.580> or<00:06:06.760> make<00:06:07.360> it<00:06:07.510> all<00:06:07.630> the<00:06:07.750> new

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:07.870 
integrate them or make it all the new

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:09.030 
integrate them or make it all the new
one<00:06:08.050> which<00:06:08.230> would<00:06:08.350> be<00:06:08.470> interesting<00:06:08.890> but

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:09.040 
one which would be interesting but

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.890 
one which would be interesting but
Windows<00:06:09.850> 8<00:06:09.970> is<00:06:10.000> definitely<00:06:10.570> going<00:06:10.690> to<00:06:10.750> be<00:06:10.870> a

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900 
Windows 8 is definitely going to be a

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.660
