00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.920 
have the same situation so many times
that<00:02:48.560> term<00:02:49.010> has<00:02:49.160> been<00:02:49.370> shipped<00:02:49.700> off<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.360> i'm

able<00:03:04.910> to<00:03:05.390> record<00:03:06.320> it<00:03:06.590> but<00:03:06.860> the<00:03:07.010> stupid<00:03:07.310> camera

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
able to record it but the stupid camera

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.570

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
messed up the footage so i wasn't able

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:16.120 
messed up the footage so i wasn't able
to<00:03:11.450> show<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:12.160> exactly<00:03:13.900> the<00:03:14.900> results<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.530> this

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
to show you exactly the results and this

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:22.350 
to show you exactly the results and this
is<00:03:16.370> from<00:03:16.610> a<00:03:16.640> week<00:03:17.030> old<00:03:17.500> flat<00:03:18.500> iron<00:03:19.090> so<00:03:20.380> yeah

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
is from a week old flat iron so yeah

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.140 
is from a week old flat iron so yeah
it's<00:03:23.360> about<00:03:23.450> time<00:03:23.900> to<00:03:24.110> cut<00:03:24.290> those<00:03:24.500> hands

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
it's about time to cut those hands

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.610 
it's about time to cut those hands
because<00:03:26.150> i<00:03:26.330> can't<00:03:26.630> even<00:03:26.780> get<00:03:27.080> a<00:03:27.110> comb<00:03:27.590> through

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620

because i can't even get a comb through
my<00:03:28.040> head
