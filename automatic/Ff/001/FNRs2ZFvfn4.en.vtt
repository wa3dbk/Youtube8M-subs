person have a pistol try not use the
Magnum<00:01:26.659> looks<00:01:26.810> I<00:01:26.900> think<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:27.140> Magnum<00:01:27.470> will

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
Magnum looks I think the Magnum will

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.080 
Magnum looks I think the Magnum will
probably<00:01:27.950> kill<00:01:28.190> if<00:01:28.340> you<00:01:28.430> use<00:01:28.550> a<00:01:28.580> sniper<00:01:28.910> in<00:01:29.060> a

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
probably kill if you use a sniper in a

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.660
