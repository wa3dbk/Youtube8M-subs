00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.850 
years ago it was not just scale was
actually<00:00:45.030> did<00:00:45.210> basic<00:00:45.600> square<00:00:45.960> everything<00:00:46.800> I

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
actually did basic square everything I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.590 
actually did basic square everything I
should<00:00:47.010> say<00:00:47.219> it<00:00:48.000> was<00:00:48.059> look<00:00:48.210> at<00:00:48.300> looking<00:00:48.510> at

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
should say it was look at looking at

and of course you got the set button

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
and of course you got the set button
into<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:14.970> cores<00:02:15.239> like<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.629> life<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.650> what<00:02:16.860> -

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
into the cores like that life is what -

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.910 
into the cores like that life is what -
it<00:02:18.750> makes<00:02:18.900> the<00:02:18.989> humming<00:02:19.230> sound<00:02:19.260> because<00:02:19.709> it's

it makes the humming sound because it's
actually<00:02:20.160> rotating<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.120> design<00:02:21.450> back<00:02:21.660> there

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
actually rotating the design back there

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.260 
actually rotating the design back there
there's<00:02:22.080> actually

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:23.270 
there's actually

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.600
