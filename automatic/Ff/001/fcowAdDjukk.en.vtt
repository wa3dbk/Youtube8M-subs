I<00:01:40.200> would<00:01:40.619> give<00:01:40.799> -<00:01:41.040> because<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.490> think<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.210> drunk

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
I would give - because I think the drunk

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.359 
I would give - because I think the drunk
would<00:01:42.840> definitely<00:01:43.229> increase<00:01:43.530> its<00:01:43.710> value<00:01:44.070> to

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
would definitely increase its value to

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.880 
would definitely increase its value to
me<00:01:44.490> but<00:01:45.110> even<00:01:46.110> then<00:01:46.229> it's<00:01:46.380> just<00:01:46.470> desperation

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
me but even then it's just desperation

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.590 
me but even then it's just desperation
drunk<00:01:47.340> so<00:01:47.490> probably<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:47.880> low<00:01:48.030> low<00:01:48.360> tier

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
drunk so probably like a low low tier

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.160 
drunk so probably like a low low tier
that'd<00:01:49.049> be<00:01:49.200> a<00:01:49.229> mix<00:01:49.860> like<00:01:50.600> it<00:01:51.600> sounded<00:01:51.990> good<00:01:52.110> on
