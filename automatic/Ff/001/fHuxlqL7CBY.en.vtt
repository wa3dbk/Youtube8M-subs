00:00:57.479 --> 00:01:02.609
 july welcome to one 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:06.700
 Another little I would say 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:11.020
 tutorial or whatever I have 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.360
 yesterday at sbo phoenix's on the moon 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.340
 shoots part as seen and he has 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.390
 said it could still be optimized 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:22.200
 with automatic refilling gabler and 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.970
 I once ordered this rocket to the moon 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.940
 is just the outer one is just 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.280
 decoration and yes I have just 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:33.280
 already seen how it all works 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.619
 and I'll show you just continue to 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.869
 presses the button is here 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:43.959
 teleported is already in there so one 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:47.470
 press the button tnt falls down 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:51.459
 I do not have in games just one 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:55.509
 flies up and is not practicing 

00:01:51.459 --> 00:02:00.250
 year old comes if you so why me 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.899
 no sounds i just do not have any 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.800
 Woman does not matter 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.429
 make file tones and yes if you 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.120
 you just want to suppress that 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:15.910
 If you put yourself down here presses down 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.099
 and lands exactly in this pool 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:27.040
 I can also show you briefly once 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:28.959
 that works too well because of me 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.739
 On facebook you get so from tnt no 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.470
 damage 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.840
 and you can make good use of it 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.159
 push it because you get half a 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.050
 year damage when you note the pension 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:42.819
 will turn upside down but it will work 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.290
 not 100 percent so that can be 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.480
 I do but it worked so and 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.700
 You see I have half a year 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.060
 taken harm or so and now if 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.600
 I want to pay attention to that 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.920
 one stands with me approximately the way I became 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.120
 just a bit to the right 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.730
 so yes 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.110
 did it and without a game 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.659
 fashion and without harm 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.610
 I think that's pretty cool, too 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.140
 Just show it and I show it 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:17.030
 let's have a look at the technology 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:21.290
 behind it so what does the button 4 short 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:25.159
 in the games so down here the redstone 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:29.180
 gc 2 because first we go to the 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:30.140
 main part here and how you see is one 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.459
 Something has gone wrong 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:34.700
 is a little something exploding 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:38.470
 but go fortunately the combat blogs 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.609
 not broken which is pretty cool yes 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.060
 I'm not there a 

00:03:40.609 --> 00:03:47.030
 so bite over there you see i can do that 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:52.069
 not now or I can but the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.829
 Can I get away so and so in the 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.989
 comics has a block command 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:02.420
 stores the tnt again and again 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.620
 automatically after the team is stopped 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:05.269
 then always there when you hit the button 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.269
 So, for example, I can say 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:13.400
 good to show 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:15.470
 come here yes there is nothing here 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.940
 also down here in the middle and 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.829
 made at high fence then you fly 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.769
 you really need higher 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.990
 not because I have so already 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.190
 had problems on the perfect 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:27.320
 platform to land without shadow 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:32.810
 but I have that good too 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:35.110
 when I get to myself then so 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.940
 we are expanding our target price again 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.550
 where does the other side lead the other 

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:44.030
 page causes that at the top 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.419
 platform I wait times short fly high 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.490
 Sun peek whether now it works 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:54.199
 There is little chance of that happening 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:56.810
 hole missed above yes works because 

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:59.270
 here are the blocks under 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:04.280
 One made that way and one down 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:06.470
 on the button presses in the moment if one 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.250
 are pressing on the button the whole 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.919
 blocks again 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:11.450
 So would be exchanged with air 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.770
 that they are gone again 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.169
 You do not always have to do that automatically 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.080
 from 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:23.509
 so then we do it all right 

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:29.349
 again to no I need schlepps so 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:33.889
 so so where I just raps me dirk 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:35.900
 kappes labs on it sees everything again 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:39.229
 Great out of here is little water hole 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:42.590
 actually does not bother what 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:46.490
 shall i say yes above as i do that 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.229
 have done with the vingster so now 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:51.349
 but you may not see it now 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:55.099
 always works yet 

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:58.639
 Good luck as you see I have 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:01.219
 up here the kickin made and the 

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:04.870
 Trips trigger more combox from the exact 

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:06.860
 down the hole again full with the gate 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.680
 you know now also from the 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.169
 previous tutorial already like that 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:13.789
 works with the set blog blog then 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:15.310
 the coordinate then the idea of ​​that 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.960
 blog below zero 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.399
 that's the direction of knowledge that's good 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.250
 if you want to get used to it 

00:06:19.399 --> 00:06:24.680
 what you do not know for example 1 234 then 

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:27.050
 the different heavenly directions yes 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:28.159
 and this is very easy has get 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.580
 everyone in that just a little 

00:06:28.159 --> 00:06:33.229
 torched the place that provides here 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.419
 then he goes on it 

00:06:33.229 --> 00:06:37.550
 very briefly and if so yes yes and then 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:38.719
 so everything stood and it fits 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.099
 should be a one hundred percent chance 

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:41.719
 if you do not move a bit 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:46.699
 Do you have the obstacle if I hate 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:48.860
 you yes five minutes video yes fits 

00:06:46.699 --> 00:06:51.349
 actually, there is still interest 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:54.080
 previous year's post fits and I feel 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.669
 I am happy if you have the video positive 

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:58.310
 could be or maybe 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:59.990
 Share with others how much 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.490
 trouble I have given myself here because it 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.819
 I flew into the air twice 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:07.039
 knew how to rebuild it twice 

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:09.110
 it has now been how long I have it 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:11.149
 I've worked for 45 hours 

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:12.889
 I have no idea of ​​course 

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:14.300
 also make it easier with the spin 

00:07:12.889 --> 00:07:15.830
 or so, but that's kind of cool 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.520
 I like comment box 

00:07:15.830 --> 00:07:20.520
 as I said 

00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:23.610
 rate share of the regime has berberich 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.470
 yes already my mouth and then if I 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.919
 Have a nice day today 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:27.919
