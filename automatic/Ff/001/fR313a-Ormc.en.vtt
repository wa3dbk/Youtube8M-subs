so<00:00:27.960> they<00:00:28.080> had<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.199> five-day<00:00:28.740> training<00:00:29.039> session

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
so they had a five-day training session

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.150 
so they had a five-day training session
with<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.760> maze<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.449> then<00:00:30.679> they<00:00:31.679> had<00:00:31.859> them<00:00:32.040> on

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
with a maze and then they had them on

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.740 
with a maze and then they had them on
this<00:00:32.309> for<00:00:32.489> six<00:00:32.700> weeks<00:00:32.880> and<00:00:33.149> then<00:00:33.239> they<00:00:33.329> tested

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
this for six weeks and then they tested

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.630 
this for six weeks and then they tested
again<00:00:33.989> tested<00:00:34.680> them<00:00:34.800> again<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.100> just<00:00:35.130> just<00:00:35.520> so

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
again tested them again so just just so

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.970 
again tested them again so just just so
we're<00:00:35.790> clear<00:00:35.940> you've<00:00:36.180> got<00:00:36.360> three<00:00:36.899> test<00:00:37.620> groups

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
we're clear you've got three test groups

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.220 
we're clear you've got three test groups
of<00:00:38.250> rats<00:00:39.710> one<00:00:40.710> that's<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.520> control<00:00:42.230> nothing

except<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.100> training<00:00:44.579> right<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.000> they're

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
except the training right so they're

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.319 
except the training right so they're
given<00:00:45.510> a<00:00:45.660> normal<00:00:46.559> diet<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.070> plain<00:00:47.460> water<00:00:47.730> then

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
given a normal diet and plain water then

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.240 
given a normal diet and plain water then
you<00:00:48.510> have<00:00:48.719> your<00:00:49.140> first<00:00:49.320> experimental<00:00:49.920> group

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
you have your first experimental group

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.979 
you have your first experimental group
of<00:00:50.460> rats<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.789> get<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> exact<00:00:51.390> same<00:00:51.600> training

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
of rats you get the exact same training

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.220 
of rats you get the exact same training
program<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.559> instead<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.730> plain<00:00:54.719> water<00:00:54.960> they

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
program and instead of plain water they

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.680 
program and instead of plain water they
get<00:00:55.410> water<00:00:55.710> with<00:00:56.430> corn<00:00:56.969> syrup<00:00:57.239> then<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.539> have

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
get water with corn syrup then you have

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.840 
get water with corn syrup then you have
a<00:00:57.719> third<00:00:58.260> group<00:00:58.620> that<00:00:59.219> gets<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> same

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
a third group that gets the same

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.520 
a third group that gets the same
training<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.590> water<00:01:01.590> with<00:01:01.920> corn<00:01:02.370> syrup<00:01:02.730> and

to big business and the result is that

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
people to eat as corn so what happens

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.099 
people to eat as corn so what happens
well<00:04:02.950> let's<00:04:03.879> see<00:04:04.030> how<00:04:04.180> we<00:04:04.359> can't<00:04:04.599> grow<00:04:04.840> anymore

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:05.109 
well let's see how we can't grow anymore

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:07.770 
well let's see how we can't grow anymore
corn<00:04:05.709> that<00:04:06.040> people<00:04:06.370> can<00:04:06.519> actually<00:04:06.700> eat<00:04:07.209> but<00:04:07.629> we

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
corn that people can actually eat but we

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.629 
corn that people can actually eat but we
can<00:04:07.959> still<00:04:08.230> get<00:04:08.410> subsidized<00:04:09.040> for<00:04:09.280> it<00:04:09.340> so<00:04:09.459> we're

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:09.639 
can still get subsidized for it so we're

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.250 
can still get subsidized for it so we're
going<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.849> grow<00:04:10.030> corn<00:04:10.389> that<00:04:10.599> we<00:04:10.690> can<00:04:10.870> turn<00:04:11.079> into

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260
