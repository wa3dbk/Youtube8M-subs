00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.190
 Reason for the restrained start of both teams 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:06.819
 It took 20 minutes more University Bonn Braunschweig recovered 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:09.629
 Center Forward came to the first opportunity 

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:14.219
 55 days after his surgery, the first game was a good match 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:18.199
 after half an hour Braunschweig with Vorstopper Bruhns 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.300
 Thilo Pahl had the preference over 3 received 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.749
 and bugs RVV 

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:28.679
 then stretched leg of Rossmann free kick through the attentive 

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.679
 Referee Udo Voigt 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.679
 Rummenigge risked the known died early 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.600
 once again 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.900
 and then sand becomes too colorful 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.900
 the yellow card 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.500
 Michael Geiger 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:49.650
 or the worm 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.990
 one to zero for Eintracht Braunschweig 33 minutes of play 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.390
 the repetition shows 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:02.920
 the rummenigge is fast I would almost say undisciplined 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.720
 Run out the wall opens 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.050
 and the ball unsustainable for rides butcher 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:11.420
 30 thousand spectators say Haug Stadium 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.610
 Bayern usually only dangerous if Kalle celebrates 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.610
 attached to one of his flank runs 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.850
 Jan Franke with a lot of effort 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.480
 to the break 1 to 0 in a hitherto quite carefully led encounter 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.330
 second half both teams unchanged he also plays interestingly better 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.740
 Wolfgang Dremmler one of the three former Brunswicks 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.670
 Calle del Haye 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.250
 considered and bars 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.250
 and Breitner with a good degree 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.500
 Braunschweig's defense for Libero would be strong between the 55 and 77 minutes 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 inevitably, uncertainties crept up 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.100
 Breitner who now put in a lot of power 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:04.790
 Franke with a fist 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.790
 then drive your eyes 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.719
 again Klaus Augenthaler of the offensive Munich Libro 

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:17.109
 Rossmann in the interplay Rummenigge 

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:20.869
 prompt opera Rummenigges constant shadow narrowed the circles of the 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:23.819
 Wednesday still so successful national team captain considerably 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:26.819
 Only rarely could Rummenigge's son prevail 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:33.989
 thanks to a precise pass on Breitner you're not in the offside but out 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:38.989
 The compensation earned at that time did not fall to coach Jamal 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.819
 brought night clothes for Kraus 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.749
 Here is his long ball on Dieter HÃ¶hn 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.449
 Overall, APA barely came into its own 

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:50.489
 and Paul Breitner was almost sorry to suffer 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.489
 none of his successful actions where you rewarded with a goal 

00:02:54.999 --> 00:02:58.219
 Braunschweig Bundesliga is again thanks in the last 20 minutes 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:02:59.930
 liberate enormous fighting power 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.290
 Franz Nopper drove forward with junior players and players again and again 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.709
 little later free kick 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.519
 Reiner Hollmann 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.519
 and threw a spectacular 

00:03:17.899 --> 00:03:19.589
 then the decision 

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:20.889
 lives 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.309
 a long pass on the Baarer 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:25.879
 the mountain header winner against Augenthaler 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.879
 and pay attention to the sample if necessary with the hand to the ball 

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:33.239
 once again from the point of view of the opulent us 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.149
 Beba was careful about rough 

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.919
 now a clear hand game 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:41.869
 generous generous the gift to the team 

00:03:41.869 --> 00:03:44.969
 for which he had played for a long time 

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:47.809
 Rheinaue man 

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:49.119
 calmly 

00:03:49.119 --> 00:03:50.269
 in the last week 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:51.319
 parried couple 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:53.589
 4 4 another penalty by Falkes 

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:57.689
 but this time untenable 2 to 0 82 minutes 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:01.289
 Bayern Munich defeated the cup defender at the latest now 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:03.150
 the Brunswick players cheered 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.499
 understandably it was the first home victory in this
