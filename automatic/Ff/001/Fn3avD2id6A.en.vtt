it's<00:00:10.469> different<00:00:10.769> views<00:00:10.950> we<00:00:11.099> still<00:00:11.280> get<00:00:11.400> a<00:00:11.460> nice

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
it's different views we still get a nice

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.249 
it's different views we still get a nice
idea<00:00:12.000> of<00:00:12.090> how<00:00:12.210> close<00:00:12.540> elapsed<00:00:12.809> really<00:00:13.110> were

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
idea of how close elapsed really were

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.810 
idea of how close elapsed really were
about<00:00:13.799> two<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.130> half<00:00:14.160> ten<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.580> end<00:00:14.730> of

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
about two and a half ten to the end of

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.160 
about two and a half ten to the end of
it<00:00:14.910> but<00:00:15.059> let's<00:00:15.120> play<00:00:15.330> it<00:00:15.420> now<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.780> see<00:00:16.020> how<00:00:16.109> we

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
it but let's play it now and see how we

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.170 
it but let's play it now and see how we
get<00:00:16.320> on<00:00:16.379> so<00:00:17.220> I'm<00:00:17.430> designing<00:00:17.550> here<00:00:17.940> is<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.090> be

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
get on so I'm designing here is to be

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.670 
get on so I'm designing here is to be
perfectly<00:00:18.570> synced<00:00:18.869> as<00:00:19.020> we<00:00:19.140> cross<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.410> line<00:00:19.529> so

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
perfectly synced as we cross the line so

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.720 
perfectly synced as we cross the line so
they<00:00:19.770> might<00:00:19.859> never<00:00:20.039> see<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.430> Shepherd

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
they might never see just Shepherd

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.490 
they might never see just Shepherd
Saracen<00:00:21.210> they're<00:00:21.330> nicely<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:22.230> just<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
Saracen they're nicely you just the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.340 
Saracen they're nicely you just the
audio<00:00:23.119> almost<00:00:24.119> exactly<00:00:24.660> in<00:00:24.720> six<00:00:25.019> we've<00:00:25.199> got

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
audio almost exactly in six we've got

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.839 
audio almost exactly in six we've got
mice<00:00:25.500> identical<00:00:26.070> runs<00:00:26.250> out<00:00:26.340> the<00:00:26.430> final<00:00:26.670> corner

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
mice identical runs out the final corner

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.609 
mice identical runs out the final corner
so<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.119> dead-on<00:00:27.359> even<00:00:27.720> at<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:27.840> moment<00:00:28.109> show<00:00:28.529> up

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
so it dead-on even at the moment show up

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.169 
so it dead-on even at the moment show up
in<00:00:28.710> to<00:00:28.800> revel<00:00:28.980> it<00:00:29.070> alone<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:29.250> both<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.580> us<00:00:29.670> go

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
in to revel it alone for both of us go

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.460 
in to revel it alone for both of us go
into<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.449> first<00:00:30.630> corner<00:00:30.869> now<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.050> breaking

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
into the first corner now and breaking

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.380 
into the first corner now and breaking
bang<00:00:32.130> on<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> curb<00:00:32.550> left-hand<00:00:32.969> side<00:00:33.149> there

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
bang on the curb left-hand side there

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.080 
bang on the curb left-hand side there
there<00:00:33.630> we<00:00:33.719> go<00:00:34.219> as<00:00:35.219> you<00:00:35.340> had<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.640> urge<00:00:35.730> brakes

there we go as you had that urge brakes

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.030 
there we go as you had that urge brakes
lightly<00:00:36.420> or<00:00:36.690> did<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> gears<00:00:37.590> slightly<00:00:37.770> faster

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
lightly or did the gears slightly faster

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.200 
lightly or did the gears slightly faster
than<00:00:38.190> Mesa<00:00:38.430> quite<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.760> first<00:00:38.910> bit<00:00:39.059> quicker

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
than Mesa quite not to first bit quicker

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.400 
than Mesa quite not to first bit quicker
as<00:00:39.329> we<00:00:39.390> go<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.570> the<00:00:39.690> right<00:00:39.840> now<00:00:39.960> I'm<00:00:40.050> slightly

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
as we go to the right now I'm slightly

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.080 
as we go to the right now I'm slightly
ahead<00:00:40.590> already<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.160> just<00:00:41.370> sitting<00:00:41.790> game<00:00:41.910> picks

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
ahead already so just sitting game picks

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.090 
ahead already so just sitting game picks
briefly<00:00:42.690> for<00:00:42.989> only<00:00:43.230> chat<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> believe<00:00:43.950> got

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
briefly for only chat and I believe got

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.440 
briefly for only chat and I believe got
a<00:00:44.129> better<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.399> a<00:00:44.430> corner<00:00:44.789> as<00:00:44.940> well<00:00:44.969> just<00:00:45.329> his

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
a better on a corner as well just his

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.750 
a better on a corner as well just his
game<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.719> now<00:00:45.890> yeah<00:00:46.890> ever<00:00:47.160> so<00:00:47.370> slightly<00:00:47.610> ahead

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
game is now yeah ever so slightly ahead

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.000 
game is now yeah ever so slightly ahead
so<00:00:48.059> I'm<00:00:48.390> breaking<00:00:48.750> flex<00:00:48.930> corner<00:00:49.170> then<00:00:49.260> once

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
so I'm breaking flex corner then once

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.950 
so I'm breaking flex corner then once
again<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.460> think<00:00:50.579> only<00:00:51.000> shifted<00:00:51.539> down<00:00:51.660> slightly

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
again I think only shifted down slightly

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.689 
again I think only shifted down slightly
quicker<00:00:52.140> my<00:00:52.350> gut<00:00:52.500> or<00:00:52.829> slightly<00:00:53.129> earlier<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.670> i

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
quicker my gut or slightly earlier so i

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.010 
quicker my gut or slightly earlier so i
think<00:00:53.879> i<00:00:54.000> might<00:00:54.120> even<00:00:54.180> more<00:00:54.539> ahead<00:00:54.660> now<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:54.870> get

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
think i might even more ahead now so get

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.540 
think i might even more ahead now so get
soma<00:00:55.289> once<00:00:55.500> again<00:00:55.949> as<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.219> cross<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.520> line

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
soma once again as you cross the line

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.610 
soma once again as you cross the line
neat<00:00:57.420> look<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> girl<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:57.960> left<00:00:58.109> there<00:00:58.260> i<00:00:58.289> am<00:00:58.590> a

neat look the girl and left there i am a
little<00:00:58.829> bit<00:00:59.010> ahead<00:00:59.100> not<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.489> lot<00:00:59.670> 20<00:00:59.910> 10<00:01:00.210> /

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
little bit ahead not a lot 20 10 /

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.060 
little bit ahead not a lot 20 10 /
habits<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> game<00:01:01.260> it's<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:01.949> for

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
habits going to the game it's going for

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.100 
habits going to the game it's going for
these<00:01:02.160> fast<00:01:02.430> corners<00:01:02.760> now<00:01:02.879> then<00:01:03.059> look<00:01:03.690> pretty

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
these fast corners now then look pretty

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.500 
these fast corners now then look pretty
even<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.559> me<00:01:04.710> nothing<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.400> seen<00:01:06.000> between<00:01:06.180> us

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
even to me nothing to be seen between us

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.120 
even to me nothing to be seen between us
to<00:01:06.720> breaking<00:01:07.049> out<00:01:07.140> down<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.530> next<00:01:07.799> tight

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
to breaking out down to this next tight

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.320 
to breaking out down to this next tight
corners<00:01:08.490> only<00:01:08.729> two<00:01:08.790> actually<00:01:09.000> reaches<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
corners only two actually reaches the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.850 
corners only two actually reaches the
apex<00:01:09.600> ever<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.020> slightly<00:01:10.260> before<00:01:10.439> me<00:01:10.680> but<00:01:10.799> I

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
apex ever so slightly before me but I

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.899 
apex ever so slightly before me but I
should<00:01:11.100> get<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.220> better<00:01:11.310> exit<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.700> recover

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
should get a better exit and recover

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.760 
should get a better exit and recover
that<00:01:12.030> back<00:01:12.240> so<00:01:12.479> already<00:01:13.200> back<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.439> me<00:01:13.500> visitors

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
that back so already back to me visitors

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.780
