side of the program this is the first
time<00:00:33.190> we've<00:00:33.370> had<00:00:33.460> a<00:00:33.520> decent<00:00:33.790> building<00:00:34.329> that's

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
time we've had a decent building that's

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.750 
time we've had a decent building that's
really<00:00:35.050> great<00:00:35.260> so<00:00:35.950> we've<00:00:36.130> now<00:00:36.250> got<00:00:36.309> space

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
really great so we've now got space

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.510 
really great so we've now got space
which<00:00:37.030> is<00:00:37.210> really<00:00:37.239> good<00:00:37.660> and<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:39.160> that<00:00:39.340> makes

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:39.520 
which is really good and and that makes

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.900 
which is really good and and that makes
life<00:00:39.730> a<00:00:39.820> lot<00:00:39.940> easier<00:00:40.000> on<00:00:40.480> everybody<00:00:40.890> we're

chassis and then towards the front

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.450 
chassis and then towards the front
you've<00:01:28.659> got<00:01:28.870> the<00:01:29.049> Cosworth<00:01:29.409> poly<00:01:29.890> one<00:01:30.040> engine

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
you've got the Cosworth poly one engine

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.130 
you've got the Cosworth poly one engine
and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
and

to<00:01:34.440> the<00:01:34.470> Cosworth<00:01:34.740> engine<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.910> then<00:01:36.150> the

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:36.510 
to the Cosworth engine and then the

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.150 
to the Cosworth engine and then the
monocoque<00:01:37.200> which<00:01:37.410> is<00:01:37.590> where<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.980> driver

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:38.160 
monocoque which is where the driver

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.980 
monocoque which is where the driver
under<00:01:38.610> Queen<00:01:38.940> is<00:01:39.240> actually<00:01:39.600> going<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.840> sit

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
under Queen is actually going to sit

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.290 
under Queen is actually going to sit
we've<00:01:40.740> got<00:01:40.950> some<00:01:41.220> some<00:01:41.610> more<00:01:41.760> testing<00:01:42.120> to<00:01:42.150> do

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
we've got some some more testing to do

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.390 
we've got some some more testing to do
down<00:01:42.510> in<00:01:42.660> Newquay<00:01:43.080> the<00:01:43.770> testing<00:01:44.130> there<00:01:44.280> will

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
down in Newquay the testing there will

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.340 
down in Newquay the testing there will
actually<00:01:44.490> be<00:01:44.700> with<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.330> rocket<00:01:45.660> pump<00:01:45.900> and

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
actually be with the rocket pump and

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.380 
actually be with the rocket pump and
then<00:01:46.800> we<00:01:46.950> can<00:01:47.130> see<00:01:47.310> how<00:01:47.490> it'll<00:01:47.670> work<00:01:47.820> with

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
then we can see how it'll work with

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.300 
then we can see how it'll work with
