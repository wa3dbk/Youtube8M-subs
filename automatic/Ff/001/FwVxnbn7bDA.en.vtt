00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.339
 Hello, friends, how are you going to prepare a 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.559
 spaghetti dish praising him with 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.900
 tomatoes this recipe will be for two 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.990
 people and we're going to need a 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.810
 Wheat spaghetti barqueta y 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:20.419
 cherry tomato choose two cloves of garlic 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.079
 and clams let's start by putting the 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:26.980
 water to boil in a pot and we put a 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:26.980
 good salt record 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:34.010
 then we are going to prepare the 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.050
 almonds the clams if you look at the 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.180
 we have in water and we have put them 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.220
 little bit of salt this is a trick that we 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.140
 helps the clams to be expelled all 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:43.790
 the sand there is also another trick that is 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.970
 put a little bit of sugar or even a 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:51.540
 little water to remove the water gas 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.060
 and I put them here in the pan if not 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.460
 let's add anything of liquid not the 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.720
 let's meet steam and warm up 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.460
 raising the pan and cover and when 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.140
 begin to detach the steam we are going 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.960
 to move to help them open 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.550
 and then we're going to use the juice of 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.960
 the clams for the sauce of the 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.530
 packages 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.659
 Now let's chop 2 cloves of garlic 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.530
 we give 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.689
 let's apply the garlic we give it a hit 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.359
 with the blade of the knife and so we will 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.329
 make it easier to chop it finer 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:31.259
 As you know we are on the eve of San 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:34.319
 valentine and this recipe sure for 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.560
 eating it with your partner with your friend goes to 

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:42.230
 be a delight for both of us let's see 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:44.920
 the clams already have the clam ready 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.320
 and what I'm going to do is discover it 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.860
 to avoid that nothing stall 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:54.140
 of sand or husk and we reserve 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:57.140
 the almonds here a little while in the 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.810
 same pan now let's prepare the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:03.520
 garlic with the serving tomato we put a 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:06.260
 trickle of oil like three tablespoons 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.530
 while it warms up we're going to 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:11.800
 prepare the cherry tomatoes that what 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.870
 I'm going to do is cut it in half 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.530
 previously when washed and for two 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.830
 people 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:22.880
 the amount would be another eight 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:25.790
 tomatoes we collect we hope that it 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.740
 heat the oil a little bit and 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.870
 first thing I do is add the garlic 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:33.160
 always the first thing for us to perfume 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.160
 olive oil 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:39.420
 when it starts to brown the garlic 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.280
 it will be time to put the tomato 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.080
 chef if we do not have cherry tomatoes 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.470
 also what we can use is a 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.150
 ripe tomato and we can even 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.850
 climb in boiling water to peel it 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.770
 the water for the pasta was already beginning to 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:57.650
 say two minutes and we'll have it 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.650
 list we add the cherry tomatoes 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.080
 I take the opportunity to put the well you are 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.920
 here the instructions already see us 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.920
 put two minutes 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:16.540
 the spaghetti move a little bit to 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:16.540
 let us loose well 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.570
 and in two minutes we will have our 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.090
 pasta ready good while it's going 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.060
 baking the pasta we already have the tomatoes 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.820
 to point and what we are going to do is add 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.220
 the broth that we have from cooking 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:34.130
 the clams and let it reduce a 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:36.380
 little the pasta and we have ready the 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.510
 let's drain 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.730
 and we have it drained I left a 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.950
 little of the cooking water that we 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.950
 will help for the sauce 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.200
 we add the pasta 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.850
 i 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:57.370
 and we're going to put a little parsley 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.370
 chopped and we'll have it almost ready 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.860
 i 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.440
 let's mix well 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.890
 we add a little pepper 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:17.040
 and now we have our pasta ready 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:18.930
 plant the pasta quickly as it does not 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:23.090
 interesting to let her rest because this is 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.090
 once done he has to eat 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:30.460
 and now finally 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.460
 we put the souls 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:38.350
 you see what more complete dish and more 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:41.230
 rich 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.320
 and as a final touch we're going to put a 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.650
 rosemary twig 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.510
 and a splash of safe olive oil 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:50.250
 that you will like and remember that a 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.430
 liking with life is celebrating with the 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.430
 yours 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:00.220
 and so much 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.340
 or not
