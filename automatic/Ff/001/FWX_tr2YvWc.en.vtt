00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
fast before much color machine but I

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.340 
fast before much color machine but I
said<00:02:13.100> it<00:02:13.220> scared<00:02:13.520> me<00:02:13.730> on<00:02:13.850> it<00:02:14.000> is<00:02:14.180> amazing<00:02:14.990> it's

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
said it scared me on it is amazing it's

got<00:02:15.470> a<00:02:15.500> high<00:02:15.650> quality<00:02:15.950> scan<00:02:16.340> or<00:02:16.520> they<00:02:16.670> could

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
got a high quality scan or they could

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.330 
got a high quality scan or they could
buy<00:02:17.570> the<00:02:17.630> scanner<00:02:18.110> alone<00:02:18.590> that's<00:02:18.890> what<00:02:19.100> money

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
buy the scanner alone that's what money

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.120 
buy the scanner alone that's what money
so<00:02:20.030> as<00:02:20.600> you<00:02:20.690> see<00:02:20.930> it's<00:02:20.990> got<00:02:21.170> a<00:02:21.230> sparse<00:02:21.530> index<00:02:21.740> or

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130 
so as you see it's got a sparse index or

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.520 
so as you see it's got a sparse index or
so<00:02:22.670> there's<00:02:23.210> that<00:02:23.480> reduce<00:02:23.810> its<00:02:24.080> producing

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
so there's that reduce its producing

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.070 
so there's that reduce its producing
fast<00:02:24.830> and<00:02:25.190> now<00:02:25.340> the<00:02:25.970> artillery<00:02:26.540> set<00:02:26.810> them<00:02:26.990> in

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
fast and now the artillery set them in
