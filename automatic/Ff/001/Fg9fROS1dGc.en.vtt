brand new ultra bike kit now this kit at
the<00:00:35.100> time<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:35.760> leading<00:00:36.420> technologies<00:00:37.110> with

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
the time was leading technologies with

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.200 
the time was leading technologies with
ryder<00:00:37.680> leds<00:00:38.219> then<00:00:38.489> we're<00:00:38.610> available<00:00:38.820> any

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
ryder leds then we're available any

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.780 
ryder leds then we're available any
place<00:00:39.420> else<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.530> had<00:00:40.680> our<00:00:40.710> unique<00:00:41.100> smart

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
place else and we had our unique smart

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.549 
place else and we had our unique smart
signal<00:00:42.149> technology<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:42.960> then<00:00:43.200> require

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
signal technology so that then require

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.979 
signal technology so that then require
rewired<00:00:44.270> so<00:00:45.270> I'm<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.660> move<00:00:45.870> the

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
rewired so I'm just going to move the

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.850 
rewired so I'm just going to move the
kit<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.879> guess<00:00:47.879> with<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.149> when<00:00:48.690> you<00:00:48.809> put<00:00:49.649> an

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
kit I guess with you when you put an

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.540 
kit I guess with you when you put an
Mustang<00:00:50.730> project<00:00:51.090> led<00:00:51.239> kit<00:00:51.719> in<00:00:51.989> your<00:00:52.430> 64<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.520> a

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
Mustang project led kit in your 64 and a

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.160 
Mustang project led kit in your 64 and a
half<00:00:53.699> through<00:00:53.940> 66<00:00:54.420> Mustang<00:00:54.780> it's<00:00:54.930> very

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
half through 66 Mustang it's very

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.160 
half through 66 Mustang it's very
important<00:00:55.649> before<00:00:56.100> you<00:00:56.430> insert<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.820> LED<00:00:57.570> base

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
important before you insert the LED base

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.920 
important before you insert the LED base
to<00:00:58.770> remove<00:00:59.070> this<00:00:59.280> boot<00:00:59.609> the<00:01:00.449> reason<00:01:00.719> you<00:01:00.780> want

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
to remove this boot the reason you want

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.990 
to remove this boot the reason you want
to<00:01:01.020> remove<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.440> boot<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.980> because<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
to remove this boot is because the

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.240 
to remove this boot is because the
spring<00:01:03.329> inside<00:01:03.870> here<00:01:04.260> will<00:01:04.439> often<00:01:04.769> get<00:01:04.890> quoted

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
spring inside here will often get quoted

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.240 
spring inside here will often get quoted
and<00:01:05.580> stuck<00:01:06.180> with<00:01:06.390> age<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.470> boot<00:01:07.680> kind<00:01:08.130> of

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
and stuck with age and the boot kind of

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.450 
and stuck with age and the boot kind of
makes<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.119> even<00:01:09.270> stick<00:01:09.689> here<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.290> put<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.100> LED

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
makes it even stick here so put the LED

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.090 
makes it even stick here so put the LED
base<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:12.000> put<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> module<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.200> adjust<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.950> and

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
base in put the module in adjust it and

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.920 
base in put the module in adjust it and
then<00:01:14.400> when<00:01:14.520> everything's<00:01:14.880> inserted<00:01:15.600> and<00:01:15.750> put

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
then when everything's inserted and put

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.620 
then when everything's inserted and put
in<00:01:16.080> put<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.710> boot<00:01:17.250> back<00:01:17.490> on<00:01:17.729> so<00:01:18.240> we'll<00:01:18.390> remove

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
in put the boot back on so we'll remove

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.630 
in put the boot back on so we'll remove
the<00:01:18.689> boot<00:01:18.930> for<00:01:19.110> now<00:01:19.259> we'll<00:01:20.040> put<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> LED

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
the boot for now we'll put the LED

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.120 
the boot for now we'll put the LED
module<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.360> put<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.659> boot<00:01:21.780> back<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.170> we

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
module in and put the boot back in we

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.160 
module in and put the boot back in we
have<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.430> new<00:01:23.549> kit<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.150> new<00:01:24.299> ultrabright<00:01:24.720> kit

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
have the new kit the new ultrabright kit

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.950 
have the new kit the new ultrabright kit
you<00:01:26.130> can<00:01:26.159> see<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.520> contrast<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.330> our<00:01:27.479> old

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
you can see the contrast in our old

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.030 
you can see the contrast in our old
production<00:01:28.530> 11<00:01:29.400> years<00:01:29.610> ago<00:01:29.670> versus<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> new

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 
production 11 years ago versus the new

production 11 years ago versus the new
11<00:01:32.040> years<00:01:32.189> ago<00:01:32.430> leds<00:01:33.060> were<00:01:33.270> very<00:01:33.479> expensive

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
11 years ago leds were very expensive

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.899 
11 years ago leds were very expensive
but<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.350> used<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.770> unique<00:01:35.100> LED<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:35.820> was

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
but we used a unique LED that was

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.490 
but we used a unique LED that was
brighter<00:01:36.270> than<00:01:36.509> anything<00:01:36.869> else<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.439> the

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
brighter than anything else on the

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.280 
brighter than anything else on the
market<00:01:37.759> now<00:01:38.759> we<00:01:38.820> use<00:01:39.119> those<00:01:39.299> same<00:01:39.509> unique<00:01:39.780> LEDs

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
market now we use those same unique LEDs

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:48.200 
market now we use those same unique LEDs
but<00:01:41.100> we<00:01:41.250> have<00:01:41.460> 90<00:01:42.360> LEDs<00:01:43.880> per<00:01:44.960> per<00:01:45.960> side<00:01:46.200> here<00:01:47.210> we

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
but we have 90 LEDs per per side here we

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.300 
but we have 90 LEDs per per side here we
use<00:01:48.240> service<00:01:48.630> about<00:01:48.810> technology<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:50.070> same

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
use service about technology the same

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.420 
use service about technology the same

smart signal patented control circuit as

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.330 
smart signal patented control circuit as
usual<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:53.970> you<00:01:54.030> don't<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:55.310> rewire<00:01:56.310> your

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
usual so you don't have to rewire your

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.060 
usual so you don't have to rewire your
car<00:01:56.790> so<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.719> just<00:01:57.869> insert<00:01:58.229> the<00:01:58.259> base<00:01:58.530> simple<00:01:58.979> as

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
car so we just insert the base simple as

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.219 
car so we just insert the base simple as
that<00:01:59.100> there's<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.000> standoff<00:02:00.479> already<00:02:00.930> chosen

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that there's a standoff already chosen

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.170
