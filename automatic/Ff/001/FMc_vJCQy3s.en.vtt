 Hey! Mattias at VEGO here. Merry Christmas! What is Christmas without herring? Absolutely great if you ask me, because I thought- 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.180
 - In fact, invite my family to two cruel vegas. 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.620
 One with lime and one with curry and apple. So, hang out! 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:30.500
 To this vegosill I use aubergine pieces that can boil lightly in water and it gets a little 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.640
 the same texture as herring. So test, I promise! 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.920
 What you start with is to scale them. You do that with a regular potato peeler. 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.980
 After you have peeled them, cut them into smaller pieces with a knife. Remember not to cut for small pieces 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.240
 -of the eggplant, because they decrease a little in size when they are simmering in water. 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.560
 So then they disappear completely. 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:05.400
 Vegosill is such a thing that you can fool the whole thick family with, because it is absolutely crazy how not to notice- 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.820
 - Any difference actually. 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.420
 Don't forget to salt the water first. You may be a little generous, fish is a little salt. 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.280
 And then down with the eggplant. And this may take one to two minutes, so don't cook too long. 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.380
 Then they become far too soft. 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:38.700
 Now the eggplant pieces are perfect. And then you pour off the water. 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:52.980
 And then you rinse them in cold water so that boiling stops. Otherwise, they will be far too soft. 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.560
 Then rinse in cold water and when they are cold then try to squeeze out as much water 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.240
 -You can, without mashing them for that matter. 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.060
 And then they are ready to swim in some good sauces. 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:18.380
 For the lime sauce, the boiled eggplant you just made is needed. Then it needs a deciliter of natural yogurt. 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.660
 I use soy yoghurt. There. 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.560
 A deciliter of mayonnaise is needed. I use an egg-free mayonnaise. 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:38.040
 And then of course lime. And it must be shaved off a lime. It's just to tear right down. 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.060
 Remember to just take the utmost green for otherwise it can be a bit bitter. 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.640
 Divide the glue and squeeze it down. 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.680
 Make sure there are no cores in just that. 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.840
 And then we should season with some salt and black pepper. 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.940
 And then move together. 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.440
 And for the apple and curry sauce, eggplant is needed. 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.140
 An apple is needed, nicely chopped. Feel like an acid. 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.240
 Two deciliters of mayonnaise are needed. 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.740
 Mayonnaise does everything automatically. 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.060
 And then two deciliters of natural yogurt. 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.300
 Two teaspoons of curry. 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.520
 Salt and black pepper. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.140
 Then the same thing. It's just moving together. 

00:04:05.345 --> 00:04:07.345
 Feel like in a small bowl. 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.560
 The eggplant was completely crazy green today. It usually changes a little in color, it looks great fun. 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.100
 The important thing is that it tastes good. 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.780
 So there. Two absolutely wonderful vegosillar. One with curry and apple and one with lime. 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.760
 Promise me that you test this for the Christmas table. You will deceive every single one you have. 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.980
 And then in the middle days it is the perfect lay on the sandwich. It is crazy. 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:49.100
 You will find the recipes in the newspaper VEGO or on vegomagasinet.se. I wish you a merry christmas! Have a good one!
