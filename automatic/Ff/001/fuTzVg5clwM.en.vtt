00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 And about 4 gears, it's in principle. 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:12.179
 most cases there is a problem 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:14.370
 that breaks this tree and breaks the stock why 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:19.619
 so there is but for example here is good 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.779
 you can see the 4th gear adventure if 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.460
 for example, there is no gap here, but we have 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:29.670
 there is because we put up 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:35.600
 and if you do not have that rocker david with this 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.600
 hand on the plug she gets out 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.660
 gets out like this and lights this 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.649
 sword and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:46.200
 draw side squirrels this principle 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.670
 bass player if there is no gap 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.660
 here and also if for example the shaft is drowned 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.190
 forks 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:01.379
 if value arched does not look out because 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:04.439
 bit and splines very sastra here 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:08.180
 it turns out that the secondary shaft 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:13.560
 here we have it just falls right on 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:16.110
 procession here and if it's all with him 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.869
 if sump 2 is going to display 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.860
 we have that this gear just 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.920
 the secondary shaft is simply clamped 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.909
 suffocating invasion some already burns 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.650
 us a plug as it sits there 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.320
 cleans up and then you break it 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:37.170
 further and so further and so further so 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.009
 lest this happen on give us 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:43.710
 take her shaft just to the cinema step 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.799
 but if we threw the puck all is well 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.439
 a little bit here the slots came out and 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.549
 expanses the secondary shaft falls already on 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:57.270
 shaft primary shaft and here in this part not 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:02:00.090
 have shat freely we oblo finds 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.340
 a little bit like that 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.659
 but it is necessary to collect naturally without 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.950
 kalenval where is the lid then see well 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.780
 and they are joined if not 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.400
 Well because you can match the washer 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.959
 cram that principle crankcase not 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.819
 will converge here if we all put it together we 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.700
 just go back and we start 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.450
 all first check whether everything is in place 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.569
 there 1 2 3 4 transmissions is not clamped 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.260
 the most important thing is not clamped where gears 

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:36.900
 here they have a straight cut right here and 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.989
 right here and if everything is good in principle 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.690
 that give up the chicken starting ending 1 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.500
 and 4 gears this principle everything should 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:49.319
 work fine basically on this all 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.410
 adjust and end the boxes 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:56.290
 there is nothing more there 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:03:01.049
 terrible but it happens all of course necessary 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.049
 deal with it as so that tasks are all
