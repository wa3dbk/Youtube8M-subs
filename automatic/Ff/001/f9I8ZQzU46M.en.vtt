00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
of a stretch for him to put them on if

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:48.380 
of a stretch for him to put them on if
you<00:04:46.140> didn't<00:04:46.650> see<00:04:46.890> his<00:04:47.070> hair<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.580> if<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.150> saw

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
you didn't see his hair and if you saw

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.020 
you didn't see his hair and if you saw
the<00:04:48.450> glasses<00:04:49.080> on<00:04:49.350> him<00:04:49.770> you<00:04:50.370> would<00:04:50.520> see<00:04:50.760> that

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.030 
the glasses on him you would see that

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.190 
the glasses on him you would see that
it's<00:04:51.600> not<00:04:51.870> sitting<00:04:52.710> comfortably<00:04:53.370> at<00:04:53.790> all

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
it's not sitting comfortably at all

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.640 
it's not sitting comfortably at all
right<00:04:55.200> here<00:04:55.470> on<00:04:55.560> the<00:04:55.710> sides<00:04:55.950> so<00:04:57.650> they're

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
right here on the sides so they're

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.470 
right here on the sides so they're
labeled<00:04:59.130> 1/3<00:04:59.490> but<00:04:59.730> I<00:04:59.760> would<00:04:59.970> stick<00:05:00.180> to<00:05:00.300> almost

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:00.480 
labeled 1/3 but I would stick to almost

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:04.210 
labeled 1/3 but I would stick to almost
just<00:05:01.380> your<00:05:01.620> MSD<00:05:02.400> sizes<00:05:02.910> for<00:05:03.210> these<00:05:03.630> glasses

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 
just your MSD sizes for these glasses

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:07.430 
just your MSD sizes for these glasses
and<00:05:05.220> also<00:05:05.760> another<00:05:05.970> thing<00:05:06.300> is<00:05:06.690> that<00:05:06.720> they<00:05:07.020> kind

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
and also another thing is that they kind

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.880 
and also another thing is that they kind
of<00:05:07.590> like<00:05:07.800> only<00:05:08.190> fit<00:05:08.730> to<00:05:08.880> this<00:05:09.560> sides<00:05:10.560> of<00:05:10.770> his

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:13.550 
of like only fit to this sides of his
face<00:05:11.070> and<00:05:11.340> I'm<00:05:12.180> not<00:05:12.330> like<00:05:12.480> a<00:05:12.570> glasses<00:05:13.080> expert

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
face and I'm not like a glasses expert

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:16.610 
face and I'm not like a glasses expert
but<00:05:13.890> I've<00:05:14.220> heard<00:05:14.940> that<00:05:15.570> when<00:05:15.840> you<00:05:15.960> get<00:05:16.080> glasses

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:16.620 
but I've heard that when you get glasses

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.230 
but I've heard that when you get glasses
it<00:05:16.740> needs<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:17.070> like<00:05:17.220> fit<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.760> sides<00:05:17.970> of<00:05:18.120> your

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.690 
it needs to like fit the sides of your
face<00:05:18.480> and<00:05:18.780> I<00:05:19.290> mean<00:05:19.440> this<00:05:19.590> is<00:05:19.710> kind<00:05:19.920> of<00:05:20.010> a<00:05:20.340> little

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
face and I mean this is kind of a little

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:24.950 
face and I mean this is kind of a little
bit<00:05:20.820> too<00:05:21.150> far<00:05:21.510> into<00:05:21.840> his<00:05:22.380> face<00:05:22.620> so<00:05:23.400> yeah<00:05:24.000> I

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
bit too far into his face so yeah I

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:27.140 
bit too far into his face so yeah I
wouldn't<00:05:25.470> necessarily<00:05:25.860> say<00:05:26.580> that<00:05:26.880> you<00:05:27.030> know

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
wouldn't necessarily say that you know

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.180 
wouldn't necessarily say that you know
even<00:05:27.930> though<00:05:28.080> they're<00:05:28.290> labeled<00:05:28.650> 1/3<00:05:29.010> that

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
even though they're labeled 1/3 that

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:31.310 
even though they're labeled 1/3 that
yeah<00:05:29.310> you<00:05:29.370> can<00:05:29.610> go<00:05:29.760> ahead<00:05:29.850> and<00:05:30.030> put<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.240> 1<00:05:30.360> s<00:05:30.990> DS

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
yeah you can go ahead and put the 1 s DS

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.190 
yeah you can go ahead and put the 1 s DS
because<00:05:31.680> it<00:05:31.890> just<00:05:32.040> it<00:05:32.580> doesn't<00:05:32.940> look<00:05:33.150> it<00:05:33.990> isn't

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
because it just it doesn't look it isn't

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.200 
because it just it doesn't look it isn't
look<00:05:34.410> great<00:05:34.680> so<00:05:34.920> just<00:05:35.130> to<00:05:35.190> do<00:05:35.310> comparison<00:05:35.970> on

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
look great so just to do comparison on

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:39.650 
look great so just to do comparison on
another<00:05:36.750> size<00:05:37.170> like<00:05:37.890> 1/3<00:05:38.400> size<00:05:38.880> glasses<00:05:39.570> that

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
another size like 1/3 size glasses that

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.360 
another size like 1/3 size glasses that
I<00:05:39.720> have<00:05:39.960> you<00:05:40.530> can<00:05:40.710> see<00:05:40.890> that<00:05:41.040> these<00:05:41.160> are

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.370 
I have you can see that these are

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:44.870 
I have you can see that these are
actually<00:05:41.540> smaller<00:05:42.540> than<00:05:42.990> these<00:05:43.650> up<00:05:43.920> here<00:05:44.190> so<00:05:44.850> I

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
actually smaller than these up here so I

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:46.460 
actually smaller than these up here so I
mean<00:05:45.030> that's<00:05:45.120> why<00:05:45.390> I<00:05:45.420> kind<00:05:45.840> of<00:05:45.960> said<00:05:46.170> that<00:05:46.200> like

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
mean that's why I kind of said that like

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.140 
mean that's why I kind of said that like
if<00:05:46.620> you're<00:05:46.710> gonna<00:05:46.800> do<00:05:47.010> 1/3<00:05:47.460> glasses<00:05:47.910> I<00:05:48.000> would

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
if you're gonna do 1/3 glasses I would

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.660 
if you're gonna do 1/3 glasses I would
probably<00:05:48.600> you<00:05:49.020> know<00:05:49.130> get<00:05:50.130> something<00:05:50.460> that<00:05:50.580> is

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
probably you know get something that is

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.190 
probably you know get something that is
really<00:05:50.970> designed<00:05:51.090> for<00:05:51.330> 1/3<00:05:51.780> like<00:05:51.960> bigger

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:52.200 
really designed for 1/3 like bigger

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.170 
really designed for 1/3 like bigger
