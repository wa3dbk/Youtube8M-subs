00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.419

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.399

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.640
 look 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.899
 we exchange some text messages 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.129
 that we always communicated to each other 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.460
 He got away with some friends that's why not 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.619
 I did not live it because usually 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.770
 we are together on Saturday the night of 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:08.770
 Sunday 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:21.210
 and I stayed a little longer with the guys and 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:27.240
 there is no problem to beat 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:29.490
 it's like separation with mom in a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.740
 normal relationship with everyone with everything 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.290
 what is owed and a present father let's say 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.790
 I have understood that there are terrorists 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.150
 next to the moms of angels a lot 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.150
 weather 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.420
 and I was there but I knew that they were 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.150
 doing all this work with the networks 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.300
 social networks and with the means to deal with 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.830
 help find strategies they were 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.890
 doing and that I was doing all 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.310
 the parts 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.280
 more formal let's say was doing 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.780
 Taxation Taxation with all 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.159
 police complaints 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:12.480
 and all that when 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:15.420
 when they gave me the news that you're 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.580
 talking about the prosecution are working on 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.660
 some clue do you have some information 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:30.660
 Nothing is nothing and if I had it either 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:34.590
 after concentrating on being able to accompany 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.959

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.910
 that I hope the desire for 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.750
 I hope they find the murderers because 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.610
 It's the only thing that's going to let you sleep 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.560
 gives me no solution but at least 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.629
 it's going to be a relief to make a law about 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.150
 everything so that it does not happen more so that 

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.450
 I ended up sending you frank intimando 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.450
 a hug 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.599
 and it's not going to be any solution but it's going to 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.150
 be a relief the pain of a father for 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:07.540
 that this is not going to happen 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:09.920
 something that we all think naturally 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.060
 we get with the father 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.459
 [Music] 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.860
 the father says that if there were clues there 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.319
 they are going to tell you and it's okay now 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.390
 he also says that there is nothing in fact 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:22.430
 the invested ones I am a discard nothing nothing 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.730
 discard the public market not 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.920
 discard the ceamse that the murderer is 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.530
 inside the chance and work in the ceamse 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.870
 do not rule out the kids of the 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.209
 corner neither to the jets nor to the 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.920
 cartoneros that swarm by the place and 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.560
 do not rule out the places call 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:42.709
 dump trucks or abandoned trucks and the 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:44.540
 settlement of sea ​​side 193 which is a 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.910
 place for me I think it's one of the most 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.480
 important where could be a 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.480
 concrete track 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.440
 I still clean if I get intimate 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.670
 I say to you 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.379
 It still seems like something not so easy 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.690
 get rid of a corpse then follow me 

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:07.870
 you say no and a half of a movie with 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.610
 maldonado told me yesterday is not only easy 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.799
 but it could have been these 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.360
 tremendous to say it in perfect because if 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:15.299
 not found in the bag with the corpse 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.030
 of angels on the conveyor belt 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:20.310
 today we are all losing for angels 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.590
 crisis we keep looking we would give 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:26.560
 because to see the corpse of candela was 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:29.169
 left a place to be found and of 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.050
 fact it was found that there are places there 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.110
 moments when the killer leaves the 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.100
 corpse corpse of maría soledad morals 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.630
 appears on the side a very 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.520
 Busy to the exit of San Fernando 

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:40.780
 of the catamarca valley was going to 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:43.660
 find 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.680
 to the point that the good and all that 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.240
 at the time and if I had wanted 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.090
 I would have had to see I would not have left 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:51.400
 the body of the famous ones of luque el 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.639
 cost of the banking cost but I want 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:56.169
 tell 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.849
 the question is the murderer or the murderers 

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:02.360
 when they leave the body and put it in the 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:04.879
 circuit is made to be discovered or 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.560
 so that it is never discovered or for 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:08.479
 divert attention also or to 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.340
 send attention that is also another 

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.770
 element since it is a person who is 

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.919
 understood in the matter said a rapist 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:18.680
 serial or a person with a background 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:21.289
 surely I activate the calls and 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.759
 they want it to be for a kind of track 

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:24.199
 false that is something absolutely 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.330
 premeditated 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:29.330
 for me it's awkward or it's something 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.169
 premeditated where was the 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.169
 premeditated murders
