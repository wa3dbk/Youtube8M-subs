okay<00:00:05.040> so<00:00:05.100> this<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.910> test<00:00:06.180> flight<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:07.880> my<00:00:08.880> new

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
okay so this is a test flight of my new

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.129 
okay so this is a test flight of my new
helicopter<00:00:10.469> parts<00:00:10.969> so<00:00:11.969> this<00:00:12.599> helicopter<00:00:12.900> has

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
helicopter parts so this helicopter has

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.010 
helicopter parts so this helicopter has
got<00:00:13.290> a<00:00:13.580> pen<00:00:14.580> Esther<00:00:14.820> on<00:00:14.880> our<00:00:15.089> tail<00:00:15.480> rotor<00:00:15.690> and

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
got a pen Esther on our tail rotor and

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.880 
got a pen Esther on our tail rotor and
main<00:00:16.740> rotor<00:00:17.270> they<00:00:18.270> shoot<00:00:18.900> only<00:00:19.380> working

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
main rotor they shoot only working

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.460 
main rotor they shoot only working
nicely<00:00:20.160> now<00:00:20.520> had<00:00:21.210> some<00:00:21.480> problems<00:00:21.810> but<00:00:21.990> I've

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
nicely now had some problems but I've

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.820 
nicely now had some problems but I've
got<00:00:22.769> no<00:00:24.590> off<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:26.310> go

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.130 

this<00:00:30.930> tail<00:00:31.930> rotor<00:00:32.169> is<00:00:32.890> actually<00:00:33.550> a<00:00:34.140> two-way

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
this tail rotor is actually a two-way

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.690 
this tail rotor is actually a two-way
RCS<00:00:35.770> thrusters<00:00:36.430> so<00:00:36.700> you<00:00:36.760> can<00:00:37.030> see<00:00:37.380> us<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:39.430> the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:39.700 
RCS thrusters so you can see us do the

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.370 
RCS thrusters so you can see us do the
oil

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:41.380

thrusting<00:00:42.340> effect<00:00:43.210> and<00:00:43.720> the<00:00:43.750> same<00:00:44.470> goes<00:00:44.500> for

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.130 
thrusting effect and the same goes for

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.569 
thrusting effect and the same goes for
the<00:00:46.470> tilting<00:00:47.470> effects<00:00:47.920> of<00:00:48.130> the<00:00:48.310> main<00:00:48.520> road

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
the tilting effects of the main road

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.430 
the tilting effects of the main road
itself<00:00:50.239> is<00:00:50.359> not<00:00:50.510> similar

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
itself is not similar

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.990 
itself is not similar
problems<00:00:53.070> tilt

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.220 

tilting<00:00:56.780> segways<00:00:57.140> so

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
tilting segways so

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.410 
tilting segways so
this<00:00:59.860> thing<00:01:00.340> is<00:01:00.520> pretty<00:01:00.730> pictures<00:01:01.180> pretty

I'm<00:01:03.719> not<00:01:03.870> an<00:01:04.049> excellent<00:01:04.530> old<00:01:04.710> college<00:01:05.250> so<00:01:05.610> I

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
I'm not an excellent old college so I

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.190 
I'm not an excellent old college so I
crashed<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.380> quite<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> bit<00:01:08.869> but<00:01:09.869> still

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
crashed it quite a bit but still

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.410 
crashed it quite a bit but still
but<00:01:11.380> London<00:01:11.950> here

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.350 

tail<00:01:17.420> gears<00:01:20.619> well<00:01:21.619> put<00:01:21.950> some<00:01:22.700> tailgates<00:01:23.149> hair

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
tail gears well put some tailgates hair

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.100 
tail gears well put some tailgates hair
from<00:01:23.770> fighter<00:01:24.770> planes<00:01:25.159> that<00:01:25.430> I've<00:01:25.789> made<00:01:26.110> of

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
from fighter planes that I've made of

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.749 
from fighter planes that I've made of
course<00:01:27.289> these<00:01:27.470> parts<00:01:27.860> aren't<00:01:27.979> textured<00:01:28.490> yet

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
course these parts aren't textured yet

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.990 
course these parts aren't textured yet
so<00:01:29.750> they<00:01:29.899> don't<00:01:30.229> look<00:01:30.409> too<00:01:30.740> good<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:31.460> this

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
so they don't look too good and this

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.789 
so they don't look too good and this
thing<00:01:32.179> is<00:01:32.240> always<00:01:32.479> spinning<00:01:32.869> this<00:01:33.200> why

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
thing is always spinning this why

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.980 
thing is always spinning this why
wouldn't<00:01:34.009> it<00:01:34.420> I'm<00:01:35.420> also<00:01:35.990> going<00:01:36.229> to<00:01:37.750> show<00:01:38.750> you<00:01:38.810> a

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
wouldn't it I'm also going to show you a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.169 
wouldn't it I'm also going to show you a
smaller<00:01:39.560> model<00:01:41.890> of<00:01:42.890> the<00:01:43.310> helicopter<00:01:43.909> earlier

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
smaller model of the helicopter earlier

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.770 
smaller model of the helicopter earlier
tests<00:01:45.110> not<00:01:45.710> sure<00:01:46.070> will<00:01:47.000> be<00:01:47.210> set<00:01:47.390> up<00:01:47.509> quite

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
tests not sure will be set up quite

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.830 
tests not sure will be set up quite
correctly<00:01:48.110> but<00:01:48.319> I<00:01:48.470> just<00:01:48.709> finished<00:01:49.539> yes<00:01:50.539> you

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
correctly but I just finished yes you

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.490 
correctly but I just finished yes you
can<00:01:50.990> see<00:01:51.319> this<00:01:52.159> thing<00:01:52.459> is<00:01:52.940> kind<00:01:53.600> of<00:01:53.990> messed<00:01:54.289> up

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:54.500 
can see this thing is kind of messed up

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.490 
can see this thing is kind of messed up
right<00:01:54.979> now<00:01:55.039> I<00:01:55.429> just<00:01:55.700> turn<00:01:56.119> it<00:01:56.240> around<00:01:56.360> and<00:01:56.929> it

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
right now I just turn it around and it

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.699 
right now I just turn it around and it
took<00:01:57.770> good<00:01:57.979> to<00:01:58.220> go<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:59.170> think<00:02:00.170> all<00:02:00.349> the<00:02:00.470> branches

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:00.709 
took good to go I think all the branches

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:02.649 
took good to go I think all the branches
are<00:02:01.009> pretty<00:02:01.069> much<00:02:01.399> the<00:02:01.459> same<00:02:01.580> so<00:02:01.819> we'll<00:02:02.420> just

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
are pretty much the same so we'll just

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:09.219 
are pretty much the same so we'll just
see<00:02:02.840> how<00:02:03.020> I<00:02:03.049> think<00:02:03.409> I'll<00:02:03.619> missing<00:02:04.099> place<00:02:08.229> I've

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
see how I think I'll missing place I've

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.620 
see how I think I'll missing place I've
experienced<00:02:10.099> early<00:02:10.429> that<00:02:10.670> the<00:02:10.849> small<00:02:11.299> craft

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
experienced early that the small craft

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.910 
experienced early that the small craft
are<00:02:12.580> harder<00:02:14.170> little<00:02:15.170> time<00:02:15.380> necessary<00:02:15.650> wait<00:02:16.160> to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
are harder little time necessary wait to

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.160 
are harder little time necessary wait to
allow<00:02:18.920> me<00:02:19.190> not<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.880> just<00:02:20.060> run<00:02:20.570> straight<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:20.959> the

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
allow me not to just run straight to the

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.110 
allow me not to just run straight to the
ground<00:02:21.440> and<00:02:21.650> crash<00:02:22.100> whenever

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:35.030 

oh<00:02:25.409> and<00:02:26.409> also<00:02:26.769> because<00:02:29.310> everything<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.940> be

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
oh and also because everything to be

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.089 
oh and also because everything to be
rotating<00:02:36.040> is<00:02:36.280> no<00:02:36.489> longer<00:02:36.730> rotating<00:02:37.330> it's

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
rotating is no longer rotating it's

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.809 
rotating is no longer rotating it's
tilting<00:02:40.319> well<00:02:41.319> it's<00:02:41.739> like<00:02:42.400> you<00:02:42.430> to<00:02:42.640> become

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
tilting well it's like you to become

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:51.990 
tilting well it's like you to become
better<00:02:44.069> let's<00:02:45.069> try<00:02:45.250> again<00:02:50.579> you<00:02:51.579> have<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.760> turn

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
better let's try again you have to turn

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.899 
better let's try again you have to turn
I<00:02:52.209> CSO<00:02:52.720> for<00:02:53.409> this<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:53.829> work<00:02:54.159> properly

00:02:54.899 --> 00:02:54.909 
I CSO for this to work properly

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.550 
I CSO for this to work properly
otherwise<00:02:55.450> you'll<00:02:55.840> have<00:02:55.870> very<00:02:56.349> little

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
otherwise you'll have very little

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.059 
otherwise you'll have very little
control<00:02:56.980> of<00:02:57.310> tilts

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:00.069 
control of tilts

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:03.509 
control of tilts
now<00:03:00.670> you<00:03:00.730> can<00:03:00.999> see<00:03:01.239> I<00:03:01.659> actually<00:03:02.310> need<00:03:03.310> to

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
now you can see I actually need to

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.910 
now you can see I actually need to
remember<00:03:03.670> what's<00:03:04.439> tilting<00:03:05.439> and<00:03:05.620> what's

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
remember what's tilting and what's

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.379 
remember what's tilting and what's
rotating<00:03:07.049> levitating<00:03:08.049> isms<00:03:08.379> you<00:03:08.680> need<00:03:09.389> before

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:10.389 
rotating levitating isms you need before

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:14.550 
rotating levitating isms you need before
it<00:03:10.629> was<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:10.989> AMD

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.740 

use<00:03:15.190> a<00:03:15.790> vertical
