is to pull them off but it's not
particularly<00:01:17.170> good<00:01:18.060> what<00:01:19.060> we<00:01:19.720> need<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:20.170> do<00:01:20.350> is

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
particularly good what we need to do is

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.000 
particularly good what we need to do is
when<00:01:21.430> you<00:01:21.610> take<00:01:21.850> them<00:01:22.090> off<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:23.380> need<00:01:23.530> to<00:01:23.590> keep

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.440 
when you take them off you need to keep
we<00:01:24.760> can<00:01:24.880> look<00:01:25.030> in<00:01:25.180> here<00:01:25.420> a<00:01:26.190> piece<00:01:27.190> of<00:01:27.400> stalk<00:01:27.700> so

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
we can look in here a piece of stalk so

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.560 
we can look in here a piece of stalk so
it<00:01:28.570> doesn't<00:01:28.840> rot<00:01:28.990> in<00:01:29.229> and<00:01:29.979> this<00:01:30.940> is<00:01:31.000> one<00:01:31.450> of<00:01:31.510> the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
it doesn't rot in and this is one of the

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.600 
it doesn't rot in and this is one of the
medium-sized<00:01:32.170> ones<00:01:32.440> we've<00:01:32.680> grown<00:01:32.860> what<00:01:33.580> I

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
medium-sized ones we've grown what I

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.149 
medium-sized ones we've grown what I
love<00:01:33.940> about<00:01:34.060> this<00:01:34.479> is<00:01:34.750> that<00:01:34.780> when<00:01:35.200> we<00:01:35.500> start<00:01:36.010> to

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:36.159 
love about this is that when we start to

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.510 
love about this is that when we start to
use<00:01:36.220> this<00:01:36.549> you<00:01:37.060> can<00:01:37.090> actually<00:01:37.299> take<00:01:37.720> segments

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
use this you can actually take segments

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.940 
use this you can actually take segments
we<00:01:39.520> tend<00:01:39.820> to<00:01:39.880> use<00:01:40.119> it<00:01:40.390> two<00:01:41.200> main<00:01:41.440> ways<00:01:41.650> really

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
we tend to use it two main ways really

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.240 
we tend to use it two main ways really
we<00:01:42.280> bake<00:01:42.580> it<00:01:42.850> and<00:01:43.780> make<00:01:44.320> a<00:01:44.350> really<00:01:44.770> really<00:01:44.920> nice

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250
