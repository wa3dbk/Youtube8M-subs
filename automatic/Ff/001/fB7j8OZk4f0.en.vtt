my display hutches that i've talked
about<00:00:37.860> several<00:00:38.040> times<00:00:38.250> before<00:00:38.489> but<00:00:39.239> all<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
about several times before but all the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.750 
about several times before but all the
boxes<00:00:40.170> for<00:00:40.320> those<00:00:40.469> consoles<00:00:40.860> are<00:00:41.070> here

somewhere<00:00:42.270> on<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.629> massive<00:00:42.960> wall<00:00:43.110> that's

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
somewhere on this massive wall that's

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.000 
somewhere on this massive wall that's
just<00:00:43.590> covered<00:00:44.040> an<00:00:44.100> n64<00:00:44.460> stuff<00:00:45.320> these<00:00:46.320> boxes<00:00:46.890> I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
just covered an n64 stuff these boxes I

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.799 
just covered an n64 stuff these boxes I
can<00:00:47.219> clearly<00:00:47.489> just<00:00:47.789> turn<00:00:47.910> sideways<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.420> line

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
can clearly just turn sideways and line

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.500 
can clearly just turn sideways and line
all<00:00:49.050> them<00:00:49.320> up<00:00:49.440> above<00:00:49.950> where<00:00:50.879> that<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.180> they're

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
all them up above where that is they're

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.689 
all them up above where that is they're
above<00:00:52.230> all<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.500> shelves<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.010> eventually

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
above all the shelves and eventually

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:54.920 
above all the shelves and eventually
I'll<00:00:53.789> probably<00:00:54.000> do<00:00:54.239> that<00:00:54.390> as<00:00:54.570> they<00:00:54.690> collect

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
I'll probably do that as they collect

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.600 
I'll probably do that as they collect
more<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.350> stuff<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.100> as<00:00:56.250> my<00:00:56.430> collection

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
more and more stuff and as my collection

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.270 
more and more stuff and as my collection
grows<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.270> now<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.379> couch<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:58.829> kind<00:00:59.219> of

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
grows I now have a couch now kind of

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.799 
grows I now have a couch now kind of
covering<00:00:59.609> part<00:00:59.820> of<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.940> wall<00:01:00.090> gotten<00:01:00.629> got

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
covering part of the wall gotten got

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.009 
covering part of the wall gotten got
more<00:01:00.960> seating<00:01:01.260> area<00:01:01.559> but<00:01:02.550> this<00:01:02.940> entire<00:01:03.270> shelf

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
more seating area but this entire shelf

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.990 
more seating area but this entire shelf
that's<00:01:04.199> n64<00:01:04.769> stuff<00:01:05.010> I<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.309> definitely<00:01:05.610> expand

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
that's n64 stuff I can definitely expand

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.789 
that's n64 stuff I can definitely expand
this<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.840> by<00:01:06.960> displaying<00:01:07.470> them<00:01:07.619> in<00:01:07.710> a

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
this just by displaying them in a

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:10.219 
this just by displaying them in a
different<00:01:07.979> way<00:01:08.270> my<00:01:09.270> room<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.720> pretty<00:01:09.900> much<00:01:10.020> at

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
different way my room is pretty much at

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.070 
different way my room is pretty much at
capacity<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:11.100> have<00:01:11.520> I<00:01:11.939> think<00:01:12.210> 10<00:01:12.540> shelves<00:01:12.990> in

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
capacity I have I think 10 shelves in

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.410 
capacity I have I think 10 shelves in
here<00:01:13.110> now<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> lot<00:01:15.000> of<00:01:15.030> room<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.390> I

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
here now so I have a lot of room that I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.190 
here now so I have a lot of room that I
can<00:01:15.570> grow<00:01:15.720> into<00:01:16.040> but<00:01:17.040> for<00:01:17.310> example<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.630> entire

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
can grow into but for example the entire

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.730 
can grow into but for example the entire
side<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.830> room<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.189> 64<00:01:20.700> stuff<00:01:21.500> these<00:01:22.500> two

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
side of the room and 64 stuff these two

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.340 
side of the room and 64 stuff these two
shelves<00:01:22.979> here<00:01:23.220> are<00:01:23.430> just<00:01:23.700> games<00:01:24.270> so<00:01:25.200> they're

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
shelves here are just games so they're

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.640 
shelves here are just games so they're
ours

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
ours

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.310 
ours
I<00:01:25.830> can<00:01:26.700> probably<00:01:26.850> fit<00:01:27.090> 500<00:01:27.540> games<00:01:27.689> on<00:01:27.900> here<00:01:28.049> and

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
I can probably fit 500 games on here and

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.210 
I can probably fit 500 games on here and
all<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.900> games<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.170> see<00:01:31.350> here<00:01:31.560> all<00:01:31.710> the

what<00:01:34.170> I'm<00:01:34.290> going<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.530> eventually<00:01:34.829> do<00:01:35.100> is<00:01:35.220> put

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
what I'm going to eventually do is put

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.350 
what I'm going to eventually do is put
all<00:01:35.520> those<00:01:35.930> behind<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.740> boxes<00:01:38.220> because<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.119> can

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
all those behind the boxes because I can

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.929 
all those behind the boxes because I can

so this collecting tip obviously had to

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.960 
so this collecting tip obviously had to
came<00:02:54.540> after<00:02:55.139> or<00:02:55.349> come<00:02:55.709> after<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.669> one<00:02:56.790> where<00:02:56.939> I
