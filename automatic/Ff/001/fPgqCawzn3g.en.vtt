showing<00:02:47.160> well<00:02:48.160> this<00:02:48.370> is<00:02:48.400> for<00:02:48.910> example<00:02:49.000> this<00:02:49.330> is

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
showing well this is for example this is

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.770 
showing well this is for example this is
a<00:02:49.510> DVD<00:02:50.170> that's<00:02:50.650> been<00:02:50.860> copied<00:02:51.310> over<00:02:51.520> and<00:02:51.780> it's

idea<00:02:58.000> if<00:02:58.240> you<00:02:58.540> select<00:02:58.720> flicks<00:02:59.080> of<00:02:59.230> just

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
idea if you select flicks of just

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.750 
idea if you select flicks of just
remembering<00:02:59.800> where<00:02:59.920> you're<00:03:00.040> up<00:03:00.100> to<00:03:00.280> then<00:03:00.550> this

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
remembering where you're up to then this

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.460 
remembering where you're up to then this
is<00:03:00.910> exactly<00:03:01.240> what<00:03:01.480> you<00:03:01.540> want<00:03:01.720> okay<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.230> can

is exactly what you want okay you can
pick<00:03:02.650> which<00:03:02.980> server<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.970> want<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.270> use<00:03:04.450> for<00:03:04.480> it

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
pick which server you want to use for it

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.190 
pick which server you want to use for it
if<00:03:05.230> you've<00:03:05.350> got<00:03:05.440> multiple<00:03:05.590> plex<00:03:06.490> servers<00:03:06.940> I

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
if you've got multiple plex servers I

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.870 
if you've got multiple plex servers I
haven't<00:03:08.200> has<00:03:08.440> got<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.680> one<00:03:08.830> so<00:03:09.130> it<00:03:09.400> detects<00:03:09.790> it

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
haven't has got the one so it detects it

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.790 
haven't has got the one so it detects it
automatically<00:03:10.360> so<00:03:10.990> to<00:03:11.050> get<00:03:11.260> this<00:03:11.410> you<00:03:11.560> need<00:03:11.680> to

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:11.800 
automatically so to get this you need to

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:13.949 
automatically so to get this you need to
have<00:03:11.950> the<00:03:11.980> latest<00:03:12.280> plex<00:03:12.700> server<00:03:13.120> four<00:03:13.690> point

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:09.430 
versions for the linux as well as for
windows<00:05:05.840> you<00:05:06.470> need<00:05:06.759> plates<00:05:07.759> paths<00:05:08.210> and<00:05:08.539> an

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
windows you need plates paths and an

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.740 
windows you need plates paths and an
xbox<00:05:09.680> one<00:05:10.069> there's<00:05:10.400> also<00:05:10.520> the<00:05:10.639> xbox<00:05:10.909> 360<00:05:11.449> guess

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
xbox one there's also the xbox 360 guess

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:12.820 
xbox one there's also the xbox 360 guess
that's<00:05:11.990> going<00:05:12.139> to<00:05:12.199> look<00:05:12.319> very<00:05:12.349> similar<00:05:12.680> to

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:12.830 
that's going to look very similar to

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:14.589 
that's going to look very similar to
this<00:05:13.039> but<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:13.610> last<00:05:13.789> thing<00:05:13.940> is<00:05:14.120> as<00:05:14.300> well<00:05:14.449> this

00:05:14.589 --> 00:05:14.599 
this but the last thing is as well this

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:16.149 
this but the last thing is as well this
is<00:05:14.720> now<00:05:14.870> all<00:05:15.080> interact<00:05:15.560> across<00:05:15.680> all<00:05:16.009> my

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:16.159 
is now all interact across all my

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:18.129 
is now all interact across all my
devices<00:05:16.460> so<00:05:16.940> i<00:05:16.970> can<00:05:17.240> start<00:05:17.449> watching<00:05:17.900> it<00:05:18.020> on

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:18.139 
devices so i can start watching it on

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.230 
devices so i can start watching it on
one<00:05:18.620> device<00:05:18.860> go<00:05:19.159> to<00:05:19.220> another<00:05:19.520> device<00:05:19.819> and<00:05:20.090> so

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:20.240 
one device go to another device and so

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.939 
one device go to another device and so
on<00:05:20.360> it's<00:05:20.509> all<00:05:20.659> really<00:05:21.349> well<00:05:21.590> integrated

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:21.949 
on it's all really well integrated

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:26.370 
on it's all really well integrated
together<00:05:23.560> so<00:05:24.560> that's<00:05:24.680> Plex<00:05:25.009> on<00:05:25.280> the<00:05:25.460> Xbox<00:05:25.849> one

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:26.380 
together so that's Plex on the Xbox one
