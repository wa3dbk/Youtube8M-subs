00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
issue of lag and connection problems and

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.250 
issue of lag and connection problems and
I<00:02:18.620> hear<00:02:18.859> so<00:02:19.099> many<00:02:19.279> people<00:02:19.790> just<00:02:20.019> raging<00:02:21.019> about

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
I hear so many people just raging about

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.470 
I hear so many people just raging about
all<00:02:21.519> this<00:02:22.519> person<00:02:23.269> is<00:02:23.389> sponging<00:02:23.959> my

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
all this person is sponging my

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.440 
all this person is sponging my
bullets<00:02:24.750> don't<00:02:24.810> register<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:27.000> thing<00:02:27.269> with

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
bullets don't register the thing with

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.809 
bullets don't register the thing with
this<00:02:27.599> game<00:02:27.900> is<00:02:28.140> if<00:02:28.409> you're<00:02:28.890> lagging<00:02:29.129> well<00:02:29.519> at

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
this game is if you're lagging well at

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:31.550 
this game is if you're lagging well at
least<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.360> I<00:02:30.390> find<00:02:30.810> is<00:02:31.140> that<00:02:31.170> if<00:02:31.440> you're

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
least that I find is that if you're

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.289 
least that I find is that if you're
lagging<00:02:31.799> you<00:02:32.159> can't<00:02:32.430> retell<00:02:32.909> that<00:02:32.940> you're

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
lagging you can't retell that you're

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.390 
lagging you can't retell that you're
lagging<00:02:33.540> until<00:02:34.170> you<00:02:34.290> actually<00:02:34.440> fires<00:02:34.920> you

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
lagging until you actually fires you

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
lagging until you actually fires you
know<00:02:35.519> your<00:02:36.120> gun<00:02:36.330> and<00:02:37.790> you<00:02:38.790> know<00:02:38.819> they<00:02:39.390> don't

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
know your gun and you know they don't

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.759 
know your gun and you know they don't

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
bt infinity which guys who don't know

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.449 
bt infinity which guys who don't know
it's<00:02:49.500> an<00:02:50.209> isp<00:02:51.209> in<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.390> UK<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.989> is<00:02:52.860> fiber

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
it's an isp in the UK that is fiber

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.030 
it's an isp in the UK that is fiber
optic<00:02:53.909> so<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.720> get<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:54.900> low<00:02:55.110> ping<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:55.890> know<00:02:56.010> a

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.559 
pulled the trigger once and don't really
bother<00:03:11.310> firing<00:03:11.760> again<00:03:11.849> because<00:03:12.269> I'm<00:03:12.420> that

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 
bother firing again because I'm that

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.589 
bother firing again because I'm that
confident<00:03:13.140> that<00:03:13.459> they're<00:03:14.459> going<00:03:14.579> to<00:03:14.640> drop<00:03:14.910> but

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
confident that they're going to drop but

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.809 
confident that they're going to drop but
I<00:03:15.629> have<00:03:15.900> talked<00:03:16.109> to<00:03:16.200> other<00:03:16.379> people<00:03:16.819> especially

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
I have talked to other people especially

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.880 
I have talked to other people especially
reviewed<00:03:18.510> my<00:03:18.660> other<00:03:18.840> videos<00:03:19.170> that<00:03:19.500> have<00:03:19.590> said

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
reviewed my other videos that have said

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.670 
reviewed my other videos that have said
they<00:03:20.099> never<00:03:20.400> really<00:03:20.730> get<00:03:21.390> you<00:03:21.660> know<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:22.049> one

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
they never really get you know a one

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.339 
they never really get you know a one
burst<00:03:22.920> kill<00:03:23.190> with<00:03:23.340> type<00:03:23.609> 95<00:03:23.910> so<00:03:24.359> they<00:03:24.959> tend<00:03:25.230> to

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
burst kill with type 95 so they tend to

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.900 
burst kill with type 95 so they tend to
avoid<00:03:25.530> using<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.239> but<00:03:27.239> yeah<00:03:28.140> I<00:03:28.799> I<00:03:29.700> haven't
