00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.560 

I<00:00:15.359> think<00:00:16.359> we<00:00:16.600> need<00:00:17.500> to<00:00:17.770> see<00:00:18.430> from<00:00:18.939> the<00:00:19.180> customer

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
I think we need to see from the customer

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.769 
I think we need to see from the customer
perspective<00:00:19.860> and<00:00:20.860> as<00:00:21.849> a<00:00:21.910> customer<00:00:22.360> I<00:00:22.570> would

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
perspective and as a customer I would

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.279 
perspective and as a customer I would
say<00:00:22.960> and<00:00:23.590> they<00:00:24.130> will<00:00:24.310> look<00:00:24.430> for<00:00:24.490> when<00:00:24.939> they

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
say and they will look for when they

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.420 
say and they will look for when they
call<00:00:26.289> the<00:00:26.410> core<00:00:26.619> tenets<00:00:26.919> they<00:00:27.070> look<00:00:27.220> for

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:27.430 
call the core tenets they look for

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:30.300 
call the core tenets they look for
accuracy<00:00:28.000> well<00:00:28.390> as<00:00:28.509> the<00:00:28.869> information<00:00:29.310> they

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
accuracy well as the information they

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.920 
accuracy well as the information they
get<00:00:30.460> from<00:00:30.520> the<00:00:30.880> cause<00:00:31.239> and<00:00:31.390> agents<00:00:31.809> are

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
get from the cause and agents are

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.030 
get from the cause and agents are
correct<00:00:32.259> and<00:00:32.850> they<00:00:33.850> they<00:00:34.780> would<00:00:35.440> not<00:00:35.739> fall

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:36.040 
correct and they they would not fall

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.110 
correct and they they would not fall
consistency<00:00:36.820> so<00:00:37.530> whoever's<00:00:38.530> on<00:00:38.710> the<00:00:38.770> phone

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
consistency so whoever's on the phone

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.630 
consistency so whoever's on the phone
whenever<00:00:40.350> they<00:00:41.350> make<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.680> call<00:00:41.890> so<00:00:42.460> the

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
whenever they make the call so the

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.200 
whenever they make the call so the
answer<00:00:43.059> has<00:00:43.239> to<00:00:43.390> be<00:00:43.510> consistent<00:00:44.230> and<00:00:45.210> the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
answer has to be consistent and the

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:48.899 
answer has to be consistent and the
customer<00:00:46.809> experience<00:00:47.110> would<00:00:47.589> be<00:00:48.039> a<00:00:48.249> model<00:00:48.609> no

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
customer experience would be a model no

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.889 
customer experience would be a model no
more<00:00:49.179> that's<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:49.570> same<00:00:49.809> and<00:00:50.499> I<00:00:51.359> also<00:00:52.359> same

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
more that's the same and I also same

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.919 
more that's the same and I also same
thing<00:00:53.649> they<00:00:54.339> will<00:00:54.489> look<00:00:54.579> at<00:00:54.789> how<00:00:55.390> large<00:00:55.659> you've

00:00:55.919 --> 00:00:55.929 
thing they will look at how large you've

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:58.020 
thing they will look at how large you've
always<00:00:56.109> a<00:00:56.350> cause<00:00:56.679> an<00:00:56.829> agent<00:00:57.219> whether<00:00:57.699> they<00:00:57.909> are

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
always a cause an agent whether they are

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.689 
always a cause an agent whether they are
able<00:00:58.179> to<00:00:58.329> answer<00:00:58.839> the<00:00:58.989> the<00:00:59.519> question<00:01:00.519> to

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
able to answer the the question to

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:03.809 
able to answer the the question to
fulfill<00:01:00.999> the<00:01:01.120> need<00:01:01.300> and<00:01:02.219> yes<00:01:03.219> they<00:01:03.489> cannot

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:03.819 
fulfill the need and yes they cannot

00:01:03.819 --> 00:01:06.930 
fulfill the need and yes they cannot
provide<00:01:04.330> the<00:01:04.510> solution<00:01:05.159> how<00:01:06.159> long<00:01:06.430> will<00:01:06.760> they

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:06.940 
provide the solution how long will they

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:09.690 
provide the solution how long will they
can<00:01:07.180> provide<00:01:07.870> other<00:01:08.440> alternative<00:01:09.159> in<00:01:09.430> order

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
can provide other alternative in order

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.890 
can provide other alternative in order
to<00:01:10.500> make<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:11.590> customer<00:01:12.040> satisfied<00:01:12.820> its<00:01:13.659> food

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
to make the customer satisfied its food

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
to make the customer satisfied its food
a<00:01:13.930> call<00:01:14.229> and<00:01:15.040> the<00:01:15.250> last<00:01:15.430> thing<00:01:15.640> I<00:01:15.760> think<00:01:16.120> is<00:01:16.420> the

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
a call and the last thing I think is the

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.500 
a call and the last thing I think is the
the<00:01:18.549> first<00:01:18.820> call<00:01:19.030> resolution<00:01:19.560> there<00:01:20.560> is<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.740> say

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
the first call resolution there is a say

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.450 
the first call resolution there is a say
they<00:01:22.510> would<00:01:22.720> hope<00:01:22.930> to<00:01:23.380> make<00:01:23.560> one<00:01:23.740> call<00:01:23.980> and<00:01:24.190> get

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
they would hope to make one call and get

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.580 
they would hope to make one call and get
all<00:01:24.640> the<00:01:24.760> all<00:01:25.120> those<00:01:25.270> answer<00:01:25.690> and<00:01:26.230> without

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
all the all those answer and without

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.920 
all the all those answer and without
being<00:01:26.860> a<00:01:27.130> Chancellor<00:01:27.640> to<00:01:27.940> to<00:01:28.420> harder<00:01:28.750> at<00:01:28.900> a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
being a Chancellor to to harder at a

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.520 
being a Chancellor to to harder at a
department<00:01:29.260> or<00:01:29.590> having<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.970> customer<00:01:31.150> to<00:01:31.530> go

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
department or having the customer to go

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.260 
department or having the customer to go
back<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.450> when<00:01:35.020> we<00:01:35.140> define<00:01:35.350> all<00:01:35.710> those<00:01:36.270> four

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
back so so when we define all those four

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.680 
back so so when we define all those four
four<00:01:37.870> key<00:01:38.140> elements<00:01:39.070> so<00:01:39.400> we<00:01:39.580> need<00:01:39.760> to<00:01:40.150> have<00:01:40.660> a

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
four key elements so we need to have a

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.620 
four key elements so we need to have a
mechanism<00:01:40.960> to<00:01:41.500> ensure<00:01:42.280> that<00:01:42.460> happens<00:01:43.270> they

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:43.630 
mechanism to ensure that happens they

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.860 
mechanism to ensure that happens they
even<00:01:43.930> do<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.890> course<00:01:45.220> and<00:01:45.400> have<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:45.870> proper

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
even do the course and have a proper

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.740 
even do the course and have a proper
Quality<00:01:47.830> Assurance<00:01:47.920> mechanism<00:01:48.820> is<00:01:49.360> something

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
Quality Assurance mechanism is something

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.080 
Quality Assurance mechanism is something
like<00:01:50.170> they<00:01:50.440> have<00:01:50.680> a<00:01:50.710> proper<00:01:51.130> plan<00:01:51.760> fire

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
like they have a proper plan fire

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.080 
like they have a proper plan fire
prevention<00:01:52.480> measures<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:54.310> quality<00:01:54.670> assurance

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
prevention measures so quality assurance

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
prevention measures so quality assurance
is<00:01:55.300> kind<00:01:56.020> of<00:01:56.490> preventing<00:01:57.490> the<00:01:57.760> fire<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.390> do<00:01:58.870> to

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
is kind of preventing the fire to do to

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.730 
is kind of preventing the fire to do to
happen<00:01:59.440> so<00:02:00.130> when<00:02:01.090> I<00:02:01.120> see<00:02:01.720> someone<00:02:02.050> causality

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
happen so when I see someone causality

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.580 
happen so when I see someone causality
they<00:02:03.100> are<00:02:03.160> very<00:02:03.310> busy<00:02:03.990> train<00:02:04.990> they<00:02:05.170> are<00:02:05.200> they

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 
they are very busy train they are they

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.169 
they are very busy train they are they
are<00:02:05.740> firefighting<00:02:07.080> because<00:02:08.080> they<00:02:08.739> have

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
are firefighting because they have

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.910 
are firefighting because they have
people<00:02:10.179> handling<00:02:10.810> all<00:02:10.959> those<00:02:11.080> complain<00:02:11.590> and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
people handling all those complain and

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.630 
people handling all those complain and
and<00:02:12.900> follow<00:02:13.900> up<00:02:13.989> on<00:02:14.170> those<00:02:14.530> case<00:02:14.860> which<00:02:15.430> I'm

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
and follow up on those case which I'm

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.850 
and follow up on those case which I'm
miss<00:02:16.120> out<00:02:16.269> through<00:02:16.989> through<00:02:17.379> the<00:02:17.440> strata

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
miss out through through the strata

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.580 
miss out through through the strata
process<00:02:18.370> so<00:02:18.970> if<00:02:19.209> that<00:02:20.640> process<00:02:21.640> is

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
process so if that process is

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.770 
process so if that process is
available<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.830> would<00:02:24.129> think<00:02:24.459> they<00:02:25.269> will<00:02:25.510> have

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
available I would think they will have

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.960 
available I would think they will have
less<00:02:26.019> chance<00:02:26.409> to<00:02:26.769> really<00:02:27.190> have<00:02:27.610> to<00:02:27.700> fight<00:02:27.940> a

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
less chance to really have to fight a

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:28.470 
less chance to really have to fight a
fire

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
fire

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.250 
fire
brother<00:02:28.750> brother<00:02:29.349> them<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:30.250> I<00:02:30.959> think<00:02:31.959> the

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
brother brother them so I think the

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.160 
brother brother them so I think the
Quality<00:02:33.250> Assurance<00:02:33.420> mechanism<00:02:34.420> when<00:02:34.569> when

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170 
Quality Assurance mechanism when when

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.789 
Quality Assurance mechanism when when
when<00:02:35.590> they<00:02:35.799> are<00:02:35.920> working<00:02:36.129> and<00:02:37.030> effective

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
when they are working and effective

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:41.580 
when they are working and effective
effectively<00:02:38.799> is<00:02:39.160> kind<00:02:40.120> of<00:02:40.209> seamless<00:02:40.840> to<00:02:41.440> the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
effectively is kind of seamless to the

I think the kimeta also need to and
provide<00:03:07.359> the<00:03:07.629> quality<00:03:08.079> assurance<00:03:09.870> action<00:03:10.870> and

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:11.200 
provide the quality assurance action and

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.809 
provide the quality assurance action and
also<00:03:11.739> the<00:03:11.859> trainer<00:03:12.209> and<00:03:13.769> they<00:03:14.769> are<00:03:15.040> I<00:03:15.340> think

our<00:04:51.090> team<00:04:51.509> so<00:04:52.470> because<00:04:53.160> one<00:04:53.970> of<00:04:54.000> the<00:04:54.210> Bragan

00:04:54.589 --> 00:04:54.599 
our team so because one of the Bragan

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:57.170 
our team so because one of the Bragan
will<00:04:55.199> promise<00:04:55.650> that<00:04:55.710> I<00:04:56.130> will<00:04:56.430> think<00:04:56.729> most<00:04:57.030> of

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
will promise that I will think most of

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.999 
will promise that I will think most of
the<00:04:57.360> households<00:04:57.990> in<00:04:58.050> cotton<00:04:58.440> that<00:04:58.590> they<00:04:58.800> need

00:04:58.999 --> 00:04:59.009 
the households in cotton that they need

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:01.100 
the households in cotton that they need
that<00:04:59.340> because<00:04:59.910> of<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.180> client<00:05:00.539> requirement

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
that because of the client requirement

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:06.140 
that because of the client requirement
and<00:05:01.650> also<00:05:02.460> for<00:05:02.699> the<00:05:04.370> cosine<00:05:05.370> that<00:05:05.520> they<00:05:05.970> need

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
and also for the cosine that they need

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.900 
and also for the cosine that they need
to<00:05:06.389> have<00:05:06.509> the<00:05:06.660> people<00:05:06.900> to<00:05:07.830> listen<00:05:08.580> to<00:05:08.729> the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
to have the people to listen to the

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.430 
to have the people to listen to the
court<00:05:09.150> and<00:05:09.740> give<00:05:10.740> to<00:05:11.130> the<00:05:11.250> marks<00:05:11.669> on<00:05:11.970> the

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.440 
court and give to the marks on the

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.070 
court and give to the marks on the
scorecard<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.680> then<00:05:14.270> the<00:05:15.270> maths<00:05:15.510> will<00:05:15.900> be

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
incentive scheme I would look at the QA

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.210

people<00:05:39.110> to<00:05:41.539> score<00:05:42.539> and<00:05:42.990> then<00:05:43.020> the<00:05:43.620> score<00:05:43.949> would

people to score and then the score would

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:51.649

link up to the using scheme and so if

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
and I also asked all those people to

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.390 
and I also asked all those people to
also<00:06:27.360> look<00:06:27.570> at<00:06:27.780> the<00:06:27.990> good<00:06:28.560> things<00:06:28.800> at<00:06:29.220> the

also look at the good things at the

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:35.090

after after the call monitoring session

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:42.500 
after after the call monitoring session
they<00:06:38.850> have<00:06:39.750> the<00:06:39.900> agents<00:06:40.820> come<00:06:41.820> in<00:06:41.970> to<00:06:42.330> have<00:06:42.479> a

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
they have the agents come in to have a

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.170 
they have the agents come in to have a
coaching<00:06:43.020> session<00:06:43.280> if<00:06:44.280> every<00:06:44.820> time<00:06:45.000> the

coaching session if every time the
coaching<00:06:46.190> confine<00:06:47.190> or<00:06:47.430> focusing<00:06:48.270> on<00:06:48.419> on<00:06:48.900> the

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:52.040 
wrong thing they they have been doing so

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:54.950 
wrong thing they they have been doing so
there<00:06:53.040> will<00:06:53.190> be<00:06:53.250> a<00:06:53.400> negative<00:06:53.639> experience<00:06:53.970> so

00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
there will be a negative experience so

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:57.740 
there will be a negative experience so
rather<00:06:55.550> they<00:06:56.550> have<00:06:56.820> the<00:06:57.090> the<00:06:57.330> coaching

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:57.750 
rather they have the the coaching

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:00.020 
rather they have the the coaching
session<00:06:58.139> as<00:06:58.290> well<00:06:58.530> as<00:06:58.650> the<00:06:59.030> monitoring
