00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:08.330 
designed the dual cyclonic technology
that<00:04:03.540> went<00:04:03.719> into<00:04:04.109> every<00:04:04.230> phantom<00:04:05.040> and<00:04:07.340> now

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
that went into every phantom and now

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.729 
that went into every phantom and now
I've<00:04:08.549> not<00:04:08.790> seen<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.569> very<00:04:09.870> very<00:04:10.169> early

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
I've not seen the very very early

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.539 
I've not seen the very very early
phantoms<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.489> were<00:04:11.699> sold<00:04:12.060> over<00:04:12.659> in<00:04:12.750> the<00:04:12.870> UK

phantoms that were sold over in the UK

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:19.960 
phantoms that were sold over in the UK
but<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.579> believe<00:04:15.180> they<00:04:15.449> had<00:04:15.750> a<00:04:16.489> handle<00:04:18.470> similar

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
but I believe they had a handle similar

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.240 
but I believe they had a handle similar
to<00:04:20.970> what<00:04:21.150> we<00:04:21.299> have<00:04:21.509> on<00:04:21.659> the<00:04:21.750> phantoms<00:04:22.229> I<00:04:22.500> vote

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
to what we have on the phantoms I vote

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.790 
to what we have on the phantoms I vote
as<00:04:23.610> far<00:04:24.419> as<00:04:24.539> I'm<00:04:24.690> concerned<00:04:25.139> that's<00:04:25.289> the<00:04:25.440> only

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
as far as I'm concerned that's the only

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:30.339 
as far as I'm concerned that's the only
way<00:04:25.919> that<00:04:26.570> they're<00:04:27.570> related<00:04:28.229> to<00:04:28.349> each<00:04:28.500> other

00:04:30.339 --> 00:04:30.349 
way that they're related to each other
