00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
itself so you actually have a regular

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.960 
itself so you actually have a regular
cord<00:04:19.739> which<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.160> can<00:04:20.280> actually<00:04:20.580> swap<00:04:20.820> that

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
cord which you can actually swap that

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:21.590 
cord which you can actually swap that
with<00:04:21.030> you

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
with you

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.200 
with you
more<00:04:21.840> than<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:22.080> strudel<00:04:22.320> cord<00:04:22.760> and<00:04:23.760> to<00:04:23.970> do<00:04:24.090> that

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
more than a strudel cord and to do that

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.850 
more than a strudel cord and to do that
it's<00:04:24.390> a<00:04:24.450> very<00:04:24.600> simple<00:04:24.780> process<00:04:25.110> you<00:04:25.530> can<00:04:25.650> see

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
it's a very simple process you can see

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.130 
it's a very simple process you can see
so<00:04:26.100> you<00:04:26.160> left<00:04:26.610> ear<00:04:26.940> cup<00:04:27.240> all<00:04:27.690> you<00:04:27.810> have<00:04:27.930> to<00:04:28.020> do

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
so you left ear cup all you have to do

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.170 
so you left ear cup all you have to do
just<00:04:28.260> pull<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.620> up<00:04:28.680> it's<00:04:29.070> magnetized<00:04:29.790> this<00:04:30.060> is

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
just pull it up it's magnetized this is

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.900 
just pull it up it's magnetized this is
actually<00:04:31.250> you<00:04:32.250> can<00:04:32.310> actually<00:04:32.610> just<00:04:32.700> pull<00:04:32.880> that

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
actually you can actually just pull that

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.430 
actually you can actually just pull that
out<00:04:33.030> it's<00:04:33.330> magnetized<00:04:33.780> and<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.110> can<00:04:34.230> see

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
out it's magnetized and you can see

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.750 
out it's magnetized and you can see
first<00:04:34.710> of<00:04:34.740> all<00:04:34.860> the<00:04:34.950> strain<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:35.280> detail

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
first of all the strain the detail

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.150 
first of all the strain the detail
within<00:04:36.420> the<00:04:36.630> headset<00:04:36.990> itself<00:04:37.110> and<00:04:37.560> you

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
within the headset itself and you

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.300 
within the headset itself and you
basically<00:04:38.730> push<00:04:39.180> down<00:04:39.480> here<00:04:39.990> push<00:04:40.890> down<00:04:40.920> there

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
basically push down here push down there

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.650 
basically push down here push down there
you<00:04:41.400> can<00:04:41.490> just<00:04:41.640> pull<00:04:41.820> out<00:04:41.850> the<00:04:42.120> cording<00:04:42.540> to

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
you can just pull out the cording to

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.000 
you can just pull out the cording to
change<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.050> cord<00:04:43.290> out<00:04:43.380> so<00:04:43.590> it's<00:04:43.740> a<00:04:43.800> very

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
change the cord out so it's a very

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.130 
change the cord out so it's a very
simple<00:04:44.220> process<00:04:44.520> but<00:04:44.910> you<00:04:45.300> can<00:04:45.390> see<00:04:45.540> me<00:04:45.720> be

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
simple process but you can see me be

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.930 
simple process but you can see me be
detailed<00:04:46.560> within<00:04:46.890> the<00:04:47.070> headphone<00:04:47.640> speaker

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
detailed within the headphone speaker

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.640 
detailed within the headphone speaker
itself<00:04:48.270> a<00:04:48.540> very<00:04:49.520> well<00:04:50.520> made<00:04:50.810> flush<00:04:51.810> design<00:04:52.290> and

00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:52.650 
itself a very well made flush design and

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.120 
itself a very well made flush design and
again<00:04:53.460> simple<00:04:53.940> we<00:04:54.150> just<00:04:54.330> put<00:04:54.630> this<00:04:54.780> back<00:04:55.130> done

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
again simple we just put this back done

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:58.460 
again simple we just put this back done
closed<00:04:56.550> now<00:04:57.210> these<00:04:57.390> are<00:04:57.600> noise<00:04:57.870> isolation

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
closed now these are noise isolation

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.920 
closed now these are noise isolation
headphones<00:04:59.040> and<00:04:59.940> what<00:05:00.090> that<00:05:00.240> means<00:05:00.480> that<00:05:00.630> once

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:00.930 
headphones and what that means that once

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.470 
headphones and what that means that once
you're<00:05:01.140> listening<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:01.800> music<00:05:02.030> it<00:05:03.030> basically

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:03.480 
you're listening to music it basically

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.240 
you're listening to music it basically
blocks<00:05:03.870> out<00:05:04.050> all<00:05:04.080> the<00:05:04.380> noise<00:05:04.560> around<00:05:04.770> you<00:05:05.130> so

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250
