it's<00:02:20.670> just<00:02:20.970> the<00:02:21.090> iphone<00:02:21.510> 5<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.319> cheap<00:02:22.650> case

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
it's just the iphone 5 in a cheap case

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.280 
it's just the iphone 5 in a cheap case
which<00:02:23.610> is<00:02:23.730> another<00:02:24.000> reason<00:02:24.120> in<00:02:24.599> it<00:02:24.750> and<00:02:25.140> they

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
which is another reason in it and they

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.199 
which is another reason in it and they
discontinued<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.040> iphone<00:02:26.489> 5<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.970> don't<00:02:27.120> know

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:31.670 
discontinued the iphone 5 I don't know
why<00:02:27.390> they<00:02:27.569> did<00:02:27.780> that<00:02:27.810> because<00:02:29.209> they<00:02:30.680> they

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
why they did that because they they

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.530 
why they did that because they they
should<00:02:31.709> have<00:02:32.010> took<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.340> iphone<00:02:32.730> 4s<00:02:33.090> off<00:02:33.329> to

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
should have took the iphone 4s off to

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.619 
should have took the iphone 4s off to
put<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.810> iphone<00:02:34.200> 5<00:02:34.470> they're<00:02:35.030> down<00:02:36.030> instead<00:02:36.569> of

00:02:36.619 --> 00:02:36.629 
put the iphone 5 they're down instead of

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:38.690 
put the iphone 5 they're down instead of
discontinuing<00:02:37.439> the<00:02:37.530> iphone<00:02:37.920> 5<00:02:38.129> I<00:02:38.430> don't<00:02:38.609> know

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
discontinuing the iphone 5 I don't know

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.860 
discontinuing the iphone 5 I don't know
why<00:02:38.849> I<00:02:38.879> did<00:02:39.209> that<00:02:39.239> but<00:02:40.079> now<00:02:40.319> the<00:02:40.769> iphone<00:02:41.220> 5

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
why I did that but now the iphone 5

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.349 
why I did that but now the iphone 5
equivalent<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.079> iphone<00:02:43.230> 5c<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.670> if<00:02:45.239> you

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
equivalent is the iphone 5c so if you

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:46.640 
equivalent is the iphone 5c so if you
wanted<00:02:45.629> to<00:02:45.720> get<00:02:45.840> something<00:02:46.049> like<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.349> iphone

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
wanted to get something like the iphone

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.319 
wanted to get something like the iphone
5<00:02:46.829> you<00:02:47.010> would<00:02:47.129> have<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.340> get<00:02:47.459> the<00:02:47.549> iphone<00:02:47.670> 5c

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
5 you would have to get the iphone 5c

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:49.520 
5 you would have to get the iphone 5c
unless<00:02:48.569> you<00:02:48.720> get<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:48.959> from<00:02:49.019> somewhere<00:02:49.109> like

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
unless you get it from somewhere like

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.830 
unless you get it from somewhere like
amazon<00:02:50.069> or<00:02:50.220> ebay<00:02:50.370> or<00:02:51.180> someone<00:02:51.450> else<00:02:51.629> that's

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
amazon or ebay or someone else that's

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.379 
amazon or ebay or someone else that's
selling<00:02:52.200> it<00:02:52.319> because<00:02:52.799> they<00:02:53.670> discontinued<00:02:54.359> it

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
selling it because they discontinued it

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.140 
selling it because they discontinued it
and<00:02:54.720> iphone<00:02:55.470> 5c<00:02:55.609> we<00:02:56.609> thought<00:02:56.819> was<00:02:56.909> going<00:02:57.000> to<00:02:57.090> be

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
and iphone 5c we thought was going to be

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.479 
and iphone 5c we thought was going to be
a<00:02:57.209> cheaper<00:02:57.599> version<00:02:57.629> of<00:02:58.260> an<00:02:58.829> iphone<00:02:59.189> which<00:02:59.340> is

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
a cheaper version of an iphone which is

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.240 
a cheaper version of an iphone which is
really<00:02:59.760> nice<00:03:00.030> it's<00:03:00.689> like<00:03:00.900> 120<00:03:01.680> dollars<00:03:02.010> less

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
really nice it's like 120 dollars less

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.960 
really nice it's like 120 dollars less
than<00:03:02.519> the<00:03:03.079> iphone<00:03:04.079> 5s<00:03:04.560> if<00:03:05.370> you're<00:03:05.579> getting<00:03:05.849> it

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
than the iphone 5s if you're getting it

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:07.640 
than the iphone 5s if you're getting it
unlocked<00:03:06.359> and<00:03:06.870> that's<00:03:07.019> another<00:03:07.290> reason<00:03:07.379> I

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
unlocked and that's another reason I

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:09.920 
unlocked and that's another reason I
always<00:03:07.799> get<00:03:08.159> my<00:03:08.220> phone<00:03:08.609> unlocked<00:03:09.299> because<00:03:09.540> I

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
always get my phone unlocked because I

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.520 
always get my phone unlocked because I
