have a problem with it all in fact I

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:18.480 
have a problem with it all in fact I
think<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.460> is<00:03:16.590> something<00:03:17.590> that<00:03:17.770> people<00:03:18.130> value

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
think it is something that people value

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.280 
think it is something that people value
and<00:03:18.970> care<00:03:19.180> about<00:03:19.300> very<00:03:19.660> deeply<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.110> they<00:03:20.230> do

and care about very deeply and they do

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.500 
and care about very deeply and they do
here<00:03:20.590> in<00:03:20.680> the<00:03:20.800> state<00:03:21.010> of<00:03:21.040> Pennsylvania<00:03:21.670> but

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
here in the state of Pennsylvania but

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.350 
here in the state of Pennsylvania but
there's<00:03:23.440> also<00:03:23.710> in<00:03:24.250> addition<00:03:24.490> to<00:03:24.850> that<00:03:24.970> reality

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
there's also in addition to that reality

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.480 
there's also in addition to that reality
the<00:03:26.050> other<00:03:26.230> reality<00:03:26.530> which<00:03:26.860> you<00:03:26.980> spoke<00:03:27.250> about

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:27.490 
the other reality which you spoke about

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:31.530 
the other reality which you spoke about
which<00:03:27.700> is<00:03:27.910> kids<00:03:28.830> getting<00:03:29.830> shot<00:03:29.860> or<00:03:30.540> shooting

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:31.540 
which is kids getting shot or shooting

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:34.470 
which is kids getting shot or shooting
each<00:03:31.660> other<00:03:32.490> because<00:03:33.490> of<00:03:33.520> illegal<00:03:33.940> handguns

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
each other because of illegal handguns

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.140 
each other because of illegal handguns
that<00:03:34.600> have<00:03:34.780> bended<00:03:34.990> up<00:03:35.110> on<00:03:35.260> the<00:03:35.410> streets<00:03:35.710> and<00:03:36.150> I

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
that have bended up on the streets and I

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.090 
that have bended up on the streets and I
just<00:03:37.630> think<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:37.960> we<00:03:38.140> should<00:03:38.560> be<00:03:38.710> able<00:03:38.950> to

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100 
just think that we should be able to

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.940 
just think that we should be able to
come<00:03:39.340> up<00:03:39.370> with<00:03:39.550> a<00:03:39.790> common-sense<00:03:40.360> approach

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
come up with a common-sense approach

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.100 
come up with a common-sense approach
that<00:03:41.950> preserves<00:03:42.400> those<00:03:42.670> traditions<00:03:43.270> of<00:03:43.420> gun

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
that preserves those traditions of gun

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.620 
that preserves those traditions of gun
ownership<00:03:44.410> but<00:03:44.770> also<00:03:45.190> deals<00:03:45.850> with<00:03:46.000> violence

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
ownership but also deals with violence

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.680 
ownership but also deals with violence
and<00:03:46.810> that<00:03:47.470> means<00:03:48.150> making<00:03:49.150> sure<00:03:49.330> that<00:03:49.510> our

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:49.690 
and that means making sure that our

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.050 
and that means making sure that our
background<00:03:49.900> checks<00:03:50.500> actually<00:03:50.710> work<00:03:51.280> they

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
background checks actually work they

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.420 
background checks actually work they
don't<00:03:52.300> right<00:03:52.570> now<00:03:52.780> the<00:03:53.140> way<00:03:53.290> they<00:03:53.470> should<00:03:53.530> so

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
don't right now the way they should so

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.540 
don't right now the way they should so
we've<00:03:55.360> seen<00:03:55.570> on<00:03:55.750> college<00:03:56.110> campuses<00:03:56.680> time<00:03:57.340> and

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.740 
the middle of urban communities and
we've<00:04:39.430> got<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.669> crack<00:04:39.850> down<00:04:39.880> on<00:04:40.120> some<00:04:40.510> of<00:04:40.630> it

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
we've got to crack down on some of it

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.830 
we've got to crack down on some of it
we've<00:04:41.140> got<00:04:41.290> to<00:04:41.380> close<00:04:41.890> the<00:04:42.160> gun<00:04:42.340> show<00:04:42.550> loophole

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
we've got to close the gun show loophole

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.940 
we've got to close the gun show loophole
which<00:04:43.840> allows<00:04:43.890> people

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
which allows people

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.830 
which allows people
to<00:04:45.040> sell<00:04:45.280> guns<00:04:45.550> at<00:04:45.880> gun<00:04:45.940> shows<00:04:46.240> without<00:04:46.810> a

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
to sell guns at gun shows without a

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:54.990 
to sell guns at gun shows without a
background<00:04:47.140> check<00:04:47.440> that's<00:04:48.220> a<00:04:48.430> problem<00:04:51.450> so<00:04:54.000> so

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
background check that's a problem so so

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.180 
background check that's a problem so so
I<00:04:55.030> think<00:04:55.390> there<00:04:55.540> are<00:04:55.570> a<00:04:55.750> number<00:04:55.870> of<00:04:56.290> common

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
I think there are a number of common

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:59.730 
I think there are a number of common
sense<00:04:57.700> gun<00:04:58.480> laws<00:04:58.750> that<00:04:59.050> we<00:04:59.170> can<00:04:59.320> put<00:04:59.500> in<00:04:59.590> place

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
sense gun laws that we can put in place

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.580 
sense gun laws that we can put in place
that<00:05:00.550> don't<00:05:00.850> contradict<00:05:01.600> the<00:05:02.230> Second

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590 
that don't contradict the Second

now<00:05:05.490> one<00:05:06.490> other<00:05:06.520> point<00:05:06.910> I<00:05:07.000> want<00:05:07.180> to<00:05:07.210> make

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
now one other point I want to make

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:13.560 
now one other point I want to make
though<00:05:07.570> and<00:05:07.780> that<00:05:07.980> is<00:05:08.980> that<00:05:10.950> we<00:05:11.950> have<00:05:12.220> to<00:05:12.570> also

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
though and that is that we have to also

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.810 
though and that is that we have to also
look<00:05:13.930> at<00:05:14.290> some<00:05:14.620> of<00:05:14.650> the<00:05:14.800> underlying<00:05:14.920> causes<00:05:15.340> of

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
look at some of the underlying causes of

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.430 
look at some of the underlying causes of
violence<00:05:16.480> particularly<00:05:16.900> in<00:05:17.110> urban

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
violence particularly in urban

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.200 
violence particularly in urban
communities<00:05:18.150> because<00:05:20.070> if<00:05:21.070> kids<00:05:21.490> start<00:05:22.090> off

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
communities because if kids start off

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.620

no father in the home then that creates

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.040 
no father in the home then that creates
an<00:05:38.200> atmosphere<00:05:39.100> in<00:05:39.310> which<00:05:40.230> violence<00:05:42.030> is

an atmosphere in which violence is

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.010 
an atmosphere in which violence is
starts<00:05:44.050> becoming<00:05:44.850> more<00:05:45.850> acceptable<00:05:46.330> it<00:05:46.570> seems

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
starts becoming more acceptable it seems

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:50.130 
starts becoming more acceptable it seems
normal<00:05:47.350> to<00:05:47.740> people<00:05:48.520> and<00:05:48.670> that<00:05:49.630> is<00:05:49.870> something

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.140 
normal to people and that is something

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.360 
normal to people and that is something
that<00:05:50.380> we're<00:05:50.470> going<00:05:50.500> to<00:05:50.620> have<00:05:50.800> to<00:05:50.920> change<00:05:51.160> we've

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
that we're going to have to change we've

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:52.800 
that we're going to have to change we've
got<00:05:51.520> to<00:05:51.610> transform<00:05:52.090> and<00:05:52.210> that's<00:05:52.330> why<00:05:52.480> it's<00:05:52.660> so

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:52.810 
got to transform and that's why it's so

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.510 
got to transform and that's why it's so
important<00:05:53.230> to<00:05:53.290> invest<00:05:53.680> in<00:05:53.950> early<00:05:54.370> childhood

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:54.520 
important to invest in early childhood

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:57.090 
important to invest in early childhood
education<00:05:55.030> to<00:05:55.990> close<00:05:56.260> the<00:05:56.440> achievement<00:05:56.530> gap

so<00:05:57.340> kids<00:05:57.640> are<00:05:57.790> ready<00:05:58.420> when<00:05:58.690> they<00:05:58.840> start<00:05:59.170> school

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
so kids are ready when they start school

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:07.140 
so kids are ready when they start school
it<00:06:01.810> means<00:06:04.050> it<00:06:05.050> means<00:06:05.430> after-school<00:06:06.430> programs

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.150
