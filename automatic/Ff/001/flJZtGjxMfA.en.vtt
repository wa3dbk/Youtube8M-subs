tapping<00:00:10.740> on<00:00:10.889> my<00:00:11.070> lathe<00:00:12.469> so<00:00:13.469> basically<00:00:13.860> what<00:00:14.070> I

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
tapping on my lathe so basically what I

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.640 
tapping on my lathe so basically what I
created<00:00:14.490> here<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:15.030> this<00:00:15.299> rotating<00:00:16.230> tapping

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
created here is this rotating tapping

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.150 
created here is this rotating tapping
jig<00:00:16.890> that<00:00:17.180> allows<00:00:18.180> me<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.480> put<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.289> tap<00:00:19.859> on<00:00:20.100> the

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
jig that allows me to put a tap on the

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.290 
jig that allows me to put a tap on the
end<00:00:20.460> in<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.260> half-inch<00:00:22.260> chuck<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.920> have<00:00:23.910> a

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
end in this half-inch chuck I have a

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.509 
end in this half-inch chuck I have a
handles<00:00:24.689> here<00:00:24.869> to<00:00:24.990> help<00:00:25.140> me<00:00:25.289> turn<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.980> jig<00:00:26.310> and

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
handles here to help me turn the jig and

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.419 
handles here to help me turn the jig and
it's<00:00:27.330> also<00:00:27.480> spring-loaded

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
it's also spring-loaded

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:31.820 
it's also spring-loaded
so<00:00:29.429> this<00:00:29.699> half<00:00:30.420> an<00:00:30.570> inch<00:00:30.750> shaft<00:00:31.050> steel<00:00:31.560> shaft

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
so this half an inch shaft steel shaft

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.910 
so this half an inch shaft steel shaft
slides<00:00:32.279> inside<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.329> it's<00:00:33.510> shocked<00:00:33.890> so<00:00:34.890> I

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
slides inside this one it's shocked so I

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.830 
slides inside this one it's shocked so I
made<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:35.190> so<00:00:35.489> this<00:00:35.760> these<00:00:36.090> handles<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.780> be

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
made it so this these handles can be

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.440 
made it so this these handles can be
removal<00:00:37.559> that<00:00:38.280> just<00:00:38.550> threaded<00:00:38.940> so<00:00:39.120> these<00:00:39.270> are

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
removal that just threaded so these are

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.260 
removal that just threaded so these are
this<00:00:39.750> is<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> stainless<00:00:40.350> steel<00:00:40.730> 5/16<00:00:41.730> bolt<00:00:42.000> and

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
this is a stainless steel 5/16 bolt and

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.630 
this is a stainless steel 5/16 bolt and
I've<00:00:43.079> turned<00:00:43.410> some<00:00:43.680> aluminum<00:00:44.100> handles<00:00:44.489> down

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
I've turned some aluminum handles down

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.709 
I've turned some aluminum handles down
for<00:00:45.000> it<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.270> so<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.469> be<00:00:46.530> removable<00:00:47.719> when

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
for it and so that can be removable when

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.090 
for it and so that can be removable when
you're<00:00:48.809> doing<00:00:48.989> different<00:00:49.410> types<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.710> tapping

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
you're doing different types of tapping

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.680 
you're doing different types of tapping
it<00:00:50.190> applications<00:00:50.910> so<00:00:51.090> that<00:00:51.120> comes<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.539> if<00:00:51.600> you

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
it applications so that comes you if you

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.709 
it applications so that comes you if you
screw<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.320> that<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:56.570> what<00:00:57.570> I'm<00:00:57.629> gonna

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
screw it in like that so what I'm gonna

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.750 
screw it in like that so what I'm gonna
do<00:00:57.899> here<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.410> I'm<00:00:58.590> going<00:00:58.800> to<00:00:58.859> demonstrate<00:00:59.129> how

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
do here is I'm going to demonstrate how

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.410 
do here is I'm going to demonstrate how
to<00:01:00.140> tap<00:01:01.140> this<00:01:01.410> really<00:01:01.770> quickly<00:01:02.160> using<00:01:02.940> a<00:01:03.210> very

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
to tap this really quickly using a very

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.980 
to tap this really quickly using a very
low<00:01:03.660> slow<00:01:04.379> speed<00:01:04.860> setting<00:01:05.280> 115<00:01:06.270> rpm<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.869> my

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
low slow speed setting 115 rpm on my

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.320 
low slow speed setting 115 rpm on my
lathe<00:01:07.200> here<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:08.130> already<00:01:08.280> pre<00:01:08.760> drilled<00:01:09.119> the

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
lathe here and I already pre drilled the

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.210 
lathe here and I already pre drilled the
hole<00:01:09.510> for<00:01:10.200> a<00:01:10.670> quarter<00:01:11.670> inch<00:01:11.850> by<00:01:12.119> 20<00:01:12.780> tap<00:01:13.220> so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
hole for a quarter inch by 20 tap so

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.210 
hole for a quarter inch by 20 tap so
I'll<00:01:14.310> just<00:01:14.520> Chuck<00:01:14.850> this<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.299> no<00:01:15.900> note<00:01:16.890> with<00:01:17.100> my

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
I'll just Chuck this in no note with my

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.770 
I'll just Chuck this in no note with my
safety<00:01:17.460> glasses<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:18.090> we'll<00:01:18.360> put<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> little<00:01:18.689> bit

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
safety glasses on we'll put a little bit

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.070 
safety glasses on we'll put a little bit
of<00:01:18.900> thread<00:01:19.110> cutter<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.650> here<00:01:20.689> and<00:01:21.689> what<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.020> do

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
of thread cutter on here and what I do

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.539 
of thread cutter on here and what I do
is<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.350> got<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.560> lathe<00:01:22.740> on<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> slower<00:01:23.250> setting

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
is I got the lathe on the slower setting

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.149 
is I got the lathe on the slower setting
I<00:01:23.880> got<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.390> forward<00:01:24.810> speed<00:01:25.140> since<00:01:26.009> it's

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
I got it on a forward speed since it's

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.679 
I got it on a forward speed since it's
spring-loaded<00:01:26.430> I'm<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.330> pull<00:01:27.570> it

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
spring-loaded I'm going just pull it

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:35.990 
spring-loaded I'm going just pull it
back<00:01:27.840> a<00:01:27.869> bit<00:01:28.200> turn<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.860> lathe<00:01:29.009> on

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.620 

when<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> feeling<00:01:36.720> catches<00:01:37.140> let<00:01:37.410> it<00:01:37.530> go<00:01:38.210> stop<00:01:39.210> it

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
when a feeling catches let it go stop it

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:48.290 
when a feeling catches let it go stop it
reverse<00:01:40.560> it<00:01:40.800> turn<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:41.730> on

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.350 

there<00:01:49.300> you<00:01:49.450> go<00:01:49.570> try<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.230> stopped<00:01:51.150> so<00:01:52.150> here's

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
there you go try it stopped so here's

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.530 
there you go try it stopped so here's
enough<00:01:52.690> close<00:01:52.960> view<00:01:53.860> of<00:01:53.890> my<00:01:54.790> tapping<00:01:56.070> Jake<00:01:57.540> see

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
enough close view of my tapping Jake see
