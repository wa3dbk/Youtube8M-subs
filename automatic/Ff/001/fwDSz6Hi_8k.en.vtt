00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
going on except a lot more

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.159 
going on except a lot more
straightforward

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:52.169 
straightforward

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:53.570 
straightforward
I<00:05:52.200> understand<00:05:52.740> they<00:05:52.860> didn't<00:05:53.099> have<00:05:53.250> the<00:05:53.370> same

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:53.580 
I understand they didn't have the same

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.460 
I understand they didn't have the same
technology<00:05:54.300> and<00:05:54.419> didn't<00:05:54.720> wanna<00:05:54.900> you<00:05:55.320> know

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
technology and didn't wanna you know

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.650 
technology and didn't wanna you know
share<00:05:55.830> play<00:05:56.039> over<00:05:56.430> the<00:05:56.550> internet<00:05:57.060> they<00:05:57.330> wanted

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
share play over the internet they wanted

00:05:57.660 --> 00:05:59.180 
share play over the internet they wanted
to<00:05:57.750> basically<00:05:57.930> give<00:05:58.349> that<00:05:58.560> game<00:05:58.770> out<00:05:59.010> to<00:05:59.160> a

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
to basically give that game out to a

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:00.920 
to basically give that game out to a
person<00:05:59.520> and<00:06:00.000> then<00:06:00.180> they<00:06:00.270> could<00:06:00.450> download<00:06:00.599> it

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:00.930 
person and then they could download it

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:02.360 
person and then they could download it
to<00:06:01.050> their<00:06:01.169> system<00:06:01.560> and<00:06:01.680> they<00:06:01.830> could<00:06:02.039> play<00:06:02.220> it

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:02.370 
to their system and they could play it

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.159 
to their system and they could play it
and<00:06:02.460> they<00:06:02.700> needed<00:06:03.000> a<00:06:03.090> form<00:06:03.330> of<00:06:03.450> DRM<00:06:03.870> so<00:06:04.050> they

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
and they needed a form of DRM so they

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:05.779 
and they needed a form of DRM so they
could<00:06:04.320> basically<00:06:04.440> control<00:06:05.160> that<00:06:05.430> but<00:06:05.639> this

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:05.789 
could basically control that but this

00:06:05.789 --> 00:06:07.250 
could basically control that but this
just<00:06:06.030> seems<00:06:06.090> like<00:06:06.330> a<00:06:06.450> little<00:06:06.720> bit<00:06:06.900> more<00:06:07.080> of<00:06:07.169> a

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
just seems like a little bit more of a

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260 
just seems like a little bit more of a
straightforward<00:06:07.620> option<00:06:08.550> to<00:06:08.729> sharing<00:06:09.150> your

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
straightforward option to sharing your

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
this feature than you did before because

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.770 
this feature than you did before because
it<00:06:14.310> seemed<00:06:14.550> to<00:06:14.639> me<00:06:14.880> on<00:06:15.060> the<00:06:15.180> internet<00:06:15.630> that

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 
it seemed to me on the internet that

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:17.300 
it seemed to me on the internet that
people<00:06:16.080> didn't<00:06:16.380> really<00:06:16.440> know<00:06:16.680> how<00:06:17.010> it<00:06:17.099> worked

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
people didn't really know how it worked

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:18.830 
people didn't really know how it worked
they<00:06:17.700> thought<00:06:17.910> that<00:06:18.030> you<00:06:18.090> could<00:06:18.330> only<00:06:18.539> give

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
they thought that you could only give

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.510 
they thought that you could only give
your<00:06:19.020> game<00:06:19.229> to<00:06:19.440> somebody<00:06:19.770> else<00:06:19.979> to<00:06:20.130> play<00:06:20.310> and

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
your game to somebody else to play and

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.560 
your game to somebody else to play and
then<00:06:20.820> you<00:06:20.970> were<00:06:21.060> just<00:06:21.270> sitting<00:06:21.450> there

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:21.570 
then you were just sitting there

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:22.879 
then you were just sitting there
twiddling<00:06:22.080> your<00:06:22.289> thumbs

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
twiddling your thumbs
