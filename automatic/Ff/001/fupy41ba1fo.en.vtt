the plant along with the animation that
we<00:00:34.710> just<00:00:34.890> created<00:00:35.600> now<00:00:36.600> let's<00:00:36.809> create<00:00:36.989> a

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
we just created now let's create a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.810 
we just created now let's create a
simple<00:00:37.320> terrain<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:37.980> use<00:00:38.160> as<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.550> base<00:00:38.790> for

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
simple terrain to use as the base for

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.200 
simple terrain to use as the base for
our<00:00:39.600> animated<00:00:40.230> ecosystem<00:00:40.950> in<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.730> material

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
our animated ecosystem in the material

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.760 
our animated ecosystem in the material
editor<00:00:42.360> we've<00:00:42.750> set<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> material<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:43.649> an

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
editor we've set the material as an

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.500 
editor we've set the material as an
ecosystem<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.579> then<00:00:44.820> load<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.300> our

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
ecosystem and then load in our

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.950 
ecosystem and then load in our
previously<00:00:46.410> created<00:00:46.649> bamboo<00:00:47.219> object<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:48.719> set

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
previously created bamboo object we set

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.350 
previously created bamboo object we set
the<00:00:49.079> maximum<00:00:49.469> instance<00:00:50.070> rotation<00:00:50.610> 20<00:00:51.000> degrees

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
the maximum instance rotation 20 degrees

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.510 
the maximum instance rotation 20 degrees
so<00:00:51.989> that<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.320> of<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.620> instances<00:00:52.980> remain

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
so that all of the instances remain

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.700 
so that all of the instances remain
aligned<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.120> then<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:55.050> populate<00:00:55.590> the

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
aligned and then we populate the

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.670 
aligned and then we populate the
ecosystem<00:00:56.390> now<00:00:57.390> let's<00:00:57.600> create<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:57.960> short<00:00:58.379> 10

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
ecosystem now let's create a short 10

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.060 
ecosystem now let's create a short 10
second<00:00:59.100> animation<00:00:59.600> open<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> timeline<00:01:01.230> set

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
second animation open the timeline set

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.750 
second animation open the timeline set
the<00:01:02.190> animation<00:01:02.340> length<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.270> render<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:05.580> can

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the animation length and render you can

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.370 
the animation length and render you can
see<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.360> animation<00:01:06.900> doesn't<00:01:07.229> look<00:01:07.350> very

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
see that the animation doesn't look very

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.770 
see that the animation doesn't look very
realistic<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.240> where<00:01:09.390> equal

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
realistic and here is where equal

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.469 
realistic and here is where equal
phasing<00:01:10.140> comes<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.680> rescue<00:01:11.090> we<00:01:12.090> go<00:01:12.270> back

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
phasing comes to the rescue we go back

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.359 
phasing comes to the rescue we go back
into<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.810> ecosystem<00:01:13.110> material<00:01:13.890> editor<00:01:14.010> and

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
into the ecosystem material editor and

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.789 
into the ecosystem material editor and
under<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.880> animation<00:01:15.390> tab<00:01:15.600> we<00:01:16.229> are<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.560> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
under the animation tab we are going to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.700 
under the animation tab we are going to
use<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> variable<00:01:17.460> time<00:01:17.820> offset<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:19.290> offset

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
use a variable time offset the offset

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.679 
use a variable time offset the offset
will<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:19.979> driven<00:01:20.159> by<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> function<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.090> this

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
will be driven by a function in this

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.260 
will be driven by a function in this
case<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.619> will<00:01:22.740> load<00:01:23.009> in<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.310> gradient<00:01:23.790> map<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
case we will load in a gradient map to

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.170 
case we will load in a gradient map to
create<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> wind<00:01:24.930> wave<00:01:25.200> effect<00:01:25.640> we<00:01:26.640> then<00:01:26.880> set

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
create a wind wave effect we then set

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.330 
create a wind wave effect we then set
the<00:01:27.299> time<00:01:27.509> offset<00:01:27.990> range<00:01:28.229> which<00:01:28.829> indicates

each instance can have per frame now we

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.280 
each instance can have per frame now we
populate<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.920> ecosystem<00:01:44.579> and<00:01:44.729> re-render

populate the ecosystem and re-render

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.749 
populate the ecosystem and re-render
notice<00:01:46.290> how<00:01:46.409> much<00:01:46.560> more<00:01:46.799> natural-looking<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
notice how much more natural-looking the

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.020 
notice how much more natural-looking the
animation<00:01:48.240> appears<00:01:49.430> you<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.640> use<00:01:50.850> the

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
animation appears you can use the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.450 
animation appears you can use the
ecosystem<00:01:51.689> animation<00:01:52.320> phasing<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.159> achieve<00:01:53.430> a

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
ecosystem animation phasing to achieve a

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.370 
ecosystem animation phasing to achieve a
variety<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.149> natural-looking<00:01:54.780> movements

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
