00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:21.489 
on the fjords on a tank company battle
and<00:01:20.569> obviously<00:01:20.810> being<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.079> tank<00:01:21.289> company

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
and obviously being a tank company

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:23.469 
and obviously being a tank company
battle<00:01:21.920> there<00:01:22.100> are<00:01:22.280> slightly<00:01:22.700> higher<00:01:22.880> stick

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
battle there are slightly higher stick

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:24.879 
battle there are slightly higher stick
so<00:01:23.719> what<00:01:23.869> he's<00:01:23.960> doing<00:01:24.229> here<00:01:24.409> is<00:01:24.530> he's<00:01:24.649> there

00:01:24.879 --> 00:01:24.889 
so what he's doing here is he's there

00:01:24.889 --> 00:01:26.949 
so what he's doing here is he's there
keeping<00:01:25.700> his<00:01:25.789> mouse<00:01:25.999> cursor<00:01:26.299> in<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.659> area

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:26.959 
keeping his mouse cursor in the area

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:28.239 
keeping his mouse cursor in the area
where<00:01:27.170> he<00:01:27.350> knows<00:01:27.619> that<00:01:27.859> the<00:01:27.979> enemy's

00:01:28.239 --> 00:01:28.249 
where he knows that the enemy's

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:30.039 
where he knows that the enemy's
artillery<00:01:28.459> is<00:01:28.880> more<00:01:29.149> slightly<00:01:29.509> to<00:01:29.630> be<00:01:29.749> because

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:30.049 
artillery is more slightly to be because

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:31.270 
artillery is more slightly to be because
that's<00:01:30.200> probably<00:01:30.469> where<00:01:30.649> he's<00:01:30.859> most<00:01:30.889> likely

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
that's probably where he's most likely

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.639 
that's probably where he's most likely
to<00:01:31.579> be<00:01:31.729> and<00:01:31.969> if<00:01:32.389> you<00:01:32.509> notice<00:01:32.719> just<00:01:33.139> about<00:01:33.439> now

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
to be and if you notice just about now

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.559 
to be and if you notice just about now
spots<00:01:34.069> that<00:01:34.310> tree<00:01:34.639> falling<00:01:35.090> there<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:35.479> it

00:01:35.559 --> 00:01:35.569 
spots that tree falling there so it

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.480 
spots that tree falling there so it
takes<00:01:35.749> his<00:01:35.990> shot<00:01:37.149> and<00:01:38.619> boom<00:01:39.619> manages<00:01:40.189> to<00:01:40.279> take

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
takes his shot and boom manages to take

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.789 
takes his shot and boom manages to take
out<00:01:40.729> the<00:01:40.969> only<00:01:41.179> enemy<00:01:41.719> artillery<00:01:42.380> there<00:01:42.709> as

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:45.079 
you can see not even set up as he's

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:47.230 
you can see not even set up as he's
still<00:01:45.350> facing<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.920> wrong<00:01:46.159> direction<00:01:46.429> he

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
still facing the wrong direction he

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.749

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
wasn't even properly in position so

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.910
