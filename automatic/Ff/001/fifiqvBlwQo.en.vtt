00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:14.719
 4 Europe as the world center of Austria Vienna classical music 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.139
 To talk about this city, which is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site , separate from the classic tradition 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:21.119
 You can not 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.509
 From Baja to Beethoven to Schubert and Brahms to the capital Leo 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:23.509
 Political party 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:33.920
 One waterfall was born more than 175 years ago 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:37.790
 Overwriting is the sound of the parts themselves and maximizes the possibility of interpreting the performance of pianists since then 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.530
 Attracted attention from all over the world for being imposed on 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.530
 That was the piano of Basendorfer 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.440
 me 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.050
 Hmm 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.829
 BÃ¶sendorfer instruments are manufactured by hand in the town say and point b 7 light brown 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:58.010
 I will 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:01:03.450
 A 5-year-long bed of wood waterfall felled during the winter on a land of 1500 square meters long 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:07.620
 You need adequate moisture and good quality to make a good sound 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:12.490
 At the Basendolfer factory, first outdoors to dry the fire 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:15.590
 And I will continue to get two steps to keep my mind indoors 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:21.350
 This can only be seen here in the world 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:25.030
 Each one is of high quality and also has its own uniqueness and unique characteristics of Basendorfer 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.030
 Is a necessary condition 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:35.260
 For the production of Gessen Doller who should be called Rolls-Royce of the world's room 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:40.420
 100 work processes are required for the piano of the times 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:44.630
 The frameworks of the heavy things that fix the hearing of the 10 are also all different one by one 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:48.549
 The data country will also be polished manually and finished by hand 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.549
 And will be adjusted correctly 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.430
 One one one one one one 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.000
 me 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.000
 me 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.530
 me 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:08.000
 me 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:14.230
 Each one has its own product version and can be compared with the production record of its piano, so 100 years 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.230
 Even after the production method and style even its origin is understood exactly 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.090
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:18.090
 Hmm 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.490
 Hmm 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:36.189
 One of the secrets of the Basendor piano is in the processing of the alleged part 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:41.579
 We will continue to make the shape of the night go bent by hand wood itself use a special technique 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:41.579
 The ideal resonance of natural materials is maintained from 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.260
 Hmm 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.290
 Yes Yes Yes Yes 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:57.290
 Hmm 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:06.110
 9 minutes 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.110
 This is the perfect handiwork to make the piece 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.000
 There Yes 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 Hmm 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.760
 Hmm 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:16.560
 Hmm 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.560
 Hmm 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.480
 Hmm 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:35.010
 The center of the piano It is the main part of the grand piano born in the house in Kyoto 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:38.069
 There is also a difference in the length of collusion . These have a special curve and this is against decompression 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.790
 We have created a reverse pressure required Te 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:40.790
 me 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:50.110
 Strings will be attached to each other and will be attached independently. 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:51.420
 This is a big feature of this instrument 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.260
 Hmm 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.260
 me 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.440
 These are made in Basendolfer's own current plant 

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.600
 w 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.180
 uh 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:25.850
 Hmm 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.880
 me 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.880
 rar 

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:51.480
 The mechanical structure of the Basendorfer has defined a new standard 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.600
 It means that any request of the performer can be met 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:05:00.380
 This structure is the accuracy and repetition of the sound 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.380
 It is worth noting that it enables perfect performance 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:11.469
 It is a stepping scene of a structure part 

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:13.619
 Advanced manual ability of human beings that exist in the production process together with the instrument has a very important meaning 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:13.619
 I will 

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:25.750
 This work is determined by carefulness and careful attention to detail This is a high musical 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.750
 It becomes a factor to acquire the result 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:50.279
 The people who work at the Prime Minister Dolfer 

00:05:42.159 --> 00:05:50.279
 They are artists, not craftsmen, even with modern tools and the latest technology 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:10.569
 Since the pottery 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:15.509
 Special models and limited items made of very expensive materials have also been made in addition to mud instruments 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:15.509
 These have been legendaryly told 

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.780
 We will finally get to the finishing stage 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:49.099
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:06:56.129 --> 00:07:02.960
 The adjustment is done by treating the fan well head here to give the ideal tone that the instrument has 

00:07:02.159 --> 00:07:08.630
 Will be 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:11.800
 Thus, every Basendolfer piano is a huge key made by a master craftsman 

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.800
 It will be the piano of 

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:38.970
 Innovation and constant improvement are advanced 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:38.970
 It is a necessary condition to lead further development and sensibility
