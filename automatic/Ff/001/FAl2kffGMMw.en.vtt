so I'm gonna stick with the xbox one for
that<00:02:02.360> reason<00:02:02.540> that's<00:02:02.750> probably<00:02:02.960> the<00:02:03.050> number

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
that reason that's probably the number

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:05.680 
that reason that's probably the number
one<00:02:03.290> reason<00:02:03.700> another<00:02:04.700> reason<00:02:04.909> i<00:02:05.180> love<00:02:05.240> the

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690

people<00:02:08.479> for<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.869> ps3<00:02:09.140> controller<00:02:09.619> I've

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
people for the ps3 controller I've

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.160 
people for the ps3 controller I've
always<00:02:10.250> hated<00:02:10.819> the<00:02:11.090> ps3<00:02:11.510> controller<00:02:11.870> feels

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
always hated the ps3 controller feels

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.380 
always hated the ps3 controller feels
tiny<00:02:12.409> in<00:02:12.590> my<00:02:12.709> hands<00:02:13.099> will<00:02:13.640> always<00:02:14.030> love<00:02:14.269> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
tiny in my hands will always love the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.330 
tiny in my hands will always love the
xbox<00:02:14.750> controller<00:02:15.170> yes<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.069> going<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.250> be<00:02:16.310> a

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
xbox controller yes it's going to be a

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.500 
xbox controller yes it's going to be a
little<00:02:16.550> bit<00:02:16.640> different<00:02:17.000> for<00:02:17.090> the<00:02:17.180> new<00:02:17.270> system

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
little bit different for the new system

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.760 
little bit different for the new system
but<00:02:17.930> I'm<00:02:18.020> guessing<00:02:18.140> it's<00:02:18.380> going<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.560> be<00:02:18.650> pretty

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
but I'm guessing it's going to be pretty

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:19.930 
but I'm guessing it's going to be pretty
close<00:02:19.040> from<00:02:19.280> everything<00:02:19.520> I've<00:02:19.670> read

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
close from everything I've read

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.340 
close from everything I've read
and<00:02:20.030> so<00:02:20.180> I'm<00:02:20.300> gonna<00:02:20.390> stick<00:02:20.660> with<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.870> xbox<00:02:21.170> for

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
and so I'm gonna stick with the xbox for

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.440 
and so I'm gonna stick with the xbox for
that<00:02:21.440> reason<00:02:21.590> as<00:02:21.770> well<00:02:21.800> I<00:02:22.160> also<00:02:22.610> love<00:02:22.880> the<00:02:23.030> Xbox

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
that reason as well I also love the Xbox

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.540 
that reason as well I also love the Xbox

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.220 
subscribers in any easy way there's just
a<00:02:40.460> lot<00:02:40.610> of<00:02:40.670> reasons<00:02:41.090> that<00:02:41.210> the<00:02:41.360> ps3<00:02:41.900> system

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
a lot of reasons that the ps3 system

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.600 
a lot of reasons that the ps3 system
kind<00:02:42.560> of<00:02:42.620> sucked<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.010> it<00:02:43.100> didn't<00:02:43.280> have<00:02:43.370> party

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610

kind of sucked and it didn't have party
chat<00:02:43.820> now<00:02:43.940> maybe<00:02:44.120> they're<00:02:44.270> fixing<00:02:44.570> some<00:02:44.750> of

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
chat now maybe they're fixing some of

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.600 
chat now maybe they're fixing some of
that<00:02:44.960> but<00:02:45.440> even<00:02:45.650> still<00:02:45.770> just<00:02:46.070> doesn't<00:02:46.460> seem

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
that but even still just doesn't seem

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.180 
that but even still just doesn't seem
worth<00:02:46.640> it<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.030> me<00:02:47.150> the<00:02:47.630> last<00:02:47.930> reason<00:02:48.290> there's

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
worth it to me the last reason there's

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.550 
worth it to me the last reason there's
only<00:02:49.370> one<00:02:49.850> game<00:02:50.390> other<00:02:50.690> than<00:02:50.780> cod<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.440> I'm

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:48.110 
gonna be a better system honestly if it

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.780 
gonna be a better system honestly if it
goes<00:04:48.230> the<00:04:48.260> way<00:04:48.440> this<00:04:48.710> last<00:04:49.010> few<00:04:49.220> systems<00:04:49.370> went

guys<00:04:59.180> it<00:04:59.780> is<00:04:59.900> so<00:05:00.170> close<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:00.650> at<00:05:00.740> this<00:05:00.860> point<00:05:01.040> I

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
guys it is so close and at this point I

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.040 
guys it is so close and at this point I
didn't<00:05:01.550> know<00:05:01.670> if<00:05:01.910> we<00:05:02.060> had<00:05:02.090> enough<00:05:02.480> time<00:05:02.780> or<00:05:02.960> not

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
didn't know if we had enough time or not

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.690

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
so I was just kind of praying hoping

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.640 
so I was just kind of praying hoping
that<00:05:04.970> we'd<00:05:05.090> at<00:05:05.210> least<00:05:05.240> get<00:05:05.540> a<00:05:05.570> tie<00:05:05.870> but<00:05:06.410> as<00:05:06.530> you

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
that we'd at least get a tie but as you

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.290 
that we'd at least get a tie but as you
can<00:05:06.710> see<00:05:06.890> we're<00:05:07.040> about<00:05:07.310> to<00:05:07.610> take<00:05:07.880> the<00:05:08.060> lead

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300
