hypothetical<00:03:15.989> world<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:16.739> team<00:03:16.919> says<00:03:17.189> would

hypothetical world the team says would

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.610 
hypothetical world the team says would
be<00:03:17.459> about<00:03:17.609> 200<00:03:18.239> au<00:03:18.389> from<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.840> Sun<00:03:19.079> and<00:03:19.229> would

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
be about 200 au from the Sun and would

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.379 
be about 200 au from the Sun and would
have<00:03:19.769> a<00:03:19.799> mass<00:03:20.040> bigger<00:03:20.370> than<00:03:20.609> Mars<00:03:20.849> but<00:03:21.120> less

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
have a mass bigger than Mars but less

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:23.449 
have a mass bigger than Mars but less
than<00:03:21.419> Saturn<00:03:22.049> so<00:03:22.290> if<00:03:22.379> the<00:03:22.500> math<00:03:22.680> is<00:03:22.889> suggesting

our<00:03:51.389> solar<00:03:51.689> system<00:03:52.199> so<00:03:52.409> the<00:03:52.530> hope<00:03:52.680> is<00:03:52.859> that<00:03:52.919> if

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
our solar system so the hope is that if

our solar system so the hope is that if
there<00:03:53.430> are<00:03:53.459> any<00:03:53.819> more<00:03:54.060> planets<00:03:54.449> out<00:03:54.599> there<00:03:54.629> to

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
there are any more planets out there to

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:56.960 
there are any more planets out there to
be<00:03:54.989> found<00:03:55.199> this<00:03:55.769> telescope<00:03:56.340> will<00:03:56.370> find<00:03:56.790> them

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
be found this telescope will find them

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.460 
be found this telescope will find them
so<00:03:57.209> for<00:03:57.389> all<00:03:57.479> you<00:03:57.599> people<00:03:57.810> who<00:03:58.079> were<00:03:58.199> raised

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
so for all you people who were raised

00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.749 
so for all you people who were raised
thinking<00:03:58.859> there<00:03:59.009> are<00:03:59.099> nine<00:03:59.220> planets<00:03:59.430> in<00:03:59.699> the

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
solar system maybe you were right maybe

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.589 
solar system maybe you were right maybe
there<00:04:01.889> were<00:04:02.009> more<00:04:02.189> than<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.549> who<00:04:02.970> knows<00:04:03.209> what

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
there were more than that who knows what
