here<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.580> has<00:03:40.610> its<00:03:40.970> spring<00:03:41.360> in<00:03:41.690> this<00:03:41.930> tab<00:03:42.170> which

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
here it has its spring in this tab which

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:44.199 
here it has its spring in this tab which
bolts<00:03:42.739> underneath<00:03:42.950> this<00:03:43.190> plate<00:03:43.430> yeah<00:03:43.910> this<00:03:44.120> is

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:44.209 
bolts underneath this plate yeah this is

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.630 
bolts underneath this plate yeah this is
also<00:03:44.360> my<00:03:44.690> kind<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.079> system<00:03:45.709> here<00:03:45.860> requires<00:03:46.340> no

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:46.640 
also my kind of system here requires no

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.940 
also my kind of system here requires no
drilling<00:03:46.880> no<00:03:47.150> welding<00:03:47.690> it<00:03:48.049> just<00:03:48.290> clips<00:03:48.560> on<00:03:48.739> and

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
drilling no welding it just clips on and

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.380 
drilling no welding it just clips on and
then<00:03:49.040> once<00:03:49.220> it's<00:03:49.400> on<00:03:49.579> it<00:03:49.970> actually<00:03:50.150> is

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
then once it's on it actually is

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:52.300 
then once it's on it actually is
retained<00:03:50.720> there<00:03:50.900> by<00:03:51.019> its<00:03:51.200> own<00:03:51.320> tension<00:03:51.799> right

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
retained there by its own tension right

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.620 
retained there by its own tension right
you<00:03:52.400> don't<00:03:52.519> to<00:03:52.640> modify<00:03:53.030> anything<00:03:53.329> and<00:03:53.450> you<00:03:53.510> can

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:53.630 
you don't to modify anything and you can

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:54.729 
you don't to modify anything and you can
see<00:03:53.750> right<00:03:53.930> here<00:03:53.959> we've<00:03:54.200> got<00:03:54.230> two<00:03:54.440> pivot

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:54.739 
see right here we've got two pivot

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:56.620 
see right here we've got two pivot
points<00:03:55.010> so<00:03:55.459> it's<00:03:55.579> constantly<00:03:56.030> self<00:03:56.329> aligning

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
points so it's constantly self aligning

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.360 
points so it's constantly self aligning
with<00:03:56.870> the<00:03:56.959> spring<00:03:57.260> works<00:03:58.040> in<00:03:58.160> conjunction

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
with the spring works in conjunction

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:00.430 
with the spring works in conjunction
with<00:03:58.760> and<00:03:59.150> reduces<00:03:59.570> shot<00:03:59.810> to<00:03:59.989> your<00:04:00.110> spring<00:04:00.320> in

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
with and reduces shot to your spring in

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.960 
with and reduces shot to your spring in
fact<00:04:00.620> when<00:04:00.739> the<00:04:00.799> trucks<00:04:01.040> empty<00:04:01.340> this<00:04:01.790> will

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
fact when the trucks empty this will

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:04.120 
fact when the trucks empty this will
reduce<00:04:02.090> wheel<00:04:02.540> hop<00:04:02.780> it'll<00:04:03.290> reduce<00:04:03.500> axle<00:04:03.950> wrap

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:04.130 
reduce wheel hop it'll reduce axle wrap

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:05.530 
reduce wheel hop it'll reduce axle wrap
and<00:04:04.370> actually<00:04:04.790> make<00:04:04.910> the<00:04:05.030> vehicle<00:04:05.180> ride

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
and actually make the vehicle ride

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.970 
and actually make the vehicle ride
better<00:04:05.780> when<00:04:05.959> it's<00:04:06.079> empty<00:04:06.230> that's<00:04:06.650> right<00:04:06.860> and

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
better when it's empty that's right and

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.170 
better when it's empty that's right and
you<00:04:07.040> can<00:04:07.160> always<00:04:07.489> you<00:04:07.670> know<00:04:07.730> beef<00:04:07.970> up<00:04:08.150> your

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
you can always you know beef up your

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.699 
you can always you know beef up your

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
to lean left that means I'm actually

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.930
