was him I would have never done that

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.740 
was him I would have never done that
because<00:00:56.129> obviously<00:00:56.789> all<00:00:57.270> he<00:00:57.390> has<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.510> do<00:00:57.629> is

glitch with an MSM see up close but my

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.080 
glitch with an MSM see up close but my
partner<00:01:05.010> did<00:01:05.250> not<00:01:05.369> expect<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:06.060> happen

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
partner did not expect that to happen

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.330 
partner did not expect that to happen
and<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:07.020> didn't<00:01:07.290> expect<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.680> dab<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.130> so

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
and I didn't expect that dab and so

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.670 
and I didn't expect that dab and so
ended<00:01:08.909> up<00:01:09.060> rushing<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.450> right<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:09.689> no<00:01:09.750> one<00:01:10.110> now

let<00:01:11.040> me<00:01:11.070> tell<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.430> that<00:01:11.460> last<00:01:12.420> map<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.860> hate

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
let me tell you that last map I do hate

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.190 
let me tell you that last map I do hate
being<00:01:14.460> down<00:01:14.640> at<00:01:14.820> any<00:01:15.000> point<00:01:15.299> and<00:01:15.600> especially

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
being down at any point and especially

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.719 
being down at any point and especially
when<00:01:16.439> we're<00:01:16.560> done<00:01:16.650> 01<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.159> know<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.430> first

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
when we're done 01 you know that first

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.609 
when we're done 01 you know that first
round<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.150> always<00:01:18.420> crucial<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:18.990> if<00:01:19.350> it

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
round is always crucial because if it

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.990 
round is always crucial because if it
has<00:01:19.770> been<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:20.009> good<00:01:20.130> match<00:01:20.310> chances<00:01:20.729> are<00:01:20.850> it's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
has been a good match chances are it's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.330 
has been a good match chances are it's
going<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.180> go<00:01:21.270> 33<00:01:21.659> so<00:01:22.200> here<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.409> do<00:01:22.530> expect<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.189> be

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
going to go 33 so here I do expect to be

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.670 
going to go 33 so here I do expect to be
rush<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.820> I<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.180> see<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.630> new<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.350> pick

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
rush and I do see one new here so I pick

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.320 
rush and I do see one new here so I pick
him<00:01:25.799> off<00:01:25.950> and<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:26.729> I<00:01:26.820> should<00:01:26.970> have<00:01:27.060> gone<00:01:27.180> for

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
throws innate so I figure he's either

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
especially if that was me on defense in

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.200 
especially if that was me on defense in
a<00:02:43.990> 1v1<00:02:44.380> i'd<00:02:44.950> be<00:02:45.190> camping<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.640> corner<00:02:45.970> but<00:02:46.120> it

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
a 1v1 i'd be camping a corner but it

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.730 
a 1v1 i'd be camping a corner but it
turns<00:02:46.390> out<00:02:46.540> he<00:02:46.690> wasn't<00:02:46.870> gambling<00:02:47.230> a<00:02:47.380> corner<00:02:47.650> he

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
turns out he wasn't gambling a corner he

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.990 
turns out he wasn't gambling a corner he
was<00:02:47.860> just<00:02:47.980> running<00:02:48.100> around<00:02:48.310> so<00:02:48.520> I<00:02:48.580> check<00:02:48.790> every

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
was just running around so I check every

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.430 
was just running around so I check every
single<00:02:49.510> little<00:02:49.630> one<00:02:49.840> of<00:02:49.960> these<00:02:50.050> corners

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
single little one of these corners

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.140 
single little one of these corners
because<00:02:50.980> most<00:02:51.340> of<00:02:51.430> the<00:02:51.520> people<00:02:51.580> i<00:02:51.910> play

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
because most of the people i play

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.120 
because most of the people i play
especially<00:02:52.420> on<00:02:52.750> right<00:02:52.900> on<00:02:53.020> defense<00:02:53.440> they'll

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
especially on right on defense they'll

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.280 
especially on right on defense they'll
be<00:02:54.280> capping<00:02:54.700> a<00:02:54.760> corner<00:02:55.120> in<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.240> 1v1<00:02:55.570> or<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.900> 1v2

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
be capping a corner in a 1v1 or a 1v2

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.140 
be capping a corner in a 1v1 or a 1v2
just<00:02:56.680> waiting<00:02:56.920> for<00:02:57.100> me<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.220> make<00:02:57.490> my<00:02:57.700> move<00:02:57.730> pick

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
just waiting for me to make my move pick

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.540 
just waiting for me to make my move pick
up<00:02:58.270> the<00:02:58.390> mom<00:02:58.570> and<00:02:58.600> planet<00:02:59.140> so<00:02:59.950> I<00:02:59.980> do<00:03:00.250> decide

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
up the mom and planet so I do decide

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.730 
up the mom and planet so I do decide
that<00:03:01.030> you<00:03:01.570> know<00:03:01.720> since<00:03:01.960> I'm<00:03:02.200> thinking<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.710> my

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
that you know since I'm thinking in my

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.230 
that you know since I'm thinking in my
head<00:03:02.860> right<00:03:03.010> now<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.550> he<00:03:03.730> definitely<00:03:03.940> knows

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:04.240 
head right now that he definitely knows

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.690 
head right now that he definitely knows
bombs<00:03:04.540> down<00:03:05.040> because<00:03:06.040> his<00:03:06.190> partner<00:03:06.550> probably

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
bombs down because his partner probably

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.490 
bombs down because his partner probably
called<00:03:07.030> that<00:03:07.180> out<00:03:07.360> maybe<00:03:07.660> he<00:03:07.930> saw<00:03:08.170> him<00:03:08.320> from

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:08.500 
called that out maybe he saw him from

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.920 
called that out maybe he saw him from
the<00:03:08.560> other<00:03:08.770> side<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.700> middle<00:03:10.090> because<00:03:10.570> the

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:10.930 
the other side of middle because the

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.480 
the other side of middle because the
bomb<00:03:11.080> is<00:03:11.290> visible<00:03:11.800> in<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.950> middle<00:03:12.160> here<00:03:12.310> so

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
bomb is visible in the middle here so

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.860 
bomb is visible in the middle here so
I'm<00:03:12.550> thinking<00:03:12.880> maybe<00:03:13.000> he's<00:03:13.240> camping<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.600> corner

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
I'm thinking maybe he's camping a corner

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.900 
I'm thinking maybe he's camping a corner
in<00:03:13.900> mid<00:03:14.170> that's<00:03:15.010> what<00:03:15.220> my<00:03:15.310> partner's<00:03:15.670> telling

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
in mid that's what my partner's telling

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.190 
in mid that's what my partner's telling
me<00:03:16.000> as<00:03:16.090> well<00:03:16.270> so<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.450> decide<00:03:16.690> my<00:03:16.780> list<00:03:16.990> of<00:03:17.080> my

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
me as well so I decide my list of my

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.690 
me as well so I decide my list of my
partner<00:03:17.530> and<00:03:17.590> check<00:03:17.770> every<00:03:18.100> single<00:03:18.400> corner<00:03:18.550> in

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
partner and check every single corner in

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:20.910 
partner and check every single corner in
middle<00:03:18.910> turns<00:03:19.240> out<00:03:19.330> he's<00:03:19.540> not<00:03:19.570> here<00:03:19.990> something

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
middle turns out he's not here something

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.010 
middle turns out he's not here something
all<00:03:21.190> right<00:03:21.370> I<00:03:21.580> have<00:03:22.390> two<00:03:22.510> choices<00:03:22.660> I<00:03:22.900> can

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:23.020 
all right I have two choices I can

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.930 
all right I have two choices I can
either<00:03:23.200> go<00:03:23.290> ARB<00:03:23.650> so<00:03:23.890> I<00:03:23.950> do<00:03:24.010> decide<00:03:24.220> to<00:03:24.459> go<00:03:24.490> B<00:03:24.730> and

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
either go ARB so I do decide to go B and

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.900 
either go ARB so I do decide to go B and
it<00:03:25.900> turns<00:03:26.140> out<00:03:26.350> that<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.890> think<00:03:27.520> in<00:03:27.640> my<00:03:27.760> head

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
it turns out that I think in my head

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.340 
it turns out that I think in my head
that<00:03:28.030> I'm<00:03:28.120> gonna<00:03:28.240> planet<00:03:28.540> facing<00:03:28.900> our<00:03:29.020> spawn

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
that I'm gonna planet facing our spawn

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.110 
that I'm gonna planet facing our spawn
and<00:03:29.590> run<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.370> their<00:03:30.490> respond<00:03:30.820> because<00:03:30.970> I'm

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
and run to their respond because I'm

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.470 
and run to their respond because I'm
really<00:03:31.360> smart<00:03:31.660> but<00:03:31.720> it<00:03:31.959> turns<00:03:32.140> out<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.620> get

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
really smart but it turns out I get

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.449 
really smart but it turns out I get
unlucky<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.810> he<00:03:34.990> has<00:03:35.080> really<00:03:35.110> good<00:03:35.530> timing<00:03:36.010> so

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
unlucky and he has really good timing so

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.760 
unlucky and he has really good timing so
you<00:03:37.120> know<00:03:37.240> search<00:03:38.050> and<00:03:38.170> destroy<00:03:38.290> you<00:03:38.590> know

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 
you know search and destroy you know

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.890 
you know search and destroy you know
it's<00:03:38.950> all<00:03:39.100> timing<00:03:39.340> it's<00:03:39.580> all<00:03:39.700> luck<00:03:39.910> that<00:03:40.600> round

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
it's all timing it's all luck that round

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.440 
it's all timing it's all luck that round
I<00:03:41.020> decided<00:03:41.350> to<00:03:41.560> go<00:03:41.709> be<00:03:41.950> it<00:03:42.190> turns<00:03:42.970> out<00:03:43.090> he<00:03:43.270> was

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
I decided to go be it turns out he was

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.270 
I decided to go be it turns out he was
be<00:03:43.660> so<00:03:43.900> if<00:03:43.990> i<00:03:44.080> woulda<00:03:44.260> when<00:03:44.440> I<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:45.010> know<00:03:45.040> who

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
be so if i woulda when I you know who

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.370 
be so if i woulda when I you know who
knows<00:03:45.459> I<00:03:45.490> might<00:03:45.730> have<00:03:45.880> won<00:03:46.000> the<00:03:46.120> round<00:03:46.270> but<00:03:47.020> we

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
knows I might have won the round but we

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.260 
knows I might have won the round but we
are<00:03:47.500> down<00:03:47.680> one<00:03:47.709> two<00:03:47.920> and<00:03:48.340> i<00:03:48.790> know<00:03:48.850> that<00:03:49.120> this

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
are down one two and i know that this

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:50.400 
are down one two and i know that this
next<00:03:49.570> round<00:03:49.690> is<00:03:49.840> going<00:03:49.990> to<00:03:50.080> be<00:03:50.140> really

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
next round is going to be really

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:51.750 
next round is going to be really
important<00:03:50.860> because<00:03:50.950> it's<00:03:51.220> either<00:03:51.459> we're<00:03:51.640> down

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
important because it's either we're down

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.910 
important because it's either we're down
13<00:03:52.209> and<00:03:52.240> they<00:03:52.390> need<00:03:52.540> one<00:03:52.690> round<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:53.020> win<00:03:53.140> or<00:03:53.620> its

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:53.920 
13 and they need one round to win or its

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.030 
13 and they need one round to win or its
22<00:03:54.190> and<00:03:54.610> make<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.150> closer<00:03:55.390> to<00:03:55.540> winning<00:03:55.900> so<00:03:56.650> i<00:03:56.950> do

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
22 and make it closer to winning so i do

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.949 
22 and make it closer to winning so i do
expect<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.610> be<00:03:57.730> rush<00:03:57.910> again<00:03:58.180> turns<00:03:58.660> out<00:03:58.840> they

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
expect to be rush again turns out they

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.280 
expect to be rush again turns out they
don't<00:03:59.080> go<00:03:59.290> there<00:03:59.530> end<00:03:59.650> up<00:03:59.740> going<00:03:59.920> to<00:03:59.980> go<00:04:00.100> up<00:04:00.280> a

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
don't go there end up going to go up a

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.830 
don't go there end up going to go up a
this<00:04:02.290> round<00:04:02.560> so<00:04:03.310> obviously<00:04:04.300> i<00:04:04.390> do<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.690> same

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
this round so obviously i do the same

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.300 
this round so obviously i do the same
thing<00:04:04.990> in<00:04:05.080> the<00:04:05.170> last<00:04:05.380> round<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.800> i<00:04:05.860> did<00:04:06.070> see

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
thing in the last round and i did see

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:30.709 
22 so that's great that should not have
gone<00:05:28.379> to<00:05:28.650> a<00:05:28.680> 1v1<00:05:29.129> and<00:05:29.580> I<00:05:30.120> would<00:05:30.270> have<00:05:30.330> been<00:05:30.479> mad

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 
gone to a 1v1 and I would have been mad

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:32.089 
gone to a 1v1 and I would have been mad
if<00:05:30.779> we<00:05:31.080> would<00:05:31.289> have<00:05:31.409> lost<00:05:31.500> that<00:05:31.680> round<00:05:31.889> because

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
if we would have lost that round because

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.339 
if we would have lost that round because
we<00:05:32.310> did<00:05:32.490> have<00:05:32.520> him<00:05:32.789> trapped<00:05:33.060> and<00:05:33.330> he<00:05:34.229> was

00:05:34.339 --> 00:05:34.349 
we did have him trapped and he was

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:36.110 
we did have him trapped and he was
basically<00:05:34.529> juking<00:05:35.129> the<00:05:35.250> fucking<00:05:35.580> of<00:05:35.669> both<00:05:35.909> of

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
basically juking the fucking of both of

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.209 
basically juking the fucking of both of
us<00:05:36.240> so<00:05:36.509> kudos<00:05:37.259> to<00:05:37.289> him<00:05:37.469> for<00:05:37.710> making<00:05:37.830> it<00:05:38.069> that

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:38.219 
us so kudos to him for making it that

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:43.219 
us so kudos to him for making it that
far<00:05:38.490> but<00:05:39.379> almost<00:05:40.379> isn't<00:05:40.830> enough<00:05:41.069> so<00:05:41.909> we<00:05:42.270> are<00:05:42.539> 22

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:43.229 
far but almost isn't enough so we are 22

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:45.350 
far but almost isn't enough so we are 22
right<00:05:43.500> now<00:05:43.680> so<00:05:44.490> here<00:05:44.669> I<00:05:44.699> decide<00:05:45.089> that<00:05:45.120> I'm

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.360 
right now so here I decide that I'm

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.640 
right now so here I decide that I'm
going<00:05:45.449> to<00:05:45.509> take<00:05:45.629> out<00:05:45.779> the<00:05:45.870> I<00:05:45.900> fail<00:05:46.139> again<00:05:46.379> and

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
going to take out the I fail again and

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:48.379 
going to take out the I fail again and
we're<00:05:47.159> going<00:05:47.310> to<00:05:47.370> play<00:05:47.520> a<00:05:47.550> slow<00:05:48.089> kind<00:05:48.330> of

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
we're going to play a slow kind of

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:50.570 
we're going to play a slow kind of
offense<00:05:48.750> so<00:05:48.990> rexy<00:05:49.770> decides<00:05:50.099> that<00:05:50.250> we're<00:05:50.430> going

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
offense so rexy decides that we're going

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.309 
offense so rexy decides that we're going
to<00:05:50.639> go<00:05:50.729> a<00:05:50.759> so<00:05:50.909> automatically<00:05:51.599> I<00:05:51.750> tell<00:05:52.020> them<00:05:52.110> to

00:05:52.309 --> 00:05:52.319 
to go a so automatically I tell them to

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:54.709 
to go a so automatically I tell them to
try<00:05:52.889> to<00:05:52.949> sneak<00:05:53.159> a<00:05:53.310> plant<00:05:53.550> and<00:05:53.729> I'm<00:05:54.300> going<00:05:54.509> to<00:05:54.539> be

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:54.719 
try to sneak a plant and I'm going to be

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.110 
try to sneak a plant and I'm going to be
top<00:05:55.349> glass<00:05:55.650> now<00:05:56.250> this<00:05:56.400> is<00:05:56.460> smart<00:05:56.819> to<00:05:56.940> do

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
top glass now this is smart to do

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.790 
top glass now this is smart to do
because<00:05:57.330> not<00:05:57.750> a<00:05:57.779> lot<00:05:57.870> of<00:05:57.990> people<00:05:58.169> expect<00:05:58.650> it

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
because not a lot of people expect it

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.640 
because not a lot of people expect it
and<00:05:58.979> a<00:05:59.039> lot<00:05:59.550> of<00:05:59.610> people<00:05:59.839> like<00:06:00.839> to<00:06:00.870> go<00:06:01.080> top<00:06:01.379> money

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:01.650 
and a lot of people like to go top money

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.040 
and a lot of people like to go top money
on<00:06:01.889> defense<00:06:02.819> so<00:06:03.029> I<00:06:03.060> see<00:06:03.360> him<00:06:03.539> planning<00:06:03.900> right

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:04.050 
on defense so I see him planning right

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.260 
on defense so I see him planning right
here<00:06:04.229> and<00:06:04.889> I'm<00:06:05.339> checking<00:06:05.669> this<00:06:05.909> because<00:06:06.180> I

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
here and I'm checking this because I

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.969 
here and I'm checking this because I
know<00:06:06.330> he's<00:06:06.539> going<00:06:06.690> to<00:06:06.750> check<00:06:06.990> it<00:06:07.169> or<00:06:07.680> I<00:06:07.710> thought

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:07.979 
know he's going to check it or I thought

00:06:07.979 --> 00:06:09.140 
know he's going to check it or I thought
he<00:06:08.099> was<00:06:08.219> going<00:06:08.310> to<00:06:08.370> check<00:06:08.580> because<00:06:08.759> he<00:06:08.969> was

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150 
he was going to check because he was

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.930 
he was going to check because he was
money<00:06:09.449> and<00:06:09.919> he<00:06:10.919> gets<00:06:11.099> the<00:06:11.219> bomb<00:06:11.370> plants<00:06:11.789> i'm

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
money and he gets the bomb plants i'm

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.149 
money and he gets the bomb plants i'm
thinking<00:06:12.360> maybe<00:06:12.990> he's<00:06:13.259> flanking<00:06:13.710> so<00:06:13.830> i<00:06:13.860> peek

00:06:14.149 --> 00:06:14.159 
thinking maybe he's flanking so i peek

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:15.829 
thinking maybe he's flanking so i peek
here<00:06:14.370> because<00:06:14.669> usually<00:06:14.819> one<00:06:15.180> flying<00:06:15.419> Sun<00:06:15.659> raid

00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:15.839 
here because usually one flying Sun raid

00:06:15.839 --> 00:06:18.110 
here because usually one flying Sun raid
and<00:06:16.080> now<00:06:17.039> I'm<00:06:17.219> just<00:06:17.279> going<00:06:17.400> to<00:06:17.520> go<00:06:17.580> now<00:06:17.759> locusts

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
and now I'm just going to go now locusts

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.640 
and now I'm just going to go now locusts
up<00:06:18.270> top<00:06:18.419> is<00:06:18.569> a<00:06:18.599> really<00:06:19.020> really<00:06:19.050> obvious

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:19.650 
up top is a really really obvious

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.079 
up top is a really really obvious
especially<00:06:19.889> if<00:06:20.190> the<00:06:20.279> bomb<00:06:20.430> planted<00:06:20.639> facing

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:21.089 
especially if the bomb planted facing

00:06:21.089 --> 00:06:23.059 
especially if the bomb planted facing
your<00:06:21.180> spawn<00:06:21.419> the<00:06:22.229> other<00:06:22.379> team<00:06:22.560> is<00:06:22.710> definitely

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:23.069 
your spawn the other team is definitely

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:24.050 
your spawn the other team is definitely
going<00:06:23.159> to<00:06:23.250> look<00:06:23.339> top<00:06:23.520> glass<00:06:23.699> so<00:06:23.879> if<00:06:23.940> you're

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:24.060 
going to look top glass so if you're

going to look top glass so if you're
going<00:06:24.150> top<00:06:24.360> glass<00:06:24.569> I<00:06:24.900> recommend<00:06:25.520> you<00:06:26.520> go<00:06:26.699> to

00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 
going top glass I recommend you go to

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.100 
going top glass I recommend you go to
the<00:06:27.000> bottom<00:06:27.150> floor<00:06:27.330> like<00:06:27.569> I<00:06:27.659> did<00:06:27.810> here<00:06:27.839> so<00:06:28.050> I

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
the bottom floor like I did here so I

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.950 
the bottom floor like I did here so I
got<00:06:28.199> a<00:06:28.229> quick<00:06:28.440> little<00:06:28.650> head<00:06:28.949> shot<00:06:29.190> and<00:06:29.750> we<00:06:30.750> pick

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 
got a quick little head shot and we pick

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:33.469 
got a quick little head shot and we pick
off<00:06:31.110> the<00:06:31.319> round<00:06:31.529> so<00:06:31.770> it<00:06:31.919> is<00:06:32.039> 32<00:06:32.310> we<00:06:33.060> need<00:06:33.209> one
