00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:06.180 
much the most i guess secondary combo
you'd<00:04:03.970> run<00:04:04.209> with<00:04:04.510> these<00:04:04.630> two<00:04:04.870> cards<00:04:05.200> it's<00:04:05.980> not

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
you'd run with these two cards it's not

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.680 
you'd run with these two cards it's not
perfect<00:04:06.610> because<00:04:06.700> sometimes<00:04:07.269> you<00:04:07.390> don't<00:04:07.510> have

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
perfect because sometimes you don't have

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.890 
perfect because sometimes you don't have
to<00:04:07.840> open<00:04:08.110> so<00:04:08.230> i<00:04:08.260> suggest<00:04:08.739> run<00:04:09.630> play<00:04:10.630> every

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
to open so i suggest run play every

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.680 
to open so i suggest run play every
recharge<00:04:11.350> all<00:04:11.739> right<00:04:12.060> it's<00:04:13.060> another<00:04:13.269> combo

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
recharge all right it's another combo

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.900 
recharge all right it's another combo
you<00:04:13.930> can<00:04:14.110> do<00:04:14.200> with<00:04:14.320> the<00:04:14.440> deck<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:17.910> obviously

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
you can do with the deck and obviously

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.290 
you can do with the deck and obviously
you<00:04:20.220> could<00:04:21.220> go<00:04:21.310> into<00:04:21.520> your<00:04:21.789> other<00:04:21.910> syncros

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
you could go into your other syncros

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.140 
you could go into your other syncros
which<00:04:22.510> would<00:04:22.810> be<00:04:22.960> one<00:04:23.470> tempest<00:04:23.979> and<00:04:24.220> one<00:04:25.030> of

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
which would be one tempest and one of

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.740 
which would be one tempest and one of
your<00:04:25.270> tuner

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
your tuner

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.860 
your tuner
so<00:04:26.700> let's<00:04:27.700> say<00:04:27.820> you<00:04:27.850> have<00:04:28.120> one<00:04:28.420> of<00:04:28.540> these<00:04:28.630> cards

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
so let's say you have one of these cards

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.780 
so let's say you have one of these cards
in<00:04:28.990> your<00:04:29.050> hand<00:04:29.230> and<00:04:29.500> then<00:04:29.740> you<00:04:29.920> want<00:04:30.100> each<00:04:30.340> your

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
topic tempest you special summon it

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:40.860 
topic tempest you special summon it
normal<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.820> go<00:04:34.300> into<00:04:34.510> your<00:04:36.720> level<00:04:37.720> eight<00:04:39.870> and

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
um I just wanted to explain a couple

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.820 
um I just wanted to explain a couple
cards<00:05:10.270> but<00:05:10.450> that's<00:05:10.660> pretty<00:05:10.810> much<00:05:10.930> sum<00:05:11.590> of<00:05:11.740> the

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:11.830 
cards but that's pretty much sum of the

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:13.770 
cards but that's pretty much sum of the
commas<00:05:12.160> you<00:05:12.220> can<00:05:12.400> do<00:05:12.550> obviously<00:05:13.210> control

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
commas you can do obviously control

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.800 
commas you can do obviously control
levels<00:05:14.169> and<00:05:14.320> whatnot<00:05:14.830> with<00:05:15.010> this<00:05:15.160> deck<00:05:15.430> so<00:05:15.810> you

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
levels and whatnot with this deck so you

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.659 
levels and whatnot with this deck so you
could've<00:05:17.050> been<00:05:17.169> going<00:05:17.350> to<00:05:17.500> ptolemy<00:05:18.220> with<00:05:18.400> rank

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
could've been going to ptolemy with rank

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.350 
could've been going to ptolemy with rank
set<00:05:18.940> or<00:05:19.150> six<00:05:19.540> and<00:05:19.750> stuff<00:05:19.900> like<00:05:20.020> that<00:05:20.080> so<00:05:21.360> that's

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
set or six and stuff like that so that's

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.940 
set or six and stuff like that so that's
pretty<00:05:22.540> much<00:05:22.600> it<00:05:22.720> that's<00:05:23.080> my<00:05:23.200> explanation<00:05:23.380> for

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:23.950 
pretty much it that's my explanation for

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:27.750 
pretty much it that's my explanation for
the<00:05:24.370> mecha<00:05:24.580> phantom<00:05:24.760> beast<00:05:25.060> right<00:05:25.300> all<00:05:25.690> right
