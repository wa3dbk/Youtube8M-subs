00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.160
 hi then in this video we will see 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.350
 how to make a fantastic tornado 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.380
 ball then level gear already he will you 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.810
 have a medicine ball a son and two 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.810
 basketball baskets a little bit of 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:33.879
 string to hang all that and that's 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.829
 it's all gone after it's missing 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.140
 more than knowing how to make a few knots 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.020
 who hold and it's good then down 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.420
 first thing we will put the medicine 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.480
 in the basketball net we are going to tie 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:48.760
 an end by connecting all of them 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.110
 the ends of the thing we do a little 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.540
 sial like the picture 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.100
 after once it's done that's it 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.380
 give that we do the same on the other side 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.969
 so good I like a girl that's 

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.950
 the story of two hold in the meantime and 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:05.040
 well here we are not obliged to 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.119
 do that it's just time to fix 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.700
 this rope 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.880
 so here you need a big one too 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.439
 rope like that for style is good on 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.389
 makes a potato after 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.249
 story that it makes joly we fix it 

00:01:16.389 --> 00:01:20.380
 all right and here we go now 

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:22.899
 able to fix it so that we the trick 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.200
 in there we make a beautiful lattice wise 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:28.630
 like like I did on my 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.999
 machete for example it's a little bit 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.549
 that the idea good except that here is the goal 

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:35.079
 it's just okay, and as he does not 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.889
 potatoes at the bottom end that makes that 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:41.979
 even with the extreme pressure of 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:43.810
 tornado ball and ben that it will not move 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:46.209
 once you've done some 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.669
 strings of strings we fold the pieces 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:51.939
 who stayed and gold did the same 

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:53.200
 going renault is right after the big 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.079
 node is alas at once that's 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.909
 fact go everywhere and well here it is 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.669
 everything is finished you have a tornado 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.549
 bowl of what to play with what to do 

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:05.739
 shake the walls of your home that of your 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.069
 neighbors it can be possibly more 

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:11.739
 funny and that's all it's a pure tool to 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.990
 some nice exo to do with 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:16.720
 so more of that is that you 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:18.550
 can easily detached the tip and 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.780
 recover medicine ball 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.880
 so you can keep both played on 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.680
 in fact we can maintain this 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.900
 application the the technique that I you 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.340
 have shown there in fact she is a little 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.960
 complicated finally there is something 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.090
 much simpler you take a 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.850
 frock leggings you the cut and you 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.430
 put the tornado in a Thai zip of 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.770
 each side and it's finished good 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.910
 the disadvantage is that after these it is 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.120
 possibly a little harder for 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:50.020
 recover the tornado finally good while 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.660
 the la just 2 just untie the 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.210
 tip and thinkers the trick of the net 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.580
 so I hope you'll like it 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:59.410
 a tool that smashes and that is really 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.870
 not very well known so if that gave you 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:04.270
 want to make one 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.880
 well then that's fine there who 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.550
 are sold all done as well except that 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.850
 blow we have we do not have the side 2 in 1 we 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:15.470
 can not recover the the medicine ball 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.840
 to play with next so 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.530
 Well, that's all you have a good time with 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.530
 that bye
