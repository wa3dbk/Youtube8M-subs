black<00:01:58.710> controller<00:01:59.390> what<00:02:00.390> i<00:02:00.420> did<00:02:00.689> do<00:02:00.840> though<00:02:01.049> is

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
black controller what i did do though is

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.959 
black controller what i did do though is
i<00:02:01.799> got<00:02:02.430> the<00:02:03.360> ps3<00:02:04.020> dome<00:02:04.560> sticks<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.280> both<00:02:05.790> the

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
i got the ps3 dome sticks on both the

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.440 
i got the ps3 dome sticks on both the
left<00:02:06.180> and<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.630> right<00:02:06.780> thumb<00:02:07.259> stick<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:09.000> these

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
left and the right thumb stick so these

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.290 
left and the right thumb stick so these
are<00:02:09.509> ps3<00:02:10.440> dome<00:02:10.649> sticks<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.310> blacked<00:02:12.000> out<00:02:12.120> all

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
are ps3 dome sticks I blacked out all

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.250 
are ps3 dome sticks I blacked out all
the<00:02:12.450> buttons

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the buttons

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.460 
the buttons
so<00:02:13.799> everything<00:02:14.640> on<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.939> is<00:02:15.060> blacked<00:02:15.420> out<00:02:15.659> at

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
so everything on it is blacked out at

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.170 
so everything on it is blacked out at
the<00:02:17.540> it's<00:02:18.540> it's<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:19.079> wired<00:02:19.349> controller<00:02:20.069> so<00:02:21.030> on

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the it's it's a wired controller so on

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.860 
the it's it's a wired controller so on
the<00:02:21.360> back<00:02:21.569> there's<00:02:22.230> no<00:02:22.819> battery<00:02:23.819> pack<00:02:24.060> it's

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
the back there's no battery pack it's

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.960 
the back there's no battery pack it's
flat<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.890> also<00:02:26.040> had<00:02:26.340> them<00:02:26.459> take<00:02:26.670> out<00:02:26.819> the

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
flat and I also had them take out the

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.880 
flat and I also had them take out the
rumbler<00:02:27.390> packs<00:02:27.659> so<00:02:28.140> this<00:02:28.349> controller<00:02:28.769> is

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
rumbler packs so this controller is

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.000 
rumbler packs so this controller is
really<00:02:29.370> quite<00:02:29.640> light<00:02:30.019> my<00:02:31.019> paddle<00:02:31.470> buttons<00:02:31.799> are

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
really quite light my paddle buttons are

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.729 
really quite light my paddle buttons are
in<00:02:32.159> red<00:02:32.569> which<00:02:33.569> I<00:02:33.720> thought<00:02:33.900> would<00:02:34.260> set<00:02:34.500> it<00:02:34.530> off

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
in red which I thought would set it off

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.740 
in red which I thought would set it off
a<00:02:34.769> little<00:02:34.920> bit<00:02:35.310> and<00:02:35.549> those<00:02:36.030> are<00:02:36.060> designated

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
a little bit and those are designated

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.349 
a little bit and those are designated
for<00:02:36.780> your<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.230> B<00:02:37.769> X<00:02:37.950> Y<00:02:38.370> buttons<00:02:38.790> on<00:02:38.970> this

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:39.359 
for your a B X Y buttons on this

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.149 
for your a B X Y buttons on this
particular<00:02:39.690> controller<00:02:40.319> I<00:02:40.440> haven't<00:02:40.980> set<00:02:41.129> up

00:02:41.149 --> 00:02:41.159 
particular controller I haven't set up

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.580 
particular controller I haven't set up
for<00:02:41.459> a<00:02:41.489> B<00:02:41.819> for<00:02:42.239> the<00:02:42.359> jump<00:02:42.659> and<00:02:42.840> for<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.230> knifing

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
for a B for the jump and for the knifing

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.140 
for a B for the jump and for the knifing
so<00:02:43.859> that<00:02:44.010> I<00:02:44.040> don't<00:02:44.159> have<00:02:44.340> to<00:02:44.459> take<00:02:44.670> my<00:02:44.879> thumb

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
so that I don't have to take my thumb

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.990 
so that I don't have to take my thumb
off<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.329> controller<00:02:46.489> when<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.519> want<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:47.879> do

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
off the controller when I want to do

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.839 
off the controller when I want to do
those<00:02:48.239> things<00:02:48.680> on<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.739> little<00:02:50.519> closer

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
those things on a little closer

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.490 
those things on a little closer
inspection<00:02:51.120> you<00:02:51.780> can<00:02:51.930> see<00:02:52.109> these<00:02:52.290> little

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
inspection you can see these little

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.670 
inspection you can see these little
silver<00:02:53.299> trigger<00:02:54.299> stops<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:54.959> basically<00:02:55.530> what

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
silver trigger stops so basically what

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.949 
silver trigger stops so basically what
they<00:02:55.829> are<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.190> is<00:02:56.400> there<00:02:57.030> sit<00:02:57.389> right<00:02:57.599> in<00:02:57.629> there

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
they are is is there sit right in there

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.259 
they are is is there sit right in there
and<00:02:58.139> they<00:02:58.379> stop<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:59.700> movement<00:02:59.970> of<00:03:00.209> the

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
and they stop the movement of the

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.759 
and they stop the movement of the
trigger<00:03:00.569> from<00:03:00.810> going<00:03:01.139> all<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.440> way<00:03:01.560> down

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
trigger from going all the way down

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.740 
trigger from going all the way down
which<00:03:02.549> will<00:03:02.730> increase<00:03:02.970> your<00:03:03.090> speed<00:03:03.480> when

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
which will increase your speed when

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.830 
which will increase your speed when
you're<00:03:03.870> using<00:03:04.109> semi-automatic<00:03:05.099> weapons<00:03:05.840> they

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
you're using semi-automatic weapons they

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.349 
you're using semi-automatic weapons they
also<00:03:06.989> have<00:03:07.290> that<00:03:07.470> on<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.920> inside<00:03:08.549> also<00:03:09.150> it's

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
also have that on the inside also it's

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.199 
also have that on the inside also it's
very<00:03:09.930> similar<00:03:10.579> they<00:03:11.579> just<00:03:11.819> have<00:03:11.940> a<00:03:12.000> little

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
very similar they just have a little

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.550 
very similar they just have a little
stopped<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:13.049> bond<00:03:13.290> there<00:03:13.470> or<00:03:13.920> you<00:03:14.040> look<00:03:14.250> at<00:03:15.560> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
stopped a bond there or you look at the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.289 
stopped a bond there or you look at the
interesting<00:03:16.950> feature<00:03:17.159> is<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.489> hair<00:03:17.819> triggers

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
interesting feature is the hair triggers

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.900 
interesting feature is the hair triggers
they<00:03:18.930> have<00:03:19.139> right<00:03:19.530> at<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.769> very<00:03:19.799> front<00:03:20.280> it's

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
they have right at the very front it's

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.400 
they have right at the very front it's
hard<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.299> see<00:03:21.449> because<00:03:21.569> everything<00:03:22.049> is<00:03:22.169> black

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
hard to see because everything is black

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.470 
hard to see because everything is black
they<00:03:22.799> have<00:03:23.010> these<00:03:23.220> Allen<00:03:23.790> screws<00:03:24.150> that<00:03:24.419> are

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
they have these Allen screws that are

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.500 
they have these Allen screws that are
right<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.379> front<00:03:26.010> here<00:03:26.359> basically<00:03:27.359> if<00:03:27.419> you

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
right in the front here basically if you

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.150 
right in the front here basically if you
watch<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.840> videos<00:03:28.139> you<00:03:28.260> can<00:03:28.379> see<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.769> screw

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
watch the videos you can see you screw

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.479 
watch the videos you can see you screw
then<00:03:29.879> then<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.959> set<00:03:31.169> up<00:03:31.290> your<00:03:31.410> shot<00:03:31.470> where<00:03:32.069> your

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
then then to set up your shot where your

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.949 
then then to set up your shot where your
it's<00:03:32.760> almost<00:03:33.000> like<00:03:33.239> having<00:03:33.389> a<00:03:33.629> modded

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
it's almost like having a modded

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:35.750 
it's almost like having a modded
controller<00:03:34.349> but<00:03:35.069> once<00:03:35.340> again<00:03:35.489> these<00:03:35.699> are

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
controller but once again these are

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.819 
controller but once again these are
legal<00:03:36.359> both<00:03:37.139> in<00:03:37.829> MLG<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.819> european<00:03:39.829> league

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
legal both in MLG and european league

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:43.490 
legal both in MLG and european league
gaming<00:03:41.099> so<00:03:41.940> i<00:03:42.269> thought<00:03:42.840> i'd<00:03:43.019> just<00:03:43.079> do<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.319> quick

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
gaming so i thought i'd just do a quick

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.259 
gaming so i thought i'd just do a quick
unboxing<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.250> take<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.489> look<00:03:44.669> at<00:03:44.819> it<00:03:44.849> it's<00:03:45.150> a

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269 
unboxing so you take a look at it it's a

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.839 
unboxing so you take a look at it it's a
pretty<00:03:45.480> nice<00:03:45.690> controller<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:47.340> only<00:03:47.579> costs

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
pretty nice controller it only costs

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.900 
pretty nice controller it only costs
about<00:03:48.440> 123<00:03:49.440> dollars<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.099> then<00:03:50.190> after<00:03:50.459> tax<00:03:50.730> and

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
about 123 dollars and then after tax and

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.720 
about 123 dollars and then after tax and
whatnot<00:03:51.209> was<00:03:51.389> like<00:03:51.590> 126<00:03:52.590> total<00:03:53.010> I<00:03:53.099> think<00:03:53.400> cost

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
whatnot was like 126 total I think cost

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.599 
whatnot was like 126 total I think cost
126<00:03:54.599> bucks<00:03:54.949> obviously<00:03:55.949> go<00:03:56.159> a<00:03:56.190> little<00:03:56.430> bit

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:56.609
