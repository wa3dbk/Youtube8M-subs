00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
I've been teaching the guitar one-on-one

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.130 
I've been teaching the guitar one-on-one
for<00:01:37.710> long<00:01:37.860> enough<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.340> to<00:01:38.610> know<00:01:39.140> really

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
for long enough now to know really

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.499 
for long enough now to know really
matters<00:01:40.530> ok<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.220> that's<00:01:41.369> giving<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.820> easy<00:01:42.060> to

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
matters ok and that's giving you easy to

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.810 
matters ok and that's giving you easy to
understand<00:01:42.990> bite-size<00:01:43.920> chunks<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.399> theory

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
understand bite-size chunks of theory

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.429 
understand bite-size chunks of theory
that<00:01:45.180> you<00:01:45.299> can<00:01:45.420> then<00:01:45.570> easily<00:01:45.869> put<00:01:46.290> into

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
that you can then easily put into

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.760 
that you can then easily put into
practice<00:01:46.860> ok<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.060> so<00:01:48.630> then<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.200> understand

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
practice ok and so then you understand

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.749 
practice ok and so then you understand
how<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.100> create<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> solos<00:01:50.970> yourself<00:01:51.450> and

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:52.759 
how to create the solos yourself and

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.399 
how to create the solos yourself and
understand<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:53.850> theory<00:01:54.119> behind<00:01:54.360> them<00:01:54.780> there

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
understand the theory behind them there

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.130 
understand the theory behind them there

this solo play that solo actually how to
make<00:02:45.520> one<00:02:45.730> yourself<00:02:45.880> I<00:02:46.420> go<00:02:46.930> through<00:02:47.080> things

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
make one yourself I go through things

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.880 
make one yourself I go through things
like<00:02:47.470> phrasing<00:02:48.420> dynamics<00:02:49.420> melody<00:02:50.290> different

book<00:02:53.140> ok<00:02:53.890> so<00:02:53.950> I'm<00:02:54.100> not<00:02:54.250> there<00:02:54.610> telling<00:02:54.970> you<00:02:55.090> you

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
book ok so I'm not there telling you you

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.300 
book ok so I'm not there telling you you
must<00:02:55.959> play<00:02:56.200> this<00:02:56.350> note<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.800> must<00:02:56.920> play<00:02:57.130> that

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
must play this note you must play that

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:58.470 
must play this note you must play that
note<00:02:57.489> you<00:02:57.640> must<00:02:57.790> play<00:02:58.030> that<00:02:58.180> note<00:02:58.330> because

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
note you must play that note because

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:59.970 
note you must play that note because
that<00:02:58.750> again<00:02:59.110> I'm<00:02:59.350> just<00:02:59.530> telling<00:02:59.739> you<00:02:59.770> what<00:02:59.890> to

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
that again I'm just telling you what to

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.520 
that again I'm just telling you what to
do<00:03:00.130> so<00:03:00.760> we're<00:03:01.060> not<00:03:01.180> doing<00:03:01.840> paint-by-numbers

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
do so we're not doing paint-by-numbers

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.140 
do so we're not doing paint-by-numbers
the<00:03:02.920> same<00:03:03.130> thing<00:03:03.310> when<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:03.489> give<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.820> scale

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
the same thing when I give you the scale

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.820 
the same thing when I give you the scale
diagrams<00:03:04.690> I'm<00:03:04.840> marking<00:03:05.170> out<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.290> root<00:03:05.620> notes

and any important notes on there and

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.600 
and any important notes on there and
which<00:03:08.200> notes<00:03:08.530> give<00:03:08.860> that<00:03:09.040> scale<00:03:09.370> its

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
which notes give that scale its

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.150 
which notes give that scale its
particular<00:03:09.880> character<00:03:10.750> and<00:03:10.989> how<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:11.950> apply

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
particular character and how to apply

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.940 
particular character and how to apply
them<00:03:12.550> in<00:03:12.610> your<00:03:12.760> own<00:03:12.820> solos<00:03:13.360> and<00:03:13.540> every<00:03:14.440> time<00:03:14.709> I

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
them in your own solos and every time I

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.650 
them in your own solos and every time I
mention<00:03:15.580> a<00:03:15.790> piece<00:03:15.910> of<00:03:15.940> music<00:03:16.090> theory<00:03:16.450> that's

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
mention a piece of music theory that's

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.130 
mention a piece of music theory that's
important<00:03:17.230> I<00:03:17.440> break<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.489> down<00:03:18.730> into<00:03:19.360> bite-size

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
important I break it down into bite-size

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.440 
important I break it down into bite-size
chunks<00:03:20.170> that<00:03:20.650> are<00:03:20.830> easy<00:03:21.070> to<00:03:21.220> assimilate<00:03:21.970> so

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
chunks that are easy to assimilate so

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.820 
chunks that are easy to assimilate so
you'll<00:03:22.600> be<00:03:22.690> picking<00:03:22.989> up<00:03:23.050> theory<00:03:23.470> at<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:23.620> same

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
you'll be picking up theory at the same

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.699 
you'll be picking up theory at the same
time<00:03:24.040> really<00:03:24.700> the<00:03:24.790> books<00:03:25.000> about<00:03:25.269> playing<00:03:25.870> but

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
time really the books about playing but

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.199 
time really the books about playing but
you'll<00:03:26.890> be<00:03:26.950> picking<00:03:27.310> up<00:03:27.340> theory<00:03:27.730> along<00:03:28.090> the

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
you'll be picking up theory along the

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:29.759 
you'll be picking up theory along the
way<00:03:28.330> so<00:03:28.720> you<00:03:28.780> just<00:03:28.989> picking<00:03:29.320> up<00:03:29.350> the<00:03:29.410> theory

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
way so you just picking up the theory

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.350 
way so you just picking up the theory
that's<00:03:29.920> useful<00:03:30.190> to<00:03:30.489> you<00:03:30.610> so<00:03:31.030> if<00:03:31.120> you<00:03:31.180> want<00:03:31.330> to

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360
