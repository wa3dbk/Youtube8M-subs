came<00:00:48.450> from<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.719> fact<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.590> only<00:00:49.829> place<00:00:50.010> I

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
came from the fact that the only place I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.170 
came from the fact that the only place I
could<00:00:50.280> actually<00:00:50.399> sight

was a quite established pear tree so it

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.430 
was a quite established pear tree so it
had<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.000> go<00:00:57.300> unfortunately<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.020> sort<00:00:58.199> of<00:00:58.260> felt

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
equipment but some years back I decided

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.440 
equipment but some years back I decided
that<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:11.729> there's<00:01:11.880> not<00:01:11.970> much<00:01:12.090> fun<00:01:12.299> in

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
that you know there's not much fun in

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.390 
that you know there's not much fun in
doing<00:01:12.570> that<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.320> plan<00:01:13.530> was<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.860> have<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.130> a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
doing that so the plan was to have a a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.030 
doing that so the plan was to have a a
wireless<00:01:14.970> internet<00:01:15.119> link<00:01:16.110> between<00:01:16.290> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
wireless internet link between the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.910 
wireless internet link between the
observatory<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.000> study<00:01:18.330> upstairs<00:01:18.630> so<00:01:19.619> I

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
observatory and the study upstairs so I

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.710 
observatory and the study upstairs so I
come<00:01:20.220> out<00:01:20.340> here<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:20.610> fire<00:01:20.850> everything<00:01:21.150> up<00:01:21.450> and

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
come out here and fire everything up and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.170 
come out here and fire everything up and
then<00:01:21.869> once<00:01:22.080> that's<00:01:22.320> done<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.979> go<00:01:23.520> inside<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.150> the

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.600 
con think of many ways to actually
improve<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.530> setup<00:01:37.920> as<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:40.340> want<00:01:41.340> me<00:01:41.460> to

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
improve the setup as it is want me to

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.350 
improve the setup as it is want me to
give<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.420> camera<00:01:42.720> here<00:01:43.189> you<00:01:44.189> got<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.460> if

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
give you the camera here you got it if

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.789 
give you the camera here you got it if
we<00:01:45.570> sort<00:01:45.720> break<00:01:45.930> this<00:01:46.079> down<00:01:46.290> into<00:01:46.649> its

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
we sort break this down into its

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.490 
we sort break this down into its
individual<00:01:47.399> components<00:01:47.460> from<00:01:48.149> here<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:49.079> here

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
individual components from here to here

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.770 
individual components from here to here
is<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:50.159> equatorial<00:01:50.850> mount<00:01:50.880> the<00:01:51.360> equipment

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
is the equatorial mount the equipment

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.270 
is the equatorial mount the equipment
that<00:01:51.899> actually<00:01:52.200> tracks<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:52.680> motion<00:01:53.040> of<00:01:53.159> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that actually tracks the motion of the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.370 
that actually tracks the motion of the
sky<00:01:53.549> if<00:01:54.210> you<00:01:54.270> think<00:01:54.509> about<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.810> we're<00:01:54.990> on<00:01:55.020> a

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
sky if you think about it we're on a

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.649 
sky if you think about it we're on a
planet<00:01:55.740> that's<00:01:56.100> actually<00:01:56.520> rotating<00:01:57.149> once<00:01:57.390> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
planet that's actually rotating once a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.139 
planet that's actually rotating once a
day<00:01:57.899> once<00:01:58.110> every<00:01:58.350> 24<00:01:58.860> hours<00:01:58.890> now<00:01:59.759> from<00:02:00.030> our

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
day once every 24 hours now from our

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:01.880 
day once every 24 hours now from our
vantage<00:02:00.479> point<00:02:00.990> what<00:02:01.229> that<00:02:01.380> means<00:02:01.619> is

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
vantage point what that means is

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.010 
vantage point what that means is
everything<00:02:02.460> we<00:02:02.549> see<00:02:02.729> in<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.939> sky<00:02:03.149> is<00:02:03.390> moving

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
everything we see in the sky is moving

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.590 
everything we see in the sky is moving
across<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.409> sky<00:02:04.799> quite<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.670> significant<00:02:06.390> rate

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
across the sky quite a significant rate

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.570 
across the sky quite a significant rate
you<00:02:07.380> don't<00:02:07.619> really<00:02:07.860> notice<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.550> the

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
you don't really notice it in the

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.040 
you don't really notice it in the
daytime<00:02:09.030> by<00:02:09.149> looking<00:02:09.420> at<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.599> moon<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
daytime by looking at the moon in the

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.780 
daytime by looking at the moon in the
sky<00:02:10.080> if<00:02:10.800> you<00:02:10.950> look<00:02:11.129> through<00:02:11.340> a<00:02:11.400> powerful

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
sky if you look through a powerful

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.470 
sky if you look through a powerful
telescope<00:02:12.239> you<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.480> see<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.870> motion

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
telescope you can see that motion

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.839 
telescope you can see that motion
really<00:02:13.750> clearly<00:02:14.080> it's<00:02:14.379> very<00:02:14.620> fast<00:02:14.950> most<00:02:15.610> of

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
really clearly it's very fast most of

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.009 
really clearly it's very fast most of
the<00:02:15.909> targets<00:02:16.180> were<00:02:16.540> interested<00:02:16.959> in

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:17.019 
the targets were interested in

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.660 
the targets were interested in
photographing<00:02:17.319> they're<00:02:17.920> incredibly<00:02:18.340> faint

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
photographing they're incredibly faint

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.240 
photographing they're incredibly faint
so<00:02:19.330> we<00:02:19.450> have<00:02:19.569> to<00:02:19.690> take<00:02:19.870> very<00:02:20.230> long<00:02:20.319> exposures

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
so we have to take very long exposures

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.070 
so we have to take very long exposures
so<00:02:21.670> what<00:02:22.180> you<00:02:22.299> have<00:02:22.450> to<00:02:22.480> do<00:02:22.690> with<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.900> mount

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
so what you have to do with the mount

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.170 
so what you have to do with the mount
obviously<00:02:23.440> it<00:02:23.500> has<00:02:23.650> to<00:02:23.680> be<00:02:23.950> very<00:02:24.640> carefully

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
obviously it has to be very carefully

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.910 
obviously it has to be very carefully
aligned<00:02:25.450> on<00:02:25.599> a<00:02:25.629> point<00:02:25.930> in<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.230> sky<00:02:26.470> called<00:02:26.830> the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
aligned on a point in the sky called the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.470 
aligned on a point in the sky called the
North<00:02:27.129> celestial<00:02:27.610> Pole<00:02:27.849> which<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.180> just<00:02:28.390> an

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
North celestial Pole which is just an

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.420 
North celestial Pole which is just an
extension<00:02:29.019> of<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.230> Earth's<00:02:29.349> rotational<00:02:30.040> axis

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
extension of the Earth's rotational axis

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.130 
extension of the Earth's rotational axis
and<00:02:30.790> it's<00:02:30.910> marked<00:02:31.209> very<00:02:31.390> convenient<00:02:31.959> by<00:02:32.080> the

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
and it's marked very convenient by the

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.339 
and it's marked very convenient by the
star<00:02:32.470> Polaris<00:02:32.790> this<00:02:33.790> axis<00:02:34.360> of<00:02:34.480> the<00:02:34.660> mount<00:02:34.870> is

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349 
star Polaris this axis of the mount is

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:37.259 
star Polaris this axis of the mount is
pointing<00:02:35.860> straight<00:02:36.099> up<00:02:36.370> to<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.060> North

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:37.269 
pointing straight up to the North

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:39.119 
pointing straight up to the North
celestial<00:02:37.750> Pole<00:02:38.019> and<00:02:38.650> when<00:02:38.799> you've<00:02:38.920> done<00:02:39.069> that

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:39.129 
celestial Pole and when you've done that

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:40.380 
celestial Pole and when you've done that
properly<00:02:39.640> it's<00:02:39.879> called<00:02:40.030> polar<00:02:40.239> alignment

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
properly it's called polar alignment

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:42.420 
properly it's called polar alignment
once<00:02:40.959> that's<00:02:41.140> done<00:02:41.349> the<00:02:41.799> telescope<00:02:42.250> will

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
once that's done the telescope will

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.699 
once that's done the telescope will
track<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:42.909> motion<00:02:43.269> of<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.480> sky<00:02:43.750> with<00:02:44.379> just

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
track the motion of the sky with just

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.339 
track the motion of the sky with just
one<00:02:44.950> motion<00:02:45.730> even<00:02:46.480> with<00:02:46.780> very<00:02:47.019> high<00:02:47.290> quality

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
one motion even with very high quality

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.369 
one motion even with very high quality
mounts<00:02:48.069> like<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.640> it<00:02:49.030> is<00:02:49.299> also<00:02:49.540> necessary<00:02:49.989> to

00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:50.379 
mounts like this it is also necessary to

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:52.229 
mounts like this it is also necessary to
do<00:02:50.590> something<00:02:50.920> called<00:02:51.069> Auto<00:02:51.250> guiding<00:02:51.879> as<00:02:52.000> well

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
do something called Auto guiding as well

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:54.839 
do something called Auto guiding as well
this<00:02:52.900> is<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.170> main<00:02:53.349> imaging<00:02:53.799> camera<00:02:54.250> with<00:02:54.760> the

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
this is the main imaging camera with the

this is the main imaging camera with the
cables<00:02:55.269> coming<00:02:55.510> out<00:02:55.629> here<00:02:55.989> and<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.500> one

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
cables coming out here and the one

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.710 
cables coming out here and the one
sticking<00:02:57.489> as<00:02:57.670> little<00:02:58.030> black<00:02:58.269> like<00:02:58.599> an

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
sticking as little black like an

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.259 
sticking as little black like an
eyepiece<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.739> actually<00:03:00.220> the<00:03:00.489> auto<00:03:00.730> guiding

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
eyepiece is actually the auto guiding

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.420 
eyepiece is actually the auto guiding
camera<00:03:01.750> now<00:03:02.200> what's<00:03:02.410> happening<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.069> that

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
camera now what's happening is that

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.650 
camera now what's happening is that
whilst<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:05.200> CCD<00:03:06.160> imaging<00:03:06.640> camera<00:03:07.120> is<00:03:07.390> taking

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
the picture through the main telescope

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.180 
the picture through the main telescope
this<00:03:10.209> auto<00:03:10.780> guiding<00:03:11.260> camera<00:03:11.530> is<00:03:11.590> also<00:03:11.829> looking

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
this auto guiding camera is also looking

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.430 
this auto guiding camera is also looking
through<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.549> telescope<00:03:12.730> but<00:03:13.150> just<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.750> small

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
through the telescope but just a small

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.830 
through the telescope but just a small
reference<00:03:14.920> star<00:03:15.549> and<00:03:15.819> that's<00:03:16.450> taking

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
reference star and that's taking

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.259 
reference star and that's taking
exposures<00:03:17.410> every<00:03:17.769> five<00:03:18.130> or<00:03:18.400> six<00:03:18.639> seconds<00:03:19.030> and

exposures every five or six seconds and

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.330 
exposures every five or six seconds and
if<00:03:19.660> it<00:03:19.750> sees<00:03:19.959> any<00:03:20.139> deviation<00:03:20.859> of<00:03:20.950> that<00:03:21.069> guide

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
if it sees any deviation of that guide

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
corrective move the telescope itself is

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.670 
corrective move the telescope itself is

a 10 inch Ricci crashing telescope the

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.460 
a 10 inch Ricci crashing telescope the
light<00:03:32.859> comes<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.370> through<00:03:33.400> this<00:03:33.849> open<00:03:34.329> tube<00:03:34.630> is

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
light comes in through this open tube is

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.500 
light comes in through this open tube is
collected<00:03:36.069> by<00:03:36.099> the<00:03:36.250> mirror<00:03:36.609> then<00:03:37.030> bounces

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
collected by the mirror then bounces

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.289 
collected by the mirror then bounces
back<00:03:37.780> up<00:03:38.019> to<00:03:38.319> the<00:03:38.590> second<00:03:39.069> hyperbolic<00:03:40.000> mirror

00:03:40.289 --> 00:03:40.299

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.720 
back up to the second hyperbolic mirror
just<00:03:40.930> inside<00:03:41.410> there<00:03:41.769> the<00:03:42.190> light<00:03:42.400> then<00:03:42.579> goes

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
just inside there the light then goes

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.819 
just inside there the light then goes
back<00:03:43.060> down<00:03:43.419> the<00:03:43.660> tube<00:03:43.900> again<00:03:44.200> through<00:03:44.470> a<00:03:44.500> hole

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
back down the tube again through a hole

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.220 
back down the tube again through a hole
in<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.130> primary<00:03:45.280> mirror<00:03:45.609> out<00:03:46.239> to<00:03:46.780> all<00:03:47.079> the

in the primary mirror out to all the
instrumentation<00:03:47.950> on<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.130> back<00:03:48.310> then<00:03:49.030> here<00:03:49.660> is

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
instrumentation on the back then here is

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.680 
instrumentation on the back then here is
an<00:03:50.410> electronic<00:03:51.010> focuser<00:03:51.579> the<00:03:51.970> mirror<00:03:52.269> itself

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
an electronic focuser the mirror itself

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.129 
an electronic focuser the mirror itself
is<00:03:52.840> fixed<00:03:53.260> in<00:03:53.380> place<00:03:53.590> so<00:03:54.549> to<00:03:54.609> focus<00:03:55.540> the<00:03:55.660> camera

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
is fixed in place so to focus the camera

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.110 
is fixed in place so to focus the camera
you<00:03:56.410> have<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.709> have<00:03:56.859> a<00:03:56.889> mechanism<00:03:57.160> by<00:03:57.639> the

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
you have to have a mechanism by the

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.849 
you have to have a mechanism by the
electronic<00:03:58.510> focuser<00:03:59.079> that<00:03:59.440> can<00:03:59.590> literally

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
electronic focuser that can literally

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:01.619 
electronic focuser that can literally
move<00:04:00.099> the<00:04:00.370> camera<00:04:00.730> backwards<00:04:01.090> and<00:04:01.209> forwards

00:04:01.619 --> 00:04:01.629 
move the camera backwards and forwards

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.289 
move the camera backwards and forwards
then<00:04:02.349> we<00:04:02.500> have<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:03.280> filter<00:04:03.700> wheel<00:04:03.879> this

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:04.299 
then we have the filter wheel this

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:07.050 
then we have the filter wheel this
circular<00:04:04.840> housing<00:04:05.379> here<00:04:05.799> has<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.430> rotating

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
circular housing here has a rotating

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.900 
circular housing here has a rotating
carousel<00:04:07.540> inside<00:04:08.319> with<00:04:08.739> multiple<00:04:09.400> filters

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
carousel inside with multiple filters

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.520 
carousel inside with multiple filters
with<00:04:10.389> other<00:04:10.540> cameras<00:04:10.959> our<00:04:11.079> black<00:04:11.230> and<00:04:11.379> white

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
with other cameras our black and white

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:13.500 
with other cameras our black and white
camera<00:04:11.799> we<00:04:12.099> take<00:04:12.280> images<00:04:12.489> through<00:04:12.879> multiple

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
camera we take images through multiple

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.199 
camera we take images through multiple
filters<00:04:13.989> to<00:04:14.650> combine<00:04:15.099> to<00:04:15.639> produce<00:04:15.790> a<00:04:16.030> color

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
filters to combine to produce a color

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.509 
filters to combine to produce a color
image<00:04:16.389> so<00:04:16.690> we<00:04:16.780> have<00:04:16.930> to<00:04:17.019> have<00:04:17.199> a<00:04:17.229> mechanism<00:04:17.530> for

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
image so we have to have a mechanism for

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.400 
image so we have to have a mechanism for
moving<00:04:18.880> these<00:04:19.239> different<00:04:19.570> filters<00:04:19.930> into<00:04:20.139> the

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
moving these different filters into the

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.020 
moving these different filters into the
field<00:04:20.680> of<00:04:20.859> view<00:04:21.010> of<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.160> camera

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
field of view of the camera

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.520 
field of view of the camera
one<00:04:22.360> last<00:04:22.600> thing<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:22.930> feel<00:04:23.140> that<00:04:23.290> we<00:04:23.350> haven't

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530 
one last thing I feel that we haven't

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.200 
one last thing I feel that we haven't
explained<00:04:23.950> is<00:04:24.220> the<00:04:24.340> Pentek<00:04:24.760> thing<00:04:25.000> on<00:04:25.120> the

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:25.210 
explained is the Pentek thing on the

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.880 
explained is the Pentek thing on the
shore<00:04:25.540> yeah<00:04:25.900> there's<00:04:26.110> the<00:04:26.230> small<00:04:26.440> scope<00:04:26.710> on

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:26.890 
shore yeah there's the small scope on

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.350 
shore yeah there's the small scope on
the<00:04:26.980> top<00:04:27.160> had<00:04:27.310> this<00:04:27.400> a<00:04:27.460> long<00:04:27.730> time<00:04:28.060> now<00:04:28.270> I've

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
the top had this a long time now I've

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:29.460 
the top had this a long time now I've
got<00:04:28.480> a<00:04:28.510> lot<00:04:28.630> of<00:04:28.660> affection<00:04:29.200> for<00:04:29.320> this

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
got a lot of affection for this

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.260 
got a lot of affection for this
telescope<00:04:30.010> it's<00:04:30.280> what<00:04:30.640> we<00:04:30.730> call<00:04:30.880> a<00:04:30.910> three-inch

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:31.270 
telescope it's what we call a three-inch

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.500 
telescope it's what we call a three-inch
refractor<00:04:31.990> the<00:04:32.470> field<00:04:32.740> of<00:04:32.950> view<00:04:33.190> of<00:04:33.460> this<00:04:34.240> one

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:34.510 
refractor the field of view of this one

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.300 
refractor the field of view of this one
compared<00:04:34.930> to<00:04:34.960> that<00:04:35.140> is<00:04:35.230> much<00:04:35.410> wider<00:04:35.710> things

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
compared to that is much wider things

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.560 
compared to that is much wider things
like<00:04:36.520> for<00:04:36.670> example<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.060> Andromeda<00:04:37.540> galaxy

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570 
like for example the Andromeda galaxy

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.810 
like for example the Andromeda galaxy
just<00:04:38.140> wouldn't<00:04:38.500> fit<00:04:38.740> on<00:04:38.890> the<00:04:39.040> chip<00:04:39.310> in<00:04:39.580> its

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
just wouldn't fit on the chip in its

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.970 
just wouldn't fit on the chip in its
entirety<00:04:40.480> with<00:04:40.750> the<00:04:40.840> main<00:04:41.020> telescope<00:04:41.530> so<00:04:41.770> if

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
entirety with the main telescope so if

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.830 
entirety with the main telescope so if
we're<00:04:42.610> going<00:04:42.700> to<00:04:42.760> image<00:04:43.030> comets<00:04:43.480> or<00:04:43.630> things

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
we're going to image comets or things

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.020 
we're going to image comets or things
like<00:04:43.930> that<00:04:44.050> or<00:04:44.350> wide<00:04:44.590> field<00:04:44.920> targets<00:04:45.520> things

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
like that or wide field targets things

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.940 
like that or wide field targets things
like<00:04:46.120> the<00:04:46.240> North<00:04:46.450> American<00:04:46.960> nebula<00:04:47.200> now<00:04:47.770> could

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
like the North American nebula now could

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.170 
like the North American nebula now could
you<00:04:48.040> take<00:04:48.160> the<00:04:48.280> camera<00:04:48.460> off<00:04:48.670> and<00:04:48.700> switch<00:04:49.000> to

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
you take the camera off and switch to

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.660 
you take the camera off and switch to
this<00:04:49.300> one<00:04:49.470> the<00:04:50.470> telescope<00:04:50.980> and<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.190> mount<00:04:51.430> are

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:51.670 
this one the telescope and the mount are

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.430 
this one the telescope and the mount are
linked<00:04:51.970> to<00:04:52.210> what<00:04:52.480> we<00:04:52.540> call<00:04:52.690> planetarium

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
linked to what we call planetarium

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.990 
linked to what we call planetarium
software<00:04:53.680> you<00:04:54.190> can<00:04:54.310> see<00:04:54.490> on<00:04:54.610> the<00:04:54.700> screen<00:04:54.940> this

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
software you can see on the screen this

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.340 
software you can see on the screen this
is<00:04:55.060> a<00:04:55.150> representation<00:04:55.780> of<00:04:56.050> what's<00:04:56.200> actually

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
is a representation of what's actually

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:58.440 
is a representation of what's actually
in<00:04:56.620> the<00:04:56.740> sky<00:04:56.920> at<00:04:57.100> the<00:04:57.160> moment<00:04:57.580> the<00:04:57.820> crosshairs

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
in the sky at the moment the crosshairs

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.060 
in the sky at the moment the crosshairs
show<00:04:58.960> you<00:04:59.020> where<00:04:59.230> the<00:04:59.350> telescope's<00:04:59.770> actually

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
show you where the telescope's actually

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:02.010 
show you where the telescope's actually
pointing<00:05:00.580> at<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.790> moment<00:05:01.180> so<00:05:01.390> if<00:05:01.690> we<00:05:01.840> wanted

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
disappointment when your telescope

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.230 
disappointment when your telescope
points<00:05:26.320> a<00:05:26.470> target<00:05:27.160> first<00:05:27.430> time<00:05:27.790> and<00:05:28.000> every

points a target first time and every

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.690 
points a target first time and every
time<00:05:28.270> it's<00:05:28.750> a<00:05:28.840> really<00:05:29.169> good<00:05:29.290> thing<00:05:29.640> for<00:05:30.640> the

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:30.700 
time it's a really good thing for the

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.970 
time it's a really good thing for the
people<00:05:30.880> starting<00:05:31.450> out<00:05:31.570> take<00:05:32.020> heart<00:05:32.380> because

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
people starting out take heart because

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.830 
people starting out take heart because
you<00:05:33.190> don't<00:05:33.460> need<00:05:33.669> this<00:05:33.850> level<00:05:34.120> of<00:05:34.330> equipment

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
you don't need this level of equipment

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.800 
you don't need this level of equipment
to<00:05:35.320> to<00:05:35.919> get<00:05:36.100> good<00:05:36.280> results<00:05:36.790> and<00:05:36.970> we<00:05:37.660> also

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:37.810 
to to get good results and we also

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.480 
to to get good results and we also
wouldn't<00:05:38.080> recommend<00:05:38.500> that<00:05:38.830> you<00:05:38.950> just<00:05:39.160> went

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
wouldn't recommend that you just went

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:40.890 
wouldn't recommend that you just went
out<00:05:39.669> and<00:05:39.729> bought<00:05:40.000> this<00:05:40.180> equipment<00:05:40.690> because

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
out and bought this equipment because

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.600 
out and bought this equipment because
there<00:05:41.050> is<00:05:41.200> a<00:05:41.229> fairly<00:05:41.680> steep<00:05:41.919> learning<00:05:42.160> curve

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
there is a fairly steep learning curve

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.520 
there is a fairly steep learning curve
but<00:05:43.000> once<00:05:43.240> you<00:05:43.450> get<00:05:43.600> to<00:05:43.660> this<00:05:43.960> stage<00:05:44.260> the

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:44.530 
but once you get to this stage the

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.530 
but once you get to this stage the
learning<00:05:44.890> curve<00:05:45.100> just<00:05:45.130> goes<00:05:45.550> flat<00:05:45.910> because

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540 
learning curve just goes flat because

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:47.969 
learning curve just goes flat because
you're<00:05:46.840> doing<00:05:47.110> the<00:05:47.169> same<00:05:47.440> thing<00:05:47.710> every<00:05:47.950> night

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
you're doing the same thing every night

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.700 
you're doing the same thing every night
we<00:05:48.850> recommend<00:05:49.390> starting<00:05:49.540> with<00:05:49.870> a<00:05:49.990> short<00:05:50.290> focal

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
we recommend starting with a short focal

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:52.590 
we recommend starting with a short focal
length<00:05:50.860> scope<00:05:51.130> like<00:05:51.430> this<00:05:51.790> because<00:05:52.419> you<00:05:52.479> can

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.600 
length scope like this because you can

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:54.360 
length scope like this because you can
attach<00:05:52.810> it<00:05:52.840> the<00:05:53.110> SLO<00:05:53.440> on<00:05:53.530> the<00:05:53.620> back<00:05:53.770> is<00:05:53.919> easy<00:05:54.100> to

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
attach it the SLO on the back is easy to

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.030 
attach it the SLO on the back is easy to
focus<00:05:54.960> it's<00:05:55.960> just<00:05:56.169> a<00:05:56.260> generally<00:05:56.650> easy

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.040 
focus it's just a generally easy

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.950 
focus it's just a generally easy
telescope<00:05:57.790> you<00:05:57.880> have<00:05:58.000> a<00:05:58.030> nice<00:05:58.180> wide<00:05:58.479> field<00:05:58.840> of

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
telescope you have a nice wide field of

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.540 
telescope you have a nice wide field of
view<00:05:59.140> so<00:05:59.380> you<00:05:59.470> not<00:05:59.620> having<00:05:59.979> trouble<00:06:00.370> finding

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:00.550 
view so you not having trouble finding

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.450 
view so you not having trouble finding
targets<00:06:01.270> and<00:06:01.840> most<00:06:02.020> people<00:06:02.380> do<00:06:02.530> have<00:06:02.560> a<00:06:02.770> DSLR

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:03.460 
targets and most people do have a DSLR

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.280 
targets and most people do have a DSLR
camera<00:06:03.940> and<00:06:04.120> they<00:06:04.180> are<00:06:04.240> great<00:06:04.570> for<00:06:04.870> imaging

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.290 
camera and they are great for imaging

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:07.500 
camera and they are great for imaging
because<00:06:05.770> you<00:06:06.430> just<00:06:06.640> remove<00:06:06.940> the<00:06:07.120> lens<00:06:07.300> from

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510 
because you just remove the lens from

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.300 
because you just remove the lens from
the<00:06:07.600> DSLR<00:06:08.260> put<00:06:08.500> a<00:06:08.530> small<00:06:08.830> inexpensive

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.310 
the DSLR put a small inexpensive

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:11.400 
the DSLR put a small inexpensive
attachment<00:06:10.300> that<00:06:10.419> allows<00:06:10.479> you<00:06:10.840> to<00:06:10.870> couple<00:06:11.320> the

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
attachment that allows you to couple the

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:13.830 
attachment that allows you to couple the
DSLR<00:06:11.830> to<00:06:11.979> a<00:06:12.010> telescope<00:06:12.550> and<00:06:13.330> then<00:06:13.450> as<00:06:13.600> for<00:06:13.750> the

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:13.840 
DSLR to a telescope and then as for the

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.900 
DSLR to a telescope and then as for the
mount<00:06:14.080> itself<00:06:14.560> you<00:06:14.979> can<00:06:15.130> buy<00:06:15.280> man<00:06:15.520> called<00:06:15.820> a

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:15.910 
mount itself you can buy man called a

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.170 
mount itself you can buy man called a
sky<00:06:16.150> watcher<00:06:16.660> a<00:06:16.860> gq5<00:06:17.860> which<00:06:18.580> is<00:06:18.700> the<00:06:18.820> man<00:06:19.000> that

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
sky watcher a gq5 which is the man that

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.300 
sky watcher a gq5 which is the man that
I<00:06:19.210> always<00:06:19.510> recommend<00:06:20.290> to<00:06:20.440> people<00:06:20.830> starting

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
I always recommend to people starting

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.580 
I always recommend to people starting
out<00:06:21.460> it's<00:06:22.180> a<00:06:22.330> smaller<00:06:22.660> version<00:06:22.990> of<00:06:23.440> this

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:23.590 
out it's a smaller version of this

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:25.830 
out it's a smaller version of this
equatorial<00:06:24.220> mount<00:06:24.250> used<00:06:24.640> on<00:06:24.760> a<00:06:24.790> tripod<00:06:25.060> but

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
equatorial mount used on a tripod but

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:27.180 
equatorial mount used on a tripod but
the<00:06:25.960> idea<00:06:26.260> is<00:06:26.320> you<00:06:26.410> could<00:06:26.620> attach<00:06:26.890> a<00:06:27.070> small

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:27.190 
the idea is you could attach a small

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:29.370 
the idea is you could attach a small
reflector<00:06:27.820> to<00:06:27.970> that<00:06:28.150> you<00:06:28.360> can<00:06:28.479> attach<00:06:28.720> a<00:06:28.810> DSLR

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:29.380 
reflector to that you can attach a DSLR

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.200 
reflector to that you can attach a DSLR
to<00:06:29.470> the<00:06:29.560> back<00:06:29.770> you<00:06:30.310> can<00:06:30.430> pull<00:06:30.640> a<00:06:30.669> line<00:06:30.940> that's

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:31.210 
to the back you can pull a line that's

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.790 
to the back you can pull a line that's
got<00:06:31.390> an<00:06:31.450> inbuilt<00:06:31.750> polar<00:06:32.110> long<00:06:32.260> scopes<00:06:32.560> you<00:06:32.650> get

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:32.800 
got an inbuilt polar long scopes you get

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.780 
got an inbuilt polar long scopes you get
good<00:06:32.979> polar<00:06:33.250> line

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:33.790 
good polar line

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.730 
good polar line
about<00:06:34.120> ten<00:06:34.360> minutes<00:06:34.720> if<00:06:34.900> that<00:06:35.140> if<00:06:35.380> you<00:06:35.590> can<00:06:35.710> use

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:35.740 
about ten minutes if that if you can use

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.900 
about ten minutes if that if you can use
an<00:06:35.980> auto<00:06:36.130> guider

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
an auto guider

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:38.970 
an auto guider
perhaps<00:06:37.330> with<00:06:37.510> a<00:06:37.540> second<00:06:37.960> guiding<00:06:38.380> telescope

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
perhaps with a second guiding telescope

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.470 
perhaps with a second guiding telescope
it's<00:06:39.610> going<00:06:39.790> to<00:06:39.850> add<00:06:39.940> a<00:06:39.970> little<00:06:40.120> bit<00:06:40.300> to<00:06:40.390> the
