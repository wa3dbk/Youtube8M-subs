00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:46.830
 f 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.760
 approached christmas 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.990
 that's it either 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.610
 why him 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.580
 that's it 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.210
 why buy unequaled at the risk of life 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.200
 I am ready to die if necessary 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 the call is not at all handing over cuts 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.120
 the game understands why 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.750
 other 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.750
 good I think 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.920
 Why 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.530
 we are waiting for him 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.770
 Why 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.870
 I do not understand why 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.870
 the context does not lend itself to it 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.860
 in the notebook 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:31.039
 those who are covered 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.239
 we lost the site 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:42.189
 to repair it 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.069
 at least if we can 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:47.069
 but of course the officer in charge of repair has disappeared 

00:02:52.059 --> 00:02:53.759
 find it 

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:56.759
 we realize short-range seems to be fatally 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:11.479
 find the repairer so that he creates by radio long and short range the 

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:14.479
 As fast as possible 

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.749
 then expressly or not on purpose 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:33.429
 considering others to find subsidies 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.029
 his capture 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.870
 I was in the hut of the league map on the rise
