00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
when it comes to traditional cancer

when it comes to traditional cancer
treatments<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.520> chemo<00:00:02.850> and<00:00:02.970> radiation<00:00:03.500> why

treatments the chemo and radiation why

treatments the chemo and radiation why
does<00:00:04.680> it<00:00:04.859> seem<00:00:05.130> like<00:00:06.379> nutrition<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.830> sort<00:00:08.610> of

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
does it seem like nutrition is sort of

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.270 
does it seem like nutrition is sort of
an<00:00:08.760> afterthought<00:00:09.269> when<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.660> comes<00:00:09.870> to<00:00:10.280> those

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
an afterthought when it comes to those

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.890 
an afterthought when it comes to those
treatments<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:11.790> mean<00:00:11.940> I<00:00:11.969> have<00:00:12.150> I've<00:00:12.719> known

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
treatments I mean I have I've known

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.270 
treatments I mean I have I've known
people<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.290> I'm<00:00:13.349> sure<00:00:13.380> you<00:00:13.620> can<00:00:13.799> say<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.099> same

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
people and I'm sure you can say the same

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.680 
people and I'm sure you can say the same
that<00:00:14.429> it<00:00:14.580> you<00:00:14.849> know<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.150> food<00:00:15.330> they<00:00:15.450> eat<00:00:15.480> in

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
that it you know the food they eat in

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.000 
that it you know the food they eat in
the<00:00:15.809> hospital<00:00:16.199> while<00:00:16.379> they're<00:00:16.529> receiving

the hospital while they're receiving

the hospital while they're receiving
these<00:00:17.100> treatments<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:18.539> food<00:00:18.779> that<00:00:18.930> they<00:00:19.020> eat

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
these treatments the food that they eat

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.290 
these treatments the food that they eat
at<00:00:19.320> home<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.800> not<00:00:20.550> giving<00:00:20.850> getting<00:00:21.210> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
at home and not giving getting the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.359 
at home and not giving getting the
instruction<00:00:21.810> by<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:21.990> physicians<00:00:22.650> to<00:00:22.740> not<00:00:23.100> eat

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
instruction by the physicians to not eat

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.460 
instruction by the physicians to not eat
the<00:00:24.029> pizza<00:00:24.240> and<00:00:24.630> things<00:00:24.810> like<00:00:24.960> that<00:00:25.019> why<00:00:25.289> does

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
the pizza and things like that why does

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.279 
the pizza and things like that why does
that<00:00:25.500> seem<00:00:25.830> to<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.849> still<00:00:27.090> a<00:00:27.420> little<00:00:28.019> bit<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.199> an

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
that seem to be still a little bit of an

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.560 
that seem to be still a little bit of an
afterthought<00:00:28.710> I<00:00:29.039> think<00:00:29.910> actually<00:00:30.119> that

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
afterthought I think actually that

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.580 
afterthought I think actually that
there's<00:00:30.869> a<00:00:31.529> couple<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.189> parallel<00:00:32.610> universes

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
there's a couple of parallel universes

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.799 
there's a couple of parallel universes
that<00:00:34.590> we<00:00:34.710> live<00:00:34.920> in<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:36.030> of<00:00:36.149> them<00:00:36.360> is<00:00:36.570> the

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
that we live in and one of them is the

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.369 
that we live in and one of them is the
allopathic<00:00:37.520> oncology<00:00:38.520> universe<00:00:38.940> and<00:00:39.379> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
allopathic oncology universe and the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.170 
allopathic oncology universe and the
training<00:00:40.829> that<00:00:40.980> goes<00:00:41.040> into<00:00:41.640> being<00:00:42.030> an

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
training that goes into being an

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.840 
training that goes into being an
oncologist<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.050> is<00:00:43.379> quite<00:00:43.860> substantial<00:00:44.670> and

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
oncologist is is quite substantial and

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.200 
oncologist is is quite substantial and
it's<00:00:45.539> mostly<00:00:46.020> focused<00:00:46.469> on<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:47.219> various<00:00:47.670> forms

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
it's mostly focused on the various forms

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.350 
it's mostly focused on the various forms
of<00:00:48.390> chemotherapy<00:00:49.340> better<00:00:50.340> available<00:00:51.030> for

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
of chemotherapy better available for

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.209 
of chemotherapy better available for
different<00:00:51.780> types<00:00:52.050> of<00:00:52.289> cancer<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:52.920> it's<00:00:53.100> a

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
different types of cancer so it's a

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.569 
different types of cancer so it's a
pharmaceutical<00:00:53.730> II<00:00:54.030> based<00:00:54.289> training<00:00:55.579> there

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
pharmaceutical II based training there

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:58.549 
pharmaceutical II based training there
is<00:00:56.610> no<00:00:56.940> nutritional<00:00:57.449> training<00:00:57.899> that

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
is no nutritional training that

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.069 
is no nutritional training that
oncologists<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.460> at<00:00:59.940> all<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.660> fact<00:01:00.809> there's

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
oncologists get at all in fact there's

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.060 
oncologists get at all in fact there's
virtually<00:01:01.800> no<00:01:02.129> training<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:03.030> any

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
virtually no training that just any

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.710 
virtually no training that just any
family<00:01:05.070> physician<00:01:05.489> gets<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.150> think<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.540> maybe

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
family physician gets I think it's maybe

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.300 
family physician gets I think it's maybe
about<00:01:06.900> four<00:01:07.350> hours<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.920> their<00:01:08.040> entire

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
about four hours and their entire

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.300 
about four hours and their entire
medical<00:01:09.180> training<00:01:09.840> career<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.890> it's<00:01:11.040> just<00:01:11.100> not

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
medical training career so it's just not

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.550 
medical training career so it's just not
not<00:01:11.729> part<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.030> their<00:01:12.180> mindset<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.049> not<00:01:13.229> part

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
not part of their mindset it's not part

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
not part of their mindset it's not part
of<00:01:13.650> what<00:01:13.920> they<00:01:14.040> learned<00:01:14.280> in<00:01:14.549> school<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.119> it's

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
of what they learned in school and it's

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.109 
of what they learned in school and it's
not<00:01:15.600> something<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.729> obviously<00:01:17.729> it's<00:01:17.939> not

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
not something that obviously it's not

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:21.200 
not something that obviously it's not
something<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.630> they<00:01:19.110> would<00:01:19.640> reach<00:01:20.640> for<00:01:21.000> in

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
something that they would reach for in

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.899 
something that they would reach for in
their<00:01:21.360> knowledge<00:01:21.509> base<00:01:22.250> in<00:01:23.250> our<00:01:23.430> parallel

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
their knowledge base in our parallel

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.840 
their knowledge base in our parallel
universe<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.630> one<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:24.810> reside<00:01:25.380> in<00:01:25.850> we're

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
universe the one I reside in we're

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.440 
universe the one I reside in we're
taught<00:01:27.180> that<00:01:27.210> you<00:01:27.810> know<00:01:27.990> everything<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.560> I

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
taught that you know everything as I

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.370 
taught that you know everything as I
mentioned<00:01:30.450> earlier<00:01:30.720> everything<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.290> know

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
mentioned earlier everything you know

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.890 
mentioned earlier everything you know
you<00:01:31.439> put<00:01:31.979> in<00:01:32.250> your<00:01:32.700> mouth<00:01:32.880> becomes<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.600> part<00:01:33.840> of

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
you put in your mouth becomes a part of

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.090 
you put in your mouth becomes a part of
who<00:01:34.049> you<00:01:34.110> are<00:01:34.729> physically<00:01:35.729> maybe<00:01:37.100> virtually

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
who you are physically maybe virtually

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.740 
who you are physically maybe virtually
as<00:01:38.220> well<00:01:38.430> I'm<00:01:38.579> not<00:01:38.729> sure<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.240> certainly

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
as well I'm not sure but certainly

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.039 
as well I'm not sure but certainly
physically<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:42.180> we<00:01:42.540> have<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.840> pay

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
physically and so we have to pay

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.859 
physically and so we have to pay
exquisite<00:01:43.860> attention<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.790> what<00:01:45.270> we<00:01:45.390> put<00:01:45.630> in

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
exquisite attention to what we put in

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.600 
exquisite attention to what we put in
our<00:01:45.990> mouths<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:46.470> it's<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:47.009> not<00:01:47.159> part<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.490> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
our mouths but it's just not part of the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.679 
our mouths but it's just not part of the
way<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.509> other<00:01:48.720> universe<00:01:49.200> thinks<00:01:50.479> so<00:01:51.479> put

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
way the other universe thinks so put

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.600 
way the other universe thinks so put
those<00:01:51.810> two<00:01:51.869> together<00:01:52.200> and<00:01:52.470> based<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.369> what<00:01:53.520> you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
those two together and based on what you

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.370 
those two together and based on what you
said<00:01:53.820> how<00:01:54.000> important<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.630> diet<00:01:54.960> when<00:01:55.170> your

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
said how important is diet when your

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.139 
said how important is diet when your
your<00:01:56.009> body<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.520> going<00:01:56.700> through<00:01:56.820> those

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
your body is going through those

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.490
