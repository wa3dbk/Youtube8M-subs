00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.390
 prizes in nominations 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.679
 data on the number 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.699
 because the statements are not known 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.699
 better in early 2009 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.480
 hardly new accomplishments of justice 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.090
 main character 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:39.320
 but born for high society 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.010
 the manager would have such a wide choice of each 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.010
 of in an hour so i'm quite capable 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.350
 Gruzdev before he was 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.159
 if a person has his face 

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.700
 but all this will change soon 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.010
 especially if you are people with me 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.760
 but this is not people 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.760
 he is a military doctrine and threatens 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.000
 real woman rules 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.200
 she protected them 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.230
 for millions 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:11.830
 radio box 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.830
 something I think animals 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.740
 if the manager is equal 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.760
 so not yet 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.690
 we can be slaves 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.640
 updated highs 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.640
 Alexandra 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.810
 in this year 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.990
 however it does not mean that me 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.700
 and spring doubt 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.550
 later she herself she 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:08.179
 to another world 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.179
 by building 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.599
