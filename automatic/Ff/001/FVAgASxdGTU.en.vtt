them<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.740> lot<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.920> tough<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.280> shine<00:01:17.520> considering

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
them a lot of tough to shine considering

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.460 
them a lot of tough to shine considering
the<00:01:18.210> matches<00:01:18.479> as<00:01:18.600> WrestleMania<00:01:18.960> were<00:01:19.229> pretty

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the matches as WrestleMania were pretty

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.010 
the matches as WrestleMania were pretty
short<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.040> most<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.970> them<00:01:21.090> below<00:01:21.360> 10<00:01:21.659> minutes

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
short and most of them below 10 minutes

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.890 
short and most of them below 10 minutes
I<00:01:22.140> believe<00:01:22.439> so<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.670> also<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.030> mean<00:01:24.210> we<00:01:24.570> saw<00:01:24.869> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
I believe so and also I mean we saw a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.450 
I believe so and also I mean we saw a
great<00:01:25.200> match<00:01:25.470> from<00:01:25.680> CM<00:01:25.950> Punk<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.340> Rey

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
great match from CM Punk and Rey

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.070 
great match from CM Punk and Rey
Mysterio<00:01:26.970> at<00:01:27.030> WrestleMania<00:01:27.600> it<00:01:27.689> was<00:01:27.810> short

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
Mysterio at WrestleMania it was short

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.609 
Mysterio at WrestleMania it was short
and<00:01:28.259> sweet<00:01:28.530> but<00:01:28.829> very<00:01:29.369> very<00:01:29.640> good<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.619> they

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
and sweet but very very good and they

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.890 
and sweet but very very good and they
could<00:01:31.890> go<00:01:32.100> much<00:01:32.700> longer<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.329> I<00:01:33.420> believe<00:01:33.750> they

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
could go much longer and I believe they

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.719 
could go much longer and I believe they
will<00:01:34.020> get<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> 20<00:01:35.009> minute<00:01:35.280> match<00:01:35.400> at

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
will get like a 20 minute match at

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
will get like a 20 minute match at
Extreme<00:01:35.759> Rules<00:01:36.180> at<00:01:36.509> least<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:37.079> compensate

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
Extreme Rules at least to compensate

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.350 
Extreme Rules at least to compensate
that<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.369> think<00:01:38.579> they<00:01:38.700> deserve<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> because

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
that and I think they deserve it because

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.660 
that and I think they deserve it because
they<00:01:39.750> are<00:01:39.900> top-notch<00:01:40.380> athletes<00:01:40.860> they<00:01:41.490> had<00:01:41.640> a

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
this much coming as well I say as a

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.759 
this much coming as well I say as a
fallout<00:04:19.299> from<00:04:19.599> WrestleMania<00:04:20.349> where<00:04:20.500> they<00:04:20.620> had

fallout from WrestleMania where they had
a<00:04:20.799> title<00:04:21.070> match<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.489> very<00:04:21.729> good<00:04:21.940> match<00:04:22.120> that<00:04:22.360> got

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
a title match a very good match that got

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.100 
a title match a very good match that got
the<00:04:22.599> crowd<00:04:22.840> going<00:04:22.900> after<00:04:23.530> being<00:04:23.740> kind<00:04:23.950> of<00:04:24.070> dead

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
the crowd going after being kind of dead

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.230 
the crowd going after being kind of dead
and<00:04:25.229> I<00:04:25.620> believe<00:04:25.860> edge<00:04:26.159> will<00:04:26.400> get<00:04:26.610> is<00:04:26.729> win<00:04:26.969> here

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
and I believe edge will get is win here

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.520 
and I believe edge will get is win here
I'm<00:04:27.389> not<00:04:27.539> sure<00:04:27.719> whether<00:04:28.020> they<00:04:28.259> are<00:04:28.289> allowed<00:04:28.500> to

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
I'm not sure whether they are allowed to

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.830 
I'm not sure whether they are allowed to
leave<00:04:28.800> the<00:04:28.949> cage<00:04:29.189> or<00:04:29.639> if<00:04:29.819> it's<00:04:30.419> the<00:04:30.509> only

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
leave the cage or if it's the only

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:34.730 
leave the cage or if it's the only
pinfall<00:04:31.409> or<00:04:31.439> so<00:04:32.099> only<00:04:32.250> escape<00:04:32.729> the<00:04:32.909> cage<00:04:33.740> one

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
pinfall or so only escape the cage one

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.860 
pinfall or so only escape the cage one
way<00:04:34.949> or<00:04:35.069> another<00:04:35.099> my<00:04:35.819> prediction<00:04:36.300> is<00:04:36.689> we're

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
way or another my prediction is we're

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.790 
way or another my prediction is we're
going<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.080> see<00:04:37.259> edge<00:04:37.469> win<00:04:38.250> here<00:04:38.669> and<00:04:39.800> finally

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
going to see edge win here and finally

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.490 
going to see edge win here and finally
we<00:04:41.729> have<00:04:42.120> Jack<00:04:43.110> Swagger<00:04:43.590> vs<00:04:43.889> randy<00:04:44.189> orton

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
we have Jack Swagger vs randy orton

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.929 
we have Jack Swagger vs randy orton
implication<00:04:46.500> because<00:04:46.620> we<00:04:47.129> have<00:04:47.370> smackdown

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:47.939 
implication because we have smackdown

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:49.700 
implication because we have smackdown
vs.<00:04:48.270> rolling<00:04:48.689> this<00:04:48.930> could<00:04:49.139> mean<00:04:49.259> we<00:04:49.409> have<00:04:49.530> both

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:49.710 
vs. rolling this could mean we have both

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.950 
vs. rolling this could mean we have both
titles<00:04:50.069> on<00:04:50.430> Raw<00:04:50.759> as<00:04:50.969> we<00:04:51.180> head<00:04:51.300> into<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:51.539> draft

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
titles on Raw as we head into the draft

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.540 
titles on Raw as we head into the draft
and<00:04:52.229> once<00:04:52.409> again<00:04:52.620> we<00:04:52.860> can<00:04:53.009> see<00:04:53.039> the<00:04:53.310> world

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
and once again we can see the world

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.010 
and once again we can see the world
heavyweight<00:04:53.759> titles<00:04:54.330> jump<00:04:54.659> around<00:04:54.960> like

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020
