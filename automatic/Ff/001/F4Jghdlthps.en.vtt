00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.570
 we have already followed in the schedules of the bovine fat seeds several results 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.019
 positives obtained by essilor santista the great idol of brazil 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.280
 our focus is to show the process of harvesting legume seeds 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.050
 as well as the stylist's hay production 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.050
 for this we went to the rock city in mato grosso do sul is the field of 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.280
 bangu seed production 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.380
 whoever accompanies us is the cooperative producer love we are facing 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.150
 he says that the large field has a fairly extensive cycle 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.280
 in the month of May and early June is the best time of flowering and is also 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.240
 when there is a greater quantity of seeds in the plant starting then the 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.000
 initial harvest period or q3 green receipts 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.950
 another team that hit the peak without realizing that fences 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.509
 the team begins the harvest reached 17 thousand so there may be machinery 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.750
 think big pottery is a large area they also protested this facility 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:25.920
 run fast by pt 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.270
 after harvesting the seeds in a drying process 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.170
 where the seeds stay for three to four days or until they are 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.230
 completely dry 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.870
 At the moment a television is taking place, ending the harvest cycle in the field 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.230
 and following the destination of the bovine fat seeds for the processing and testing of 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.370
 product quality this parity 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:56.070
 it's just having the countryside up to packaging it has to do with the producer we have 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.340
 who take extra care in the field as the Angolan national team said her mistress 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.400
 now that we know how to harvest the seeds of the 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.250
 teaching are anticipated by large 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.550
 tanaki is also a producer of legume hay shows them how it is 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.429
 made the hay exciting days 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:19.229
 the production of the film we have ours here we make cups the harvest of the seed 

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:20.399
 of the style saints 

00:02:20.399 --> 00:02:23.830
 Let's make the championship is ending, you should come here. 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.670
 she is the mayor or closed it is with three days after the harvest and three days 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:29.320
 of Sun 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.380
 she dehydrates killing a little 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.520
 the South American team they are selling dishes rancher region on the 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.569
 sake 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:40.100
 it is noteworthy that senators are large field subscribers 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.130
 is a nutritious food with up to 12% protein and also one more 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.459
 alternative in the dry season 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.829
 is one of the best alternatives that we have and cater 

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.749
 in order to understand that we sold 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:01.980
 protein that has ominous saliva and even with 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.640
 the had great accident she remains with a total of 12% protein 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.559
 nana your stop 

00:03:07.559 --> 00:03:10.559
 then compared to the end of any campaign of mine 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.980
 sanction can be considered a better food. 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.009
 quality 

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:19.219
 I'm not the one to say that we do for the ranchers any date 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.399
 It is also a matter of redeeming me that this position is not confirmed by Fernandes 

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:26.799
 took the chance that it has much wider terrain and nutritious 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:29.840
 aib for having protected as well as any other strike 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:35.069
 farmers who also want to produce hay to offer their 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.060
 animals 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.820
 Jobson also said that it is possible to lose tips but we have several 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:44.020
 producers have been trying to get us how they are doing here are 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.930
 prone to this next sar to make an area 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.100
 It is significant if the property is bring the Finn was 11 years old 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.170
 which he might have this year-round analysis nine the rooster in place 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.130
 covered 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.140
 it is that the rain recovers 

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.900
 pure - conserve the average of one year mean values ​​can 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.999
 significant causes of production 

00:04:05.999 --> 00:04:10.429
 without doubt this is a dream of great field it is possible to produce of 10 twelve 

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:15.349
 goals like this one however I will try we believe that only after the harvest 

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:20.120
 of the East Seed in the 1990s and the scourge that was making 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.840
 but that means around 1500 pounds 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.730
 I define per hectare that revolves around ten new members of 50 kilos per 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.349
 hectare this is a young boy that a lot of things stay on the ground yet 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.920
 What is the machine that can put everything together?
