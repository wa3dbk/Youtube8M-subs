00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
to the game which takes a little while

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:33.109 
to the game which takes a little while
but<00:01:31.470> here<00:01:31.740> is<00:01:31.830> a<00:01:31.860> sneak<00:01:32.130> peak<00:01:32.399> of<00:01:32.580> some<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:33.000> the

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
harvestable for grain and you can turn

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.020 
harvestable for grain and you can turn
grain<00:01:40.710> into<00:01:41.250> sacks<00:01:41.580> of<00:01:41.759> flour<00:01:43.520> which<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.759> can

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
grain into sacks of flour which you can

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:59.640 
grain into sacks of flour which you can
then<00:01:45.210> turn<00:01:45.479> into<00:01:45.869> bread

00:01:59.640 --> 00:01:59.650 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.770 

and<00:02:00.650> of<00:02:01.490> course<00:02:01.700> it<00:02:02.000> wouldn't<00:02:02.360> be<00:02:02.450> a<00:02:02.540> game<00:02:02.750> of

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
and of course it wouldn't be a game of

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.840 
and of course it wouldn't be a game of
stone<00:02:03.080> hearth<00:02:03.320> if<00:02:03.530> people<00:02:03.979> didn't<00:02:04.280> get<00:02:04.400> hungry

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
stone hearth if people didn't get hungry

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.240 
stone hearth if people didn't get hungry
and<00:02:05.060> when<00:02:05.930> they<00:02:06.080> get<00:02:06.260> hungry<00:02:06.440> they<00:02:06.650> think

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
and when they get hungry they think

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.620 
and when they get hungry they think
about<00:02:07.420> variety<00:02:08.420> in<00:02:09.170> their<00:02:09.500> food<00:02:09.800> and<00:02:10.630> that

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
about variety in their food and that

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:14.830 
about variety in their food and that
means<00:02:11.840> that<00:02:12.440> eventually<00:02:12.880> we<00:02:13.880> are<00:02:14.150> going<00:02:14.240> to

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
means that eventually we are going to

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.480 
means that eventually we are going to
need<00:02:15.080> a<00:02:15.440> source<00:02:16.400> of<00:02:16.700> meat<00:02:16.940> and<00:02:17.209> eggs
