00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.130
 you girls today I'm coming back 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.590
 to tell you about a little tip 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.540
 for those of you who like me 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.599
 use products to keep 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.369
 the loops or to wake them up if 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.200
 you have a lot of hair 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.970
 which is my case you are going 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.619
 almost every quarter of the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.380
 bottle ci explain that they already have 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.029
 almost more and so I told myself that 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.759
 I was going to reveal to you in fact the little 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.960
 tip that I discovered at the option of my 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:33.690
 tests simply 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.579
 and so it's gone so I'm sure 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.719
 that you have all had at least 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.969
 once in your life 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:43.920
 a water bomb well my secret is 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.710
 just a bottle of water which 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.899
 whatever the water and the mark chosen for 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.829
 quite simply 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.829
 moisten your hair already 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.210
 to him water all but that never done 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.970
 hold the curls actually except that 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.890
 if you want to use less 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.830
 products the advantage is that on 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.440
 hair already wet the dose of product to 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.450
 put going to be much less so in 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.550
 having hair first you go 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.410
 Use two to three times less 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:24.020
 products that cost a lot more 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:26.650
 that simple bottles of water and live 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.650
 savings 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.440
 and that's work so a little trick 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.880
 really archi simple arch that concerns 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.010
 especially mega super thick hair and 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.750
 certainly a lot because in 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.030
 having the hair that is already united in 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.979

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.700
 wet you need to put some 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.930

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.010
