greater<00:00:14.490> age<00:00:14.639> you<00:00:14.910> know<00:00:15.000> we<00:00:15.120> like<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.330> do<00:00:15.540> that

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
greater age you know we like to do that

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.070 
greater age you know we like to do that
you<00:00:15.900> don't<00:00:16.020> think<00:00:16.289> about<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:17.070> a<00:00:17.130> normal<00:00:18.080> a

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
you don't think about in a normal a

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.140 
you don't think about in a normal a
little<00:00:19.800> bit<00:00:20.039> less<00:00:20.250> traditional<00:00:20.490> than<00:00:21.000> most

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
little bit less traditional than most

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.120 
little bit less traditional than most
people<00:00:21.600> that's<00:00:21.810> looking<00:00:22.170> at<00:00:22.470> some<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
people that's looking at some of the

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.250 
people that's looking at some of the
effect<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.850> reason<00:00:24.150> we<00:00:24.269> like<00:00:24.420> table<00:00:25.050> work

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
effect the reason we like table work

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.349 
effect the reason we like table work
perturbing<00:00:25.830> work<00:00:25.980> for<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.640> tricep<00:00:27.060> is<00:00:27.240> that

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
perturbing work for the tricep is that

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.750 
perturbing work for the tricep is that
continuous<00:00:27.900> tension<00:00:28.140> on<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.439> muscle

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.850 

so<00:00:31.120> this<00:00:31.300> is<00:00:31.480> a<00:00:31.510> mimic<00:00:31.840> version<00:00:32.439> for<00:00:32.770> the

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:32.860 
so this is a mimic version for the

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.860 
so this is a mimic version for the
one-armed<00:00:33.190> dumbbell<00:00:33.430> extension<00:00:34.210> but<00:00:34.600> it's<00:00:34.750> a

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:34.870 
one-armed dumbbell extension but it's a

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:37.320 
one-armed dumbbell extension but it's a
one-armed<00:00:35.260> whooping<00:00:35.980> station<00:00:36.340> on<00:00:36.460> cable<00:00:36.970> so

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:37.330 
one-armed whooping station on cable so

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.430 
one-armed whooping station on cable so
I'm<00:00:37.390> going<00:00:37.540> to<00:00:37.570> start<00:00:37.870> off<00:00:37.960> with<00:00:38.140> a<00:00:38.230> very

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
I'm going to start off with a very

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:41.190 
I'm going to start off with a very
Orthodox<00:00:38.890> manner<00:00:39.520> the<00:00:40.330> coach<00:00:40.570> is<00:00:40.750> just<00:00:40.870> doing

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
Orthodox manner the coach is just doing

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.330 
Orthodox manner the coach is just doing
like<00:00:41.320> you<00:00:41.470> would<00:00:41.620> do<00:00:41.739> with<00:00:41.770> the<00:00:41.980> dumbbell

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
like you would do with the dumbbell

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.710 
like you would do with the dumbbell
except<00:00:42.640> they<00:00:42.760> get<00:00:42.910> a<00:00:42.940> way<00:00:43.120> better<00:00:43.360> stretch

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720 
except they get a way better stretch

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.510 
except they get a way better stretch
here<00:00:43.960> because<00:00:44.290> you<00:00:44.410> can<00:00:44.530> come<00:00:44.770> down<00:00:44.980> with

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
here because you can come down with

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.340 
here because you can come down with
tension<00:00:45.970> on<00:00:46.150> the<00:00:46.330> muscle<00:00:46.360> if<00:00:46.750> we<00:00:46.900> assume<00:00:47.140> the

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
tension on the muscle if we assume the

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.280 
tension on the muscle if we assume the
dumbbell<00:00:47.770> once<00:00:48.400> he<00:00:48.550> got<00:00:48.699> past<00:00:49.030> that<00:00:49.210> ear<00:00:50.020> level

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:50.290 
dumbbell once he got past that ear level

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.080 
dumbbell once he got past that ear level
it<00:00:50.590> would<00:00:50.680> be<00:00:50.739> all<00:00:51.010> above<00:00:51.280> the<00:00:51.430> shoulder<00:00:51.850> which

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
it would be all above the shoulder which

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.150 
it would be all above the shoulder which
would<00:00:52.270> be<00:00:52.390> able<00:00:52.449> very<00:00:52.840> stressful<00:00:53.440> huge

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
would be able very stressful huge

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.650 
would be able very stressful huge
continuous<00:00:54.760> tension<00:00:55.150> and<00:00:55.300> now<00:00:55.390> we're<00:00:55.540> going

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 
continuous tension and now we're going

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.939 
continuous tension and now we're going
to<00:00:55.720> throw<00:00:55.840> a<00:00:55.930> little<00:00:56.080> rattlesnake<00:00:56.500> in<00:00:56.860> it

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
to throw a little rattlesnake in it

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.250 
to throw a little rattlesnake in it
coach<00:00:57.430> is<00:00:57.610> going<00:00:57.760> to<00:00:57.820> turn<00:00:58.030> to<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.269> side<00:00:58.480> which

00:00:59.250 --> 00:00:59.260 
coach is going to turn to the side which

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.310 
coach is going to turn to the side which
creates<00:00:59.710> a<00:00:59.800> completely<00:01:00.519> different<00:01:00.699> vector<00:01:01.320> on

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
creates a completely different vector on

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.590 
creates a completely different vector on
the<00:01:02.559> dress

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.200 

back<00:01:08.230> here<00:01:08.530> so<00:01:09.010> just<00:01:09.040> by<00:01:09.400> changing<00:01:09.430> from

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
back here so just by changing from

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.510 
back here so just by changing from
standing<00:01:10.710> north<00:01:11.710> to<00:01:11.920> south<00:01:12.160> she's<00:01:12.340> now

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
standing north to south she's now

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.810 
standing north to south she's now
standing<00:01:12.970> east<00:01:13.210> to<00:01:13.360> west<00:01:13.570> and<00:01:14.050> we<00:01:14.230> got<00:01:14.380> the

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
standing east to west and we got the

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.450 
standing east to west and we got the
pulley<00:01:16.830> which<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:17.950> a<00:01:18.040> totally<00:01:18.430> different

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
pulley which is a totally different

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.750 
pulley which is a totally different
emphasis<00:01:19.240> on<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.510> tricep<00:01:20.020> so<00:01:20.650> that's<00:01:21.430> two

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
emphasis on the tricep so that's two

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.920 
emphasis on the tricep so that's two
versions<00:01:22.330> but<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.140> one-arm<00:01:24.240> rope<00:01:25.240> locally

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
versions but the one-arm rope locally

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.200 
versions but the one-arm rope locally
broken<00:01:26.290> extension<00:01:26.860> one<00:01:27.100> are<00:01:27.250> two<00:01:27.850> different

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
broken extension one are two different

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.730 
broken extension one are two different
versions<00:01:28.360> with<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.900> two<00:01:29.260> totally<00:01:29.710> different

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:29.740 
versions with the two totally different

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.040 
versions with the two totally different
effects<00:01:30.340> how<00:01:30.490> that<00:01:30.670> goes<00:01:31.120> yeah<00:01:31.360> turning<00:01:31.810> to

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
effects how that goes yeah turning to

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.510 
effects how that goes yeah turning to
the<00:01:32.140> side<00:01:32.320> like<00:01:32.560> that<00:01:32.740> that's<00:01:32.950> incredible<00:01:33.190> a

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
the side like that that's incredible a

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.550 
the side like that that's incredible a
difference<00:01:33.940> in<00:01:34.510> hates<00:01:34.810> in<00:01:35.050> in<00:01:35.320> the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
difference in hates in in the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.260 
difference in hates in in the
contraction<00:01:36.010> at<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.400> top<00:01:36.610> much<00:01:36.850> more<00:01:37.060> peak

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
contraction at the top much more peak

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.260 
contraction at the top much more peak
contraction<00:01:37.740> as<00:01:38.740> the<00:01:39.040> pulleys<00:01:39.940> trying<00:01:40.210> to

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
contraction as the pulleys trying to

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.999 
contraction as the pulleys trying to
pull<00:01:40.509> you<00:01:40.660> towards<00:01:41.140> the<00:01:41.259> machine<00:01:41.380> instead<00:01:41.950> of

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
pull you towards the machine instead of

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.040 
pull you towards the machine instead of
straight<00:01:42.640> down<00:01:42.850> in<00:01:43.090> the<00:01:43.210> in<00:01:43.330> the<00:01:43.509> other<00:01:43.600> person

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
straight down in the in the other person

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.050 
straight down in the in the other person
so<00:01:44.259> either<00:01:44.920> one<00:01:45.160> of<00:01:45.190> those<00:01:45.369> in<00:01:45.520> your<00:01:45.610> program

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
so either one of those in your program

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.960 
so either one of those in your program
or<00:01:46.450> both<00:01:46.660> on<00:01:47.020> different<00:01:47.350> days<00:01:47.610> and<00:01:48.610> it<00:01:48.790> hits

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
or both on different days and it hits

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.790 
or both on different days and it hits
the<00:01:49.090> triceps<00:01:49.509> totally<00:01:49.810> differently<00:01:50.170> again

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:50.800 
the triceps totally differently again

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.230 
the triceps totally differently again
that's<00:01:51.009> what<00:01:51.220> intervention<00:01:51.820> training<00:01:51.970> is

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
that's what intervention training is

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.910 
that's what intervention training is
it's<00:01:52.509> all<00:01:52.630> about<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.990> range<00:01:53.259> of<00:01:53.440> plane<00:01:53.710> of

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
it's all about the range of plane of
