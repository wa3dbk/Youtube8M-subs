comparing<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.890> terrorists<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.729> mean<00:02:05.939> visually

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
comparing and terrorists I mean visually

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.699

probably<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:11.190> main<00:02:11.400> catalyst<00:02:12.060> for<00:02:12.330> this

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
probably the main catalyst for this

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.400 
probably the main catalyst for this
backpedaling

backpedaling

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.980 
backpedaling
is<00:02:13.500> the<00:02:13.650> fact<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:13.980> they<00:02:14.580> dropped<00:02:14.880> kotaku<00:02:15.780> in
