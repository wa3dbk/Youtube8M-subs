by the appearance what you see is an
upper<00:00:09.090> molar<00:00:09.330> tooth<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.650> crown<00:00:11.040> here<00:00:11.519> is<00:00:11.670> the

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
upper molar tooth the crown here is the

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.030 
upper molar tooth the crown here is the
part<00:00:12.719> that<00:00:12.960> you<00:00:13.049> would<00:00:13.170> normally<00:00:13.559> see<00:00:13.769> in<00:00:13.799> the

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
part that you would normally see in the

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.609 
part that you would normally see in the
mouth<00:00:14.219> above<00:00:14.639> the<00:00:14.790> gum<00:00:15.049> as<00:00:16.049> an<00:00:16.320> old<00:00:16.470> metal

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
mouth above the gum as an old metal

mouth above the gum as an old metal
filling<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.580> then<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.480> roots<00:00:18.750> extend

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
filling in it and then the roots extend

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.160 
filling in it and then the roots extend
upwards<00:00:19.949> into<00:00:20.279> the<00:00:20.520> bone<00:00:20.789> and<00:00:20.820> gum<00:00:21.240> which<00:00:21.990> are

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
upwards into the bone and gum which are

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.019 
upwards into the bone and gum which are
the<00:00:22.230> foundations<00:00:22.920> of<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> tooth<00:00:23.430> so<00:00:23.789> that<00:00:23.939> you

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
the foundations of the tooth so that you

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:26.140 
the foundations of the tooth so that you
can<00:00:24.240> chew<00:00:24.510> on<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:24.840> back<00:00:25.080> molar

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:26.150 
can chew on a back molar

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.640 
can chew on a back molar
unfortunately<00:00:27.150> this<00:00:27.300> tooth<00:00:27.689> had<00:00:28.289> decayed

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
unfortunately this tooth had decayed

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.930 
unfortunately this tooth had decayed
under<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.369> old<00:00:29.760> filling<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.960> infection<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
under the old filling the infection and

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.400 
under the old filling the infection and
bacteria<00:00:32.940> spread<00:00:33.420> down<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.870> roots<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.290> the

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
bacteria spread down the roots of the

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.459 
bacteria spread down the roots of the
tooth<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:35.059> eventually<00:00:36.059> formed<00:00:36.540> abscesses<00:00:37.140> at

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
tooth and eventually formed abscesses at

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.680 
tooth and eventually formed abscesses at
the<00:00:37.559> end<00:00:37.710> of<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.980> root<00:00:38.190> here<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.390> see<00:00:39.540> the

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
the end of the root here you can see the

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.540 
the end of the root here you can see the
abscess<00:00:40.050> sac<00:00:40.320> still<00:00:40.770> intact

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
abscess sac still intact

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.090 
abscess sac still intact
we<00:00:42.239> had<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.480> use<00:00:42.510> all<00:00:42.840> our<00:00:42.899> skill<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.800> remove

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
we had to use all our skill to remove

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.630 
we had to use all our skill to remove
the<00:00:44.309> tooth<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.300> abscess<00:00:45.660> root<00:00:46.640> without

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
the tooth and the abscess root without

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.190 
the tooth and the abscess root without
breaking<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.450> because<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:48.930> you<00:00:49.020> look

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
breaking it because if you look

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.990 
breaking it because if you look
carefully<00:00:49.440> there<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.160> some<00:00:50.340> horizontal

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
carefully there are some horizontal

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.779 
carefully there are some horizontal
cracks<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.570> fractures<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.379> some<00:00:53.309> vertical

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
cracks and fractures and some vertical

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.139 
cracks and fractures and some vertical
ones<00:00:54.030> too<00:00:55.129> however<00:00:56.129> there's<00:00:56.520> three<00:00:56.760> rooted

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
ones too however there's three rooted

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.970 
ones too however there's three rooted
tooth<00:00:57.420> we<00:00:57.660> managed<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:57.960> get<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.350> Hall<00:00:58.680> and

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
tooth we managed to get out Hall and

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.029 
tooth we managed to get out Hall and
intact<00:00:59.730> including<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.570> abscess<00:01:00.960> sack<00:01:01.230> so

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
intact including the abscess sack so

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.149 
intact including the abscess sack so
that<00:01:02.219> healing<00:01:02.640> can<00:01:03.149> proceed<00:01:03.750> without

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
that healing can proceed without

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.480 
that healing can proceed without
complications<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.720> without<00:01:06.720> infection

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
complications and without infection

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.640 
complications and without infection
however<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:09.390> can<00:01:09.630> sometimes<00:01:09.840> save<00:01:10.380> teeth

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
however you can sometimes save teeth

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.740 
however you can sometimes save teeth
with<00:01:10.890> root<00:01:11.100> canal<00:01:11.430> treatment<00:01:11.460> but<00:01:12.450> in<00:01:12.600> this

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
with root canal treatment but in this

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.539 
with root canal treatment but in this
case<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.290> roots<00:01:13.500> were<00:01:13.710> cracked<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.369> I'm

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
case the roots were cracked and I'm

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.550 
case the roots were cracked and I'm
afraid<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:15.030> tooth<00:01:15.270> was<00:01:15.930> doomed<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.439> have

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
afraid the tooth was doomed to have

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.010 
afraid the tooth was doomed to have
further<00:01:16.890> complications<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:18.450> it<00:01:18.600> required

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
further complications so it required

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.710 
further complications so it required
removal<00:01:19.650> indeed<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:21.000> see<00:01:21.210> at<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.420> side

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
removal indeed you can see at the side

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.020 
removal indeed you can see at the side
here<00:01:22.110> there's<00:01:22.740> a<00:01:22.860> lateral<00:01:23.250> periodontal

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
here there's a lateral periodontal

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.170 
here there's a lateral periodontal
abscess<00:01:25.130> associated<00:01:26.130> with<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> edge<00:01:26.759> of<00:01:27.000> one

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
abscess associated with the edge of one

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.870 
abscess associated with the edge of one
of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.450> cracks<00:01:27.750> across<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.380> root<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.759> I'm

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
of the cracks across the root so I'm

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.850 
of the cracks across the root so I'm
afraid<00:01:30.090> this<00:01:30.360> tooth<00:01:30.630> never<00:01:31.079> really<00:01:31.439> stood<00:01:31.650> a

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
afraid this tooth never really stood a

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.789 
afraid this tooth never really stood a
chance<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.460> surviving<00:01:32.970> long<00:01:33.180> term<00:01:33.619> the<00:01:34.619> gap

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
chance of surviving long term the gap

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.719 
chance of surviving long term the gap
that<00:01:35.009> is<00:01:35.070> left

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that is left

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.359 
that is left
well<00:01:36.329> one<00:01:36.689> can<00:01:36.900> leave<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.320> gap<00:01:37.500> if<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.189> does

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
well one can leave the gap if it does

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.580 
well one can leave the gap if it does
not<00:01:38.520> show<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.030> smile<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.780> all<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.500> the
