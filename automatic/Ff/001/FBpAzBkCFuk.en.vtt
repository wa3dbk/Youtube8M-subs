 from the beginning that they are forming and 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.909
 hide under the earth 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.500
 turtles are the ideal pet for 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:07.940
 grandparents because adolescence we're going 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.240

 there are people who have ground hedgehogs 

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:18.759

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.490

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.900
 I said to our pets 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.320

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:36.320

 now when dogs bark people 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.910

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.430

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.050
 people who live next to the warriors 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:57.960

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.030
 model to tremble 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.350

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.319
 the house of a friend and the dog arrives and 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.420
 start having sex with your leg 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:23.890

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:23.890
 he wants that dog and one starts like that 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.720

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:36.970
 I had never done it, nobody feels 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.970
 super flattered 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.170
 and then another person arrives the dog goes 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.180

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.180

 one has a bird and encloses it and the 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:10.150

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.459

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.800
 I do not know what I'm going to make friends with 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.140
 pet that does not know how to even learn 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.310

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:43.360
 the kittens gentlemen to the kittens do not 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.550

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.430
 Super psycho as well as a kitten catches her

 what happened to the poor snob and who 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.420
 it was without fault and is selling insurance 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.610
 imagine one 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.020
 that sure is going to leave you 'charlie 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.300
 brown 'bully 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:10.729
 charge you 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.529
 because companies always put as a 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:18.390
 pet animal 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:21.390
 so it's those three monkeys 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.490
 they are like bacteria 

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.890
 there are people who come to the house of 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.260
 animals because it hurts you to pick them up and 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.360
 I looked who had the leg and it's not 

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.060
 that is also those same people enter 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.900
 I knew leaving the town there is 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.560
 I was sorry to finish with them 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.840
 one more night in Africa one can have 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.150
 the pet you want can have a 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:45.710
 lion if you want the only problem is that 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.550
 you can not treat them like pets like that 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:48.550
 like taking matrices 

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.680
