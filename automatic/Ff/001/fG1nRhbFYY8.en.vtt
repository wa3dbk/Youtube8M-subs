Ashley<00:03:31.420> inducted<00:03:31.780> and<00:03:31.870> they<00:03:32.049> mentioned

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:32.829 
Ashley inducted and they mentioned

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:34.670 
Ashley inducted and they mentioned
nothing<00:03:33.220> really<00:03:33.459> about<00:03:33.609> the<00:03:33.880> NWO<00:03:34.329> and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
nothing really about the NWO and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.550 
nothing really about the NWO and
hauling<00:03:35.219> stuff<00:03:35.540> and<00:03:36.540> I'm<00:03:36.810> surprised<00:03:37.409> they

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
hauling stuff and I'm surprised they

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.869 
hauling stuff and I'm surprised they
didn't<00:03:37.799> really<00:03:38.010> mention<00:03:38.219> anything<00:03:38.700> about

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
didn't really mention anything about

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.789 
didn't really mention anything about
that<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:41.810> so<00:03:42.810> I<00:03:43.109> have<00:03:43.290> a<00:03:43.349> feeling<00:03:43.680> they're

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
that and so I have a feeling they're

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.459 
that and so I have a feeling they're
gonna<00:03:43.920> induct<00:03:44.250> the<00:03:44.340> NWO<00:03:44.909> sometime<00:03:45.540> in<00:03:45.840> the

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:46.469 
gonna induct the NWO sometime in the

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:55.300 
gonna induct the NWO sometime in the
heat<00:03:46.859> in<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.280> near<00:03:47.519> future<00:03:47.790> or<00:03:48.060> whatever<00:03:48.209> and

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:55.310 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.509 

so<00:03:56.310> after<00:03:56.849> that<00:03:57.150> was<00:03:58.010> Carlos<00:03:59.010> Cologne<00:03:59.340> they

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519
