pair<00:03:23.739> of<00:03:23.890> false<00:03:24.070> lashes<00:03:24.340> but<00:03:24.820> I<00:03:24.880> thought<00:03:25.209> that

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
pair of false lashes but I thought that

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.210

might not look very natural outside
under<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.670> strong<00:03:28.060> daylight<00:03:28.510> so<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:29.079> decided

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
under the strong daylight so I decided

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.890 
under the strong daylight so I decided
to<00:03:29.650> skip<00:03:29.859> it<00:03:30.100> and<00:03:30.250> go<00:03:30.340> with<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.760> very<00:03:31.120> volumizing

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
to skip it and go with a very volumizing

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:39.040 
to skip it and go with a very volumizing
