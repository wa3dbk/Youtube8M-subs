00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.509
 hello friends today 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.640
 freeze excess for the winter out 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.630
 beautiful recipe for which I am 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.840
 doing now see everything means my 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.840
 cherry 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:31.590
 cleaned from the roots, and pile up and basins 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.920
 and then you need a neat wagon 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.260
 pull out the bone already 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.700
 who is ready for anything 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.200
 take out who can eat like 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.160
 special adaptations can 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.950
 a pin 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:50.270
 in general, now we will do it here 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.739
 this is already pitted cherries 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.140
 Of course it's a long time to clean it 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.420
 bones and the rest will not take much 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.420
 time we proceed to the process 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.100
 so we need a meat grinder maybe 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.430
 who does not have a meat grinder 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.030
 you can use and blender we need 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.780
 part of the cherry grind now we are to this 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.780
 let's get started 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:45.380
 got just such a flesh cherry sauce 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.380
 the pulp of the evening here fall asleep sugar 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:02:00.000
 pour sugar and stir the principle 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:02:03.900
 legs can do it all now take 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.070
 hammer plastic pour there 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.899
 pitted cherries not quite full 

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:13.950
 because over we will fill here 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:18.780
 This mixture is superfluous and see what 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.530
 it will turn out and this is how the top one turned out 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.910
 cherry juice sugar on 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.650
 close the lid send the freezer 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.830
 the exact same cherry 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.380
 you can make but pour me a cherry 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.890
 sugar syrup and make raspberries 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:37.230
 put sugar in there and so 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.140
 raspberry sugar syrup pour here 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.780
 such a cherry and freeze it will be 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.200
 not at all so try 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.850
 experiment do and so and so 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.720
 what we have more to taste 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.720
 choose that
