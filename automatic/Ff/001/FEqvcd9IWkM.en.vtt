00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.970
 champions 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.280
 without asking anything 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.050

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:36.790
 say that lately this game always 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:36.790
 it was love is what matters 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:45.690
 and the one that the xbox command already has 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.690
 memorized but please 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:58.280
 today we go 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.280
 like us 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.290
 in football I thought I was hitting the end 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.619
 first because I say look at you that gives you 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.619
 failure 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.129
 in the defense area 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:22.659
 there is still a fabric of notes and things like that 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.900
 what are you doing uncle is that I shit on 

00:02:22.659 --> 00:02:28.469
 all why do you do that to God and this one 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.469
 touch now 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.630
 and playing in the middle and join with 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.310
 one and because it gives the fucking mother 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.310
 and now yes 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.730
 so I did not say it's not going 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.730
 nothing 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:53.260
 x 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.620
 I'm not very good at the normal florida 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.620
 your faith 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.590
 it's not worth 20 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:05.129
 fuck 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.730
 to all of thinking and without good end 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.730
 first time 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.970
 in the second 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.860
 this is what I have put the change in 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.860
 the second game we have launched 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.300
 how is incredible 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.940
 the euro pass that badly the 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.650
 player 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:53.260
 the as they do not have lateral as it is called 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:58.439
 from brawn 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:04:02.250
 it will not be 10 medium silver that I had 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:05.250
 I put in all this new tired 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.250
 qualities 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.370
 I'm also passing it on 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.020
 light 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.850
 the typical goal of 90 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:41.660
 how 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:45.550
 then today 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.550
 what control of cock god 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:53.940
 so 

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.940
 it's a very match 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.870
 all right 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.380
 he has played very well how are the 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:06.380
 Arrivals 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:12.790
 now the statistics 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.100
 it helps a lot more than me 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.670
 the goal was to not mark the 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.380
 double goals and it's there until the end 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:31.700
 so that 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.190
 but I have a little bit more 

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:37.130
 Luck the negative truth if you want 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.750
 say it before and deciding the birds that 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:41.420
 it's easy for the return to be on my channel 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.560
 will give to see if with a bit of luck you 

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:45.440
 he came to come back he will be difficult 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.690
 but good you have to try and they 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.020
 Yes hopefully if we get stable 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.040
 at least put humor rightly 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.390
 As you said, I will now go through your 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.540
 channel that is here the turn and is not 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.130
 for nothing decided 

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:58.390
