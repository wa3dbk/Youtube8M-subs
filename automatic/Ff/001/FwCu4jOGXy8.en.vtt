00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:12.699
 number lower number 

00:00:12.699 --> 00:00:16.099
 when those that we yesterday the number of victories of a number 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:19.720
 we will be able to use this practical method 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:21.109
 first beeps 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.060
 we did not say how much money was spent 8 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.060
 we have to find 

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:30.839
 the right dividers 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.580
 the contest is answered what are they sorel however the question about 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.030
 how much 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.240
 let's answer 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.010
 also does worship 3 4 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.410
 four deaths 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.410
 but nevertheless 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.070
 study today in class 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.070
 a much shorter method 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.210
 8 had a lot to break down those prime factors 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.330
 we are only halfway 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.270
 half 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.260
 other half 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.910
 then let's write 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.350
 the prime factors 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.340
 of the abbreviated form 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.340
 2t taken to the kun because we have three of these 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.560
 aek exponent that we see 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.210
 we are going to add a unit 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.340
 note 4 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.360
 polokwane 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.340
 quickly we can yesterday we number eight and have four the start 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.990
 do not confuse the question how many directors or 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.610
 what are the different 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.550
 pinedo practical for mind allows me to answer the question how many are 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.260
 they are four 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.620
 while with this process I will be able to find walid are a site 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.840
 let's give one more example 

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.380
 if they asked us 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.380
 how many of you have 24 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.900
 let's do it in both ways 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.270
 odyssey 24 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.209
 there is 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.729
 4 

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:14.949
 yes 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:15.769
 12 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.769
 and the same 24 

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:25.509
 so those are the divisors of 24 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:29.919
 we count four divisions are several worlds 2 3 4 5 

00:02:29.919 --> 00:02:31.540
 6 citi 8 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:33.209
 8 15 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.230
 and what a way 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.129
 Seville 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:37.139
 practical process 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.199
 we decompose 24 into its prime factors 

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:43.199
 when decomposing 24 scares we would have 

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.119
 12 

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:49.549
 6 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.999
 Finally 

00:02:50.999 --> 00:02:52.619
 said 1 

00:02:52.619 --> 00:02:54.419
 and writing this 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.439
 in an abbreviated manner 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:02:59.439
 as an extreme protector would be the next 

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:03.789
 those present from 2 why the cube 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:06.310
 peris with our readers 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.310
 we will be interested in unity 

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.669
 ar exponent 2007 important step of adding a unit 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.459
 to this expo of interest such we are children would be two 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.589
 and I went to multiply 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.499
 and this the spot 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:27.769
 so let's practice there I adopted 24 108 and cheers the same opinion 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.999
 upper part 

00:03:28.999 --> 00:03:30.669
 clearly what 

00:03:30.669 --> 00:03:32.109
 in the difference 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.519
 between the first and second ixtepec method and in addition to how many 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.759
 know what they are 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:41.770
 but if only the question were rooms we could publish the others 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.770
 the method for 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.279
 we play a temple 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:51.969
 additional 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:55.089
 if you ask me how many divisors is 60 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:59.449
 suddenly they are how many 

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:02.330
 if I need to know how many divisors you have 60 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:04.559
 we will proceed to do the following way 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.029
 practical method 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:07.729
 60 

00:04:07.729 --> 00:04:10.729
 decomposition in its factors pri 

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:15.539
 menezes for us 30 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.359
 we have to go bloat 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.279
 activity 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.800
 but he does not tell us that we can establish if that day 5 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.610
 and 5a 1 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.289
 despise simplifies the product prime factors series the following 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:35.389
 way 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:36.590
 square 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:37.830
 for three 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.199
 to unity because regrets and companies 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:43.199
 by 5 also to the unit because only they 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.139
 then the process continues 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.580
 by suddenly suddenly more important and 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.060
 alex west 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.979
 and canada 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:53.180
 prime factor 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:55.059
 there are they say give me a unit 

00:04:55.059 --> 00:05:00.400
 to two of them we go or not I have three this unit 21 I only have two 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.400
 in the same way this important body 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.939
 we proceed with multiplication 

00:05:06.939 --> 00:05:11.199
 i could get 3 for 2 66 for two 2 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.389
 in this way 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:16.729
 my answer to the question how many prime directors have 60 from the 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.729
 next answer 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.120
 two exercises 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.849
 you have to practice for the evaluation 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.819
 are the reinforcement exercises we want to develop with the 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:36.189
 last week 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:40.409
 If you have any questions about the same exercises, do not hesitate to register the 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:41.460
 members for 

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.199
 to be able to make a video to answer them how each team develops 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:46.520
 sport
