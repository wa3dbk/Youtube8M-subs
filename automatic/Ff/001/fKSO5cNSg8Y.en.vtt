00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.059
 hey gets a new video 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.359
 with me and now so have the pure rock 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:22.320
 from be quiet here on my review 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.050
 table in the typical be quiet look 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.910
 black kept the packaging one year 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.080
 cpu fan easy to recognize 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:34.500
 it runs with a tdp of 130 to 150 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.899
 Wad a really great cooling performance 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.079
 for really small price now loads 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.059
 the packaging standard but yes it comes 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.239
 of course, the inner values of 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.300
 The cooler is natural for everyone 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.120
 common amd socket and for internal 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:57.120
 intended purposes 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.370
 1011 1950 so in the year of 2011 also quite clear that 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.710
 grab her loose 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.820
 That should not be a problem so it is 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.939
 no problem with me 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.080
 Tested as said before that is for the 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:10.710
 entry class so in the price range 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.130
 thought costs last important lying 120 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.869
 euro I've seen cheapest what it 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.820
 So really not really expensive 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.710
 the cooling power is also like that was me 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.090
 link below the nice test 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.490
 contribution there you could the whole 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.580
 see temperature comparisons and yes im 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.979
 the scope of course, the heat sink 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.909
 made of aluminum with copper heatpipes the 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.220
 120 millimeter fan from be quiet 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.409
 he is very quiet you really hear him 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.840
 hardly at the annual speeds of the 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.880
 usual paperwork is doing as well 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.920
 said at fans always important to read 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.829
 you go through how to install it 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.530
 The accessory pack has changed too 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:52.380
 standard things to attach the hanger 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.820
 the fan is a little bit on every system 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.250
 differently here it is such a hanger 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.399
 then simply clamp around the fans 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.100
 around the guide rails all the way up 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.829
 to install the socket in the city 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.930
 metal backplate i find metal 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.849
 always looks better than plastic 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.259
 Simply more stable you do not need 

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:12.510
 fear to screw 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.360
 and of course the rest 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.260
 screw those 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.940
 you need so for the respective socket 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.860
 refrigerated truck is not there that is already 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.730
 applied and you you see as yet 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.900
 sometimes in detail in the close-up 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.300
 really the processing at away far 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.240
 is as always high quality we have on 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:34.270
 each side four heatpipes with direct 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.110
 a copper surface that we will now 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.320
 also see here 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.330
 there is the thermally conductive paste on it thus 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.650
 I will really keep the heat very much 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:47.350
 well done by the processor what 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.910
 Of course, that's really important and yes 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.310
 you see her with the fan of 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.340
 screwed on is the heatsink and itself 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.030
 is not really big that's nice 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.790
 small 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.880
 I like that because we have one yes 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:08.190
 Often times problems with the frame 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:10.450
 measures 86 87 5 to 121 to 155 millimeters 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.060
 Of course it is linked again below 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.920
 yes you can on the manufacturer side 

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.890
 look and see you all over again 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.530
 take a closer look at the data 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.630
 The volume is right, as I said 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.880
 quietly I have no test now unfortunately 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.590
 Recording there but we can believe it 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.200
 that is good for the cool 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.200
 and yes it was looking said of me
