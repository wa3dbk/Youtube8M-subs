we can do I don't really want to take
this<00:01:03.629> one<00:01:03.840> on<00:01:04.610> because<00:01:05.610> I<00:01:05.640> think<00:01:05.760> this<00:01:06.180> might

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
this one on because I think this might

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.240 
this one on because I think this might
be<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.869> little<00:01:07.080> difficult<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:07.799> i'll<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.130> back

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
be a little difficult so i'll be back

be a little difficult so i'll be back
with<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.520> guys<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.360> second<00:01:09.720> when<00:01:10.560> we

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
with you guys in just a second when we

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.070 
with you guys in just a second when we
find<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.220> base<00:01:11.760> that<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.030> actually<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.540> we<00:01:12.750> can

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
find a base that I actually think we can

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.380 
find a base that I actually think we can
take<00:01:13.650> over<00:01:13.830> with<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.430> army<00:01:15.060> calm<00:01:15.240> because

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
take over with this army calm because

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.030 
take over with this army calm because
this<00:01:15.600> is<00:01:15.750> going<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.020> be<00:01:16.140> hard<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.740> lot

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
this is going to be hard this is a lot

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.820 
this is going to be hard this is a lot
of<00:01:17.220> melee<00:01:17.549> troops<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.470> the<00:01:19.470> fact<00:01:19.740> that

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
of melee troops and the fact that

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.260 
of melee troops and the fact that
timeless<00:01:20.189> islands<00:01:20.490> have<00:01:20.610> three<00:01:20.880> mortars

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
timeless islands have three mortars

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.230 
timeless islands have three mortars
means<00:01:21.659> that<00:01:22.170> I<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:23.159> really<00:01:23.640> have<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:23.850> play<00:01:24.090> this

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
means that I I really have to play this

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.030 
means that I I really have to play this
perfectly<00:01:24.689> so<00:01:24.960> I'll<00:01:25.170> be<00:01:25.259> back<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.619> second<00:01:25.950> I

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
perfectly so I'll be back in a second I

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.340 
perfectly so I'll be back in a second I
see<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.369> guys<00:01:26.490> all<00:01:26.790> right<00:01:27.420> guys<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.110> think

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
see you guys all right guys so I think

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.819 
see you guys all right guys so I think
this<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.159> going<00:01:29.280> to<00:01:29.340> be<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.579> base<00:01:29.759> um<00:01:30.680> he<00:01:31.680> does

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
this is going to be the base um he does

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.310 
this is going to be the base um he does
have<00:01:32.040> like<00:01:32.970> all<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.329> his<00:01:33.360> defenses<00:01:33.960> up<00:01:34.140> so

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
have like all of his defenses up so

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.890 
have like all of his defenses up so
nothing<00:01:34.470> is<00:01:34.680> under<00:01:34.950> construction<00:01:35.780> so<00:01:36.780> this

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
nothing is under construction so this

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.210 
nothing is under construction so this
could<00:01:37.079> be<00:01:37.229> a<00:01:37.259> little<00:01:37.500> bit<00:01:37.650> challenging<00:01:38.070> it's

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
could be a little bit challenging it's

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.219 
could be a little bit challenging it's
definitely<00:01:38.579> going<00:01:38.670> to<00:01:38.729> be<00:01:38.790> challenging<00:01:39.299> this

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
definitely going to be challenging this

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.370 
definitely going to be challenging this
is<00:01:40.820> not<00:01:41.820> as<00:01:41.970> easy<00:01:42.090> as<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.540> looks<00:01:43.140> especially

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
is not as easy as it looks especially

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.460 
is not as easy as it looks especially
with<00:01:43.740> all<00:01:43.890> of<00:01:44.130> these<00:01:44.840> mortars<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.140> we're<00:01:46.380> going

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
doing this is with j-rod after we're

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.360 
doing this is with j-rod after we're
done<00:04:30.729> doing<00:04:30.970> it<00:04:31.120> with<00:04:31.240> j-rod<00:04:31.630> we're<00:04:31.870> gonna<00:04:32.370> try

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
done doing it with j-rod we're gonna try

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.189 
done doing it with j-rod we're gonna try
and<00:04:33.550> find<00:04:33.789> some<00:04:34.060> other<00:04:34.120> youtubers<00:04:34.750> to<00:04:34.900> do<00:04:35.020> it

and find some other youtubers to do it
with<00:04:36.100> us<00:04:36.280> so<00:04:36.520> I<00:04:36.550> think<00:04:36.639> that'll<00:04:37.000> be<00:04:37.030> really

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
with us so I think that'll be really

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.450 
with us so I think that'll be really
cool<00:04:37.479> but<00:04:37.889> we<00:04:38.889> still<00:04:39.340> have<00:04:39.639> our<00:04:40.590> s<00:04:41.590> +<00:04:41.860> E<00:04:41.889> to<00:04:42.100> get

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
cool but we still have our s + E to get

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.000 
cool but we still have our s + E to get
so<00:04:42.820> hopefully<00:04:43.419> hopefully<00:04:44.320> I<00:04:44.530> can<00:04:44.650> make<00:04:44.770> that

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
so hopefully hopefully I can make that

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.969 
so hopefully hopefully I can make that
happen<00:04:45.070> where<00:04:45.820> um<00:04:46.110> where<00:04:47.110> we<00:04:47.440> win<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.800> next

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979
