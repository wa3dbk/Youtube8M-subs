going to leave them alone the next thing

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.500 
going to leave them alone the next thing
we're<00:05:24.280> going<00:05:24.370> to<00:05:24.430> do<00:05:24.639> this<00:05:24.820> can<00:05:25.090> be<00:05:25.210> a<00:05:25.270> little

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
we're going to do this can be a little

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.200 
we're going to do this can be a little
bit<00:05:25.720> tricky<00:05:26.340> what<00:05:27.340> we're<00:05:27.490> going<00:05:27.610> to<00:05:27.699> do<00:05:27.910> is

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:28.210 
bit tricky what we're going to do is

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.330 
bit tricky what we're going to do is
we're<00:05:29.199> going<00:05:29.500> to<00:05:31.320> you<00:05:32.320> could<00:05:32.590> take<00:05:32.860> a<00:05:32.889> cleaver

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
we're going to you could take a cleaver

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.370 
we're going to you could take a cleaver
and<00:05:33.610> chop<00:05:34.030> right<00:05:34.330> down<00:05:34.539> the<00:05:34.720> middle<00:05:34.750> but<00:05:35.080> one

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:35.380 
and chop right down the middle but one

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.830 
and chop right down the middle but one
usually<00:05:36.010> one<00:05:36.250> piece<00:05:36.550> of<00:05:36.760> the<00:05:36.820> breast<00:05:37.120> is<00:05:37.360> going

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:37.840 
usually one piece of the breast is going

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.430 
usually one piece of the breast is going
to<00:05:37.960> have<00:05:38.139> part<00:05:38.949> of<00:05:39.130> this<00:05:39.750> breastplate<00:05:40.750> bone

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
to have part of this breastplate bone

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:43.860 
to have part of this breastplate bone
that<00:05:41.830> center<00:05:42.280> bone<00:05:42.490> on<00:05:42.849> it<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.360> the<00:05:43.479> other<00:05:43.510> one

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
that center bone on it and the other one

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.300 
that center bone on it and the other one
is<00:05:43.900> it<00:05:44.229> so<00:05:44.409> when<00:05:44.560> you<00:05:44.650> cook<00:05:44.860> it<00:05:44.889> it's<00:05:45.130> going<00:05:45.250> to

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
is it so when you cook it it's going to

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.310 
is it so when you cook it it's going to
be<00:05:45.460> uneven<00:05:45.970> what<00:05:46.479> we're<00:05:46.659> going<00:05:46.780> to<00:05:46.870> do<00:05:47.080> is

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:47.320 
be uneven what we're going to do is

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.399 
be uneven what we're going to do is
we're<00:05:47.620> going<00:05:47.740> to<00:05:47.800> take<00:05:47.860> this<00:05:48.720> plate<00:05:49.720> bone<00:05:50.080> out

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
we're going to take this plate bone out

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:53.790 
we're going to take this plate bone out
and<00:05:50.889> the<00:05:51.550> way<00:05:51.669> we<00:05:51.820> do<00:05:52.000> that<00:05:52.409> we<00:05:53.409> turn<00:05:53.620> the

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:53.800 
and the way we do that we turn the

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.520 
and the way we do that we turn the
breast<00:05:54.070> around<00:05:54.460> so<00:05:54.760> that<00:05:54.789> the<00:05:55.449> point<00:05:56.289> is

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:56.530 
breast around so that the point is

00:05:56.530 --> 00:05:59.010 
breast around so that the point is
facing<00:05:57.280> away<00:05:57.370> and<00:05:57.820> we<00:05:58.150> put<00:05:58.360> a<00:05:58.389> little<00:05:58.570> slit

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
facing away and we put a little slit

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.219 
facing away and we put a little slit
right<00:05:59.860> down<00:06:00.190> through<00:06:00.520> this<00:06:00.789> bone<00:06:01.090> now<00:06:02.050> what<00:06:02.200> I

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:02.229 
right down through this bone now what I

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.180 
right down through this bone now what I
do<00:06:02.349> is<00:06:02.770> I<00:06:03.099> it<00:06:03.849> should<00:06:04.510> break<00:06:05.320> somewhere<00:06:05.979> right

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
do is I it should break somewhere right

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.990 
do is I it should break somewhere right
here<00:06:06.550> so<00:06:06.729> I

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:07.000 
here so I

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.850 
here so I
to<00:06:07.090> slit<00:06:07.360> there<00:06:07.600> and<00:06:07.780> somewhere<00:06:08.230> right<00:06:08.500> there

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
to slit there and somewhere right there

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:14.970 
to slit there and somewhere right there
and<00:06:09.100> then<00:06:09.850> just<00:06:10.150> lightly<00:06:12.510> score<00:06:13.510> this<00:06:13.780> with<00:06:14.470> my

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
and then just lightly score this with my

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:18.120 
and then just lightly score this with my
knife<00:06:15.250> and<00:06:15.550> the<00:06:16.030> idea<00:06:16.510> is<00:06:16.540> when<00:06:17.470> I<00:06:17.500> break<00:06:17.890> it

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:18.130 
knife and the idea is when I break it

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.110 
knife and the idea is when I break it
like<00:06:19.030> that<00:06:19.270> it<00:06:19.960> actually<00:06:20.230> pulls<00:06:20.830> this<00:06:21.280> thin

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 
like that it actually pulls this thin

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.450 
like that it actually pulls this thin
layer<00:06:22.510> away<00:06:23.050> from<00:06:23.290> the<00:06:23.410> bone<00:06:23.560> if<00:06:23.740> you<00:06:23.890> run<00:06:24.220> your

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:24.460 
layer away from the bone if you run your

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:27.090 
layer away from the bone if you run your
knife<00:06:24.610> down<00:06:24.910> on<00:06:25.090> it<00:06:25.210> very<00:06:26.020> deeply<00:06:26.440> you'll

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
knife down on it very deeply you'll

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.590 
knife down on it very deeply you'll
actually<00:06:27.280> score<00:06:27.820> the<00:06:27.970> bone<00:06:28.150> and<00:06:28.330> then<00:06:28.450> you'll

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:28.600 
actually score the bone and then you'll

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.320 
actually score the bone and then you'll
split<00:06:28.810> above<00:06:29.230> so<00:06:29.920> we<00:06:30.040> take<00:06:30.250> our<00:06:30.400> thumbnail<00:06:30.820> we

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
split above so we take our thumbnail we

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:36.560 
split above so we take our thumbnail we
slide<00:06:31.660> it<00:06:31.930> underneath<00:06:32.260> this<00:06:32.700> bone<00:06:33.700> here<00:06:34.000> and

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
slide it underneath this bone here and

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:41.670 
slide it underneath this bone here and
we're<00:06:37.570> pulling<00:06:38.020> this<00:06:38.200> fine<00:06:39.810> skin<00:06:40.810> away<00:06:41.200> we're

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 
we're pulling this fine skin away we're

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:46.980 
we're pulling this fine skin away we're
going<00:06:41.800> to<00:06:41.860> repeat<00:06:42.160> it<00:06:42.310> over<00:06:42.430> here<00:06:45.660> and<00:06:46.660> again

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
going to repeat it over here and again

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.170 
going to repeat it over here and again
we<00:06:47.200> run<00:06:47.380> our<00:06:47.530> finger<00:06:47.860> down<00:06:47.980> now<00:06:48.640> what<00:06:49.000> we're

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
we run our finger down now what we're

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.870 
we run our finger down now what we're
going<00:06:49.300> to<00:06:49.390> do<00:06:49.600> is<00:06:49.870> we<00:06:50.140> actually<00:06:50.610> pull<00:06:51.610> this

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
going to do is we actually pull this

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.760 
going to do is we actually pull this
bone<00:06:52.270> out<00:06:53.280> so<00:06:54.280> we<00:06:54.370> get<00:06:54.580> hold<00:06:54.790> of<00:06:54.940> it<00:06:55.530> we<00:06:56.530> pull

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:56.770 
bone out so we get hold of it we pull

00:06:56.770 --> 00:06:59.880 
bone out so we get hold of it we pull
that<00:06:56.980> bone<00:06:57.220> all<00:06:58.150> the<00:06:58.360> way<00:06:58.480> out<00:06:58.680> what<00:06:59.680> that's

00:06:59.880 --> 00:06:59.890 
that bone all the way out what that's

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:03.540 
that bone all the way out what that's
done<00:07:00.220> is<00:07:00.430> now<00:07:01.300> we<00:07:01.360> have<00:07:01.919> where<00:07:02.919> we<00:07:03.100> can<00:07:03.280> cut<00:07:03.460> it

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:03.550 
done is now we have where we can cut it

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:05.250 
done is now we have where we can cut it
right<00:07:03.669> down<00:07:03.730> the<00:07:03.940> center<00:07:04.210> there's<00:07:04.660> still<00:07:05.020> a

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
right down the center there's still a

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:08.130 
right down the center there's still a
wishbone<00:07:05.500> in<00:07:06.010> here<00:07:06.370> right<00:07:07.330> down<00:07:07.660> in<00:07:07.990> the

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:08.140 
wishbone in here right down in the

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.800 
wishbone in here right down in the
center<00:07:08.500> but<00:07:09.060> what<00:07:10.060> we're<00:07:10.210> going<00:07:10.360> to<00:07:10.450> do<00:07:10.600> next

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810 
center but what we're going to do next

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:13.409 
center but what we're going to do next
we<00:07:11.229> make<00:07:11.440> sure<00:07:11.470> that<00:07:11.650> the<00:07:11.860> skin<00:07:12.310> is<00:07:12.520> down<00:07:13.240> the

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:13.419 
we make sure that the skin is down the

00:07:13.419 --> 00:07:15.150 
we make sure that the skin is down the
center<00:07:13.660> because<00:07:13.840> we<00:07:14.110> want<00:07:14.290> to<00:07:14.350> save<00:07:14.830> as<00:07:15.010> much

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:15.160 
center because we want to save as much

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.070 
center because we want to save as much
skin<00:07:15.400> as<00:07:15.520> we<00:07:15.760> can<00:07:15.970> that's<00:07:16.540> where<00:07:16.750> the<00:07:16.840> flavor

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:17.080 
skin as we can that's where the flavor

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.280 
skin as we can that's where the flavor
comes<00:07:17.229> from<00:07:18.419> we're<00:07:19.419> going<00:07:19.540> to<00:07:19.600> flip<00:07:19.810> this<00:07:19.870> over

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:20.290 
comes from we're going to flip this over

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.909 
comes from we're going to flip this over
and<00:07:20.620> I'm<00:07:21.220> just<00:07:21.550> going<00:07:21.760> to<00:07:22.000> with<00:07:22.720> my<00:07:22.960> night<00:07:23.169> cup

00:07:23.909 --> 00:07:23.919 
and I'm just going to with my night cup

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:26.610 
and I'm just going to with my night cup
right<00:07:24.310> down<00:07:24.640> through<00:07:24.970> ok<00:07:25.690> so<00:07:26.140> I<00:07:26.169> started

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:26.620 
right down through ok so I started

00:07:26.620 --> 00:07:30.170 
right down through ok so I started
cutting<00:07:26.950> that<00:07:27.100> I<00:07:27.400> flip<00:07:28.330> it<00:07:28.450> over<00:07:28.630> and<00:07:28.930> again<00:07:29.890> I

00:07:30.170 --> 00:07:30.180 
cutting that I flip it over and again I

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:36.230 
cutting that I flip it over and again I
can<00:07:31.180> cut<00:07:31.450> right<00:07:32.190> down<00:07:33.190> the<00:07:33.610> center<00:07:34.470> like<00:07:35.470> that

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 
can cut right down the center like that

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.260 
can cut right down the center like that
and<00:07:37.770> then<00:07:38.770> like<00:07:38.979> that<00:07:39.250> now<00:07:39.460> all<00:07:39.760> that's<00:07:39.970> really

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:40.270 
and then like that now all that's really

00:07:40.270 --> 00:07:43.770 
and then like that now all that's really
holding<00:07:40.870> this<00:07:41.080> is<00:07:41.790> the<00:07:42.790> bone<00:07:43.000> because<00:07:43.450> I<00:07:43.570> cut

00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:43.780 
holding this is the bone because I cut

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:46.290 
holding this is the bone because I cut
over<00:07:44.020> here<00:07:44.350> and<00:07:45.130> I<00:07:45.220> cut<00:07:45.430> on<00:07:45.550> the<00:07:45.669> other<00:07:45.820> side<00:07:46.090> so

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:46.300 
over here and I cut on the other side so

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:48.030 
over here and I cut on the other side so
what<00:07:46.750> all<00:07:46.930> I<00:07:46.960> have<00:07:47.229> to<00:07:47.350> do<00:07:47.470> now<00:07:47.500> is<00:07:47.680> actually

00:07:48.030 --> 00:07:48.040 
what all I have to do now is actually

00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.030 
what all I have to do now is actually
just<00:07:48.460> turn<00:07:48.729> it<00:07:49.169> and<00:07:50.169> what<00:07:50.380> i've<00:07:50.500> done<00:07:50.710> is<00:07:50.770> i

00:07:51.030 --> 00:07:51.040 
just turn it and what i've done is i

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.310 
just turn it and what i've done is i
have<00:07:51.070> two<00:07:51.490> identical<00:07:51.820> pieces<00:07:52.330> of<00:07:52.930> breast

00:07:53.310 --> 00:07:53.320 
have two identical pieces of breast

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.460 
have two identical pieces of breast
without<00:07:53.950> a<00:07:54.250> piece<00:07:54.580> of<00:07:54.610> bone<00:07:55.479> running<00:07:56.200> on<00:07:56.320> one

00:07:56.460 --> 00:07:56.470 
without a piece of bone running on one

00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:58.650 
without a piece of bone running on one
side<00:07:56.770> that's<00:07:57.669> pretty<00:07:57.850> much<00:07:57.970> it<00:07:58.120> we've

00:07:58.650 --> 00:07:58.660 
side that's pretty much it we've

00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:02.219 
side that's pretty much it we've
completed<00:07:59.229> a<00:08:00.130> cut-up<00:08:00.640> chicken<00:08:00.760> and<00:08:01.360> we're

00:08:02.219 --> 00:08:02.229 
completed a cut-up chicken and we're

00:08:02.229 --> 00:08:05.730 
completed a cut-up chicken and we're
ready<00:08:02.410> to<00:08:03.270> use<00:08:04.270> it<00:08:04.419> in<00:08:04.510> recipes<00:08:04.960> they<00:08:05.200> call<00:08:05.410> for

00:08:05.730 --> 00:08:05.740 
ready to use it in recipes they call for

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:07.650 
ready to use it in recipes they call for
pieces<00:08:06.340> of<00:08:06.490> chicken<00:08:06.669> or<00:08:07.060> put<00:08:07.330> them<00:08:07.419> on<00:08:07.570> the
