here to form a triangle I've got to come
about<00:01:55.020> down<00:01:55.259> here<00:01:55.700> twist<00:01:56.700> it<00:01:56.850> any<00:01:57.030> way<00:01:57.240> you

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
working in a triangle format but not

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:09.680 
working in a triangle format but not
just<00:02:07.409> kind<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.709> sporadic<00:02:08.209> you<00:02:09.209> just<00:02:09.420> kind<00:02:09.630> of

just kind of sporadic you just kind of
get<00:02:09.810> some<00:02:10.020> evenly<00:02:10.530> so<00:02:10.830> here<00:02:11.040> i<00:02:11.070> got<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.370> form<00:02:11.580> a

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
get some evenly so here i got to form a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.360 
get some evenly so here i got to form a
triangle

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.630 

triangle<00:02:16.140> now<00:02:17.140> I<00:02:17.170> want<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.590> switch<00:02:17.980> stamps

about<00:02:45.100> acrylic<00:02:45.910> you<00:02:46.030> can<00:02:46.239> also<00:02:46.480> see<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:47.170> your

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
about acrylic you can also see that your

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:50.880 
about acrylic you can also see that your
stamp<00:02:48.310> is<00:02:48.519> inked<00:02:48.820> all<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.060> way<00:02:49.440> so<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.500> start
