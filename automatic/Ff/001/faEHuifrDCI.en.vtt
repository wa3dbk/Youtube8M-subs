00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello dear friends today 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:09.650
 again I will and this is my fourth part 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:13.980
 review in bugs in gta san andreas so 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:18.420
 today we talk about three bugs rather 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:22.189
 this is one type of bugs one type of bugs in three 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.199
 ground and this tank is n2 texture 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:29.130
 it turns out walking through textures and 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:31.949
 so first let's get started here 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.020
 open the map and I show you where 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.440
 2 is the first bug is not 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:41.190
 approximately the same way 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.809
 they are in san fierro here they are they 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.260
 here you are going on this tag 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.750
 understood yes here aircraft carrier the bridge here here 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.809
 here and on the bridge from the tank and on the aircraft carrier 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.600
 so let's go there let's put on 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.559
 pause like to lie down rather then to come 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.350
 immediately continue luck and so here 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.989
 still I flew they arrived because 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.140
 that she is a knapsack much faster and those than 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.320
 go here than go by car and here's how 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:13.880
 we see on the reno sci let's i'm in the store 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.310
 knapsack fly up 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.340
 so 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.340
 but 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:30.390
 so you must first go here this 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:35.350
 pause and run run run like me but 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:36.900
 here we need to go down to the hold there 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.400
 where are the boats 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.260
 it is by the way constantly strip come down 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.630
 Immediately continue so here we are 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:49.060
 descended into the hold where should stand 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:52.480
 in the boat at least this bug i 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:55.570
 found in still in the samp ditch like he is like 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.450
 known many there know him here when 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.600
 runs here and then in the sump and your dice 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.040
 and it turns out though to jump but they move 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.470
 that means you don't want to quickly 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.880
 run and jump here I would not want and 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.670
 jumped over here right now I'll show you here 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.740
 jumped here all now later 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.459
 Yalta couldn't find me so much military 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.890
 was standing 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.830
 but the fact is that it is not all possible 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.540
 jump in here higher here again 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.680
 texture under the ground and something else where 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.840
 let's not jump because 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.550
 have to start video first what is not 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.070

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.470
 will be back in the warmth not 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.040
 get out so come back 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.680
 stop so so here everything jumped 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:46.000
 the game is a threat 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:50.069
 don't stop and i like her 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.489
 vip on the stuff 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.640
 you like it here do not swim 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.329
 let's 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:01.599

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.489
 I will continue the video all means I got out but 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:06.219
 for this course I did not have to drown 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.349
 drown well here look ticket for this 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:13.780
 bridge 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:16.150
 so sort of let me remember from where 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.480
 they are not like yes yes yes here we go here 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.240
 over here it's like a triangle 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:25.180
 the end of the grass goes here and so 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:28.030
 but its here already close 5 this for this 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:30.330
 you will need motorcycles any any 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.330
 motorcycle 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.610
 part of the table came 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.350
 Generally this you useful that you 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.120
 I will show you now how you can 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.430
 use skits also not to 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:52.220
 they gave chase for not 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.550
 but so cool for example if you 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:59.120

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:01.580

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:15.210
 and here we all drove 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:19.570

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:22.350
 so give write I can I wish 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.350
 where they are not flowing 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.190
 using the bug that showed in the first 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:31.449

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.540

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:48.550
 you can not only submit to leave that 

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.920
 there is no way 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:54.180
 make such 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:56.750
 put somewhere from the car to here for sure 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.750

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:32.010
 on the map see you show right here yes 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:35.639
 think you know this place is worth it 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:40.080
 exactly these others and here is this place 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:41.669
 we are in it now and so now remember 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.820
 it seems like you have to jump here 

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:48.560
 jump and yes that's all you grab 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:51.360
 textures right in the house look at home 

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:53.039
 just trying to get out of here with the help of 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:55.949
 knapsacks but I know how to do 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:59.639
 the same way out like with 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:02.099
 runs nifiga fails so the bags 

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:06.720
 well that's what emissions you have to client 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:09.240
 a lot of these pieces and these 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.780
 groove can quietly bulge 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.760
 that's even difficult for yourself you can tank 

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:18.960
 useful from the cops can hide here 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:21.750
 and sit and do not know where else he is 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.780
 useful for example in the Sampa if you 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:28.500
 go to the rp server before the homeless 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:32.820
