even<00:00:09.660> though<00:00:09.750> we<00:00:09.900> have<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.050> perfect<00:00:10.530> shelter

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
even though we have a perfect shelter

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.980 
even though we have a perfect shelter
above<00:00:11.100> us<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.400> wood<00:00:11.610> stove<00:00:11.879> unless<00:00:12.690> we<00:00:12.840> have

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
above us in a wood stove unless we have

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.930 
above us in a wood stove unless we have
some<00:00:13.139> insulation<00:00:13.530> underneath<00:00:13.950> us<00:00:14.250> we<00:00:14.639> still

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
some insulation underneath us we still

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.840 
some insulation underneath us we still
get<00:00:15.120> cold<00:00:15.299> so<00:00:16.170> something<00:00:16.650> like<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:17.039> it's<00:00:17.760> a

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
get cold so something like this it's a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.880 
get cold so something like this it's a
reindeer<00:00:18.090> skin<00:00:18.480> rug<00:00:18.690> still<00:00:19.020> used<00:00:19.260> in<00:00:19.440> Finland

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
reindeer skin rug still used in Finland

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.279 
reindeer skin rug still used in Finland
and<00:00:20.039> Sweden<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.970> perfect<00:00:21.449> way<00:00:21.600> to<00:00:21.810> insulate

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
and Sweden the perfect way to insulate

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.500 
and Sweden the perfect way to insulate
yourself<00:00:22.410> from<00:00:22.859> cold<00:00:23.160> ground<00:00:23.400> now<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.270> reason

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510 
yourself from cold ground now the reason

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
yourself from cold ground now the reason
that's<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:24.750> good<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.080> because<00:00:25.350> each

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:25.530 
that's so good is because each

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.820 
that's so good is because each
individual<00:00:26.160> hair<00:00:26.430> on<00:00:26.670> this<00:00:27.030> skin<00:00:27.270> is<00:00:27.830> actually

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
individual hair on this skin is actually

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.920 
individual hair on this skin is actually
hollow<00:00:29.070> and<00:00:29.400> it<00:00:29.760> traps<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.210> layer<00:00:30.240> of<00:00:30.570> warm<00:00:30.750> air

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:30.930 
hollow and it traps a layer of warm air

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.979 
hollow and it traps a layer of warm air
now<00:00:31.800> we<00:00:31.860> can<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:32.309> move<00:00:32.520> on<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.840> more

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
now we can then move on to the more

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.279 
now we can then move on to the more
modern<00:00:34.260> approach<00:00:34.590> this<00:00:35.129> is<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> choice<00:00:35.789> of<00:00:36.000> most

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
modern approach this is a choice of most

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:38.060 
modern approach this is a choice of most
backpackers<00:00:37.289> these<00:00:37.469> days<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:37.829> called<00:00:38.010> a

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
backpackers these days it's called a

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.069 
backpackers these days it's called a
thermistor<00:00:38.730> there<00:00:39.030> are<00:00:39.180> other<00:00:39.359> manufacturers

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
thermistor there are other manufacturers

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.139 
thermistor there are other manufacturers
that<00:00:40.109> make<00:00:40.260> them<00:00:40.530> but<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.399> therm<00:00:41.640> arrest<00:00:41.909> is

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
that make them but the therm arrest is

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.149 
that make them but the therm arrest is
actually<00:00:42.539> a<00:00:42.569> self-inflating<00:00:43.230> mattress<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.980> it

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:44.159 
actually a self-inflating mattress so it

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.910 
actually a self-inflating mattress so it
has<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> foam<00:00:45.030> layer<00:00:45.300> on<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.600> inside<00:00:45.769> nylon<00:00:46.769> on

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
has a foam layer on the inside nylon on

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.069 
has a foam layer on the inside nylon on
the<00:00:47.010> outside<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.609> by<00:00:48.059> opening<00:00:48.449> this<00:00:48.809> valve

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
the outside and by opening this valve

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.129 
the outside and by opening this valve
here<00:00:49.199> we<00:00:49.530> allow<00:00:49.769> air<00:00:50.069> in<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.969> once<00:00:51.960> it's

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:52.139 
here we allow air in and that once it's

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:54.590 
here we allow air in and that once it's
closed<00:00:52.499> up<00:00:52.679> again<00:00:52.949> that<00:00:53.550> traps<00:00:54.089> a<00:00:54.239> layer<00:00:54.269> of

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
closed up again that traps a layer of

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.000 
closed up again that traps a layer of
air<00:00:54.719> which<00:00:54.899> insulates<00:00:55.260> us<00:00:55.499> from<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.829> ground

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
air which insulates us from the ground

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.319 
air which insulates us from the ground
it's<00:00:56.280> also<00:00:56.399> one<00:00:56.639> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.760> most<00:00:56.940> comfortable

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
it's also one of the most comfortable

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.119 
it's also one of the most comfortable
beds<00:00:57.929> that<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.199> can<00:00:58.350> have<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.799> outdoors

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
beds that you can have in the outdoors

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.700 
beds that you can have in the outdoors
as<00:00:59.309> well<00:00:59.519> far<00:01:00.479> preferable<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.049> the

as well far preferable to the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
something like that a really good piece

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.740 
something like that a really good piece
of<00:01:28.920> kit<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.789> just<00:01:29.969> need<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.180> think<00:01:30.270> about<00:01:30.420> what

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
of kit we just need to think about what

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.420 
of kit we just need to think about what
sort<00:01:30.899> of<00:01:30.990> sleeping<00:01:31.380> bag<00:01:31.530> we<00:01:31.680> use<00:01:31.859> now

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
sort of sleeping bag we use now

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.310 
sort of sleeping bag we use now
traditionally<00:01:33.210> people<00:01:33.329> use<00:01:33.630> blankets<00:01:34.079> but

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
traditionally people use blankets but

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.749 
traditionally people use blankets but
the<00:01:34.409> obvious<00:01:34.710> problem<00:01:35.039> with<00:01:35.159> blankets<00:01:35.579> is

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the obvious problem with blankets is

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.240 
the obvious problem with blankets is
firstly<00:01:36.179> that<00:01:36.329> they're<00:01:36.479> very<00:01:36.630> heavy<00:01:37.039> also<00:01:38.039> a

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
firstly that they're very heavy also a

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.160 
firstly that they're very heavy also a
blanket<00:01:38.909> doesn't<00:01:39.119> enclose<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.780> all<00:01:39.960> the<00:01:40.049> way

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
blanket doesn't enclose you all the way

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.959 
blanket doesn't enclose you all the way
around<00:01:40.469> so<00:01:40.590> modern<00:01:40.979> sleeping<00:01:41.460> bags<00:01:41.670> are<00:01:41.850> by

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:41.969 
around so modern sleeping bags are by

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.969 
around so modern sleeping bags are by
far<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.420> best<00:01:42.630> option<00:01:42.810> this<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.679> modern

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
far the best option this is a modern

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.099 
far the best option this is a modern
mummy<00:01:44.429> shaped<00:01:44.729> sleeping<00:01:45.090> bag<00:01:45.270> which<00:01:45.899> has<00:01:46.079> a

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
mummy shaped sleeping bag which has a

mummy shaped sleeping bag which has a
synthetic<00:01:46.770> high-tech<00:01:47.640> insulation<00:01:48.299> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
synthetic high-tech insulation that

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
you're going to keep it dry so it's

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.849 
you're going to keep it dry so it's
great<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.090> you're<00:01:57.179> mountaineering<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.770> you

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:58.859 
great if you're mountaineering and you

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:00.139 
great if you're mountaineering and you
can<00:01:59.009> guarantee<00:01:59.460> you're<00:01:59.640> not<00:01:59.670> gonna<00:01:59.880> get<00:02:00.060> it

can guarantee you're not gonna get it

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:02.810 
can guarantee you're not gonna get it
wet<00:02:00.299> but<00:02:00.539> feather<00:02:01.140> down<00:02:01.380> does<00:02:02.219> lose<00:02:02.520> all<00:02:02.700> its

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
wet but feather down does lose all its

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.309 
wet but feather down does lose all its
insulation<00:02:03.420> properties<00:02:03.600> when<00:02:03.960> it's<00:02:04.079> wet

00:02:04.309 --> 00:02:04.319 
insulation properties when it's wet

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:06.289 
insulation properties when it's wet
whereas<00:02:05.100> something<00:02:05.579> with<00:02:05.789> synthetic

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
whereas something with synthetic

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.999 
whereas something with synthetic
materials<00:02:06.719> like<00:02:06.749> this<00:02:07.020> so<00:02:07.499> much<00:02:07.770> better

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
materials like this so much better

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.490 
materials like this so much better
option<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.490> always<00:02:09.330> prefer<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> central<00:02:10.229> zipper

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
option I always prefer a central zipper

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.330 
option I always prefer a central zipper
which<00:02:10.740> means<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.130> we<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:11.370> get<00:02:11.520> out<00:02:11.640> just<00:02:12.330> by

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
which means that we can get out just by

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.250 
which means that we can get out just by
pulling<00:02:14.340> open<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.760> front<00:02:15.030> and<00:02:15.810> we<00:02:15.870> can<00:02:15.900> escape

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
pulling open the front and we can escape

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.710 
pulling open the front and we can escape
that<00:02:16.440> way<00:02:16.880> so<00:02:17.880> if<00:02:18.000> there's<00:02:18.150> a<00:02:18.210> problem<00:02:18.420> we<00:02:18.630> have

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
that way so if there's a problem we have

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:19.880 
that way so if there's a problem we have
to<00:02:18.810> get<00:02:18.930> up<00:02:19.020> quickly<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.560> middle<00:02:19.740> of<00:02:19.830> the

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
to get up quickly in the middle of the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:36.350 
to get up quickly in the middle of the
night<00:02:20.040> that's<00:02:20.580> a
