crazy love that really inspired and

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.700 
crazy love that really inspired and
challenged<00:00:09.240> us<00:00:09.360> in<00:00:09.570> some<00:00:10.019> pretty<00:00:10.200> deep<00:00:10.440> ways

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
challenged us in some pretty deep ways

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.640 
challenged us in some pretty deep ways
to<00:00:11.130> step<00:00:11.730> out<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.540> boat<00:00:12.690> so<00:00:12.750> to<00:00:12.960> speak<00:00:13.320> and

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
to step out of the boat so to speak and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.680 
to step out of the boat so to speak and
to<00:00:13.950> trust<00:00:14.340> God<00:00:14.549> in<00:00:14.730> some<00:00:14.880> areas<00:00:15.150> so<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.389> felt

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
to trust God in some areas so I felt

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.599 
to trust God in some areas so I felt
like<00:00:15.929> God<00:00:16.109> was<00:00:16.350> saying<00:00:16.379> that<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.400> were<00:00:17.520> to

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
like God was saying that we were to

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.820 
like God was saying that we were to
adopt<00:00:17.820> again<00:00:18.029> so<00:00:18.480> we<00:00:18.630> started<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.020> process<00:00:19.199> to

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
adopt again so we started the process to

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.519 
adopt again so we started the process to
adopt<00:00:20.340> and<00:00:20.699> early<00:00:21.539> on<00:00:21.660> it<00:00:21.869> was<00:00:22.020> thinking<00:00:22.500> that

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
adopt and early on it was thinking that

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:23.960 
adopt and early on it was thinking that
maybe<00:00:22.740> we<00:00:22.949> were<00:00:23.010> gonna<00:00:23.160> adopt<00:00:23.250> from<00:00:23.580> foster

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970
