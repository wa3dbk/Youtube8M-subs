00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:10.050
 Hello everyone, Vanya Ostapenko 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.170
 bucket point ru and a little late for 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.549
 us on the review meizu m2 note 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.109
 first generation smartphone arbitrariness 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.570
 a little sensation in the world of big 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.920
 gadgets do not agree every day 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.930
 A cheap device comes out with 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.600
 the characteristics of the flagship is quite good 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.699
 camera and cool user display 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.500
 it was like but meizu seems 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.480
 guess what is not profitable will do 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.820
 m2 note able to compete with 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.890
 own flagship mx5 and so in 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.200
 Novelty decided to slightly cut power 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.340
 why is the second version in the end everything 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.270
 it turned out to be more interesting 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.829
 predecessor about this in order on 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.300
 first glance it may seem that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.850
 the appearance of the device is almost not 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.860
 changed all the same large dimensions all 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.640
 the same plastic back cover and black 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.550
 front panel 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.649
 but it is only at first glance at the very 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.469
 In fact, meizu m2 note can distinguish three 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:00.629
 Significant differences in the first sensor 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.760
 navigation gave way to mechanical position 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.460
 keys which combined in itself immediately 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.560
 two gestures home and back in this way 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.390
 saving and temporarily interaction with 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.360
 a gadget and a strip of several dozen 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.610
 pixels and user nerves on the net 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.650
 a lot of controversy over the beauty of the key and 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.850
 and the relevance and traditions of maze but 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.320
 undoubtedly one is more convenient 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.090
 the second important difference is the button 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.490
 unlocking brought to the left side 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.770
 rather controversial decision rather 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.020
 a compromise for right-handers is all 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.520
 still not the best option with the other 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.350
 the parties will still use everyone 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.990
 double tap unlocking 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.880
 in the third to the standard range of fun 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.189
 glossy colors added matt 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.530
 gray and that's it and recommend it to 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.070
 buying only for sulfur model can 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.689
 firmly grasp and not be afraid to drop 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.299
 to a less significant change is worth 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:54.140
 include a decrease in thickness as much as 0.2 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:57.000
 millimeter and more rounded edges 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.770
 like a trifle and however coupled with a matt 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.340
 plastic they give an impressive effect 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.509
 convenience compared to m1 laptop 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.700
 finally meizu decided to please 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.680
 extended range i.e. frequencies and 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.060
 Now in Russia, the smartphone works on 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.310
 4g speeds 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.550
 And in one of the slots, everyone can now 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.310
 install memory card 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.209
 We go further and then we have a display and here 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.030
 there are two news 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.069
 bad and good is good 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.569
 the fact that the matrix put tighter five s 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.450
 half inches and ps 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:29.430
 Full hd resolution in the first model 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.769
 the display has established itself as the best 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.349
 budget segment bright saturated 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.069
 colors high detail accurate 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.590
 calibration 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.569
 and good viewing angles are all about m2 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.640
 The only thing I did not like was white 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.950
 color is it here some kind of dirty gray 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.530
 either i was just unlucky with the instance 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.569
 And even cheaper smartphone led to 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:51.209
 replacement of protective glass gorilla glass 3 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.370
 on branded dragon trail x whatever 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.160
 dragon it was there but oleophobic 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.580
 the cover here is not an asset we turn over 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.980
 smartphone and relieved sigh though 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.170
 here would not cut down the camera module 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.930
 remained the same good old sensor 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.390
 samsung with aperture 22 and resolution 13 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.160
 megapixels daylight hours and at 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.140
 good lighting shots are obtained 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.970
 very good with good 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.760
 detail and quality transfer 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.260
 colors but with the onset 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.310
 twilight is better not to use i'm done 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.310
 all for photography 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.380
 too much noise interface 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.180
 applications similar to ios 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.950
 and indeed branded flyme shell 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.709
 seeks to copy the look 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.540
 older brother oddly enough but 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.910
 call such an experience a bad language not 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.130
 the developers are turning quite well 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.769
 tried and managed to unite in flyme 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.739
 os simplicity and brevity and beauty ios 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.600
 with customization capabilities android 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:47.549
 It turned out a kind of Frankenstein does not seem 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.019
 on any of the operating systems and at that 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:52.709
 same time absorbed the best 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.540
 developments of both and here we smoothly approached 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.380
 to the performance issue of this 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.750
 frankenstein 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:00.209
 After all, the smartphone is cheaper but also power 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.190
 cut the boring numbers leave 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.650
 online store more curious 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:07.470
 real experience with him was pretty 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.359
 interesting in antutu the difference is expressed in 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.030
 tens of thousands of parrots are not for the best 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:14.220
 side when you run heavy games in 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.230
 increasing lags when scrolling 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.420
 large sites less smoothness 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:20.530
 but it costs only a second to remember the price 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.850
 meizu m2 note 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.690
 his appointment claim fall away 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.640
 valid with standard mode 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.460
 work that is generally not in the social networks 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.160
 calls and sms browsers smartphone 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:35.560
 It works very quickly and smoothly and in fact 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.860
 all these actions make up 90 percent 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.990
 the time of communication with the gadget user 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.490
 so is it worth buying meizu m2 note ii 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.560
 all the more go to him from the first 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.150
 generations 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.370
 if the first question is a clear answer 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:51.040
 yes with the second is not so simple with 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:54.010
 one side appeared lte support and 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:56.440
 memory cards and convenient keys but with 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.800
 another if you are comfortable with network speed 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.350
 if 16 or 32 gigabytes is enough 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.530
 Control buttons of the gestures replaced 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.400
 There is no special meaning in changing devices. 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.410
 anyways 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.880
 meizu m2 note can be called one of 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.070
 best budget smartphones 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.530
 for a little money you get a phablet 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:16.510
 powerful enough characteristics 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:18.670
 cool 4g display and 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.130
 constant updates good 

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:22.900
 operating system and creeping up 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:26.890
 the dollar exchange rate as if stirs interest 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:30.930
 to the device with you was Vanya Ostapenko 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.930
 with droid dot ru see you
