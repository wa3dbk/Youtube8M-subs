00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.039
 i am howard 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:12.199
 a 21 year old 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:14.209
 while in rotterdam 

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:16.259
 I work in a clothing store 

00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.259
 I noticed that I have the courage and I keep working 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:24.659
 present there 

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.939
 8 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.130
 I chose her 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.900
 to do the bicycle with clothing 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.080
 so basically a fashion course 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.710
 work in the clothing store 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:39.800
 it's only about actual dressing in a year 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.830
 we still believe in flanders 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.210
 people are often giving advice as to what to get there 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.810
 very often people say the idea came up 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.390
 not so long ago in the perpetrator forward and hurt twice if you were even there 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.390
 moments later that most 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.500
 closed with four possible and I think normal clothing is actually very good 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:08.160
 important point Ned well 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.700
 deventer and hup them 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.630
 23 10 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.230
 line Amsterdam runs 

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.460
 of course known 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.810
 hand in hand 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:28.970
 with after-runs and rightly and rightly several vintage and 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.670
 Christians in Turkey among women 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500
 dwm the man from breda in your shoes and bags 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.290
 amatorski own strange thought 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.120
 has been given up for me 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.760
 with the spring beginning of spring then we open here on the prinsengracht and then 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.170
 we actually have a kind of atelier political shop where we 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:54.170
 can only walk in and then he is crazy 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.260
 ned 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.010
 do you still know how to manage 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.910
 with this game only two points I had hoped in another way difficult point 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.059
 around the ears 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:13.189
 and then you start looking for a special for free 

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:16.389
 I am satisfied with my clog 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:19.979
 oxfam something special unique experience 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:24.349
 and looking like a small wine shop with fallen pvda from it 

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.189
 instrument is the feeling that you have something special now I am very happy with it 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.399
 a little girl from maaseik has gelsenkirchen 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:38.079
 then it keeps on recovering for a while and otherwise the knife is stuck to purple plus copy 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.079
 friends are no longer kind of greed 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:48.069
 and further he had to fight because you then grab minority hefty debts 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.959
 to find the net 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:51.649
 the device 

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:56.169
 9 11 but if you don't find something special in principle a good deal 

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:03.389
 look 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.680
 reportedly the army deployed for the game since he got hit over 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.189
 being old 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.449
 and that's for me 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:14.049
 what I really haven't been smart 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.509
 certain clothes 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.299
 he wrong way to combine steve mandanda 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.299
 therefore they were back with orange wubbo ockels and then some 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:24.979
 preud'homme afterwards 

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:30.429
 houseboats 6 for 

00:03:30.429 --> 00:03:33.839
 CDs 

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:37.289
 last week I am confident 

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:41.659
 I already have where the food is smashed I have a nipple piercing and 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:42.859
 one from the area 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.399
 What I did want to say Marc Brys is to have a free one but this already said 

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:48.329
 says maertens 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.329
 Fighting for fifty years was that the nipple piercing says Ryanair 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.319
 the only place where in canteens on sand 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:56.549
 the army was expelled 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.519
 it seems that the car was thinking about the campaign for a long time only from me 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.749
 no matter what exactly I wanted to say 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:04.749
 I came out last week with a previous week 

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:11.919
 enter the Iranian government 

00:04:11.919 --> 00:04:14.759
 the own two well keeps going 

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:15.900
 in group f 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.040
 about the first week of August a the dutch team how a city of 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.650
 the netherlands and great britain has been to take steps rather than to 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.210
 get it 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.029
 what a recognition from their aena employer research shows that he is his own 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.139
 the sweden and those who do not understand this then turn it on again 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.500
 We have lived here and especially from Paris I think it is great but that is 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:41.900
 not going to behave. The challenge and said Herman 

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:44.460
 think it's a bit like that 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:46.120
 I am then to contain it 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.629
 that the elderly 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:51.360
 not what is being managed now 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.680
 that has also affected a lot of girls but I am looking at my opinion 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.860
 clothing or 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.860
 wife a bit my old kind 

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:06.659
 Every year, subsidy receives a great deal of practical experience 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.430
 It is of course help the gym in the Netherlands I can just 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.330
 really to itself 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.529
 it is also very crazy not us every time you get away and bring 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:29.099
 the branches 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:32.099
 no I am sure 4 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.759
 it is but it is surprising for me also Sunday there is no contact anymore 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.789
 are not that they do not always get used to it 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.520
 it something else and that is not possible 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.229
 when i was here i am 

00:05:48.229 --> 00:05:51.680
 ubuntu says bernadette unrecognizable 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.680
 renger 

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:04.909
 After the Federal Reserve Bank Netherlands went reasonably well 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.059
 the board is important to everyone for 5 cents only 

00:06:08.059 --> 00:06:10.249
 comment what i say however 

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:13.249
 the movie he is staying 

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:15.819
 into trouble 

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:19.099
 because with others we have a lot of wrong people doing especially with boys 

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:19.860
 it doesn't 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.539
 I will just say the most important 

00:06:21.539 --> 00:06:22.729
 9 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.189
 the company say several cars and things like that 

00:06:26.189 --> 00:06:29.189
 but I do not clear my father of their clothing 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:33.749
 no, but backwards and backgrounds influence but in giving do not mean say 

00:06:34.999 --> 00:06:37.990
 take that says Marc van 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.460
 were paying middle ages 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.729
 say comment on my clothing 

00:06:42.729 --> 00:06:46.839
 if I do not become very zawiyah so that they came so deeply that just like that 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.110
 I do not mind 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.180
 This is my choice to say Ajax was the time to be as other people say 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.080
 not 

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.289
 aspiring 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:58.300
 that says mania can go pretty 

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:00.809
 campus it doesn't make me lose much 

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:11.689
 9 and that failed to take don't give up 

00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:14.520
 that the parents with a little bit of that 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.320
 that also from art and culture or petercam 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.520
 Do you actually already know the man's volunteer skills 

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:27.100
 last ten years director peter de bruijn the score and the battle zone ruiz 

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:32.430
 However, this ez that gets to hear you must disconnect from it 

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:33.849
 management team 

00:07:33.849 --> 00:07:36.849
 constantly offered many women and gay 

00:07:37.509 --> 00:07:38.860
 neither 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:42.159
 driven an engineering net and you are going to do this on the horticultural street 

00:07:43.649 --> 00:07:45.939
 we didn't care much 

00:07:45.939 --> 00:07:47.629
 they do that 

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:57.909
 gerets emmen
