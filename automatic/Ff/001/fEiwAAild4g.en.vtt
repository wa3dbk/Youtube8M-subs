hormonal status right we'll talk about
later<00:02:35.190> okay<00:02:35.820> so<00:02:35.880> this<00:02:36.660> by<00:02:37.140> itself<00:02:37.410> is<00:02:37.710> already

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
later okay so this by itself is already

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.040 
later okay so this by itself is already
better<00:02:38.700> than<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.000> body<00:02:39.180> then<00:02:39.570> sorry<00:02:39.810> not<00:02:39.959> the

anything about their muscle right we
know<00:03:17.670> we<00:03:17.910> haven't<00:03:18.060> measured<00:03:18.239> if<00:03:18.690> we<00:03:19.080> use<00:03:19.260> the

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
know we haven't measured if we use the

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:21.890 
know we haven't measured if we use the
district<00:03:20.190> conference<00:03:20.370> let's<00:03:21.330> say<00:03:21.450> one<00:03:21.720> week

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
district conference let's say one week

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.470 
district conference let's say one week
there<00:03:22.170> those<00:03:22.799> conference<00:03:23.220> is<00:03:23.340> 25<00:03:23.880> centimeters

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
there those conference is 25 centimeters

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.509 
there those conference is 25 centimeters
the<00:03:24.959> next<00:03:25.230> week<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.500> still<00:03:25.680> 25<00:03:26.040> centimeters

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
the next week is still 25 centimeters

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:29.810 
the next week is still 25 centimeters
but<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.330> calipers<00:03:27.840> went<00:03:28.830> down<00:03:29.040> that<00:03:29.610> means

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
but the calipers went down that means

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.550 
but the calipers went down that means
you<00:03:29.910> gain<00:03:30.120> muscle<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.630> lost<00:03:30.989> out<00:03:31.200> at<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.380> same

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
you gain muscle and lost out at the same

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.680 
you gain muscle and lost out at the same
time<00:03:31.590> this<00:03:32.430> gives<00:03:32.610> you<00:03:32.670> a<00:03:32.700> much<00:03:32.910> more<00:03:32.970> precise

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
time this gives you a much more precise

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.780 
time this gives you a much more precise
picture<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.560> exactly<00:03:34.950> how<00:03:35.160> your<00:03:35.340> training<00:03:35.519> and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
picture of exactly how your training and

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.190 
picture of exactly how your training and
diet<00:03:36.030> are<00:03:36.239> working<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.630> combination<00:03:37.080> with

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
diet are working in combination with

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.289 
diet are working in combination with
each<00:03:37.290> other<00:03:37.500> right<00:03:38.040> so<00:03:38.370> how<00:03:38.640> is<00:03:38.820> this

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
each other right so how is this

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.979 
each other right so how is this
different<00:03:39.660> from<00:03:40.820> BMI<00:03:41.820> or<00:03:41.850> body<00:03:42.030> mass<00:03:42.420> index

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
different from BMI or body mass index

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.830 
different from BMI or body mass index
okay<00:03:43.290> body<00:03:43.920> mass<00:03:44.190> index<00:03:44.610> for<00:03:45.330> people<00:03:45.750> who

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
okay body mass index for people who

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.810 
okay body mass index for people who
don't<00:03:45.989> know<00:03:46.140> body<00:03:46.440> mass<00:03:46.950> index<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.519> your

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
don't know body mass index is your

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.759 
don't know body mass index is your
weight<00:03:48.000> in<00:03:48.180> kilograms<00:03:48.440> divided<00:03:49.440> by<00:03:49.650> your

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
weight in kilograms divided by your

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:51.680 
weight in kilograms divided by your
height<00:03:49.830> in<00:03:50.220> meters<00:03:50.489> squared<00:03:50.910> okay

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
height in meters squared okay

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.330 
height in meters squared okay
body<00:03:51.989> mass<00:03:52.200> index<00:03:52.530> tells<00:03:52.739> you<00:03:52.860> nothing<00:03:53.100> about

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
body mass index tells you nothing about

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.160 
body mass index tells you nothing about
your<00:03:53.519> body<00:03:53.760> fat<00:03:53.970> percentage<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.660> stratifies

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
your body fat percentage it stratifies

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:56.810 
your body fat percentage it stratifies
you<00:03:55.320> in<00:03:55.410> two<00:03:55.500> categories

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
you in two categories

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.400 
you in two categories
and<00:03:57.180> here's<00:03:57.540> why<00:03:57.660> they<00:03:57.810> found<00:03:58.019> this<00:03:58.110> early

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:58.410 
and here's why they found this early

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.500 
and here's why they found this early
good<00:03:58.560> guy<00:03:59.310> like<00:03:59.489> Arnold<00:03:59.790> Schwarzenegger<00:03:59.970> big

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
have too much body fat right now that's

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.780 
have too much body fat right now that's
really<00:04:09.239> only<00:04:09.329> 1%<00:04:09.690> of<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:09.959> population<00:04:10.700> for<00:04:11.700> the

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
other 99% would it work well still no

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.060 
other 99% would it work well still no
here's<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.540> biggest<00:04:15.930> risk<00:04:16.140> of<00:04:16.260> BMI<00:04:16.680> body<00:04:16.919> mass

here's the biggest risk of BMI body mass

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.610 
here's the biggest risk of BMI body mass
index<00:04:17.609> it<00:04:18.030> does<00:04:18.570> not<00:04:18.750> catch<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.229> people<00:04:19.500> who

are at their ideal weight I have way too
much<00:04:21.570> body<00:04:21.750> fat<00:04:21.900> case<00:04:22.800> in<00:04:22.979> point<00:04:23.160> I<00:04:23.490> had<00:04:23.820> a

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:23.849 
much body fat case in point I had a

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:26.060 
much body fat case in point I had a
client<00:04:24.120> who<00:04:24.300> was<00:04:24.360> five<00:04:25.200> foot<00:04:25.410> nine<00:04:25.560> and<00:04:25.800> a

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
client who was five foot nine and a

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.420 
client who was five foot nine and a
hundred

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
hundred

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.300 
hundred
and<00:04:26.550> 48<00:04:27.330> pounds<00:04:27.560> perfectly<00:04:28.560> normal<00:04:28.889> you<00:04:29.160> look

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310 
and 48 pounds perfectly normal you look

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:31.280 
and 48 pounds perfectly normal you look
at<00:04:29.430> her<00:04:29.610> but<00:04:30.090> you<00:04:30.330> measure<00:04:30.479> her<00:04:30.660> body<00:04:30.840> fat<00:04:31.050> it's

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.290 
at her but you measure her body fat it's

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.370 
at her but you measure her body fat it's
actually<00:04:31.590> 40%<00:04:32.449> so<00:04:33.449> her<00:04:33.570> muscle<00:04:33.750> has<00:04:33.990> gone<00:04:34.169> down

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
actually 40% so her muscle has gone down

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.779 
actually 40% so her muscle has gone down
so<00:04:34.590> much<00:04:34.620> and<00:04:34.889> her<00:04:34.949> fat<00:04:35.130> has<00:04:35.250> gone<00:04:35.400> down<00:04:35.610> so

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:35.789 
so much and her fat has gone down so

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.969 
so much and her fat has gone down so
much<00:04:35.940> that<00:04:36.000> her<00:04:36.509> total<00:04:36.990> weight<00:04:37.139> well<00:04:37.740> hasn't

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 
much that her total weight well hasn't

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.320 
much that her total weight well hasn't
really<00:04:38.220> changed<00:04:38.250> much<00:04:38.699> but<00:04:38.910> it<00:04:39.060> hasn't

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
really changed much but it hasn't

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.300 
really changed much but it hasn't
captured<00:04:39.720> what's<00:04:40.500> really<00:04:40.770> going<00:04:40.949> on<00:04:41.039> inside

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
captured what's really going on inside

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.950 
captured what's really going on inside
her<00:04:41.490> body<00:04:41.610> right<00:04:41.880> so<00:04:42.090> that<00:04:42.240> hundred<00:04:42.570> and<00:04:42.660> forty

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
her body right so that hundred and forty

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.350 
her body right so that hundred and forty
eight<00:04:42.990> pounds<00:04:43.560> is<00:04:43.710> more<00:04:44.310> fat<00:04:44.610> than<00:04:44.850> muscle<00:04:45.270> and

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
eight pounds is more fat than muscle and

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.659 
eight pounds is more fat than muscle and
you<00:04:45.479> want<00:04:45.660> more<00:04:45.840> muscle<00:04:46.229> than<00:04:46.259> fat<00:04:46.560> exactly<00:04:47.250> so

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:47.669 
you want more muscle than fat exactly so

00:04:47.669 --> 00:04:49.010 
you want more muscle than fat exactly so
that's<00:04:47.850> that's<00:04:48.270> why<00:04:48.479> it's<00:04:48.630> very<00:04:48.810> very

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.020 
that's that's why it's very very

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.290 
that's that's why it's very very
important<00:04:49.350> to<00:04:49.440> forget<00:04:49.830> about<00:04:49.860> BMI<00:04:50.370> I<00:04:50.639> doesn't

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
important to forget about BMI I doesn't

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:53.360 
important to forget about BMI I doesn't
mean<00:04:51.509> too<00:04:51.690> much<00:04:51.810> I<00:04:52.110> stick<00:04:52.830> with<00:04:52.860> a<00:04:53.009> body<00:04:53.220> fat

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
mean too much I stick with a body fat

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.409 
mean too much I stick with a body fat
scale<00:04:53.699> and<00:04:53.910> so<00:04:54.210> if<00:04:55.080> for<00:04:55.440> the<00:04:55.560> very<00:04:55.800> very

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
scale and so if for the very very

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.060 
scale and so if for the very very
hands-off<00:04:57.419> approach<00:04:57.600> or<00:04:58.169> if<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.740> want<00:04:58.919> a

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
hands-off approach or if you want a

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.740 
hands-off approach or if you want a
hands-on<00:04:59.340> approach<00:04:59.490> use<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.479> skin<00:05:00.660> fold

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
hands-on approach use the skin fold

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.540 
hands-on approach use the skin fold
caliper<00:05:00.870> in<00:05:01.380> combination<00:05:02.100> with<00:05:02.430> her

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
caliper in combination with her

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.540 
caliper in combination with her
conferences<00:05:03.060> okay<00:05:03.740> we've<00:05:04.740> got<00:05:04.979> Jade<00:05:05.250> from

Aurora on the line hi Jane
hi<00:05:08.010> do<00:05:08.550> you<00:05:08.580> have<00:05:08.639> a<00:05:08.760> question<00:05:08.910> for<00:05:09.270> Igor<00:05:09.510> um

00:05:10.279 --> 00:05:10.289 
hi do you have a question for Igor um

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:13.969 
hi do you have a question for Igor um
yeah<00:05:11.160> actually<00:05:11.460> I<00:05:11.820> do<00:05:12.289> you<00:05:13.289> know<00:05:13.380> what<00:05:13.560> I'm<00:05:13.710> not

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
yeah actually I do you know what I'm not

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.180 
yeah actually I do you know what I'm not
concerned<00:05:14.490> much<00:05:14.850> about<00:05:15.270> my<00:05:15.510> weight<00:05:16.190> because

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:17.190 
concerned much about my weight because

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.520 
concerned much about my weight because
it<00:05:17.729> seems<00:05:17.970> like<00:05:18.180> it's<00:05:18.510> not<00:05:18.750> falling<00:05:19.229> down<00:05:19.260> but

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
it seems like it's not falling down but

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.480 
it seems like it's not falling down but
it's<00:05:19.710> growing<00:05:23.330> muscles<00:05:24.330> but<00:05:24.990> how<00:05:25.770> do<00:05:25.830> I<00:05:26.130> find

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
it's growing muscles but how do I find

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.150 
it's growing muscles but how do I find
out<00:05:26.820> about<00:05:26.970> how<00:05:27.599> much<00:05:27.810> fun<00:05:28.169> do<00:05:28.440> I<00:05:28.470> have<00:05:28.800> on<00:05:28.830> my

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
out about how much fun do I have on my

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.629 
out about how much fun do I have on my
body<00:05:29.389> I've<00:05:30.389> heard<00:05:30.780> about<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.320> fat<00:05:31.590> scales<00:05:32.400> in

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 
body I've heard about the fat scales in

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.960 
body I've heard about the fat scales in
the<00:05:32.820> jeans<00:05:33.240> are<00:05:33.900> being<00:05:34.139> good<00:05:34.970> here's

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:35.970 
the jeans are being good here's

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:37.550 
the jeans are being good here's
something<00:05:36.300> very<00:05:36.330> interesting<00:05:36.570> those<00:05:37.260> fast

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
something very interesting those fast

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.930 
something very interesting those fast
skills<00:05:37.860> so<00:05:38.280> it's<00:05:38.430> not<00:05:38.550> just<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:38.820> regular

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:38.940 
skills so it's not just the regular

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.490 
skills so it's not just the regular
bathroom<00:05:39.360> scale<00:05:39.690> it's<00:05:39.900> just<00:05:40.110> scale<00:05:40.349> if<00:05:40.470> you

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
bathroom scale it's just scale if you

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.439 
bathroom scale it's just scale if you
say<00:05:40.800> that<00:05:40.919> you<00:05:41.070> step<00:05:41.310> on<00:05:41.460> there<00:05:42.240> is<00:05:42.330> actually

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
say that you step on there is actually

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.600 
say that you step on there is actually
electrodes<00:05:42.960> on<00:05:43.110> the<00:05:43.139> bottom<00:05:43.560> and<00:05:43.800> based<00:05:44.370> on

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
electrodes on the bottom and based on

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.129 
electrodes on the bottom and based on
how<00:05:44.820> quickly<00:05:45.090> the<00:05:45.330> electricity<00:05:45.840> gets<00:05:45.960> through

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:46.139 
how quickly the electricity gets through

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:47.659 
how quickly the electricity gets through
your<00:05:46.229> body<00:05:46.440> it<00:05:46.919> tells<00:05:47.130> you<00:05:47.220> how<00:05:47.310> much<00:05:47.400> fat<00:05:47.639> you

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
your body it tells you how much fat you

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.760 
your body it tells you how much fat you
have<00:05:47.820> the<00:05:48.539> theory<00:05:49.020> behind<00:05:49.199> that<00:05:49.470> is<00:05:49.590> that

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:49.770 
have the theory behind that is that

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.980 
have the theory behind that is that
electricity<00:05:50.729> travels<00:05:50.909> slower<00:05:51.510> through<00:05:51.720> fat

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
electricity travels slower through fat

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.529 
electricity travels slower through fat
and<00:05:52.229> then<00:05:52.320> through<00:05:52.500> muscle<00:05:53.060> true<00:05:54.060> assumption

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:54.539 
and then through muscle true assumption

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:56.360 
and then through muscle true assumption
but<00:05:54.810> it's<00:05:55.380> not<00:05:55.530> a<00:05:55.560> so<00:05:55.860> the<00:05:56.010> most<00:05:56.159> accurate

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:56.370 
but it's not a so the most accurate

00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:59.839 
but it's not a so the most accurate
thing<00:05:56.760> because<00:05:57.060> it's<00:05:57.240> very<00:05:57.510> very<00:05:58.729> governed<00:05:59.729> by

00:05:59.839 --> 00:05:59.849 
thing because it's very very governed by

00:05:59.849 --> 00:06:02.390 
thing because it's very very governed by
which<00:06:00.150> the<00:06:00.750> water<00:06:00.900> fluctuation<00:06:01.530> so<00:06:01.770> if<00:06:02.039> you

00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:02.400 
which the water fluctuation so if you

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:04.250 
which the water fluctuation so if you
actually<00:06:02.820> step<00:06:03.000> on<00:06:03.180> the<00:06:03.270> scale

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:04.260 
actually step on the scale

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.110 
actually step on the scale

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
hour or later it's going to be

hour or later it's going to be
completely<00:06:11.039> different<00:06:12.260> now<00:06:13.260> provided<00:06:13.949> that

completely different now provided that

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.350 
completely different now provided that
you<00:06:14.250> measure<00:06:14.400> yourself<00:06:14.550> at<00:06:14.849> the<00:06:14.909> same<00:06:15.120> time

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 
you measure yourself at the same time

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.960 
you measure yourself at the same time
every<00:06:15.930> day<00:06:16.070> you're<00:06:17.070> going<00:06:17.220> to<00:06:17.340> get<00:06:17.520> a<00:06:17.580> fairly

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:17.970 
every day you're going to get a fairly

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.909 
every day you're going to get a fairly
accurate<00:06:18.240> picture<00:06:18.720> of<00:06:18.750> sorry<00:06:19.470> not<00:06:19.590> every<00:06:19.800> day

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
accurate picture of sorry not every day

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:21.260 
accurate picture of sorry not every day
every<00:06:20.550> every<00:06:20.760> time<00:06:20.940> you<00:06:21.060> weigh<00:06:21.150> yourself

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
every every time you weigh yourself

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.640 
every every time you weigh yourself
you're<00:06:21.750> going<00:06:21.960> to<00:06:22.050> get<00:06:22.139> a<00:06:22.169> fairly<00:06:22.409> accurate

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
you're going to get a fairly accurate

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.620 
you're going to get a fairly accurate
picture<00:06:23.130> of<00:06:23.159> your<00:06:23.280> body<00:06:23.460> fat<00:06:23.639> percentage<00:06:23.669> but

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:24.630 
picture of your body fat percentage but

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:26.180 
picture of your body fat percentage but
again<00:06:24.900> it<00:06:25.349> doesn't<00:06:25.590> tell<00:06:25.800> you<00:06:25.889> where<00:06:26.099> your

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:26.190 
again it doesn't tell you where your

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:28.430 
again it doesn't tell you where your
body<00:06:26.370> fat<00:06:26.580> is<00:06:26.669> stored<00:06:26.849> furthermore<00:06:27.840> because

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:28.440 
body fat is stored furthermore because

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.680 
body fat is stored furthermore because
electricity<00:06:28.919> takes<00:06:29.760> the<00:06:29.880> shortest<00:06:30.240> distance

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:30.690 
electricity takes the shortest distance

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:32.240 
electricity takes the shortest distance
to<00:06:30.810> to<00:06:31.169> get<00:06:31.289> around<00:06:31.500> it's<00:06:31.770> just<00:06:31.919> going<00:06:32.070> to<00:06:32.190> go

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:32.250 
to to get around it's just going to go

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.219 
to to get around it's just going to go
up<00:06:32.430> one<00:06:32.639> leg<00:06:32.789> and<00:06:32.909> down<00:06:33.060> the<00:06:33.210> other<00:06:33.240> so<00:06:33.870> it<00:06:34.020> only

00:06:34.219 --> 00:06:34.229 
up one leg and down the other so it only

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:36.140 
up one leg and down the other so it only
measures<00:06:34.529> lower<00:06:34.889> body<00:06:35.130> fat<00:06:35.310> it<00:06:35.550> takes<00:06:35.760> does

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150 
measures lower body fat it takes does

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.969 
measures lower body fat it takes does
not<00:06:36.330> take<00:06:36.599> the<00:06:36.750> upper<00:06:36.990> body<00:06:37.139> fat<00:06:37.409> into<00:06:37.680> account

00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 
not take the upper body fat into account

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:39.690 
not take the upper body fat into account
here's<00:06:38.700> why<00:06:38.820> that<00:06:38.849> might<00:06:39.150> be<00:06:39.180> a<00:06:39.300> prop

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
here's why that might be a prop

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.970 
here's why that might be a prop
for<00:06:40.480> women<00:06:40.750> in<00:06:40.840> particular<00:06:40.960> who<00:06:41.500> store<00:06:41.830> their

how much body fat you have same thing
with<00:06:47.590> those<00:06:47.650> body<00:06:47.950> fat<00:06:48.190> tools<00:06:49.150> that<00:06:49.420> you<00:06:49.600> that

with those body fat tools that you that
are<00:06:50.230> hand<00:06:50.410> held<00:06:50.620> they're<00:06:51.190> only<00:06:51.340> telling<00:06:51.610> you

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:55.540 
belly fat or lower body fat so that's

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.330 
belly fat or lower body fat so that's

why it may be a problem that's why I

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:58.820 
why it may be a problem that's why I

anyway<00:07:08.920> this<00:07:09.490> very<00:07:09.910> low-tech<00:07:10.180> approach<00:07:10.600> is

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:11.080 
anyway this very low-tech approach is

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.660 
anyway this very low-tech approach is
probably<00:07:11.380> the<00:07:11.590> most<00:07:11.770> accurate<00:07:12.040> way<00:07:12.640> to

probably the most accurate way to

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:14.460 
probably the most accurate way to
measure<00:07:12.910> body<00:07:13.090> fat<00:07:13.240> and<00:07:13.630> I'm<00:07:14.110> actually<00:07:14.260> going
