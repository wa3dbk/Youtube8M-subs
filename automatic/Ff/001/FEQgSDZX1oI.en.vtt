00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.480
 hello I 'm simon your muscle maker 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.519
 today again something to the topic of yesterday 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.160
 to the video of yesterday 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.320
 Yesterday I said something about the 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.420
 strange combination of one 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.350
 low body fat percentage and much 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.779
 muscle mass 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.460
 So I'm very dry fat-free 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.029
 muscle mass but just a very massive 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.920
 with muscle mass a very impressive 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:31.080
 big muscle mass simply fat-free 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.540
 is where I told you that one 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.930
 thing is biologically seen and 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.149
 possible without it 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.489
 manipulate and form any in 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.800
 Whatever and now it works 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.140
 Of course I'm getting round now 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.539
 Emails here mean you mean you mean 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.210
 it may be that you are on the 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.370
 refers to other youtuber I refer 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.500
 I'll tell you frankly and honestly 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.600
 I do not care about anyone 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.969
 other youtuber based but simply 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.190
 only I try my opinion too 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.899
 explain how to build muscles 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.000
 just for this very small 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:09.360
 body fat percentage and to a very high 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.670
 muscle mass if that's just somewhere 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.450
 meets in the form of a human 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.560
 appearance 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.200
 that is often a matter he the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.610
 did not come off as normal 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.320
 said I have no one with it 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.479
 explicitly meant I want to want too 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.340
 not somehow you somehow to it 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.200
 direct that you think that must now 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.820
 they are about whom he speaks no quite 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.079
 open and honest of me I have then 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.060
 with no one thought and i have 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.500
 no ball at all about somebody 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.759
 to speak to others and how 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.509
 subliminal to looping too 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.040
 accuse 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.200
 my channel is always about me 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.509
 to my views around my tips and 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.799
 my experiences and my know-how and 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.000
 Accordingly, it will be in the next 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.380
 to go on time that means I will 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.420
 It does not guarantee me somehow 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.040
 Somebody's getting involved with that somehow 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.810
 to accuse others of looping 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.490
 I do not know I can not say 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.869
 who does not rave if I can just 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.659
 just talking about me can tell you 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.399
 i was 100 percent doping free it was 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.770
 always and always will that be that 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.479
 only thing I really clear and you 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.920
 I can promise you something 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.079
 open and honest 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.670
 I think that many others on each 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.520
 fall natural are on the move and that is 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.890
 quite a few really give the natural 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.810
 reach the dose grand and 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.060
 achieved 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.220
 but as I said in my statement of 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.020
 yesterday at a yes at a statement 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.850
 from yesterday I have no one in the 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.890
 in the background and not 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.720
 somehow several others again 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.050
 partly written under the videos 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.910
 has been 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.100
 that's just not true no one has 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.170
 explicitly thought and I do not want to 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.300
 like you somehow have that you 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.890
 thinks of any easy it 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.950
 It's just that you maybe 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:41.840
 my conception maybe realistic 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.610
 also get a subjective view of the things 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.230
 as if that's just possible 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.350
 low body fat a very 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.250
 build up big muscle mass 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.780
 so you maybe that short again 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.790
 clarifies what gets there yesterday 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.560
 meant even now in the form of 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.150
 living examples are simple 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.320
 can be assigned without being there 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.420
 now somehow in a vacuum 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.140
 what is speculating here again 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.960
 will stoke 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:05.720
 I take an example for example 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:08.420
 erika swiss bees do you know that 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.860
 is such a boxer but also martial 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.930
 arts continues to do so too 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.730
 different fighting cage fight and stuff 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.820
 further has since also kay one 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.780
 tried and so on and so forth 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.660
 is called a martial artist 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.520
 He is also known as the battery of 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.730
 is of a figure so that he is to 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.050
 for extremely has much mass sees 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.930
 just like another 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.750
 competitive athlete alexander lungu also a 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:35.180
 market martial arts fighter boxer too 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.100
 a martial arts all-rounder with one 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.200
 extremely muscle mass 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.250
 if you look at the two then 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.830
 you will notice that both are not as 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.360
 muscular in the first place but in 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.810
 first line perceived as bold 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.830
 become 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.360
 why are rx and alexander lungu as 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.820
 Bold perceived and not first 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.650
 line is solved even though it is mine 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:58.130
 in the first place must be resolved 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.080
 are 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:02.480
 because the performance you in sport 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.730
 bring conditional of the 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:08.300
 speed here and by force 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:11.060
 are unique features of power and 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:14.330
 clear from muscles 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.950
 both are just very muscular 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.140
 but also a correspondingly high 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.210
 very noticeable high body fat percentage 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.979
 even in the abdomen that's yes 

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:25.850
 right right when right 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.220
 overhang mandates we like political 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.560
 to express correctly so are already 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.260
 extremely thick bellies like the two have 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.930
 both Ericsson batteries and 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.630
 alexander lungu are right fischer 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.070
 whose right bulldozers have more 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.370
 of course, the corresponding books 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:45.080
 even if it may be because in the 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.490
 martial arts area at the level very much 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.620
 much good doping is used 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.000
 that both may have taken something 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.100
 I do not know that I would nobody 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.660
 assume but that is mine 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:55.760
 conception of the optics ago 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:57.740
 picture What a mass of these 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:59.240
 Extreme Muscle Mass Looks At You 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.490
 Just the neck to the 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.220
 shoulders start this the chest 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.870
 of these bulldozers what of one 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.160
 mass is possible here 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:13.490
 eric s batteries so and alexander 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.740
 lungu have the muscle mass of mine 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.330
 opinion for certain body types 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.490
 with a specific diet and one 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:22.010
 specific training is achievable 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:23.360
 Both have very high body fat percentage 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:25.700
 and it would not be possible this 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.240
 Muscle mass dry it means fat free 

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:30.770
 build up with a single digit 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.390
 Body fat percentage who can not do that 

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:35.210
 would not be possible, the muscle mass 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.919
 and just in the single digit 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.140
 body fat percentage area to come 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:41.270
 that is, if both lose weight 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.010
 because they also have it 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.330
 right aprons right in the abdomen area 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.220
 then of course they would also 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:49.160
 lose some of their mass and 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:50.330
 Although quite remarkable as to the now 

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:53.000
 based again very clear to say 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.440
 of these two very well-known figures 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.479
 at least in the martial arts area very much 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:58.760
 Well-known figures can be easily 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.680
 Let's say that's a muscle mass 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.050
 the reality is realistic too 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.789
 reaching humans is possible but is 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.190
 that then, of course, then too 

00:06:04.789 --> 00:06:08.570
 the body fat percentage is associated with whether 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.220
 it now for aesthetic reasons 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:11.990
 desirable it is a completely different one 

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.070
 I think it's so nice but if 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:16.580
 Now you have a counterexample 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:19.070
 maybe looking for someone who could 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.140
 you think something like sweet yes someone who 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.580
 just a very strong definition 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.810
 But that's not the case with the muscle packages 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:28.310
 I just think of it 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.349
 actually already doping convicted 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.940
 There are even photos and videos 

00:06:30.349 --> 00:06:33.500
 because something has squeezed, of course 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:34.790
 a very bad example 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.380
 of course, too 

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.600
 has used to be around 

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:40.610
 get body fat percentage down but 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.860
 otherwise I think that's a figure 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:43.520
 how sweet to get on nature's way away 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:45.740
 is 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:47.750
 It will be difficult, though 

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.250
 to say so and now thick 

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:51.020
 Pack muscle packages on it 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:53.570
 if that would be the one such 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:55.460
 approximate figure as sweet has naturalis 

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:57.470
 and says so now I want to 

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:59.510
 then he has to have thicker muscles too 

00:06:57.470 --> 00:07:01.220
 be ready for that too something 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:03.140
 higher body fat percentage in purchase too 

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:05.720
 take because it will hardly be possible 

00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.820
 on the basis of the low 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.400
 Body fat percentage continues muscle mass 

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:12.530
 build up without even giving in 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.070
 a small amount of body fat 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:15.080
 increase 

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:17.150
 These are just two counter examples 

00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.710
 once the two martial artists the 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.120
 just an extremely high muscle mass 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.010
 but also have a high 

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:24.260
 Body fat on the other side 

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:26.090
 otherwise type is simply wiry 

00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:27.530
 defined as athletic is the will 

00:07:26.090 --> 00:07:29.540
 just never really big 

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:30.950
 muscle packages on it can because because 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:33.320
 the body fat percentage also higher 

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.790
 climb I could think can the 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:36.620
 one or the other maybe ever so 

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:38.510
 to give a picture of reality 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:40.340
 I do not want anyone anywhere , as I said 

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:41.630
 of the doping accuse or attack 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.669
 or so we just say now 

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.229
 so my view of things 

00:07:43.669 --> 00:07:46.820
 describe and that was also what was 

00:07:45.229 --> 00:07:48.320
 very much interested in understanding it 

00:07:46.820 --> 00:07:49.580
 just as my opinion as mine 

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:50.990
 conception should really be there 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.550
 No one attacked I feel finds 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.320
 also not nice if somehow each other 

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:55.700
 trying to make the arsonist 

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.229
 and among other videos written 

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.760
 aidoo becomes so doping 

00:07:57.229 --> 00:08:01.250
 that is not true 

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:02.720
 all right as far as longer again 

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:04.010
 videos, however, are only briefly 

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.090
 we look forward to the next many greetings 

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:07.090
 your 7th
