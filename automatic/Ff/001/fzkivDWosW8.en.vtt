00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:08.639
 Hello dear friends today we are 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.679
 talk to you about what kind of water we 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.089
 drink and how to measure and concentration 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.820
 impurities in the water that we 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.640
 we use and what device for this 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.369
 need means in front of you on the photo 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.390
 a portable tds meter is shown 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.820
 or salary meter tds this device is intended 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:33.829
 to measure the total number of particles then 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:37.079
 there is water hardness dissolved in water 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:39.600
 apply it for what firstly how well 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.170
 where not good level control is needed 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.829
 salt and mineral hardness measurement 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.780
 electrical conductivity as well 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.510
 performance performance 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.000
 work cleaning filter off i.e. 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.840
 in other words, we need this device 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.930
 in order to measure concentration to 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.899
 filter your which you have and 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.850
 clean the tap water and after that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.860
 there is if the value before and after will 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:10.170
 equal then this filter is not 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:15.210
 the device works we have it means it 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.939
 He has such a beautiful cover three buttons 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.400
 on off 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:22.259
 temperature and hold key that is 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.140
 fixations measured fixed 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.729
 We looked at how to open its value. 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.500
 this cap here are two 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.570
 electrode two electrodes immersed in water 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.979
 and measure the dependence on what we 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:36.720
 want temperature or 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:41.790
 our rigidity 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:44.759
 our measured water what is measured 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.590
 we have with you here and stiffness stiffness 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.560
 measured in pi pi pi pi we 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.960
 denotes equal to 1 milligram per liter then 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.619
 there are how many impurities do we have in 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.350
 milligrams per liter of solution 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.100
 here it is shown here 73 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.610
 milligram is located 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.799
 in our liter here is such here just 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.100
 show that 00 nothing we measure here 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:13.760
 mean what i do i took water from under 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:17.270
 own filter in which there are 3 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.330
 cleaning step here shows that 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:23.120
 I have some water that I drink 110 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:26.180
 now they mean 100 or 110 milligrams 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:28.010
 per liter but what kind of water to filter it 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.319
 there is this filter and practically with us 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.800
 doesn't work i mean he needs 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.230
 replacing 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.069
 that's about what we have with you 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.940
 conversation 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.790
 that we can't know how we filter 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.280
 contaminated physically clear what if 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:45.410
 water is no longer coming from the tap and the filter is already 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.920
 clogged then it needs to be replaced as if 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.410
 extremely a . but what if the filter is well 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.299
 change early he did not use it too 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.519
 the question is if your friends 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:57.670
 They say about my water is super clean 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:03:00.950
 take the meter to measure and 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.549
 salt concentration before and after the filter 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:07.610
 filter and you will understand that this water 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:10.760
 went through a good cleaning and did not go here 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.519
 it means I run water from under the tap 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.609
 which is an impurity of 112 miles grams 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.549
 On liter principle this such can be said 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:21.739
 not even bad water bottled water 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.530
 I didnâ€™t measure her 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.079
 My colleagues say that there are 25 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.290
 milligram per liter that is 5 times 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.239
 smaller than us and from the tap 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.620
 distilled if normal 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.239
 distilled water she does not hold 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.130
 electrical current hence here 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:43.459
 must be tac toe that's what it means 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.579
 it is shown how we removed this cap 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:49.430
 the device is ready to work here with us 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:53.660
 changing temperature wanna is measured in 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:56.150
 Fahrenheit here we measure in Celsius in 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.500
 the device is inserted two batteries 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:02.840
 half a volt at any watch shop 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:06.920
 in any hour watch workshop you 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.829
 these batteries will supply 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.449
 my concentration in the well water 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:13.489
 water from a neighbor 

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:14.420
 he also always said my water tastes better 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.269
 what is yours but 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.600
 here we are convinced that he 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.030
 284 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.389
 milligrams per liter that is almost two with 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.100
 over times more than at home from the tap 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:27.889
 tap water contains impurities 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:31.550
 that is, the water principle is hard 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:34.370
 here's my waters taken from the well sucks 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:39.110
 more then 200 milligrams per liter 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:40.550
 I find impurities 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:42.980
 the device is good 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.750
 if someone is interested 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:50.600
 inexpensive write contact me to you 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.389
 I'll tell you where to get it thanks for 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.190
 attention to new meetings 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:59.020
 subscribe to my channel will be new 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:59.020
 videos bye
