00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
same from this year squad I think you

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.980 
same from this year squad I think you
know<00:00:17.640> we<00:00:17.820> won't<00:00:18.029> be<00:00:18.150> first<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.600> defense

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
know we won't be first in defense

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.720 
know we won't be first in defense
because<00:00:19.380> that's<00:00:19.590> where<00:00:19.800> we<00:00:19.980> were<00:00:20.250> used<00:00:20.580> to

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
because that's where we were used to

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.230 
because that's where we were used to
being<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.810> previous<00:00:22.289> years<00:00:22.560> but<00:00:22.970> at<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
being the the previous years but at the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.900 
being the the previous years but at the
same<00:00:24.480> time<00:00:24.840> I<00:00:25.170> think<00:00:26.010> our<00:00:26.609> team<00:00:26.849> really

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
same time I think our team really

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.330 
same time I think our team really
believes<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.930> that<00:00:28.230> style<00:00:28.619> and

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
believes in that that style and

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.769 
believes in that that style and
understanding<00:00:30.090> that<00:00:30.240> if<00:00:30.359> we're<00:00:30.510> going<00:00:30.720> to

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
understanding that if we're going to

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.240 
understanding that if we're going to
have<00:00:30.900> a<00:00:30.960> chance<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.349> compete<00:00:31.800> against<00:00:32.189> the

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
have a chance to compete against the

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.459 
have a chance to compete against the
best<00:00:32.489> then<00:00:33.329> we're<00:00:33.930> going<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.140> have<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> play

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
best then we're going to have to play

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.370 
best then we're going to have to play
good<00:00:34.739> on<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.040> in<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.870> and<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.079> going<00:00:37.290> to

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
good on that in and and it's going to

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.020 
good on that in and and it's going to
give<00:00:37.530> us<00:00:37.559> some<00:00:37.860> opportunities<00:00:38.430> may<00:00:38.640> be<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.910> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
give us some opportunities may be on the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.990 
give us some opportunities may be on the
other<00:00:39.149> end<00:00:39.270> so<00:00:39.829> we're<00:00:40.829> going<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.160> continue<00:00:41.700> to

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
other end so we're going to continue to

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.760 
other end so we're going to continue to
work<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.510> it's<00:00:43.230> probably<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.649> little

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
work at it it's probably a little

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.200 
work at it it's probably a little
different<00:00:44.250> team<00:00:44.430> because<00:00:44.820> we're<00:00:44.969> going<00:00:45.059> to<00:00:45.120> be

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
different team because we're going to be

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.979 
different team because we're going to be
much<00:00:45.360> bigger<00:00:46.280> inside<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.700> may<00:00:48.270> not<00:00:48.300> look<00:00:48.750> as

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
much bigger inside and may not look as

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.590 
much bigger inside and may not look as
active<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.280> hope<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.760> it's<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.239> team<00:00:51.449> that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
active but I hope that it's a team that

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.689 
active but I hope that it's a team that
plays<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:52.079> as<00:00:52.230> hard<00:00:52.469> as<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:52.770> previous<00:00:53.280> for

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
plays just as hard as the previous for

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.630 
plays just as hard as the previous for
half<00:00:53.910> it's<00:00:54.360> all<00:00:54.480> about<00:00:54.510> defense<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.379> we<00:00:55.980> we

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
half it's all about defense in we we

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.729 
half it's all about defense in we we
want<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> play<00:00:57.210> defense<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.870> feel<00:00:58.079> like<00:00:58.199> if<00:00:58.680> we

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
want to play defense we feel like if we

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.700 
want to play defense we feel like if we
