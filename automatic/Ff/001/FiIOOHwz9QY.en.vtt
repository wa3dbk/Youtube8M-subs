00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.090
 what kind of car does a person need? 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.180
 to move from point a to point b 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:12.160
 Need luxury speed or better 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.540
 driving experience about this 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.540
 we could philosophize a lot 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.210
 we are in the town of bilin game 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.400
 this in German means something like 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.259
 cheap home and here they know a lot about 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.509
 save if you want to drive a car 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:30.450
 new and you do not want to spend a lot of money 

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:32.550
 your car is this dacia sandero a car 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.680
 of nine thousand two hundred euros in the 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.860
 same level moves his Japanese rival the 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.110
 mitsubishi space stars the question is 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.300
 these cars can be fun 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.920
 basic or only fulfill the function of 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.920
 take you from point a to point b 

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.130
 discount let's take a look at the sandero 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.250
 He wears a profuse frontal on plastics 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.730
 that seems to say if I'm cheap and that in 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:59.770
 the trunk found between 320 and 1200 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.630
 liters this model looks more current than 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:04.110
 the rest of Dacia but keeps 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.630
 invariably a really attractive price 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.580
 inside it is simple to find 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.530
 a lot of hard plastic but you have to say 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.479
 that is not so bad in is a pure car 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.400
 where simplicity prevails does not take 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.680
 radios or air conditioning but to this 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.970
 car you do not need at least you 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.310
 they leave the gap to install a system 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.440
 old autistic audio make time 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.509
 we get on the road with the sandero 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.119
 which is based on the clio let's see the 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:30.970
 technical data thousand 149 centimeters 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.820
 Cubic capacity 75 horsepower 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:36.250
 power reaches 162 kilometers per 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.290
 hour and the average consumption is 6.3 liters 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.880
 to accelerate up to 100 kilometers 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:45.380
 hour takes 13 to 6 seconds 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.700
 and the consumption has seemed a little high 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.469
 offers enough power but it is 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.450
 too noisy inside for 

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:53.909
 highway I recommend that you install the 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.350
 radio and set it high to more than 120 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.700
 kilometers per hour the engine noise 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.900
 can be annoying scanned 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.050
 it's time to get on the mitsubishi 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.550
 space stars is 36 centimeters shorter 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.250
 that the dacian and is proud 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.900
 on his 14- inch wheels the 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.670
 outer appearance is something more careful 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.640
 but few luxuries we found in his 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.520
 interior in the trunk enter between 235 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.350
 and 912 liters this is still going to go 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.940
 conditioning and sound system so 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.950
 that in this aspect is better than 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.630
 sandero the three cylinders is just something 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:30.290
 slower and the soundproofing is something 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.170
 better has 71 horses reaches 172 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.080
 kilometers per hour and average consumption 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.730
 it stays at 47 liters the price part 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.300
 from nine thousand six hundred euros 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.090
 I was 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.970
 if I did not like his imprecise change 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.470
 manual the suspension is too dry and 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.090
 it's a shame because this car has 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.099
 good attributes 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.379
 seven pints of her who will win this 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.629
 comparative of adjusted prices none 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:59.180
 of the two has had easy mobility 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.280
 for small purses but it deserves 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.940
 worth spending so little let's put on 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.610
 situation 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.650
 my favorite car is the audi r8 v10 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:10.269
 well for the price of one could you 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.269
 buy you 25 of these 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:16.080
 and sincerely none of these 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.240
 cars transmits that feeling of what 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.550
 I want to have at all costs but from 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.710
 then they offer enough space are 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:24.450
 practical and they take you where you want 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:26.250
 but of course there has to be a 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.090
 winner and in this comparison is the 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.090
 dacia sandero view 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.660
 it's noisy but its suspension filters 

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:38.910
 better and especially not saved in 

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.350
 security as much as the mitsubishi in the 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.990
 brake test the Japanese has 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.090
 needed 2.5 meters more to stop 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.920
 from 100 kilometers per hour and in 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.110
 security issues especially in 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.610
 small cars we did not pass one 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.610
 that our winner is dacia sandero
