hi welcome simple scuba this is the

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.589 
hi welcome simple scuba this is the
scoop<00:00:06.240> remark<00:00:06.750> 21<00:00:07.230> G<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.710> 60<00:00:08.099> regulator<00:00:08.570> it's<00:00:09.570> a

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
scoop remark 21 G to 60 regulator it's a

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.320 
scoop remark 21 G to 60 regulator it's a
new<00:00:09.750> design<00:00:09.929> piston<00:00:10.880> fully<00:00:11.880> balanced

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
new design piston fully balanced

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.320 
new design piston fully balanced
regulator<00:00:13.400> obviously<00:00:14.400> based<00:00:14.610> around<00:00:14.969> to<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
regulator obviously based around to the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.689 
regulator obviously based around to the
Mach<00:00:15.509> 25<00:00:15.960> first<00:00:16.350> ages<00:00:16.800> are<00:00:17.130> really<00:00:17.460> really

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
Mach 25 first ages are really really

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.849 
Mach 25 first ages are really really
high<00:00:17.850> performing<00:00:18.420> first<00:00:18.810> stage<00:00:19.140> using<00:00:19.680> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
high performing first stage using the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.460 
high performing first stage using the
balanced<00:00:20.609> piston<00:00:21.029> design<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.140> scoop<00:00:22.350> row

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
balanced piston design so the scoop row

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.029 
balanced piston design so the scoop row
basically<00:00:22.949> made<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> slightly<00:00:23.640> more<00:00:24.180> compact

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
basically made a slightly more compact

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.740 
basically made a slightly more compact
shorter<00:00:26.039> version<00:00:26.849> of<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.090> still<00:00:27.480> very

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
shorter version of that still very

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.779 
shorter version of that still very
high-performing<00:00:28.470> obviously<00:00:29.369> still<00:00:29.550> cold

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
high-performing obviously still cold

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.549 
high-performing obviously still cold
water<00:00:29.939> rated<00:00:30.420> using<00:00:31.140> in<00:00:31.430> 250<00:00:32.430> rating<00:00:33.110> but<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.350> a

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
water rated using in 250 rating but is a

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.080 
water rated using in 250 rating but is a
lot<00:00:34.860> shorter<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.579> gives<00:00:35.790> it<00:00:35.820> a<00:00:35.910> much<00:00:36.059> more

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
lot shorter so it gives it a much more

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.470 
lot shorter so it gives it a much more
compact<00:00:36.630> much<00:00:37.320> more<00:00:37.559> convenient<00:00:38.300> type<00:00:39.300> of

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
compact much more convenient type of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.979 
compact much more convenient type of
system<00:00:40.969> has<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> lot<00:00:42.239> of<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.420> same<00:00:42.570> features

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
system has a lot of the same features

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.200 
system has a lot of the same features
obviously<00:00:43.800> it's<00:00:43.920> still<00:00:44.010> cold<00:00:44.520> water<00:00:44.730> rated

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
obviously it's still cold water rated

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.190 
obviously it's still cold water rated
has<00:00:45.989> all<00:00:46.170> the<00:00:46.440> cooling<00:00:47.280> fins<00:00:47.600> for<00:00:48.600> dissipating

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
has all the cooling fins for dissipating

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.380 
has all the cooling fins for dissipating
the<00:00:49.350> cold<00:00:49.649> it's<00:00:50.070> generated<00:00:50.730> for<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.000> press

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the cold it's generated for the press

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.910 
the cold it's generated for the press
guess<00:00:51.680> it<00:00:52.680> is<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:53.160> fixed<00:00:53.699> port<00:00:54.649> design<00:00:55.649> though

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
guess it is a fixed port design though

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.060 
guess it is a fixed port design though
so<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.340> has<00:00:56.460> for<00:00:56.969> low<00:00:57.539> pressure<00:00:57.750> ports<00:00:58.559> fixed

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
so it has for low pressure ports fixed

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.459 
so it has for low pressure ports fixed
at<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.370> top<00:00:59.550> so<00:00:59.760> like<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.210> 20<00:01:00.480> mark<00:01:00.570> 25<00:01:01.020> which

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
at the top so like the 20 mark 25 which

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.470 
at the top so like the 20 mark 25 which
has<00:01:01.649> a<00:01:01.680> swiveling<00:01:02.129> turret<00:01:02.430> these<00:01:02.910> are<00:01:03.210> fixed

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
has a swiveling turret these are fixed

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.960 
has a swiveling turret these are fixed
at<00:01:03.690> these<00:01:03.870> set<00:01:04.110> angles

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
at these set angles

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.240 
at these set angles
it<00:01:05.970> still<00:01:06.180> has<00:01:06.360> two<00:01:06.810> high-pressure<00:01:07.680> ports<00:01:08.100> one

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
it still has two high-pressure ports one

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.859 
it still has two high-pressure ports one
either<00:01:08.400> sides<00:01:08.670> obviously<00:01:08.880> convenient<00:01:09.720> hose

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
either sides obviously convenient hose

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.179 
either sides obviously convenient hose
routing<00:01:10.380> for<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:12.320> pressure<00:01:13.320> gauge<00:01:13.590> or<00:01:13.920> a

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
routing for a pressure gauge or a

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.950 
routing for a pressure gauge or a
wireless<00:01:14.580> transmission<00:01:15.240> as<00:01:15.360> well<00:01:15.390> in<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.840> if

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
wireless transmission as well in it if

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.310 
wireless transmission as well in it if
you<00:01:16.049> have<00:01:16.200> one<00:01:17.000> it<00:01:18.000> doesn't<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.900> High

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
you have one it doesn't have the High

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.469 
you have one it doesn't have the High
Flow<00:01:19.350> port<00:01:19.950> out<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.280> top<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.670> my<00:01:20.850> 25<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.420> it

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
Flow port out the top like my 25 so it

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.289 
Flow port out the top like my 25 so it
just<00:01:21.720> has<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.170> set<00:01:22.680> for<00:01:23.100> low<00:01:23.820> pressure<00:01:23.970> ports

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
just has a set for low pressure ports

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.710 
just has a set for low pressure ports
going<00:01:24.509> outside<00:01:25.820> still<00:01:26.820> available<00:01:27.270> in<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:27.540> din

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
going outside still available in the din

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.609 
going outside still available in the din
300<00:01:28.140> bar<00:01:28.320> as<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.950> can<00:01:29.310> see<00:01:29.460> here<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:30.439> also<00:01:31.439> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
300 bar as you can see here and also the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.569 
300 bar as you can see here and also the
230<00:01:32.189> put<00:01:32.549> our<00:01:32.759> eight<00:01:33.299> clamp<00:01:33.570> as<00:01:33.659> well<00:01:34.430> so<00:01:35.430> it's

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
230 put our eight clamp as well so it's

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.300 
230 put our eight clamp as well so it's
nice<00:01:35.729> compact<00:01:36.119> size<00:01:36.530> much<00:01:37.530> shorter<00:01:38.040> than<00:01:38.070> the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
nice compact size much shorter than the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.039 
nice compact size much shorter than the
Mach<00:01:38.520> 25<00:01:38.939> just<00:01:39.360> makes<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.720> little<00:01:39.780> bit<00:01:39.930> more

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
Mach 25 just makes it a little bit more

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.140 
Mach 25 just makes it a little bit more
convenient<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.650> traveling<00:01:41.009> with<00:01:41.070> or<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:42.030> you

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
convenient for traveling with or if you

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.039 
convenient for traveling with or if you
just<00:01:42.299> want<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> slightly<00:01:42.840> smaller

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
just want the slightly smaller

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.020 
just want the slightly smaller
configuration<00:01:45.979> supplied<00:01:46.979> with<00:01:47.220> rubber<00:01:47.820> hose

as standards coast protector on each end

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.999 
as standards coast protector on each end
just<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.390> get<00:01:51.540> a<00:01:51.570> bit<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.840> protection<00:01:52.470> at<00:01:52.979> the

again is a fully balanced
second<00:01:59.700> stage<00:01:59.909> so<00:02:00.390> really<00:02:00.689> high<00:02:00.810> performance

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
second stage so really high performance

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.039 
second stage so really high performance
consistent<00:02:02.880> performance<00:02:03.299> regards<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.810> depth

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
consistent performance regards the depth

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.109 
consistent performance regards the depth
or<00:02:04.200> sender<00:02:04.680> pressure<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.040> well<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.880> you've<00:02:06.030> got

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
or sender pressure as well so you've got

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.469 
or sender pressure as well so you've got
good<00:02:06.360> consistent<00:02:06.990> performance<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:08.209> bit<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.420> a

breathe most of a seer detuning it if

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.830 
breathe most of a seer detuning it if
you<00:03:08.040> need<00:03:08.220> to<00:03:08.340> underwater<00:03:08.760> obviously<00:03:09.329> under

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
you need to underwater obviously under

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.360 
you need to underwater obviously under
normal<00:03:10.019> circumstances<00:03:10.890> you<00:03:10.980> can<00:03:11.099> have<00:03:11.250> it

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
normal circumstances you can have it

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.100 
normal circumstances you can have it
round<00:03:11.610> all<00:03:11.819> the<00:03:11.849> way<00:03:11.970> out<00:03:12.209> to<00:03:12.750> opt<00:03:12.930> and

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
round all the way out to opt and

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.280 
round all the way out to opt and
performance<00:03:14.000> also<00:03:15.000> have<00:03:15.269> bench<00:03:15.569> area<00:03:15.810> control

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
performance also have bench area control

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.550 
performance also have bench area control
so<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.280> can<00:03:17.489> switch<00:03:18.359> between<00:03:18.569> a<00:03:18.989> dive<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.500> a

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
so you can switch between a dive and a

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.680 
so you can switch between a dive and a
pre<00:03:19.769> dive<00:03:19.950> mode<00:03:20.250> as<00:03:20.489> basically<00:03:21.239> controlling

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
pre dive mode as basically controlling

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.660 
pre dive mode as basically controlling
that<00:03:21.989> how<00:03:22.319> the<00:03:22.380> air<00:03:22.620> flow<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.190> inside<00:03:23.519> the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
that how the air flow is inside the

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.940 
that how the air flow is inside the
second<00:03:24.000> stage<00:03:24.180> so<00:03:24.389> in<00:03:24.480> pre<00:03:24.690> dive<00:03:24.870> more<00:03:25.440> air<00:03:25.739> is

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
second stage so in pre dive more air is

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:28.160 
second stage so in pre dive more air is
directed<00:03:26.220> towards<00:03:26.760> the<00:03:26.819> front<00:03:27.060> of<00:03:27.299> the<00:03:27.690> second

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
directed towards the front of the second

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.750 
directed towards the front of the second
stage<00:03:28.319> where<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.769> diaphragm<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.370> helping

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
stage where the diaphragm is helping

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.059 
stage where the diaphragm is helping
push<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.239> back<00:03:30.389> out<00:03:30.620> obviously<00:03:31.620> when<00:03:31.950> you're

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:32.069 
push it back out obviously when you're

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:33.740 
push it back out obviously when you're
using<00:03:32.280> it<00:03:32.489> you'll<00:03:32.849> want<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.120> in<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.299> dive<00:03:33.480> mode

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:33.750 
using it you'll want it in the dive mode

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.500 
using it you'll want it in the dive mode
and<00:03:34.380> that's<00:03:34.530> allowing<00:03:34.829> air<00:03:35.130> directly<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:36.450> the

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
and that's allowing air directly to the

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.610 
and that's allowing air directly to the
mouthpiece<00:03:36.690> are<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:37.290> getting<00:03:37.470> the<00:03:37.530> best

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
mouthpiece are you getting the best

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.960 
mouthpiece are you getting the best
float<00:03:39.290> mouthpiece<00:03:40.290> itself<00:03:40.680> has<00:03:41.459> a<00:03:41.489> slightly
