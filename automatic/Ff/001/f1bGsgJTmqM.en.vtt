this mushroom every time there should

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.080 
this mushroom every time there should
never<00:02:02.190> there<00:02:03.190> could<00:02:03.400> never<00:02:03.490> be<00:02:03.640> any<00:02:03.880> doubt

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
never there could never be any doubt

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.570 
never there could never be any doubt
about<00:02:04.150> whether<00:02:04.540> you<00:02:04.750> make<00:02:04.930> it<00:02:08.250> so<00:02:09.250> this<00:02:09.399> is

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
about whether you make it so this is

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.730 
about whether you make it so this is
just<00:02:09.700> one<00:02:09.970> way<00:02:10.000> to<00:02:10.210> do<00:02:10.509> it<00:02:10.660> other<00:02:11.200> people<00:02:11.590> have

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
just one way to do it other people have

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.580 
just one way to do it other people have
different<00:02:12.160> ways<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:12.930> once<00:02:13.930> again<00:02:14.110> three

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
different ways so once again three

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.780 
different ways so once again three
triple<00:02:15.010> jumps<00:02:15.370> a<00:02:15.840> dive<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.400> now<00:02:18.400> let's<00:02:18.670> see

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
triple jumps a dive and now let's see

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.950 
triple jumps a dive and now let's see
you<00:02:18.910> end<00:02:19.060> up<00:02:19.210> here<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:20.530> get<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.800> camera<00:02:21.190> here

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
you end up here you get the camera here

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.800 
you end up here you get the camera here
get<00:02:22.960> Mario<00:02:23.410> right<00:02:23.710> behind<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.100> box<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:25.720> you

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
get Mario right behind the box see you

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.420 
get Mario right behind the box see you
left<00:02:25.990> twice<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:28.600> now<00:02:29.110> I<00:02:29.170> hit<00:02:29.470> be<00:02:29.709> I'm<00:02:30.070> pulling

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
left twice and now I hit be I'm pulling

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.330 
left twice and now I hit be I'm pulling
the<00:02:30.459> left<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.990> right<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.800> can<00:02:35.950> even<00:02:36.070> watch

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
the left and right you can even watch

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.430 
the left and right you can even watch
the<00:02:36.580> shadow<00:02:36.760> of<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.060> box<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:39.959> it<00:02:40.959> takes<00:02:41.350> a

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
the shadow of the box and it takes a

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.930 
the shadow of the box and it takes a
little<00:02:41.560> practice<00:02:41.830> but<00:02:42.100> you<00:02:42.370> can<00:02:42.490> hold<00:02:42.700> right

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
little practice but you can hold right

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.150 
little practice but you can hold right
in<00:02:43.120> such<00:02:43.330> a<00:02:43.360> way<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:43.660> like<00:02:44.410> your<00:02:44.590> momentum<00:02:45.040> is

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
in such a way that like your momentum is

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.310 
in such a way that like your momentum is
carrying<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.700> a<00:02:45.730> little<00:02:46.120> bit<00:02:46.239> further<00:02:46.450> so

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
carrying you a little bit further so

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.650 
carrying you a little bit further so
you're<00:02:47.530> hitting<00:02:47.830> if<00:02:48.130> you<00:02:49.000> hit<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.180> too<00:02:49.420> soon

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.660 
you're hitting if you hit it too soon

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.940 
you're hitting if you hit it too soon
you're<00:02:49.959> just<00:02:50.110> going<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.350> go<00:02:50.440> off<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.620> edge<00:02:52.950> but

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
you're just going to go off the edge but

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.110 
you're just going to go off the edge but
that's<00:02:54.130> really<00:02:54.280> all<00:02:54.430> there<00:02:54.580> is<00:02:54.760> to<00:02:54.940> say<00:02:55.090> about

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
that's really all there is to say about

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.170 
that's really all there is to say about
the<00:02:55.420> box<00:02:55.600> gym<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:59.459> guess<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.610> could<00:03:00.760> say<00:03:00.940> how<00:03:01.030> much

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
the box gym I guess I could say how much

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.940 
the box gym I guess I could say how much
time<00:03:01.510> it<00:03:01.660> saves<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.230> only<00:03:02.440> other<00:03:02.560> way<00:03:02.769> to<00:03:02.800> get

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
time it saves the only other way to get

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.490 
time it saves the only other way to get
that<00:03:03.130> cigar<00:03:03.459> really<00:03:03.910> on<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.600> fast<00:03:04.900> is<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.290> log

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
that cigar really on the fast is the log

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.009 
that cigar really on the fast is the log
jam<00:03:05.730> just<00:03:06.730> a<00:03:06.940> lot<00:03:07.090> long<00:03:07.420> jump<00:03:07.720> off<00:03:07.870> the<00:03:08.050> log<00:03:10.019> but

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
jam just a lot long jump off the log but

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.020 
jam just a lot long jump off the log but
the<00:03:11.200> Box<00:03:11.440> jump<00:03:11.650> is<00:03:11.860> about<00:03:12.130> five<00:03:12.730> or<00:03:12.910> six

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
the Box jump is about five or six

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.270 
the Box jump is about five or six
seconds<00:03:13.480> faster<00:03:13.930> so<00:03:14.320> you<00:03:14.350> can<00:03:14.769> use<00:03:15.070> that<00:03:15.220> to

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
seconds faster so you can use that to

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.680 
seconds faster so you can use that to
decide<00:03:15.820> whether<00:03:17.820> which<00:03:18.820> one<00:03:19.120> of<00:03:19.150> the<00:03:19.330> two<00:03:19.360> to

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
decide whether which one of the two to

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:22.580 
decide whether which one of the two to
do<00:03:19.870> like<00:03:20.260> how<00:03:20.440> you<00:03:20.500> how<00:03:20.830> risky<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.370> want<00:03:21.580> to<00:03:21.730> be

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
do like how you how risky you want to be

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.070 
do like how you how risky you want to be
so<00:03:23.590> that's<00:03:23.769> it<00:03:23.950> for<00:03:24.130> this<00:03:24.220> tutorial<00:03:25.049> see<00:03:26.049> you

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
so that's it for this tutorial see you

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.380
