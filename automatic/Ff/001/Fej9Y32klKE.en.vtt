00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
good streaks going on but you'll see

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.880 
good streaks going on but you'll see
I'll<00:02:49.920> have<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.340> m<00:02:50.550> 98<00:02:50.760> be<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:52.380> you'll<00:02:52.560> see<00:02:52.769> I'm

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
I'll have the m 98 be so you'll see I'm

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.020 
because it's a little more reliable if
you<00:03:00.810> can<00:03:00.959> get<00:03:01.110> someone<00:03:01.320> in<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.530> face<00:03:01.970> you<00:03:02.970> just

so i don't know i don't really like the

much like to move around and I'm

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.770 
much like to move around and I'm
thinking<00:03:29.519> about<00:03:29.579> switching<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.180> scope<00:03:30.480> for

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
thinking about switching the scope for

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.720 
thinking about switching the scope for
when<00:03:30.900> I'm<00:03:30.989> doing<00:03:31.170> some<00:03:31.440> aggressive<00:03:31.920> recon<00:03:32.160> but
