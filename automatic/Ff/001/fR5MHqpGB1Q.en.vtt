everything that we did up front and all
the<00:00:23.519> engine<00:00:23.730> components<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.269> we<00:00:24.390> did<00:00:24.650> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
the engine components that we did and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.080 
the engine components that we did and
things<00:00:25.800> looking<00:00:26.039> really<00:00:26.369> good<00:00:26.490> nice<00:00:26.820> and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
things looking really good nice and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.540 
things looking really good nice and
there<00:00:27.710> anyways<00:00:28.710> we<00:00:28.920> were<00:00:29.010> able<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.220> mock<00:00:29.400> up

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
there anyways we were able to mock up

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.269 
there anyways we were able to mock up
the<00:00:29.670> springs<00:00:30.000> finally<00:00:30.859> we<00:00:31.859> use<00:00:32.009> the<00:00:32.130> original

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
the springs finally we use the original

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.860 
the springs finally we use the original
design<00:00:32.730> off<00:00:32.880> my<00:00:33.180> truck<00:00:33.420> when<00:00:33.540> I<00:00:33.600> did<00:00:33.750> my

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
design off my truck when I did my

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.530 
design off my truck when I did my
original<00:00:34.200> lift<00:00:34.730> we<00:00:35.730> just<00:00:35.880> hacked<00:00:36.090> everything

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
original lift we just hacked everything

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.630 
original lift we just hacked everything
up<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:36.899> boxed<00:00:37.380> everything<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.860> never<00:00:38.489> things

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
up and boxed everything in never things

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.889 
up and boxed everything in never things
just<00:00:38.820> kind<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> tacked<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.420> there<00:00:39.600> right<00:00:39.719> now

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
just kind of tacked on there right now

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.060 
just kind of tacked on there right now
until<00:00:40.710> we<00:00:40.860> fab<00:00:41.100> but<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.399> really<00:00:41.700> want<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:43.710> axle

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
until we fab but we really want the axle

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.330 
until we fab but we really want the axle
is<00:00:44.129> not<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.489> final<00:00:44.820> axle<00:00:45.180> just<00:00:45.629> kind<00:00:45.809> of<00:00:46.340> to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
is not the final axle just kind of to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.590 
is not the final axle just kind of to
mock<00:00:47.489> everything<00:00:47.640> up<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.239> see<00:00:48.360> where<00:00:48.480> our

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
mock everything up and see where our

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.330 
mock everything up and see where our
placements<00:00:49.050> going<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.289> be<00:00:49.410> it's<00:00:49.890> actually<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
placements going to be it's actually a

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.290 
placements going to be it's actually a
four<00:00:50.610> day<00:00:50.760> at<00:00:50.910> sixty<00:00:51.210> that's<00:00:51.360> been<00:00:51.510> clocked

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
four day at sixty that's been clocked

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.029 
four day at sixty that's been clocked
but<00:00:54.300> probably<00:00:55.050> won't<00:00:55.230> be<00:00:55.350> using<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.620> axle

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
but probably won't be using that axle

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.760 
but probably won't be using that axle
it's<00:00:56.160> all<00:00:56.280> kind<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:56.969> hack<00:00:57.120> job<00:00:57.620> from<00:00:58.620> another

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
it's all kind of a hack job from another

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.479 
it's all kind of a hack job from another
truck<00:00:59.039> I<00:00:59.160> had<00:01:00.680> yeah<00:01:01.680> it's<00:01:01.980> looking<00:01:02.190> really

made I stick solid really good I got the

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.960 
made I stick solid really good I got the
springs<00:01:19.560> from<00:01:19.650> carriage<00:01:20.070> Springs<00:01:20.460> here's<00:01:20.880> a

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
springs from carriage Springs here's a

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.730 
springs from carriage Springs here's a
website<00:01:21.390> right<00:01:21.540> here<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:22.350> actually<00:01:22.619> had<00:01:22.710> a

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
website right here they actually had a

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.170 
website right here they actually had a
Canada<00:01:23.189> cell<00:01:23.490> it's<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.700> only<00:01:23.790> place<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.119> could

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
Canada cell it's the only place I could

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.630 
Canada cell it's the only place I could
find<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.659> made<00:01:24.810> these<00:01:25.100> I'd<00:01:26.100> have<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.400> find

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
find that made these I'd have to find

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.460 
find that made these I'd have to find
out<00:01:26.790> something<00:01:27.090> with<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> rear<00:01:27.630> area<00:01:27.750> I'm

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
thinking maybe a so 20 inch 26 inch

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.920 
thinking maybe a so 20 inch 26 inch

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
experienced what you guys done biggest

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.700 
experienced what you guys done biggest
thing<00:01:54.570> right<00:01:54.720> now<00:01:54.750> is<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.080> getting<00:01:55.260> the<00:01:55.320> Axel

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
thing right now is just getting the Axel

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.590 
thing right now is just getting the Axel
and<00:01:56.660> mocking<00:01:57.660> everything<00:01:57.840> up<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:59.340> then<00:01:59.600> make

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
and mocking everything up and then make

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.000 
and mocking everything up and then make
sure<00:02:00.630> we<00:02:00.870> clock<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.230> transfer<00:02:01.560> case<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.950> the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:02.010 
sure we clock the transfer case in the

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.500 
sure we clock the transfer case in the
motor<00:02:02.190> I<00:02:02.520> mean<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.850> lot<00:02:02.970> of<00:02:03.060> work<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.300> be<00:02:03.390> done

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
motor I mean a lot of work to be done

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.420 
motor I mean a lot of work to be done
but<00:02:04.410> it's<00:02:04.560> getting<00:02:04.770> there<00:02:06.470> and<00:02:07.470> hopefully

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:08.430 
but it's getting there and hopefully

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.480 
but it's getting there and hopefully
we're<00:02:08.729> doing<00:02:08.760> it<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.030> right<00:02:09.149> way<00:02:10.370> so<00:02:11.370> we'll

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:11.490 
we're doing it the right way so we'll

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.970 
we're doing it the right way so we'll
