 deconstructed because they built 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.739
 because all the demands in class and we 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.899
 we think we know something 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.149
 respect of a theological subject has the 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.129

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.100

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.860
 I sat on the living room floor so that 's why 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.590

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.270
 You think you're a believer? 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.950
 Good, I'm making this video because 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.600
 The first time I like to make videos 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.610
 as I already said and because I also 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.700
 I like books so I'll talk about 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.770
 books that deconstruct us I intend 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.340
 I do not know if God wants and I have 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.659
 condition time and ideas and get an idea 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.890
 I intend to speak to do some 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.659
 comments from some books that I 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.400
 I've read or I'll start with the 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.420
 books that the staff that the teachers 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.450
 they sent us reads or they sent 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.900
 you mean it here they had it read 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.860
 or you have to read because they 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:46.290
 they set the team anyway we pick it up here 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:48.780
 He is from the bookstore sticks and actually a 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.790
 large collection of patristic books 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.500
 that our matter and I chose 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.930
 the pastoral theology of Gregory the Great 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.380

 the name and this book is very good because 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.100
 he give us if they build then you think 

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:07.300
 that if anything is going to be a book 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.160
 that of a guy that event and him who 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.890
 end up with you he calms down when you 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.830
 had ended up if we have a matter 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.980
 called neurotic m we have to 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.440
 reading this book understands what it says 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.170
 on hermeneutics in fact in terms 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.420
 What you read then does not know the wait 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.550
 lizards when felipe left the family 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.920
 is happening and he will meet in the 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.620
 and the year you are reading with isaiah and 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.780
 he runs the agent question you know and 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.510
 since you leda and spoke like ah like me 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:41.120
 I understood and half explains and finally from there 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:43.760
 he acts in history 89 think they 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:47.299
 nine follows so and this book he 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:49.220
 talks about the rise to hermeneutics 

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:52.069
 It 's good 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.650
 This book is very pop of the parents of 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:56.930
 Church cpi this book he tells me 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.630
 work because because each is the parents 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:02.209
 to the car seeking to launch on the basis of 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.609
 theology today we have this car to 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:06.440
 To read it, there was no one to not only 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.930
 arrest the apostles and they were 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.569
 persecuted, they had discussions with 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.760
 elect death because then it is very 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.819
 interesting you read a book of this they 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.920
 helped to provoke morumbi and xk as well 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.380
 this book here if you hope to leave 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.530
 The book of martyrs is a 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.819
 classic only tells things that happened 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:27.109
 with people who defended 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.660
 Christianity to the last 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:32.930
 consequences and pay a blood price 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.000
 so that's why it's here 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.709
 they died and their stories are 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.450
 described in this book these cases 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.940
 of those died because of the 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:43.329
 fidelidade criciÃºma word of god com 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.519
 the bible and people collide 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.560
 emotionally healthy spirituality 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.910
 to a book as soon as you've opened 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.910
 taking both by the done 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:02.690
 is that was not combined old panorama 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.400
 of the New Testament of the new life a 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:07.570
 very good story and it 's a book that speaks 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.700
 about culture talks about customs 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.430
 of the Greeks 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.080
 light of God makes a study and if 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:17.049
 positive about each new book 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.269
 testament is apocalypse of mateus until 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.660
 apocalypse with staff stay here I 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.000
 I hope you continue in this process. 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.130
 deconstruction because it is very 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.780
 important we are going to have to build 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.110
 it was a wrong dream for 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.330
 can be consumed in the right way and 

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.860
 I hope that you liked it at the 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.750
 I also laugh 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.060
 Although I did not like the footprint, it is 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.060
 This is where you lost ctx county
