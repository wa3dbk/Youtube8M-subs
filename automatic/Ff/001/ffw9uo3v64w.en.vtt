00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.759
 the lot is amoral wanted my family 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.880
 occupying aboard this ferry level the 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.840
 style said we take care of the cia 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:33.300
 going from belgium yves bagdad 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:36.340
 installments stadium director xts your 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.649
 suitcases noted the great together 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.480
 the letter f round pasteurization small 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:44.080
 need to be better standards at the 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:48.100
 Drag and bricks is monomur 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:54.130
 obvious that your 2 stun nicosia do not want 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:58.060
 still should the new 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:00.160
 complicated status 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.380
 I believe that our country for yet 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.239
 build something that becomes of 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.100
 more and more difficult I believe that here 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.280
 a your projects I think our team 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.100
 national proves that ultimately a lot 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.410
 many people are still very Belgian 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.970
 I believe that if we have the opportunity to 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:22.630
 participate in this project and that the study 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.130
 of profitability proves to us that by 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.930
 more b that it was a good thing for 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.760
 an electron would obviously be stupid to 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.760
 not to not go there 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:40.160
 he I believe the three words say 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.300
 that ultimately delectable is something 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.390
 something special 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.490
 I think we do a lot of jealous 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:48.440
 I think every year it's ten 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.380
 years that I live here and that every year 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.300
 we are we are or champions where the 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.730
 a few times when we were second that 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.550
 been very close to being champions where they 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.680
 make alex is a culture as well 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:04.190
 on the field off the field 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.040
 so it's a certain dignity it's 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:08.149
 always want to be the best and 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.450
 that's what we're going to try again 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:14.050
 during the thirty or the forty years 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.050
 who will follow
