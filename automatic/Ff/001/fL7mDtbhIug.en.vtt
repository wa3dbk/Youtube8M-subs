00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.900
 hello everyone here a welcome success 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.970
 I hope you have the shape we are 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.009
 found to feed play 3 stars 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.089
 hdv fast 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:23.529
 cauchon wife if you have not yet 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:26.349
 recognized we have two goals m in the camps 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:28.300
 level 2 we have a peak at level 4 years in 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.249
 the bell castle in attack we have 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.140
 some few wizard bags that go 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:35.440
 allow to clear and prepare the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.380
 passage for the king and pk four 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.030
 sappers to open the first wall at 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.800
 level of care we have a poison in 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.630
 Should a clan castle very 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.530
 weak in defense 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.780
 otherwise we keep for the skeletons 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.270
 during the attack the phase of laughing 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.550
 a healing spell that will serve to 

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:53.560
 banter to advance to the center of 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.030
 village and get rid of any clan 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:58.780
 if it's anything other than trouble 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.830
 very simple we have our king level 10 that 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.100
 it's for the first part of the tacc 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.960
 and then we have 18 pig level 4 with 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.399
 two healing spells for the second 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.659
 part 

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:09.579
 so how is the tacc going to unfold 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:11.710
 how does if alexis decide 

00:01:09.579 --> 00:01:14.649
 to attack this village a first golem 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.100
 here a second trip here wizards 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:19.810
 toulon the goal is to clean we will see 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.460
 that it's just right 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.479
 will have a little more apart but it 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.789
 it's a pretty general remark 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.259
 dismissed well you to the wizards behind 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:26.920
 your colleagues did not put them right 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.689
 behind them 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.479
 what I mean by that is that if 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:33.399
 you send a golem here a golem there 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.609
 what are the defenses that are going to be 

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.659
 attracted and well this market tower this 

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:40.810
 mortar 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.229
 this gun and seven rounds market all that this 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.209
 would that be typing your 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.749
 golem tell yourself that even if you ask a 

00:01:46.209 --> 00:01:50.770
 Wizard 

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:52.810
 here he is the target of people even this 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.810
 mortar 1 will also shoot at those 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.429
 gonnehem there so that means you 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.009
 can drop a wizard here 

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:02.619
 essential to a wizard health ciss 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.789
 you can even drop a wizard here 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:08.560
 one here and one there it makes you 6 he 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.159
 still remains 3 and there you can in 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.500
 put one in the middle by 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:16.540
 1 2 and you keep a cleaning point 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.610
 that's the way to clear it 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.000
 very very wide to be sure that when 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.170
 you put the pkk and the king that's all 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.090
 but very well played Alexis 1 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.230
 no problem but good if we go 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.159
 to be purist one could clear away a 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.159
 a little bit wider 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.709
 I love the use of two sappers 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:38.319
 as we remove the golems the sappers 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.569
 we send them here between the two goals m 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.099
 so no chance to take a shell of 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.989
 mortars for example on the head this is 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.849
 not possible you spread well golem and 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.769
 you put the sapper between the two 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.579
 played very well 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.900
 then once it's clear 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:54.310
 pose the king and the pkk 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.780
 everyone goes to the center we have a 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.269
 beautiful without rage that is put 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.370
 here to take care of the clan castle or 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.400
 there is a golem to a dragon and 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.170
 balloons I believe and continue to type 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.980
 in this wall to get into the 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:10.150
 village and in parallel once we 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.620
 arrive at the center once we arrive 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.129
 on this central area with our 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.560
 Kuwait 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:15.519
 we put the pigs so we could have 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.380
 do it in surgery call 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:19.480
 there is everything going on there alexis of 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.540
 choose to make a wave on the left 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.010
 from there and manage spells 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.139
 of care as the first care center 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.120
 here once these first defenses 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:31.030
 have fallen and a second center of 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.540
 care here and you will see that we are very 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.760
 large 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.099
 the archives are kept for cleaning at 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.049
 the end and we'll drop them to the side 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.500
 here archers to clean the 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.349
 buildings 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.000
 once the defenses have fallen and 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:44.560
 all that gives a three stars in 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.810
 two minutes so very well played with 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:49.359
 if they continue like that I do not 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.199
 do not wait any longer we start you 

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:57.010
 see below we will ask the two parts 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:58.209
 we laid the two goals m alas the 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.829
 sappers so to angels 

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.209
 it would have been better to clean up before 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.590
 ask the sappers not that your golem 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.970
 time for free because to splinters 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.859
 they are the target of more defenses 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.199
 than before but it's not a it's a 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:10.419
 detail the wizards are well posed 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.410
 but see the king almost went away 

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:12.970
 thankfully that this is one of 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.510
 fallen buildings that had been cleared a 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.160
 not wide 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.640
 the pkr directly inside 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:20.780
 and there everyone comes back we are we have 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.080
 posed the sense of rage for that 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.580
 the essential gets rid of the dragon and 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.170
 everyone benefits in the end all 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.790
 your or enjoying rage it's very 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.350
 well played we arrive at the center 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:32.840
 and this is the time to start the 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:35.720
 part of the tacc, namely the removal of 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.520
 pigs the famous vague line of 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.020
 pigs on the left we are patient on 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:41.090
 the blow and care out of it that it to ask 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.590
 now you have almost no 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:44.210
 pig falling because the defenses 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.520
 are on your left still in the center 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:49.190
 so very well played a professor of 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:51.680
 care that is very well laid a bomb 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.000
 falling meat that bursts but no 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:54.590
 problem she is simple so 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.600
 the health center corrects it 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.580
 second is triggered and so very well 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.440
 mastered the leyre the management of the 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:02.120
 doubling but very good it takes 

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:04.160
 always take a double bombs 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.390
 giant potential in the direction of his 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.070
 length is not the broad 

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:09.170
 if you want to trigger them after one 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.790
 the other the second body care spells 

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:11.930
 could be placed slightly to the right but 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.400
 it is to quibble because it is 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.530
 very well played and see that we are lost 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.000
 very little pig we still have the 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.590
 archers for the on the left for 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.140
 clean up a little faster 

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.880
 and that's the sense of poison that does not have 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.740
 been used and it's played well 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.240
 do not use on dragons and 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.860
 balloons is using nothing so much to keep 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.570
 if you ever have a lot of traps 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.419
 earthly ethics that goes off 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.500
 during your pig for removal 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.990
 as your pig progress in the village 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.460
 you use them at that time on the 

00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:38.660
 pigs and suddenly it will destroy the 

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.910
 skeletons that can be 

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:43.040
 problematic especially finally in attack 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.540
 so very well played alexis a pig web 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:45.770
 who works very well I avoided I you 

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:47.480
 advise to do this method 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.490
 most of the time you do two 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.440
 minimum stars with your goavec with 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.550
 your minigo hype and the pigs allows 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.530
 to do the third star 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:56.950
 it avoids failing to make heroes a 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.860
 star with perhaps more 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.570
 more crazy pig crowd and so that's 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.950
 very beautiful compo very beautiful execution 

00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:07.030
 bravo to Alexis and I find you 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.030
 very quickly for a next wounds
