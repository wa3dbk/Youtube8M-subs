00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.039
 hello and good we are in minecraft for 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.830
 watch the new video mode this mode will 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:20.279
 camping flame mod that would come 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.619
 the camping or camping motel does not 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.860
 as it is said well but good we are going to 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.029
 start with this poor the first 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.079
 tool that we have to create is 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.730
 this would be the tool 

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.820
 of the 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.340
 of the camper and is already craft with this 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.090
 get red six of these color 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.879
 pink 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.100
 I say red they are made with roses and 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.050
 three iron we have the first 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.300
 simply one this can be used 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.030
 several times with one I think it has 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.379
 up to one hundred use if I'm not wrong 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.610
 then we have the fires the first 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.290
 fire is this that is simply 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.379
 decorative is practiced in this way with 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.450
 three clint torches and stone the mass 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.790
 what better is it that it would have been 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.640
 what is called wood but good yes 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.409
 he did he did it with stones with stone 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.210
 well here we have it this does not work for 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.000
 nothing creative it as simply estero 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.369
 use as if it were a torch and already 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.440
 there's really no more after 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.960
 we have the multi cooking that would come 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.930
 being this one is craft and in this way 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.820
 with a normal fire and 4 hornitos 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.770
 then this what it does is that we can 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.170
 put up to six things to heat 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.530
 to heat to burn we are going to 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.530
 get us 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.240
 little bit of this 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.119
 we multiply this 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.440
 put this here and we can go heated 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:39.729
 we can put six things either of 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.890
 different community of the same as 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.140
 want to say because in the end after 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.909
 put a whole stack here, but you can not 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.190
 put different things for example here 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.740
 You can put one of this meat 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.440
 cow or whatever you want is slow but 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.690
 Well, you leave it there for a while and you go to 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.340
 do your things and then you come back and 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.860
 then we have this one that felt that 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.880
 it was being the fast one practiced with 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:06.630
 a camp yesterday and with clint is this modern 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.630
 more food and here 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.480
 we put this here in theory this is 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.130
 much faster as they see but this one just 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.780
 will create just going to warm up a 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.750
 thing I recommend better to do this is 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.150
 cheaper and is not cheaper because 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.440
 iron is heated but good 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.090
 too fast the food is a lot 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.709
 better and good this is all here we have 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.390
 the other that was the chip that 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.420
 it would be the cheap one so to speak 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.860
 secret with the ndr but yes a camper that 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.630
 if this one did not mark the I think this is more 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.270
 slow but you can capture two things to the 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:43.630
 time or something like that with kraft and heat two 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:45.640
 things like how I play with kraft and arabic 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.790
 that's how it can be heating up two things 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.790
 at the same time 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.090
 but it's too slow there's possibility 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.860
 that you multiply what you are 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.320
 burning and also possibilities that 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.760
 nothing appears or is destroyed and 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.330
 well let's go for the last one that would come 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.330
 being this 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:08.780
 I tried it or to see it 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:16.140
 I'm here 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:18.749
 be here be here and this team does not 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.499
 we have this that would come being urges 

00:03:18.749 --> 00:03:25.740
 cooking saying cooking so 

00:03:22.499 --> 00:03:27.990
 snapshot right now they will see 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.340
 and there it is already cooked this goes 

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:32.130
 great but good because you have to record 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.200
 all to be able to do this which 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.850
 It is also not so bad but hey this already 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.770
 It depends on everyone 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.180
 let's use the one that follows too 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.000
 we have marshmallows that would come 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.300
 the fuck what are these called the 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.240
 chocolates is carted with sugar an egg 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.910
 a bottle of water and a bowl the bowl 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.370
 it returns to you at the end and then you have it 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.060
 to put on a stick and here is this what 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.060
 how to use 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.380
 to this one if we do not eat it the stick does not 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.940
 He came back I can not eat it because 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.980
 I'm creative if I take off the 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:06.320
 creative I would not be hungry but good 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:10.660
 there it is after we have the sleeping 

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:12.520
 bags this can not be put on the floor 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.700
 it has to be to forces below one of 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.970
 you are in a patent here you can 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.560
 sleep 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.030
 good when it's night you can 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.370
 sleep now 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:24.870
 and we also have this that was coming 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.020
 the text theme this will help us 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:29.400
 make the tents these white is carte 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:30.950
 with an iron and one of these that 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:32.780
 I said before 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:35.030
 then we are here with string and once 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:38.510
 we play the k navas I do not know how 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:40.760
 translate this truth canvas I do not know what 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.810
 with 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:48.060
 with five of these and two of these 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.550
 we created a folder of these and well the 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.020
 we put there a detail that you notice is that 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.210
 no you can not put it pointing towards 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.830
 there or good, well, if it goes there 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.260
 simply to forces you have to aim 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.390
 the chair 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.970
 I do not know if they will solve it or not 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.070
 I know how long I have this but good 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:08.560
 there you can put chests down 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:08.560
 also but a chest 

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:14.530
 it's already here you have a jet of space 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.960
 more is good because you can actually 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.699
 It not so expensive 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:22.259
 I do not know if this is going to be seen in the video 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.259
 but good 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:27.670
 good 

00:05:27.689 --> 00:05:31.709
 I say it's good but not really because 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.330
 maybe will cost you to be a 

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:35.669
 home or faster to do one of these 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.049
 because you have to find iron for 

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.280
 create this you have to count at least 6 

00:05:37.049 --> 00:05:39.960
 of iron 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.690
 but hey this is in case you want to go 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.580
 one day being close to a mine or not 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.810
 outside of your house is fine adds 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.880
 Minecraft variety as always 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.660
 we also have these characters here 

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.660
 What are they 

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.710
 as in Spanish they are campers and good if 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:59.199
 you give him three of these give you one 

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:01.599
 Emerald have more have one each 

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:02.949
 came here have several things you 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:04.900
 you can change several things here we have 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:07.090
 a mochilita this can not be graphed 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:09.000
 you simply get them from my 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.680
 backs 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.540
 here you can save whatever you want 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:15.160
 not several little things 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:17.250
 and we're going to look for another one there's also 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:21.630
 women right now to see if we find a 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.630
 well here we have these are as guides 

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:28.620
 I think you have to fill in the 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:31.040
 I really do not know I have no idea but good 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.040
 they are days 

00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:37.720
 let's see if we find a quick woman 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:39.529
 well this is man 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:41.479
 good to see 

00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:43.639
 this is they give you one of these and you give 

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:44.959
 one of these I do not know if it makes it more 

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:47.149
 easy to do one of these that get 

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:49.030
 an emerald a woman is burning 

00:06:47.149 --> 00:06:51.640
 because I pass by here 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:53.260
 Let's see what he gives us and he gives us 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:55.060
 music these women and others 

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.140
 are men really there is not so much 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:59.920
 difference simply that these are 

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.570
 green and these are reds and güeritos and 

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:04.030
 well that's it, that's basically 

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:06.430
 I hope all you liked the mod 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.720
 As you can see, they answered a lot, so 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.430
 I see 

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.020
 I think that only answer in this area 

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:14.380
 because I've been in the snow for a while now and 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.910
 I saw none but good I would go to 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.040
 stay near a forest or in some 

00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:20.290
 place more different than this but good 

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.750
 it's fine I hope you like the video and 

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:25.300
 simple works with molds and has a 

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:28.060
 automatic installer is much better if 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:31.419
 use this the automatic ones I installed it 

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:32.620
 manually but not so I do not know 

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:34.780
 if the installer goes very well 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.100
 automatic but good there comes and I hope 

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.690
 that you liked already liked the 

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.690
 iphone and subscribe all that until then
