00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
dependable as they are this I think is

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.050 
dependable as they are this I think is
more<00:02:03.170> dependable<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.980> that's<00:02:04.520> why<00:02:04.670> you<00:02:04.730> see

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
more dependable and that's why you see

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.450 
more dependable and that's why you see
more<00:02:05.330> and<00:02:05.360> more<00:02:05.540> of<00:02:05.870> the<00:02:05.990> forces<00:02:06.410> around<00:02:07.280> the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
more and more of the forces around the

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.490 
more and more of the forces around the
world<00:02:07.670> going<00:02:08.030> back<00:02:08.269> to<00:02:08.479> this<00:02:08.599> thing<00:02:08.899> it's<00:02:09.229> been

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
world going back to this thing it's been

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.580 
world going back to this thing it's been
around<00:02:09.739> for<00:02:10.009> a<00:02:10.039> while<00:02:10.250> I<00:02:10.580> think<00:02:11.060> the<00:02:11.209> name

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
around for a while I think the name

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.009 
around for a while I think the name
maybe<00:02:12.590> since<00:02:13.010> 1958<00:02:13.879> when<00:02:14.239> it<00:02:14.360> was<00:02:14.510> introduced

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
maybe since 1958 when it was introduced

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:16.140 
maybe since 1958 when it was introduced
and<00:02:15.290> there<00:02:15.409> have<00:02:15.500> been<00:02:15.530> some<00:02:15.800> improvements

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
and there have been some improvements

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.759 
and there have been some improvements
this<00:02:17.150> particular<00:02:17.720> one<00:02:17.900> is<00:02:18.110> the<00:02:18.140> Century<00:02:18.620> Arms

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
this particular one is the Century Arms

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.580 
this particular one is the Century Arms
which<00:02:19.670> has<00:02:20.030> american<00:02:20.780> barrel

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
which has american barrel

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.800 
which has american barrel
and<00:02:21.709> I<00:02:22.160> think<00:02:22.400> an<00:02:22.520> American<00:02:22.760> receiver<00:02:23.390> it's<00:02:23.660> a

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
and I think an American receiver it's a

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.830 
and I think an American receiver it's a
