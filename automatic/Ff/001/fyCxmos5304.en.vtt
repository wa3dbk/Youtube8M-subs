hey guys I haven't put anything out a
while<00:00:03.210> I've<00:00:03.540> been<00:00:03.570> working<00:00:03.929> on<00:00:03.990> some<00:00:04.170> response

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
while I've been working on some response

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.660 
while I've been working on some response
tough<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.220> it's<00:00:05.339> been<00:00:05.460> kicking<00:00:06.270> my<00:00:06.390> ass<00:00:06.420> I

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
tough and it's been kicking my ass I

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.360 
tough and it's been kicking my ass I
think<00:00:08.670> I<00:00:08.730> figured<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:09.059> out<00:00:09.179> talk<00:00:09.599> to<00:00:09.719> frizz

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:10.370 
think I figured it out talk to frizz

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.650 
think I figured it out talk to frizz
basically<00:00:11.370> I<00:00:12.710> don't<00:00:13.710> want<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:13.950> admit<00:00:14.040> it's<00:00:14.660> my

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
basically I don't want to admit it's my

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.510 
basically I don't want to admit it's my
fault<00:00:15.990> or<00:00:16.379> even<00:00:16.920> though<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.039> actually<00:00:17.250> don't

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
fault or even though I actually don't

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.519 
fault or even though I actually don't
think<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.210> more<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.020> instructions

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
think it is is more of the instructions

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.109 
think it is is more of the instructions
i<00:00:19.650> was<00:00:19.770> given<00:00:20.039> originally<00:00:20.609> when<00:00:20.760> i<00:00:20.820> first

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
i was given originally when i first

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.380 
i was given originally when i first
became<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.480> director<00:00:21.830> it<00:00:22.830> said<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.490> make<00:00:24.359> sure

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
became a director it said to make sure

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.380 
became a director it said to make sure
the<00:00:24.600> settings<00:00:24.930> were<00:00:25.230> exactly<00:00:26.060> you<00:00:27.060> know<00:00:27.150> as

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
the settings were exactly you know as

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.779 
the settings were exactly you know as
written<00:00:27.840> and<00:00:28.019> i<00:00:28.890> was<00:00:29.010> following<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.580> and

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
written and i was following that and

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.120 
written and i was following that and
basically<00:00:30.300> what<00:00:31.080> i<00:00:31.109> found<00:00:31.289> out<00:00:31.470> it<00:00:31.679> was<00:00:31.830> the

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
basically what i found out it was the

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.049 
basically what i found out it was the
wrong<00:00:32.369> thing<00:00:33.290> where<00:00:34.700> wasn't<00:00:35.700> necessarily

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
wrong thing where wasn't necessarily

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.180 
wrong thing where wasn't necessarily
wrong<00:00:36.300> but<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.079> was<00:00:37.170> just<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.559> minimum<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:38.100> i

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
wrong but it was just the minimum and i

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.860 
wrong but it was just the minimum and i
was<00:00:38.340> trying<00:00:38.579> to<00:00:38.640> get<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.879> in<00:00:38.910> HD<00:00:39.120> which<00:00:39.570> wasn't

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
was trying to get it in HD which wasn't

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.630 
was trying to get it in HD which wasn't
happening<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:40.860> figured<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.489> was<00:00:41.610> just

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
happening but figured out it was just

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.990 
happening but figured out it was just
some<00:00:42.180> whatever<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.290> it's<00:00:43.980> fixed<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.700> I'm

whatever we that's basically why i'm
doing<00:01:27.540> this<00:01:27.659> video<00:01:27.869> is<00:01:28.200> because<00:01:28.460> this

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
doing this video is because this

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.370 
doing this video is because this
gameplay<00:01:29.820> actually<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.450> not<00:01:30.659> for<00:01:30.930> me<00:01:31.049> it's

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
gameplay actually is not for me it's

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.039 
gameplay actually is not for me it's
from<00:01:31.680> Loki<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:33.509> reason<00:01:33.750> why<00:01:33.840> it's<00:01:33.930> from

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
from Loki and the reason why it's from

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.569 
from Loki and the reason why it's from
Loki<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.350> because<00:01:34.740> that's<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.159> person<00:01:35.369> we

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
Loki is because that's the person we

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.480
