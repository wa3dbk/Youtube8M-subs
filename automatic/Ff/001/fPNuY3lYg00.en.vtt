benefit of the doubt and there were lots

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.420 
benefit of the doubt and there were lots
of<00:03:28.260> times<00:03:28.320> when<00:03:28.709> her<00:03:28.829> actions<00:03:29.250> were

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
of times when her actions were

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.400 
of times when her actions were
interpreted<00:03:30.530> extremely<00:03:31.530> unfairly<00:03:32.390> when<00:03:33.410> she

interpreted extremely unfairly when she

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.970

behaved from very good and
straightforward<00:03:38.700> reasons<00:03:39.090> which<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.989> media

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
straightforward reasons which the media

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.160 
straightforward reasons which the media
interpreted<00:03:41.239> in<00:03:42.239> very<00:03:42.660> different<00:03:42.870> ways
