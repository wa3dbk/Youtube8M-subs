assemble and use the Scooba back by
cojito<00:00:11.339> our<00:00:12.339> first<00:00:12.580> step<00:00:12.790> is<00:00:12.820> to<00:00:13.089> make<00:00:13.179> sure

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
cojito our first step is to make sure

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.180 
cojito our first step is to make sure
that<00:00:13.599> we've<00:00:13.750> got<00:00:13.900> all<00:00:14.169> the<00:00:14.290> parts<00:00:14.559> we<00:00:14.710> need<00:00:14.740> we

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:15.190 
that we've got all the parts we need we

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.259 
that we've got all the parts we need we
should<00:00:15.400> have<00:00:15.610> a<00:00:15.849> main<00:00:16.330> body<00:00:16.570> a<00:00:17.010> vacuum<00:00:18.010> head

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:18.269 
should have a main body a vacuum head

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.179 
should have a main body a vacuum head
for<00:00:19.269> poles<00:00:19.710> for<00:00:20.710> connectors<00:00:21.220> and<00:00:21.519> a<00:00:21.970> hose<00:00:22.180> our

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
for poles for connectors and a hose our

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.269 
for poles for connectors and a hose our
first<00:00:24.189> step<00:00:24.430> is<00:00:24.609> to<00:00:24.670> assemble<00:00:25.150> our<00:00:25.480> vacuum

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
first step is to assemble our vacuum

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.249 
first step is to assemble our vacuum
they'll<00:00:27.279> start<00:00:27.609> by<00:00:27.849> attaching<00:00:28.420> your<00:00:28.750> vacuum

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
they'll start by attaching your vacuum

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:35.790 
they'll start by attaching your vacuum
head<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.789> the<00:00:30.880> vacuum<00:00:31.240> body<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:35.260> want<00:00:35.469> a<00:00:35.500> tight

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
head to the vacuum body you want a tight

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.210 
head to the vacuum body you want a tight
seal<00:00:36.100> on<00:00:36.160> this

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:42.220 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.670 

then<00:00:42.790> you'll<00:00:42.970> insert<00:00:43.360> the<00:00:43.660> smaller<00:00:44.050> end<00:00:44.410> with

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
then you'll insert the smaller end with

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.720 
then you'll insert the smaller end with
the<00:00:44.770> grooves<00:00:45.240> into<00:00:46.240> the<00:00:46.810> other<00:00:47.290> side<00:00:47.650> of<00:00:47.950> the

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
the grooves into the other side of the

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:51.600 
the grooves into the other side of the
body<00:00:49.230> I'm<00:00:50.230> going<00:00:50.350> to<00:00:50.440> get<00:00:50.530> that<00:00:50.680> as<00:00:50.860> tight<00:00:51.040> and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
body I'm going to get that as tight and

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.370 
body I'm going to get that as tight and
insert<00:00:52.000> that<00:00:52.030> as<00:00:52.270> far<00:00:52.480> as<00:00:52.510> you<00:00:52.750> can<00:00:52.960> in<00:00:53.200> there

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:53.380 
insert that as far as you can in there

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.860 
insert that as far as you can in there
to<00:00:53.650> make<00:00:53.770> sure<00:00:53.920> you've<00:00:54.070> got<00:00:54.100> a<00:00:54.220> great<00:00:54.460> seal

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
to make sure you've got a great seal

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.420 
to make sure you've got a great seal
then<00:00:55.870> you'll<00:00:56.050> continue<00:00:56.530> to<00:00:56.560> assemble<00:00:57.130> the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
then you'll continue to assemble the

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.570 
then you'll continue to assemble the
pole<00:00:57.640> around<00:00:57.790> it<00:01:02.100> we've<00:01:03.100> got<00:01:03.220> your<00:01:03.370> pole

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
pole around it we've got your pole

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.189 
pole around it we've got your pole
completely<00:01:04.030> built<00:01:04.270> the<00:01:04.510> last<00:01:04.660> thing<00:01:04.900> to<00:01:05.020> do<00:01:05.170> is

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:05.199 
completely built the last thing to do is

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.650 
completely built the last thing to do is
to<00:01:05.740> attach<00:01:05.980> the<00:01:06.430> hose<00:01:06.640> so<00:01:07.360> you'll<00:01:07.480> take<00:01:07.600> the

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:07.660 
to attach the hose so you'll take the

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.100 
to attach the hose so you'll take the
larger<00:01:08.050> end<00:01:08.230> and<00:01:09.300> it'll<00:01:10.300> go<00:01:10.420> right<00:01:10.450> over<00:01:11.080> that

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
larger end and it'll go right over that

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.240 
larger end and it'll go right over that
ring<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:14.320> want<00:01:14.410> to<00:01:14.530> push<00:01:14.650> that<00:01:14.770> on<00:01:14.950> there<00:01:15.130> as

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
ring you want to push that on there as

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.330 
ring you want to push that on there as
far<00:01:15.460> as<00:01:15.580> you<00:01:15.700> can<00:01:15.910> to<00:01:16.900> get<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.110> nice<00:01:17.440> tight<00:01:17.830> seal

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.530 

now<00:01:21.340> we<00:01:21.400> need<00:01:21.610> to<00:01:21.700> hook<00:01:21.820> it<00:01:21.970> up<00:01:22.060> to<00:01:22.210> your<00:01:22.270> pool

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
now we need to hook it up to your pool

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.540 
now we need to hook it up to your pool
make<00:01:23.170> sure<00:01:23.320> to<00:01:23.470> turn<00:01:23.650> your<00:01:23.830> pump<00:01:23.979> off<00:01:24.160> if<00:01:24.369> we're

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:24.550 
make sure to turn your pump off if we're

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.980 
make sure to turn your pump off if we're
connecting<00:01:24.940> your<00:01:25.060> scuba<00:01:25.330> back<00:01:25.570> to<00:01:25.720> the<00:01:25.810> water

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
connecting your scuba back to the water

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.100
