00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.830

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.450
 This Christmas the children were out of class. 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.780
 They called me and told me this. 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.690
 I sensed a lot I said I'm going to 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.290
 leverage a cause greater than just 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.730
 send a lunch to these children in 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:58.090
 commemorative dates 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:59.920
 the rumor arose is the couple approached the 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.140
 association in the period in which the director 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.570
 fought a cancer and now that 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.180
 if it was up to her to continue the 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.180
 work and the most beautiful way that I 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.009
 I found it honorable on a date 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.170
 it would be his birthday but he would be 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.750
 I told 102 people I did not 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.970
 I want to miss 62 years old 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.860
 what is the first birthday after 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.520
 death so recent at the plant in 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.520
 four months still 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:30.229
 xisco 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.580
 here are his clothes too his clothes 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:39.710
 donated, not yet has it because the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.390
 house is closed and we have not arrived 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.880
 Nothing at all in the house but with 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.030
 sure the daughters will soon 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.640
 Release aaa his wardrobe to 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.190
 people also gives them support for a project 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.190
 So with you, no, I did not. 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.470
 no one but I am absolutely sure that 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.640
 no one was going to be indisposed for a cause 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.259
 so noble, right? 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.780
 it is worth remembering that soon after the death 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.149
 of the director began a lawsuit 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.039
 to safeguard the rights of 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.619
 until the testament was 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:11.480
 open publications have stated that antônia 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.550
 fontenelle would have been invited to 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.620

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.050
 has alessandra flavia who has a 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.330
 daughter with him would have had to change the 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.040
 door locks how are you? 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.040
 so after everything you 've been through 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.959
 I think that yes I got very bad 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.820
 very bad in the first two months after 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.820
 death I got really bad they can not 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:37.850
 food is that thing that you all 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.370
 They already know it already has been said and such but I am 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:42.739
 Very strong, thanks God, I had it then. 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.410
 a moment came that I told myself 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:46.730
 I have a lot to solve this. 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:49.430
 here is one of them 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.650
 the film is another adornment and boats 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.120
 worked together producing long 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.820
 footage when he came to die 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.640
 from a pulmonary embolism but still 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.500
 I am re-adapting bureaucracy because 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.329
 company was found naked on video of 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.190
 capital to enter the resources that 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.739
 were entering the end of the year 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:12.049
 I wasted all this because they are almost 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:15.769
 two years of work and and it was was 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:18.250
 an absurd irresponsibility 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.250
 measure 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.840
 how was the company closed on the milestones? 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.510
 so is all that I told you I 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.990
 I think it's extremely well explained. 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:34.870
 understood the company was blocked is that 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:38.710
 closed the company aloqa so that 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:41.920
 I could not work and capture in 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:45.310
 company's name enplan that process that 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.530
 the panache sons and daughter in several 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:50.140
 measures this was one of them is 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:52.810
 only one that hurt me 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.010
 otherwise nothing hurt me what is a 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.440
 thing that I 'm having to have 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.120
 because it was a big movie that I was 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:03.370
 working two years ago 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:06.280
 the question of inheritance was how it is 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.160
 That's when I have to answer that I 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.650
 I can not answer about this one that was 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.290
 delegate functions and this is not my 

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.390
 function and I have spoken once will repeat 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.489
 I told you once to see that the 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.299
 same time download rewind the tape but 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.250
 it was not what I can help 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.050
 asking I understand that we have 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.280
 curiosity to know but it is necessary that 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.540
 people understand that the more 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.020
 We're talking about a more complicated subject. 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:31.090
 It stays so is the landmarks as a 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.790

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.650

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.520
 justice will understand for sure and 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.530
 wrong 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.229
 I 'm not at all worried that I've already 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.090
