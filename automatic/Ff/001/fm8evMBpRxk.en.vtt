with his neuer and I really doubt that
thing<00:01:24.030> is<00:01:24.299> scarf<00:01:24.840> because<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.380> thing<00:01:25.619> is<00:01:25.950> only

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
thing is scarf because I thing is only

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.240 
thing is scarf because I thing is only
speed<00:01:26.970> so<00:01:27.299> running<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.350> scarf<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:28.979> in<00:01:29.070> my

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
speed so running a scarf on it in my

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.390 
speed so running a scarf on it in my
opinion<00:01:29.579> is<00:01:30.090> not<00:01:31.079> really<00:01:31.439> worth<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.890> at<00:01:32.040> all<00:01:32.159> so

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
opinion is not really worth it at all so

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.499

encore anything he wants to go for be it

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.270 
encore anything he wants to go for be it
stealth<00:03:21.079> rocks<00:03:21.319> or<00:03:21.530> earthquakes<00:03:22.069> and

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:22.280 
stealth rocks or earthquakes and

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:24.129 
stealth rocks or earthquakes and
earthquake<00:03:22.730> doesn't<00:03:23.060> do<00:03:23.209> anything<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.810> me<00:03:23.930> and

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:24.139 
earthquake doesn't do anything to me and

00:03:24.139 --> 00:03:26.080 
earthquake doesn't do anything to me and
obviously<00:03:24.290> if<00:03:24.829> he<00:03:25.310> gets<00:03:25.489> on<00:03:25.639> cord<00:03:25.940> into

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
obviously if he gets on cord into

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:27.339 
obviously if he gets on cord into
stealth<00:03:26.419> rocks<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:26.870> that's<00:03:26.989> literally

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
stealth rocks and that's literally

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.940 
stealth rocks and that's literally
useless<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.660> I<00:03:29.690> go<00:03:29.840> for<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.109> Encore<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.799> he's

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
useless so I go for the Encore and he's

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.229
