00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
taofledermaus back in 2012 we shot one

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.340 
taofledermaus back in 2012 we shot one
of<00:00:19.140> these<00:00:19.289> Flint<00:00:20.189> tip<00:00:20.580> slugs<00:00:21.029> at<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.330> mild<00:00:21.990> steel

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
of these Flint tip slugs at a mild steel

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.540 
of these Flint tip slugs at a mild steel
plate<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.019> essentially<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:28.710> we<00:00:28.830> made<00:00:29.010> was<00:00:29.279> an

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
plate so essentially what we made was an

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.690 
plate so essentially what we made was an
incendiary<00:00:30.710> shotgun<00:00:31.710> rounded<00:00:32.130> threw<00:00:32.460> up<00:00:32.520> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
incendiary shotgun rounded threw up a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.740 
incendiary shotgun rounded threw up a
lot<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.910> sparks<00:00:33.530> sent<00:00:34.530> the<00:00:34.649> plate<00:00:34.890> flying<00:00:35.309> and

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
lot of sparks sent the plate flying and

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.170 
lot of sparks sent the plate flying and
left<00:00:36.750> a<00:00:37.020> pretty<00:00:37.649> decent<00:00:38.610> dent<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.210> plate

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
left a pretty decent dent in that plate

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.090 
left a pretty decent dent in that plate
so<00:00:42.180> we<00:00:42.420> brought<00:00:42.960> this<00:00:43.170> round<00:00:43.410> back<00:00:43.590> out<00:00:43.829> put

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
so we brought this round back out put

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.029 
so we brought this round back out put
some<00:00:44.610> sandbags<00:00:45.300> behind<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:46.170> plate<00:00:46.620> since

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
some sandbags behind the plate since

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.910 
some sandbags behind the plate since
people<00:00:47.250> think<00:00:47.579> that's<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:48.120> vital<00:00:49.020> factor<00:00:49.620> in

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
people think that's a vital factor in

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.549 
people think that's a vital factor in
these<00:00:50.100> tests<00:00:50.520> Oh

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
these tests Oh

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.650 
these tests Oh
so<00:00:52.980> hopefully<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.460> naysayers<00:00:54.000> are<00:00:54.149> satisfied

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
so hopefully the naysayers are satisfied

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.330 
so hopefully the naysayers are satisfied
with<00:00:54.899> how<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.110> did<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.559> test<00:00:56.989> damn<00:00:57.989> oh<00:00:58.340> it's

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
with how we did this test damn oh it's

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.700 
with how we did this test damn oh it's
smoking<00:01:00.920> look<00:01:01.920> at<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.870> I'm<00:01:03.870> sure<00:01:04.080> people<00:01:04.320> find

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
smoking look at it I'm sure people find

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.880 
smoking look at it I'm sure people find
something<00:01:05.519> wrong<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.150> video<00:01:06.479> though

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
something wrong with this video though

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.649 
something wrong with this video though
now<00:01:07.890> when<00:01:08.070> we<00:01:08.189> shot<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:08.729> didn't<00:01:09.030> see<00:01:09.240> any

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
now when we shot it we didn't see any

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.289 
now when we shot it we didn't see any
sparks<00:01:10.200> at<00:01:10.350> all<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.880> even<00:01:11.880> in<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.090> high-speed

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
sparks at all and even in the high-speed

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.630 
sparks at all and even in the high-speed
footage<00:01:12.689> there<00:01:13.049> are<00:01:13.350> no<00:01:13.950> sparks

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
footage there are no sparks

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.149 
footage there are no sparks
now<00:01:15.420> we've<00:01:15.570> shot<00:01:15.840> this<00:01:15.990> plate<00:01:16.259> numerous<00:01:16.830> times

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
now we've shot this plate numerous times

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.780 
now we've shot this plate numerous times
and<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.000> thick<00:01:18.540> pax<00:01:18.960> con<00:01:19.409> coating<00:01:20.130> which<00:01:20.759> is

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
and the thick pax con coating which is

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.870 
and the thick pax con coating which is
like<00:01:21.119> a<00:01:21.150> bedliner<00:01:21.689> coating<00:01:22.369> is<00:01:23.369> starting<00:01:23.790> to

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
like a bedliner coating is starting to

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.390 
like a bedliner coating is starting to
delaminate<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.320> did<00:01:25.530> see<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.860> little<00:01:26.040> bit<00:01:26.280> of

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
delaminate so we did see a little bit of

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.580 
delaminate so we did see a little bit of
material<00:01:27.270> shoot<00:01:27.720> out<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.049> side<00:01:28.290> but

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
material shoot out the side but

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.620 
material shoot out the side but
definitely<00:01:29.369> didn't<00:01:29.579> see<00:01:29.729> any<00:01:29.909> sparks<00:01:30.420> shoot

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
definitely didn't see any sparks shoot

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.810 
definitely didn't see any sparks shoot
out<00:01:30.810> which<00:01:31.290> kind<00:01:31.590> of<00:01:31.680> surprised<00:01:32.040> us<00:01:32.340> I<00:01:32.549> don't

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
standing off to the right of this plate

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.469

and<00:01:36.799> this<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.040> plate<00:01:38.400> after<00:01:38.880> we<00:01:39.060> shot<00:01:39.299> it

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
and this is the plate after we shot it

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.370 
and this is the plate after we shot it
on<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.860> backside<00:01:41.310> really<00:01:42.000> not<00:01:42.960> much<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> a

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.679 
deformation there and then back at home
we<00:01:47.100> removed<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.700> rest<00:01:47.939> of<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:48.240> packs<00:01:48.479> con

coating and really not much of a dent
they're<00:01:52.049> just<00:01:52.290> a<00:01:52.380> little<00:01:52.560> dark<00:01:52.860> spot<00:01:53.450> I'd<00:01:54.450> say

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
they're just a little dark spot I'd say

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.170
