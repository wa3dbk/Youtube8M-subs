 that really has me very passionate 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.119
 even if it has repetitive traits in some places 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.060
 but for those who follow the story 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.619
 of the other hitman is really full of 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.890
 twists especially at the beginning 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:33.540
 and it's really a nice nice game 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.759
 so let's say the boys procedure is 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.820
 simple but we have to where you want 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:42.270
 always go to that site that showed 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.170
 past videos then game store.com 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.630
 for everyone, even at the level of children 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.649
 details you can't understand 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.570
 you can go and see more 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.149
 Detailed the video before in which of 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.649
 stuff for all so much more 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.060
 detailed steps I'm doing 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.540
 so now let's try hitman 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.969
 absolution almost intimate on buscar e e 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.489
 let 's try to find them here again 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.709
 page then pc games certainly man 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.310
 solution here's the first spanish nothing 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.560
 so yesterday 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.230
 the second was many 8 cra hill skids 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:23.230
 row so let's download this torrent a 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:26.590
 guys that I wanted to remember that these 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.900
 there are purely demonstrative and not 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.670
 I want to incite anyone to download the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.030
 game pirating but bought i 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.290
 games support those who make them now they are 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.150
 at this point we have 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.709
 downloaded the torrent we opened vi 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.900
 you will find nothing in front of these rar 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:46.799
 afraid as I told you already in the video 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:50.370
 previous because it is part of the game 

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:54.060
 after we will see how ok so we give 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:58.569
 let's go ok let's download 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.670
 will explain 6 7 hours 5 of pil is invaded 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:04.870
 from the connection we may have 10 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:09.130
 20 mega base also from the modem anyway 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:12.250
 once downloaded and not remove 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.709
 remove pies data only remove because 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.079
 so it only removes the tower and grandparents 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.209
 data also inside 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:25.030
 so now we will have to go 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:26.739
 to the folder we have here 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.109
 we have sent downloads to 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:33.400
 utorrent I for example let go of the 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:36.220
 my dog download torrent and hitler 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.319
 absolution here it is multi 8 pc dvd calculations 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:44.920
 now the screen that appears in front of you 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:46.630
 this first thing to do is indeed seems 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.660
 unpack the first and second 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.650
 package the first and second silent that 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.000
 it would be skid row that will go from crack e 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:59.440
 be hitman absolution the first mi 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.790
 I recommend extract files and I would be files that 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.019
 He had so he always makes these fans 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:06.639
 less than creating a folder there 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:09.310
 leave as with extracts here a so iso 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:13.480
 then scattered once we have indeed 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:17.289
 pato a both both our 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:21.459
 zip we will open for the first hitman 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:23.320
 Absolution what this is here now 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.000
 simple iso image as I said 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.880
 the other time with damon tus we will go to 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.570
 mount 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.570
 virtual 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.470
 sorry perfect autorun if you have 

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:43.910
 windows 8 autorun is normal windows 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:45.680
 natural normal small setup yes language 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:47.240
 Italian and then clearly you will go 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.980
 forward you will choose where to put it e 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.100
 you'll finish installations I don't finish it 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.530
 because clearly I've already installed it 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:56.720
 for those for example by distraction or 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.340
 you accidentally lose the autorun you can 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.370
 always go to this virtual unit 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.830
 that your computer recognize how 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:06.440
 cd go to setup and start 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:08.030
 perfect installation so now we are 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.290
 in the middle of the work because if we go 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:11.810
 in the folder where we installed 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.790
 the game for example the green carrier 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:18.260
 jockey club solutions we will find ourselves 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:20.870
 in front of this but this situation 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.240
 now the game if you try it took no 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.770
 it will work clearly because it had to 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.160
 be given to crack so let's go back 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.690
 to the folder and back to the torrent 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.090
 downloaded first then download 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.620
 torrent hitman absolution 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:35.480
 you remember the file we had 

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:39.610
 unpacked first here now we will need it 

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:43.400
 very simply we open the torrent e 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:46.070
 excuse the folder and we have to 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:50.360
 then copy these five files 

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:54.140
 let's say copy let's go to the 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.000
 game for me will be having the games green 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.030
 web solutions you usually true 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.880
 put up a programs for 86 and 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:03.410
 we simply paste you dates 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.640
 which is then clearly established ce 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:08.240
 he already has it on that side so not in 

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:10.160
 neck or then replace and you will be asked 

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.200
 even maybe some permission to 

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.280
 administrative level you give the bikes 

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.100
 quietly ok 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:20.500
 so what is ready and the download is 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.139
 was executed correctly and 

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:26.200
 jacket in operation I remind you that 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:28.419
 clearly the game mode will be 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.760
 purely offline clearly online 

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:31.650
 you can't 

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.730
 minimally play it just because a 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.010
 cracked game and therefore nothing 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:42.330
 enjoy this game because it really 

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:44.010
 a game with a certain beauty and the 

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:46.800
 full of challenges because then it is a bit 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:49.740
 repetitive however I have been there on and 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:54.420
 for what I've been on a bit of a 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:56.580
 some of hours and I was nice because de 

00:06:54.420 --> 00:07:01.280
 really changes compared to how it was 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:04.170
 like renault iwaki tmac is really 

00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:11.670
 nice so then those of this game 

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:13.260
 past 8 9 hours in finishing it is ok my 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:17.150
 video tutorial ends here not there 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:19.620
 I will clearly show the opening of the game 

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:23.970
 as I have also told you so 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:29.010
 Last video for privacy issues 

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:31.350
 and such things cannot open it 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:32.970
 as downloaded the game is done 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:34.500
 see how to download it then it was 

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:38.130
 purely demonstrative but in any case not 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.690
 discover and leave nothing to ourselves 

00:07:38.130 --> 00:07:41.910
