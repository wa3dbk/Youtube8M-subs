00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.320

gets to that dark color that does have
carcinogens<00:03:10.050> in<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.890> that's<00:03:11.160> why<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.730> think

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
carcinogens in it so that's why I think

so<00:03:35.760> they<00:03:35.790> were<00:03:36.120> like<00:03:36.240> what<00:03:37.080> are<00:03:37.110> we<00:03:37.200> going<00:03:37.350> to

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
so they were like what are we going to

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.800 
so they were like what are we going to
do<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:38.100> they<00:03:38.250> actually<00:03:38.370> use<00:03:38.700> pea<00:03:39.090> protein<00:03:39.300> in

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
do so they actually use pea protein in

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.610 
do so they actually use pea protein in
it<00:03:39.930> I<00:03:40.200> tried<00:03:40.860> the<00:03:41.400> other<00:03:41.430> flavor<00:03:42.530> can't<00:03:43.530> they
