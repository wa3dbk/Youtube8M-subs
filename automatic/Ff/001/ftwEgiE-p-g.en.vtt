00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.870
 good video training today, you 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.820
 play two songs right 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.559
 This is very good when you want to do it. 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.549
 a video that puts multiple songs 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.609
 together 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:21.480
 without getting those parties right or not 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:23.220
 here the trio already in the program radio city is 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.000
 that this program here then I'm going to give 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.859
 two clicks here is very simple even there 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.239
 What are you going to do next? 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.550
 of the file therein on that subscriber 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.070
 import audio 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:43.469
 So you can choose here, right? 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:46.710
 I'm going to put this song here and I'll click 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:50.010
 here in time management tool 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.920
 then click here you can drag the 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.100
 another song where you want to leave it 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.379
 comes to re-importing audio and 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.480
 choose another song you can choose 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.150
 anyone here is funk tequileiras 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:09.450
 takes a very funk phase 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.460
 Look, I got a mix and here. 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.020
 what happens is that at the end of the 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.200
 I know the beginning of this afternoon I 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.610
 I do think about here is O 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.070
 a timeline 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.439
 You'll see when I put it in here. 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.700
 So I set the music for myself and 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.040
 I want her to touch 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.900
 Then you put on the test there. 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.900
 see the thing you want good then 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.369
 now you will have a task of 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.880
 to reverse 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:54.960
 I 'm not that night, little shoe. 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.899

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.899

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:14.640
 you can not really space is already large, 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.930
 this song that you do then you give 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.650
 but I got it here see the time it starts 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.650
 more or less 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.700
 I will not give regulating and descending good 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:58.420
 part of the voice is here so I'm going 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:58.420
 I'll take this space here the opaque 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:10.670
 Stage rate leaves him I'm going to play here 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:15.079

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:36.530
 It's okay, a well-beating rose is going now. 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:39.769
 This can tell me can pull more 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:44.959
 a little bit here I 'm going to make a 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:48.270
 test that really knows this way and now 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:55.830
 you will have 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:04:05.340
 no time to work out, that 's it now 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:06.540
 partner, good bomber, that's it, then I 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.190
 I think this video lesson that is 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.410
 important for anyone who wants to do and edit 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.710
 video and I'm going to take a class now. 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:16.020
 How to make how to take audio from 

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:18.510
 music that people can not even imagine 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.520
 What I do is so easy in the making book. 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.670
 so come on, I'll save this 

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.590
 project now called export export 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.970
 here you have to change the name is the 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.970
 first name so I can put it here 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.920
 there save 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.840
 OK 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:39.210
 there it will show a sentence saying that 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.450
 He's going to mix music so let's go. 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:41.450

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:56.410
 a monster once known here 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:13.270
 nor did she show the sentence but she already did the 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:18.640
 total mix is what I'm going to leave 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.840
 he train let's see it's very simple right? 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.590
