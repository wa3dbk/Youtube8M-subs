00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
Army has a significantly larger budget a

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.130 
Army has a significantly larger budget a
wider<00:01:17.100> global<00:01:17.580> presence<00:01:17.960> potentially<00:01:18.960> more

wider global presence potentially more

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.990 
wider global presence potentially more
combat<00:01:19.590> time<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.100> bigger<00:01:20.369> scope<00:01:20.729> of

military occupational specialties this

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:29.180 
military occupational specialties this
basically<00:01:28.170> means<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.500> it<00:01:28.740> needs<00:01:28.770> more

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 
basically means that it needs more

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.419 
basically means that it needs more
leaders<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.729> officers<00:01:29.910> to<00:01:30.330> manage<00:01:30.840> itself

which<00:01:32.429> is<00:01:32.640> why<00:01:32.670> there<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.149> greater<00:01:33.539> chance

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:33.899 
which is why there is a greater chance

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:34.999 
which is why there is a greater chance
for<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> promotion
