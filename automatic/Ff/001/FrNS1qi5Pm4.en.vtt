00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.490 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.359> it's<00:00:00.480> a<00:00:00.659> now<00:00:00.870> taking<00:00:01.140> we're<00:00:01.260> looking

00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
I think it's a now taking we're looking

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.560 
I think it's a now taking we're looking
at<00:00:01.589> the<00:00:01.740> what<00:00:02.370> supposedly<00:00:02.790> meant<00:00:03.149> to<00:00:03.300> be<00:00:03.419> the

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
at the what supposedly meant to be the

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.460 
at the what supposedly meant to be the
blackberry<00:00:04.080> bold<00:00:04.290> 9900<00:00:05.279> the<00:00:06.150> r-47<00:00:06.720> as<00:00:07.200> it<00:00:07.350> is

9850<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.870> believe<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.620> the<00:00:47.039> background<00:00:47.250> so

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
9850 I believe is in the background so

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.029 
9850 I believe is in the background so
this<00:00:48.360> could<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:48.780> reliable<00:00:49.050> source<00:00:49.469> you<00:00:49.920> know

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
this could be a reliable source you know

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.470 
this could be a reliable source you know
he<00:00:50.219> could<00:00:50.399> be<00:00:50.430> getting<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:51.149> lot<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> these

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
he could be getting a lot of these

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.450 
he could be getting a lot of these
concept<00:00:52.020> phones<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.739> front<00:00:52.980> straight<00:00:53.399> from

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
concept phones in front straight from

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.049 
concept phones in front straight from
the<00:00:53.579> factory<00:00:53.789> not<00:00:54.719> sure<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.550> mostly<00:00:56.550> this

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
the factory not sure but mostly this

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.720 
the factory not sure but mostly this
looks<00:00:57.270> mainly<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.840> be<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:57.989> hardware<00:00:58.730> so

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
looks mainly to be a hardware so

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.660 
looks mainly to be a hardware so
exterior<00:01:00.239> appearance<00:01:01.190> redesigned<00:01:02.190> but<00:01:02.489> i

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
exterior appearance redesigned but i

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.030 
exterior appearance redesigned but i
think<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.449> specs<00:01:03.780> will<00:01:03.989> be<00:01:04.080> really<00:01:04.830> similar

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
think the specs will be really similar

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.660 
think the specs will be really similar
to<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.309> 9900<00:01:06.299> which<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:06.600> out<00:01:07.369> which<00:01:08.369> been<00:01:08.549> out

it pressed into the actual battle over

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.530 
it pressed into the actual battle over
himself<00:01:46.490> so<00:01:47.490> it<00:01:47.700> looks<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.090> ensure<00:01:48.329> the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
himself so it looks like to ensure the

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.179 
himself so it looks like to ensure the
battery<00:01:49.110> battery<00:01:49.439> just<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.710> prove<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.159> a
