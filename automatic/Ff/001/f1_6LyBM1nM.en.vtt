00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.930
 Hello dear friends and in this 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.300
 video i want to tell you how to do 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:15.880
 homemade salt for the engine in 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.950
 home conditions 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:25.100
 let's go and for that we will need 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:27.050
 wheel tiny machine handle bolt 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.010
 or tear no more than internal thickness 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.920
 handle wine cork diameter a little 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.250
 construction towers or screws 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.140
 paper clips without isolation 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.530
 steel wire diameter of 38 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.620
 millimeters and 13 millimeters near the subway 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.989
 ordinary electrical wire poor 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.960
 prophet in isolation with a diameter of 4 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.260
 millimeter and also the power supply unit on 12 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.450
 volt 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.760
 to drive our action engine 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.649
 and of course the wooden bar 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.960
 any size which will be 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.430
 serve us as the basis for buddy let's 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.170
 let's see what we need from 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.680
 tool pliers 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.159
 side cutters screwdriver to loopback or 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.510
 vernier caliper 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:12.190
 hacksaw or hacksaw blade 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.280
 to metal 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.390
 drill file on 1 and 4 as well as on 3 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.909
 and 8 millimeters hot melt glue gun 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.439
 screwdriver or drill well, and all sorts of stuff 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:26.990
 which you will see while watching 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.360
 video first thing let's get together 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.229
 solenoid we need this wine 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:36.180
 cork handle columbus and gall and canvas 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:38.800
 let's break the handle 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.110
 from the handle we need to cut off part with 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.170
 For this we use a hacksaw 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.170
 canvas 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.850
 now what about the Ryazan section of the handle 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.360
 the doors to them are 35 millimeters and cut them off 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.360
 hacksaw blade 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.100
 now trim the burrs with 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.930
 using a file 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:03.420
 the next step from the wine cork will do 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.420
 two disks 5 millimeters thick 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.310
 the center of each disk will make a hole 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.320
 diameter equal to our outer diameter 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.970
 pens my case is 7 millimeters with 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.970
 using glue glue our discs 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.250
 This is the basis of our 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.940
 solenoid so let's start winding 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:37.980
 coils take our copper wire 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.230
 Here in this place were the center I did 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.190
 small through hole to 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.900
 pass the wire let go literally 10 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.319
 centimeters we again need to order 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.060
 500 600 turns only in one of the 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:53.190
 parties no matter who you are clockwise or 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.440
 counter clockwise the main thing is that all 600 baht 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.690
 who were one way can be set 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.140
 chaotically that is, their firebox point 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:09.300
 catch 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:11.700
 and just take a hank and get down so 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.680
 here it shook its 500 centuries stand 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.830
 tried the coil of turns and not so it 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.290
 and it seemed easy to do it on a drill 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:23.130
 or small hole like there and 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:28.260
 I will miss the beauty coil top wrap 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.000
 electrical tape let's check our pillow 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.450
 on whether this is working 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.410
 was wrong and send tessellation to the ends 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:40.230
 wire to clean 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:45.780
 turn on the power supply into the outlet aperture 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:49.050
 insert a screwdriver and connect to the unit 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.940
 power magnet there will appear 

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.350
 it means our coil is working but with 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.590
 the coil we finished let's go to 

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:56.910
 piston manufacture take our bolt or 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.670
 nail and using 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.970
 hacksaw we press the cap and 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:06.240
 so dear friends I cut off my hat 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:09.180
 bolt and taking the opportunity immediately made 

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.490
 Here is such a propyl and as decor 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.970
 perpendicular to him drilled a hole 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:17.000
 1 mm diameter 4 millimeter now 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.230
 let 's make manufacturing rods 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:22.620
 consideration of the court we take the wire 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:23.250
 diameter 3 and 8 millimeters we need 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.210
 go and and 

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:30.330
 1 + 0 so she entered this keyway and 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.520
 make exactly the same hole 13 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.470
 requests came here together for by 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.740
 making here so here i am 1 plus well 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:42.420
 made holes will that hold on here 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:44.730
 with our piston and so dear friends 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.140
 proceed to the manufacture of a crank 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:48.720
 shaft for this we will use 

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:52.650
 steel wire diameter 3 and 8 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.900
 millimeters so want to note that the length 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.510
 our solenoid is 3 with 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.370
 half a centimeter i.e. working stroke 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:05.009
 piston shoot will make up 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:07.650
 about 20 millimeters so 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:10.020
 working knee on the amount of shaft needed 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.430
 will move away from the axis of rotation of the order 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:21.990
 one centimeter 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:24.449
 here we have such a side to 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.249
 counted in the role of the flywheel we will 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:28.289
 use a wheel with a toy car 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:30.469
 let's set it to the number 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.469
 shaft 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:43.589
 to connect the connecting rod number 

00:05:42.119 --> 00:05:46.259
 uvala we will use such here 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:48.899
 A simple device is a cap from 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:56.699
 pens i drilled holes 

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:59.969
 perpendicular to each other will 

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:03.509
 mounted on knee threaded 

00:05:59.969 --> 00:06:05.429
 in the crank mount the same crankshaft 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:08.729
 Based on this, we will 

00:06:05.429 --> 00:06:09.830
 for previously made but made them from 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.330
 wire 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.009
 14 millimeters and so installed it 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:16.080
 crankshaft with flywheel on 

00:06:14.009 --> 00:06:18.919
 basis for fixing used 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:22.069
 construction cover to 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.119
 the amount of the wave ran right-left 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:26.339
 used small shaybochki and 

00:06:24.119 --> 00:06:27.360
 literally silicone 

00:06:26.339 --> 00:06:29.399
 hot melt glue 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:31.589
 dog so small if you have such 

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:33.599
 no shaybochek you can cut them out 

00:06:31.589 --> 00:06:36.889
 tin can or cans 

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:38.789
 you can even use plastic 

00:06:36.889 --> 00:06:41.909
 rotating around its axis 

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:43.759
 continue the build without pieces of days 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:46.259
 life makes contact 

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:46.529
 bend a little at the tip cranked 

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:48.930
 shaft 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:51.899
 him so that a certain moment was 

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.789
 contact with six is ​​now set 

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:57.169
 the rod is salt 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:57.169
 try to run 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:19.100
 and 

00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:28.580
 turn on the power supply in the outlet and 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:30.910
 check our performance 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:30.910
 engine 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:42.580
 as you can see everything works wonderfully if 

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.229
 You can also use a capacitor 

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:46.440
 cure our rotation speed 

00:07:44.229 --> 00:07:46.440
 engine 

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.340
 thank you all for watching 

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:58.650
 try to do and you will succeed with 

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:01.700
 you were maxim my channel crazy sneakers 

00:07:58.650 --> 00:08:01.700
 all the best for now
