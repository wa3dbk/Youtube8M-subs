00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.250

 is always predisposed to help the 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:05.170
 so that was one of the things 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.800
 simplest that I had to live the 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.480
 adaptation was spectacular 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.760
 why did you decide to be a footballer 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.910
 and my old one old fans of 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.880
 football as a kid made me play 

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:22.510
 I lost a ball and obviously I liked it 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.760
 I really liked my friends 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.790
 we can on a daily basis so he made this 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:30.040
 Become a passion and you want 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.470
 live from something that I really love 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:34.909
 do 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.460
 the type of music you prefer 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.460
 I really like the national rum the rum 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.740
 my country 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.850
 famous band like the redonditos ricota 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.850
 these stereo 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.859
 very traditional music in argentina and 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.490
 then I like international rock 

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:53.490
 too much 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:59.710
 coldplay of all a little 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.050
 what is your dream as a footballer about 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.010
 the questions 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.320
 and my dream 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.619
 it starts with several dreams and many 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.540
 I have already fulfilled it then now I think 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.870
 what I would miss would be to play in the 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.450
 My country's selection is something that 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.430
 one dreams of a little boy and who fights for 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:22.940
 for trying to realize what one day 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.770
 I know that one is going to do everything possible 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.100
 what activity do you do in your time 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.140
 free 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.730
 I really like sharing time with 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.390
 with my family with my friends 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.549
 I like I have a dog that tries 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.459
 play with him also the free rats in 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.290
 such movies are various activity 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.730
 what I like to do beforehand 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:47.040
 sharing in a family 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.880
 what soccer player do you consider your 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.670
 idol 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.310
 and well we have 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.980
 an idol that has shown in the field 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:01.099
 game do wonderful things like the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.140
 diego diego maradona I think it's one of 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.060
 the biggest references that we have to 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.430
 our football now obviously we have 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.500
 to leo messi that does things 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.130
 wonderful on the court and then I 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.020
 I grew up in a time when I played very 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.030
 good mouth juniors and that there was 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:19.100
 players like samuel like as normal 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.300
 that the truth is that you do not tax me 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:25.540
 I consider them to be references 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:28.830
 because you use the number 24 was not a 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.020
 number that I liked I liked it 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.600
 I thought it was nice of you with that number 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:39.110
 and it shows my whole career then that's 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:42.740
 the reason why I use it sincerely 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.200
 is that a number that I like and what 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.990
 then he took what he considered 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.090
 as something that is part of my life 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.200
 soccer 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.959
 what was the best goal of your career 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.670
 the best goal louis in a classic lanús 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:59.890
 banfield in banfield court let's say 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.350
 we started losing match ties 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.300
 He commented that convert the 2 to 1 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.340
 there you live in a very special way 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.870
 is in a split class and have converted 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.390
 in this game and that has not given the 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:13.130
 triumph the truth that it was something beautiful and 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.380
 I lived it in a very pleasant way 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.000
 This is all so here we send a 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.160
 big greeting and I hope you have them 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.160
