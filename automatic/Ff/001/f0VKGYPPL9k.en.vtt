back<00:00:13.140> we're<00:00:13.470> looking<00:00:13.770> at<00:00:14.510> animal<00:00:15.510> kingdom

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:15.840 
back we're looking at animal kingdom

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.140 
back we're looking at animal kingdom
continued<00:00:16.380> this<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.740> viola<00:00:17.220> Mima<00:00:17.580> toda<00:00:17.790> so

continued this is viola Mima toda so

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.450 
continued this is viola Mima toda so
this<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.840> round<00:00:19.290> worms<00:00:19.560> these<00:00:20.250> are<00:00:20.369> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
this is the round worms these are the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.760 
this is the round worms these are the
nasty<00:00:20.790> little<00:00:20.910> ones<00:00:21.180> they<00:00:21.480> are

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:21.770 
nasty little ones they are

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:26.600 
nasty little ones they are
microscopically<00:00:22.850> scary<00:00:25.070> so<00:00:26.070> here's<00:00:26.279> just<00:00:26.369> an

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610 
microscopically scary so here's just an

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.519 
microscopically scary so here's just an
example<00:00:26.669> this<00:00:27.270> one's<00:00:27.540> not<00:00:27.720> that<00:00:27.779> scary<00:00:28.320> but

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
example this one's not that scary but

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.130 
example this one's not that scary but
it's<00:00:29.099> got<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.369> round<00:00:29.610> worm<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.419> structure

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
it's got that round worm like structure

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.620 
it's got that round worm like structure
but<00:00:31.740> let's<00:00:32.160> look<00:00:32.430> at<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.730> violin<00:00:33.360> level

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
but let's look at the violin level

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.240 
but let's look at the violin level
characteristics<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.560> you<00:00:34.650> can<00:00:34.860> pause<00:00:35.040> this

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
characteristics so you can pause this

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:36.740 
characteristics so you can pause this
one<00:00:35.460> jot<00:00:35.700> em<00:00:35.790> all<00:00:35.880> down<00:00:36.030> or<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.300> can<00:00:36.420> wait<00:00:36.570> till

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
one jot em all down or you can wait till

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.840 
one jot em all down or you can wait till
after<00:00:37.050> I<00:00:37.250> mention<00:00:38.250> them<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:38.489> then<00:00:38.579> write<00:00:38.730> them

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
after I mention them and then write them

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.580 
after I mention them and then write them
or<00:00:39.030> pause<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.420> write<00:00:39.510> it<00:00:39.600> down<00:00:39.690> then<00:00:39.900> so<00:00:40.500> these

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
or pause and write it down then so these

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.200 
or pause and write it down then so these
ones<00:00:40.829> a<00:00:41.040> big<00:00:41.190> difference<00:00:41.550> between<00:00:41.730> this<00:00:42.149> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
ones a big difference between this and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.729 
ones a big difference between this and
the<00:00:42.420> flat<00:00:42.629> worms<00:00:42.809> obviously<00:00:43.379> these<00:00:43.530> ones

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
the flat worms obviously these ones

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:47.029 
the flat worms obviously these ones
around<00:00:44.010> not<00:00:44.280> flat<00:00:44.899> it's<00:00:45.899> similar<00:00:46.440> again<00:00:46.829> no

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
around not flat it's similar again no

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.090 
around not flat it's similar again no
segmentation<00:00:47.989> lengthwise<00:00:48.989> muscle<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
segmentation lengthwise muscle that

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.549 
segmentation lengthwise muscle that
allows<00:00:50.340> them<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.789> move<00:00:51.000> like<00:00:51.269> a<00:00:51.300> snake<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:52.379> big

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
allows them to move like a snake the big

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.990 
allows them to move like a snake the big
difference<00:00:52.920> here<00:00:52.980> as<00:00:53.219> well<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.879> they

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
difference here as well is that they

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.459 
difference here as well is that they
have<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.120> complete<00:00:54.420> digestive<00:00:54.960> system<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.410> two

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
have a complete digestive system so two

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.349 
have a complete digestive system so two
openings<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.250> has<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.429> mouth<00:00:56.699> at<00:00:56.910> one<00:00:57.059> end<00:00:57.210> and

00:00:57.349 --> 00:00:57.359 
openings it has a mouth at one end and

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.959 
openings it has a mouth at one end and
the<00:00:57.449> anus<00:00:57.840> at<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.109> other<00:00:58.280> soft<00:00:59.280> buddy<00:00:59.640> same

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
the anus at the other soft buddy same

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.819 
the anus at the other soft buddy same
thing<00:01:00.210> hydrostatic<00:01:00.870> skeleton<00:01:00.989> keeps<00:01:01.589> its

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
thing hydrostatic skeleton keeps its

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.670 
thing hydrostatic skeleton keeps its
internal<00:01:02.399> structure<00:01:03.149> alive<00:01:03.960> due<00:01:04.230> to<00:01:04.410> the

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
internal structure alive due to the

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.310 
internal structure alive due to the
water<00:01:05.040> pressure<00:01:05.480> bilateral<00:01:06.480> symmetry<00:01:06.660> is

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
water pressure bilateral symmetry is

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.980 
water pressure bilateral symmetry is
similar<00:01:07.770> as<00:01:07.920> well<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.370> no<00:01:09.270> circulatory

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
similar as well and no circulatory

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.590 
similar as well and no circulatory
system<00:01:10.470> because<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.310> does<00:01:11.460> not<00:01:11.610> need<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.940> as

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
system because it does not need to as

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.810 
system because it does not need to as
well<00:01:12.870> it<00:01:13.110> diffuses<00:01:13.380> all<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.460> nutrients

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
well it diffuses all the nutrients

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.810 
well it diffuses all the nutrients
diffuse<00:01:15.299> through<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.869> body<00:01:16.460> okay<00:01:17.460> so<00:01:17.520> you<00:01:17.729> can

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
diffuse through the body okay so you can

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.910 
diffuse through the body okay so you can
pause<00:01:17.939> that<00:01:18.409> so<00:01:19.409> again<00:01:19.829> just<00:01:19.860> a<00:01:20.159> quick<00:01:20.369> little

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
pause that so again just a quick little

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.859 
pause that so again just a quick little
picture<00:01:22.920> of<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> structure<00:01:23.549> here<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.450> here's

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
picture of the structure here so here's

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.080 
picture of the structure here so here's
the<00:01:25.079> head<00:01:25.259> here's<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:26.009> anus<00:01:26.369> food<00:01:26.700> comes<00:01:26.939> in

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
the head here's the anus food comes in

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.050 
the head here's the anus food comes in
here<00:01:27.360> goes<00:01:27.659> out<00:01:27.840> there<00:01:28.110> as<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.610> can<00:01:29.729> see<00:01:29.850> here

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
here goes out there as we can see here

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.760 
here goes out there as we can see here
we<00:01:30.149> have<00:01:30.180> some<00:01:30.270> salad<00:01:30.570> salivary<00:01:31.259> glands<00:01:31.530> which

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
we have some salad salivary glands which

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.679 
we have some salad salivary glands which
helps<00:01:32.009> to<00:01:32.040> break<00:01:32.640> down<00:01:32.790> their<00:01:32.939> food<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.420> has

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
helps to break down their food it has

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:36.170 
helps to break down their food it has
its<00:01:33.930> intestine<00:01:34.710> which<00:01:35.610> is<00:01:35.759> different<00:01:36.119> than

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
its intestine which is different than

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.050 
its intestine which is different than
the<00:01:36.450> gastrovascular<00:01:36.899> cavity<00:01:37.850> ovaries<00:01:38.850> for

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
the gastrovascular cavity ovaries for

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.139 
the gastrovascular cavity ovaries for
reproduction<00:01:39.570> eggs<00:01:40.259> as<00:01:40.680> well<00:01:40.909> so<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:41.969> guys

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
reproduction eggs as well so you guys

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.120 
reproduction eggs as well so you guys
can<00:01:42.390> jot<00:01:42.719> that<00:01:42.899> one<00:01:43.140> down<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.680> we'll<00:01:43.799> see<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
can jot that one down but we'll see the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.810 
can jot that one down but we'll see the
structure<00:01:44.520> again<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.790> class<00:01:46.610> looking<00:01:47.610> at<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
structure again in class looking at a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.109 
structure again in class looking at a
cross-section<00:01:48.210> of<00:01:48.810> it<00:01:49.280> we<00:01:50.280> have<00:01:50.490> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
cross-section of it we have the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.700 
cross-section of it we have the
different<00:01:51.479> lay<00:01:51.570> layers<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:52.469> we<00:01:52.590> have<00:01:52.680> a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
different lay layers here we have a

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.529 
different lay layers here we have a
pseudo<00:01:53.130> column<00:01:53.640> so<00:01:53.789> it's<00:01:53.909> not<00:01:54.030> quite<00:01:54.270> an<00:01:54.390> a

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
pseudo column so it's not quite an a

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:55.910 
pseudo column so it's not quite an a
column<00:01:54.899> because<00:01:55.049> there's<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.289> little<00:01:55.680> bit<00:01:55.799> of

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
column because there's a little bit of

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.760 
column because there's a little bit of
space<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.219> between<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:57.659> inner<00:01:58.140> layer<00:01:58.439> here

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
space in between the inner layer here

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.020 
space in between the inner layer here
which<00:01:58.979> would<00:01:59.159> be<00:01:59.219> similar<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.880> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
which would be similar to the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.179 
which would be similar to the
gastrointestinal<00:02:00.649> cavity<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:02.009> flat

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
gastrointestinal cavity of the flat

so<00:02:06.840> no<00:02:07.140> flame<00:02:07.439> cells<00:02:08.000> uterus<00:02:09.000> ovaries<00:02:09.360> and

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
so no flame cells uterus ovaries and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.250 
so no flame cells uterus ovaries and
it's<00:02:10.590> also<00:02:10.710> got<00:02:10.950> a<00:02:11.009> nerve<00:02:11.520> cord<00:02:12.060> okay<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:12.960> we

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
it's also got a nerve cord okay so we

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.190 
it's also got a nerve cord okay so we
have<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.500> picture<00:02:13.710> that<00:02:13.830> in<00:02:14.040> your<00:02:14.130> notes<00:02:14.340> so

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
have a picture that in your notes so

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.300 
have a picture that in your notes so
let's<00:02:16.200> look<00:02:16.350> at<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.500> nervous<00:02:16.800> system<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:17.220> we

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
let's look at that nervous system so we

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.949 
let's look at that nervous system so we
still<00:02:17.550> have<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:17.880> cephalization<00:02:18.360> at<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
still have that cephalization at the

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.130 
still have that cephalization at the
head<00:02:19.140> we<00:02:20.069> have<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.519> several<00:02:21.360> ganglia<00:02:21.959> or

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.130 
nerve bundles it's again
it's<00:02:24.190> not<00:02:24.610> quite<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.880> real<00:02:25.120> brain<00:02:25.510> it's<00:02:25.870> just

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
it's not quite a real brain it's just

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.740 
it's not quite a real brain it's just

nervous tissues centralized at the head

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.200 
nervous tissues centralized at the head
they<00:02:29.080> have<00:02:29.290> sensory<00:02:29.800> organs<00:02:30.190> that<00:02:30.430> can<00:02:30.610> detect

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
they have sensory organs that can detect

it is able to move and it is snake-like

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.120 
it is able to move and it is snake-like
movement<00:02:49.780> okay<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:50.320> you<00:02:50.530> pause<00:02:50.709> that<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.040> get

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
movement okay so you pause that and get

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.230 
movement okay so you pause that and get

involve many hosts similar to that of
the<00:03:11.680> platyhelminthes<00:03:12.660> so<00:03:13.660> pause<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:14.110> and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
the platyhelminthes so pause that and

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.490 
the platyhelminthes so pause that and
get<00:03:14.350> that<00:03:14.380> down<00:03:15.570> some<00:03:16.570> diversity<00:03:17.080> which<00:03:17.290> means

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
get that down some diversity which means

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.470 
get that down some diversity which means
some<00:03:17.770> differences<00:03:18.400> between<00:03:18.580> them

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
some differences between them

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.840 
some differences between them

the organisms most or free-living found
in<00:03:22.180> all<00:03:22.480> habitats<00:03:23.020> and<00:03:23.230> they're<00:03:23.350> very

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
in all habitats and they're very

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.560 
in all habitats and they're very
successful<00:03:23.890> because<00:03:24.520> there's<00:03:24.760> lots<00:03:25.390> of

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:25.570 
successful because there's lots of

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.300 
successful because there's lots of

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
species and large numbers of them so

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:31.949 
species and large numbers of them so
here's<00:03:30.519> an<00:03:30.670> example<00:03:30.730> of<00:03:31.120> a<00:03:31.209> large<00:03:31.510> number<00:03:31.780> of

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
the free-living all of these big long

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.180 
the free-living all of these big long

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
worms living off other organisms so

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:39.660 
worms living off other organisms so
these<00:03:36.280> ones<00:03:36.459> are<00:03:36.580> not<00:03:36.700> parasitic<00:03:38.549> but<00:03:39.549> there

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
these ones are not parasitic but there

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.190 
these ones are not parasitic but there
are<00:03:39.820> some<00:03:40.060> parasitic<00:03:40.390> ones<00:03:40.720> and<00:03:40.959> they<00:03:41.170> are

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
are some parasitic ones and they are

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.800 
are some parasitic ones and they are
pretty<00:03:41.620> nasty<00:03:41.799> they<00:03:42.430> infect<00:03:42.880> a<00:03:43.060> lot<00:03:43.690> of

infects humans and it can be a nasty
nasty<00:03:49.390> little<00:03:49.690> guy<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:51.459> let's<00:03:51.640> look<00:03:51.760> at<00:03:51.910> a

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
nasty little guy so let's look at a

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.759 
nasty little guy so let's look at a
scariest<00:03:52.630> lifecycle<00:03:53.170> this<00:03:53.260> might<00:03:53.440> take<00:03:53.620> some

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
scariest lifecycle this might take some

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.170 
scariest lifecycle this might take some
time<00:03:53.799> so<00:03:53.980> you're<00:03:54.190> gonna<00:03:54.280> have<00:03:54.430> to<00:03:54.519> jot<00:03:55.030> this

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
time so you're gonna have to jot this

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.449 
time so you're gonna have to jot this

we're<00:04:23.800> going<00:04:23.919> to<00:04:24.010> see<00:04:24.100> some<00:04:24.280> more<00:04:24.400> scarce

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:24.760 
we're going to see some more scarce

we're going to see some more scarce
videos<00:04:25.090> in<00:04:25.240> class<00:04:25.450> we<00:04:25.720> won't<00:04:25.870> bother<00:04:25.990> showing

videos in class we won't bother showing
you<00:04:26.500> now<00:04:26.729> this<00:04:27.729> is<00:04:27.850> what<00:04:28.000> one<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.180> them<00:04:28.330> looks

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
you now this is what one of them looks

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.170 
you now this is what one of them looks
like<00:04:28.740> nasty<00:04:29.740> nasty<00:04:29.979> looking<00:04:30.430> guy<00:04:30.580> so<00:04:30.910> here's

like nasty nasty looking guy so here's

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.750 
like nasty nasty looking guy so here's
its<00:04:31.390> hooks<00:04:32.169> which<00:04:32.590> can<00:04:32.860> be<00:04:32.979> used<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.460> embed

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
its hooks which can be used to embed

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.480 
its hooks which can be used to embed
into<00:04:33.940> the<00:04:34.090> intestine<00:04:34.570> of<00:04:34.599> the<00:04:34.870> host<00:04:35.410> and<00:04:35.710> they

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
into the intestine of the host and they

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:37.679 
into the intestine of the host and they
tend<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:36.849> go<00:04:37.000> in<00:04:37.150> through<00:04:37.360> the<00:04:37.450> bear

00:04:37.679 --> 00:04:37.689 
tend to go in through the bear

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:40.259 
tend to go in through the bear
feet<00:04:37.989> okay<00:04:38.769> so<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:39.219> lot<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.639> them<00:04:39.849> happen<00:04:40.149> in

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:40.269 
feet okay so a lot of them happen in

00:04:40.269 --> 00:04:41.669 
feet okay so a lot of them happen in
third-world<00:04:40.509> countries<00:04:40.689> where<00:04:41.199> there's<00:04:41.529> no

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:41.679 
third-world countries where there's no

00:04:41.679 --> 00:04:44.779 
third-world countries where there's no
shoes<00:04:41.979> and<00:04:42.659> yeah<00:04:43.659> it's<00:04:43.839> a<00:04:43.899> nasty<00:04:44.049> little<00:04:44.319> thing

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
shoes and yeah it's a nasty little thing

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.559 
shoes and yeah it's a nasty little thing
another<00:04:45.789> example<00:04:46.299> of<00:04:46.389> a<00:04:47.039> scariest<00:04:48.569> parasite

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:49.569 
another example of a scariest parasite

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.499 
another example of a scariest parasite
in<00:04:49.749> the<00:04:49.779> foot<00:04:50.319> of<00:04:50.469> a<00:04:50.529> human<00:04:50.829> and<00:04:51.179> so<00:04:52.179> let's<00:04:52.360> look

00:04:52.499 --> 00:04:52.509 
in the foot of a human and so let's look

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.989 
in the foot of a human and so let's look
at<00:04:52.629> a<00:04:52.659> hookworm<00:04:52.919> lifecycle<00:04:53.919> similar<00:04:54.759> to<00:04:54.879> that

00:04:54.989 --> 00:04:54.999 
at a hookworm lifecycle similar to that

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:56.729 
at a hookworm lifecycle similar to that
of<00:04:55.059> the<00:04:55.209> scarus<00:04:55.719> the<00:04:55.869> hookworm<00:04:56.049> eggs<00:04:56.469> hatch

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:56.739 
of the scarus the hookworm eggs hatch

00:04:56.739 --> 00:04:58.350 
of the scarus the hookworm eggs hatch
and<00:04:56.889> develop<00:04:57.249> in<00:04:57.339> the<00:04:57.399> soil<00:04:57.610> they<00:04:58.089> use<00:04:58.209> the

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 
and develop in the soil they use the

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.269 
and develop in the soil they use the
sharp<00:04:58.569> teeth<00:04:58.809> to<00:04:59.019> break<00:04:59.199> into<00:04:59.409> the<00:04:59.559> feet<00:04:59.769> the

00:05:00.269 --> 00:05:00.279 
sharp teeth to break into the feet the

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.069 
sharp teeth to break into the feet the
Quintero<00:05:00.639> burrowing<00:05:01.209> until<00:05:01.629> they<00:05:01.779> have<00:05:01.929> hit

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:02.079 
Quintero burrowing until they have hit

00:05:02.079 --> 00:05:04.350 
Quintero burrowing until they have hit
that<00:05:02.259> bloodstream<00:05:02.889> travellin<00:05:03.549> lungs<00:05:03.759> coughed

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
that bloodstream travellin lungs coughed

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.729 
that bloodstream travellin lungs coughed
up<00:05:04.569> and<00:05:04.809> swallowed<00:05:05.110> to<00:05:05.199> eventually<00:05:05.529> read<00:05:05.619> the

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:05.739 
up and swallowed to eventually read the

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:07.889 
up and swallowed to eventually read the
intestines<00:05:06.279> and<00:05:06.399> then<00:05:06.849> adult<00:05:07.179> worms<00:05:07.360> dig<00:05:07.719> into

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:07.899 
intestines and then adult worms dig into

00:05:07.899 --> 00:05:09.749 
intestines and then adult worms dig into
the<00:05:08.079> intestine<00:05:08.499> wall<00:05:08.739> and<00:05:08.979> suck<00:05:09.189> off<00:05:09.369> the<00:05:09.519> body

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:09.759 
the intestine wall and suck off the body

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.269 
the intestine wall and suck off the body
of<00:05:09.909> the<00:05:10.119> suck<00:05:10.629> the<00:05:10.779> blood<00:05:10.869> of<00:05:10.989> the<00:05:11.229> host<00:05:11.439> so

00:05:12.269 --> 00:05:12.279 
of the suck the blood of the host so

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:16.859 
of the suck the blood of the host so
bloodsuckers<00:05:14.819> here's<00:05:15.819> just<00:05:16.029> another<00:05:16.119> just

00:05:16.859 --> 00:05:16.869 
bloodsuckers here's just another just

00:05:16.869 --> 00:05:18.869 
bloodsuckers here's just another just
visual<00:05:17.289> you<00:05:17.559> guys<00:05:17.739> can<00:05:17.949> pause<00:05:18.189> this<00:05:18.429> one<00:05:18.669> and

00:05:18.869 --> 00:05:18.879 
visual you guys can pause this one and

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:19.979 
visual you guys can pause this one and
look<00:05:19.209> at<00:05:19.329> it<00:05:19.419> but<00:05:19.509> you<00:05:19.569> don't<00:05:19.719> have<00:05:19.779> to<00:05:19.869> write

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:19.989 
look at it but you don't have to write

00:05:19.989 --> 00:05:21.209 
look at it but you don't have to write
it<00:05:20.079> down<00:05:20.169> because<00:05:20.259> we<00:05:20.379> pretty<00:05:20.679> much<00:05:20.739> just<00:05:20.860> said

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
it down because we pretty much just said

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:26.999 
it down because we pretty much just said
it<00:05:23.999> here's<00:05:24.999> another<00:05:25.269> of<00:05:25.539> the<00:05:25.839> hook<00:05:26.110> worms<00:05:26.349> and

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
it here's another of the hook worms and

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:29.299 
it here's another of the hook worms and
this<00:05:27.759> is<00:05:27.879> what<00:05:28.029> the<00:05:28.119> hookworm<00:05:28.300> looks<00:05:28.779> like<00:05:28.989> a

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:29.309 
this is what the hookworm looks like a

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:33.299 
this is what the hookworm looks like a
few<00:05:30.309> different<00:05:30.399> types<00:05:30.699> they're<00:05:31.079> nasty<00:05:32.079> and<00:05:32.309> I

00:05:33.299 --> 00:05:33.309 
few different types they're nasty and I

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:34.739 
few different types they're nasty and I
just<00:05:33.489> put<00:05:33.610> this<00:05:33.729> video<00:05:33.879> to<00:05:34.059> visual<00:05:34.449> up<00:05:34.569> because

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:34.749 
just put this video to visual up because

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:37.889 
just put this video to visual up because
I<00:05:34.809> thought<00:05:34.959> it<00:05:35.079> looked<00:05:35.169> very<00:05:35.409> cool<00:05:36.899> filarial

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:37.899 
I thought it looked very cool filarial

00:05:37.899 --> 00:05:40.729 
I thought it looked very cool filarial
worms<00:05:38.589> these<00:05:38.949> ones<00:05:39.189> cause<00:05:39.489> the<00:05:39.699> elephantitis

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:40.739 
worms these ones cause the elephantitis
