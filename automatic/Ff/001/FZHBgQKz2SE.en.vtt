00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
this way um

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.640 
this way um
with<00:03:40.150> the<00:03:40.269> shorts<00:03:40.689> they're<00:03:40.989> not<00:03:41.140> exactly<00:03:41.560> the

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
with the shorts they're not exactly the

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.740 
with the shorts they're not exactly the
shortest<00:03:42.280> parrot<00:03:42.549> right<00:03:42.700> or<00:03:42.939> the<00:03:43.060> longest<00:03:43.540> so

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
shortest parrot right or the longest so

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.250 
shortest parrot right or the longest so
it's<00:03:44.349> not<00:03:44.799> like<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.970> usual<00:03:46.329> kind<00:03:46.510> of<00:03:46.659> link

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260

it's not like the usual kind of link
which<00:03:47.799> is<00:03:47.829> why<00:03:48.069> it<00:03:48.189> shows<00:03:48.400> this<00:03:48.730> not<00:03:49.209> front<00:03:49.629> pop

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
which is why it shows this not front pop

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.170 
which is why it shows this not front pop
um<00:03:50.560> it<00:03:50.769> sort<00:03:50.920> of<00:03:51.040> gives<00:03:51.220> it<00:03:51.430> enough<00:03:51.790> skin<00:03:52.060> to

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180
