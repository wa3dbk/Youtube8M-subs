scenes they added especially this stuff

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:26.390

with<00:00:23.820> Cavuto<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.869> song<00:00:25.080> itself<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.710> really

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
with Cavuto the song itself I really

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.710 
with Cavuto the song itself I really
don't<00:00:26.519> care<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:26.970> it<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.150> just<00:00:27.269> not<00:00:27.480> really

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
don't care for it it's just not really

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.540 
don't care for it it's just not really
for<00:00:27.900> me<00:00:28.050> but<00:00:28.320> maybe<00:00:28.800> I<00:00:28.920> just<00:00:29.160> have<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.310> listen

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
for me but maybe I just have to listen

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.130 
for me but maybe I just have to listen
to<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.880> a<00:00:29.939> few<00:00:29.970> more<00:00:30.269> times<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.720> see<00:00:30.900> how<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
to it a few more times to see how it

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.749 
to it a few more times to see how it
really<00:00:31.289> goes<00:00:31.410> along<00:00:31.949> with<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> imagery<00:00:32.610> but

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
really goes along with the imagery but

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.370 
really goes along with the imagery but
for<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.090> most<00:00:33.300> part<00:00:33.420> I<00:00:33.690> feel<00:00:33.750> like<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.170> song

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
for the most part I feel like the song

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.959 
for the most part I feel like the song
doesn't<00:00:34.649> really<00:00:34.890> work<00:00:35.160> with<00:00:35.309> what's<00:00:35.550> going<00:00:35.820> on

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
doesn't really work with what's going on

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.389 
doesn't really work with what's going on
with<00:00:36.149> what<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.450> see<00:00:36.690> but<00:00:37.500> there<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.340> i

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
with what you see but there it is i

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.619 
with what you see but there it is i
still<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.969> listen<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.450> few<00:00:39.480> times

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
still have to listen to it a few times

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.180

aren't<00:01:12.360> affecting<00:01:12.750> mudarra<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.320> much<00:01:13.560> but

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
aren't affecting mudarra that much but

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.620 
aren't affecting mudarra that much but
here's<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.549> thing<00:01:14.670> when<00:01:15.030> I<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.240> reading<00:01:15.420> all

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
here's the thing when I was reading all

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.630 
here's the thing when I was reading all
of<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.290> manga<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.890> didn't<00:01:17.490> really

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
of this in the manga I didn't really

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.609 
of this in the manga I didn't really
care<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.270> smugness<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.990> mudarra<00:01:19.350> here

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
care for the smugness of mudarra here

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.140 
care for the smugness of mudarra here
but<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.040> know<00:01:20.159> now<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:20.670> actually<00:01:20.850> get<00:01:21.090> to

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
but you know now that I actually get to
