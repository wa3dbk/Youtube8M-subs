00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.060 
reflexivity and lightning fast reaction

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.070 
reflexivity and lightning fast reaction
response<00:04:35.479> basically<00:04:35.870> it<00:04:36.470> makes<00:04:36.680> games<00:04:36.979> better

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
response basically it makes games better

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.110 
response basically it makes games better
it<00:04:39.080> incorporates<00:04:39.650> a<00:04:39.770> dual<00:04:39.979> axis<00:04:40.430> angular<00:04:40.940> rate

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
it incorporates a dual axis angular rate

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.059 
it incorporates a dual axis angular rate
sensor<00:04:41.599> which<00:04:41.780> can<00:04:41.960> determine<00:04:42.440> rotational

00:04:43.059 --> 00:04:43.069 
sensor which can determine rotational

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:44.860 
sensor which can determine rotational
motion<00:04:43.460> basically<00:04:44.210> it<00:04:44.300> means<00:04:44.330> you<00:04:44.629> can<00:04:44.780> do

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
motion basically it means you can do

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.200 
motion basically it means you can do
this<00:04:45.139> as<00:04:45.440> well<00:04:45.949> as<00:04:46.099> this<00:04:46.340> it's<00:04:47.090> good<00:04:49.210> the

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210
