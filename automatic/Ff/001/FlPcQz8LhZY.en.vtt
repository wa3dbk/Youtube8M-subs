3-inch just over three inch blade one of
the<00:00:42.329> reasons<00:00:42.600> that<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.750> really<00:00:43.140> wanted<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.500> pick

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
the reasons that I really wanted to pick

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.010 
the reasons that I really wanted to pick
this<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.550> what<00:00:44.640> kind<00:00:44.850> of<00:00:44.969> drew<00:00:45.660> me<00:00:45.809> to<00:00:45.989> it

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
this up and what kind of drew me to it

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.590 
this up and what kind of drew me to it
is<00:00:46.260> that<00:00:46.739> it's<00:00:46.890> very<00:00:47.100> similar<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.969> comas

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
is that it's very similar to a comas

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.290 
is that it's very similar to a comas
actual<00:00:49.350> custom<00:00:49.860> knives

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
actual custom knives

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.400 
actual custom knives
design-wise<00:00:53.300> everything<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.840> looks<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.260> lot

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
design-wise everything it looks a lot

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.200 
design-wise everything it looks a lot
like<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.829> of<00:00:55.920> course<00:00:56.100> his<00:00:56.399> flippers<00:00:57.000> feature

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
like it of course his flippers feature

fit and finish things and a few extra
features<00:01:03.719> many<00:01:04.049> differences<00:01:04.350> materials<00:01:04.890> yeah

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
features many differences materials yeah

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.390 
features many differences materials yeah
this<00:01:05.489> is<00:01:05.640> aluminum<00:01:06.360> scales<00:01:07.189> his<00:01:08.189> would

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
this is aluminum scales his would

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.730 
this is aluminum scales his would
feature<00:01:08.549> titanium<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.450> of<00:01:09.780> course<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> blade

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
feature titanium and of course the blade

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.219 
feature titanium and of course the blade
steel<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.130> think<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.790> I<00:01:12.030> don't<00:01:12.990> want<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
steel I think this is I don't want to

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.380 
steel I think this is I don't want to
misspeak<00:01:13.439> but<00:01:13.830> I<00:01:13.860> think<00:01:14.280> it's<00:01:14.400> offset<00:01:14.880> on<00:01:15.150> this

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
misspeak but I think it's offset on this

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.230 
misspeak but I think it's offset on this

just<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.509> little<00:01:18.659> first<00:01:19.080> impressions<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.950> this

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250

just a little first impressions of this
blade<00:01:20.540> first<00:01:21.540> off<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.820> actually<00:01:23.820> really<00:01:24.240> dig

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
blade first off I actually really dig

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.679 
blade first off I actually really dig
the<00:01:24.570> size<00:01:25.100> it<00:01:26.100> feels<00:01:26.340> really<00:01:26.580> good<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.270> my<00:01:27.450> hand

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
the size it feels really good in my hand

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.030 
the size it feels really good in my hand
when<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:27.900> picked<00:01:28.170> this<00:01:28.259> up<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.680> feels<00:01:28.799> great

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
when I picked this up it feels great

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.700 
when I picked this up it feels great
actually<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:30.119> nice<00:01:30.570> hollow<00:01:30.869> ground<00:01:31.140> blade<00:01:31.290> you

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
actually a nice hollow ground blade you

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.870 
actually a nice hollow ground blade you
can<00:01:31.829> tell<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.250> this<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.400> going<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.640> be<00:01:32.729> just

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
can tell that this is going to be just

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.160 
can tell that this is going to be just
an<00:01:33.000> excellent<00:01:33.390> excellent<00:01:33.869> slicer<00:01:36.170> the

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
an excellent excellent slicer the

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.210 
an excellent excellent slicer the
bearing<00:01:37.530> system<00:01:38.420> feels<00:01:39.420> pretty<00:01:39.659> good<00:01:40.220> you

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
bearing system feels pretty good you

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.899 
bearing system feels pretty good you
know<00:01:41.250> I<00:01:41.610> don't<00:01:42.329> know<00:01:42.420> if<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:42.630> quite<00:01:42.750> executed

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
know I don't know if it's quite executed

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.350 
know I don't know if it's quite executed
all<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.270> great<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.810> warrant<00:01:46.229> having<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.430> you

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
all that great to warrant having it you

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.120 
all that great to warrant having it you
know<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.479> think<00:01:48.869> that<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.590> level<00:01:49.920> of

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
know I think that this level of

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.460 
know I think that this level of
smoothness<00:01:50.630> could<00:01:51.630> have<00:01:51.720> been<00:01:51.840> achieved<00:01:52.229> with

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
smoothness could have been achieved with

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.310 
smoothness could have been achieved with
just<00:01:52.710> washers<00:01:53.130> but<00:01:53.850> we'll<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.299> as<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.930> use<00:01:55.170> it

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
just washers but we'll see as I use it

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.700 
just washers but we'll see as I use it
more<00:01:55.579> we'll<00:01:56.579> see<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:56.909> it<00:01:57.090> kind<00:01:57.270> of<00:01:57.710> becomes

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
more we'll see if it kind of becomes

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.500 
more we'll see if it kind of becomes
more<00:01:59.070> apparent<00:02:00.380> using<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.500> ikbs<00:02:02.159> system

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:04.510 
more apparent using the ikbs system

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.610 
more apparent using the ikbs system
as<00:02:05.510> you<00:02:05.630> can<00:02:05.720> see<00:02:05.840> it<00:02:05.930> centered<00:02:06.320> I'll<00:02:06.440> talk

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
as you can see it centered I'll talk

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:07.870 
as you can see it centered I'll talk
about<00:02:06.650> that<00:02:06.950> here<00:02:07.160> in<00:02:07.220> a<00:02:07.310> second<00:02:07.670> there's<00:02:07.820> a

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
about that here in a second there's a

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.030 
about that here in a second there's a
quite<00:02:08.360> a<00:02:08.390> disappointment<00:02:08.660> with<00:02:09.380> this<00:02:09.619> knife<00:02:09.860> I

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
quite a disappointment with this knife I

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.800 
quite a disappointment with this knife I
can<00:02:10.100> tell<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:10.460> about<00:02:10.520> it's<00:02:11.120> like<00:02:11.240> a<00:02:11.270> plastic

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
can tell you about it's like a plastic

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:13.600 
can tell you about it's like a plastic
backspace<00:02:12.770> or<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.070> very<00:02:13.340> light<00:02:13.580> very

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
backspace or a very light very

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.420 
backspace or a very light very
lightweight<00:02:14.180> this<00:02:15.080> aluminum<00:02:15.590> obviously

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
lightweight this aluminum obviously

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.920 
lightweight this aluminum obviously
aluminum<00:02:16.880> is<00:02:16.970> really<00:02:17.300> white<00:02:17.450> late

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
aluminum is really white late

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.620 
aluminum is really white late
white<00:02:18.350> late<00:02:18.650> light<00:02:19.490> weight<00:02:19.730> even<00:02:20.300> more<00:02:20.450> so

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
white late light weight even more so

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.600 
white late light weight even more so
than<00:02:20.810> titanium<00:02:21.140> and<00:02:21.530> it<00:02:22.010> has<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.190> bunch<00:02:22.460> of

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
than titanium and it has a bunch of

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.320 
than titanium and it has a bunch of
milling<00:02:23.620> done<00:02:24.620> on<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.950> it<00:02:25.580> says<00:02:25.940> that<00:02:26.180> it's

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
milling done on it it says that it's

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.920 
milling done on it it says that it's
anodized<00:02:27.730> so<00:02:28.730> I'll<00:02:28.850> have<00:02:28.970> to<00:02:29.090> just<00:02:29.240> go<00:02:29.420> off<00:02:29.690> of

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
anodized so I'll have to just go off of

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.790 
anodized so I'll have to just go off of
that<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.500> looks<00:02:30.740> more<00:02:30.890> like<00:02:31.040> paint<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.760> me<00:02:31.940> but

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
that it looks more like paint to me but

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.140 
that it looks more like paint to me but
in<00:02:33.800> fact<00:02:34.010> yeah<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.250> looks<00:02:34.430> it's<00:02:34.730> paint

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
in fact yeah it looks it's paint

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.310 
in fact yeah it looks it's paint
it's<00:02:35.330> got<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.570> be<00:02:35.630> pain<00:02:35.840> it's<00:02:35.990> kind<00:02:36.140> of<00:02:36.170> got<00:02:36.290> a

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
it's got to be pain it's kind of got a

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.900 
it's got to be pain it's kind of got a
semi-gloss<00:02:36.830> look<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.400> it<00:02:37.520> so<00:02:37.700> it's<00:02:37.820> not

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
semi-gloss look to it so it's not

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.900 
semi-gloss look to it so it's not
anodized<00:02:38.630> but<00:02:39.190> so<00:02:40.190> it's<00:02:40.310> painted<00:02:40.730> to<00:02:40.880> look

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
anodized but so it's painted to look

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.420 
anodized but so it's painted to look
like<00:02:41.150> his<00:02:42.050> custom<00:02:44.320> anodized<00:02:45.320> titanium<00:02:45.680> what

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
like his custom anodized titanium what

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:48.520 
like his custom anodized titanium what
flipper<00:02:46.850> works<00:02:47.180> awesome<00:02:47.450> they<00:02:48.170> did<00:02:48.380> the

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
flipper works awesome they did the

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.270 
flipper works awesome they did the
detent<00:02:49.010> nice<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:49.430> strong<00:02:49.900> flips<00:02:50.900> open<00:02:51.280> really

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
detent nice and strong flips open really

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.140 
detent nice and strong flips open really
really<00:02:52.640> nice

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
really nice

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.210 
really nice
of<00:02:53.450> course<00:02:53.690> the<00:02:53.810> flipper<00:02:54.170> also<00:02:54.470> acts<00:02:54.740> as<00:02:54.980> kind

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
of course the flipper also acts as kind

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.250 
of course the flipper also acts as kind
of<00:02:55.250> a<00:02:55.370> safety<00:02:55.790> mechanism<00:02:56.270> in<00:02:56.690> case<00:02:56.840> it<00:02:57.020> were<00:02:57.110> to

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:57.260 
of a safety mechanism in case it were to

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.100 
of a safety mechanism in case it were to
close<00:02:57.709> on<00:02:57.980> yeah<00:02:58.160> this<00:02:58.670> is<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:58.900> liner<00:02:59.900> lock

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
close on yeah this is a liner lock

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.600 
close on yeah this is a liner lock
construction<00:03:00.740> as<00:03:00.860> you<00:03:00.950> can<00:03:01.070> see<00:03:01.250> it's<00:03:01.400> kind<00:03:01.580> of

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
construction as you can see it's kind of

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.900 
construction as you can see it's kind of
a<00:03:01.730> nested<00:03:02.209> and<00:03:03.200> obviously<00:03:03.650> being<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.760> it's

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
a nested and obviously being that it's

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.590 
a nested and obviously being that it's
solid<00:03:05.540> aluminum<00:03:06.260> scales<00:03:06.709> there<00:03:07.070> the<00:03:07.970> liners

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:08.600 
solid aluminum scales there the liners

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.000 
solid aluminum scales there the liners
actually<00:03:08.959> want<00:03:09.080> to<00:03:09.170> go<00:03:09.230> down<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.560> about<00:03:09.620> here

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
actually want to go down to about here

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.640 
actually want to go down to about here
inside<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:10.730> it's<00:03:10.850> kind<00:03:11.060> of<00:03:11.150> a<00:03:11.470> nested<00:03:12.470> inside

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.650 
inside so it's kind of a nested inside

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.390 
inside so it's kind of a nested inside
there<00:03:13.570> nice<00:03:14.570> early<00:03:14.840> lock<00:03:15.170> up<00:03:15.440> rock-solid<00:03:15.980> up

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
there nice early lock up rock-solid up

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.970 
there nice early lock up rock-solid up
and<00:03:16.580> down<00:03:16.760> like<00:03:17.360> perfect<00:03:18.380> beautifully

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
and down like perfect beautifully

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.410 
and down like perfect beautifully
executed<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:20.390> only<00:03:20.690> issue<00:03:21.200> I<00:03:21.410> have<00:03:21.739> with<00:03:21.769> this

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
executed the only issue I have with this

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.150 
executed the only issue I have with this
is<00:03:23.420> side<00:03:23.690> to<00:03:23.840> side<00:03:24.050> has<00:03:24.800> a<00:03:24.830> lot<00:03:25.130> of

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
is side to side has a lot of

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.650 
is side to side has a lot of
side-to-side<00:03:25.640> play<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.390> mean<00:03:27.380> as<00:03:27.530> you<00:03:27.590> can<00:03:27.769> see

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
side-to-side play I mean as you can see

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.759 
side-to-side play I mean as you can see
it<00:03:29.660> just<00:03:29.690> and<00:03:30.940> it<00:03:31.940> feels<00:03:32.209> I<00:03:32.570> don't<00:03:33.410> know<00:03:33.500> it's

00:03:33.759 --> 00:03:33.769 
it just and it feels I don't know it's

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:36.250 
it just and it feels I don't know it's
it's<00:03:34.070> got<00:03:34.430> to<00:03:34.580> be<00:03:34.670> due<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.239> the<00:03:35.420> bearing<00:03:35.810> system

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:36.260 
it's got to be due to the bearing system

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.620 
it's got to be due to the bearing system
I'm<00:03:36.380> sure<00:03:36.590> I'll<00:03:36.709> take<00:03:36.920> this<00:03:37.100> apart<00:03:37.630> I'm

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:38.630 
I'm sure I'll take this apart I'm

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.210 
I'm sure I'll take this apart I'm
curious<00:03:38.989> to<00:03:39.170> see<00:03:39.200> how<00:03:39.380> they<00:03:39.620> did<00:03:39.680> that<00:03:39.920> bearing

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
curious to see how they did that bearing

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:44.259 
curious to see how they did that bearing
system<00:03:40.610> but<00:03:41.600> yeah<00:03:41.780> I<00:03:41.810> mean<00:03:42.760> you<00:03:43.760> can<00:03:43.910> see<00:03:44.120> how

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
system but yeah I mean you can see how

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.720 
system but yeah I mean you can see how
much<00:03:44.420> the<00:03:44.660> blade<00:03:44.930> just<00:03:44.959> Wiggles<00:03:45.560> around<00:03:45.620> and<00:03:46.160> I

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
much the blade just Wiggles around and I

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.520 
much the blade just Wiggles around and I
try<00:03:46.910> to<00:03:46.970> tighten<00:03:47.209> it<00:03:47.450> if<00:03:47.660> you<00:03:47.840> tighten<00:03:48.080> it<00:03:48.320> it

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
try to tighten it if you tighten it it

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.039 
try to tighten it if you tighten it it
pushes<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.220> blade<00:03:49.549> all<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.060> way<00:03:50.330> over<00:03:50.660> to

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
pushes the blade all the way over to

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.530 
pushes the blade all the way over to
push<00:03:51.260> the<00:03:51.470> liner<00:03:51.709> if<00:03:52.610> you<00:03:52.790> loosen<00:03:53.180> it<00:03:53.269> too<00:03:53.390> much

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:53.540 
push the liner if you loosen it too much

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.990 
push the liner if you loosen it too much
it<00:03:53.750> goes<00:03:53.900> this<00:03:54.170> way<00:03:54.250> if<00:03:55.250> you<00:03:55.459> tighten<00:03:55.700> it<00:03:55.880> too

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
it goes this way if you tighten it too

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.360 
it goes this way if you tighten it too
much<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.390> goes<00:03:56.540> too<00:03:56.720> far<00:03:56.930> this<00:03:57.110> way<00:03:57.170> so<00:03:58.070> in

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
much it goes too far this way so in

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:01.900 
much it goes too far this way so in
order<00:03:58.489> to<00:03:58.640> have<00:03:58.850> that<00:03:59.170> centered<00:04:00.519> this<00:04:01.519> is<00:04:01.730> as

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
order to have that centered this is as

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:04.300 
order to have that centered this is as
loose<00:04:02.150> as<00:04:02.330> it<00:04:02.510> needs<00:04:02.720> to<00:04:02.900> be<00:04:03.170> and

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
loose as it needs to be and

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.490 
loose as it needs to be and
it's<00:04:04.910> got<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.090> lot<00:04:05.330> of<00:04:05.360> lay<00:04:05.630> plays<00:04:05.930> keep<00:04:06.260> that<00:04:06.440> in

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
it's got a lot of lay plays keep that in

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.480 
it's got a lot of lay plays keep that in

how they did the ikbs on here I've
always<00:04:32.510> wondered<00:04:32.750> that<00:04:33.050> if<00:04:33.380> it's<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:33.830> same<00:04:34.160> as

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
always wondered that if it's the same as

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.260 
always wondered that if it's the same as
customs<00:04:35.270> because<00:04:35.690> I<00:04:35.720> have<00:04:36.410> a<00:04:36.440> custom<00:04:37.280> knife

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
customs because I have a custom knife

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.340 
customs because I have a custom knife
that<00:04:38.540> has<00:04:38.660> ikbs

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 
and I'm one and I've taken it apart and

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.680 
and I'm one and I've taken it apart and
I'm<00:04:41.540> wondering<00:04:41.690> if<00:04:43.120> there's<00:04:44.120> any<00:04:44.360> difference

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:44.690 
I'm wondering if there's any difference

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.160 
I'm wondering if there's any difference
between<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:46.280> two<00:04:46.510> and<00:04:47.510> I'm<00:04:47.690> also<00:04:47.840> kind<00:04:48.110> of

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
between the two and I'm also kind of

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.170 
between the two and I'm also kind of
wondering<00:04:48.530> if<00:04:48.800> I<00:04:49.250> could<00:04:49.550> put<00:04:49.700> washers<00:04:50.030> in

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
wondering if I could put washers in

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:53.290 
wondering if I could put washers in
instead<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:51.590> that<00:04:52.160> might<00:04:52.400> fix<00:04:52.730> the<00:04:52.940> centering

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
instead and that might fix the centering

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.690 
instead and that might fix the centering

review<00:05:24.140> on<00:05:24.320> this<00:05:24.470> we'll<00:05:24.650> see<00:05:24.800> how<00:05:25.390> how<00:05:26.390> it<00:05:26.510> goes

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
review on this we'll see how how it goes

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.680 
review on this we'll see how how it goes
but<00:05:27.370> yeah<00:05:28.370> it's<00:05:28.550> a<00:05:28.610> cool<00:05:28.729> little<00:05:28.910> knife<00:05:29.150> price

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
but yeah it's a cool little knife price

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.130 
but yeah it's a cool little knife price
on<00:05:29.840> this<00:05:29.960> is<00:05:30.110> about<00:05:30.350> 60<00:05:30.979> bucks

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:32.140 
on this is about 60 bucks

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.840 
on this is about 60 bucks
you<00:05:33.140> know<00:05:33.290> once<00:05:33.530> again<00:05:33.680> I<00:05:34.100> think<00:05:34.340> this<00:05:34.610> could

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
you know once again I think this could

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.090 
you know once again I think this could
have<00:05:34.940> worked<00:05:35.540> just<00:05:35.750> as<00:05:35.960> well<00:05:36.140> without<00:05:36.410> ikbs

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:37.100 
have worked just as well without ikbs

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.860 
have worked just as well without ikbs
and<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.640> price<00:05:37.880> point<00:05:38.150> maybe<00:05:38.419> could<00:05:38.810> have

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:38.870 
and the price point maybe could have

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:40.630 
and the price point maybe could have
been<00:05:38.930> lower<00:05:39.169> back<00:05:39.950> I'm<00:05:40.100> sure<00:05:40.280> it<00:05:40.370> would<00:05:40.550> be

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:40.640 
been lower back I'm sure it would be

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:41.770 
been lower back I'm sure it would be
probably<00:05:40.970> being<00:05:41.180> about<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.390> forty<00:05:41.660> dollar

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:41.780 
probably being about a forty dollar

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.280 
probably being about a forty dollar

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:45.290 
knife without the IQ yes but it does

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:47.830 
knife without the IQ yes but it does
flip<00:05:45.500> very<00:05:45.860> very<00:05:46.070> nicely<00:05:46.450> love<00:05:47.450> that<00:05:47.630> blade

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:47.840 
flip very very nicely love that blade

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.690 
flip very very nicely love that blade
shape<00:05:48.910> what<00:05:49.910> a<00:05:49.940> useful<00:05:50.240> blade<00:05:50.600> shape<00:05:50.750> that<00:05:50.990> is

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
shape what a useful blade shape that is

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:56.250 
shape what a useful blade shape that is
very<00:05:52.700> cool<00:05:52.970> I<00:05:53.210> also<00:05:53.630> like<00:05:53.930> a<00:05:54.290> comas<00:05:55.240> signature

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:56.260 
very cool I also like a comas signature

00:05:56.260 --> 00:05:59.590 
very cool I also like a comas signature
kind<00:05:57.260> of<00:05:57.380> uh<00:05:57.410> can't<00:05:58.370> really<00:05:58.550> use<00:05:58.790> that<00:05:58.820> to<00:05:59.180> open

00:05:59.590 --> 00:05:59.600 
kind of uh can't really use that to open

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:02.590 
kind of uh can't really use that to open
it<00:05:59.919> can't<00:06:00.919> get<00:06:01.430> in<00:06:01.490> there<00:06:01.790> good<00:06:02.000> enough<00:06:02.300> but

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600
