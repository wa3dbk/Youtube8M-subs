00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 
turns into a thick paste and that's it

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.040 
turns into a thick paste and that's it
now<00:03:20.150> the<00:03:20.209> other<00:03:20.360> thing<00:03:20.450> that<00:03:20.660> you<00:03:20.780> need<00:03:20.989> to

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:21.050 
now the other thing that you need to

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.690 
now the other thing that you need to
know<00:03:21.170> is<00:03:21.320> that<00:03:21.350> will<00:03:21.620> usually<00:03:21.800> make<00:03:22.040> more

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
know is that will usually make more

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.729 
know is that will usually make more
mashed<00:03:23.420> beans<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:23.989> you're<00:03:24.110> going<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.290> use<00:03:24.530> in

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
mashed beans and you're going to use in

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.350 
mashed beans and you're going to use in
a<00:03:24.830> recipe<00:03:25.160> and<00:03:25.610> we<00:03:25.790> don't<00:03:25.970> want<00:03:26.150> to<00:03:26.239> throw

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
a recipe and we don't want to throw

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.580 
a recipe and we don't want to throw
those<00:03:26.540> away<00:03:26.600> we<00:03:26.900> never<00:03:27.080> want<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.380> throw

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
those away we never want to throw

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:29.710 
those away we never want to throw
anything<00:03:27.860> away<00:03:28.160> we're<00:03:28.550> being<00:03:28.730> wasteful<00:03:29.090> so

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
anything away we're being wasteful so

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.310 
anything away we're being wasteful so
what<00:03:29.900> I<00:03:29.930> do<00:03:30.080> is<00:03:30.260> I<00:03:30.500> freeze<00:03:30.950> my<00:03:32.050> leftover<00:03:33.050> mashed

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:33.320 
what I do is I freeze my leftover mashed

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.410 
what I do is I freeze my leftover mashed
beans<00:03:33.680> and<00:03:34.100> they'll<00:03:34.610> last<00:03:34.820> in<00:03:35.090> your<00:03:35.120> freezer

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
beans and they'll last in your freezer

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.479 
beans and they'll last in your freezer
for<00:03:35.750> up<00:03:35.780> to<00:03:35.989> six<00:03:36.260> months<00:03:36.350> so<00:03:36.830> just<00:03:37.040> label<00:03:37.400> it

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
for up to six months so just label it

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.520 
for up to six months so just label it
that<00:03:37.730> it's<00:03:37.910> black<00:03:38.300> beans<00:03:38.600> or<00:03:38.900> white<00:03:39.110> beans<00:03:39.350> or

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
that it's black beans or white beans or

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.840 
that it's black beans or white beans or
whatever<00:03:39.739> it<00:03:39.920> is<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.040> then<00:03:40.340> you<00:03:40.400> can<00:03:40.580> use<00:03:40.700> it

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
whatever it is and then you can use it

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.780 
whatever it is and then you can use it
in<00:03:40.940> your<00:03:40.970> next<00:03:41.330> recipe<00:03:41.950> just<00:03:42.950> a<00:03:43.070> thought<00:03:43.220> and

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
in your next recipe just a thought and

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.150 
in your next recipe just a thought and
your<00:03:44.180> thoughts<00:03:44.989> sorry<00:03:45.380> I've<00:03:45.590> learned<00:03:45.860> that<00:03:46.010> is

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:13.990 
that's what I'm a big fan of doing it

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.170 
that's what I'm a big fan of doing it
how<00:04:14.170> your<00:04:14.320> family<00:04:14.530> likes<00:04:15.520> it<00:04:15.820> and<00:04:15.880> how<00:04:15.970> they'll

how your family likes it and how they'll

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.420 
how your family likes it and how they'll
eat<00:04:16.360> it<00:04:16.480> but<00:04:16.600> if<00:04:16.720> you<00:04:16.750> try<00:04:16.989> things<00:04:17.350> out<00:04:17.590> you

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
eat it but if you try things out you

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.930 
eat it but if you try things out you
might<00:04:18.610> find<00:04:19.060> out<00:04:19.330> the<00:04:19.510> day<00:04:19.720> don't<00:04:20.380> mind<00:04:20.620> it

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940

might find out the day don't mind it
full<00:04:21.940> black<00:04:22.840> beans<00:04:23.230> well<00:04:23.620> don't<00:04:23.830> tell<00:04:24.040> them

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
full black beans well don't tell them

full black beans well don't tell them
obviously<00:04:24.400> before<00:04:25.030> you<00:04:25.090> give<00:04:25.270> this<00:04:25.390> to<00:04:25.450> them

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
obviously before you give this to them

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.230 
obviously before you give this to them
because<00:04:25.900> like<00:04:26.320> you<00:04:26.590> it<00:04:27.430> sounds<00:04:27.490> a<00:04:28.000> little

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
because like you it sounds a little

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.720 
because like you it sounds a little
weird<00:04:28.270> but<00:04:28.780> I've<00:04:29.650> done<00:04:29.770> this<00:04:29.920> at<00:04:30.100> classes<00:04:30.550> and

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
weird but I've done this at classes and

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:34.710 
weird but I've done this at classes and
how<00:04:30.790> people<00:04:31.030> try<00:04:31.480> it<00:04:31.540> I<00:04:33.390> made<00:04:34.390> it<00:04:34.480> for<00:04:34.600> my

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
how people try it I made it for my

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.120 
how people try it I made it for my
husband<00:04:35.110> you<00:04:35.320> didn't<00:04:35.500> even<00:04:35.560> notice<00:04:35.770> there<00:04:36.070> was

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
husband you didn't even notice there was

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.000 
husband you didn't even notice there was
different<00:04:36.640> so<00:04:37.320> number<00:04:38.320> doesn't<00:04:38.590> do<00:04:38.680> this<00:04:38.800> just

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
different so number doesn't do this just

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.290 
different so number doesn't do this just
like<00:04:39.130> brownies<00:04:39.520> go<00:04:39.670> ahead<00:04:39.850> and<00:04:39.940> mix<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.210> up

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:40.300 
like brownies go ahead and mix it up

like brownies go ahead and mix it up
till<00:04:40.570> it's<00:04:40.720> barely<00:04:40.990> mixed<00:04:41.440> add<00:04:41.860> it<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.190> your

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
till it's barely mixed add it to your

till it's barely mixed add it to your
cake<00:04:43.570> pan<00:04:43.810> whatever<00:04:44.170> you're<00:04:44.350> making<00:04:44.500> them<00:04:44.800> in

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
cake pan whatever you're making them in

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.250 
cake pan whatever you're making them in
cook<00:04:45.580> them<00:04:45.850> and<00:04:46.150> i'll<00:04:46.750> go<00:04:46.870> ahead<00:04:46.900> and<00:04:47.050> take<00:04:47.230> a

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
cook them and i'll go ahead and take a

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.390 
cook them and i'll go ahead and take a
picture<00:04:47.590> so<00:04:47.620> you<00:04:47.800> can<00:04:47.860> see<00:04:48.100> if<00:04:48.160> they<00:04:48.250> don't

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
picture so you can see if they don't

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.710 
picture so you can see if they don't
look<00:04:48.580> any<00:04:48.760> different<00:04:48.970> but<00:04:49.420> you're<00:04:49.540> gonna<00:04:49.630> have

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
look any different but you're gonna have

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.290 
look any different but you're gonna have
to<00:04:49.900> take<00:04:50.110> my<00:04:50.290> word<00:04:50.320> for<00:04:50.800> it<00:04:50.830> that<00:04:51.160> they're<00:04:51.910> just
