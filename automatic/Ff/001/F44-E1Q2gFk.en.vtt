00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.710
 belen and graz the quiz hulk and here we go again but 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.480
 today for a new video of black ops 2 e 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.599
 this is a rather special video indeed 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.869
 to my first double swarm that I bring you 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:31.359
 I did it on the map nuketown 2025 with 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.750
 the pdv with a double silencer 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.160
 charger then began 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.809
 describing the class a little then I give you a 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.470
 bit of advice to do some scene 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:42.879
 here then we leave already said 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.290
 included the pdv with the silencer 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.769
 double charger that in my opinion 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:49.780
 together with the ms mc is one of the 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:51.400
 machine guns stronger than the game because 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.710
 has a very large magazine e 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.260
 with silencer that will allow you to 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.239
 don't let yourself go fishing you can go 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.239
 quietly all friends like 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.280
 secondary I had the beeb 23r that them 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:05.080
 we are going stronger than the game there 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.979
 it rains over as far as bears are concerned 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.119
 that instead I had an inflexible ghost 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.770
 it is still not clear then it was the 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:13.510
 reiterate inflexible vincent 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.060
 recall rewards with a 20 per 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:18.130
 one hundred points less then every time 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.020
 that you will make a kill you will conquer 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.929
 a flag or otherwise make donations 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:25.270
 you will avoid 20 percent notes 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:27.399
 in more than accounts and therefore for example yes 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:31.060
 a kill is made instead of 100 points ve 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.670
 it will give 120 so it goes well but what a lot 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.170
 useful in my opinion and then it allows 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.210
 just to call a lot of rewards 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.119
 less time, especially for those who go 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.920
 for swarms it's varied and very useful stuff 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.780
 here is then using 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.609
 oh well enough the obvious ghost 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:49.590
 choice so as not to be detected by 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:52.600
 wabi is then using as a second bonus 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:54.340
 jackal because with a machine gun yes 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.479
 they really waste a lot of shots and therefore 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.609
 through the newspapers I can 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:00.090
 restore as a third bonus and instead 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:02.799
 he is using over the month because anyway 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.689
 when I need it when I filter 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.600
 I do not want the enemy spots 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.789
 travel limits so let's put it this way 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.630
 I didn't have the tactical grenade but I had 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.540
 that 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.770
 the vital one I had the c4 and that up 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.260
 this game is really really a lot 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.660
 much stronger than the grenade of the seus 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.820
 in fact for those who go for type objectives 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.950
 qg stations while enemies are there 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.260
 you pull a c4 and make the massacres 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.150
 in fact, a short time ago 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:31.780
 three days ago wyatt also a clip that 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.940
 I made a share of c4 I want his 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.950
 however domain still has a range of 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.750
 really really vast explosion 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.580
 as far as the riches were concerned 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.010
 I had used orbital is really a lot 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.930
 strong because in addition to telling you locations 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.330
 enemy directions will give you points 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.990
 astista whenever he is an ally will do 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.880
 a kill and then dogs and swarms that are 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.920
 really devastating I could have made a 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.480
 triple swarm so much but look at fellon 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.480
 I can't kill a single one because 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.040
 or hurt everyone but I didn't kill anyone 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.020
 and they are saying why to some 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.020
 I was about to take the second bus 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.060
 at orbital in the same life but you want a 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.430
 still a bit of gameplay 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.530
 pretty cute I cut it because 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.000
 in the end the result was 99 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.190
 killen I remember how many died 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.380
 anyway if I had done a hundred more 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.030
 I would I would we insult 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.010
 so I decided to match 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.390
 cut the two cha names so as to render 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.330
 the less boring video because at the end 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.690
 the end is 99 kg not a hundred and that 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:30.190
 what I miss precisely 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.230
 made the video boring according to me no 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.180
 ok anyway to get bored is less 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.370
 otherwise the video really does find really 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.020
 too much, however, now it's enough to talk 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.459
 I give you some tips about poetics 

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:42.630
 to call names then of the aisia 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.190
 according to me to call and swarms 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.060
 smooth me back it sounds really bad not 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.250
 I know why 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.240
 oh well to call the swarm anyway 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.400
 let's put it this way 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.560
 need a weapon not any silencers 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.800
 weapon that you want I recommend a 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.140
 inter alia because if it will serve for the 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.420
 advice after so okay I will 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.730
 i recommend the class is co op a go to me 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.850
 the bronzes appear to be a msm cio machine gun 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.160
 pdv you choose which one according to 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.110
 your tastes are really both very 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.420
 very strong both must be 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.180
 equipped with double silencer 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.130
 charger then berlusconi with me double 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.519
 charger will allow me to recharge 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.860
 with much more speed 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.650
 will allow you not to disguise yourself or 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:28.530
 detect how as you can tell is more 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.240
 good to sgam the rest is completely 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.580
 the only thing I feel subjective about 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.770
 advise you and jackal because it goes well 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.599
 you don't know how many shots you spend 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.150
 Unyielding ghosts are a bit 

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:41.190
 indispensable and without inflexible to a 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.409
 hard to be able to call than not 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.580
 I think very tall and without ghost of 

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:46.830
 sgam for the web 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.990
 the main advice however that there is 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.789
 I want to as a second bonus as a third 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.039
 bonus sorry that a bit that two seems 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:55.620
 masked that inflexible you see a little 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:57.419
 you are the advice I can give you 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.759
 is to infiltrate the spone 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:03.000
 enemy at headquarters comes a lot 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:05.669
 well since if the enemies or at locations 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.849
 also give very well since if enemies 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:09.870
 with conquerano let's say spawn 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.719
 in the objective therefore as for example 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:14.610
 now near the lens they are reborn 

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:16.319
 behind the lens then filtering wines 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.900
 maybe hiding here I do the example 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:20.759
 made in uk town in the cottage you can 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.080
 take them all by surprise and do 

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:24.120
 really a lot who made them 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.289
 in the clip of the peat bus in 20 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:27.690
 seconds I did at the same time 

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:29.520
 setting and entering and exiting at 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.639
 location a 20 seconds I called a 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.710
 bus turbid this so I did what 

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:36.900
 1200 yes it seems to me 1200 points in 20 seconds 

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.400
 I really really could have done it 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:41.069
 to do even the fastest swarm in Italy 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.169
 also beating the inside cod 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:45.270
 But then the game is over it 

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:46.919
 after calling the swarm I had done 

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:49.259
 nor goodbye after calling the car bus 

00:05:46.919 --> 00:05:50.969
 orbital I only did one killer and then 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.469
 it was over the game I was sorry 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:54.449
 a little however I saw that you have 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:56.310
 both of them enjoyed the clips 

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:59.219
 so thank you very much 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:00.750
 however good advice I am digressing a 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:02.639
 bit too much is precisely that of 

00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.169
 infiltrate the enemy sport with 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.300
 one weapon better silenced 

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:09.539
 machine gun so as to take them 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.819
 practically everyone by surprise and want to 

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:14.759
 say it's not official I'm not 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:17.279
 managed to find a remedy 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:19.169
 camcorder records in hd because how 

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:22.319
 I already said in the video I talked about the 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.120
 dlc my broke so guys the 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:25.860
 blog I do n't bring you because I don't want to 

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:27.690
 make a troiaio with the iphone that later not 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.790
 I can avoid it maybe put some 

00:06:27.690 --> 00:06:32.290
 cut or wants to do the time 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:34.840
 that I can't put the comment that 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:36.940
 compare I prefer to wait for a 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.820
 but maybe do something one 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:42.940
 a little bit more complete, however, there is 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.640
 thank you very much because I believe now 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:48.040
 both I believe we have reached a thousand 

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:50.650
 subscribers because they are recording the video 

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:52.150
 immediately after veroli del dlc I had 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.190
 called called a bang of people for 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.380
 know they serve the video camera we have 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:58.090
 said no anyway when i load it 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:01.780
 let me think of this today 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:04.000
 loaded that of the dl dear dlc type 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:05.740
 around 4 you have to see around 4 

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.170
 I will definitely be a thousand subscribers 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.540
 feel it walter account and presumptuous 

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:12.850
 however, I thank you first 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.880
 registered and I think they will arrive 

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:18.850
 this video will have already arrived 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.920
 takes is already finishing I want to bring a 

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:23.770
 video and mitch I will do my best 

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:26.740
 I would like to bring a swarm of 23r 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.750
 since the sniper is practically used 

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:31.030
 in a game and then I began 

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:32.560
 since enemies love this only 

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:34.420
 lens banks always 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.580
 forbearance I sat at home there 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:38.290
 the b 23r for cable check in and did not send 

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:40.150
 to do iquique and I went out to call 

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:42.190
 a bus vital actor and then I'm dead and 

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.530
 so I want to try just a 

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.420
 call a swarm of 23 because it would be 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.820
 really really good guys anyway 

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:50.500
 video is ending I invite you to leave 

00:07:48.820 --> 00:07:52.630
 a nice I like to follow you liked
