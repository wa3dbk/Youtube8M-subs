00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.860
 a video today is our returning with 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.050
 the players we will do what 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.270
 we know it's what we know it 's what I know 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.550
 what are we going to do, we'll just go 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:33.210
 play a little bit yesterday 10 per wave the 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.739
 Steam that same staff a bit of 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.110
 game the walking dead save the ting 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.239
 tings and there we will come across a being 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.780
 human being is actually dead, right? 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.570
 we kill in human for you there 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.450
 make some comments about the game is 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.290
 observe your observations and observations 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.630
 about the game 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:56.489
 the game was not what I expected the land 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:59.940
 Well, more of the younger game is good. 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:05.270
 I'm a fan of the series I have to play. 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:08.250
 very top type the graphic is so good but 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:11.100
 actually it's not so good 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.829
 the zombie is a bit stupid diÃ³ the 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.540
 clowns but like somebody else is over or 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.380
 the less they take away, this is all very 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.399
 good right 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:22.409
 and like you liked the story 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:25.079
 basically dna you can look at 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:31.170
 Condel who knows who do not know was 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:32.549
 knowing what kind it is is a zombie either 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.060
 game did not take long to be 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.819
 produced not to be done let's say yes 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.159
 because the game was announced in a month and 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.529
 three or two months after the emotion already 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.319
 It was not even that way, it did not work that much. 

00:01:43.529 --> 00:01:48.990
 game at all be pretty well established 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:51.060
 become a top-of-the-line game is ours. 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:57.090
 game at least one game graphic of 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.399
 2008 even because type is very 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.419
 serious and I'm going to tell the truth I think 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.579
 You are doing what I have to 

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:03.959
 find two cans of gasoline around the 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.039
 My car because the gas in my car 

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:08.009
 ended 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.679
 I have found in the ruins to find 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.080
 supplies for my group to be able to 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.270
 continue my trip then type later 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.920
 which started the cable in which the 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.660
 first supply has time for you 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.000
 traveling in the middle of the street and 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.850
 have thrown away gas or havoc in 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.800
 stop to change cars or more the car 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.870
 until you get gas 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.860
 So can you, too. 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.320
 ne group 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.660
 the survival group for you type 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.030
 you send each one says one thing to be for 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.280
 example you for example you tidies 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.920
 pay attention you are a woman one 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.260
 man and you can send the man and 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:47.460
 look for ammunition and woman to look for 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:49.410
 food or play the game in these things 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.120
 Do you know how survival even stayed? 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.650
 very stuck with the walking dead this way 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.010
 It's another game account thing too. 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.680
 because the voices were made with you 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.620

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.090
 same voice of the Series C series not me 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.190
 mistake has be almost absolute certainty 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.590

 they are not correct are the green ones 

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:07.970
