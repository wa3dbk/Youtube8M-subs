and it's been die cut with the the
starburst<00:02:44.709> frameless<00:02:45.280> so<00:02:45.430> not<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.760> smallest

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
starburst frameless so not the smallest

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:49.890 
starburst frameless so not the smallest
but<00:02:47.470> the<00:02:47.650> next<00:02:48.070> size<00:02:48.730> up<00:02:49.060> from<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.570> smallest

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
but the next size up from the smallest

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.020 
but the next size up from the smallest
so<00:02:50.770> we<00:02:50.890> have<00:02:51.100> that<00:02:51.340> and<00:02:51.670> then<00:02:51.790> we're<00:02:51.880> going<00:02:51.970> to

decorative label punch that we're using

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.570 
decorative label punch that we're using
right<00:02:57.940> here<00:02:58.300> this<00:02:59.230> is<00:02:59.290> going<00:02:59.620> to<00:02:59.680> go<00:02:59.830> on<00:02:59.860> top<00:03:00.340> of

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
right here this is going to go on top of

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.160 
right here this is going to go on top of
here<00:03:00.790> since<00:03:01.030> we<00:03:01.180> got<00:03:01.330> the<00:03:01.480> liquid<00:03:01.630> glue<00:03:01.989> out

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
here since we got the liquid glue out

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.330 
here since we got the liquid glue out
might<00:03:02.410> as<00:03:02.530> well<00:03:02.709> use<00:03:02.890> it<00:03:04.800> so<00:03:05.800> these<00:03:05.950> layers

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
might as well use it so these layers

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.810 
might as well use it so these layers
came<00:03:07.269> from<00:03:07.480> our<00:03:07.630> inspiration<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:09.700> we're

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
came from our inspiration so we're

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.009 
came from our inspiration so we're
keeping<00:03:09.970> with<00:03:10.209> those<00:03:10.390> layers<00:03:10.570> but<00:03:10.870> we're

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
keeping with those layers but we're

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.840 
keeping with those layers but we're
definitely<00:03:11.200> changed<00:03:11.860> up<00:03:11.980> the<00:03:12.010> colors<00:03:12.519> and

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
definitely changed up the colors and

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.270 
definitely changed up the colors and
then<00:03:13.690> we<00:03:13.840> need<00:03:13.959> to<00:03:14.019> punch<00:03:14.410> this<00:03:14.709> one<00:03:14.950> out<00:03:15.100> and

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
then we need to punch this one out and

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.270 
then we need to punch this one out and
I'm<00:03:15.340> going<00:03:15.610> to<00:03:15.670> use<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:16.480> oval<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.890> scallop

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
this is going to get laid on using

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.680 
this is going to get laid on using
dimensionals<00:03:26.549> just<00:03:27.549> grab<00:03:27.910> a<00:03:27.940> couple<00:03:28.510> those
