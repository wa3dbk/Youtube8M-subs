00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.880
 hello people vicious of the formula 1 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.840
 Today I am willing to give everything one more time to tell you what happened in the 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.840
 Grand Prix of Japan played at the Suzuka Circuit 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:18.630
 pay attention that I start in three as 90 seconds 

00:00:22.569 --> 00:00:25.569
 it is really necessary to talk about the classification 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.189
 i to say the usual 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.919
 anyway 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.240
 Well, the usual pole was for the lord of the crime 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.230
 although this time the jenson button was really close to touching the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.330
 eggs 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.400
 in third position out a visibly disappointed little boy 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.910
 felipe farsa overcome for the third time in the season to braking alfonso urbón 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.230
 I was expecting more and excellent seventh of ccoo-to his and his compatriots 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.710
 the ruinous ones well but with me and with cubic roberto they would go better and that's what 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.000
 says 87% of the people 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.770
 in a poll that I just got out of my sleeve 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:02.180
 as for the rest little more to add 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.370
 except the sixteenth place leaves and I alguersauri or and the penultimate of a single 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.230
 hs with problems of hair 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.230
 I say hydraulic 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.240
 the 24 cars are ready and the traffic light gives the start to a race 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.400
 decisive 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.760
 the buttons start better than frigolé do 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.300
 but this one sends him to the grass and makes him lose a position in favor of 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.560
 jaimito while you rome cher is ranked seventh 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.150
 guinea pig does not have the desired start and goes to twelfth place 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.100
 on turn 6 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.210
 braking alfonso takes fourth place from felipe guasa 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.000
 while behind Luciano continues with his terrible weekend going from 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.580
 excursion through the gravel 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.640
 shortly after 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.220
 jamil silly has the wheels more shattered than the face of good blanket and 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.720
 he has to pit himself on lap nine after losing the position 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.680
 with your teammate 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.060
 As always all the others begin to enter and both the butanero and fucking 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.720
 they get to beat jamil tongo 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.270
 on lap 12 to appear good shit with a wheel out of place 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.770
 a lot of pressure on his pilots those of brave bull 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.560
 but at races they could do more to help them instead of 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:11.789
 do the clown 

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:16.789
 on turn 21, in the middle of the carousel of the second stops, the mailbox manages to 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:20.289
 surprise and get ahead of the race for a matter of tenths of 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:23.459
 second overtaking toilets at the exit of boxes 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.390
 almost then pizza dough and puzo amito again have something more 

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:31.280
 what words touching before the chicane and leaving a piece in the middle of 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.209
 track 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:33.489
 one turn later 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.260
 both pilots make their second stop and the Brazilian also wins the 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.649
 departure to English 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:42.819
 the piece of spoiler makes the safety car intervene I think that in a way 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:43.709
 late 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.170
 the race is restarted on lap 28 without any change 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:51.780
 has turns after tran driver returns to the load and overtakes his good 

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:56.010
 friend massacre while lining pal bottom gets put second after 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.739
 to make his third stop and successfully defends himself from the constant attempts 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.829
 from the German to give him for ass 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.929
 I say to recover his position on the finish line 

00:03:04.929 --> 00:03:09.139
 in the last moments the Spanish was thrown over a buttons with problems 

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.329
 of gasoline but lacked laps to try 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.230
 tim barton wins the race and confirms his exceptional fitness 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.209
 but all the lights went towards the undisputed world champion of 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.969
 Formula 1 in 2011 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.299
 who has completed a season to frame and who has to give the 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.649
 congratulations because he has been in another galaxy and has not given his options 

00:03:28.649 --> 00:03:29.799
 rivals 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:34.040
 curiously he did not make his best career and was vulnerable when many thought 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.049
 that in this circuit was going to crush the competition 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.229
 but in any case I doubt that you care too much at this time 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.209
 I would also like to highlight the second position of the infinity neck 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:48.059
 taking into account the circumstances in which it has been achieved in addition to 

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:52.340
 course the triumph of the left button and the comebacks of the gobi mariachi 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.799
 more since one was cold and feverish and the other one was the penultimate 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.260
 the octogenarian seems to be going more lately and achieves another good result 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.069
 Massa Pan still does not find the way and the comparison with his partner 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:06.619
 leaves in a very bad place 

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:09.959
 villa and jaime did not have the necessary rhythm to finish in the points 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.599
 while asus and lost a lot of his options when entering the anti this 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:15.719
 him at the exit 

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:17.400
 And that has been all for today 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.590
 next week we will have more 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.689
 I await your comments 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:22.959
 we'll see you in korea
