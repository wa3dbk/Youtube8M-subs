00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.040
 Andrew 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.790
 the season of the barcelona this 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:16.850
 year on a personal level that was for you 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:20.000
 this season very difficult 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.850
 we have had many ups and downs so much 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.860
 in sports subjects as extra-sports 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:27.260
 but good not less than always because of 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:29.330
 Once in a while I would go to the cold and I would fuck 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.390
 a kalise that really is what it is 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.630
 what makes me happy 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.090
 and well, it was my moment of glory, 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.130
 after so much suffering the kalise 

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.770
 for all 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:44.830
 Dutch without acrimony we can say that 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.120
 the 2010 World Cup has been achieved in 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.040
 greater measure thanks to the game of 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.130
 barcelona as you see this year 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.440
 I think it is 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.540
 there is a lot of hunger in the group 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.830
 Although still maintaining the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.180
 same blocks as you see fit and 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.220
 I hope you are valeria this is 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.210
 enough or that the Pope can not sound 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.060
 na 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.950
 to see if it is a little more outstanding and 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.630
 the truth that what good as attention 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.120
 Well let's hope to make a great 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.560
 world and have the world cup another 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:20.020

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.220

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.540

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:35.619

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.520
