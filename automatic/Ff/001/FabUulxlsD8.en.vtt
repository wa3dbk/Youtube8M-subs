making<00:00:36.470> focus<00:00:36.890> very<00:00:37.220> tough<00:00:37.640> here<00:00:38.570> is<00:00:38.809> a<00:00:38.839> shot

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
making focus very tough here is a shot

making focus very tough here is a shot
without<00:00:39.589> the<00:00:40.100> double<00:00:40.430> stack<00:00:40.640> on<00:00:40.879> the<00:00:40.910> end<00:00:41.239> and

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
without the double stack on the end and

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.049 
without the double stack on the end and
what<00:00:42.890> I'm<00:00:43.010> going<00:00:43.100> to<00:00:43.159> do<00:00:43.280> is<00:00:43.460> leave<00:00:43.699> some<00:00:44.030> of

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:44.059 
what I'm going to do is leave some of

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:47.770 
what I'm going to do is leave some of
the<00:00:44.210> adjustment<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:46.180> ISO<00:00:47.180> settings<00:00:47.600> and

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
the adjustment and ISO settings and

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.259 
the adjustment and ISO settings and
stuff<00:00:47.960> in<00:00:48.229> to<00:00:48.979> the<00:00:49.220> clips<00:00:49.790> that<00:00:49.940> I'm<00:00:50.059> showing

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
stuff in to the clips that I'm showing

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:51.490 
stuff in to the clips that I'm showing
you<00:00:50.360> today<00:00:50.540> so<00:00:50.720> you<00:00:50.900> can<00:00:50.930> kind<00:00:51.170> of<00:00:51.229> see<00:00:51.379> the

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
you today so you can kind of see the

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.119 
you today so you can kind of see the
process

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:52.129 
process

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.759 
process
that'll<00:00:52.610> be<00:00:52.729> closer<00:00:53.000> to<00:00:53.239> the<00:00:53.330> end<00:00:53.540> without<00:00:54.530> the

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:54.769 
that'll be closer to the end without the

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.210 
that'll be closer to the end without the
double<00:00:55.280> stack<00:00:55.549> you<00:00:56.089> tend<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.689> see<00:00:57.680> a<00:00:57.710> bit<00:00:58.189> more

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
double stack you tend to see a bit more

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.520 
double stack you tend to see a bit more
prominence<00:00:59.000> most<00:00:59.629> of<00:00:59.869> the<00:00:59.989> time<00:01:00.170> sometimes

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
prominence most of the time sometimes

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.350 
prominence most of the time sometimes
that's<00:01:00.949> not<00:01:01.159> true

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 
that's not true

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.149 
that's not true
with<00:01:02.659> the<00:01:02.839> double<00:01:03.140> stack<00:01:03.350> you<00:01:03.559> get<00:01:03.710> a<00:01:03.739> lot<00:01:04.010> of

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:04.159 
with the double stack you get a lot of

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.450 
with the double stack you get a lot of
surface<00:01:04.519> detail<00:01:05.860> so<00:01:06.860> what<00:01:07.040> we're<00:01:07.189> seeing<00:01:07.340> here

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:07.460 
surface detail so what we're seeing here

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.480 
surface detail so what we're seeing here
is<00:01:07.729> just<00:01:07.939> the<00:01:08.270> same<00:01:08.479> clip<00:01:09.070> processed<00:01:10.070> through

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
is just the same clip processed through

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.730 
is just the same clip processed through
you<00:01:11.000> know<00:01:11.090> contrast<00:01:11.720> color<00:01:12.080> inversion<00:01:12.470> and

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
you know contrast color inversion and

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.530 
you know contrast color inversion and
things<00:01:12.950> like<00:01:13.100> that<00:01:13.310> this<00:01:13.580> is<00:01:13.640> speeded<00:01:14.180> up<00:01:14.299> to

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
things like that this is speeded up to

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.690 
things like that this is speeded up to
show<00:01:14.750> a<00:01:15.049> little<00:01:15.530> bit<00:01:15.680> of<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:15.830> dial<00:01:16.040> in<00:01:16.310> on<00:01:16.490> the

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
show a little bit of the dial in on the

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.080 
show a little bit of the dial in on the
petal<00:01:17.450> on<00:01:17.570> which<00:01:18.280> adjust<00:01:19.280> part<00:01:19.910> of<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.150> focus

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
petal on which adjust part of the focus

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.090 
petal on which adjust part of the focus
so<00:01:23.090> as<00:01:23.210> I<00:01:23.360> was<00:01:23.510> shooting<00:01:23.690> today<00:01:23.990> a<00:01:24.140> couple

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
so as I was shooting today a couple

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.649 
so as I was shooting today a couple
things<00:01:25.370> did<00:01:25.610> go<00:01:25.790> through<00:01:26.000> frame<00:01:26.330> and<00:01:26.600> I'll

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
things did go through frame and I'll

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:27.970 
things did go through frame and I'll
show<00:01:26.900> them<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.050> you<00:01:27.200> but<00:01:27.440> I'm<00:01:27.530> gonna<00:01:27.680> need<00:01:27.770> a

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980 
show them to you but I'm gonna need a

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.190 
show them to you but I'm gonna need a
few<00:01:28.220> hundred<00:01:28.640> more<00:01:28.760> hours<00:01:29.120> of<00:01:29.200> telescopic

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
few hundred more hours of telescopic

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.380 
few hundred more hours of telescopic
filming<00:01:30.560> on<00:01:30.680> the<00:01:30.710> Sun<00:01:31.010> to<00:01:31.790> feel<00:01:31.970> comfortable

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
filming on the Sun to feel comfortable

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.940 
filming on the Sun to feel comfortable
making<00:01:32.780> a<00:01:32.990> call<00:01:33.170> on<00:01:33.380> what<00:01:33.560> any<00:01:33.710> of<00:01:33.800> these

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
making a call on what any of these

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.500 
making a call on what any of these
things<00:01:34.190> are<00:01:34.490> I<00:01:34.520> think<00:01:34.760> the<00:01:35.030> first<00:01:35.240> one<00:01:35.360> is

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:35.510 
things are I think the first one is

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.260 
things are I think the first one is
almost<00:01:35.870> certainly<00:01:36.260> a<00:01:36.350> bird<00:01:36.680> my<00:01:37.550> did<00:01:37.730> glance<00:01:38.030> up

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
almost certainly a bird my did glance up

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.700 
almost certainly a bird my did glance up
I<00:01:38.390> didn't<00:01:38.630> see<00:01:38.780> him<00:01:38.900> but<00:01:39.110> I'm<00:01:39.290> pretty<00:01:39.620> sure

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
I didn't see him but I'm pretty sure

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.340 
I didn't see him but I'm pretty sure
it's<00:01:40.010> a<00:01:40.130> bird<00:01:40.340> the<00:01:40.520> second<00:01:40.880> one<00:01:41.030> I<00:01:41.300> don't<00:01:41.990> know

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
it's a bird the second one I don't know

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.140 
it's a bird the second one I don't know
what<00:01:42.560> it<00:01:42.650> is<00:01:42.680> it's<00:01:43.400> in<00:01:43.550> a<00:01:43.610> pretty<00:01:43.790> straight

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
what it is it's in a pretty straight

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.640 
what it is it's in a pretty straight
trajectory<00:01:44.720> we'll<00:01:44.900> take<00:01:45.080> a<00:01:45.110> look<00:01:45.350> at<00:01:45.440> it<00:01:45.530> in<00:01:45.590> a

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:45.650 
trajectory we'll take a look at it in a

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.440 
trajectory we'll take a look at it in a
second<00:01:46.010> anyhow<00:01:46.370> here's<00:01:46.640> the<00:01:46.790> prominences

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450 
second anyhow here's the prominences

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.670 
second anyhow here's the prominences
that<00:01:48.110> were<00:01:49.120> mostly<00:01:50.120> visible<00:01:50.479> throughout<00:01:51.470> the

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
that were mostly visible throughout the

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.760 
that were mostly visible throughout the
filming<00:01:52.070> today<00:01:52.400> and<00:01:52.790> on<00:01:53.330> the<00:01:53.479> right<00:01:53.690> in<00:01:53.990> one<00:01:54.680> of

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
filming today and on the right in one of

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:55.810 
filming today and on the right in one of
the<00:01:54.860> views<00:01:55.070> you<00:01:55.220> can<00:01:55.250> see<00:01:55.580> that<00:01:55.729> the

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
the views you can see that the

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.000 
the views you can see that the
prominence<00:01:56.299> is<00:01:56.420> coming<00:01:56.780> over<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.560> limb<00:01:57.799> of

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
prominence is coming over the limb of

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.039 
prominence is coming over the limb of
the<00:01:58.040> Sun<00:01:58.190> there's<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.180> pretty<00:01:59.390> good<00:01:59.600> view<00:01:59.900> right

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
the Sun there's a pretty good view right

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.649 
the Sun there's a pretty good view right
there<00:02:00.320> and<00:02:00.560> most<00:02:01.520> of<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.790> views<00:02:02.090> where<00:02:02.450> it's

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
there and most of the views where it's

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.690 
there and most of the views where it's
improved<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.740> really<00:02:03.979> have<00:02:04.130> to<00:02:04.280> do<00:02:04.400> it<00:02:04.490> in<00:02:04.610> the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
improved you really have to do it in the

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.910 
improved you really have to do it in the
editing<00:02:05.000> room<00:02:05.060> because<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.750> DSLR<00:02:06.500> chip

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:06.920 
editing room because the DSLR chip

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.080 
editing room because the DSLR chip
doesn't<00:02:07.640> handle<00:02:08.149> h-alpha<00:02:09.140> that<00:02:09.530> well<00:02:09.739> but<00:02:10.129> I'm

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
doesn't handle h-alpha that well but I'm

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.360 
doesn't handle h-alpha that well but I'm
gonna<00:02:11.360> be<00:02:11.540> getting<00:02:11.810> some<00:02:11.840> tools<00:02:12.319> pretty<00:02:13.099> soon

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
gonna be getting some tools pretty soon

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.430 
gonna be getting some tools pretty soon
here<00:02:13.670> that<00:02:14.239> should<00:02:14.510> help<00:02:14.720> with<00:02:14.840> that<00:02:15.170> and

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
here that should help with that and

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.050 
here that should help with that and
there's<00:02:15.920> a<00:02:15.980> pretty<00:02:16.310> good<00:02:16.549> view<00:02:16.819> of<00:02:16.940> the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
there's a pretty good view of the

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.619 
there's a pretty good view of the
prominences<00:02:18.370> now<00:02:19.370> this<00:02:19.579> is<00:02:19.730> where<00:02:19.969> there<00:02:20.480> was

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
prominences now this is where there was

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.030 
prominences now this is where there was
the<00:02:20.810> object<00:02:21.230> that<00:02:21.349> went<00:02:21.529> through<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:21.950> I'll

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
the object that went through and I'll

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.140 
the object that went through and I'll
slow<00:02:22.249> it<00:02:22.279> down<00:02:22.430> once

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
slow it down once

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.729 
slow it down once
I'm<00:02:23.239> pretty<00:02:23.510> sure<00:02:23.659> this<00:02:23.930> one's<00:02:24.140> probably<00:02:24.439> a

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
I'm pretty sure this one's probably a

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.729 
I'm pretty sure this one's probably a
bird<00:02:25.060> in<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.599> daytime<00:02:26.989> there's<00:02:27.260> a<00:02:27.319> lot<00:02:27.590> of

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:27.739 
bird in the daytime there's a lot of

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:30.910 
bird in the daytime there's a lot of
things<00:02:27.980> flying<00:02:28.250> so<00:02:29.209> that<00:02:30.200> differs<00:02:30.680> at

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
things flying so that differs at

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.380 
things flying so that differs at
nighttime<00:02:31.129> there's<00:02:31.579> not<00:02:31.760> that<00:02:31.909> many<00:02:32.090> things

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
nighttime there's not that many things

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.830 
nighttime there's not that many things
fly<00:02:32.659> in<00:02:32.870> here

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
fly in here

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.809 
fly in here
now<00:02:35.840> over<00:02:36.110> here<00:02:36.140> one's<00:02:36.769> gonna<00:02:36.950> shoot<00:02:37.459> across

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
now over here one's gonna shoot across

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.670 
now over here one's gonna shoot across
there<00:02:38.239> it<00:02:38.360> goes<00:02:38.569> it's<00:02:38.959> in<00:02:39.049> a<00:02:39.140> pretty<00:02:39.349> straight

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
there it goes it's in a pretty straight

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.979 
there it goes it's in a pretty straight
trajectory<00:02:40.280> it<00:02:40.579> has<00:02:40.849> time<00:02:41.209> to<00:02:41.239> look<00:02:41.629> at<00:02:41.840> some

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
trajectory it has time to look at some

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.449 
trajectory it has time to look at some
of<00:02:42.109> the<00:02:42.170> things<00:02:42.379> we<00:02:42.590> film<00:02:42.829> transiting<00:02:43.430> the

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:43.459 
of the things we film transiting the

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:46.000 
of the things we film transiting the
moon<00:02:43.790> but<00:02:44.659> again<00:02:44.959> I'm<00:02:45.140> gonna<00:02:45.230> need<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.530> lot<00:02:45.799> more

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
moon but again I'm gonna need a lot more

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.619 
moon but again I'm gonna need a lot more
experience<00:02:46.400> with<00:02:46.760> the<00:02:46.849> solar<00:02:47.090> scope<00:02:47.450> before

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:47.629 
experience with the solar scope before

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:50.349 
experience with the solar scope before
I'm<00:02:47.900> comfortable<00:02:48.459> trying<00:02:49.459> to<00:02:49.549> make<00:02:49.700> a<00:02:49.730> call<00:02:50.030> on

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:50.359 
I'm comfortable trying to make a call on

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:55.809 
I'm comfortable trying to make a call on
what<00:02:50.659> these<00:02:50.870> things<00:02:51.109> are<00:02:53.230> not<00:02:54.230> sure<00:02:54.700> you<00:02:55.700> know

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:55.819 
what these things are not sure you know

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:57.640 
what these things are not sure you know
we're<00:02:55.970> blocking<00:02:56.239> about<00:02:56.599> I<00:02:56.870> don't<00:02:57.049> know<00:02:57.200> 90

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
we're blocking about I don't know 90

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.319 
we're blocking about I don't know 90
some<00:02:57.859> percent<00:02:57.889> of<00:02:58.340> the<00:02:58.400> light<00:02:58.609> so<00:02:59.000> I've<00:02:59.299> just

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
some percent of the light so I've just

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.059 
some percent of the light so I've just
got<00:02:59.599> to<00:02:59.720> get<00:02:59.780> used<00:02:59.989> to<00:03:00.109> the<00:03:00.260> tools<00:03:00.500> and<00:03:00.829> become

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
got to get used to the tools and become

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.420 
got to get used to the tools and become
more<00:03:01.250> familiar<00:03:01.310> and<00:03:02.290> in<00:03:03.290> filming<00:03:03.739> the<00:03:03.889> Sun<00:03:04.129> I'm

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
more familiar and in filming the Sun I'm

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.949 
more familiar and in filming the Sun I'm
doing<00:03:04.670> the<00:03:04.760> reverse<00:03:05.090> of<00:03:05.299> what<00:03:05.480> I<00:03:05.510> did<00:03:05.720> at<00:03:05.840> the

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
doing the reverse of what I did at the

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.809 
doing the reverse of what I did at the
moon<00:03:06.109> I<00:03:06.319> spent<00:03:06.590> years<00:03:06.859> learning<00:03:07.250> about<00:03:07.489> the

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:07.819 
moon I spent years learning about the

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.819 
moon I spent years learning about the
moon<00:03:08.030> just<00:03:08.450> to<00:03:08.720> understand<00:03:09.260> that<00:03:09.409> I<00:03:09.470> need<00:03:09.680> to

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
moon just to understand that I need to

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.770 
moon just to understand that I need to
unlearn<00:03:10.250> a<00:03:10.549> lot<00:03:10.879> of<00:03:11.000> what<00:03:11.150> I<00:03:11.180> was<00:03:11.359> told<00:03:11.629> about

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
unlearn a lot of what I was told about

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.839 
unlearn a lot of what I was told about
the<00:03:11.900> moon<00:03:12.230> with<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.069> Sun<00:03:13.280> I'm<00:03:13.489> doing<00:03:13.760> the

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
the moon with the Sun I'm doing the

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.000 
the moon with the Sun I'm doing the
reverse<00:03:14.180> of<00:03:14.359> that<00:03:14.420> I'm<00:03:15.230> gonna<00:03:15.439> teach<00:03:15.739> myself

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
reverse of that I'm gonna teach myself

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:19.750 
reverse of that I'm gonna teach myself
as<00:03:16.459> I<00:03:16.670> go<00:03:16.849> along<00:03:17.590> what<00:03:18.590> seems<00:03:19.010> important<00:03:19.609> to<00:03:19.670> me

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
as I go along what seems important to me

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.759 
as I go along what seems important to me
and<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.450> will<00:03:20.629> occasionally<00:03:20.900> reference<00:03:21.560> that

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
and I will occasionally reference that

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.690 
and I will occasionally reference that
with<00:03:22.129> what<00:03:22.639> we<00:03:22.670> are<00:03:22.879> told<00:03:23.120> about<00:03:23.329> the<00:03:23.599> Sun<00:03:24.700> so

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
with what we are told about the Sun so

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.729 
with what we are told about the Sun so
there's<00:03:25.939> the<00:03:26.150> focus<00:03:26.569> watch<00:03:27.019> the<00:03:27.260> prominence

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
there's the focus watch the prominence

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.229 
there's the focus watch the prominence
you'll<00:03:27.919> see<00:03:28.099> the<00:03:28.190> prominence<00:03:28.669> come<00:03:28.879> in<00:03:29.060> and

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
you'll see the prominence come in and

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:32.740 
you'll see the prominence come in and
out<00:03:29.299> as<00:03:29.599> I'm<00:03:30.319> adjusting<00:03:31.280> the<00:03:31.370> Edel<00:03:31.669> on<00:03:31.849> and<00:03:32.180> the

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
out as I'm adjusting the Edel on and the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.939 
out as I'm adjusting the Edel on and the
blocking<00:03:33.019> filter<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.889> the<00:03:34.099> focus<00:03:34.489> ring<00:03:35.949> and

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
blocking filter and the focus ring and

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:38.259 
blocking filter and the focus ring and
here's<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.340> final<00:03:37.549> view<00:03:37.849> we're<00:03:38.030> going<00:03:38.209> to

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:38.269 
here's the final view we're going to

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:41.289 
here's the final view we're going to
take<00:03:39.099> there's<00:03:40.099> the<00:03:40.310> best<00:03:40.489> prominence<00:03:41.060> of<00:03:41.209> the

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
take there's the best prominence of the

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:42.849 
take there's the best prominence of the
day<00:03:41.449> although<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.019> one<00:03:42.199> in<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.379> lower<00:03:42.530> left

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:42.859 
day although the one in the lower left

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:45.009 
day although the one in the lower left
limb<00:03:43.129> did<00:03:43.519> at<00:03:43.760> times<00:03:43.790> look<00:03:44.329> pretty<00:03:44.569> good<00:03:44.750> it

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
limb did at times look pretty good it

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.930 
limb did at times look pretty good it
was<00:03:45.139> just<00:03:45.349> the<00:03:45.440> focus<00:03:45.650> was<00:03:45.949> so<00:03:46.159> difficult<00:03:46.430> with

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
was just the focus was so difficult with

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.849 
was just the focus was so difficult with
the<00:03:47.120> chem<00:03:47.840> planes<00:03:48.139> flying<00:03:48.500> at<00:03:48.650> high<00:03:48.829> altitude

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
the chem planes flying at high altitude
