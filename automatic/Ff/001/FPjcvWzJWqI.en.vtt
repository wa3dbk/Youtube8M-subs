functionality<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:41.010> not<00:00:41.280> tighten<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.670> top

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
functionality is to not tighten the top

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.270 
functionality is to not tighten the top
cap<00:00:42.030> all<00:00:42.270> away<00:00:42.690> instead<00:00:43.410> put<00:00:43.680> pressure<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.160> the

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
cap all away instead put pressure on the

but<00:01:15.000> it's<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.240> another<00:01:15.450> feature<00:01:15.689> they've

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
but it's just another feature they've

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.990 
but it's just another feature they've
added<00:01:16.259> for<00:01:16.470> convenience<00:01:16.979> what<00:01:17.640> gives<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
making it a standardized size so if you

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.890 
making it a standardized size so if you
