00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.350
 or up to 2 short 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:04.710
 the state gives a thousand laps to the rock 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.149
 He has a computer with a touch screen and a system of 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.610
 navigation is good by releasing the work the maximum engine temperature is 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.219
 41 degrees and that we remain well received by passing two 

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.230
 the state can transport two people moving almost 15 kilometers through 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.489
 hour and grow a one ton weight left the vehicle has reached point 2 

00:00:23.999 --> 00:00:26.999
 Several orders confirms the arrival successfully 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.869
 the rover - can also be operated by voice commands 

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.270
 you dt 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.430
 1 we have also incorporated an automatic pilot with him and we order the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.470
 vehicle that you go to a farmer go back to the base and so you do not have to do anything 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.470
 plus two does not have the necessary information to guide itself 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.170
 the eyes of the escaut are two cameras that go to the front 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.590
 and that allow you to see in depth thanks to a computer 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.690
 this computer can analyze distances in real time 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.860
 we can go back in front 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.440
 when a person moves in front of the vehicle the state was followed by a 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:05.600
 prudential distance even worse if you're working four case doing 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.860
 anything but it will continue as we publish a puppy 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.820
 according to so that when you have finished you do not have to go back to look for the car 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.820
 but the car that has followed all the way 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.010
 if there are no astronauts nearby the robotic direction moves thanks to 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.010
 a navigation system known as crisis 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.330
 de la isis visualizes and processes a virtual landscape from the topography 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.840
 up to temperature six hits connected red 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.720
 here those dates do not treat the debut of the vehicle and take it to 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.790
 point to play 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.790
 by sectors 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.950
 The vehicle has been retired and you can go to the point 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.500
 well moving to the 1 3 2 1 point in motion 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.700
 check 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.700
 the multiple angles give the operator a panoramic perspective 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.400
 suÃ¡rez 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.050
 we confirm for the bicolor 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.970
 I was sure I'll be like milk meat fish or maybe others 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:09.589
 in the future 

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:13.849
 maybe this same technology guides astronauts in a virtual environment 

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:18.650
 1 we could use a system like this in helmet use 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.690
 and so when you walk you can see this market with reality and while 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.650
 I observe I will not have to look down to see a map and go back to 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.380
 upload a thousand of this and it will be part of the normal vision 

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:35.749
 in just a few years this technology will become part of the great adventure 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.479
 of our era 

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:40.479
 the first trip to the moon of the 21st century 

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:45.189
 these are the machines that should allow us to create an environment 

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.189
 self-sufficient in the most inhospitable place 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:53.349
 even with these technological advances 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:56.349
 It is clear that the risks of this endeavor are many 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.549
 but the possible reward of a lunar colony is even greater was in 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.560
 the moon is very large of oils program 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.750
 besides taking advantage of that to go further we can learn from us 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.750
 they could then go to more distant places 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:14.950
 dt dunga before people get excited when they see that we build these lares 

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:19.350
 we always send images of people working on the surface of the 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.349
 moon again 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:23.419
 one and 40 years later 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:27.729
 this exhibition slogan can send a man to the moon can be done 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:32.349
 anything this office and still does not decide what team people relate that 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:33.379
 capacity 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:36.379
 with greatness 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:37.399
