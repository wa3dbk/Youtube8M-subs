bit do you know that goes would the fact

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.720 
bit do you know that goes would the fact
that<00:03:12.519> we<00:03:13.109> touch<00:03:14.109> that<00:03:14.379> puts<00:03:14.680> us<00:03:14.799> ahead<00:03:15.010> we<00:03:15.549> have

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
that we touch that puts us ahead we have

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.460 
that we touch that puts us ahead we have
