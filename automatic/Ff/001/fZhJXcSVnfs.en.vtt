00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
what you can clearly see here is that

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.940 
essentially a p90 bobbin that's wound
like<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.340> traditional<00:01:23.850> p90<00:01:24.650> so<00:01:25.650> when<00:01:25.830> this

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
like of traditional p90 so when this

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
like of traditional p90 so when this

get from our custom shop when the Custom

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.999 
get from our custom shop when the Custom
Shop<00:01:49.110> would<00:01:49.500> put<00:01:49.710> in<00:01:49.800> an<00:01:49.920> ala<00:01:50.070> ko5<00:01:50.580> magnet<00:01:51.270> into

Shop would put in an ala ko5 magnet into
one<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.100> our<00:01:53.220> rails<00:01:53.460> pickups<00:01:53.970> but<00:01:54.810> now<00:01:54.960> it's

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
one of our rails pickups but now it's

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.910 
one of our rails pickups but now it's
available<00:01:55.710> inside<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.429> the<00:01:56.670> P<00:01:56.850> rails<00:01:57.770> now<00:01:58.770> what

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
available inside of the P rails now what

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.279 
available inside of the P rails now what
kind<00:01:59.069> of<00:01:59.100> sound<00:01:59.310> does<00:01:59.399> that<00:01:59.580> give<00:01:59.729> us<00:01:59.759> well

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
kind of sound does that give us well

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.450 
kind of sound does that give us well
essentially<00:02:01.289> that's<00:02:01.679> going<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.009> give<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.160> tone

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
essentially that's going to give a tone

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.450 
essentially that's going to give a tone
that's<00:02:02.759> usable<00:02:03.179> for<00:02:03.990> single<00:02:04.619> coil<00:02:04.860> tones<00:02:05.220> like

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
that's usable for single coil tones like

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.029 
that's usable for single coil tones like
strat<00:02:05.789> type<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.179> tones<00:02:06.360> that<00:02:07.229> will<00:02:07.619> be<00:02:07.710> more

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
strat type of tones that will be more

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.590 
strat type of tones that will be more
authentic<00:02:08.429> than<00:02:08.789> what<00:02:09.030> you've<00:02:09.179> ever<00:02:09.360> heard

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.600 
authentic than what you've ever heard

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.280 
authentic than what you've ever heard
from<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.990> split<00:02:10.910> humbucker<00:02:11.910> type<00:02:12.210> tone<00:02:12.540> that

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
from a split humbucker type tone that

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.130 
from a split humbucker type tone that
will<00:02:13.800> utilize<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.520> slug<00:02:14.940> coil<00:02:15.240> or<00:02:15.450> a<00:02:15.480> screw<00:02:15.810> coil

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
will utilize a slug coil or a screw coil

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.250 
will utilize a slug coil or a screw coil
from<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:16.980> normal<00:02:17.250> humbucker<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.790> so<00:02:18.690> then<00:02:19.140> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
from a normal humbucker and so then the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.960 
from a normal humbucker and so then the
next<00:02:19.440> question<00:02:19.560> is<00:02:19.980> well<00:02:20.160> what<00:02:20.520> do<00:02:20.580> I<00:02:20.640> get<00:02:20.760> when

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
next question is well what do I get when

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.350 
next question is well what do I get when
I<00:02:21.030> put<00:02:21.240> them<00:02:21.300> together<00:02:21.680> well<00:02:22.790> in<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.910> reality

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
I put them together well in the reality

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.690 
I put them together well in the reality
is<00:02:24.510> that<00:02:24.540> there<00:02:24.930> are<00:02:25.080> two<00:02:25.560> sounds<00:02:26.250> basically

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
is that there are two sounds basically

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.770 
is that there are two sounds basically
that<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:26.970> get<00:02:27.150> when<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.420> put<00:02:27.569> them<00:02:27.660> together

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
that you get when you put them together

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.510 
that you get when you put them together
the<00:02:28.140> first<00:02:28.380> sound<00:02:28.680> that<00:02:28.800> you're<00:02:29.040> able<00:02:29.160> to<00:02:29.280> get

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
the first sound that you're able to get

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.610 
the first sound that you're able to get
is<00:02:29.760> when<00:02:30.420> you<00:02:30.540> wire<00:02:30.750> them<00:02:30.930> in<00:02:30.990> series<00:02:31.050> just

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
is when you wire them in series just

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.949 
is when you wire them in series just
like<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.770> normal<00:02:32.010> humbucker<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:33.330> get<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.510> big

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
like a normal humbucker you get a big

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.260 
like a normal humbucker you get a big
high<00:02:34.560> output<00:02:35.150> tough<00:02:36.150> meaty<00:02:36.810> type<00:02:37.140> of<00:02:37.319> tone

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
high output tough meaty type of tone

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.070 
high output tough meaty type of tone
good<00:02:39.270> for<00:02:39.480> you<00:02:39.600> for<00:02:39.630> use<00:02:39.959> in<00:02:40.140> rock<00:02:40.860> heavy<00:02:41.250> blues
