00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.620
 hi here altercation last December on mountain 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.210
 the edge is almost four months old 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.259
 here and there in some jersey 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.859
 very close to the ocean 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:22.310
 here still still damn 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:24.930
 going on now I will show here so here 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:29.939
 the boat from here brought her still 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:35.040
 nobody has removed here 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:39.059
 destroyed here also here is the boat 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.010
 worth even carried by and up here to the water 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.980
 it's not so close of course but 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.920
 anyway, I really brought here well 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.370
 in general there is a mess of some people here 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.190
 far from all settled back now 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:58.039
 I will go further show 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:58.039
 date at all tin's still 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.490
 here here apparently already repaired almost all 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:11.540
 and here too 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:15.200
 I'll come over here to the parking lot 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:18.939
 See how the fence is demolished, he lies 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.950
 we see because never and 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:25.399
 booth probably shop there was that he 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.729
 I'll leave now 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:33.310
 here look what's going on this fence 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:38.390
 It was like that, that's it, that's all 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:46.780
 specifically demolished opa well as figase 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:46.780
 their crack is how loud 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.200
 big triangle such 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.869
 gaggle is very much a house worth too 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.140
 what is directly from the water 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:09.530
 the first one is also here something else boarded up 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:12.470
 and here too 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.080
 a little boarded up 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.040
 trees he 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.040
 got a little bit 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:23.750
 and the box is quiet now open geese 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.940
 what hung there elite gulls 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.940
 and geese-geese about 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:36.510
 very much like that and he still has a hole not a building 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.510
 you can be stunned 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.310
 that's the way until I left here by chance 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.750
 I saw here from afar manhattan 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:58.300
 not only manhattan can be seen here still Moscow 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:58.300
 times well and part of the cork is also something 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.020
 some people 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:19.190
 these houses have either not suffered either here 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.190
 already returned residents do not know repaired 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:28.280
 there was parking free to the beach 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.489
 Well, now in its place here is a big 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:33.770
 big pile of trash 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.190
 what to do 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:40.120
 okay anyway now the beach is not needed 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.530
 February end of February 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.570
 this house is not clear to me what 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.890
 happened like he is not near the shore and 

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:51.380
 other houses are normal 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.780
 but this one has a whole lower floor 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:56.420
 demolished and indeed the whole 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:04:00.910
 rebuilds it weird at all but 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:05.110
 such things are going further and further 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:05.110
 ok relative 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.090
 selling a house wondering who won't 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.250
 buy from home now near the shore here 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.849
 I personally am not going to buy near the water 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.690
 the house because then what for it needs a pancake 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:22.630
 will take another wave of the next good 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:26.050
 would have nothing but everything 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:27.729
 here they understand the probability of having it there 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.800
 many years time but she still 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.120
 present 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.120
 so well him
