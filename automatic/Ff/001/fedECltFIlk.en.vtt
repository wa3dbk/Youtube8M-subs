00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:05.120
 Hello 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.139
 I am only ourselves 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:09.929
 p 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.419
 I had the chance flow 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.419
 loos-en-gohelle 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.769
 kuchma of ideals text c 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.900
 from zero 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.399
 I think it's a good thing 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.210
 and especially friends 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.009
 but I was surprised 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.380
 a construction site at home on Sunday 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.670
 the film that is worth fire 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.450
 a nice rib of beef is nice 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.450
 and then a day away with water 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.540
 and writing is what you want when that's all for one euro 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.770
 within a week 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.770
 I mean some pretty interesting results 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.590
 but for me will find a solution a score the action dropped 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.020
 decryption of what the prefecture 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.190
 the slope is a little dream was found someone who was very bad 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.210
 In the region 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.210
 who can provide us with the water 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.730
 the perso people I stay machine 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.070
 so 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.130
 e I was there 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.380
 and I was 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.680
 it's here 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.560
 where I tested 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.560
 I thought of harcourt ceto 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.890
 so at the end of the year 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.890
 I said to myself 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.700
 how to market 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.120
 and I started this machine is expensive that's what my gift and 2010 to 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.170
 first quarter time what 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.560
 I complain about them 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.370
 I'm part of this j -c 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.710
 in fact this strain son time to install the game 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.140
 I was referring to the installation a little different because I criticize this is 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.350
 the couple chastanet small kitchen etc 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.810
 he set so that 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.420
 can not some hot season 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.769
 because in fact no 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.769
 and then I think that's what the prosecutor 

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:13.959
 and M 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.009
 I started 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:20.009
 and you have to know one thing I'm involved with one leg 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.939
 and for some time 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.939
 the problems what criteria ever 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.239
 difficulty getting up and even missing the seats 

00:02:33.029 --> 00:02:34.590
 Thursday the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.959
 appalling in addition to that 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.239
 moreover the owner 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.159
 so 

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:44.009
 essart 

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:47.139
 I will finish finishing champion 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:48.849
 g 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.909
 but I feel like it starts and that's all when I was 7 years old 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:57.039
 and I do not know how to introduce her after that 

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:58.609
 bravo the past 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:01.259
 we are skeptical to sissonne 

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.869
 at 103 to his credit growth morning so yes women still know 

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:05.639
 some days 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:07.539
 I lost three pounds 3 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.819
 and I did not make this sacrifice am not done with difficulty I do not leave 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:12.709
 reacted it is useless 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:13.620
 it is true 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.319
 I use it seems that che there must love 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.499
 who but give a little help 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:20.469
 as complementary 

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.859
 but Sunday it would have to be done 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:25.719
 so it's really this water that made this difference 

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:29.009
 and the big difference that he was really impressive 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:31.139
 this law 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:34.529
 the beds picot off the comoros the financier 

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:37.779
 for this meaning without being able to conclude 

00:03:37.779 --> 00:03:39.209
 frightful 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.059
 and I start arras 

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:43.289
 Feel better with less 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:47.159
 what justifies that I was really afraid to have me operate and I hope 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.029
 that the past aside 

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:51.909
 but it will take time for that 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.029
 what I propose is 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:57.119
 since a few months 

00:03:57.119 --> 00:04:01.060
 wants to put some water first I need as a fitting of honor 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:03.729
 one of them two weeks in the week 

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.249
 to try 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.469
 daddy if you will not buy the machine like me 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.819
 agree the slaughter and the sexy you will be disappointed by too far and your 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:13.960
 mileage party 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.040
 me it was 200 kilometers an hour it's a paul to 

00:04:18.529 --> 00:04:19.909
 and the same 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:24.109
 I encourage you to see after these five sets after that 

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:27.249
 the difference in parliaments 

00:04:27.249 --> 00:04:29.870
 as you can watch it 

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.050
 on a video besides the exhibition 

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.010
 and for sure 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:39.349
 unfortunately for those who do not speak English at all 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:42.349
 there are they have in 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:46.039
 heller there is something that is super interesting 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.520
 it is launched 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.340
 he teaches roubini 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.009
 thursday m 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:57.659
 kyo certain notoriety 

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:00.770
 who use the water as the claim philippe thing like that 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:05.739
 emitted who is talking about this very alkaline hockey 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:09.919
 and well-being and that brings you since you do 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.400
 the extremely acidic procession 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.080
 I'm going to a very similar practice 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.780
 I know I will not say that I realized that I was drinking 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:19.720
 a lot a lot of people 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.120
 of that this loan yet on the side 1 

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.349
 % and things like that 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:27.439
 removing airco 

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:30.400
 what we do not know how to get away with it goes back to 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.860
 and percent 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.870
 laurent 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.870
 I think I have already decreased the rate of acidity of which body 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.199
 michel provision 

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:43.479
 take but listen come keep 8 

00:05:43.479 --> 00:05:45.979
 discreetly 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:49.249
 and then who knows maybe that above the surprising results 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:53.509
 no, it's not just an arm, but maybe you should ask 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:56.360
 the parapet and believe like me I did it 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:58.449
 I wish that any other nature 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:05:58.899
 see you soon
