00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.300
 ratillo here you have the mallow that you 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:11.019
 I showed the other day and I told you that 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.980
 good is a food not recommended 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:13.980
 for diabetics 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.900
 it is a food hyperglycemia before the 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.710
 contrary that this plant is good 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.349
 let's see here the blond sea a 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:30.110
 and hypoglycemic food that is 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:31.970
 Recommended mostly for many types 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.059
 of diabetes to realize that many 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.940
 types of diabetes are treated with good 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.740
 hypoglycemic foods or be taken 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.760
 orally 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.890
 apparently arrived at a point then 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:49.160
 you even start to combine the 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:51.890
 insulin with these foods until good 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.320
 of certain types of diabetes that 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.320
 it seems you can not fight like that but 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.210
 yes, good to drink from time to time 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.300
 rich foods glycemia before then 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:06.100
 can come in very good in the treatment 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.439
 or in the diet for diabetes 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.680
 everything as always I tell you everything has two 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:14.550
 faces 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.820
 here we can see as I say this 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.100
 plant that for example is good for 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.920
 all kinds of bronchial conditions the 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.070
 Asthma is a balsamic 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.250
 excellent a band a balsamic 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.750
 very good the infusions that you do for 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.510
 example with these plants you can 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.120
 make for example a teaspoon of 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.830
 leaves and good the flowers are you 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.980
 you see here 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.140
 of these leaves and these little flowers with 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:46.590
 a teaspoon for a good bowl one 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.010
 Good good infusion is enough and 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.720
 realize that good infusions 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.430
 the plants you use and in the infusion 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.680
 that she has used it 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.560
 it means that I do not have say 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.660
 essence or that same plant you can 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.900
 use for a next infusion 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:10.220
 perfectly although it may be a 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:15.560
 well a little softer is also 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:18.620
 let's say its benefits interesting 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.440
 another thing we can see from this plant 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.470
 is it going well for fever is a 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.420
 natural antipyretic 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.740
 for any type of fever 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:33.590
 infusions 23 infusions that you have 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.420
 good this kind of affections three 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.700
 inclusions four infusions a day 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.850
 Well, you can come well against the 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.370
 fever also for some conditions 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.970
 of the liver for example comes in handy 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.790
 because it creates help the body to create 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:52.960
 bile naturally what for some 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.700
 affections say the liver 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:58.040
 obviously it comes very well 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.920
 one of the most interesting things maybe 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.790
 that have say let's be more blond is that 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.030
 good is 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.450
 an anticancer plant to say it 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.819
 somehow and what good helps 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.969
 prevent in risks say 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.210
 heart diseases 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:21.470
 heart and others 

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:24.830
 this is due to one of the ingredients 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.810
 of its essence to say it of some 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.270
 way has different types of 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:33.100
 flavonoids and the flavonoids are 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.100
 let's say one of the 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.480
 substances recommended and used in 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.860
 pharmaceutical company to combat this kind of 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.890
 diseases, realize that 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.130
 flavonoids are actually in all 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.690
 the plants are not at one level or another in 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.080
 all the plants of the earth and even 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.020
 in some seaweed 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.360
 are those flavonoids are responsible 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:59.120
 of the color of the color they have 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.090
 example the flowers the leaves of the 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:04.310
 plants and so on or those flavonoids 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.210
 As I say, they are in all 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:11.540
 plants therefore when consuming for example 

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:15.110
 by having a diet based on 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.820
 plant will have flavonoids 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.670
 different types because I already tell you there are 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:22.250
 many types of flavonoids will be 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.590
 most recommended or best for a type 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.080
 of conditions and others for others 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:29.600
 they will have more content and others less 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.900
 all vegetables have flavonoids and 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.230
 the flavonoids are already I say good for 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.060
 prevent heart disease and 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.100
 different types of cancer then one 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.700
 plant nutrition helps us 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:46.000
 naturally to prevent these 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:49.240
 that is all about the same thing every time 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:53.050
 that there is something that always hurts us 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:56.440
 there is something that is the antidote to give 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:05:00.520
 others to puntillos well this plant 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:02.260
 It is rich in iron and potassium, that is all 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.160
 these infusions or broths that you can 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.500
 do with this plant because they are rich in 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:11.040
 iron and potassium and that I 'm just saying that 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.040
 we are one
