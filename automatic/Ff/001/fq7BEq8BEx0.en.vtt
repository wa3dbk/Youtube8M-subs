key blocks the first of June when you do

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.330 
key blocks the first of June when you do
is<00:00:06.690> gonna<00:00:06.810> take<00:00:07.080> whatever<00:00:07.350> unit<00:00:07.620> last<00:00:07.770> you<00:00:08.160> see

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:16.910 
eyford you how to make this you know
so<00:00:15.030> first<00:00:15.360> what<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.630> have<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.809> do<00:00:15.960> is<00:00:16.500> wake

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
so first what you have to do is wake

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.470 
so first what you have to do is wake
your<00:00:17.039> people<00:00:17.100> right<00:00:17.730> get<00:00:18.119> what<00:00:18.240> you're<00:00:18.390> gonna

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
your people right get what you're gonna

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.920 
your people right get what you're gonna
blast<00:00:18.720> right<00:00:19.650> and<00:00:20.570> it's<00:00:21.570> as<00:00:21.750> simple<00:00:21.930> as

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
blast right and it's as simple as

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.740 
blast right and it's as simple as
putting<00:00:24.930> your<00:00:25.050> hands<00:00:25.260> forward<00:00:25.500> like<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.750> or

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
putting your hands forward like that or

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.070 
putting your hands forward like that or
like<00:00:28.199> that<00:00:29.189> I<00:00:29.670> suggest<00:00:30.240> wait<00:00:30.630> two<00:00:30.929> minutes

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
like that I suggest wait two minutes

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:34.040 
like that I suggest wait two minutes
because<00:00:31.349> when<00:00:31.890> you<00:00:31.980> do<00:00:32.160> one<00:00:32.430> hand<00:00:32.809> some<00:00:33.809> keys

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
because when you do one hand some keys

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.750 
because when you do one hand some keys
still<00:00:34.320> locked<00:00:34.500> back<00:00:34.739> in<00:00:35.100> this<00:00:35.250> hand<00:00:36.980> I<00:00:37.980> just

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
still locked back in this hand I just

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.639 
still locked back in this hand I just
suggest<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:40.700> ice<00:00:41.700> is<00:00:41.879> just<00:00:41.910> too<00:00:42.870> much<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
suggest the ice is just too much so the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.100 
suggest the ice is just too much so the
last<00:00:43.860> have<00:00:44.390> but<00:00:45.390> when<00:00:46.079> you<00:00:46.680> must<00:00:47.010> look

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
last have but when you must look

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.580 
last have but when you must look
whatever<00:00:49.110> you<00:00:49.410> an<00:00:49.469> advanced<00:00:49.950> it's<00:00:51.590> costing

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
whatever you an advanced it's costing

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.740 
whatever you an advanced it's costing
people<00:00:52.980> just<00:00:53.699> know<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:56.030> it's<00:00:57.030> not<00:00:57.239> wind

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
people just know that it's not wind

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.130 
people just know that it's not wind
hey<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.260> not<00:00:58.410> windy<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.219> would<00:00:59.399> wait<00:01:00.140> you

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
I'll show you a difference right now

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.480 
I'll show you a difference right now
okay<00:01:07.979> this<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.490> me<00:01:08.670> not<00:01:09.420> doing<00:01:13.220> seems<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.369> little

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
okay this is me not doing seems a little

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.109 
okay this is me not doing seems a little
bit<00:01:14.900> it<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.140> because<00:01:16.890> there<00:01:17.159> is<00:01:17.430> some<00:01:17.729> would<00:01:17.909> be

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
bit it is because there is some would be

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.080 
bit it is because there is some would be
created<00:01:18.509> one<00:01:18.689> of<00:01:18.869> your<00:01:19.049> hands

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:27.770 

but<00:01:22.719> didn't<00:01:22.990> make<00:01:23.200> the<00:01:23.439> key<00:01:23.619> ball<00:01:26.100> see<00:01:27.100> there's

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
but didn't make the key ball see there's

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:39.929 
but didn't make the key ball see there's
this<00:01:28.780> difference<00:01:34.079> wouldn't<00:01:38.429> see<00:01:39.429> ad<00:01:39.640> to

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:39.939 
this difference wouldn't see ad to

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:41.520 
this difference wouldn't see ad to
create<00:01:40.390> a<00:01:40.420> lot<00:01:40.630> of<00:01:40.719> wind<00:01:40.899> for<00:01:41.140> that<00:01:41.259> to<00:01:41.380> roll

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
create a lot of wind for that to roll

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:44.639 
create a lot of wind for that to roll
down<00:01:42.209> but<00:01:43.209> if<00:01:43.299> I<00:01:43.420> just<00:01:43.600> make<00:01:43.810> one<00:01:43.990> sink<00:01:44.229> a<00:01:44.469> ball

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
down but if I just make one sink a ball

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:48.469 
down but if I just make one sink a ball
it's<00:01:44.859> just<00:01:45.069> one<00:01:45.250> simply<00:01:46.920> once<00:01:47.920> it's<00:01:48.130> at<00:01:48.219> last

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
it's just one simply once it's at last

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.859 
it's just one simply once it's at last
know<00:01:49.479> this<00:01:50.439> when<00:01:50.799> you<00:01:51.329> do<00:01:52.329> that<00:01:52.509> when<00:01:52.810> you

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
know this when you do that when you

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:54.990 
know this when you do that when you
blast<00:01:53.170> your<00:01:53.319> energy<00:01:53.799> you're<00:01:54.520> gonna<00:01:54.640> want<00:01:54.909> to

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
blast your energy you're gonna want to

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.779 
blast your energy you're gonna want to
flex<00:01:55.509> your<00:01:55.689> hands<00:01:56.200> and<00:01:56.860> throw<00:01:57.250> as<00:01:57.399> much<00:01:57.549> can
