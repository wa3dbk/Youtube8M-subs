better results are going to get these
things<00:01:10.670> are<00:01:10.850> more<00:01:11.090> stable<00:01:11.360> you<00:01:11.990> can<00:01:12.140> fly<00:01:12.350> them

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
things are more stable you can fly them

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.860 
things are more stable you can fly them
higher<00:01:12.710> and<00:01:12.979> further<00:01:13.580> away<00:01:13.820> because<00:01:14.120> they're

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:14.870 
higher and further away because they're

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.740 
higher and further away because they're
bigger<00:01:15.140> they're<00:01:15.380> easier<00:01:15.740> to<00:01:15.800> see<00:01:16.130> and<00:01:17.090> these

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
bigger they're easier to see and these

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.600 
bigger they're easier to see and these
days<00:01:18.020> the<00:01:18.560> prices<00:01:18.860> of<00:01:19.159> these<00:01:19.250> things<00:01:19.460> that

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.630 
forward from an HD camera at which time
i'll<00:04:12.870> take<00:04:13.140> this<00:04:13.350> camera<00:04:13.650> and<00:04:13.980> turn<00:04:14.430> it<00:04:14.550> around

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
i'll take this camera and turn it around

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.900 
i'll take this camera and turn it around
so<00:04:14.970> it<00:04:15.120> faces<00:04:15.269> backwards<00:04:16.310> but<00:04:17.310> this<00:04:17.549> mountain

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
so it faces backwards but this mountain

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.840 
so it faces backwards but this mountain
was<00:04:17.970> just<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.329> quick<00:04:18.600> amount<00:04:18.810> i<00:04:19.019> made<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:20.340> as

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
was just a quick amount i made and as

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.610 
was just a quick amount i made and as
you<00:04:21.030> can<00:04:21.180> tell<00:04:21.209> it's<00:04:21.510> got<00:04:21.630> no<00:04:21.930> vibration

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
you can tell it's got no vibration

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.800 
you can tell it's got no vibration
dampening<00:04:23.100> and<00:04:23.310> i've<00:04:24.240> been<00:04:24.390> able<00:04:24.510> to<00:04:24.720> get

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
dampening and i've been able to get

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.100 
dampening and i've been able to get
pretty<00:04:25.470> good<00:04:25.560> results<00:04:26.419> now<00:04:27.419> i'm<00:04:27.720> going<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:27.960> be

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.110 
pretty good results now i'm going to be

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:31.070 
pretty good results now i'm going to be
adding<00:04:28.860> some<00:04:29.190> vibration<00:04:29.910> damping<00:04:30.300> the<00:04:30.690> even

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
adding some vibration damping the even

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.200 
adding some vibration damping the even
better<00:04:31.260> results<00:04:31.470> but<00:04:32.340> i<00:04:32.370> did<00:04:32.669> want<00:04:32.700> it<00:04:32.970> i<00:04:33.150> just

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
better results but i did want it i just

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.050 
better results but i did want it i just
did<00:04:33.570> some<00:04:33.780> testing<00:04:33.810> just<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.560> see<00:04:34.770> you<00:04:35.669> know<00:04:35.700> if

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
did some testing just to see you know if

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.460 
did some testing just to see you know if
you<00:04:36.150> get<00:04:36.270> it<00:04:36.419> as<00:04:36.690> good<00:04:36.990> as<00:04:37.080> I<00:04:37.139> can<00:04:37.260> get<00:04:37.410> it

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.470 
you get it as good as I can get it

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.950 
you get it as good as I can get it
without<00:04:38.070> the<00:04:38.310> vibration<00:04:38.880> dampening<00:04:39.240> so<00:04:39.810> that

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
without the vibration dampening so that

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.810 
without the vibration dampening so that
means<00:04:40.229> hopefully<00:04:40.530> with<00:04:40.860> any<00:04:41.010> luck<00:04:41.280> when<00:04:41.669> I<00:04:41.729> do

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
means hopefully with any luck when I do

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.730 
means hopefully with any luck when I do
it<00:04:42.030> at<00:04:42.120> the<00:04:42.180> vibration<00:04:42.660> dampening<00:04:42.990> should<00:04:43.590> get

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
it at the vibration dampening should get

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.969 
it at the vibration dampening should get
some<00:04:43.950> really<00:04:44.490> good<00:04:44.640> video<00:04:45.290> um<00:04:46.290> but<00:04:46.650> anyways

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
some really good video um but anyways

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.110 
some really good video um but anyways
like<00:04:47.130> I<00:04:47.220> said<00:04:47.340> I<00:04:47.370> just<00:04:47.400> want<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.790> show<00:04:47.910> you<00:04:48.000> this

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
like I said I just want to show you this

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.260 
like I said I just want to show you this
real<00:04:48.330> quick<00:04:48.540> and<00:04:49.700> you<00:04:50.700> know<00:04:50.850> if<00:04:51.030> you're<00:04:51.180> gonna

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
real quick and you know if you're gonna

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.469 
real quick and you know if you're gonna
build<00:04:52.260> your<00:04:52.440> own<00:04:52.470> this<00:04:52.979> might<00:04:53.250> be<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.940> place

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
build your own this might be the place

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.340 
build your own this might be the place
to<00:04:54.600> start<00:04:55.020> for<00:04:55.289> you<00:04:55.590> maybe<00:04:56.419> but<00:04:57.419> anyways<00:04:58.140> I

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
to start for you maybe but anyways I

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.870 
to start for you maybe but anyways I
hope<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:58.860> enjoyed<00:04:59.160> the<00:04:59.190> video<00:04:59.400> and<00:04:59.640> I<00:04:59.820> will

00:04:59.870 --> 00:04:59.880 
hope you enjoyed the video and I will

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.360 
hope you enjoyed the video and I will
talk<00:05:00.060> to<00:05:00.180> you<00:05:00.240> guys<00:05:00.270> later
