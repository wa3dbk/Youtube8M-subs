00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 Today is the third day of the rally race! We are on the track, next to the start 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.000
 And we see that the team "Kamaz" has already started the third stage! 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.000
 The track has prepared a lot of surprises for the participants! Complex navigation, winding roads and dunes 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.000
 As the participants will have to shine, but we will follow it! 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
 Raimond's story as a "Reautoclub" team took the third step? 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 This was a tough phase, the machine drove 270 km! Sadly, Alexander Terentev left the race 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 In his class he fought for the first place! 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:10.000
 I'm glad the Finnish crew, they showed great results 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:31.000
 We are still developing the machine. We have a new goal, a new car in every race 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
 The result is good, today our first team came first 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:47.000
 Unfortunately, Kolembets has left the competition for technical reasons, but it is going to happen and we will continue to fight! 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
 The helmsman is talking to me today, because I have cut off the road all the time and not where I need it 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.000
 So I got tired, but in general everything is fine 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:29.000
 Sergey tried to find the shortest way! We found it a few times but the road was very difficult 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 The road consisted of two stages - either very fast, because I never drove so fast 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:08.000
 Or it is very slow to get tired of pits and jumps, even a few times 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.000
 We really competed! I swear! 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.000
 Now we are in a service park where Reautoclub mechanics check the machines. 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:28.000
 Whale, tell me where the machine is in 270 kilometers? 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:44.000
 The condition of the machine is relatively good considering the small problems. A little broken bumper 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 But thanks to the skill of the pilots, they successfully finished 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 I'm happy that we reached the finish 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:28.000
 There was a lot of sand dunes, there were pits on the track and big drops 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000
 But we dealt with it 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.000
 Tomorrow will be a very important day, so you will have to go to bed faster this evening 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000
 Yes, I'll go!
