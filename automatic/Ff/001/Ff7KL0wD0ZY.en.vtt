00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 hi everyone this kof mango 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.279
 I hope you are doing well today 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.189
 I present you a guide on the cw 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.650
 ar it's a engineers weapon that can 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.650
 to be unlocked by completing the mission 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.890
 problem solved by obviously possessing 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.980
 claude squatters so it's a mission 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.199
 who ask to make 20 that he will have 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.640
 quest either with a rpg a stinger a 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.680
 white jeans that these lands all that 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.320
 can fire a rocket and 30 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.019
 disposal with a rifle so a 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.669
 engineers weapon the CW hours is a 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.860
 weapon that is available since the month 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.040
 of June 2012 so at the end of the pack 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.450
 water clause was not that it's a 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.250
 weapon that I did not really have much 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.320
 used I had it unlocked I had it 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.539
 set aside because of these statistics 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.969
 a bit peculiar except that with the 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.239
 availability now from haft e marty 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:53.850
 their rate of the engineer class finally 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.520
 of the utility of the engineer class I 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.379
 think it's a weapon that can be 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.629
 very very useful there are a lot of 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.940
 players who is currently playing it on the 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.400
 tomato and I think it's a weapon 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:10.170
 which very well adapted to this format 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.040
 average map that is presented in 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.430
 after mat 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.200
 at the level of the characteristics the cw aof 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.479
 an automatic firing mode and blow by 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.070
 blow a loader of 26 balls plus a 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.680
 ball in the barrel so here we go 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.439
 account that those chargers that smaller 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:28.130
 that normal engineer's weapons a 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.750
 super fast loading time with 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.200
 1.85 its range with a charger not city 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.450
 and 2.5 seconds with an empty charger and 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.250
 a range of 750 meters which is a 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.070
 very good range for a weapon 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.119
 of engineers the cw yesterday will stand out 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.070
 compared to others make 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.899
 of engineers by its damage model 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.509
 which is quite particular so we speak 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.939
 20 of damage within 1000 miles and 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.920
 16 points 7 to more than 50 meters 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.159
 normally a engineers weapon is going 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.530
 do 25 damage to lesser humanity 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.479
 14.3 to more than 50 miles this model of 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.520
 damage will allow the cw is to be 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:04.560
 more effective at medium and long range 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.840
 if we compare it for example 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.580
 with the n 4 has one who is the soul of 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.580
 reference at the class level 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:15.000
 engineer the cw started to be 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.150
 more effective from 40 m 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.810
 so from 40 m the cw gets to 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.849
 do more damage than the m14 and will 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.060
 also kill faster 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:29.700
 so really you have to remember that the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.980
 cw air and a weapon that will be effective 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.349
 at medium and long range 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.480
 another element that brings the cw yesterday 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.670
 Use a medium and long 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.440
 litter is its dispersion with bluefin tuna 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.140
 and so it's a dispersion that's 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.840
 high so that's another element that 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.430
 fact that the cw ar is not 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.400
 necessarily a weapon that is going to be very 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.540
 very effective in melee and in 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.310
 close combat 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.340
 on the other hand, it has a cadence of 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.290
 very high with 850 strokes per minute is 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.720
 the second plus of 10 years of an awesome 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.010
 am late having the first position with 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.769
 9 cents a minute 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.870
 also you have a dispersion of 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.970
 bullets that is weak when you aim 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.790
 so if you have it said aim the 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.130
 dispersion will be very very weak more 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.010
 low than the average of the Andes 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.590
 engineers also the recoil that makes 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.690
 so you really have a weapon that goes 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.980
 to be very very effective at medium and 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.040
 long range to kill enemies 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.420
 quickly with a slight decline 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:30.660
 a thing that is interesting with 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.329
 the aso wrc its constancy at the level of the 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.489
 number of bullets to kill an enemy seen 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:38.340
 that his disgust minimum they are guys 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:41.010
 up are very very very became 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.630
 that you always have a constancy at 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.160
 level of the number of bullets to kill a 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.650
 enemy ie they know how to vary 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:48.900
 between 5 and 6 balls no matter the 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.299
 distance so this is an element that is 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.920
 interesting to keep a good pace 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.290
 because you know how many balls 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.920
 exactly he'll have to kill a 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.660
 enemy 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.400
 if you want to play the role of 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.010
 the stealth engineer I advise you 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.049
 to really use the air cw with the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.940
 silent and the handle you go 

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.319
 have practically laser hands 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.299
 so much lambres given stable 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.739
 also you can work around 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.959
 enemy lines approached him 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.570
 with the muffler that will allow you 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:18.370
 to stay invisible on the mini map 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.829
 however, if you plan to use the 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.169
 CW hours to medium and long range I 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.090
 advise you to be the only one 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:25.570
 heavy cannon with a blizzard of your 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.820
 choice 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.770
 as we saw the basic statistics 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.949
 of lambres are very very interesting 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.810
 for medium and long range with the 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:37.360
 cannon the water you go more 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.720
 increase your chances of killing an enemy 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:42.550
 which is in the shadow is 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.650
 obviously you will be able to kill him 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.360
 quickly as we saw because of the 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.340
 damage model of the c w is required 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.810
 really suited for long-range 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:54.430
 so it's not already done I you 

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.560
 really advise to go throw a shot 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.470
 look at the cw which is a weapon that is 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.340
 very very interesting and very effective 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.919
 obviously it depends on the circumstances 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:05.199
 and situations if you are in combat 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.530
 close up probably that the m 80 is going 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:10.720
 to be more efficient than the cw yesterday but 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.550
 it remains that it is a weapon to try it 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.669
 must see is a shadow that can you 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.289
 agree I think l that to be very 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.389
 very effective and tomorrow it takes 

00:05:17.289 --> 00:05:21.909
 use it under the right circumstances 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.220
 that completes this guide on cw 

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:25.900
 I invite you to visit my channel and 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.030
 subscribe is not already done I you 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.430
 thanks for listening to the videos and 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:34.289
 on this I tell you to the next good 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.289
 day and we'll talk soon lease
