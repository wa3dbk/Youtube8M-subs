go money on the paddle bar here of
Bobby's<00:02:48.490> bike<00:02:49.090> there's<00:02:49.900> a<00:02:50.290> light<00:02:50.650> with<00:02:51.250> a

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
Bobby's bike there's a light with a

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.900 
Bobby's bike there's a light with a
attached<00:02:52.270> solar<00:02:52.660> panel<00:02:53.290> and<00:02:53.550> it's<00:02:54.550> going<00:02:54.820> to

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
attached solar panel and it's going to

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.270 
attached solar panel and it's going to
it's<00:02:55.480> going<00:02:55.660> to<00:02:56.140> light<00:02:56.380> up<00:02:56.530> this<00:02:56.740> red<00:02:57.040> light

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
it's going to light up this red light

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
it's going to light up this red light
all<00:02:57.520> by<00:02:57.730> itself<00:02:58.830> just<00:02:59.830> because<00:03:00.580> it's<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.910> solar

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
all by itself just because it's a solar

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.810 
all by itself just because it's a solar
panel<00:03:01.600> and<00:03:01.930> then<00:03:02.140> there's<00:03:02.350> a<00:03:02.620> white<00:03:03.520> light

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
panel and then there's a white light

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.630 
panel and then there's a white light
here<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.960> is<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.200> this<00:03:05.500> is<00:03:05.830> a<00:03:06.010> lot<00:03:06.190> like<00:03:06.400> this

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
here this is a this is a lot like this

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.150 
here this is a this is a lot like this
one<00:03:06.700> there's<00:03:07.540> a<00:03:07.630> solar<00:03:07.930> panel<00:03:08.230> on<00:03:08.530> top<00:03:08.590> of<00:03:09.010> that

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.160 
one there's a solar panel on top of that

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.450 
one there's a solar panel on top of that
so<00:03:09.880> that<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.870> that's<00:03:11.230> going<00:03:11.500> to<00:03:11.590> light<00:03:12.100> up<00:03:12.280> by

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:12.460 
so that it that's going to light up by

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.730 
so that it that's going to light up by
itself<00:03:12.820> too<00:03:13.180> personally<00:03:14.020> I<00:03:14.080> think<00:03:14.350> this<00:03:14.530> is

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
itself too personally I think this is

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.680 
itself too personally I think this is
well<00:03:14.950> mounted<00:03:15.460> and<00:03:15.640> this<00:03:15.760> is<00:03:15.910> useless<00:03:16.270> but

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
well mounted and this is useless but

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.170 
well mounted and this is useless but
such<00:03:16.960> is<00:03:16.990> life
