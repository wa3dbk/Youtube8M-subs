pastry<00:01:42.670> brush<00:01:42.880> just<00:01:43.210> to<00:01:43.300> run<00:01:43.600> it<00:01:43.690> down<00:01:43.720> one

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
pastry brush just to run it down one

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.140 
pastry brush just to run it down one
side<00:01:44.380> it's<00:01:44.830> basically<00:01:45.130> just<00:01:45.250> acts<00:01:45.460> like<00:01:45.640> glue

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
side it's basically just acts like glue

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.390 
side it's basically just acts like glue
okay<00:01:46.570> fold<00:01:46.930> over<00:01:47.140> the<00:01:47.409> side<00:01:47.620> without<00:01:48.040> the<00:01:48.250> egg

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
okay fold over the side without the egg

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.610 
okay fold over the side without the egg
and<00:01:48.640> then<00:01:48.820> just<00:01:49.060> keep<00:01:49.270> rolling<00:01:49.780> and<00:01:49.930> then<00:01:50.409> make

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:50.620 
and then just keep rolling and then make

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:52.140 
and then just keep rolling and then make
sure<00:01:50.650> the<00:01:50.860> scene<00:01:51.190> is<00:01:51.220> underneath<00:01:51.850> because
