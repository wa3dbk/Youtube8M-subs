00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.480
 welcome to the next table today we 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:13.930
 talk about two systems that we can 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.289
 the respiratory and circulatory system 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:19.660
 Let's start with breathing, you know. 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:23.410
 as that happens the breath of a 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.030
 der team in good modern osec are 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.250
 Marine animals 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:31.390
 so we can imagine that these 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:34.210
 animals breathe through franchises 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:37.450
 only the white of the modern cec 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:40.660
 staff are still very rudimentary are 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.810
 very simple as we have already seen the 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.730
 are projections from the surface of the 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.579
 body of the animal and they are very 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:52.420
 efficient in gas exchange because 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:56.470
 they can absorb the oxygen they 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:01:00.220
 is in the middle that is there at sea and 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:03.489
 the other side eliminates the carbon dioxide that is 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.189
 a by-product of cellular respiration 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.220
 but let's see here how these 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.600
 in three different classes of the 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.810
 cec modern 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.780
 the first is the asteroid class idea and 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.820
 who is part of that same good class 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.030
 In this class we have the famous ones. 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:25.869
 stars of the bar the stars of the sea 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.830
 people have papules but what is 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:31.720
 that 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:35.560
 good papules are wall projections 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.710
 of the body are usually between the 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.760
 thorns and here inside the tables 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:44.740
 there are extensions of the 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.909
 breast seal cavity 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.630
 as we have already seen the sealed one is that 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:55.229
 cavity filled with fluid and that it 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.170
 have an importance in breathing 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.210
 through the papules the gasol this genius 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.880
 who is in the middle can be 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.880
 absorbed the oxygen will be 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.929
 transported here by diffusion to these 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:14.050
 moon stamp branches and then goes 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.720
 be transported through the 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.290
 in this liquid for the whole body of the 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.680
 animal 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.170
 contrary to the carbon dioxide that has been 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.019
 produced by the cellular respiration also 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:30.890
 goes here on the cell phone and through 

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:32.209
 of the papules will be eliminated for the 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.819
 environment 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:37.640
 and this personal transport only happens 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.310
 because here there is a difference of 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.640
 gas concentrations 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:47.450
 for example here in the external environment there exists 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.689
 higher concentration of oxygen and is 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.560
 so that oxygen tends to come in 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:57.500
 papules reminiscent of diffusion is a 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.230
 transport that happens in favor of 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.319
 concentration gradient and with gas 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.709
 Carbonic the opposite happens the middle 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:10.129
 animal is more concentrated gas 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.739
 then it tends to go out into the 

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.079
 external environment 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:18.200
 now let's think of another class to 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.700
 class and that our idea and who does 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.180
 part of this class 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.750
 the sea urchins osores personal possess 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:30.829
 which are located externally 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:35.449
 well these whites are located here and 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:38.659
 externally around the mouth as I have already 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:39.669
 I spoke are surface projections 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.590
 corporal 

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:45.799
 then here are represented the 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.720
 whites and certain species of 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:51.889
 Hedgehogs can have up to ten whites 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.769
 surrounding the mouth 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:58.340
 these white people can absorb the 

00:03:54.769 --> 00:04:03.169
 oxygen that is in the middle and eliminate the 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.340
 carbon dioxide and to finish the system 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.099
 respiratory 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.530
 Let's see how the breath of a 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:13.430
 sea â€‹â€‹cucumber being of class 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.489
 he filled the idea in this personal case 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:19.400
 large are internal white 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.949
 only they will be year and stay and they will 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.409
 form what we call a tree 

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:28.010
 respiratory 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:31.310
 so here is represented the tree 

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.060
 breathing that is nothing more than a 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:37.370
 set 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:40.820
 the branched white tree 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:44.180
 respiratory system can also absorb the 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.740
 oxygen that is in the middle and eliminate 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:48.980
 carbon dioxide 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:52.220
 then the respiratory system personnel is 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.570
 responsible for gas exchange 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.120
 but when these cats are 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:59.870
 transported in the body of the animal 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:03.860
 Good as I already said the gases are 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:06.520
 transported through the breast seal 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:10.760
 then the personal the circulatory system 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:14.620
 of the modern cec is reduced who 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:18.100
 performs the transport function of 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:20.930
 substances is in fact the 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:23.780
 various substances such as 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.200
 gases are transported from the 

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:28.010
 diffusion occurring in the fresh liquid 

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.280
 loma 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:34.070
 and then people and lomba do not transport 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.169
 only gases like we just saw 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:39.770
 it also carries nutrients 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.890
 discreet 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.660
 then it is a very important structure 

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.419
 to say that we can not 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:48.289
 We finished here and I hope you have 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:50.240
 understood 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:54.410
 Next class we will talk about the 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.590
 excretory and nervous system do not lose until 

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.590
 over there
