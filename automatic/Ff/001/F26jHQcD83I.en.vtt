looked<00:03:29.069> very<00:03:29.280> different<00:03:29.519> bananas<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.420> many

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
looked very different bananas and many

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.640 
looked very different bananas and many
people<00:03:30.720> may<00:03:30.989> not<00:03:31.140> know<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.350> were

years<00:03:33.870> ago<00:03:34.140> most<00:03:34.739> likely<00:03:34.980> by<00:03:35.280> some<00:03:35.579> people<00:03:35.910> in

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
years ago most likely by some people in

Papua<00:03:36.450> New<00:03:36.480> Guinea<00:03:36.810> wild<00:03:37.620> bananas<00:03:38.100> look

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
Papua New Guinea wild bananas look

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.640 
Papua New Guinea wild bananas look
completely<00:03:39.120> different<00:03:39.239> they<00:03:39.930> have<00:03:40.079> none<00:03:40.440> of

through farming through domestication

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.380

over<00:04:21.570> thousands<00:04:22.200> of<00:04:22.289> years<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:23.340> why<00:04:23.729> but<00:04:24.090> if<00:04:24.210> by

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
over thousands of years so why but if by

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.120 
over thousands of years so why but if by
God<00:04:24.690> he<00:04:24.930> means<00:04:25.140> the<00:04:25.349> people<00:04:25.530> in<00:04:25.770> Papua<00:04:26.099> New

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
God he means the people in Papua New

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.050 
God he means the people in Papua New
Guinea<00:04:26.430> the

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:27.060 
Guinea the

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.650 
Guinea the
domesticated<00:04:27.690> the<00:04:27.720> banana<00:04:28.310> maybe<00:04:29.510> maybe<00:04:30.510> i

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
domesticated the banana maybe maybe i

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.690 
domesticated the banana maybe maybe i
would<00:04:30.840> agree<00:04:30.930> also<00:04:31.380> bananas<00:04:32.040> don't<00:04:32.250> turn

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
would agree also bananas don't turn

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.420 
would agree also bananas don't turn
yellow<00:04:33.120> normally<00:04:33.750> in<00:04:33.960> the<00:04:34.139> wild<00:04:34.560> they<00:04:35.040> usually

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
yellow normally in the wild they usually

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.040 
yellow normally in the wild they usually
stay<00:04:35.669> pretty<00:04:35.940> green<00:04:36.240> because<00:04:36.750> they<00:04:36.870> turn

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
stay pretty green because they turn

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.330 
stay pretty green because they turn
yellow<00:04:37.260> because<00:04:37.500> they're<00:04:37.680> sprayed<00:04:37.950> with<00:04:38.160> the

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:38.340 
yellow because they're sprayed with the

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.040 
yellow because they're sprayed with the
some<00:04:38.790> type<00:04:38.940> of<00:04:39.000> chemical<00:04:39.360> or<00:04:39.690> some<00:04:39.870> type<00:04:40.020> of

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
some type of chemical or some type of

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.080 
some type of chemical or some type of
compound<00:04:40.500> that<00:04:40.710> that<00:04:41.310> makes<00:04:41.490> them<00:04:41.669> turn<00:04:41.820> more

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
compound that that makes them turn more

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.970 
compound that that makes them turn more
yellow<00:04:42.330> is<00:04:42.720> that<00:04:42.900> a<00:04:42.930> fact<00:04:43.169> that<00:04:43.260> has<00:04:43.470> a<00:04:43.530> ripens

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
yellow is that a fact that has a ripens

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:45.440 
yellow is that a fact that has a ripens
yeah<00:04:44.190> well<00:04:44.550> it<00:04:44.730> right<00:04:44.940> other<00:04:45.120> one<00:04:45.300> of<00:04:45.389> the

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
yeah well it right other one of the

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.000 
yeah well it right other one of the
things<00:04:45.660> he<00:04:45.780> says<00:04:45.990> is<00:04:46.110> that<00:04:46.139> has<00:04:46.410> a<00:04:46.440> natural

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
things he says is that has a natural

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.580 
things he says is that has a natural
indicator<00:04:47.520> of<00:04:47.610> green<00:04:48.180> it's<00:04:48.510> not<00:04:48.720> ready<00:04:49.050> yellow

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
indicator of green it's not ready yellow

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:52.010 
indicator of green it's not ready yellow
it's<00:04:49.830> ready<00:04:50.100> black<00:04:50.700> you<00:04:51.120> waited<00:04:51.450> too<00:04:51.600> long<00:04:51.780> so

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
it's ready black you waited too long so

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.420 
it's ready black you waited too long so
you're<00:04:52.169> saying<00:04:52.410> even<00:04:52.710> part<00:04:52.950> of<00:04:53.070> how<00:04:53.220> you<00:04:53.250> I

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
you're saying even part of how you I

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.430 
you're saying even part of how you I
think<00:04:53.730> that<00:04:53.880> do<00:04:54.000> bananas<00:04:54.450> do<00:04:54.600> turn<00:04:54.870> somewhat

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
think that do bananas do turn somewhat

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:57.379 
think that do bananas do turn somewhat
yellow<00:04:55.650> but<00:04:55.950> probably<00:04:56.340> not<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.820> mean<00:04:57.240> this

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
yellow but probably not I mean this

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.260 
yellow but probably not I mean this
thing<00:04:57.600> is<00:04:57.630> almost<00:04:58.050> completely<00:04:58.919> yellow<00:04:59.370> right

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:00.270 
thing is almost completely yellow right

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.850 
thing is almost completely yellow right
aamir<00:05:00.900> banana<00:05:01.169> would<00:05:01.350> never<00:05:01.500> look<00:05:01.650> like<00:05:01.710> that

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 
aamir banana would never look like that

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.310 
aamir banana would never look like that
in<00:05:02.070> the<00:05:02.160> wild<00:05:02.460> all<00:05:02.639> of<00:05:02.970> this<00:05:03.150> is<00:05:03.450> evolution<00:05:04.200> the

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:04.320 
in the wild all of this is evolution the

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.620 
in the wild all of this is evolution the
same<00:05:04.560> evolution<00:05:05.220> that<00:05:05.460> he<00:05:05.760> says<00:05:06.030> doesn't

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.630 
same evolution that he says doesn't

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.110 
same evolution that he says doesn't
exist<00:05:06.690> that<00:05:07.350> simply<00:05:07.800> doesn't<00:05:07.979> exist<00:05:08.160> okay<00:05:08.700> so

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
exist that simply doesn't exist okay so

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.090 
exist that simply doesn't exist okay so

many hoaxes of evolutionary theory while

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.629 
many hoaxes of evolutionary theory while
presenting<00:06:10.020> a<00:06:10.380> balanced<00:06:11.160> view<00:06:11.430> of

00:06:11.629 --> 00:06:11.639 
presenting a balanced view of

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:13.620 
creationism and part of that balance

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.800 
creationism and part of that balance
would<00:06:13.770> be<00:06:13.800> that<00:06:14.490> God<00:06:14.700> created<00:06:15.120> this<00:06:15.419> because

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
would be that God created this because

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:17.659 
would be that God created this because
it<00:06:15.960> fits<00:06:16.169> into<00:06:16.320> people's<00:06:16.710> hands<00:06:16.950> this<00:06:17.280> banana

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:17.669 
it fits into people's hands this banana

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:22.129 
it fits into people's hands this banana
for<00:06:18.000> that's<00:06:18.240> part<00:06:18.570> of<00:06:18.690> it<00:06:19.850> so<00:06:20.850> the<00:06:21.389> logic<00:06:22.110> here

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 
for that's part of it so the logic here

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:24.680 
for that's part of it so the logic here
is<00:06:22.530> this<00:06:23.490> is<00:06:23.550> the<00:06:23.789> only<00:06:23.880> logic<00:06:24.330> I<00:06:24.419> could<00:06:24.570> think

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
is this is the only logic I could think

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:27.590 
is this is the only logic I could think
of<00:06:24.870> because<00:06:25.710> Hitler<00:06:26.160> used<00:06:26.490> evolution<00:06:26.850> as<00:06:27.330> part

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
of because Hitler used evolution as part

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.719 
of because Hitler used evolution as part
of<00:06:27.660> his<00:06:27.780> evil<00:06:28.080> plan<00:06:28.380> meaning<00:06:28.919> he<00:06:29.160> knew<00:06:29.400> that<00:06:29.639> if

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
of his evil plan meaning he knew that if

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.520 
of his evil plan meaning he knew that if
he<00:06:29.760> killed<00:06:30.180> people<00:06:30.270> he<00:06:30.720> didn't<00:06:30.960> like<00:06:31.200> the

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:31.530 
he killed people he didn't like the

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.770 
he killed people he didn't like the
people<00:06:32.520> that<00:06:32.669> were<00:06:32.789> left<00:06:33.030> because<00:06:33.750> of

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:33.780 
people that were left because of

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.310 
people that were left because of
evolution<00:06:34.560> would<00:06:35.310> create<00:06:35.750> more<00:06:36.750> people<00:06:37.200> that

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:37.320 
evolution would create more people that

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:39.170 
evolution would create more people that
look<00:06:37.500> like<00:06:37.530> them<00:06:37.710> right<00:06:38.280> Hitler<00:06:38.820> used

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
look like them right Hitler used

but<00:06:40.970> that<00:06:41.120> to<00:06:41.300> me<00:06:41.450> means<00:06:41.810> that<00:06:42.170> somehow

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890

someone<00:06:43.880> who<00:06:44.170> invents<00:06:45.170> a<00:06:45.290> bomb<00:06:45.560> and<00:06:45.950> then

drops it they're complicit with whoever
invented<00:06:49.550> gravity<00:06:49.730> so<00:06:50.390> to<00:06:50.450> speak<00:06:50.720> because<00:06:50.930> hey

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290 
invented gravity so to speak because hey

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.560 
invented gravity so to speak because hey
they<00:06:52.250> needed<00:06:52.580> that<00:06:52.610> gravity<00:06:53.150> to<00:06:53.240> drop<00:06:53.450> the

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:53.570 
they needed that gravity to drop the

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:54.970 
they needed that gravity to drop the
bomb<00:06:53.750> otherwise<00:06:54.140> that<00:06:54.350> bomb<00:06:54.530> would<00:06:54.710> have<00:06:54.800> just

bomb otherwise that bomb would have just

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.760 
bomb otherwise that bomb would have just
sat<00:06:55.160> in<00:06:55.190> space<00:06:55.520> so<00:06:56.510> instead<00:06:57.320> of<00:06:57.380> trying<00:06:57.590> to

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:10.520 
theory right now I don't know for sure

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.190 
theory right now I don't know for sure

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 
they will breed and then that will lead

don't believe that evolution exists hey
let<00:07:35.510> them<00:07:35.600> kill<00:07:35.780> whoever<00:07:36.080> he<00:07:36.170> wants<00:07:36.440> we're
