00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.620 
hype for it has sort of gone down over
time<00:00:21.680> because<00:00:22.400> i'm<00:00:22.610> not<00:00:22.760> sure<00:00:23.030> if<00:00:23.240> these<00:00:23.390> guys

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
time because i'm not sure if these guys

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.810 
time because i'm not sure if these guys
can<00:00:23.690> actually<00:00:24.260> deliver<00:00:24.620> and<00:00:24.980> i've<00:00:25.460> sort<00:00:25.760> of

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:25.820 
can actually deliver and i've sort of

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.400 
can actually deliver and i've sort of
started<00:00:26.240> to<00:00:26.330> become<00:00:26.480> a<00:00:26.690> verse<00:00:27.050> to

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
started to become a verse to

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.160 
started to become a verse to
procedurally<00:00:28.250> generated<00:00:28.280> games<00:00:29.060> at<00:00:29.390> first<00:00:29.960> i

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170 
procedurally generated games at first i

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:31.390 
procedurally generated games at first i
thought<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.530> idea<00:00:30.650> was<00:00:30.860> cool<00:00:31.190> for

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:31.400 
thought the idea was cool for

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.130 
thought the idea was cool for
procedurally<00:00:32.119> generated<00:00:32.149> things<00:00:32.870> but<00:00:33.110> i

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:33.140 
procedurally generated things but i

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.709 
procedurally generated things but i
think<00:00:33.440> i'd<00:00:33.559> rather<00:00:33.590> have<00:00:34.039> something<00:00:34.819> crafted

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
think i'd rather have something crafted

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:37.720 
think i'd rather have something crafted
rather<00:00:35.989> than<00:00:36.199> random<00:00:36.739> it's<00:00:37.219> the<00:00:37.339> same<00:00:37.550> reason

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
rather than random it's the same reason

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.000 
rather than random it's the same reason
i<00:00:37.909> don't<00:00:38.120> really<00:00:38.210> play<00:00:38.510> many<00:00:38.749> roguelikes<00:00:39.409> the

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:40.010 
i don't really play many roguelikes the

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:41.799 
i don't really play many roguelikes the
trailers<00:00:40.429> that<00:00:40.460> have<00:00:40.609> been<00:00:40.819> shown<00:00:41.089> still<00:00:41.539> look

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
trailers that have been shown still look

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.959 
trailers that have been shown still look
incredible<00:00:42.499> and<00:00:42.739> I'm<00:00:42.979> sure<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.219> soundtrack

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
incredible and I'm sure the soundtrack

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:45.520 
incredible and I'm sure the soundtrack
is<00:00:43.999> going<00:00:44.300> to<00:00:44.390> be<00:00:44.479> really<00:00:44.659> good<00:00:44.960> because<00:00:44.989> we've

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
is going to be really good because we've

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.200 
is going to be really good because we've
heard<00:00:45.800> that<00:00:45.829> from<00:00:46.129> the<00:00:46.249> trailers<00:00:46.609> but<00:00:46.940> as<00:00:47.030> far

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
heard that from the trailers but as far

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.239 
heard that from the trailers but as far
as<00:00:47.269> a<00:00:47.389> substance<00:00:48.139> to<00:00:48.350> the<00:00:48.469> game<00:00:48.649> we're<00:00:49.219> not

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:49.249 
as a substance to the game we're not

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.279 
as a substance to the game we're not
really<00:00:49.670> sure<00:00:49.760> yet<00:00:50.239> we'll<00:00:50.719> just<00:00:50.929> have<00:00:51.079> to<00:00:51.170> wait

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
really sure yet we'll just have to wait

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
next is Orion the blind forest I heard

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.980 
next is Orion the blind forest I heard
about<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.160> game<00:02:12.340> from<00:02:12.520> e3<00:02:12.760> last<00:02:13.240> year<00:02:13.570> and<00:02:13.750> is

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
about this game from e3 last year and is

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.170 
about this game from e3 last year and is
a<00:02:14.050> very<00:02:14.350> beautiful<00:02:14.740> looking<00:02:15.310> game<00:02:15.550> and<00:02:15.850> it

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
a very beautiful looking game and it

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.460 
a very beautiful looking game and it
looks<00:02:16.420> like<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.750> might<00:02:16.930> be<00:02:16.960> one<00:02:17.230> of<00:02:17.350> those

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
looks like it might be one of those

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.290 
looks like it might be one of those
emotional<00:02:18.160> games<00:02:18.400> just<00:02:18.790> by<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:18.970> way<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
emotional games just by the way the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.030 
emotional games just by the way the
characters<00:02:19.480> look<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.110> it<00:02:20.230> and<00:02:20.380> from<00:02:20.770> what<00:02:20.950> I've

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
characters look in it and from what I've

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.560 
characters look in it and from what I've
seen<00:02:21.070> of<00:02:21.250> the<00:02:21.430> game<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:21.820> far<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.180> seems<00:02:22.210> like

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:22.570 
seen of the game so far it seems like

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.350 
seen of the game so far it seems like
it'll<00:02:22.750> be<00:02:22.840> a<00:02:22.990> decent<00:02:23.260> platformer<00:02:23.980> as<00:02:24.100> well

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
it'll be a decent platformer as well

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.330 
it'll be a decent platformer as well
next<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:25.480> hyper<00:02:25.780> light<00:02:26.140> drifter<00:02:26.190> this<00:02:27.190> has

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
next is hyper light drifter this has

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.310 
next is hyper light drifter this has
been<00:02:27.370> described<00:02:27.940> as<00:02:28.090> a<00:02:28.150> combination<00:02:28.870> of<00:02:29.020> link

to the past and Diablo and I don't know
about<00:02:31.780> you<00:02:32.050> but<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.350> sounds<00:02:32.770> pretty<00:02:32.950> fun<00:02:33.310> the

that retro Pixley look while still
feeling<00:02:38.920> fresh<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.850> style<00:02:40.180> reminds<00:02:40.660> me<00:02:40.810> a<00:02:40.840> lot

of<00:02:41.140> transistor<00:02:41.950> like<00:02:42.340> this<00:02:42.550> game<00:02:42.730> is<00:02:42.850> what

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
of transistor like this game is what

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.460 
of transistor like this game is what
transistor<00:02:43.540> would<00:02:43.660> look<00:02:43.840> like<00:02:44.020> if<00:02:44.230> it<00:02:44.350> were

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
transistor would look like if it were

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:47.010 
transistor would look like if it were
pixelized<00:02:44.980> and<00:02:45.280> finally<00:02:46.240> in<00:02:46.330> this<00:02:46.510> list<00:02:46.780> is

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
pixelized and finally in this list is

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.410

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
something like that not much has been

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.870 
something like that not much has been
shown<00:02:53.110> of<00:02:53.230> this<00:02:53.380> other<00:02:53.650> than<00:02:53.740> one<00:02:54.280> trailer<00:02:54.700> and

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
a one little gameplay test at least

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.980 
a one little gameplay test at least
that's<00:02:57.070> what<00:02:57.400> I've<00:02:57.520> found<00:02:57.550> it's<00:02:58.360> a<00:02:58.420> platformer

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
that's what I've found it's a platformer

silent cartoons not only do they have
the<00:03:03.220> look<00:03:03.460> down<00:03:03.730> but<00:03:04.000> they<00:03:04.090> had<00:03:04.300> the<00:03:04.450> movement

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960
