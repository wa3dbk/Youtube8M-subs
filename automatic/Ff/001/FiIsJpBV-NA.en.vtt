00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.179 

so<00:02:22.010> hypothetically<00:02:22.189> I<00:02:23.739> slapped<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.829> legs<00:02:25.040> on

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:25.189 
so hypothetically I slapped the legs on

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.059 
so hypothetically I slapped the legs on
that<00:02:25.219> sucker<00:02:26.349> you<00:02:27.349> should<00:02:27.560> be<00:02:27.650> able<00:02:27.739> to<00:02:27.890> walk

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
that sucker you should be able to walk

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.390 
that sucker you should be able to walk
and<00:02:28.310> steer

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:41.630 

cool

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.770 

maybe<00:02:42.640> I<00:02:42.670> should<00:02:42.819> put<00:02:42.940> an<00:02:43.030> extra<00:02:43.269> motor<00:02:43.510> on<00:02:43.690> the

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
maybe I should put an extra motor on the

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.119 
maybe I should put an extra motor on the
steering<00:02:44.700> just<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.849> increase<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.330> chances<00:02:46.690> of

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
steering just to increase the chances of

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:52.710 
steering just to increase the chances of
successful<00:02:48.870> super<00:02:49.870> test<00:02:50.050> drives<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.720> then

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
successful super test drives and then

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.680 
successful super test drives and then
all<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.110> need<00:02:53.349> is<00:02:53.530> some<00:02:54.190> kind<00:02:54.459> of<00:02:54.690> control

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
all I need is some kind of control

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:04.000 
all I need is some kind of control
system<00:02:56.140> and<00:02:56.349> some<00:02:56.560> batteries<00:03:00.330> cool

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:10.059 

and<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:05.120> place<00:03:05.390> to<00:03:05.629> test<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:08.860> for<00:03:09.860> a<00:03:09.920> moment

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
and the place to test it for a moment

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:15.039 
and the place to test it for a moment
I'm<00:03:11.060> gonna<00:03:11.180> go<00:03:11.299> do<00:03:11.420> something<00:03:11.659> else<00:03:13.810> there<00:03:14.810> is

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
I'm gonna go do something else there is

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.490 
I'm gonna go do something else there is
a<00:03:15.200> Maker<00:03:15.769> Faire<00:03:16.480> an<00:03:17.480> hour<00:03:17.780> away

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
a Maker Faire an hour away

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.710 
a Maker Faire an hour away
coming<00:03:18.890> up<00:03:19.010> kind<00:03:19.819> of<00:03:20.000> soon<00:03:24.700> all<00:03:25.700> right<00:03:25.760> just<00:03:26.569> to

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
coming up kind of soon all right just to

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.500 
coming up kind of soon all right just to
be<00:03:26.750> safe<00:03:27.110> let's<00:03:27.319> make<00:03:27.709> another<00:03:27.830> one<00:03:28.010> of<00:03:28.190> these

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
be safe let's make another one of these

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.220 
be safe let's make another one of these
I'm<00:03:29.510> gonna<00:03:29.660> slap<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:29.930> on<00:03:30.170> here<00:03:32.019> it<00:03:33.019> would<00:03:33.140> be

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
I'm gonna slap it on here it would be

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:36.009 
I'm gonna slap it on here it would be
really<00:03:33.860> useful<00:03:33.890> in<00:03:34.579> making<00:03:34.940> that<00:03:35.030> sprocket<00:03:35.569> if

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
really useful in making that sprocket if

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.619 
really useful in making that sprocket if
I<00:03:36.170> had<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.319> drill<00:03:36.620> press<00:03:36.829> and<00:03:37.190> a<00:03:37.879> guy<00:03:38.030> font<00:03:38.360> from

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
I had a drill press and a guy font from

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.589 
I had a drill press and a guy font from
online<00:03:38.860> told<00:03:39.860> me<00:03:39.980> he's<00:03:40.129> sending<00:03:40.489> me<00:03:40.519> a<00:03:40.879> new

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
online told me he's sending me a new

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:43.960 
online told me he's sending me a new
capacitor<00:03:42.200> for<00:03:42.379> my<00:03:42.500> drill<00:03:43.099> press<00:03:43.129> which<00:03:43.940> is

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
capacitor for my drill press which is

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.150 
capacitor for my drill press which is
really<00:03:44.239> awesome<00:03:44.359> this<00:03:44.959> should<00:03:45.109> be<00:03:45.170> Kara<00:03:45.379> two

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
really awesome this should be Kara two

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.809 
really awesome this should be Kara two
days<00:03:46.310> I<00:03:46.459> think<00:03:46.519> anyway<00:03:47.480> so<00:03:48.670> today<00:03:49.670> I<00:03:49.760> figured

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819
