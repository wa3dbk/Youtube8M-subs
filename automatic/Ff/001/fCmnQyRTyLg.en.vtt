00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.760
 We all have a calendar age 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.369
 these are the days we spend with ours 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.619
 have already demolished calendars and 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.439
 who knows how many leaves left 

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:28.230
 this calendar is now we can 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:31.510
 through a sensible way of life 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.350
 try this in ours 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.930
 prosperity society 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:41.970
 aging process of us life expectancy 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.589
 offset by increases we the 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.400
 slow down the aging process and 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:51.000
 this part just as heightened 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.930
 life expectancy on our calendar 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.400
 can put on that means we can 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.119
 again a few calendar slides 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:00.250
 print and attach and a whole 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:01.900
 crucial point and as a hostel 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.629
 certainly already intensively today 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.940
 entered is our blood vessel system 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:12.970
 and you can imagine yourself like that 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:16.480
 tree over its first every single one 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:18.670
 leaf supplied with nutrients and also 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.460
 from the individual scroll the 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.500
 nutrients transported back 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.810
 ours works similarly 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.670
 blood vessel system and also on the tree 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.470
 Can you see what happens when 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:35.440
 such supply network is cut off 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:38.050
 then part of this tree goes 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.690
 in medicine we call that the reason 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.300
 then infarction no matter if that's the brain 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.050
 the heart is the lungs is the intestine 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:49.540
 it comes to a supply disorder 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.909
 this blood vessel system serves on the one hand 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.310
 once the gas exchange so the 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.140
 Supply with our life gases with 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.600
 Oxygen and the secondment of the 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.270
 carbon dioxide and we have ours 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.600
 organism, above all the brain, however 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.970
 including the rest of the organism 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.129
 supply nutrients 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.599
 Of course, the accruing 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.010
 garbage the garbage again 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.569
 be transported away 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.330
 yes and where do we get the nutrients from 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.950
 from the intestine and the gut must be good 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.600
 be there are the 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.490
 nutrients added to the liver 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.610
 transported and over the liver on 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:25.040
 processed stored 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.230
 and transported to the blood vessel system 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.440
 to have a very decisive part 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.820
 here our arteries and if you like that 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.690
 looking at an artery then that is from 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:39.980
 Surrounded by a thick muscle layer and 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:42.020
 this is especially important it regulates the 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:45.590
 depend on the dependency of the body 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.330
 prescribes the supply of nutrients 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.270
 into the organism that's what she means 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.840
 regulates the blood flow depending eg 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.100
 the ambient temperatures of 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.350
 physical exertions too 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.890
 different needs lead but 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:03.160
 even with anxiety and stress completely 

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:05.450
 These vessels regulate decisively 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.430
 our oxygen and 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.830
 nutrient supply and one 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.230
 an indispensable necessity is the 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.590
 elasticity the elasticity of this 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.230
 Vessels and the main control 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.360
 for this function is the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.880
 interior lining of these vessels that 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.150
 endothelium and this intact endothelium 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.480
 has a very smooth surface so 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.400
 the bloodstream unhindered by this 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.049
 can pass through the vessel here 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.540
 you take a micrograph of a 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:38.330
 The vessel in the area where you can 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.140
 the blood flows through and here the 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.060
 lining the endothelium and now 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.269
 let's take this substance exchange 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.549
 area out here we have the 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:51.590
 connection between arteries and veins 

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:53.630
 here is if you want as a kind 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.280
 filter the capital network in between 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.420
 switched and here happens the 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.220
 oxygen exchange here run the 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.670
 blood components the individual cells 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.620
 of the blood in single file 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.260
 after the other through these vessels 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.750
 oxygen passes through the nutrients 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.820
 and other blood components become here 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.680
 delivered to every single body cell 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.320
 and it will also be the pollutants 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.720
 the exhaust if you want that 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.100
 taken up and over the carbon dioxide 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:28.100
 venous system transported away ever 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.740
 healthier these vessels are all the more 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.440
 This substance exchange can be more effective 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:35.800
 happen and with it all have ours 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:38.530
 Organs a high function 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.470
 ability that means the healthier the 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.580
 The slower our vessels go 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:47.440
 aging managed process 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.849
 This smooth surface of the tubes is 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.879
 Impressive if you look under the 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.580
 looking at electron microscope 

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:57.340
 an unfavorable lifestyle we 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:59.919
 have got to know one another 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:02.289
 progressing changes in the 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:04.539
 Vessels and you can see that on the 

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:07.030
 surface and that is then a process 

00:05:04.539 --> 00:05:10.629
 they call calcifications as arteries 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.819
 know atherosclerosis and what enormous 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:15.129
 meaning that we can too 

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:19.300
 From the statistics read a healthy 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:23.229
 Vascular leads to less acute heaps 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:25.360
 less common to acute vessels like one 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:29.340
 such a sick vessel and the 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.940
 difference makes up almost 40 percent 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.139
 healthy vessels are capable of 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:38.139
 to slow down the aging process 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:39.759
 to shorten our biological age 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:42.210
 and thus life expectancy too 

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:42.210
 increase 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:50.380
 the lifestyle is crucial 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:50.860
 that our vessels are long and fit through 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.139
 hold 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.800
 We need this process of 

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:59.289
 atherosclerosis reverse by one 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.699
 metabolism type-specific individual 

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:05.580
 healthy eating 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:05.580
 then fall important parameters of 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.529
 Mobility service if we are too 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:16.690
 to avoid pleasure poisons and drugs 

00:06:13.529 --> 00:06:18.610
 relaxation and stress management more 

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.870
 then give room to the high 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:22.259
 return blood pressure 

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:26.289
 yes, and then we learn each other 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:29.729
 then ours will move sensibly 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.729
 healthier vessels
