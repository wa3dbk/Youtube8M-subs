well<00:00:06.629> how<00:00:06.779> do<00:00:06.839> we<00:00:07.020> study<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.470> different<00:00:07.740> parts

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
well how do we study the different parts

well how do we study the different parts
of<00:00:08.189> the<00:00:08.340> brain<00:00:08.460> as<00:00:08.820> they<00:00:09.030> work<00:00:09.620> one<00:00:10.620> way<00:00:10.830> is<00:00:11.070> to

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
of the brain as they work one way is to

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.039 
of the brain as they work one way is to
record<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.880> electricity<00:00:12.509> that<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.809> brain

record the electricity that the brain
makes<00:00:13.440> as<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.400> engaged<00:00:14.790> in<00:00:15.089> different

makes as it is engaged in different
functions<00:00:16.039> we<00:00:17.039> do<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.400> by<00:00:17.609> picking<00:00:18.060> up<00:00:18.210> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
functions we do this by picking up the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.740 
functions we do this by picking up the
electrical<00:00:18.930> signals<00:00:19.410> using<00:00:20.100> sensors<00:00:20.789> sewn<00:00:21.480> to
