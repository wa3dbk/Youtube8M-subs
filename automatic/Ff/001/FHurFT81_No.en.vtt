 and internet beauty with you guys 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.450
 Let's talk today in a little bit of a 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.240
 system that, in some cases, 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:23.869
 moments of some that is the ben system 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.230
 feder 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.230
 come on 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.420
 This is it folks coming back so let's go 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.670
 speak a little of this system here 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.730
 which is the brt beast system which is really cool 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.090
 Are there any systems that have some 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.330
 wind-up from Okuma, which is the 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:55.129
 butterfly here with this system here ok 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:59.379
 It's basically the following people to 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:07.430
 make our lives much easier, we are the people 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:09.649
 normal normal here is normal just us 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.380
 turn here, you may feel that he too 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:17.270
 I was pressing hard enough 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:20.090
 here I trying to generate totally here 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.240
 I work for you and release the bug here. 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.240
 catch 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.820
 it already releases libera is easy on the hour 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:31.580
 if we pull at the time of 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.910
 put in is to pass the line of the dowels 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.860
 the rod is is a then even discuss one 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:38.240
 very large fish if you do not have time there 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.940
 for me here on the brake 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.500
 We see the thing. 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.520
 complicated because we go there 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:49.009
 it releases pj's there says get run 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 but more will be freer to 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.220
 run load the line and there 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.110
 avoiding getting out of the fish mow line 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.700
 There we still have other adjustments. 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.060
 here we have a normal system of 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.060
 frei 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.830
 Let the coil exactly 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:18.980
 The way we want it is totally 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:23.030

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:26.209

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.310
 It really makes life much easier then only 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.810
