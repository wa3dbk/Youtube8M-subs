00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:28.100 
but he's not the quickest I'm telling
how<00:01:26.220> he<00:01:26.400> didn't<00:01:26.729> feel<00:01:26.880> quick<00:01:27.240> in<00:01:27.479> these<00:01:27.840> clips

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
how he didn't feel quick in these clips

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.780 
how he didn't feel quick in these clips
he<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.500> look<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.680> lot<00:01:28.799> quicker<00:01:29.070> then<00:01:29.640> he

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
he just look a lot quicker then he

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.850 
he just look a lot quicker then he
actually<00:01:29.939> fell<00:01:30.360> when<00:01:30.600> i<00:01:30.630> was<00:01:30.780> using<00:01:30.990> him<00:01:31.259> but

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
actually fell when i was using him but

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.999 
actually fell when i was using him but
him<00:01:32.100> yeah<00:01:32.369> he's<00:01:32.610> not<00:01:33.180> very<00:01:33.540> PC<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.500> go<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:34.829> you

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
him yeah he's not very PC to go so you

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.219 
him yeah he's not very PC to go so you
can<00:01:35.040> tell<00:01:35.310> that<00:01:35.340> from<00:01:35.579> his<00:01:35.759> card<00:01:36.000> but<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:37.020> is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
can tell that from his card but it is

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.810 
can tell that from his card but it is
dribbling<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.890> think<00:01:38.100> that's<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.579> is

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
dribbling I think that's what it is is

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.490 
dribbling I think that's what it is is
he's<00:01:38.970> drooling<00:01:39.180> he's<00:01:39.570> very<00:01:39.840> good<00:01:40.110> on<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> ball

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
he's drooling he's very good on the ball

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.170 
he's drooling he's very good on the ball
keeps<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.310> ball<00:01:41.460> name<00:01:41.640> when<00:01:41.880> he's<00:01:41.970> dribbling

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
keeps the ball name when he's dribbling

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.060 
keeps the ball name when he's dribbling
and<00:01:42.840> he'll<00:01:43.110> tap<00:01:43.320> it<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.560> bit<00:01:43.710> of<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.860> distance

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
and he'll tap it a bit of a distance

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.370 
and he'll tap it a bit of a distance
when<00:01:44.759> he's<00:01:44.880> sprinting<00:01:45.210> but<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.899> am<00:01:46.020> yeah<00:01:46.320> i

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
when he's sprinting but I am yeah i

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.080 
when he's sprinting but I am yeah i
think<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:46.710> is<00:01:46.740> down<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.009> his<00:01:47.189> dribbling<00:01:47.579> why<00:01:47.759> he

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
think it is down to his dribbling why he

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.969 
think it is down to his dribbling why he
looks<00:01:48.630> quite<00:01:48.840> quick<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.350> wings<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:49.860> he

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
looks quite quick on the wings but he

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.819 
looks quite quick on the wings but he
does<00:01:50.399> feel<00:01:50.670> very<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.540> bit<00:01:51.780> sluggish<00:01:52.049> but<00:01:52.409> as<00:01:52.710> i

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
does feel very a bit sluggish but as i

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.230 
does feel very a bit sluggish but as i
said<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.130> ball<00:01:53.280> control<00:01:53.640> does<00:01:53.790> help<00:01:54.000> him<00:01:54.149> out

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
said the ball control does help him out

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.600 
said the ball control does help him out
a<00:01:54.299> hell<00:01:54.540> of<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.720> lot<00:01:55.040> but<00:01:56.040> I'm<00:01:56.159> on<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.490> his

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
a hell of a lot but I'm on to his
