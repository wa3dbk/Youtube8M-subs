Air<00:00:47.670> Tran<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:48.379> they're<00:00:49.379> gonna<00:00:49.530> be<00:00:49.680> replacing

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
Air Tran and they're gonna be replacing

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.180 
Air Tran and they're gonna be replacing
the<00:00:50.219> Delta<00:00:50.520> dc-9s<00:00:51.149> dc9<00:00:52.050> 50s<00:00:52.500> which<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.920> very

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
the Delta dc-9s dc9 50s which is very

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.549 
the Delta dc-9s dc9 50s which is very
sad<00:00:53.399> to<00:00:53.460> see<00:00:53.640> those<00:00:53.789> go<00:00:54.059> I<00:00:55.050> think<00:00:55.289> they're

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
sad to see those go I think they're

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.229 
sad to see those go I think they're
retiring<00:00:55.890> in<00:00:56.160> like<00:00:56.280> two<00:00:56.579> days<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.120> last

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
retiring in like two days the last

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.349 
retiring in like two days the last
flights<00:00:57.570> scheduled<00:00:58.199> for<00:00:58.350> January<00:00:58.829> 6<00:00:59.359> 2014

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
flights scheduled for January 6 2014

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.229 
flights scheduled for January 6 2014
from<00:01:01.079> Minneapolis<00:01:01.530> to<00:01:01.559> Atlanta

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
from Minneapolis to Atlanta

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.179 
from Minneapolis to Atlanta
so<00:01:03.629> if<00:01:03.750> sad<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.049> see<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.290> DC<00:01:04.439> nines<00:01:04.769> go<00:01:04.979> but<00:01:05.159> I

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
so if sad to see the DC nines go but I

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.649 
so if sad to see the DC nines go but I
think<00:01:05.400> the<00:01:05.460> 7<00:01:05.700> was<00:01:05.850> 7<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.180> really<00:01:06.360> solid

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
think the 7 was 7 to really solid

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.530 
think the 7 was 7 to really solid
replacement<00:01:07.200> for<00:01:07.409> it<00:01:07.549> I<00:01:08.549> did<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> little

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
replacement for it I did a little

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.149 
replacement for it I did a little
research<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.020> found<00:01:10.049> out<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.560> 7<00:01:10.890> 1<00:01:10.950> 7

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
research and I found out that 7 1 7

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.830 
research and I found out that 7 1 7
basically<00:01:11.729> how<00:01:11.939> it<00:01:12.000> holds<00:01:12.299> almost<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.689> same

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
basically how it holds almost the same

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.539 
basically how it holds almost the same
number<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.170> seats<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.830> little<00:01:14.280> bit<00:01:14.369> less

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
number of seats a little bit less

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.359 
number of seats a little bit less
actually<00:01:14.970> I<00:01:15.030> think<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.299> dc9<00:01:15.780> hold<00:01:16.189> 120<00:01:17.189> in

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
actually I think the dc9 hold 120 in

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.219 
actually I think the dc9 hold 120 in
these<00:01:17.490> hold<00:01:17.900> 110<00:01:19.130> or<00:01:20.130> somewhere<00:01:20.460> around<00:01:20.549> there

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
these hold 110 or somewhere around there

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.960 
these hold 110 or somewhere around there
with<00:01:22.229> Air<00:01:22.439> Tran<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.920> 7<00:01:23.159> which<00:01:23.280> says<00:01:23.430> actually

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
with Air Tran the 7 which says actually

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.539 
with Air Tran the 7 which says actually
117<00:01:24.840> seats<00:01:25.080> adult<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:25.979> reducing<00:01:26.400> that<00:01:26.490> a

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
117 seats adult is reducing that a

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.370 
117 seats adult is reducing that a
little<00:01:26.850> bit<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.210> think<00:01:27.450> there's<00:01:27.570> gonna<00:01:27.659> be<00:01:27.810> 110

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
little bit I think there's gonna be 110

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.899 
little bit I think there's gonna be 110
because<00:01:29.369> Delta<00:01:30.150> has<00:01:33.680> Delta<00:01:34.680> has<00:01:34.829> first<00:01:35.640> class

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
because Delta has Delta has first class

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.690 
because Delta has Delta has first class
Economy<00:01:36.720> Comfort<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.350> then<00:01:37.979> coach<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.670> a

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
Economy Comfort and then coach so it's a

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.039 
Economy Comfort and then coach so it's a
little<00:01:38.820> bit<00:01:39.000> different<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.540> believe<00:01:39.570> in<00:01:39.930> Air

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
little bit different I believe in Air

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.210 
little bit different I believe in Air
Tran<00:01:41.360> um<00:01:42.360> so<00:01:42.840> zoom<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.500> here<00:01:43.799> hopefully<00:01:44.009> my

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
Tran um so zoom in here hopefully my

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.219 
Tran um so zoom in here hopefully my
camera<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.700> having<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.119> hard<00:01:45.270> time<00:01:45.299> focus<00:01:45.930> but

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
camera is having a hard time focus but

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:55.520 
camera is having a hard time focus but
very<00:01:47.009> nice<00:01:47.250> mild<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.549> lot<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.820> details<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:54.530> it

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
very nice mild a lot of details and it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.260 
very nice mild a lot of details and it
was<00:01:55.649> interesting<00:01:56.250> when<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.399> was<00:01:56.490> watching<00:01:57.149> the

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
was interesting when I was watching the

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.609 
was interesting when I was watching the
whole<00:01:57.329> thing<00:01:57.420> unfold<00:01:57.750> with<00:01:58.200> dealt<00:01:58.380> in<00:01:58.530> the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.070 
buy the 7 was heavens from air
but<00:02:13.380> then<00:02:13.530> they<00:02:14.370> decided<00:02:14.760> not<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.630> so<00:02:15.750> instead

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
but then they decided not to so instead

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.590 
but then they decided not to so instead
Delta<00:02:16.590> picked<00:02:16.800> him<00:02:16.950> up<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.360> they're<00:02:18.360> gonna<00:02:18.450> be

phasing out I said before the dc-9s and
right<00:02:21.420> now<00:02:21.540> I<00:02:21.570> think<00:02:21.660> they<00:02:21.870> have<00:02:22.020> 10<00:02:22.470> of<00:02:22.590> them

the first flight was to Newark and I

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.550 
the first flight was to Newark and I
know<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:30.240> looked<00:02:30.930> it<00:02:31.050> up<00:02:31.110> they're<00:02:31.290> flying<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560

Little<00:02:31.860> Rock<00:02:31.980> in<00:02:32.160> Cleveland<00:02:32.670> so<00:02:33.000> sore<00:02:33.240> those

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
Little Rock in Cleveland so sore those

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.320 
Little Rock in Cleveland so sore those
mid-range<00:02:33.810> destinations<00:02:34.910> but<00:02:35.910> they<00:02:36.030> have<00:02:36.120> 10

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330

in<00:02:36.450> service<00:02:36.780> right<00:02:36.930> now<00:02:37.080> an<00:02:37.230> Air<00:02:37.320> Tran<00:02:37.530> I<00:02:37.560> think

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
in service right now an Air Tran I think

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.890 
in service right now an Air Tran I think
they<00:02:37.920> have<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.370> lot<00:02:38.790> in<00:02:39.150> total<00:02:39.630> I<00:02:39.660> think<00:02:39.690> it's

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
they have a lot in total I think it's

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.350 
they have a lot in total I think it's
somewhere<00:02:40.110> close<00:02:40.440> to<00:02:40.470> 90<00:02:41.100> so<00:02:41.820> Delta<00:02:42.150> will<00:02:42.270> be

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
somewhere close to 90 so Delta will be

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.630 
somewhere close to 90 so Delta will be
picking<00:02:42.630> up<00:02:42.720> a<00:02:42.840> lot<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.020> those<00:02:43.320> 7<00:02:44.070> 1<00:02:44.190> 7<00:02:44.310> s<00:02:44.490> from

see there and this shot I have right now
the<00:03:11.580> tail<00:03:11.850> looks<00:03:11.970> really<00:03:12.420> cool<00:03:12.630> with<00:03:12.750> that

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
the tail looks really cool with that

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.320 
the tail looks really cool with that
sort<00:03:13.230> of<00:03:13.320> reflective<00:03:13.800> texture<00:03:16.100> it's

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
sort of reflective texture it's

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.970 
sort of reflective texture it's
obviously<00:03:18.330> it's<00:03:18.450> similar<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.810> the<00:03:18.870> dc9<00:03:19.320> except

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
obviously it's similar to the dc9 except

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.780 
obviously it's similar to the dc9 except
pretty<00:03:20.190> much<00:03:20.310> just<00:03:20.459> without<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.760> jt8d<00:03:21.239> s<00:03:21.480> I

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
pretty much just without the jt8d s I

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:30.199 
pretty much just without the jt8d s I
