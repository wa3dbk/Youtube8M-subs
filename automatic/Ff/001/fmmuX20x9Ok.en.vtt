 our children 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:16.029
 parents are disturbing the path of knowledge 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.029
 charge and become truly cold 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.689
 Well, they say it was called indoors 

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:23.349
 schools 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:24.900
 almost a lot 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.410
 This is due to the fact that the column will go to 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.130
 publicity 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.480
 30 h 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.260
 during the investigation in october knowledge and usa 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.260
 doing all the time 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.180
 third grade students news 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.990
 the chief will soon have a few days not 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:46.050
 engaged in outerwear 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.079
 warmly dressed not only children but also 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.819

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:52.070
 4 pages 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.070
 in the final 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.700
 how much today is 10 degrees 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.940
 heat from this week is not the most 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.450
 low rate 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.969
 but as it turned out the school and now there is 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:11.969
 colder room 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.670
 if not 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.790
 he 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.120
 well fit and children become 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.840
 here according to school workers 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.690
 air temperature does not rise above 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.300
 six degrees 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.700
 for comments we decided to apply 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.230
 directly to the head of administration 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.320
 mufti turned 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.050
 they know about the problem but establish the reason for not 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.160
 can 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.350
 what about primary school 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.310
 total buildings 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.549
 publication well, for example, I do not understand 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:44.740
 why 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.940
 the publication reports 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:48.860
 in the State Statistics Committee 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.810
 in Italy 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:52.340
 hot 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.110
 when we prepare comes if u head 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.280
 many administrations 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.010
 one of them is any February frosts 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.470
 the second is too much analysis of water 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.920
 villagers 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.229
 and another bad job local 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.340
 public utilities 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.350
 but we are doing it 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.760
 I did not accept the system first today 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.659
 being evaluated how to say 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:16.049
 m scored her just need to just 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.669
 every year is held that is the same 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:21.400
 I still don't know the frequency of that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.649
 why 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:25.429
 we call part of the country to the participants 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:27.609
 where did the district authorities look when 

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.050
 getting ready for winter 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.060
 why this social object 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.490
 turned out to be not ready for the heating season 

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.150
 and why it turned out only in 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.570
 end of February and most importantly who will 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.050
 be responsible for 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.900
 non-compliance with temperature 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.910
 mode and schoolchildren health is possible 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.840
 answers to these questions will be able to find 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.219
