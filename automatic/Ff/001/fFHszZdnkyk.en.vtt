00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.960 

well<00:00:07.710> it's<00:00:07.859> been<00:00:07.980> some<00:00:08.220> time<00:00:08.250> since<00:00:08.460> i<00:00:08.760> made<00:00:08.910> a

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
well it's been some time since i made a

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.790 
well it's been some time since i made a
video<00:00:09.150> and<00:00:09.630> that's<00:00:10.200> because<00:00:10.380> of<00:00:10.530> several

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
video and that's because of several

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.919 
video and that's because of several
reasons<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.820> first<00:00:12.059> of<00:00:12.210> which<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.389> because<00:00:12.900> i

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
reasons the first of which is because i

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.860 
reasons the first of which is because i
had<00:00:13.380> no<00:00:13.530> good<00:00:13.710> news<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.009> report<00:00:14.870> these

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
had no good news to report these

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.359 
had no good news to report these
hydroponic<00:00:16.470> towers<00:00:16.619> that<00:00:16.859> didn't<00:00:17.070> work<00:00:17.160> out

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
hydroponic towers that didn't work out

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.950 
hydroponic towers that didn't work out
too<00:00:17.580> well<00:00:17.609> for<00:00:17.789> three<00:00:18.150> reasons<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.690> i<00:00:18.750> could

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
too well for three reasons that i could

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.519 
too well for three reasons that i could
see<00:00:20.390> the<00:00:21.390> first<00:00:21.630> thing<00:00:21.840> that<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.109> reservoir

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
see the first thing that the reservoir

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.290 
see the first thing that the reservoir
was<00:00:22.650> too<00:00:22.800> small<00:00:23.070> i<00:00:23.130> was<00:00:23.340> only<00:00:23.430> like<00:00:23.609> 30<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:24.029> 35

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
was too small i was only like 30 or 35

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.470 
was too small i was only like 30 or 35
gallons<00:00:25.609> second<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:26.670> which<00:00:26.699> i<00:00:27.150> didn't<00:00:27.390> have

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
gallons second of which i didn't have

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.540 
gallons second of which i didn't have
enough<00:00:27.660> biological<00:00:27.840> filtration<00:00:28.560> so<00:00:29.400> my

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
enough biological filtration so my

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.009 
enough biological filtration so my
ammonia<00:00:29.939> levels<00:00:30.240> were<00:00:30.420> always<00:00:30.630> pretty<00:00:30.750> high

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
ammonia levels were always pretty high

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.420 
ammonia levels were always pretty high
and<00:00:31.289> not<00:00:31.529> too<00:00:31.650> much<00:00:31.769> nitrate<00:00:32.250> or<00:00:32.399> nitrite

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
and not too much nitrate or nitrite

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.139 
and not too much nitrate or nitrite
level<00:00:33.800> so<00:00:34.800> that's<00:00:34.950> both<00:00:35.130> toxic<00:00:35.579> to<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:35.790> plants

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
level so that's both toxic to the plants

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.880 
level so that's both toxic to the plants
and<00:00:36.329> and<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.410> fish<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:39.690> least<00:00:40.320> of<00:00:40.469> all<00:00:40.590> I<00:00:40.649> had

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
and and the fish and least of all I had

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.170 
and and the fish and least of all I had
bad<00:00:41.070> weather<00:00:41.309> in<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.489> beginning<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:41.969> pretty

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
bad weather in the beginning is pretty

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.869 
bad weather in the beginning is pretty
cold<00:00:42.360> windy<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.379> think<00:00:44.370> that<00:00:44.489> had<00:00:44.579> something<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
cold windy I think that had something to

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.920 
cold windy I think that had something to
do<00:00:45.000> with<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:46.039> plan<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.070> reuse<00:00:47.370> these<00:00:47.520> uh

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
do with it I plan to reuse these uh

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.410 
do with it I plan to reuse these uh
towers<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.649> cucumbers<00:00:50.219> which<00:00:51.180> worked<00:00:51.360> great

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
towers for cucumbers which worked great

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.029 
towers for cucumbers which worked great
when<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.780> had<00:00:51.989> them<00:00:52.110> used<00:00:52.289> in<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.500> hydroponic

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
when I had them used in the hydroponic

00:00:53.039 --> 00:01:02.479 
when I had them used in the hydroponic
nutrient<00:00:53.399> system<00:01:00.680> my<00:01:01.680> focus<00:01:01.920> now<00:01:02.190> is<00:01:02.219> on

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
nutrient system my focus now is on

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.990 
nutrient system my focus now is on
sustainability<00:01:04.220> which<00:01:05.220> is<00:01:05.369> why<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.549> built<00:01:05.790> this

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
sustainability which is why I built this

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.590 
sustainability which is why I built this
system<00:01:06.659> for<00:01:06.990> greens<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:08.360> watched<00:01:09.360> some<00:01:09.570> youtube

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
system for greens I watched some youtube

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.590 
system for greens I watched some youtube
videos<00:01:10.110> on<00:01:10.590> commercial<00:01:11.189> lettuce<00:01:12.090> production

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
videos on commercial lettuce production

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.340 
videos on commercial lettuce production
and<00:01:14.420> after<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.540> I<00:01:15.600> want<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:15.960> able<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.200> get

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
and after that I want to be able to get

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.960 
and after that I want to be able to get
a<00:01:16.380> continuous<00:01:16.860> crop<00:01:17.100> out<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.340> my<00:01:17.430> aquaponic

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
a continuous crop out of my aquaponic

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.999 
a continuous crop out of my aquaponic
systems<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.830> built<00:01:20.040> this<00:01:21.650> here<00:01:22.650> in<00:01:22.799> South

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
systems so so I built this here in South

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.670 
systems so so I built this here in South
Florida<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.490> grow<00:01:23.640> stuff<00:01:23.909> year<00:01:24.119> round<00:01:24.680> we

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
Florida can grow stuff year round we

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.340 
Florida can grow stuff year round we
have<00:01:25.770> mild<00:01:25.979> winter<00:01:26.340> so<00:01:26.840> it'll<00:01:27.840> grow<00:01:27.960> lots<00:01:28.170> of

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
have mild winter so it'll grow lots of

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.520 
have mild winter so it'll grow lots of
things<00:01:30.049> that's<00:01:31.049> how<00:01:31.200> they<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.380> it

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
things that's how they do it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.810 
things that's how they do it
commercially<00:01:31.979> they<00:01:32.070> grow<00:01:32.220> lettuce<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.670> deep

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
commercially they grow lettuce in deep

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.609 
commercially they grow lettuce in deep
water<00:01:33.060> culture<00:01:33.299> systems<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.229> basically

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
water culture systems this is basically

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.580 
water culture systems this is basically
what<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.540> they<00:01:36.540> use<00:01:36.720> rafts<00:01:37.049> though<00:01:37.320> that

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
what that is they use rafts though that

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.469 
what that is they use rafts though that
float<00:01:37.860> on<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.009> water<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> I'm<00:01:39.060> growing<00:01:39.360> them

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
float on the water and I'm growing them

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.929 
float on the water and I'm growing them
in<00:01:39.540> net<00:01:39.750> pots<00:01:40.400> basically<00:01:41.400> these<00:01:41.520> tubes<00:01:41.820> are

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
in net pots basically these tubes are

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.620 
in net pots basically these tubes are
completely<00:01:42.420> full<00:01:42.630> of<00:01:42.710> water<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.390> they<00:01:45.390> flow

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
completely full of water and they flow

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.440 
completely full of water and they flow
in<00:01:45.780> from<00:01:45.810> that<00:01:46.110> end<00:01:46.320> and<00:01:46.530> just<00:01:47.000> flow<00:01:48.000> down<00:01:48.210> here

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
in from that end and just flow down here

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.460 
in from that end and just flow down here
to<00:01:49.579> this<00:01:50.579> end<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.630> each<00:01:51.750> one<00:01:51.899> of<00:01:51.960> those<00:01:52.110> is<00:01:52.170> an

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
to this end in each one of those is an

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.020 
to this end in each one of those is an
overflow<00:01:52.950> tube<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:54.649> that's<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:55.860> goes<00:01:56.700> back<00:01:56.880> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
overflow tube and that's it goes back to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.020 
overflow tube and that's it goes back to
the<00:01:57.530> reservoir

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:01.030 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.520 

so<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.329> idea<00:02:02.450> with<00:02:02.719> this<00:02:02.840> grower<00:02:03.109> here<00:02:03.380> is

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
so the idea with this grower here is

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.399 
so the idea with this grower here is
that<00:02:03.710> these<00:02:03.890> first<00:02:04.189> two<00:02:04.340> tubes<00:02:04.640> have<00:02:05.509> 16<00:02:06.079> slots

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 
that these first two tubes have 16 slots

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.330 
that these first two tubes have 16 slots
each<00:02:06.619> and<00:02:06.969> then<00:02:07.969> the<00:02:08.090> sum<00:02:08.330> of<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.569> next<00:02:08.840> 3<00:02:09.340> 13

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
each and then the sum of the next 3 13

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.250 
each and then the sum of the next 3 13
10<00:02:11.000> and<00:02:11.360> 9<00:02:11.890> have<00:02:12.890> 32<00:02:13.569> so<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.599> plan<00:02:14.870> every<00:02:15.110> two

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
10 and 9 have 32 so I plan every two

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.229 
10 and 9 have 32 so I plan every two
weeks<00:02:15.440> or<00:02:15.560> so<00:02:15.769> to<00:02:15.830> replant<00:02:16.610> one<00:02:16.819> or<00:02:16.970> two<00:02:17.120> of

00:02:17.229 --> 00:02:17.239 
weeks or so to replant one or two of

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:18.759 
weeks or so to replant one or two of
these<00:02:17.330> tubes<00:02:17.660> and<00:02:17.900> then<00:02:18.049> move<00:02:18.290> them<00:02:18.410> up<00:02:18.560> as

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
these tubes and then move them up as

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.880 
these tubes and then move them up as
they<00:02:18.950> go<00:02:19.420> of<00:02:20.420> course<00:02:20.690> the<00:02:20.959> back<00:02:21.379> one<00:02:21.590> having

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
they go of course the back one having

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.670 
they go of course the back one having
nine<00:02:22.069> slots<00:02:22.400> has<00:02:22.610> more<00:02:22.819> space<00:02:23.000> between<00:02:23.209> them

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
nine slots has more space between them

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.280 
nine slots has more space between them
so<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:24.980> could<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:25.629> step<00:02:26.629> them<00:02:26.750> out<00:02:26.870> as<00:02:26.989> they<00:02:27.110> go

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
so I could just step them out as they go

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.660 
so I could just step them out as they go
and<00:02:27.440> hopefully<00:02:27.590> get<00:02:27.890> a<00:02:27.920> pretty<00:02:28.129> continuous

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
and hopefully get a pretty continuous

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.839 
and hopefully get a pretty continuous
crop<00:02:28.910> out<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.319> the<00:02:30.319> reservoir<00:02:30.769> to<00:02:31.489> come<00:02:31.670> with<00:02:31.819> a

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:31.849 
crop out of the reservoir to come with a

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.380 
crop out of the reservoir to come with a
container<00:02:32.329> house<00:02:32.690> in<00:02:32.959> this<00:02:33.110> um<00:02:33.910> house<00:02:34.910> which<00:02:35.239> I

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
container house in this um house which I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.809 
container house in this um house which I
mainly<00:02:35.780> used<00:02:36.410> recycled<00:02:37.010> materials<00:02:37.579> out<00:02:37.700> of

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
mainly used recycled materials out of

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.640 
mainly used recycled materials out of
even<00:02:37.970> this<00:02:38.060> plastic<00:02:38.510> I<00:02:38.599> found<00:02:38.870> the<00:02:38.989> trash<00:02:39.260> it's

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
even this plastic I found the trash it's

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.059 
even this plastic I found the trash it's
acrylic<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:40.340> just<00:02:41.299> painted<00:02:41.540> like<00:02:41.870> a<00:02:41.900> wash<00:02:42.799> on

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
acrylic I just painted like a wash on

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.380 
acrylic I just painted like a wash on
there<00:02:43.220> to<00:02:43.340> keep<00:02:43.459> most<00:02:43.610> of<00:02:43.760> light<00:02:43.940> outside<00:02:44.120> and

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
there to keep most of light outside and

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.680 
there to keep most of light outside and
have<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.510> big<00:02:44.690> algae<00:02:44.989> bloom<00:02:46.599> within<00:02:47.599> the

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 
have a big algae bloom within the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.930 
have a big algae bloom within the
reservoir<00:02:48.170> I<00:02:48.440> guess<00:02:48.829> it's<00:02:48.980> like<00:02:49.099> 300<00:02:49.370> gallon

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940

the new reservoir these towers i'm going

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:02.460 
the new reservoir these towers i'm going
to<00:04:00.530> put<00:04:00.650> further<00:04:00.890> over<00:04:01.220> this<00:04:01.340> way<00:04:01.549> and<00:04:01.730> then

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
to put further over this way and then

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:04.390 
to put further over this way and then
cut<00:04:03.470> it<00:04:03.560> out<00:04:03.650> a<00:04:03.709> little<00:04:03.860> bit<00:04:03.950> diff<00:04:04.160> i'm<00:04:04.280> not

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
cut it out a little bit diff i'm not

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.979 
cut it out a little bit diff i'm not
going<00:04:04.519> to<00:04:04.549> use<00:04:04.670> these<00:04:04.790> net<00:04:04.970> pots<00:04:05.180> anymore<00:04:05.630> the

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
going to use these net pots anymore the

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.809 
going to use these net pots anymore the
holes<00:04:06.200> i'm<00:04:06.980> going<00:04:07.099> to<00:04:07.190> cut<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.430> tops<00:04:07.640> out<00:04:07.790> a

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:07.819 
holes i'm going to cut the tops out a

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:09.490 
holes i'm going to cut the tops out a
little<00:04:08.030> different<00:04:08.390> and<00:04:08.510> put<00:04:08.720> gravel<00:04:09.049> in<00:04:09.290> there

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
little different and put gravel in there

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.630 
little different and put gravel in there
and<00:04:09.709> that<00:04:09.920> should<00:04:10.069> help<00:04:10.160> out<00:04:10.310> a<00:04:10.370> lot<00:04:10.519> with

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 
and that should help out a lot with

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.330 
and that should help out a lot with
biological<00:04:11.239> filtration<00:04:11.599> give<00:04:12.200> a<00:04:12.230> lot<00:04:12.440> of<00:04:12.560> area

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
biological filtration give a lot of area

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.120 
biological filtration give a lot of area
for<00:04:13.519> bacteria<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:13.970> grow<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:15.130> replant

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
for bacteria to grow and replant

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.670 
for bacteria to grow and replant
cucumbers<00:04:16.639> I'll<00:04:17.419> see<00:04:17.600> how<00:04:17.660> that<00:04:17.810> goes<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:18.229> don't
