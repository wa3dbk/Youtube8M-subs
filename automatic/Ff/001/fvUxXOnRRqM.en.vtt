00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.750
 every March 22 celebrates the world day 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:15.000
 of water with what is worth knowing 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.040
 purification processes so that the 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.570
 water is suitable for consumption and use 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.939
 purification consists of eliminating 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.860
 all physical pathogens 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.750
 chemical and biological that water 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.119
 could contain before being 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.429
 distributed to the population explains the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.570
 municipal water company matches the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.339
 water that reaches the plant 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.290
 ccoo treatment and the largest 

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:36.750
 of empagua and that is located in the 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.879
 kilometer 17.5 of the highway 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.070
 Interamericana provides 39 percent 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.649
 from drinking water to the capital the liquid 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.300
 comes from the bizkaia plant already located 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.850
 on the farm 'el tesoro' zaragoza 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.660
 chimaltenango 52 kilometers from the 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.520
 capital 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.460
 in this plant the water flow enters 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.469
 raw by gravity here is 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.270
 can observe the accumulated foam of 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.609
 soap that people use to 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.109
 bathe and wash clothes in the rivers a 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.719
 barrier helps trap solid waste 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.820
 big as garbage and branches on the stage 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.990
 of chlorination gas chlorine is applied 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.899
 to eliminate pollution 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.420
 bacteriological to reduce matter 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.000
 cause of taste and smell to water by 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.070
 oxidation then quality is added 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840
 to correct the acidity of the water and the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.120
 hydrogen aluminum sulfate is added 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.310
 to eliminate turbidity and sulfate 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:25.620
 copper to destroy the gas in the stage 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.870
 of flocculation the aluminum sulfate and 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.880
 copper sulfate act as coagulants 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.530
 of mud and soap particles in the 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.140
 slow mixing channel called 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.150
 flocculators the speed of the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.240
 channel so that the particles coagulated 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.890
 are deposited in the bottom of the tanks 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.960
 during sedimentation the particles 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.690
 they react by gravitational effect and they 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.399
 deposit in the event then it is collected 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.170
 the upper free water flow 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.360
 particles that agglomerated in the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.250
 background all the matter is retained in 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.530
 suspension that failed to settle with 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.290
 a natural filter composed of stones 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.330
 boulder sand silica and anthracite 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.710
 the filtered water is led to a 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.360
 storage tank where 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.539
 effect the final disinfection of 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.820
 pathogenic microorganisms with chlorine 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:10.920
 then it is distributed to the city according to the 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.080
 chemical analysis this water is suitable for 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.330
 drink and use this process of 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.550
 potabilization lasts 8 hours since the 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.319
 water enters the plant until it 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.930
 Distribute to the user 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:24.299
 in the plant what of ccoo and 140 is produced 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.930
 thousand cubic meters of water a day that is 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.930
 thousand 840 liters of water per second
