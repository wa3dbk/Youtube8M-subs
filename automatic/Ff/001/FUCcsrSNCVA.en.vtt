00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
morning I'll say early morning 730 so

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.039 
morning I'll say early morning 730 so
there<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.430> go<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.210> how<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.570> goes<00:02:03.780> and

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
there you go this is how it goes and

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.020 
there you go this is how it goes and
this<00:02:04.649> actually<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:05.040> fluctuating<00:02:05.340> a<00:02:05.610> fair<00:02:05.850> bit

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
this actually is fluctuating a fair bit

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.059 
this actually is fluctuating a fair bit
this<00:02:06.689> is<00:02:06.899> just<00:02:07.290> because<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.649> recording

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
this is just because of the recording

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.229 
this is just because of the recording
program<00:02:08.429> causing<00:02:08.879> because<00:02:09.060> a<00:02:09.090> lot<00:02:09.209> of

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
program causing because a lot of

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.369 
program causing because a lot of
processes<00:02:09.899> running<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.289> background

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
processes running in the background

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.220 
processes running in the background
generally<00:02:11.160> if<00:02:11.459> you're<00:02:11.640> not<00:02:11.760> recording<00:02:12.090> for<00:02:13.050> me

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
generally if you're not recording for me

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.030 
generally if you're not recording for me
this<00:02:13.500> will<00:02:13.680> use

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
this will use

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.440 
this will use
running<00:02:14.250> around<00:02:14.659> 28<00:02:15.659> times<00:02:16.290> quicker<00:02:17.329> but<00:02:18.329> I'm

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
running around 28 times quicker but I'm

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.520 
running around 28 times quicker but I'm
just<00:02:18.540> gonna<00:02:18.689> leave<00:02:18.780> this<00:02:18.930> running<00:02:19.079> just<00:02:19.379> for<00:02:19.469> a

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
just gonna leave this running just for a

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.990 
just gonna leave this running just for a
little<00:02:19.650> bit<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:19.950> show<00:02:20.189> you<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.819> thing<00:02:20.849> is

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
little bit to show you but the thing is

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.759 
little bit to show you but the thing is
I<00:02:21.269> said<00:02:21.450> it's<00:02:21.629> only<00:02:21.840> because<00:02:21.989> I'm<00:02:22.349> recording

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
I said it's only because I'm recording

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:24.649 
I said it's only because I'm recording
it's<00:02:23.129> the<00:02:23.250> reason<00:02:23.489> why<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:23.700> simulation<00:02:24.390> is

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
it's the reason why this simulation is

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.080 
it's the reason why this simulation is
going<00:02:24.900> was<00:02:25.379> fluctuating<00:02:25.890> way<00:02:26.340> too<00:02:26.400> much<00:02:26.730> but

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
going was fluctuating way too much but

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.059 
going was fluctuating way too much but
fragma<00:02:28.049> sake<00:02:28.230> I'm<00:02:28.349> going<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.590> actually<00:02:28.709> stop

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
fragma sake I'm going to actually stop

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:31.270 
fragma sake I'm going to actually stop
up<00:02:29.250> at<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.459> time<00:02:29.700> now<00:02:29.969> has<00:02:30.209> already<00:02:30.329> passed

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
up at the time now has already passed

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.520 
up at the time now has already passed
and<00:02:32.280> as<00:02:33.000> you<00:02:33.420> can<00:02:33.510> also<00:02:33.629> see<00:02:33.810> there<00:02:34.409> is<00:02:34.500> a

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
and as you can also see there is a

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.979 
and as you can also see there is a
spider<00:02:34.920> outside<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.430> damn<00:02:35.640> window<00:02:35.989> hello

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
gentlemen is a basic overview of the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.250 
gentlemen is a basic overview of the
somnium<00:02:52.349> odd<00:02:52.530> he's<00:02:53.010> pretty<00:02:53.370> damn<00:02:53.549> awesome

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:54.260 
somnium odd he's pretty damn awesome

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:57.409 
somnium odd he's pretty damn awesome
definitely<00:02:55.260> go<00:02:55.349> try<00:02:55.739> it<00:02:55.769> out<00:02:55.950> I<00:02:56.250> said<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.269> only

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
definitely go try it out I said the only

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:00.589 
definitely go try it out I said the only
reason<00:02:57.629> why<00:02:57.810> has<00:02:58.019> there<00:02:58.379> are<00:02:58.909> some<00:02:59.909> very<00:03:00.329> minor

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
reason why has there are some very minor

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.119 
reason why has there are some very minor
issues<00:03:01.019> but<00:03:01.230> that's<00:03:01.349> only<00:03:01.500> really<00:03:01.829> for<00:03:02.010> when

00:03:02.119 --> 00:03:02.129 
issues but that's only really for when

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:04.280 
issues but that's only really for when
it<00:03:02.250> comes<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.549> actually<00:03:02.790> recording<00:03:03.419> your

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
it comes to actually recording your

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.110 
it comes to actually recording your
actual<00:03:04.620> game<00:03:04.829> that's<00:03:05.280> when<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:05.819> issues

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
actual game that's when the issues

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.780 
actual game that's when the issues
really<00:03:06.299> starts<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:07.019> otherwise<00:03:07.919> it<00:03:08.220> does<00:03:08.459> go<00:03:08.760> a

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
really starts so otherwise it does go a

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.270 
really starts so otherwise it does go a
lot<00:03:09.120> quicker<00:03:09.150> it's<00:03:09.720> generally<00:03:10.260> not<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:10.859> slow

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
lot quicker it's generally not this slow

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.429 
lot quicker it's generally not this slow
as<00:03:11.879> I<00:03:12.060> said<00:03:12.269> familiy<00:03:12.689> generally<00:03:13.109> it's<00:03:13.200> using

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:13.439 
as I said familiy generally it's using

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:17.149 
as I said familiy generally it's using
around<00:03:13.650> 28<00:03:14.099> times<00:03:14.669> quicker<00:03:15.379> but<00:03:16.379> the<00:03:16.889> only

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:17.159 
around 28 times quicker but the only

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:18.500 
around 28 times quicker but the only
general<00:03:17.579> that<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.970> zombie<00:03:18.329> mod

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 
general that is the zombie mod
