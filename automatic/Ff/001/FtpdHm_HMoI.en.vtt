7/8 inches and then I'm going to cut it
up<00:00:30.060> to<00:00:31.130> make<00:00:32.130> for<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.989> for<00:00:33.989> the<00:00:34.110> bottom<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
up to make for the for the bottom the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.840 
up to make for the for the bottom the
next<00:00:35.460> step<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.710> I'm<00:00:37.710> going<00:00:37.770> to<00:00:38.040> cut<00:00:38.250> this<00:00:38.460> to

next step is I'm going to cut this to

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.240 
next step is I'm going to cut this to
slightly<00:00:39.510> more<00:00:39.750> than<00:00:39.989> 6<00:00:40.350> inches<00:00:40.620> because<00:00:41.040> I'm

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
slightly more than 6 inches because I'm

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:50.460 
slightly more than 6 inches because I'm
going<00:00:41.489> to<00:00:41.579> Lisa

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.470 

I'll<00:00:51.470> get<00:00:51.650> ready<00:00:51.860> to<00:00:52.100> cut<00:00:52.520> a<00:00:52.550> mitre<00:00:52.880> on<00:00:53.210> the

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:53.480 
I'll get ready to cut a mitre on the

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.550 
I'll get ready to cut a mitre on the
ends

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:54.560 
ends

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.160 
ends
I<00:00:54.590> made<00:00:55.520> this<00:00:55.700> kind<00:00:55.970> of<00:00:56.060> a<00:00:56.210> temporary<00:00:56.750> fence

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
I made this kind of a temporary fence

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.000 
I made this kind of a temporary fence
because<00:00:57.680> I<00:00:57.710> wanted<00:00:58.270> a<00:00:59.270> longer<00:01:00.260> edge<00:01:00.440> on<00:01:00.710> this

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
because I wanted a longer edge on this

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.940 
because I wanted a longer edge on this
side<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:02.270> that<00:01:02.450> I<00:01:02.570> could<00:01:02.780> clap<00:01:03.080> a<00:01:03.290> stop<00:01:03.710> block

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
side so that I could clap a stop block

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:12.220 
side so that I could clap a stop block
after<00:01:04.309> I<00:01:04.519> cut<00:01:04.879> the<00:01:05.059> first<00:01:05.619> mitre

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:12.230 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.040 

I'm<00:01:13.220> using<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:13.820> stop<00:01:14.060> block<00:01:14.270> on<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:14.810> miter

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:15.050 
I'm using the stop block on the miter

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.860 
I'm using the stop block on the miter
fence<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:15.770> that<00:01:15.950> I<00:01:16.130> can<00:01:16.340> get<00:01:16.520> the<00:01:16.760> length<00:01:17.660> of

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:17.870 
fence so that I can get the length of

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:25.030 
fence so that I can get the length of
the<00:01:17.960> miters<00:01:18.380> cut<00:01:18.680> exactly<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.580> same<00:01:24.040> table

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
the miters cut exactly the same table

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.510 
the miters cut exactly the same table
and<00:01:25.490> the<00:01:25.580> bearing<00:01:25.970> on<00:01:26.150> top<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.720> give<00:01:26.930> me<00:01:27.520> one

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
and the bearing on top to give me one

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.000 
and the bearing on top to give me one
quarter<00:01:29.000> inch<00:01:29.240> up<00:01:29.570> this<00:01:30.020> way<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:30.680> then<00:01:30.830> I'm

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
quarter inch up this way and then I'm

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.880 
quarter inch up this way and then I'm
going<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:31.360> go<00:01:32.360> up<00:01:32.480> just<00:01:32.510> enough<00:01:33.080> to<00:01:33.320> have<00:01:33.860> a

going to go up just enough to have a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.550 
going to go up just enough to have a
little<00:01:34.400> seat<00:01:34.940> down<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:35.330> bottom<00:01:35.780> it's<00:01:36.140> easy<00:01:36.320> to

here to carve out a lot of the wood
before<00:01:57.230> I<00:01:57.260> use<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.560> router<00:01:57.980> that<00:01:58.460> way<00:01:59.000> I<00:01:59.030> don't

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
before I use a router that way I don't

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.900 
before I use a router that way I don't
have<00:01:59.480> to<00:01:59.750> waste<00:01:59.990> a<00:02:00.500> router<00:02:00.830> bit<00:02:01.160> so<00:02:01.460> I<00:02:01.490> have<00:02:01.520> the

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
have to waste a router bit so I have the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.250 
have to waste a router bit so I have the
bottom<00:02:02.830> about<00:02:03.830> ready<00:02:04.190> and<00:02:04.810> these<00:02:05.810> will<00:02:06.050> leave

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
bottom about ready and these will leave

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.400 
bottom about ready and these will leave
the<00:02:06.470> sides<00:02:06.800> will<00:02:07.490> have<00:02:08.000> handles<00:02:08.780> on<00:02:09.020> them<00:02:09.260> I've

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
the sides will have handles on them I've

got the miters cut the miters cut here a
little<00:02:13.430> rabbit<00:02:13.790> cut<00:02:14.390> in<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:15.200> bottom<00:02:15.650> so<00:02:15.920> that

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
little rabbit cut in the bottom so that

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.210 
little rabbit cut in the bottom so that
they'll<00:02:16.280> fit<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.900> bottom<00:02:18.110> will<00:02:18.440> fit<00:02:18.740> in<00:02:18.950> there

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
they'll fit the bottom will fit in there

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.010 
they'll fit the bottom will fit in there
I<00:02:19.459> made<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.170> template<00:02:21.170> to<00:02:21.680> take<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.459> router

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
I made a template to take a router

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.479 
I made a template to take a router
around<00:02:24.190> the<00:02:25.930> template<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.140> carve<00:02:28.040> out<00:02:28.250> the

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
around the template and carve out the

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:32.410 
around the template and carve out the
rest<00:02:29.020> I'm<00:02:30.020> using<00:02:30.380> a<00:02:30.770> pattern<00:02:31.250> router<00:02:31.700> bit<00:02:32.120> and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
rest I'm using a pattern router bit and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.780 
rest I'm using a pattern router bit and
the<00:02:32.570> bearing<00:02:33.020> will<00:02:33.290> ride<00:02:33.320> the<00:02:33.890> template<00:02:34.430> so

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
the bearing will ride the template so

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.060 
the bearing will ride the template so
that<00:02:34.820> we<00:02:35.630> get<00:02:35.870> a<00:02:35.900> nice<00:02:36.230> smooth<00:02:36.770> cut<00:02:39.070> rabbets

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
that we get a nice smooth cut rabbets

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.560 
that we get a nice smooth cut rabbets
cut<00:02:40.670> in<00:02:41.570> all<00:02:41.810> the<00:02:42.050> end<00:02:42.230> pieces<00:02:42.560> and<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.570> side

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
cut in all the end pieces and the side

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.280 
cut in all the end pieces and the side
pieces<00:02:45.200> I've<00:02:45.470> got<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:46.010> arm<00:02:46.489> holes<00:02:46.820> cut<00:02:47.290> here

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
pieces I've got the arm holes cut here

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.380
