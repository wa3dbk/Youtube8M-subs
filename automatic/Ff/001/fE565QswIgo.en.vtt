00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.950
 Well the first thing we do is go to 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.110
 link that you can also leave the 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.310

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:44.879
 here we give to open with tower 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.879
 if we are going to accept 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.220
 and here the other one you want to add in 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.770
 is on the list of good torrents is 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:55.040
 because I already downloaded it and install it here 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.670
 we give you that if you accept and you are 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:01.510
 will start to download the game 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.289
 good once fuck 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.289
 once 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.270
 have downloaded the torrent 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.120
 we do not open 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.760
 and we will have a bar and spills 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.040
 then we have to extract the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.530
 rar files 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.750
 in a folder I brought them here in the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.650
 desk because it's more comfortable for me 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.650
 for you to see 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.719
 we open this 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.720
 and we started extracting it here 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.200
 and you extract it I'm going to 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.400
 cancel because I already have it if and I 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.430
 it's going to take a lot longer 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.890
 canceled it and once you are already 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.909
 I have extracted the game 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.909
 they will stay 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.060
 they will have the crack and an image 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.670
 did 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.030
 Now is when we need the demons 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.030
 tools 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.670
 and the good book what we have to 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.670
 to do is to open the monster 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.760
 and here 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.810
 here what we have to do is wait 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:31.510
 I here in the shade 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.510
 you are going to add an image 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:40.340
 and here we go where we extract the slight 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.340
 the image did with the crack 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.090
 now we select the iso image and we 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.220
 we give to open we will be a unit 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:53.330
 virtual and this virtual unit we are going to 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:58.300
 we are going to add it 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.300
 let's say adding the virtual device 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.580
 this is going to be 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:07.100
 and now we do this 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:12.550
 we run this here and we will stay 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:12.550
 ready now we can install the nba 214 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.720
 well here we close we are going to 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.720
 our team 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:28.500
 and we are going to open it 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:32.710
 heart attack here is the hedge we opened 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.069
 we see that if you install it they choose 

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:38.030
 the directory and everything 

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:40.620
 I do not do it because apart I already have it 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.829
 will not give me the option to install it 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.560
 again I will leave or repair or 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.489
 eliminate then what I will do or 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.489
 I will not cancel it 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:58.930
 I installed it by default because 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.930
 my file has more memory 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:10.120
 this one has 350 miles and this has 24 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:13.180
 Besides, we go and go where it is 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:17.090
 installed the leveler 14 where the 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:19.200
 you installed we are going to properties 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.810
 to open location 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.360
 and here is the here is here here 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.379
 is in draft 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:31.069
 well now we go where we extract the 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:31.069
 winrar 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:40.650
 we open the crack and these two files 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.650
 then we had it where we installed the nba 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.230
 we run it here and you replace it 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.230
 replace the destination files 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:59.270
 well once you have done all that 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.270
 will be ready to play the liberated 14 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.149
 and this would be all 

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:05.829
 I will leave the links in the 

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:08.519

00:05:05.829 --> 00:05:12.219
