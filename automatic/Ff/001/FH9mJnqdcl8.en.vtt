is the IDS or integrated dynamic system

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.080 
is the IDS or integrated dynamic system
we<00:03:43.350> mentioned<00:03:43.770> it<00:03:43.830> before<00:03:43.980> but<00:03:44.460> once<00:03:44.880> we're<00:03:45.060> on

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
we mentioned it before but once we're on

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.730 
we mentioned it before but once we're on
the<00:03:45.210> road<00:03:45.420> you<00:03:45.570> really<00:03:45.840> do<00:03:45.990> feel<00:03:46.230> a<00:03:46.290> difference

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:46.740 
the road you really do feel a difference

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.650 
the road you really do feel a difference
in<00:03:46.830> the<00:03:46.920> way<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.190> the<00:03:47.310> car<00:03:47.520> feels<00:03:47.550> or<00:03:48.330> gives

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
in the way that the car feels or gives

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.480 
in the way that the car feels or gives
that<00:03:48.870> feedback<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.500> you<00:03:49.830> whether<00:03:50.310> it's

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:50.490 
that feedback to you whether it's

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.880 
that feedback to you whether it's
comfort<00:03:51.000> normal<00:03:51.270> or<00:03:51.570> sport<00:03:51.750> now<00:03:52.200> I<00:03:52.470> obviously

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
comfort normal or sport now I obviously

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.680 
comfort normal or sport now I obviously
put<00:03:53.370> on<00:03:53.520> sport<00:03:53.880> because<00:03:54.150> I<00:03:54.240> want<00:03:54.480> a<00:03:54.630> little

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490 
more feeling in the steering wheel and I

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.250 
more feeling in the steering wheel and I
like<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.640> little<00:03:56.790> more<00:03:57.060> throttle<00:03:57.300> control<00:03:57.810> you

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
like a little more throttle control you

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.780 
like a little more throttle control you
add<00:03:58.440> that<00:03:58.710> to<00:03:58.980> putting<00:03:59.220> that<00:03:59.310> automatic

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
add that to putting that automatic

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:01.820 
add that to putting that automatic
transmission<00:04:00.360> into<00:04:00.570> its<00:04:00.720> sport<00:04:01.080> mode<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.500> it

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
transmission into its sport mode and it

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:03.470 
transmission into its sport mode and it
really<00:04:02.010> does<00:04:02.220> give<00:04:02.370> a<00:04:02.400> sporty<00:04:02.940> feel<00:04:02.970> when

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
really does give a sporty feel when

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.300
