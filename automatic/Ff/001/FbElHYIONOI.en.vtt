00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.550 
I'm not even pressing anything in the
walk-in<00:02:33.180> so<00:02:34.180> all<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.840> buttons<00:02:35.110> work<00:02:35.170> fine

until I start hitting the right button

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.770 
until I start hitting the right button
and<00:02:37.810> if<00:02:38.530> that<00:02:38.800> even<00:02:39.040> responds<00:02:39.640> after<00:02:40.480> it

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
and if that even responds after it

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.360 
and if that even responds after it
responds<00:02:41.170> that<00:02:41.260> goes<00:02:41.440> wonky<00:02:41.950> and<00:02:42.070> starts

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
responds that goes wonky and starts

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:47.910 
responds that goes wonky and starts
walking<00:02:42.820> his<00:02:43.150> own<00:02:43.270> way<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:46.530> let's<00:02:47.530> share<00:02:47.770> how

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
walking his own way so let's share how

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.210 
walking his own way so let's share how
that<00:02:48.130> would<00:02:48.220> be<00:02:48.340> repairable<00:02:48.850> but<00:02:49.000> it<00:02:50.040> I'm<00:02:51.040> like

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
that would be repairable but it I'm like

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.130 
that would be repairable but it I'm like
I<00:02:51.250> might<00:02:51.730> know<00:02:51.880> anything<00:02:52.300> it<00:02:52.570> doesn't<00:02:52.810> look

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
I might know anything it doesn't look

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.700 
I might know anything it doesn't look
like<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.860> was<00:02:54.010> due<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.400> wear<00:02:54.580> and<00:02:54.610> tear<00:02:54.970> so<00:02:55.710> I

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:56.710 
like it was due to wear and tear so I

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:58.590 
like it was due to wear and tear so I
wonder<00:02:57.010> if<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.160> open<00:02:57.460> it<00:02:57.490> up<00:02:57.640> if<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:58.030> can<00:02:58.180> I've<00:02:58.420> had

00:02:58.590 --> 00:02:58.600 
wonder if I open it up if I can I've had

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.490 
wonder if I open it up if I can I've had
somehow<00:02:58.870> but<00:02:59.260> I'm<00:02:59.620> unsure<00:02:59.800> about<00:03:00.100> that
