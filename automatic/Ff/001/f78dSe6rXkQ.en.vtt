from the early 90s very processed kind
of<00:02:51.030> sound<00:02:51.240> is<00:02:51.450> what<00:02:51.630> I'm<00:02:51.750> going<00:02:52.140> for<00:02:52.170> on<00:02:52.620> that

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
of sound is what I'm going for on that

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.350 
of sound is what I'm going for on that
particular<00:02:53.310> one<00:02:53.430> because<00:02:53.700> it's<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:54.120> kind<00:02:54.300> of

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
particular one because it's the kind of

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.050 
particular one because it's the kind of
sound<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.750> normally<00:02:54.870> can't<00:02:55.350> get

sound that you normally can't get

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.980 
sound that you normally can't get
outside<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.270> those<00:02:57.450> boxes<00:02:57.930> but<00:02:58.920> yeah<00:02:59.850> I<00:03:00.180> was

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990

yeah and this preset will not be

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:54.740 
yeah and this preset will not be
available<00:03:53.580> because<00:03:53.760> it's<00:03:54.150> just<00:03:54.420> for

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
available because it's just for

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.690

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000 
I'm finding that that blending the EQ on
the<00:04:03.180> Marshall<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.660> the<00:04:03.750> EQ<00:04:04.200> on<00:04:04.230> the<00:04:04.410> G<00:04:04.590> system
