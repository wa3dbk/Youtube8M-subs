started to produce stuff panasonic have

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.200 
started to produce stuff panasonic have
even<00:01:46.649> got<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.770> prototype<00:01:47.340> of<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.579> 4k<00:01:47.970> blu-ray

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
even got a prototype of a 4k blu-ray

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.850 
even got a prototype of a 4k blu-ray
player<00:01:48.780> so<00:01:48.990> that's<00:01:49.140> going<00:01:49.290> to<00:01:49.350> be<00:01:49.409> coming<00:01:49.649> into

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
player so that's going to be coming into

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.069 
player so that's going to be coming into
the<00:01:50.040> mix<00:01:50.189> very<00:01:50.610> soon<00:01:50.790> and<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.390> course<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.720> also

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
the mix very soon and of course I also

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.200 
the mix very soon and of course I also
