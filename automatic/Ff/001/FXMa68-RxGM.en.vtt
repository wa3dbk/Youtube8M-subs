00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
like yes I'm Way smarter than what it

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.350 
like yes I'm Way smarter than what it
was<00:02:33.160> when<00:02:33.370> I<00:02:33.400> came<00:02:33.490> in<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:33.880> I<00:02:33.940> learned<00:02:34.180> some

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
was when I came in and I learned some

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.880 
was when I came in and I learned some
what<00:02:34.480> I've<00:02:34.660> learned<00:02:34.930> so<00:02:35.230> much<00:02:35.380> and<00:02:35.590> I<00:02:35.620> know<00:02:35.650> so

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
what I've learned so much and I know so

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.680 
what I've learned so much and I know so
much<00:02:35.980> more<00:02:36.040> now<00:02:36.250> but<00:02:37.210> that<00:02:37.330> being<00:02:37.480> said<00:02:37.570> I

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
much more now but that being said I

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.750 
much more now but that being said I
think<00:02:37.750> some<00:02:38.020> of<00:02:38.050> my<00:02:38.140> best<00:02:38.560> experiences<00:02:38.830> have

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
think some of my best experiences have

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.750 
think some of my best experiences have
been<00:02:40.120> from<00:02:40.990> my<00:02:41.410> extracurriculars<00:02:42.220> from

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
been from my extracurriculars from

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.610 
been from my extracurriculars from
random<00:02:43.330> things<00:02:43.570> just<00:02:43.780> happening<00:02:44.110> on<00:02:44.230> campus

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
random things just happening on campus

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.290 
random things just happening on campus
from<00:02:45.130> the<00:02:45.400> activities<00:02:45.880> that<00:02:45.910> I've<00:02:46.120> been

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
from the activities that I've been

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.660 
from the activities that I've been
involved<00:02:46.540> in<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.050> I<00:02:47.500> think<00:02:47.740> that<00:02:47.950> College<00:02:48.520> has

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
involved in and I think that College has

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.300 
involved in and I think that College has
yes<00:02:49.150> prepared<00:02:49.570> me<00:02:49.690> for<00:02:49.720> my<00:02:50.230> job<00:02:50.260> but<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.130> also
