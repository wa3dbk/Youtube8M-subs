00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:10.370
 all bedrooms color russia berry large 

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:13.940
 medium density 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:25.820
 large end 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.920
 June received only to think 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:56.910
 taste good gentle but without aroma 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.380
 tender that is just sweet tasty 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:14.130
 she but no raspberry flavor 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:17.000
 but the size of the boat is powerful growth and breeds 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.000
 still a crimson tree 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.030
 water delivery grade that he initially bad 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.970
 multiplies and then it starts 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:33.000
 build up very well 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.610
 overgrown well, shoots don't bother me 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.290
 healer 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:40.910
 all relatives who see accumulates 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.910
 ask you to give and let let bush 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:51.740
 the size of the berry laurel as far as and 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.740
 little boy 1 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.810
 What is the agricultural technology of this class 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:09.320
 somewhere 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.320
 early June you need to pinch the shoots 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.340
 new this year's green is to 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.320
 they started to bush as soon as green 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.130
 escape set off this year he 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.710
 overwinter 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:26.580
 and then with every growth point he has 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.240
 grow brush 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.850
 if it is not, then he has 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.630
 brushes basically turn on top of your head 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:42.410
 and here it was done nip 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.410
 that year at about a meter 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.810
 Look at the trellis if spoilers you 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:53.000
 hard to put it should be done before 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.000
 pinching even below seven meters 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:06.959
 introduction here I spent 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:09.799
 this year somewhere meter sixty 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:13.969
 missed on the top of it when they whispered 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:17.310
 all now these shoots are starting to thrive 

00:03:13.969 --> 00:03:21.870
 each of these I grew this year lay 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:24.480
 fruit buds and sucks it will be great 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.129
 smoothness if u and such 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.310
 large-fruited varieties 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:36.389
 do not pinch them is reduced 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:39.829
 the yield is very strong here shoots 

00:03:36.389 --> 00:03:44.879
 this year it spikes completely 

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:48.480
 Russia's beauty needs height will be such 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:54.060
 then I sprinkle to get all the same 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:57.859
 beat this escape last year here in this 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.859
 year bears fruit 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:24.669
 in the fall all the shoots that made this 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:28.410
 year they can be seen well in drafts 

00:04:24.669 --> 00:04:33.550
 we cut them out from the berries completely and 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:38.830
 reserve also grew this year bin 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:41.380
 horns so we clean now 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:46.650
 so here is the defeat of all sorts of pests and 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:50.860
 diseases we forget that such chemicals 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:54.400
 he escaped that year at an angle of sewing notes 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:05:01.350
 at a height somewhere centimeters yourself already 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.350
 by the ground and it has lateral branching 

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:27.190
 Sur first I am once a marriage shaft is not he is not 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.800
 liked the top could get big 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:33.250
 harvest minsk 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:36.850
 then I understood first you need to leave 

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:39.570
 all shoots all do not delete you 

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:43.390
 how this variety is weakly counted 

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:46.750
 second courses are necessary for sure 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:49.260
 pinch but we are a centimeter and then he 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.290
 gives the Kaliki residual amount 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.810
 side shoots that will help 

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:57.970
 if the tweaks don't he can 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.210
 grow to a meter then on the edge there 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:01.990
 give them these nip addresses to erase 

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:05.770
 5 audio 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:06.430
 then get such a big sweet will 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.930
 single bed 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.930
 it's important not to creep out 

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:25.900
 sugar technique is pinching for 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:28.169
 no old shoots fall skin fall foliage 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:35.849
 carry a dot in front of mine 

00:06:28.169 --> 00:06:35.849
 top well and water at least 1 week 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:47.340
 but before the end of the 6th aching 

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:47.340
 how can such a size pass by 

00:06:53.420 --> 00:07:06.680
 quite transportable view of 

00:06:57.230 --> 00:07:09.680
 enamel on the course sometimes get slightly 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:12.490
 easy easy but it does not affect the overall 

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.490
 plant condition 

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:48.060
 look happened so all the future berries 

00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:51.470
 future berries berries berries 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.470
 all berries 

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.650
 Here is the beauty of Russia
