00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.309 
me you know you know thinking about how
cool<00:02:43.989> it's<00:02:44.200> gonna<00:02:44.350> be<00:02:44.590> when<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.730> famas<00:02:46.319> nerve

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:48.900 
cool it's gonna be when the famas nerve
kinda<00:02:47.739> goes<00:02:47.889> into<00:02:48.100> effect<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.609> I've<00:02:48.700> also

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
kinda goes into effect and I've also

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.670 
kinda goes into effect and I've also
heard<00:02:49.180> that<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.510> odd<00:02:49.660> is<00:02:50.079> going<00:02:50.230> to<00:02:50.560> be

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
heard that the odd is going to be

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.370 
heard that the odd is going to be
affected<00:02:50.980> as<00:02:51.310> well<00:02:51.630> so<00:02:52.630> that's<00:02:52.750> gonna<00:02:52.959> lead<00:02:53.200> to

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
affected as well so that's gonna lead to

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.640 
affected as well so that's gonna lead to
so<00:02:53.680> many<00:02:53.889> more<00:02:54.130> options<00:02:54.430> for<00:02:55.060> guns<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.200> be<00:02:56.349> used

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
so many more options for guns to be used

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.479 
so many more options for guns to be used
and<00:02:56.980> I<00:02:57.480> think<00:02:58.480> it's<00:02:58.709> nothing<00:02:59.709> but<00:02:59.920> positive

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
and I think it's nothing but positive

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.180 
and I think it's nothing but positive
for<00:03:01.000> our<00:03:01.269> community<00:03:01.810> and<00:03:02.049> I<00:03:02.769> think<00:03:02.799> it's<00:03:03.099> going

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
for our community and I think it's going

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.979 
for our community and I think it's going
to<00:03:03.310> lead<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.489> bigger<00:03:03.910> better<00:03:04.030> things<00:03:04.510> as<00:03:04.810> far
