00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:18.659 
about the build a little bit more um the

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:20.569 
about the build a little bit more um the
specific<00:02:19.379> wheels<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:19.950> went<00:02:20.159> with<00:02:20.280> I<00:02:20.400> went

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
specific wheels that I went with I went

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.399 
specific wheels that I went with I went
with<00:02:20.670> a<00:02:20.700> set<00:02:20.970> of<00:02:21.000> HR<00:02:21.450> EES<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:22.110> I<00:02:22.140> don't

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
with a set of HR EES that I don't

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.190 
with a set of HR EES that I don't
exactly<00:02:22.680> remember<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:23.189> precise<00:02:24.060> name<00:02:24.390> of<00:02:24.599> but

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
exactly remember the precise name of but

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.319 
exactly remember the precise name of but
this<00:02:25.620> specific<00:02:25.890> look<00:02:26.519> I<00:02:26.730> actually<00:02:26.879> kind<00:02:27.269> of

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
this specific look I actually kind of

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:29.690 
this specific look I actually kind of
like<00:02:27.510> I<00:02:27.659> like<00:02:27.989> that<00:02:28.230> mesh<00:02:28.500> look<00:02:28.829> on<00:02:29.010> this<00:02:29.459> car

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
like I like that mesh look on this car

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.220 
like I like that mesh look on this car
for<00:02:29.909> some<00:02:30.090> reason<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.750> a<00:02:30.870> little<00:02:31.109> bit

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
for some reason it's a little bit

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.929 
for some reason it's a little bit
different<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.010> can<00:02:32.189> understand<00:02:32.609> how<00:02:32.670> some

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
different and I can understand how some

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:33.890 
different and I can understand how some
people<00:02:33.000> might<00:02:33.239> not<00:02:33.269> like<00:02:33.420> it<00:02:33.599> that's

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
people might not like it that's

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.050 
people might not like it that's
perfectly<00:02:34.290> fine<00:02:34.640> there's<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.730> fine<00:02:36.030> line

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
perfectly fine there's a fine line

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.059 
perfectly fine there's a fine line
between<00:02:36.390> whether<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.290> like<00:02:37.470> that<00:02:37.680> specific

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
between whether you like that specific

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.110 
between whether you like that specific
style<00:02:38.340> or<00:02:38.609> not<00:02:39.090> there<00:02:39.359> certainly<00:02:39.659> is<00:02:39.900> but<00:02:40.290> I

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
style or not there certainly is but I

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.729 
style or not there certainly is but I
think<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.239> biggest<00:02:42.450> thing<00:02:42.659> though<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.170> that

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
think the biggest thing though is that

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.670 
think the biggest thing though is that
front<00:02:44.099> lip<00:02:44.370> that<00:02:44.609> front<00:02:45.030> lip<00:02:45.299> really<00:02:46.200> sets<00:02:46.530> it

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
front lip that front lip really sets it

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.530 
front lip that front lip really sets it
off<00:02:46.769> nicely<00:02:47.190> and<00:02:47.549> I<00:02:47.579> think<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.879> actually<00:02:48.239> makes

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
off nicely and I think it actually makes

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.170 
off nicely and I think it actually makes
the<00:02:48.720> body<00:02:48.989> lines<00:02:49.319> flow<00:02:50.220> just<00:02:50.489> a<00:02:50.609> little<00:02:51.030> bit

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
the body lines flow just a little bit

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.599 
the body lines flow just a little bit
nicer<00:02:51.599> with<00:02:52.139> that<00:02:52.709> that<00:02:52.889> specific<00:02:53.400> wheel

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
nicer with that that specific wheel

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.240 
nicer with that that specific wheel
choice<00:02:53.879> now<00:02:54.450> also<00:02:54.959> something<00:02:55.799> that<00:02:56.040> I<00:02:56.069> haven't

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
choice now also something that I haven't

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.800 
choice now also something that I haven't
really<00:02:56.459> talked<00:02:56.849> about<00:02:56.970> mainly<00:02:57.299> or<00:02:57.510> haven't

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
really talked about mainly or haven't

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.080 
really talked about mainly or haven't
really<00:02:57.989> covered<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.470> much<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:58.920> the<00:02:59.909> fact

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
really covered that much is the fact

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.530 
really covered that much is the fact
that<00:03:00.269> not<00:03:00.959> only<00:03:01.200> will<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.430> two<00:03:02.790> finalists<00:03:03.389> get

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:54.359 
now to focus back again on the build I

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.300 
now to focus back again on the build I
know<00:03:54.419> I'm<00:03:54.599> not<00:03:54.750> I'm<00:03:55.470> not<00:03:55.500> talking<00:03:56.010> about<00:03:56.069> the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
know I'm not I'm not talking about the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.159 
know I'm not I'm not talking about the
build<00:03:56.489> that<00:03:56.639> much<00:03:56.760> at<00:03:56.879> all<00:03:57.000> but<00:03:57.510> I<00:03:57.720> decided<00:03:57.989> to

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
build that much at all but I decided to

00:03:58.169 --> 00:03:59.479 
build that much at all but I decided to
do<00:03:58.229> something<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.560> little<00:03:58.769> bit<00:03:59.040> different<00:03:59.400> with

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
do something a little bit different with

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.189 
do something a little bit different with
my<00:03:59.639> tire<00:03:59.909> pressure<00:04:00.239> and<00:04:00.540> my<00:04:00.629> alignment<00:04:00.930> as

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
my tire pressure and my alignment as

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.110 
my tire pressure and my alignment as
you'll<00:04:01.349> see<00:04:01.530> later<00:04:01.609> my<00:04:02.609> alignment<00:04:03.030> is<00:04:03.090> a

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
you'll see later my alignment is a

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.250 
you'll see later my alignment is a
little<00:04:03.419> bit<00:04:03.540> different<00:04:03.840> I<00:04:03.900> went<00:04:04.079> with<00:04:04.229> a

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
little bit different I went with a

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:05.629 
little bit different I went with a
little<00:04:04.470> bit<00:04:04.680> more<00:04:04.829> negative<00:04:05.010> camber<00:04:05.370> in<00:04:05.549> the

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:05.639 
little bit more negative camber in the

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:07.099 
little bit more negative camber in the
rear<00:04:05.790> than<00:04:05.940> usual<00:04:06.299> just<00:04:06.329> because<00:04:06.659> I<00:04:06.750> wanted<00:04:06.989> to

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
rear than usual just because I wanted to

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:08.899 
rear than usual just because I wanted to
see<00:04:07.470> if<00:04:07.560> I<00:04:07.680> could<00:04:07.829> get<00:04:07.919> it<00:04:08.069> to<00:04:08.159> slide<00:04:08.430> just<00:04:08.729> a

00:04:08.899 --> 00:04:08.909 
see if I could get it to slide just a

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.969 
see if I could get it to slide just a
little<00:04:09.329> bit<00:04:09.449> more<00:04:09.690> I'm<00:04:10.379> trying<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.680> take<00:04:10.829> away

00:04:10.969 --> 00:04:10.979 
little bit more I'm trying to take away

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:13.430 
little bit more I'm trying to take away
a<00:04:11.099> little<00:04:11.310> bit<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.549> rear<00:04:11.699> grip<00:04:11.959> it<00:04:12.959> and<00:04:13.169> just

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
a little bit of rear grip it and just

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.960 
a little bit of rear grip it and just
trying<00:04:13.620> to<00:04:13.739> do<00:04:13.829> it<00:04:13.919> mechanically<00:04:14.400> instead<00:04:14.879> of

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
trying to do it mechanically instead of

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.909 
trying to do it mechanically instead of
trying<00:04:15.180> to<00:04:15.239> do<00:04:15.359> it<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:16.289> horsepower<00:04:16.680> way<00:04:16.859> you

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
trying to do it the horsepower way you

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.560 
trying to do it the horsepower way you
can<00:04:17.130> do<00:04:17.250> it<00:04:17.340> the<00:04:17.400> horsepower<00:04:17.729> way<00:04:17.970> or<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:18.479> can

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
can do it the horsepower way or you can

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.420 
can do it the horsepower way or you can
do<00:04:18.690> it<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.840> mechanical<00:04:19.320> way<00:04:19.440> it<00:04:19.680> just<00:04:19.859> depends

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
do it the mechanical way it just depends

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.879 
do it the mechanical way it just depends
on<00:04:20.779> how<00:04:21.779> you<00:04:21.840> really<00:04:22.079> want<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.380> focus<00:04:22.500> on<00:04:22.770> it

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 
on how you really want to focus on it

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:25.430 
on how you really want to focus on it
but<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:24.270> biggest<00:04:24.539> thing<00:04:24.840> though<00:04:25.020> about<00:04:25.050> this

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
but the biggest thing though about this

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.470 
but the biggest thing though about this
particular<00:04:25.860> car<00:04:26.039> is<00:04:26.250> the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
particular car is the

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.660 
particular car is the
that<00:04:27.660> there's<00:04:28.590> a<00:04:28.680> little<00:04:28.950> bit<00:04:29.070> of<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.220> balance

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
that there's a little bit of a balance

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:32.000 
that there's a little bit of a balance
to<00:04:29.820> it<00:04:29.910> that<00:04:30.060> you<00:04:30.150> can't<00:04:30.480> really<00:04:30.980> you<00:04:31.980> can't

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
to it that you can't really you can't

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.550 
to it that you can't really you can't
really<00:04:32.490> tune<00:04:32.850> it<00:04:33.120> out<00:04:33.300> you<00:04:33.660> can<00:04:33.840> only<00:04:34.020> enhance

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
really tune it out you can only enhance

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.400 
really tune it out you can only enhance
it<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:35.100> I<00:04:35.370> mean<00:04:35.700> unless<00:04:35.820> you<00:04:36.150> go<00:04:36.330> you<00:04:37.290> know

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:37.410 
it and I mean unless you go you know

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.920 
it and I mean unless you go you know
bonkers<00:04:38.130> with<00:04:38.340> your<00:04:38.610> with<00:04:39.390> your<00:04:39.420> actual

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
bonkers with your with your actual

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:42.650 
bonkers with your with your actual
tuning<00:04:40.620> or<00:04:40.770> your<00:04:40.890> alignment<00:04:41.370> or<00:04:41.430> whatever<00:04:41.670> you

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:42.660 
tuning or your alignment or whatever you

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.770 
tuning or your alignment or whatever you
can't<00:04:42.990> really<00:04:43.230> tune<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.430> sweet<00:04:45.120> balance

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
can't really tune the the sweet balance

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.050 
can't really tune the the sweet balance
out<00:04:46.050> of<00:04:46.350> this<00:04:46.680> car<00:04:46.890> you<00:04:47.010> can<00:04:47.040> only<00:04:47.310> enhance<00:04:47.820> it

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
out of this car you can only enhance it

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.280 
out of this car you can only enhance it
if<00:04:48.150> you<00:04:48.240> really<00:04:48.480> know<00:04:48.570> what<00:04:48.690> you're<00:04:48.780> doing<00:04:49.080> and

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
if you really know what you're doing and

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.350 
if you really know what you're doing and
it<00:04:49.860> just<00:04:50.100> gets<00:04:50.280> better<00:04:50.520> and<00:04:50.700> better<00:04:50.850> the<00:04:51.090> more

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
it just gets better and better the more

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.910 
it just gets better and better the more
you<00:04:51.510> play<00:04:51.630> with<00:04:51.840> it<00:04:51.870> I<00:04:52.050> think<00:04:52.110> it's<00:04:52.380> I<00:04:52.680> think

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
you play with it I think it's I think

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.640 
you play with it I think it's I think
that<00:04:53.190> that<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:53.580> one<00:04:54.420> particular<00:04:55.020> fact<00:04:55.350> is

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
that that that one particular fact is

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.220 
that that that one particular fact is
what's<00:04:56.370> been<00:04:56.640> keeping<00:04:56.850> this<00:04:57.150> car<00:04:57.450> really

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:58.230 
what's been keeping this car really

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.520 
what's been keeping this car really
actually<00:04:58.770> high<00:04:58.950> on<00:04:59.070> the<00:04:59.220> list<00:04:59.340> of<00:04:59.580> a<00:04:59.640> lot<00:04:59.760> of<00:04:59.820> a

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
actually high on the list of a lot of a

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.510 
actually high on the list of a lot of a
lot<00:05:01.530> of<00:05:01.590> drifters<00:05:01.890> throughout<00:05:02.160> the<00:05:02.280> Forza

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
lot of drifters throughout the Forza

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.130 
lot of drifters throughout the Forza
series<00:05:02.700> I<00:05:02.910> mean<00:05:03.030> obviously<00:05:03.300> there's<00:05:03.960> other

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:04.140 
series I mean obviously there's other

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.680 
series I mean obviously there's other
drift<00:05:04.470> cars<00:05:04.740> but<00:05:05.430> you'll<00:05:06.090> always<00:05:06.330> see

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:06.690 
drift cars but you'll always see

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:08.960 
drift cars but you'll always see
somebody<00:05:07.160> running<00:05:08.160> a<00:05:08.310> Miata<00:05:08.550> you'll<00:05:08.790> always

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
somebody running a Miata you'll always

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.000 
somebody running a Miata you'll always
see<00:05:09.390> somebody<00:05:09.660> running<00:05:09.960> a<00:05:10.080> Miata<00:05:10.320> there's

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
see somebody running a Miata there's

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:13.490 
see somebody running a Miata there's
always<00:05:11.340> no<00:05:11.730> matter<00:05:11.760> whether<00:05:12.090> its<00:05:12.300> grip<00:05:12.690> drift

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:13.500 
always no matter whether its grip drift

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.930 
always no matter whether its grip drift
I<00:05:14.420> mean<00:05:15.420> even<00:05:15.780> drag<00:05:16.200> sometimes<00:05:16.950> you'll<00:05:17.640> always

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:17.940 
I mean even drag sometimes you'll always

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:19.940 
I mean even drag sometimes you'll always
see<00:05:18.390> somebody<00:05:18.810> running<00:05:19.050> a<00:05:19.170> Miata<00:05:19.440> and<00:05:19.560> I<00:05:19.740> think

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
see somebody running a Miata and I think

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.260 
see somebody running a Miata and I think
I<00:05:20.040> might<00:05:20.250> be<00:05:20.280> reaching<00:05:20.760> a<00:05:20.820> little<00:05:21.030> bit<00:05:21.120> as<00:05:21.240> far

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
I might be reaching a little bit as far

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.900 
I might be reaching a little bit as far
as<00:05:21.540> drag<00:05:21.870> goes<00:05:22.650> but<00:05:23.010> these<00:05:23.160> things<00:05:23.400> are<00:05:23.550> beasts

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:23.910 
as drag goes but these things are beasts

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.200 
as drag goes but these things are beasts
when<00:05:24.030> it<00:05:24.150> comes<00:05:24.330> to<00:05:24.710> grip<00:05:25.710> drift<00:05:26.460> back<00:05:27.030> in

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
when it comes to grip drift back in

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.720 
when it comes to grip drift back in
Forza<00:05:27.540> 4<00:05:27.690> when<00:05:27.900> we<00:05:27.930> when<00:05:28.290> we<00:05:28.440> when<00:05:29.370> we<00:05:29.430> would<00:05:29.640> do

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
Forza 4 when we when we when we would do

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.030 
Forza 4 when we when we when we would do
toga<00:05:30.060> racing<00:05:30.390> up<00:05:30.510> for<00:05:30.660> Jimmy<00:05:30.840> Cato<00:05:31.140> there's<00:05:31.800> I

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
toga racing up for Jimmy Cato there's I

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.100 
toga racing up for Jimmy Cato there's I
think<00:05:32.220> a<00:05:32.490> ton<00:05:32.820> of<00:05:32.850> there's<00:05:33.450> a<00:05:33.510> ton<00:05:33.660> of<00:05:33.690> history

be going sideways at the same time

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.030 
be going sideways at the same time
there's<00:06:00.510> something<00:06:00.690> so<00:06:01.050> awesome<00:06:01.320> about<00:06:01.770> that

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:02.040 
there's something so awesome about that

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.940 
there's something so awesome about that
that<00:06:02.760> you<00:06:03.180> can't<00:06:03.450> really<00:06:03.690> I<00:06:04.020> don't<00:06:04.500> you<00:06:04.680> can't

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:04.950 
that you can't really I don't you can't

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:07.460 
that you can't really I don't you can't
really<00:06:05.160> I<00:06:05.820> don't<00:06:06.750> know<00:06:06.990> I<00:06:07.080> can't<00:06:07.350> really

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:07.470 
really I don't know I can't really

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:09.530 
really I don't know I can't really
define<00:06:08.130> it<00:06:08.160> you<00:06:08.670> can't<00:06:08.880> really<00:06:09.000> define<00:06:09.330> that

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:09.540 
define it you can't really define that

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.520 
define it you can't really define that
how<00:06:09.660> cool<00:06:10.050> that<00:06:10.080> is

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:10.530 
how cool that is

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.970 
how cool that is
and<00:06:10.770> I<00:06:11.960> definitely<00:06:12.960> think<00:06:13.350> if<00:06:13.410> you<00:06:13.530> haven't

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:13.980 
and I definitely think if you haven't

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:16.520 
and I definitely think if you haven't
built<00:06:14.220> one<00:06:14.370> of<00:06:14.490> these<00:06:14.670> it's<00:06:15.320> absolutely<00:06:16.320> worth

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:16.530 
built one of these it's absolutely worth

00:06:16.530 --> 00:06:18.620 
built one of these it's absolutely worth
it<00:06:16.740> because<00:06:17.340> that's<00:06:18.150> the<00:06:18.300> thing<00:06:18.510> with

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
it because that's the thing with

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.060 
it because that's the thing with
building<00:06:18.990> building<00:06:19.560> different<00:06:19.680> cars<00:06:19.980> in

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
building building different cars in

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:22.340 
building building different cars in
Forza<00:06:20.600> sometimes<00:06:21.600> people<00:06:21.990> kind<00:06:22.110> of<00:06:22.200> say<00:06:22.320> oh

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:22.350 
Forza sometimes people kind of say oh

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:24.680 
Forza sometimes people kind of say oh
well<00:06:22.800> it<00:06:23.070> doesn't<00:06:23.460> it<00:06:23.700> doesn't<00:06:24.030> look<00:06:24.300> like<00:06:24.330> it

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
well it doesn't it doesn't look like it

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.240 
well it doesn't it doesn't look like it
would<00:06:24.750> fit<00:06:24.960> my<00:06:25.050> driving<00:06:25.290> style<00:06:25.500> or<00:06:25.890> oh<00:06:25.920> it

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
would fit my driving style or oh it

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.920 
would fit my driving style or oh it
doesn't<00:06:26.610> look<00:06:27.060> like<00:06:27.090> it<00:06:27.390> would<00:06:27.450> go<00:06:27.600> along<00:06:27.780> with

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:27.930 
doesn't look like it would go along with

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:29.300 
doesn't look like it would go along with
the<00:06:27.990> car<00:06:28.140> so<00:06:28.230> normally<00:06:28.530> drift<00:06:28.770> but<00:06:28.950> give<00:06:29.100> it<00:06:29.130> a

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
the car so normally drift but give it a

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:32.000 
the car so normally drift but give it a
give<00:06:29.880> it<00:06:29.970> a<00:06:30.030> try<00:06:30.240> give<00:06:30.750> it<00:06:30.930> a<00:06:30.990> shot<00:06:31.200> you<00:06:31.230> you

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
give it a try give it a shot you you

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.310 
give it a try give it a shot you you
might<00:06:32.310> be<00:06:32.520> really<00:06:33.420> really<00:06:33.660> surprised<00:06:34.080> you

00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:34.320 
might be really really surprised you

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.350 
might be really really surprised you
really<00:06:34.680> might<00:06:34.860> because<00:06:35.190> I<00:06:35.280> think<00:06:35.340> there's<00:06:36.270> a

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
really might because I think there's a

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.590 
really might because I think there's a
lot<00:06:36.630> of<00:06:36.750> cars<00:06:36.930> in<00:06:37.080> Forza<00:06:37.440> where<00:06:37.650> I've<00:06:38.600> I've
