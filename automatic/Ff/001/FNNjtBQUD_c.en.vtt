00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.300
 actually 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:18.969
 risks 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.950
 real activity 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.180
 he yes this game definitely should 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.620
 had to go to the open spaces of the game 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.710
 there is practically no industry in the world 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.890
 other more cool peresom run on 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.910
 the streets of the gangster area goes bad 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:01.690
 guys 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.250
 the Japanese company of those of us known for its 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.640
 addictions 2d bits moms whom she 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.210
 released more than a thousand by one only 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.010
 nations 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.880
 1908 sixth year released the game areas 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.370
 egypt on slot machines 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:15.850
 thereby starting a new series of games 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.900
 the game was about a schoolboy named 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.549
 Yakunin 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.270
 who have always plunged into various 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.360
 school disassembly 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.650
 and often got a pumpkin from Odessa street 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.350
 guys 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.180
 of course kudi is very strong 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.500
 and always answer bad guys 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.500
 reciprocating beating them and punching bags 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.830
 the game give birth to us is the port 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.230
 eponymous games with slot machines 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:37.830
 I must say that this game has been ported 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.460
 very many years and in accordance with her 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.920
 team 6 4 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.330
 all this is a master systems for expect rf 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.690
 and of course us 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.040
 before you start the review and justified 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.950
 I wanted to say hello to Russian gaming 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.380
 pirates 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.520
 what kind 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.350
 torero on how are all three injured 9 but also 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.829
 renamed the real name 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.490
 some games are bought up 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.560
 it's as ridiculous as a master chif 7 cm 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.180
 cartridge games and sir share rpc 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.440
 perhaps we will begin 

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.240
 The very first thing that catches your eye when 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.350
 turn on the game 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.899
 this wall is clearly not the biggest 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.140
 world cities and trash can 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.540
 which kind of hints at us 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.470
 game status 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.589
 that is, before 

00:02:14.589 --> 00:02:16.389
 although I will not agree yet 

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:18.239
 the reason for this is not yet 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.010
 really 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.490
 For the first time I see the developers 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.510
 dare to stand trash can nato this 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.639
 game acceleration 

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:24.869
 third day like 

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:26.639
 face wound game dramatically 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:28.359
 different from the rest of avakov bits 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.459
 its just going one way usually 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.759
 rights and killing brains from enemies 

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:34.269
 but everything is fixed on 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.250
 single site 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.560
 where to go set 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.690
 cloned enemies and we need from all of them 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:39.499
 fight off 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:41.549
 we can fight back in two ways 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:42.439
 first way 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.730
 this is the standard for a blow 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.659
 strike your timeline and when you press the buttons ii 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.639
 in this place a saiga kick 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:50.849
 the second way is grabs and coup 

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.319
 through the back 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:54.340
 they get completely random 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.280
 for the whole time of the game I never guessed 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.410
 the riddle of managing these grabs I 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.270
 just randomly pressed buttons order 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.019
 i didn't get by myself 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.419
 it seems everything is clear in this game as in 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:06.169
 any other broken need to drive again 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.759
 joystick settlement 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:09.189
 but it's not so easy 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.709
 difficulty begins in a dash of control 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.589
 remember i talked about standard punches 

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:15.509
 kicking 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:16.989
 here with such blows to kill the enemy 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.259
 impossible to explain why 

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:21.419
 then turned glory to the heroes of the spoils 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:23.889
 right side left why is it an act 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:25.649
 which was celebrated kick and he by the way 

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:27.289
 carry back only 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:28.969
 suddenly begins to answer for the blow 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:29.500
 by hand 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.490
 acb 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.410
 who was in charge of the punch starts 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:33.749
 answer for the final 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:35.449
 that is, the keys when turning the other 

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:36.569
 sides to the opposite 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:37.829
 is changing 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.959
 maybe it doesn't sound very convincing but 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:40.799
 believe me 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:42.349
 such control toir to be at all 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.039
 can't 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:44.719
 it's impossible to play 

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:46.389
 maybe the developers wanted to inject 

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:47.939
 introduction to diversity 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:50.110
 but it didn't work out like that 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:51.649
 it's just annoying 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:54.439
 saving only keystrokes together became 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:56.439
 be kicked in a jump 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.439
 as you progress through the level open 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.040
 the doors 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.489
 and each has a passage 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.790
 usually the far right door is taken there 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.310
 where have you been so go to the most 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.760
 Euro 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.599
 they lead to the next level 

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.139
 also occasionally come across a chamber with 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.559
 by which you can give 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.059
 opponent kicks dollars not one way to 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:15.069
 mid game 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.449
 after the second level there are places where necessary 

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:19.639
 fight off the bad guys on motorbikes 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.349
 this place reminded me very much 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:23.949
 the second part of the batman where we were about 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:24.990
 same 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.160
 after that, by the way, there is a level where necessary 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.309
 ride bikes beat enemies 

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:30.430
 also striking 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.520
 how such a theme has been solved 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.050
 beating a woman 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.680
 really really sorry 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.509
 Kokoity imbecile came up and without 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:39.289
 conversations started to hit in the face 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:42.289
 but as they say he was forced 

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:58.589
 it's time to go technical 

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:59.740
 the worth of the game 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.240
 for the beginning of the alphabet and music sounds of beats 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.289
 very typical debit afanasyev 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.690
 if you played such when was extended 

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.419
 paul sleep 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.349
 then surely the factory will seem to you very 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:10.180
 familiar 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:12.389
 In this regard, the kg does not find fault strong 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:13.249
 average check 

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:14.679
 but the music in the game is just 

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:17.679
 listen amazingly 

00:05:26.339 --> 00:05:28.849
 in my opinion it is very funny to get by 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.029
 this is of course fun if 

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:33.339
 getting inside i think that if this 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:35.129
 music translate your smith housewarming to 

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:35.830
 usual 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.830
 would look something like the truth 

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:44.079
 we really need 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:49.559
 report well 

00:05:49.559 --> 00:05:50.960
 order to play 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.199
 in fact this is one of the best sides of this 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:53.759
 games 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.589
 for 8 seventh year graphics just 

00:05:55.589 --> 00:05:57.800
 incomparably pressed again everything in 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.369
 heroes for the miscalculations of the world 

00:05:59.369 --> 00:06:02.210
 In general, in this regard, everything goes like clockwork 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.470
 but now because of what this game I do not 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:05.729
 recommend to anyone 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:06.719
 complexity 

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:08.330
 There are four levels in this game. 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:10.830
 Today it seems that the negotiations 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:11.580
 will go 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.680
 weather is a fig 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.599
 and all because of this control 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:16.499
 I don't know. Maybe my hands are furiously at my place. 

00:06:16.499 --> 00:06:18.809
 grow but I spent a bunch of nerves broke 

00:06:18.809 --> 00:06:21.319
 two joysticks held juice prefix and all 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:22.259
 in vain 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:24.139
 it's me just driving me crazy 

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:25.919
 sometimes you know that just run up 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.550
 kill completely 

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.960
 but all I have now is to give this 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.960
 games 

00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:50.050
 nice prize 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.349
 in fact very much delays from 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.310
 this big hassle if 

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.259
 the developers did at least manage by 

00:06:56.259 --> 00:06:58.729
 external certainly wounds was very 

00:06:58.729 --> 00:07:00.499
 even played 

00:07:00.499 --> 00:07:02.489
 it's just a very old virgin tripti 

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:03.610
 Lebedev 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:06.099
 with you was Vlad sour territory game
