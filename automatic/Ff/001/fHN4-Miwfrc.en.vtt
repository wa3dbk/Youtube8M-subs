00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 very good new video guys and girls from 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.040
 the news hunters today we present you the 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:10.650
 new trailer just out of the oven 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:13.590
 good warm up need for speed remember 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.560
 that we made another video presenting a 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:20.340
 mini piece of trailer that was presented 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.230
 in advance a couple of months ago and for 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.599
 end we have two and a half minutes 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.259
 complete for trailer of speed trailer 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.210
 we remember that the director is scott wall 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:33.269
 has directed as his last film 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.390
 act of courage in a war movie 

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:39.329
 so to the military a call of duty style 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.620
 and in this trailer we can see another 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.850
 new character that is michael keaton 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.350
 and well I also knew aaron paul like 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.480
 co-stars of 'breaking bad' series 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.360
 of successes with the emmy award for the best 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.820
 drama series 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.580
 and this nitro speed movie will do 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.440
 competition to fast and furious that more or 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:03.160
 except I think it has the same output 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.710
 of release in this case nor fresh pit 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.040
 will be released on March 14 , 2014 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.310
 I think fast and furious is about 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:16.340
 there there March around there was March 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.040
 April may such a thing will have 6 of 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.440
 March the same or a month apart 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.380
 waters I know that they are going to hit that without 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.979
 doubt they will crash lack support 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.869
 public already more than achieved but I think 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.740
 that the spin for that little dot say 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.360
 This has also been cured not 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:39.320
 think we're going to remember that fast and 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.510
 furious has a very curve 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.860
 very strong of what would come to be the 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.900
 first movies that were tuning 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.170
 until it has already happened to be of 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.630
 explosion action war we go a 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.760
 crystal jungle ' we could do so and 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:02:00.979
 by speed for what you can see in the 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.990
 trailer resembles more already racing a 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.869
 little can we say like that I 've seen a 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.630
 little to the game great tourism not a great 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:13.810
 tourism on one side of the infor speed and 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.810
 for fast and furious a spice of 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.920
 that is, the big cars without big 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.420
 authors that do what they do 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.239
 he wins already is that if the magazine last 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.069
 of fast and furious presumed or you see 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.920
 a tank will devour 100 meters for the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:32.579
 sky is songs has seen in life as well 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.959
 that nothing wrinkles me much of what counts 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:37.330
 but I think it 's information that is going to 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.710
 like that can bring something 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.230
 to your decision of d 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.290
 which is better 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.049
 so nothing I think that did not leave me anything 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.709
 good if the trailer you're going to see is 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.239
 mus music group 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.910
 the music has changed with respect to 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:59.130
 first trailer that there was in my fresh beat 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.080
 and so keep going guys if I leave you here 

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:04.080

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.900
