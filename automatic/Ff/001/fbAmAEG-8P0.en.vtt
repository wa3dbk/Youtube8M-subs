00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.520
 yes 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.680
 in the team that I'm going to present to you today 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.439
 he is the new member of the families 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.060
 in what is called assange 510 is a 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.130
 phone where we pretend 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.810
 define the average range of smartphones with 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.480
 a team that has characteristics 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.610
 higher, such as a screen 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:34.500
 ips resistance of glass gorilla 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.690
 4.5 inches we are going to also have a 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.239
 1.2 core dual processor 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.670
 gigahertz that's pretty good for 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.100
 this category of equipment and a memory 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.809
 of 4 gigs and something very interesting with 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.420
 this team and that is that we are going to have 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.850
 first time in colombia an interface that 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.699
 the same developed that is called emotion 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.140
 white and is a complement that huawei s 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.530
 about the android operating system in 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.320
 this case 4.1 in which we are going to give 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.979
 to the user more tools so that 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.500
 can personalize your cellphone then 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.270
 in this team highlights things like 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.170
 that I can have a single widget that we have 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.490
 called my widgets 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.159
 in which I can 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.170
 edit certain elements to be 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.030
 see on a single screen then I 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.770
 I can add or remove the elements that 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.799
 I want directly from the fringe 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.509
 from the bottom part other elements of 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.359
 personalization for example I already have a 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.850
 direct access profiles so that the use 

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.860
 the user select how he wants to be 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.689
 behave your phone in different 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.100
 scenarios this let's say it's also 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.850
 something that does not have the android version 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.610
 default 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.100
 something that has interesting the team is 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.580
 that I can change the transitions 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.040
 then I can say that select 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.630
 different ways in which the team is going to 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.110
 behave when I change between 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.200
 screens and if the screens 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.479
 I want to change them 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.250
 then I can come here and add or 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.840
 remove screens within the interface 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.260
 all these are the innovations that 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.960
 presents the emotion white interface 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.390
 on the other hand it is a team that has 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.240
 a 5 megapixel camera and it has 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.740
 double camera the camera that we have in the 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.430
 back that is 5 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.340
 megapixels has flash 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.769
 and it is a team that will allow us 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.840
 Take photos with good resolution and 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:28.340
 additionally for users of 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.319
 movistar where are we going to launch this 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.200
 product in white as you see it here 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.550
 we will have a gift of 2 as a gift 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.530
 gigas 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.850
 to expand the memory that comes by 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.850
 defect with the equipment 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.370
 do not 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.340
 another very interesting feature that 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.320
 has the team appreciate it from the 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.750
 back and that is to be able 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.250
 filter the noise of the environment and have 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.640
 a better quality 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.800
 in the voice then we have a microphone 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:11.440
 double located here at the bottom 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:13.210
 another one on top and the team 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.510
 has an algorithm to be able to do that 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.130
 voice quality is much better about 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:27.790
 everything in situations where we have a lot 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:29.230
 background noise we thank you very much for your 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.480
 invitation to the people of the planet 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.950
