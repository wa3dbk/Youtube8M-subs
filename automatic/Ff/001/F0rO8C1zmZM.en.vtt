joins us now in the studio to tell us
about<00:00:08.160> her<00:00:08.429> robot<00:00:08.760> who<00:00:08.940> does<00:00:09.120> just<00:00:09.540> that

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
about her robot who does just that

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.249 
about her robot who does just that
welcome<00:00:11.000> so<00:00:12.000> tell<00:00:12.240> us<00:00:12.269> about<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.660> robot<00:00:13.019> just

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
welcome so tell us about the robot just

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.470 
welcome so tell us about the robot just
generally<00:00:13.860> what<00:00:14.099> what<00:00:14.400> does<00:00:14.519> it<00:00:14.670> do<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.240> what

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
generally what what does it do and what

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.609 
generally what what does it do and what
are<00:00:15.570> some<00:00:15.599> of<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.900> features<00:00:16.080> that<00:00:16.500> you

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:16.619 
are some of the features that you

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.740 
are some of the features that you
designed<00:00:16.980> here<00:00:17.190> um<00:00:17.400> so<00:00:17.850> what<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.150> does<00:00:18.359> is<00:00:18.690> it

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
designed here um so what it does is it

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.140 
designed here um so what it does is it
can<00:00:19.260> navigate<00:00:19.439> autonomously<00:00:20.430> through<00:00:21.119> a

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
can navigate autonomously through a

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.750 
can navigate autonomously through a
hallway<00:00:21.510> blueprint<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.350> it<00:00:22.500> can<00:00:22.769> I<00:00:23.070> just<00:00:23.580> let

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
hallway blueprint so it can I just let

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.400 
hallway blueprint so it can I just let
it<00:00:23.789> go<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.240> it<00:00:24.359> navigates<00:00:24.720> all<00:00:24.930> by<00:00:25.080> itself

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
it go and it navigates all by itself

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.189 
it go and it navigates all by itself
through<00:00:25.830> hallways<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.900> while<00:00:27.900> it's<00:00:28.080> doing

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
through hallways and while it's doing

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.859 
through hallways and while it's doing
that<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.650> searches<00:00:29.039> for<00:00:29.189> people<00:00:29.519> using

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:29.869 
that it searches for people using

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:32.209 
that it searches for people using
infrared<00:00:30.869> camera<00:00:31.380> which<00:00:31.560> finds<00:00:31.890> them<00:00:32.040> based

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
infrared camera which finds them based

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.389 
infrared camera which finds them based
on<00:00:32.340> heat<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:33.420> if<00:00:33.660> there<00:00:33.870> was<00:00:34.140> hazardous<00:00:34.829> waste

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
on heat so if there was hazardous waste

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.200 
on heat so if there was hazardous waste
or<00:00:35.790> toxins<00:00:36.510> or<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.899> bomb<00:00:37.290> or<00:00:37.969> risk<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.120> the

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
or toxins or a bomb or risk of the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.520 
or toxins or a bomb or risk of the
building<00:00:39.480> falling<00:00:39.660> down<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.290> human

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
building falling down and a human

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.170 
building falling down and a human
searcher<00:00:40.950> couldn't<00:00:41.219> go<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.640> robot<00:00:41.879> can<00:00:42.000> go

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
searcher couldn't go in the robot can go

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.450 
searcher couldn't go in the robot can go
in<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.600> look<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.800> people<00:00:43.920> who<00:00:44.100> might<00:00:44.190> need<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
in and look for people who might need to

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.190 
in and look for people who might need to
be<00:00:44.520> rescued<00:00:44.820> and<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.809> seems<00:00:45.989> like<00:00:46.050> an

pictures of your robot and have you
explain<00:03:21.340> exactly<00:03:22.239> how<00:03:22.540> this<00:03:23.200> functions<00:03:23.410> how

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
explain exactly how this functions how

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.120 
explain exactly how this functions how
it<00:03:23.980> works<00:03:24.299> like<00:03:25.299> we<00:03:25.450> see<00:03:25.660> here<00:03:26.010> can<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.040> just

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
it works like we see here can you just

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.490 
it works like we see here can you just
kind<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.489> explain<00:03:27.910> what<00:03:28.239> this<00:03:28.420> device<00:03:29.260> is

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
kind of explain what this device is

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.229 
kind of explain what this device is
where<00:03:29.769> where<00:03:30.010> everything<00:03:30.370> is<00:03:30.489> on<00:03:30.610> here<00:03:30.790> so

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
where where everything is on here so

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:35.630 
where where everything is on here so
this<00:03:31.450> is<00:03:31.630> the<00:03:31.930> robot<00:03:32.140> um<00:03:32.560> his<00:03:33.070> name<00:03:33.280> is<00:03:33.459> leo<00:03:34.260> so

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
this is the robot um his name is leo so

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.460 
this is the robot um his name is leo so
he<00:03:36.640> has<00:03:36.730> two<00:03:36.910> main<00:03:37.120> sensors<00:03:37.600> on<00:03:37.870> the<00:03:37.930> two<00:03:38.320> on

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
he has two main sensors on the two on

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.759 
he has two main sensors on the two on
the<00:03:38.560> front<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:39.459> tan<00:03:39.820> sensor<00:03:40.390> that<00:03:40.660> says<00:03:40.959> sick

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
the front the tan sensor that says sick

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.160 
the front the tan sensor that says sick
on<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.130> front<00:03:42.489> is<00:03:43.030> a<00:03:43.090> lidar<00:03:43.450> laser<00:03:43.780> range

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
on the front is a lidar laser range

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.990 
on the front is a lidar laser range
sensor<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:44.860> what<00:03:44.980> that<00:03:45.010> does<00:03:45.340> is<00:03:45.370> it<00:03:45.610> sends<00:03:45.910> out

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
sensor so what that does is it sends out

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.170 
sensor so what that does is it sends out
laser<00:03:46.329> pulses<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.500> see<00:03:47.739> obstacles<00:03:48.160> and<00:03:48.790> walls

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
laser pulses to see obstacles and walls

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.330 
laser pulses to see obstacles and walls
in<00:03:49.600> the<00:03:49.720> environment<00:03:50.019> around<00:03:50.320> the<00:03:50.590> robot<00:03:50.890> so

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
in the environment around the robot so

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.729 
in the environment around the robot so
it<00:03:51.400> uses<00:03:51.549> that<00:03:51.700> to<00:03:51.820> navigate<00:03:52.239> and<00:03:52.450> then<00:03:53.110> the<00:03:53.470> on

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
it uses that to navigate and then the on

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.449 
it uses that to navigate and then the on
black<00:03:54.510> sensor<00:03:55.510> in<00:03:55.780> the<00:03:56.200> clear<00:03:56.560> box<00:03:56.799> is<00:03:57.280> an

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
black sensor in the clear box is an

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:00.270 
black sensor in the clear box is an
infrared<00:03:57.790> camera<00:03:57.880> which<00:03:58.630> senses<00:03:58.959> heat<00:03:59.260> so<00:03:59.920> it

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
infrared camera which senses heat so it

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.520 
infrared camera which senses heat so it
can<00:04:00.489> sense<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:00.880> heat<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.299> people<00:04:01.720> and<00:04:01.959> then

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
can sense the heat of people and then

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.440 
can sense the heat of people and then
also<00:04:02.680> there's<00:04:03.130> a<00:04:03.340> lot<00:04:03.700> of<00:04:03.730> electronic

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
also there's a lot of electronic

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.380 
also there's a lot of electronic
equipment<00:04:04.570> on<00:04:05.049> there<00:04:05.290> there's<00:04:05.620> computers

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
equipment on there there's computers

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.840 
equipment on there there's computers
there's<00:04:07.390> a<00:04:07.660> big<00:04:07.930> screen<00:04:08.350> that<00:04:08.739> displays

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:08.850 
there's a big screen that displays

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.729 
there's a big screen that displays
sensor<00:04:09.850> values<00:04:10.720> and<00:04:10.989> can<00:04:11.140> also<00:04:11.260> display<00:04:11.560> the

00:04:11.729 --> 00:04:11.739 
sensor values and can also display the

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.330 
sensor values and can also display the
coordinates<00:04:12.519> of<00:04:12.730> where<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.870> people<00:04:14.019> are<00:04:14.340> so

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
coordinates of where the people are so

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.360 
coordinates of where the people are so
yeah<00:04:16.329> that's<00:04:16.540> okay<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.560> how<00:04:17.709> does<00:04:17.769> Leo<00:04:18.130> get

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
yeah that's okay and how does Leo get

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.339 
yeah that's okay and how does Leo get
around<00:04:18.640> and<00:04:18.940> does<00:04:19.419> he<00:04:19.510> have<00:04:19.540> wheels<00:04:19.900> like<00:04:20.169> how

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:20.349 
around and does he have wheels like how

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:22.560 
around and does he have wheels like how
does<00:04:20.500> he<00:04:20.650> go<00:04:20.799> into<00:04:21.160> buildings<00:04:21.580> and<00:04:21.849> yes<00:04:22.060> he<00:04:22.390> has

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
does he go into buildings and yes he has

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.470 
does he go into buildings and yes he has
wheels<00:04:22.930> and<00:04:24.150> he's<00:04:25.150> given

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
wheels and he's given

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.990 
wheels and he's given
blueprint<00:04:26.080> beforehand<00:04:26.890> so<00:04:27.130> he<00:04:27.580> has<00:04:27.700> a<00:04:27.730> plan

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
blueprint beforehand so he has a plan

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.810 
blueprint beforehand so he has a plan
that<00:04:28.330> he's<00:04:28.450> supposed<00:04:28.690> to<00:04:28.840> traverse<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:30.130> then

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
that he's supposed to traverse and then

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.480 
that he's supposed to traverse and then
you<00:04:31.600> just<00:04:31.750> let<00:04:31.930> him<00:04:31.960> go<00:04:32.260> and<00:04:32.650> she<00:04:33.190> wheels

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
you just let him go and she wheels

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.910 
you just let him go and she wheels
around<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:34.420> building<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:35.110> then<00:04:35.530> is

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920 
around the building and then is

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.410 
around the building and then is
programmed<00:04:36.430> to<00:04:36.520> come<00:04:36.730> back<00:04:36.940> to<00:04:37.180> you<00:04:37.270> to

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
programmed to come back to you to

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.590 
programmed to come back to you to
purport<00:04:38.230> coordinates<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:39.250> did<00:04:40.090> this<00:04:40.180> is

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
purport coordinates and did this is

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.210 
purport coordinates and did this is
there<00:04:40.750> some<00:04:40.960> situation<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.860> gave<00:04:42.010> you<00:04:42.100> this

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:42.220 
there some situation that gave you this

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.880 
there some situation that gave you this
idea<00:04:42.400> did<00:04:42.700> you<00:04:42.820> see<00:04:43.200> something<00:04:44.200> where<00:04:44.560> this

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
idea did you see something where this

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.800 
idea did you see something where this
was<00:04:45.100> needed<00:04:45.460> or<00:04:45.580> how<00:04:45.700> did<00:04:45.880> you<00:04:46.060> come<00:04:46.510> up<00:04:46.540> with

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
was needed or how did you come up with

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.870 
was needed or how did you come up with
this<00:04:46.960> idea<00:04:47.110> in<00:04:47.350> particular<00:04:47.770> actually<00:04:48.580> there's

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
this idea in particular actually there's

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.060 
this idea in particular actually there's
a<00:04:48.970> huge<00:04:49.330> need<00:04:49.390> right<00:04:49.870> now<00:04:50.020> for<00:04:50.470> autonomous

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
a huge need right now for autonomous

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.880 
a huge need right now for autonomous
search<00:04:51.280> and<00:04:51.430> rescue<00:04:51.670> robots<00:04:52.000> because<00:04:52.930> having

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:53.890 
search and rescue robots because having

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.220 
search and rescue robots because having
a<00:04:53.980> robot<00:04:54.250> be<00:04:54.400> autonomous<00:04:54.670> is<00:04:55.240> really

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
a robot be autonomous is really

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.170 
a robot be autonomous is really
difficult<00:04:56.410> because<00:04:56.970> situations<00:04:57.970> can<00:04:58.120> be

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
difficult because situations can be

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.090 
difficult because situations can be
really<00:04:58.420> complicated<00:04:58.630> and<00:04:59.170> chaotic<00:04:59.680> and<00:04:59.860> the

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
really complicated and chaotic and the

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.470 
really complicated and chaotic and the
robot<00:05:00.340> needs<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.640> be<00:05:00.730> able<00:05:00.790> to<00:05:00.940> react<00:05:01.210> to

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:01.480 
robot needs to be able to react to

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:04.020 
robot needs to be able to react to
different<00:05:01.630> situations<00:05:01.980> so<00:05:02.980> right<00:05:03.220> now<00:05:03.250> a<00:05:03.730> lot

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
different situations so right now a lot

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.300 
different situations so right now a lot
of<00:05:04.060> robots<00:05:04.540> are<00:05:04.870> either<00:05:05.380> remote-controlled

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
of robots are either remote-controlled

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:09.270 
of robots are either remote-controlled
or<00:05:06.580> only<00:05:07.330> have<00:05:07.570> some<00:05:07.990> autonomous<00:05:08.740> properties

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
or only have some autonomous properties

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.120 
or only have some autonomous properties
when<00:05:09.730> they<00:05:10.090> are<00:05:10.470> actually<00:05:11.470> used<00:05:11.920> right<00:05:12.100> now

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
when they are actually used right now

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.880 
when they are actually used right now
for<00:05:12.250> search<00:05:12.640> and<00:05:12.670> rescue<00:05:12.760> situations<00:05:13.540> so<00:05:14.320> um

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
for search and rescue situations so um

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.340 
for search and rescue situations so um
building<00:05:15.850> an<00:05:16.030> autonomous<00:05:16.540> robot<00:05:16.870> is<00:05:17.050> really

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:17.350 
building an autonomous robot is really

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:19.200 
building an autonomous robot is really
helpful<00:05:17.620> because<00:05:17.950> then<00:05:18.190> if<00:05:18.730> there<00:05:18.910> is<00:05:19.030> some

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
helpful because then if there is some

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.270 
helpful because then if there is some
reason<00:05:19.330> why<00:05:19.660> you<00:05:20.260> can't<00:05:20.500> communicate<00:05:20.740> with

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
reason why you can't communicate with

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.060 
reason why you can't communicate with
the<00:05:21.400> robot<00:05:21.730> or<00:05:22.150> some<00:05:22.840> reason<00:05:23.020> why<00:05:23.470> you<00:05:23.980> know

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
the robot or some reason why you know

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.100 
the robot or some reason why you know
the<00:05:24.160> situation<00:05:24.580> is<00:05:24.670> too<00:05:24.910> chaotic<00:05:25.120> for<00:05:25.450> humans

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.110 
the situation is too chaotic for humans

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.210 
the situation is too chaotic for humans
to<00:05:26.350> really<00:05:26.920> um<00:05:27.660> have<00:05:28.660> a<00:05:29.020> good<00:05:29.110> grasp<00:05:29.830> on<00:05:30.160> the

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
to really um have a good grasp on the

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.850 
to really um have a good grasp on the
situation<00:05:30.510> having<00:05:31.510> an<00:05:31.690> autonomous<00:05:32.140> robot<00:05:32.530> can

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
situation having an autonomous robot can

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.040 
situation having an autonomous robot can
be<00:05:33.160> a<00:05:33.190> huge<00:05:33.460> advantage<00:05:33.850> to<00:05:34.390> finding<00:05:34.750> people

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
be a huge advantage to finding people

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
goes in there's these sensors of course

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.980 
goes in there's these sensors of course
but<00:05:44.800> also<00:05:44.830> he<00:05:45.370> can<00:05:45.550> print<00:05:45.940> out<00:05:46.090> the<00:05:46.390> images<00:05:46.540> of

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:46.990

what he sees in there is that one of the

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.460 
what he sees in there is that one of the
features<00:05:48.850> oh<00:05:49.180> yeah<00:05:49.600> we<00:05:49.810> actually<00:05:49.960> displays

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
features oh yeah we actually displays

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:53.460 
features oh yeah we actually displays
them<00:05:50.680> on<00:05:50.770> that<00:05:50.920> big<00:05:51.070> black<00:05:51.340> screen<00:05:51.820> so<00:05:52.720> he

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:53.470 
them on that big black screen so he

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.290 
them on that big black screen so he
displays<00:05:53.890> coordinates<00:05:54.550> that<00:05:54.850> he's<00:05:54.970> found<00:05:55.120> at

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
displays coordinates that he's found at

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.090 
displays coordinates that he's found at
the<00:05:55.390> people<00:05:55.660> but<00:05:55.780> also<00:05:55.840> as<00:05:56.500> he's<00:05:56.740> going<00:05:56.890> around
