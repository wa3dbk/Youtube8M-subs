00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:36.680
 the little words because I didn't tell her 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.680
 unbelievable little words but hot water 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:45.150
 Well I'm doing this training here 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.540
 here is a part of the arctic ocean yes 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:52.110
 located near the bay of resolute that 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.030
 is doing this test for a while 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.570
 also understand how to get out of cross the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.239
 these channels cost water channels that 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.360
 they can often form we say and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.900
 gladly in the arctic ocean 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:09.470
 practically right in the middle of the 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:12.390
 of the ocean in case there are any 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.880
 the only system to be able then 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.780
 cross over to the other side of the 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.040
 banch this qua epac practically 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.710
 iced aquamarine 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.590
 I have to cross the water 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.020
 temperature even if externally now 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.710
 at this time around 35 40 degrees 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.649
 below zero 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.890
 inside the water you do n't say that 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:37.729
 perception of cold cold understood also 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:43.259
 because the water is slightly warmer 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:47.579
 of the outside and to be however with col 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.590
 black water to know you have five and 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.070
 six hundred even 1000 meters deep 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.829
 under 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.609
 in short it is not a very sensation 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.619
 pleasant however the only system to be able to 

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:01.950
 cross and then continue the march 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.640
 now I come up and believe that for today it is 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.640
 more than enough 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.300
 hasta luego amigos comes out 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:23.390
 and then it only takes a few moments because everything 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.380
 the suit is obviously freezing water yes 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.380
 come back to chase
