00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.670
 Hi everyone, then you see me without make-up 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.759
 because today I decided to do the five 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.259
 minutes make up challenge or I have to 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.260
 play in five minutes 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:23.880
 I don't know if I'll make it see you then 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:37.980
 meanwhile I omit the two stopwatches 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:41.120
 Hair that's fine and 321 via 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.120
 let's see what comes out 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:57.010
 I don't know if I can do it 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.010
 past twenty seconds 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.530
 now I'm putting on a foundation if that 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:14.700
 you are interested here on which of the rimmel 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:18.179
 lasting finish 25 hours does not last 25 hours but 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.990
 however it lasts so long it is also a beautiful one 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:21.659
 power 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.179
 that is, it can then be modulated by dark circles 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.679
 and I put this here that the pixel wake me 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:31.189
 up that I had for dark circles because it is 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:31.189
 Orange 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:45.260
 anyway, I repeat if so i 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:47.720
 most used products you will see them you can 

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.900
 see in my mind ab routine in the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.900
 video of the friend 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.530
 then I put this ds here I knew of 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:02:03.120
 essence of kiko meant that it is the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:06.830
 make up to take over and here is precisely 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.830
 I can't really talk today 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.830
 I spent a minute and a half 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:17.660
 actually me in the morning there 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.500
 I put so much makeup on I don't know if there is 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:23.500
 I do if I put 5 puts the usual 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500
 we see 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.520
 brings us to the powder for all 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.310
 it turns out that for the transparent compact 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.709
 between essence music this time 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.500
 really be on the brand and this 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:43.340
 compact brush that of the sec now 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.340
 the one to travel minutes 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:56.720
 ok then body contouring of the bourgeois e 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.080
 the brush that is from the royal beauty 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.080
 I think 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.010
 all two and a half minutes 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.450
 a general blush of the lacquer 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.700
 here that always the same in reality 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:34.540
 I always see life from there 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:37.989
 it costs almost ending then then it must be done 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:43.440
 film the mascara that let it be 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.440
 But on the live streams, that's it 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.000
 with rota projection 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:04:00.090
 they also began to wear eyeliner 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:07.760
 not because he doesn't have time but why not 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.380
 can accept it I did three minutes e 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.380
 half 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.380
 that's enough 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.210
 we will put to work 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:33.360
 and almost 4 minutes where the highline is 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.360
 no it's not true I have to do eyebrows 

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:43.469
 we have a lot 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.600
 four minutes by 09 I can 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.980
 to put her also is explained in this way 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.980
 I make disasters 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:21.750
 having a disaster I made up for four 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:21.750
 minutes and 40 are the same 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.240
 4 52 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:43.809
 ok i did it, did it stop 

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:48.999
 five minutes and 3 seconds 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:50.889
 now I'll show you explain all the 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:54.819
 mornings I make up in five years 95 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:58.089
 minutes no but let's say that more or less is 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:06:01.569
 that duration but I must say that I had 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:03.519
 also quite well ie it seems 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:06.179
 normal as usual and now let's see 

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:06.179
 a moment 

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:11.469
 free 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.500
 satisfying is no is that the thing that i do 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.850
 no cocoa butter 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.850
 oh well I put it now anyway 

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:28.129
 overcome challenge I managed to touch myself 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.479
 five minutes I know I hope this 

00:06:28.129 --> 00:06:31.610
 video then we held you back 

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.589
 he certainly kept them company but 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:36.379
 who was very helpful just to make you 

00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:38.509
 know that I make up in 5 minutes and go 

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:42.189
