okay<00:00:01.349> I<00:00:01.649> gotta<00:00:02.490> take<00:00:02.639> this<00:00:03.680> setscrew<00:00:04.680> out

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
okay I gotta take this setscrew out

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.130 
okay I gotta take this setscrew out
right<00:00:05.550> here<00:00:05.880> you<00:00:06.060> don't<00:00:06.180> need<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.960> have

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
right here you don't need to have

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.329 
right here you don't need to have
anything<00:00:07.410> like<00:00:07.530> this<00:00:07.800> but<00:00:08.069> it's<00:00:08.759> pretty<00:00:08.910> easy

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:10.339 
anything like this but it's pretty easy

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.640 
anything like this but it's pretty easy
get<00:00:11.339> it<00:00:11.429> out<00:00:11.580> it's<00:00:11.820> just<00:00:11.849> this<00:00:12.059> little<00:00:12.650> set

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
get it out it's just this little set

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.320 
get it out it's just this little set
screw<00:00:13.679> that<00:00:14.369> kind<00:00:14.639> of<00:00:14.869> that<00:00:15.869> whole<00:00:16.049> jar

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.330 
screw that kind of that whole jar

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.630 
screw that kind of that whole jar
hold<00:00:18.330> your<00:00:18.539> rotor<00:00:19.500> on<00:00:19.859> so<00:00:20.340> that<00:00:20.519> it<00:00:20.609> doesn't

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
hold your rotor on so that it doesn't

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.929 
hold your rotor on so that it doesn't
spin<00:00:21.269> when<00:00:21.509> you're<00:00:21.630> trying<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.759> change<00:00:23.759> a<00:00:23.849> tire

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
spin when you're trying to change a tire

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.599 
spin when you're trying to change a tire
or<00:00:24.330> whatever<00:00:24.599> this<00:00:24.900> is<00:00:24.960> just<00:00:25.220> motor<00:00:26.220> itself

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
or whatever this is just motor itself

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.140 
or whatever this is just motor itself
held<00:00:27.060> on<00:00:27.269> mostly<00:00:28.140> by<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.349> lug<00:00:28.650> nuts<00:00:28.910> set<00:00:29.910> screw

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
held on mostly by the lug nuts set screw

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.240 
held on mostly by the lug nuts set screw
just<00:00:30.330> keeps<00:00:30.419> it<00:00:30.720> from<00:00:30.869> turning<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.560> as<00:00:32.130> you

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
just keeps it from turning but as you

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.580 
just keeps it from turning but as you
can<00:00:32.369> see<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.730> can't<00:00:33.030> get<00:00:33.180> it<00:00:33.300> out<00:00:33.590> quite

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
can see you can't get it out quite

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.000 
can see you can't get it out quite
because<00:00:35.219> this<00:00:35.399> I<00:00:36.180> guess<00:00:36.539> it's<00:00:36.690> like<00:00:36.809> a<00:00:37.010> carrier

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
because this I guess it's like a carrier

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.209 
because this I guess it's like a carrier
for<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:40.140> brake<00:00:40.350> pads<00:00:40.620> gets<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.039> the<00:00:41.100> way

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
for the the brake pads gets in the way

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.330 
for the the brake pads gets in the way
so<00:00:42.170> I've<00:00:43.170> gotta<00:00:43.379> loosen<00:00:43.620> those<00:00:43.829> up<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.219> this

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
so I've gotta loosen those up and this

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.279 
so I've gotta loosen those up and this
is<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.640> thing<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.879> takes<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:48.600> e<00:00:48.629> 18

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
is the thing that takes the the e 18

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.160 
is the thing that takes the the e 18
bolt<00:00:49.680> and<00:00:49.890> I'll<00:00:50.039> show<00:00:50.190> you<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> picture<00:00:50.489> of<00:00:50.670> that

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
bolt and I'll show you a picture of that

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.310 
bolt and I'll show you a picture of that
again<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.379> would<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.559> better<00:00:53.840> better<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:55.109> have

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
again it would be better better to have

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.759 
again it would be better better to have
a<00:00:58.160> be<00:00:59.160> better<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.609> have<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.820> ratchet<00:01:00.769> socket

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
a be better to have a ratchet socket

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.369 
a be better to have a ratchet socket
that<00:01:01.920> fit<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.219> there<00:01:02.340> although<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:03.379> this

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
that fit in there although this this

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:10.070 
that fit in there although this this
thing<00:01:04.650> fits<00:01:05.009> okay

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.750 

like<00:01:11.080> I<00:01:11.170> said<00:01:11.230> there's<00:01:11.560> a<00:01:11.650> lot<00:01:11.980> of<00:01:12.280> torque<00:01:12.580> on

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:12.760 
like I said there's a lot of torque on

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.340 
like I said there's a lot of torque on
that<00:01:12.790> bolt<00:01:13.150> so<00:01:13.360> I'm<00:01:13.420> gonna<00:01:13.600> and<00:01:13.900> there's<00:01:14.260> no

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
that bolt so I'm gonna and there's no

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.380 
that bolt so I'm gonna and there's no
way<00:01:14.530> I<00:01:14.560> could<00:01:14.800> do<00:01:14.980> it<00:01:15.160> make<00:01:15.970> sure<00:01:16.000> you<00:01:16.210> go<00:01:16.300> the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
way I could do it make sure you go the

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.290 
way I could do it make sure you go the
right<00:01:16.540> way<00:01:16.620> it's<00:01:17.620> up<00:01:18.660> yeah<00:01:20.160> so<00:01:21.160> there's<00:01:22.090> no<00:01:22.120> way

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
right way it's up yeah so there's no way

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:28.350 
right way it's up yeah so there's no way
you<00:01:22.390> can<00:01:22.570> do<00:01:22.750> it<00:01:24.480> like<00:01:25.480> that<00:01:27.030> make<00:01:28.030> sure<00:01:28.060> this

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
you can do it like that make sure this

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.360 
you can do it like that make sure this
is<00:01:28.540> really<00:01:28.780> on<00:01:29.020> there<00:01:29.229> solid<00:01:29.680> see<00:01:29.830> don't<00:01:30.070> strip

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:30.370 
is really on there solid see don't strip

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.370 
is really on there solid see don't strip
that<00:01:30.550> out<00:01:31.380> my<00:01:32.380> other<00:01:32.560> wrench<00:01:32.890> on<00:01:33.100> here<00:01:34.350> put<00:01:35.350> my

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
that out my other wrench on here put my

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:46.520 
that out my other wrench on here put my
knee<00:01:35.560> under<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:42.400> that's<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.450> lot<00:01:43.720> of<00:01:43.930> pressure

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.590 

and<00:01:47.530> then<00:01:47.650> it's<00:01:48.040> also<00:01:48.280> covered<00:01:48.790> with<00:01:48.940> Loctite

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
and then it's also covered with Loctite

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.460 
and then it's also covered with Loctite
so<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:51.490> doesn't<00:01:51.850> really<00:01:52.060> loosen<00:01:52.540> up<00:01:52.660> a<00:01:52.960> whole

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
so it doesn't really loosen up a whole

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.370 
so it doesn't really loosen up a whole
lot<00:01:53.680> even<00:01:53.890> when<00:01:54.009> it's<00:01:54.190> loose<00:01:54.460> so<00:01:54.960> it's<00:01:55.960> kind<00:01:56.320> of

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
lot even when it's loose so it's kind of

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.650 
lot even when it's loose so it's kind of
a<00:01:56.850> pain<00:01:57.850> in<00:01:57.970> the<00:01:58.000> butt<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:59.490> get<00:02:00.490> it<00:02:00.610> off<00:02:00.759> because

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
a pain in the butt to get it off because

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:28.280 
a pain in the butt to get it off because
it<00:02:01.869> just<00:02:02.259> doesn't<00:02:02.619> get<00:02:02.740> easy

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.860 

okay<00:02:29.290> so<00:02:29.350> this<00:02:29.680> is<00:02:30.000> by<00:02:31.000> far<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.300> hardest<00:02:31.450> part

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
okay so this is by far the hardest part

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.900 
okay so this is by far the hardest part
I<00:02:32.110> just<00:02:32.530> I<00:02:32.620> ended<00:02:32.890> up<00:02:32.950> taking<00:02:33.160> these<00:02:33.400> bolts<00:02:33.760> all

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
I just I ended up taking these bolts all

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.750 
I just I ended up taking these bolts all
the<00:02:34.000> way<00:02:34.120> out<00:02:34.270> because<00:02:34.480> I<00:02:34.600> couldn't<00:02:34.840> get<00:02:36.780> it

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
the way out because I couldn't get it

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.030 
the way out because I couldn't get it
you<00:02:39.760> see<00:02:39.970> they<00:02:40.090> got<00:02:40.230> covered<00:02:41.230> with<00:02:41.290> Loctite<00:02:41.830> it

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
you see they got covered with Loctite it

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.470 
you see they got covered with Loctite it
wouldn't<00:02:42.310> be<00:02:42.370> a<00:02:42.400> bad<00:02:42.580> idea<00:02:42.610> to<00:02:42.970> put<00:02:43.300> more

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
wouldn't be a bad idea to put more

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:50.270 
wouldn't be a bad idea to put more
Loctite<00:02:44.020> on<00:02:44.050> there<00:02:44.350> before<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.710> put<00:02:44.890> it<00:02:44.980> on

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.730 

there<00:02:51.310> okay<00:02:51.990> so<00:02:52.990> you<00:02:53.110> get<00:02:53.230> your<00:02:53.380> old<00:02:53.500> rotor<00:02:53.770> off

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
there okay so you get your old rotor off

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.410 
there okay so you get your old rotor off
okay<00:02:56.740> it's<00:02:57.040> really<00:02:57.790> important<00:02:58.270> you<00:02:58.330> don't

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
okay it's really important you don't

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.530 
okay it's really important you don't
this<00:02:58.630> is<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:58.810> new<00:02:59.340> disc<00:03:00.340> the<00:03:00.790> rotor<00:03:01.090> you<00:03:01.240> don't

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
this is the new disc the rotor you don't

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:10.800 
this is the new disc the rotor you don't
want<00:03:01.660> to<00:03:01.720> get<00:03:01.870> any<00:03:02.050> grease<00:03:02.910> WD<00:03:04.710> like<00:03:05.710> I<00:03:05.950> did

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:27.300 

go<00:03:11.680> in<00:03:11.830> there<00:03:16.290> use<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.530> set<00:03:17.800> screw<00:03:26.130> so<00:03:27.130> that's

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
go in there use that set screw so that's

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.130 
go in there use that set screw so that's
solid<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:27.940> would<00:03:28.120> just<00:03:28.239> reverse<00:03:28.450> everything

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
solid I would just reverse everything

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.490 
solid I would just reverse everything
we're<00:03:29.290> gonna<00:03:29.350> put<00:03:29.590> these<00:03:29.709> bolts<00:03:30.100> back<00:03:30.250> in<00:03:31.500> let

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
we're gonna put these bolts back in let

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:41.400 
we're gonna put these bolts back in let
me<00:03:32.560> do<00:03:32.680> that<00:03:34.410> get<00:03:35.410> those<00:03:37.470> bolts<00:03:40.319> tightened<00:03:41.319> up

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
me do that get those bolts tightened up

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:49.050 
me do that get those bolts tightened up
all<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.770> way<00:03:45.360> and<00:03:46.360> I'm<00:03:46.450> gonna<00:03:46.540> use<00:03:46.810> my<00:03:48.060> great

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
all the way and I'm gonna use my great

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.210 
all the way and I'm gonna use my great
big<00:03:49.239> extension<00:03:49.810> again<00:03:50.290> like<00:03:50.530> back<00:03:50.739> up<00:03:50.950> here

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
big extension again like back up here

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.729 
big extension again like back up here
you<00:03:51.600> really<00:03:52.600> want<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.870> make<00:03:52.959> sure<00:03:53.019> you<00:03:53.320> got<00:03:53.500> a

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
you really want to make sure you got a

00:03:53.739 --> 00:04:09.670 
you really want to make sure you got a
good<00:03:54.459> grip<00:03:55.800> before<00:03:56.800> you<00:03:57.160> twerk<00:03:57.970> it

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.920 

we're<00:04:10.680> a<00:04:10.710> good<00:04:11.340> torque<00:04:11.730> wrench<00:04:12.000> and<00:04:12.240> having

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
we're a good torque wrench and having

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.480 
we're a good torque wrench and having
the<00:04:13.020> right<00:04:13.140> socket<00:04:13.560> would<00:04:13.980> make<00:04:14.160> a<00:04:14.190> lot<00:04:14.460> of

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:14.490 
the right socket would make a lot of

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.120 
the right socket would make a lot of
sense<00:04:15.110> again<00:04:16.110> I<00:04:16.350> saw<00:04:16.560> in<00:04:16.680> the<00:04:16.769> internet<00:04:16.950> I

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
sense again I saw in the internet I

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.000 
sense again I saw in the internet I
think<00:04:17.220> is<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.580> hundred<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.090> twenty<00:04:18.390> foot

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.010 
think is a hundred and twenty foot

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:25.840 
think is a hundred and twenty foot
pounds<00:04:20.010> which<00:04:20.100> is<00:04:20.250> a<00:04:20.519> lot<00:04:20.790> of<00:04:20.820> a<00:04:21.620> lot<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.650> torque

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.130 

one<00:04:26.850> thing<00:04:27.060> you<00:04:27.180> want<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.420> do<00:04:27.570> before<00:04:27.930> we<00:04:27.960> get

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
one thing you want to do before we get

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.790 
one thing you want to do before we get
to<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.320> is<00:04:29.360> put<00:04:30.360> some<00:04:30.540> ear<00:04:30.810> stop<00:04:31.230> squeak

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
to that is put some ear stop squeak

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.570 
to that is put some ear stop squeak
stuff<00:04:32.600> on<00:04:33.600> and<00:04:34.140> you<00:04:34.890> know<00:04:34.980> they<00:04:35.130> sell<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.490> in

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
stuff on and you know they sell it in

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:41.020 
stuff on and you know they sell it in
bottles<00:04:35.850> or<00:04:36.240> little<00:04:38.120> packets<00:04:39.120> like<00:04:39.270> this<00:04:39.980> and

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
bottles or little packets like this and

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:45.320 
bottles or little packets like this and
I<00:04:42.140> you<00:04:43.140> know<00:04:43.260> I'm<00:04:43.380> pretty<00:04:43.620> sure<00:04:44.180> you<00:04:45.180> don't

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
I you know I'm pretty sure you don't

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.200 
I you know I'm pretty sure you don't
need<00:04:45.570> to<00:04:45.690> put<00:04:45.870> this<00:04:46.020> on<00:04:47.210> the<00:04:48.210> whole<00:04:48.540> brake<00:04:49.500> pad

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
need to put this on the whole brake pad

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.400 
need to put this on the whole brake pad
probably<00:04:51.210> just<00:04:51.420> the<00:04:51.570> part<00:04:51.810> where<00:04:51.990> it<00:04:52.110> touches

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
probably just the part where it touches

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:56.900 
probably just the part where it touches
the<00:04:52.590> caliper<00:04:53.220> but<00:04:54.290> what<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.440> hell<00:04:55.590> got<00:04:56.460> it<00:04:56.670> so

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:56.910 
the caliper but what the hell got it so

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.570 
the caliper but what the hell got it so
I'm<00:04:57.030> gonna<00:04:57.180> spread<00:04:57.570> it<00:04:57.630> on<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:59.070> whole<00:04:59.250> thing

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
I'm gonna spread it on the whole thing

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:03.560 
I'm gonna spread it on the whole thing
because<00:05:00.170> it's<00:05:01.170> one<00:05:01.350> thing<00:05:01.560> I<00:05:01.680> hate<00:05:02.670> its<00:05:02.970> brakes

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
because it's one thing I hate its brakes

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.540 
because it's one thing I hate its brakes
that<00:05:03.780> make<00:05:03.960> a<00:05:03.990> lot<00:05:04.200> of<00:05:04.260> noise<00:05:04.590> or<00:05:04.860> any<00:05:05.070> noise<00:05:05.310> at

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
that make a lot of noise or any noise at

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:11.090 
that make a lot of noise or any noise at
all<00:05:05.700> so

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:18.590 

that's<00:05:11.640> what<00:05:11.820> goes<00:05:12.000> on<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.240> back<00:05:16.160> now<00:05:17.600> caliper

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 
that's what goes on the back now caliper

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.170 
that's what goes on the back now caliper
which<00:05:18.990> we<00:05:19.140> already<00:05:19.320> squished<00:05:19.770> together<00:05:20.180> all

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:21.180 
which we already squished together all

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:28.430 
which we already squished together all
the<00:05:21.360> way<00:05:21.510> on<00:05:21.840> a<00:05:21.870> fit<00:05:23.150> right<00:05:24.150> over<00:05:24.630> that<00:05:27.440> you

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 
the way on a fit right over that you

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.270 
the way on a fit right over that you
squished<00:05:28.710> it<00:05:28.860> back<00:05:29.070> far<00:05:29.370> enough<00:05:30.590> did<00:05:31.590> you<00:05:32.070> take

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
squished it back far enough did you take

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:36.770 
squished it back far enough did you take
your<00:05:32.460> pins<00:05:33.770> put<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:34.830> in<00:05:34.950> from<00:05:35.130> the<00:05:35.220> back<00:05:35.780> one

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 
your pins put it in from the back one

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.550 
your pins put it in from the back one
side<00:05:37.050> at<00:05:37.230> a<00:05:37.260> time

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
side at a time

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.990 
side at a time
obviously

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.260 

find<00:05:44.000> your<00:05:44.240> star<00:05:45.080> tool<00:05:45.610> okay<00:05:46.610> so<00:05:46.670> you<00:05:47.000> get<00:05:47.120> this

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
find your star tool okay so you get this

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.900 
find your star tool okay so you get this
tight<00:05:47.540> I'm<00:05:48.530> just<00:05:48.710> gonna<00:05:48.830> put<00:05:49.340> a<00:05:49.400> little<00:05:49.580> bit<00:05:49.820> of

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
tight I'm just gonna put a little bit of

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:57.430 
tight I'm just gonna put a little bit of
torque<00:05:50.180> on<00:05:50.360> them<00:05:50.480> like<00:05:51.110> that<00:05:55.870> that<00:05:56.870> I'm<00:05:57.170> sure

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:57.440 
torque on them like that that I'm sure

00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.920 
torque on them like that that I'm sure
they're<00:05:58.280> factory<00:05:58.790> specs<00:05:59.150> you<00:05:59.630> should<00:05:59.810> all

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
they're factory specs you should all

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:06.220 
they're factory specs you should all
look<00:06:00.110> up<00:06:03.040> put<00:06:04.040> our<00:06:04.130> rubber<00:06:04.340> caps<00:06:05.050> back<00:06:06.050> on

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:06.230 
look up put our rubber caps back on

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:08.140 
look up put our rubber caps back on
their<00:06:06.410> backsides<00:06:07.010> they<00:06:07.340> don't<00:06:07.520> get<00:06:07.700> full<00:06:08.000> of

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:08.150 
their backsides they don't get full of

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:17.440 
their backsides they don't get full of
crap<00:06:10.090> then<00:06:12.430> this<00:06:13.430> spring<00:06:14.300> thing<00:06:14.780> a<00:06:16.390> lot<00:06:17.390> of

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:17.450 
crap then this spring thing a lot of

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:21.070 
crap then this spring thing a lot of
people<00:06:17.780> do<00:06:18.550> but<00:06:19.550> I<00:06:19.820> think<00:06:20.480> there's<00:06:20.630> a<00:06:20.720> special

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.080 
people do but I think there's a special

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:28.180 
people do but I think there's a special
tool<00:06:21.380> you<00:06:21.590> can<00:06:21.740> buy<00:06:22.540> for<00:06:23.540> this<00:06:25.540> but<00:06:26.540> I<00:06:27.190> found

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:28.190 
tool you can buy for this but I found

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.420 
tool you can buy for this but I found
that<00:06:29.020> just<00:06:30.020> horsing<00:06:30.770> it<00:06:31.010> on<00:06:31.130> with<00:06:31.400> a

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:31.430 
that just horsing it on with a

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:54.040 
that just horsing it on with a
screwdriver<00:06:43.600> like<00:06:44.600> that<00:06:46.060> was<00:06:47.060> a<00:06:47.090> lot<00:06:47.270> easier

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:54.050 

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:56.179 

you're<00:06:55.050> gonna<00:06:55.169> want<00:06:55.409> to<00:06:55.439> go<00:06:55.589> pump<00:06:55.830> the<00:06:56.009> brake
