difference<00:00:14.590> we<00:00:14.770> turn<00:00:15.010> to<00:00:15.299> one<00:00:17.100> guy<00:00:19.800> what<00:00:20.800> about

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:20.890 
difference we turn to one guy what about

difference we turn to one guy what about
purses<00:00:21.520> then<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.480> pretty<00:00:25.750> much<00:00:25.929> when<00:00:26.890> you<00:00:27.519> go

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
purses then and pretty much when you go

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.599 
purses then and pretty much when you go
to<00:00:27.789> take<00:00:28.119> it<00:00:28.179> all<00:00:28.449> to<00:00:28.660> go<00:00:29.050> get<00:00:29.199> rebuilt<00:00:29.500> why<00:00:30.490> am

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:30.609 
to take it all to go get rebuilt why am

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:32.940 
to take it all to go get rebuilt why am
I<00:00:30.699> looking<00:00:30.820> at<00:00:30.970> the<00:00:31.119> screen

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
I looking at the screen

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.120 
I looking at the screen
I<00:00:32.980> look<00:00:33.850> like<00:00:33.880> an<00:00:34.150> Ansel<00:00:34.830> pretty<00:00:35.830> much<00:00:35.950> when

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:36.130 
I look like an Ansel pretty much when

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:39.990 
I look like an Ansel pretty much when
you<00:00:36.570> get<00:00:37.570> it<00:00:37.660> all<00:00:37.810> today<00:00:37.840> and<00:00:38.050> rebuilt<00:00:38.789> this<00:00:39.789> is

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
you get it all today and rebuilt this is

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.700 
you get it all today and rebuilt this is
pretty<00:00:40.210> much<00:00:40.300> what<00:00:40.600> they<00:00:40.719> do<00:00:40.780> they<00:00:41.350> replace

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:41.710 
pretty much what they do they replace

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.549 
pretty much what they do they replace
the<00:00:41.890> brushes<00:00:42.239> then<00:00:43.239> replace<00:00:43.539> those<00:00:43.809> slip

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
the brushes then replace those slip

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:47.160 
the brushes then replace those slip
rings<00:00:44.770> and<00:00:45.550> I<00:00:45.699> talked<00:00:45.940> about<00:00:46.090> my<00:00:46.239> other<00:00:46.510> post<00:00:46.899> I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
rings and I talked about my other post I

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.250 
rings and I talked about my other post I
don't<00:00:47.379> have<00:00:47.500> a<00:00:47.559> video<00:00:47.739> of<00:00:48.010> the<00:00:49.020> picture<00:00:50.020> of<00:00:50.110> it

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:50.260 
don't have a video of the picture of it

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.889 
don't have a video of the picture of it
having<00:00:50.620> it<00:00:50.710> next<00:00:51.010> time<00:00:51.329> probably<00:00:52.329> when<00:00:52.690> I<00:00:52.719> go

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
having it next time probably when I go

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.189 
having it next time probably when I go
to<00:00:52.960> install<00:00:53.350> this<00:00:53.590> I'll<00:00:54.520> probably<00:00:54.670> do<00:00:54.969> a<00:00:55.000> video

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
to install this I'll probably do a video

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.049 
to install this I'll probably do a video
show<00:00:56.199> you<00:00:56.260> what<00:00:56.469> it<00:00:56.590> is<00:00:56.620> before<00:00:56.980> I<00:00:57.190> do<00:00:57.250> it<00:00:57.550> for

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
show you what it is before I do it for

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.490 
show you what it is before I do it for
and<00:00:58.210> hats<00:00:58.359> are<00:00:58.510> again<00:00:58.719> I'm<00:00:59.019> a<00:00:59.140> probably<00:00:59.410> a

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
and hats are again I'm a probably a

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:10.590 
and hats are again I'm a probably a
pretty<00:01:01.649> but<00:01:02.910> we'd<00:01:03.910> say<00:01:08.730> sorry<00:01:09.730> if<00:01:10.060> you<00:01:10.420> guys

pretty but we'd say sorry if you guys
are<00:01:10.869> picking<00:01:11.020> up<00:01:11.229> any<00:01:11.380> kind<00:01:11.590> of<00:01:11.650> outside<00:01:11.799> noise

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
are picking up any kind of outside noise

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.640 
are picking up any kind of outside noise
couple<00:01:14.590> of<00:01:14.680> mechanics<00:01:15.130> moved<00:01:15.369> in<00:01:16.650> he's

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
couple of mechanics moved in he's

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.649 
couple of mechanics moved in he's
working<00:01:18.009> on<00:01:18.130> things<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.590> pretty<00:01:20.830> much<00:01:21.009> my

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
working on things so pretty much my

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:33.450 
working on things so pretty much my
solder

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:33.460 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.130 

so<00:01:34.460> I<00:01:34.490> hope<00:01:36.040> so

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
so I hope so

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.830 
so I hope so
in<00:01:39.140> here<00:01:41.800> in<00:01:42.800> here<00:01:43.090> so<00:01:44.090> here's<00:01:44.390> the<00:01:44.600> brush

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
in here in here so here's the brush

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.390 
in here in here so here's the brush
right<00:01:45.760> in<00:01:46.760> here<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:47.480> spring<00:01:51.040> underneath<00:01:52.040> it

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
right in here is spring underneath it

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.940 
right in here is spring underneath it
right<00:01:54.790> so<00:01:55.790> spring<00:01:56.270> comes<00:01:56.450> down<00:01:56.660> and<00:01:56.930> then<00:01:57.800> the

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
right so spring comes down and then the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.270 
right so spring comes down and then the
wire<00:01:58.100> shoots<00:01:58.580> across<00:01:58.670> I<00:01:59.830> broke<00:02:00.830> this<00:02:00.980> little

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
wire shoots across I broke this little

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.910 
wire shoots across I broke this little
tab<00:02:01.490> trying<00:02:01.850> to<00:02:01.910> get<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.090> other<00:02:02.240> one<00:02:02.390> out<00:02:02.920> bad

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
tab trying to get the other one out bad

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:18.940 
tab trying to get the other one out bad
idea<00:02:04.330> but<00:02:05.330> on<00:02:05.600> the<00:02:05.960> end<00:02:06.430> see<00:02:07.430> mine

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:26.229 

say<00:02:20.180> Parkinson's<00:02:21.180> that

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:26.239 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:32.989 

okay<00:02:27.680> much<00:02:28.680> easier<00:02:30.769> so<00:02:31.769> the<00:02:32.040> spring<00:02:32.370> though

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:32.999 
okay much easier so the spring though

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:37.339 
okay much easier so the spring though
it's<00:02:33.590> down<00:02:34.590> here<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:36.480> was<00:02:36.629> slow<00:02:36.840> shaft<00:02:37.139> here

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
it's down here that was slow shaft here

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.470 
it's down here that was slow shaft here
and<00:02:38.900> then<00:02:39.900> the<00:02:40.019> wire<00:02:40.230> goes<00:02:40.560> down<00:02:40.769> in<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.480> come

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
and then the wire goes down in it come

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.330 
and then the wire goes down in it come
back<00:02:42.689> a<00:02:42.900> little<00:02:43.019> installation<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.010> if<00:02:44.159> there's

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
back a little installation so if there's

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.379 
back a little installation so if there's
a<00:02:44.370> ground<00:02:44.639> so<00:02:44.879> far<00:02:44.909> and<00:02:47.120> travels<00:02:48.120> through<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:48.389 
a ground so far and travels through the

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:54.129 
a ground so far and travels through the
wire<00:02:48.569> and<00:02:49.010> then<00:02:50.010> my<00:02:50.280> awesome<00:02:50.819> soldering<00:02:51.180> job

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:54.139 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.849 

that's<00:02:55.139> not<00:02:55.469> fun<00:02:55.799> so<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:57.540> heated<00:02:57.930> up<00:02:58.169> the<00:02:58.469> wire

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
that's not fun so I heated up the wire

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:01.819 
that's not fun so I heated up the wire
and<00:02:59.219> saw<00:02:59.639> that<00:02:59.879> I<00:03:00.000> was<00:03:00.150> already<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.719> that<00:03:00.900> and

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
and saw that I was already on that and

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.490 
and saw that I was already on that and
up<00:03:01.950> it's<00:03:02.129> immoral<00:03:02.750> so<00:03:03.750> now<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.900> know<00:03:04.139> just<00:03:04.379> got

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
up it's immoral so now I know just got

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.790 
up it's immoral so now I know just got
to<00:03:04.590> take<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.799> little<00:03:04.980> pigtail

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:24.050 

and<00:03:12.440> beautiful<00:03:13.440> cutters<00:03:14.600> okay<00:03:15.630> wire<00:03:16.140> cutters

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.030 

there's<00:03:25.060> already<00:03:25.209> some<00:03:25.510> solder<00:03:25.720> on<00:03:25.840> here<00:03:26.170> by

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
there's already some solder on here by

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:34.280 
there's already some solder on here by
universal<00:03:27.700> fun<00:03:30.000> um<00:03:31.319> yeah<00:03:32.319> it's<00:03:32.590> works<00:03:32.890> for<00:03:33.099> me

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
so if you have done installation only

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.179 
so if you have done installation only
talked<00:03:41.799> about<00:03:42.159> the<00:03:42.310> bottom<00:03:42.840> and<00:03:43.980> while<00:03:44.980> it's

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:45.189 
talked about the bottom and while it's

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:47.789 
talked about the bottom and while it's
it<00:03:45.340> it's<00:03:46.269> writing<00:03:46.569> on<00:03:46.659> the<00:03:46.720> brush<00:03:46.989> okay<00:03:47.439> I<00:03:47.470> said

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
it it's writing on the brush okay I said

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:52.500 
it it's writing on the brush okay I said
probably<00:03:48.549> about<00:03:48.760> you<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:51.060> alright<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.359> it

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
probably about you so alright and it

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.369 
probably about you so alright and it
really<00:03:52.689> doesn't<00:03:53.069> even<00:03:54.069> touch<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:55.230> we<00:03:56.230> know

00:03:56.369 --> 00:03:56.379

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
highly down it'll be that far I probably

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.430 
said about here I mean if if I was
really<00:04:16.359> paranoid<00:04:16.570> about<00:04:16.959> it

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
really paranoid about it

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.740 
really paranoid about it
I<00:04:18.900> could<00:04:19.900> put<00:04:20.079> some<00:04:20.109> black<00:04:20.410> tea

are now in this one let's pull that down
just<00:04:50.380> don't<00:04:51.380> leave<00:04:51.530> it<00:04:51.800> I<00:04:52.010> thought<00:04:52.910> it<00:04:53.000> won't

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
just don't leave it I thought it won't

cut<00:04:53.300> the<00:04:53.330> other<00:04:53.570> one<00:04:53.750> back

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.600 

well<00:05:11.669> he's<00:05:12.300> probably<00:05:12.449> like<00:05:12.749> at<00:05:12.930> sixty<00:05:13.610> and

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:14.610 
well he's probably like at sixty and

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:17.800 
well he's probably like at sixty and
then<00:05:14.729> contain<00:05:15.090> that<00:05:15.240> wire<00:05:15.419> and<00:05:15.689> this<00:05:16.590> other

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
then contain that wire and this other

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:24.260 
then contain that wire and this other
other<00:05:18.810> line<00:05:22.490> that's<00:05:23.490> a<00:05:23.610> big<00:05:23.759> improvement<00:05:24.029> on

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270
