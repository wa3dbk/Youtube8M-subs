software macro versus not an in-game
with<00:00:18.910> a<00:00:18.939> walker<00:00:19.150> of<00:00:19.300> macro<00:00:19.720> this<00:00:20.410> is<00:00:20.560> a<00:00:20.590> macro

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
with a walker of macro this is a macro

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.100 
with a walker of macro this is a macro
for<00:00:21.910> you<00:00:22.000> guys<00:00:22.150> out<00:00:22.390> there<00:00:22.420> who<00:00:22.690> have<00:00:22.870> any

software like raises sign ups or any
late<00:00:26.380> Logitech<00:00:27.369> equivalent<00:00:27.880> or<00:00:28.030> any<00:00:28.270> other

late Logitech equivalent or any other

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:29.970 
late Logitech equivalent or any other
equivalent<00:00:28.990> that<00:00:29.140> doesn't<00:00:29.560> require<00:00:29.770> you<00:00:29.949> to

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
equivalent that doesn't require you to

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.100 
equivalent that doesn't require you to
have<00:00:30.100> a<00:00:30.460> Logitech<00:00:31.180> mouse<00:00:31.330> or<00:00:31.570> a<00:00:31.600> razer<00:00:31.840> mouse

because<00:00:32.890> this<00:00:33.039> is<00:00:33.160> a<00:00:33.190> macro<00:00:33.640> which<00:00:34.239> is<00:00:34.449> going

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:34.570 
because this is a macro which is going

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.009 
because this is a macro which is going
to<00:00:34.629> do<00:00:34.750> two<00:00:34.989> things<00:00:35.020> at<00:00:35.409> once<00:00:36.539> but<00:00:37.539> not<00:00:37.809> within

00:00:38.009 --> 00:00:38.019 
to do two things at once but not within

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:39.720 
to do two things at once but not within
the<00:00:38.170> in-game<00:00:38.499> macro<00:00:38.980> system<00:00:39.339> because<00:00:39.579> that

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
the in-game macro system because that

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.290 
the in-game macro system because that
doesn't<00:00:40.059> work<00:00:40.769> what<00:00:41.769> the<00:00:41.949> macro<00:00:42.339> does<00:00:42.579> is<00:00:42.850> it

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:43.300 
doesn't work what the macro does is it

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.439 
doesn't work what the macro does is it
uses<00:00:43.629> a<00:00:44.309> abilities<00:00:45.309> basically<00:00:45.789> within<00:00:46.210> one

00:00:46.439 --> 00:00:46.449 
uses a abilities basically within one

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:48.329 
uses a abilities basically within one
key<00:00:46.659> bind<00:00:46.899> it<00:00:47.140> will<00:00:47.289> use<00:00:47.469> obliterate<00:00:48.159> or

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:48.339 
key bind it will use obliterate or

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:50.520 
key bind it will use obliterate or
plague<00:00:48.760> leech<00:00:49.030> depending<00:00:49.899> on<00:00:50.019> which<00:00:50.199> you<00:00:50.379> can

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
plague leech depending on which you can

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.180 
plague leech depending on which you can
use<00:00:50.739> at<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.190> time<00:00:51.550> so<00:00:52.649> if<00:00:53.649> for<00:00:53.769> instance<00:00:53.829> you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
use at that time so if for instance you

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.979 
use at that time so if for instance you
know<00:00:54.280> when<00:00:54.460> you<00:00:54.519> bind<00:00:54.699> them<00:00:54.850> into<00:00:55.239> two<00:00:55.600> macros

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
know when you bind them into two macros

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:57.270 
know when you bind them into two macros
it<00:00:56.170> won't<00:00:56.319> work<00:00:56.499> because<00:00:56.679> they're<00:00:56.979> both<00:00:57.159> from

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
it won't work because they're both from

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.610 
it won't work because they're both from
a<00:00:57.370> global<00:00:57.670> cooldown<00:00:57.850> you<00:00:58.179> can<00:00:58.389> do<00:00:58.629> var<00:00:58.809> border

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
a global cooldown you can do var border

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:01.020 
a global cooldown you can do var border
and<00:00:59.739> what<00:00:59.889> will<00:01:00.100> happen<00:01:00.460> is<00:01:00.579> basically<00:01:00.819> when

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
and what will happen is basically when

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.219 
and what will happen is basically when
you're<00:01:01.149> using<00:01:01.299> the<00:01:01.449> obliterates<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.170> you

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
you're using the obliterates and you

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.350 
you're using the obliterates and you
don't<00:01:02.469> have<00:01:02.649> enough<00:01:02.859> runes<00:01:03.269> you<00:01:04.269> have

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
don't have enough runes you have

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.060 
don't have enough runes you have
basically<00:01:04.750> imagine<00:01:05.110> you<00:01:05.440> know<00:01:05.530> you<00:01:05.680> spamming

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
basically imagine you know you spamming

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.499 
basically imagine you know you spamming
you<00:01:06.130> obliterate<00:01:06.430> you<00:01:06.549> Daphne<00:01:06.850> ruins<00:01:07.119> now<00:01:07.299> if

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
you obliterate you Daphne ruins now if

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:09.990 
you obliterate you Daphne ruins now if
you<00:01:08.159> normally<00:01:09.159> you<00:01:09.280> know<00:01:09.399> you<00:01:09.460> keep<00:01:09.700> pressing

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:10.000 
you normally you know you keep pressing

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.690 
you normally you know you keep pressing
it<00:01:10.270> and<00:01:10.890> nothing<00:01:11.890> will<00:01:12.039> nothing<00:01:12.280> will<00:01:12.549> happen

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700 
it and nothing will nothing will happen

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.190 
it and nothing will nothing will happen
with<00:01:12.939> the<00:01:13.030> plate<00:01:13.210> later<00:01:13.450> macro<00:01:13.689> in<00:01:13.810> there<00:01:13.990> so

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
with the plate later macro in there so

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.620 
with the plate later macro in there so
even<00:01:14.619> if<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:14.950> can<00:01:15.189> use<00:01:15.549> the<00:01:15.729> obliterate<00:01:16.509> with

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
even if you can use the obliterate with

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.660 
even if you can use the obliterate with
the<00:01:16.719> first<00:01:16.960> line<00:01:17.289> of<00:01:17.320> the<00:01:17.530> macro<00:01:17.920> you<00:01:18.430> can't

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
the first line of the macro you can't

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.399 
the first line of the macro you can't
use<00:01:18.820> for<00:01:19.000> second<00:01:19.359> line<00:01:19.450> which<00:01:19.600> is<00:01:19.750> like<00:01:20.020> a<00:01:20.229> make

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409 
use for second line which is like a make

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:21.929 
use for second line which is like a make
take<00:01:20.649> but<00:01:20.979> oh<00:01:21.009> well<00:01:21.280> I<00:01:21.399> suppose<00:01:21.460> it<00:01:21.820> makes

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
take but oh well I suppose it makes

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.849 
take but oh well I suppose it makes
sense<00:01:22.060> but<00:01:23.049> with<00:01:23.170> this<00:01:23.259> software<00:01:23.530> like<00:01:23.740> this

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:23.859 
sense but with this software like this

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:25.170 
sense but with this software like this
you<00:01:24.009> will<00:01:24.159> be<00:01:24.310> able<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:24.549> use<00:01:24.700> it<00:01:24.820> so<00:01:24.969> you're

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
you will be able to use it so you're

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.670 
you will be able to use it so you're
spamming<00:01:25.539> in<00:01:25.630> the<00:01:25.689> obliterates<00:01:26.170> but<00:01:26.619> you

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
spamming in the obliterates but you

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:27.810 
spamming in the obliterates but you
can't<00:01:26.890> use<00:01:27.070> it<00:01:27.219> because<00:01:27.310> you<00:01:27.460> have<00:01:27.609> fraught

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
can't use it because you have fraught

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.819 
can't use it because you have fraught
you'd<00:01:28.240> have<00:01:28.390> any<00:01:28.479> rooms<00:01:28.780> what<00:01:29.439> this<00:01:29.560> will<00:01:29.710> do

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:29.829 
you'd have any rooms what this will do

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.789 
you'd have any rooms what this will do
is<00:01:30.009> it<00:01:30.100> will<00:01:30.130> also<00:01:30.430> use<00:01:31.000> plague<00:01:31.420> leech<00:01:31.799> within

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
is it will also use plague leech within

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.950 
is it will also use plague leech within
the<00:01:32.890> same<00:01:33.130> key<00:01:33.340> bind<00:01:33.609> so<00:01:34.149> whenever<00:01:34.539> you<00:01:34.810> can

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
the same key bind so whenever you can

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.029 
the same key bind so whenever you can
use<00:01:35.140> plague<00:01:35.320> lychee<00:01:35.649> we<00:01:35.740> use<00:01:35.920> it

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
use plague lychee we use it

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:37.560 
use plague lychee we use it
automatically<00:01:36.579> so<00:01:36.850> don't<00:01:37.060> you<00:01:37.210> don't<00:01:37.390> need<00:01:37.450> to

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
automatically so don't you don't need to

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.349 
automatically so don't you don't need to
bind<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:37.899> to<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.049> separate<00:01:38.350> key<00:01:38.530> you<00:01:38.619> bind<00:01:38.829> and

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:39.359 
bind it to a separate key you bind and

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:42.120 
bind it to a separate key you bind and
you<00:01:40.359> know<00:01:40.479> you<00:01:40.539> don't<00:01:40.840> necessarily<00:01:41.590> have<00:01:42.009> to

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
you know you don't necessarily have to

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.440 
you know you don't necessarily have to
think<00:01:42.369> about<00:01:42.460> it<00:01:42.670> too<00:01:42.789> much<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:43.179> will<00:01:43.240> just

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 
think about it too much it will just

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.810 
think about it too much it will just
automatically<00:01:44.109> happen<00:01:44.500> whenever<00:01:45.189> you're<00:01:45.490> use

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:45.820 
automatically happen whenever you're use

you actually using a blu-ray like you
know<00:03:24.500> for<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.739> key<00:03:24.889> presses<00:03:25.250> where<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.459> press

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:25.669 
know for the key presses where you press

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:26.920 
know for the key presses where you press
late<00:03:25.879> for<00:03:26.060> instance<00:03:26.329> now<00:03:26.510> I'm<00:03:26.629> gonna<00:03:26.750> press

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
late for instance now I'm gonna press

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.530 
late for instance now I'm gonna press
for<00:03:27.230> strike<00:03:27.560> and<00:03:28.190> I<00:03:28.250> first<00:03:28.489> warden<00:03:28.819> like<00:03:29.329> I<00:03:29.480> am

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
for strike and I first warden like I am

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.619 
for strike and I first warden like I am
now<00:03:29.750> I<00:03:30.129> just<00:03:31.129> get<00:03:31.220> this<00:03:31.280> little<00:03:31.430> flash<00:03:31.879> it

00:03:32.619 --> 00:03:32.629 
now I just get this little flash it

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.479 
now I just get this little flash it
doesn't<00:03:32.840> make<00:03:32.959> any<00:03:33.109> sense<00:03:33.470> at<00:03:33.590> all<00:03:33.709> so<00:03:34.370> I'm

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
doesn't make any sense at all so I'm

close in on plague leach I'm gonna spam

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.110 
close in on plague leach I'm gonna spam
the<00:03:39.169> obliterate<00:03:39.650> macro<00:03:40.069> and<00:03:40.250> it's<00:03:40.579> basically

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 
the obliterate macro and it's basically

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.770 
the obliterate macro and it's basically
you<00:03:41.810> will<00:03:41.930> not<00:03:42.079> see<00:03:42.349> it<00:03:42.620> pressed<00:03:43.010> down<00:03:43.329> like<00:03:44.329> it

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
you will not see it pressed down like it

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.140 
you will not see it pressed down like it
should<00:03:45.079> do<00:03:45.260> if<00:03:45.349> it<00:03:45.470> sees<00:03:45.620> like<00:03:45.709> this<00:03:46.040> on<00:03:46.310> look

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
should do if it sees like this on look

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.180 
should do if it sees like this on look
at<00:03:47.269> frustrate<00:03:47.690> it's<00:03:47.870> game<00:03:48.049> pressed<00:03:48.440> in<00:03:48.650> you

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
at frustrate it's game pressed in you

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.009 
at frustrate it's game pressed in you
can<00:03:49.340> see<00:03:49.489> how<00:03:49.609> did<00:03:49.790> it<00:03:50.269> changes<00:03:50.720> in<00:03:50.840> color

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
can see how did it changes in color

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:53.800 
can see how did it changes in color
slightly<00:03:51.319> though<00:03:52.250> like<00:03:52.430> this<00:03:52.639> that<00:03:53.510> is<00:03:53.659> not

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:53.810 
slightly though like this that is not

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
I should note fuck I'm not gonna use it

00:03:57.109 --> 00:03:58.899 
I should note fuck I'm not gonna use it
there<00:03:57.379> I'm<00:03:58.129> not<00:03:58.310> sure<00:03:58.370> mama

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
oh my god he's it so like this he killed

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.949 
oh my god he's it so like this he killed
I<00:04:01.459> mean<00:04:01.489> it's<00:04:02.209> not<00:04:02.359> gonna<00:04:02.479> do<00:04:02.720> that

00:04:02.949 --> 00:04:02.959 
I mean it's not gonna do that

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.270 
I mean it's not gonna do that
so<00:04:03.500> a<00:04:03.739> little<00:04:04.310> sperm<00:04:04.549> the<00:04:04.669> macro<00:04:05.409> and<00:04:06.409> watch

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
so a little sperm the macro and watch

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.129 
so a little sperm the macro and watch
plague<00:04:07.579> liege<00:04:07.760> it<00:04:07.970> will<00:04:08.239> not<00:04:08.419> it<00:04:08.690> will<00:04:08.780> not

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:09.139 
plague liege it will not it will not

00:04:09.139 --> 00:04:12.159 
plague liege it will not it will not
happen<00:04:09.609> see<00:04:10.609> how<00:04:10.790> it<00:04:10.909> just<00:04:11.030> like<00:04:11.209> it<00:04:11.900> just

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
happen see how it just like it just

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.020 
happen see how it just like it just
happened<00:04:12.199> without<00:04:12.709> it<00:04:13.669> being<00:04:13.849> like

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:14.030 
happened without it being like

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:15.369 
happened without it being like
highlighted<00:04:14.569> it's<00:04:14.690> because<00:04:14.930> the<00:04:15.049> map<00:04:15.199> the

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
highlighted it's because the map the

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.560 
highlighted it's because the map the
other<00:04:15.409> macro<00:04:15.859> is<00:04:16.039> casting<00:04:16.789> it<00:04:16.880> so<00:04:17.060> quickly<00:04:17.449> if

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
other macro is casting it so quickly if

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.569 
other macro is casting it so quickly if
barely<00:04:17.930> registers<00:04:18.380> actually<00:04:18.979> in<00:04:19.099> the<00:04:19.220> game

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
barely registers actually in the game

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.670 
barely registers actually in the game
I<00:04:19.609> realize<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:20.150> is<00:04:20.449> in<00:04:20.630> the<00:04:20.780> video<00:04:21.049> that<00:04:21.320> is

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
I realize that is in the video that is

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.800 
I realize that is in the video that is
just<00:04:21.979> basically<00:04:22.130> in<00:04:22.460> an<00:04:22.909> insight<00:04:23.300> hound<00:04:23.510> how<00:04:23.779> I

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
just basically in an insight hound how I

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:26.290 
just basically in an insight hound how I
use<00:04:24.770> certain<00:04:25.070> third<00:04:25.610> PI<00:04:25.760> software's<00:04:26.270> like

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
use certain third PI software's like

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.560 
use certain third PI software's like
that<00:04:26.690> light<00:04:26.930> rays<00:04:27.080> a<00:04:27.110> sign

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
that light rays a sign

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.510 
that light rays a sign
like<00:04:27.810> for<00:04:28.350> logitech<00:04:28.800> kind<00:04:28.980> of<00:04:29.070> stuff<00:04:29.280> and

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520 
like for logitech kind of stuff and

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.980 
like for logitech kind of stuff and
hopefully<00:04:30.210> I<00:04:30.240> can<00:04:30.330> give<00:04:30.570> you<00:04:30.630> a<00:04:30.690> bit<00:04:30.840> of<00:04:30.870> an

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
hopefully I can give you a bit of an

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.570 
hopefully I can give you a bit of an
inspiration<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.470> make<00:04:31.650> your<00:04:31.710> own<00:04:31.980> macros<00:04:32.190> and

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
inspiration to make your own macros and

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.550 
inspiration to make your own macros and
take<00:04:32.760> advantage<00:04:33.210> of<00:04:33.420> the<00:04:33.660> third<00:04:33.840> PI<00:04:34.020> software

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
take advantage of the third PI software

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.500 
take advantage of the third PI software
so<00:04:35.220> it<00:04:35.310> gives<00:04:35.460> you<00:04:35.550> an<00:04:35.670> actual<00:04:35.880> advantage<00:04:36.360> in

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
so it gives you an actual advantage in

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.310 
so it gives you an actual advantage in
game<00:04:36.660> if<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:37.050> want<00:04:37.200> another<00:04:37.410> example<00:04:38.040> and<00:04:39.320> I'm

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 
game if you want another example and I'm

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.750 
game if you want another example and I'm
gonna<00:04:40.470> cast<00:04:40.770> death<00:04:41.010> and<00:04:41.160> decay<00:04:41.250> now<00:04:41.520> you

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
gonna cast death and decay now you

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.310 
gonna cast death and decay now you
probably<00:04:42.060> won't<00:04:42.330> see<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.630> green<00:04:42.870> stuff<00:04:43.140> like

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
probably won't see the green stuff like

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.230 
probably won't see the green stuff like
the<00:04:43.440> green<00:04:43.680> planner<00:04:44.400> thing<00:04:44.700> because<00:04:45.030> I<00:04:45.120> have<00:04:45.210> a

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:45.240 
the green planner thing because I have a

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.760 
the green planner thing because I have a
macro<00:04:45.450> basically<00:04:46.020> does<00:04:46.200> it<00:04:46.290> automatically

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
macro basically does it automatically

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.940 
macro basically does it automatically
for<00:04:47.010> me<00:04:47.040> so<00:04:47.340> look<00:04:47.880> how<00:04:47.970> quick<00:04:48.180> this<00:04:48.300> happens

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:48.950 
for me so look how quick this happens

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.490 
for me so look how quick this happens
you<00:04:49.950> see<00:04:50.100> how<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.280> green<00:04:50.520> fin<00:04:50.760> didn't<00:04:51.000> appear

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
you see how the green fin didn't appear

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.870 
you see how the green fin didn't appear
and<00:04:52.500> that<00:04:52.560> is<00:04:52.740> basically<00:04:53.130> because<00:04:53.310> I<00:04:53.610> have<00:04:53.820> a

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
and that is basically because I have a

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.360 
and that is basically because I have a
macro<00:04:54.090> which<00:04:54.390> presses<00:04:55.320> the<00:04:55.650> key<00:04:55.830> bind<00:04:56.100> for

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
macro which presses the key bind for

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.940 
macro which presses the key bind for
death<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:56.700> decay<00:04:56.820> evident<00:04:57.420> clicks<00:04:57.740> very<00:04:58.740> very

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
death and decay evident clicks very very

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.980 
death and decay evident clicks very very
very<00:04:59.130> quickly<00:04:59.460> together<00:04:59.760> and<00:05:00.570> so<00:05:00.720> it<00:05:00.810> can<00:05:00.960> just

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
very quickly together and so it can just

that is another way tweaking used a

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.270 
that is another way tweaking used a

macro and you know but yeah you should
take<00:05:11.430> advantage<00:05:11.550> of<00:05:11.940> a<00:05:12.000> software<00:05:12.390> like<00:05:12.600> that

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
take advantage of a software like that

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.050 
take advantage of a software like that
you<00:05:13.050> know<00:05:13.170> and<00:05:13.440> you<00:05:14.010> know<00:05:14.100> hopefully<00:05:14.730> this
