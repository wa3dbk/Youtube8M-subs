00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.809
 Y 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.400
 and that you trade that costs you because I know very 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:14.600
 well the day of the widget well is this 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.219
 new video gentlemen in which you can 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.950
 teach how to get the achievement or trophy 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.300
 to give a corridor or take a walk or not 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.890
 be something like that the description 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.900
 of achievement says cycle three completes 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.580
 times then this achievement does not really 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:28.070
 it is difficult for that reason a bit tedious and 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.270
 so it can be said then that 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.820
 it's a cycle that you have to complete 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.470
 three times good a cycle is the fact of 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.149
 leave the island towards the golden bridge 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.890
 gate and returning to the golden gate bridge 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.320
 through the electric chairs towards 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.270
 the island this is a cycle that's a single 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.410
 cycle then to complete this achievement 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.180
 what you have to do is do this 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.680
 three kisses you already have to 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.110
 You practically have to use the chairs 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:49.160
 electrical three times then if not yes 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.330
 They do not know how to get to the golden bridge 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.150
 gate leave a link in the description 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.960
 so they can see how to get that achievement out of 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:55.370
 execute the escape plan that is 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.960
 build the plane and escape the island 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.100
 to get to this bridge but good 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.990
 So what do we have to do? 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.750
 as I said use the electric chairs 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.790
 three times then it's easy to simply 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.619
 he conceives on the plane they go to the bridge and 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.299
 And when you like, you come back to 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.229
 across a electric chairs 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.600
 thank you through the chairs 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.430
 electric are going to be on the map as 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.990
 they start going to be in the mode 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.150
 afterlife with his body thrown 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.100
 they simply relive themselves to have 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.660
 so how can you travel to the 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.510
 island again once I return is 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:25.670
 good when you return to the island of 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.590
 bridge and you pass a round you go zandt and 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.730
 like that new inventory and it tells you 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.530
 that instead of looking for parts of the 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:31.820
 plane you have to look for what they are 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.350
 these gas tanks tanks 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.790
 gasoline are practically in the same 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.470
 where all the parties were 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.180
 even some are in more places 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.920
 easy, you do not have to be opening 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.540
 doors or you have to be getting 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.790
 combinations or things and you're just going 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.530
 to that place and there will be a tank going to 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.000
 have gas tanks and just 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.460
 you have to grab the five that are in 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.690
 total in the miles parts that do the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.000
 tutorial that I leave in the description 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:55.300
 and simply to have it go from 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.560
 new to the roof there will be the plane 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.710
 fill it with gasoline and then 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.930
 you can return it to and you can go back to 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.570
 get on the plane then the same go 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.400
 again to the bridge they use the 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.590
 the electric chairs and again 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.660
 they come back spend another round they grab the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.520
 five gas tanks and the same thing 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:14.660
 full and you go and again when 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.880
 be there on the bridge and use the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.590
 electric chairs when you return to the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.930
 island and you're alive while in mode 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.260
 afterlife is going to give you the achievement of 30 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.120
 points at 30 hey points and I do not know how much 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.860
 worth in the precise then I think it 's 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.330
 of bronze or something like that but I do not know 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.560
 would be all the gentlemen of how I say 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.820
 it's a bit tedious but it's not so 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.860
 difficult to do simply need 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.120
 time and be somewhat organized them 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.340
 I recommend doing this better 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.560
 with friends as a team because it's a bit 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.730
 complex to do so only then then 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.190
 nothing gentlemen because that's all this 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.190
 video count a lot see you later 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.190
 goodbye
