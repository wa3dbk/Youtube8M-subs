 very emotional, very colorful people 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.520
 come here as citizens but the come comes to 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.800
 linked image nor the player 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.080
 she was very happy and said that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.970

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.880
 see who had a word with the 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.740
 her boyfriend should be more jokes 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.010
 To go with him, it was very cool. 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.619
 It was a very good experience, right? 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.490
 as I said we come as citizens 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.530
 as well as with ordinary people and the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.360
 player stays inside the field the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.549
 people come here and see the joy of these 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.340
 children brought some toys to 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.229
 they 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.540
 we got some time in our day spent 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.150
 a couple of hours I went out playing with 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.820
 they then do well to the heart I think 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.829
 which works well for anyone but for 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.310
 me has a different meaning from mine 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:47.850
 mother last year had breast cancer 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.009
 you see is a person in the house and 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.430
 Now you see children I have two 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.170
 daughters, too, I think it stirs a lot 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.439
 exciting and is for a good cause 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.750
 I think we came that legal is 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.140
 to make available a little of our 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.229
 time for such a noble cause 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:11.030
 I think it's super valid and this one with 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.030
 sure was the first visit of many
