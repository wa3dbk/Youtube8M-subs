there's<00:00:15.450> a<00:00:15.509> really<00:00:15.900> simple<00:00:16.230> solution<00:00:16.680> i

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
there's a really simple solution i

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.890 
there's a really simple solution i
stumbled<00:00:17.340> on<00:00:17.460> I'm<00:00:17.609> sure<00:00:17.760> someone<00:00:18.060> else<00:00:18.240> knew

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
stumbled on I'm sure someone else knew

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.720 
stumbled on I'm sure someone else knew
about<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.350> hundreds<00:00:19.800> of<00:00:19.859> years<00:00:20.010> ago<00:00:20.310> but<00:00:20.550> I

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
about this hundreds of years ago but I

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.450 
about this hundreds of years ago but I
just<00:00:21.000> discovered<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.539> thought<00:00:21.779> I'd<00:00:21.900> share<00:00:22.170> it

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
just discovered it thought I'd share it

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.630 
just discovered it thought I'd share it
so<00:00:23.460> there<00:00:24.090> are<00:00:24.210> three<00:00:24.510> eyes<00:00:24.810> to<00:00:25.800> every<00:00:26.099> coconut

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
so there are three eyes to every coconut

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.589 
so there are three eyes to every coconut
two<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.180> them<00:00:27.359> are<00:00:28.429> virtually<00:00:29.429> impossible<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
two of them are virtually impossible to

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.620 
two of them are virtually impossible to
open<00:00:31.140> but<00:00:31.500> there's<00:00:31.740> always<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.450> can

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
open but there's always one that you can

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.049 
open but there's always one that you can
pierce<00:00:33.930> really<00:00:34.410> easily<00:00:34.800> with<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> long<00:00:35.460> long

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
pierce really easily with a long long

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.319 
pierce really easily with a long long
thin<00:00:36.420> knife<00:00:36.660> and<00:00:37.730> considering<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.760> we<00:00:39.090> know

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
thin knife and considering that we know

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.319 
thin knife and considering that we know
that<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:40.320> meat<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.739> most<00:00:41.430> coconuts<00:00:42.059> unless

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
that the meat of most coconuts unless

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.200 
that the meat of most coconuts unless
you<00:00:42.510> catch<00:00:42.750> them<00:00:42.989> really<00:00:43.440> early<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.100> kind<00:00:45.090> of

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
you catch them really early is kind of

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.940 
you catch them really early is kind of
tough<00:00:45.420> and<00:00:45.690> rubbery<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:46.140> not<00:00:46.410> ideal<00:00:46.739> for

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
tough and rubbery and not ideal for

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.979 
tough and rubbery and not ideal for
digestion<00:00:47.460> what<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.090> part<00:00:48.329> that<00:00:48.510> most<00:00:48.629> people

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
digestion what the part that most people

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.330 
digestion what the part that most people
want<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.289> get<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:49.850> the<00:00:51.140> the<00:00:52.140> walk<00:00:52.860> coconut

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
want to get is the the walk coconut

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.979 
want to get is the the walk coconut
water<00:00:53.550> from<00:00:53.820> inside<00:00:54.180> because<00:00:54.449> it<00:00:54.570> tastes<00:00:54.780> good

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
water from inside because it tastes good

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.049 
water from inside because it tastes good
uh<00:00:55.460> so<00:00:57.559> this<00:00:58.559> is<00:00:58.739> what<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.890> did<00:00:59.010> took<00:00:59.640> this<00:00:59.789> knife

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
uh so this is what I did took this knife

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.020 
uh so this is what I did took this knife
shove<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.899> into<00:01:01.109> this<00:01:01.260> whole<00:01:01.910> turned<00:01:02.910> it

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
shove it into this whole turned it

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.219 
shove it into this whole turned it
around<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.359> couple<00:01:03.480> times<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.960> make<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
around a couple times to make the

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.010 
around a couple times to make the
opening<00:01:04.320> bigger<00:01:04.790> drained<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.240> water<00:01:06.420> out<00:01:06.750> I'm

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
opening bigger drained the water out I'm

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.620 
opening bigger drained the water out I'm
actually<00:01:07.439> impatient<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:09.180> figured<00:01:09.540> out

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
actually impatient and I figured out

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.750 
actually impatient and I figured out
that<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:09.900> could<00:01:10.110> just<00:01:10.439> suck<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.100> out<00:01:11.280> spit<00:01:11.700> it

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
that I could just suck it out spit it

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.429 
that I could just suck it out spit it
into<00:01:11.909> my<00:01:12.060> glass<00:01:12.210> because<00:01:12.960> that's<00:01:13.140> what<00:01:13.229> I'm

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
into my glass because that's what I'm

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.289 
into my glass because that's what I'm
hoping<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.580> with<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.790> i'll<00:01:14.880> show<00:01:15.030> you<00:01:15.090> right

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
hoping to do with it i'll show you right

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.920 
hoping to do with it i'll show you right
now<00:01:15.740> so

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.750 

here<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:22.980> the<00:01:24.170> water<00:01:25.170> of<00:01:25.550> one<00:01:26.550> and<00:01:26.700> a<00:01:26.730> half

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
here is the water of one and a half

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.580 
here is the water of one and a half
young<00:01:27.750> coconuts<00:01:28.620> and<00:01:29.750> so<00:01:30.750> just<00:01:31.140> sit<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.530> here

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
young coconuts and so just sit in here

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.210 
young coconuts and so just sit in here
and<00:01:32.330> I<00:01:33.330> like<00:01:33.840> drinking<00:01:34.230> it<00:01:34.290> but<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.770> realized

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
and I like drinking it but I realized

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.170 
and I like drinking it but I realized
that<00:01:35.310> there's<00:01:35.520> something<00:01:35.790> that<00:01:36.030> actually

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
that there's something that actually

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.550 
that there's something that actually
makes<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.870> taste<00:01:37.170> quite<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.800> bit<00:01:38.070> better<00:01:39.560> you

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
makes it taste quite a bit better you

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.530 
makes it taste quite a bit better you
know<00:01:40.770> that<00:01:41.010> dates<00:01:41.310> are<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.760> little<00:01:42.060> bit<00:01:42.240> hard<00:01:42.479> to

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
know that dates are a little bit hard to

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.510 
know that dates are a little bit hard to
digest<00:01:42.810> they've<00:01:43.440> been<00:01:43.590> dried<00:01:43.920> especially<00:01:44.460> if

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
digest they've been dried especially if

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.640 
digest they've been dried especially if
you<00:01:44.580> don't<00:01:44.760> get<00:01:44.880> them<00:01:45.000> fresh<00:01:45.410> when<00:01:46.410> you<00:01:46.500> get

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650 
you don't get them fresh when you get

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.930 
you don't get them fresh when you get
them<00:01:46.770> they've<00:01:47.100> been<00:01:47.250> sitting<00:01:47.400> around<00:01:47.550> for<00:01:47.820> a

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
them they've been sitting around for a

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.370 
them they've been sitting around for a
while<00:01:48.000> they're<00:01:48.240> kind<00:01:48.420> of<00:01:48.450> drive<00:01:48.750> hard<00:01:49.140> did<00:01:49.290> I

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
while they're kind of drive hard did I

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.890 
while they're kind of drive hard did I
just<00:01:49.650> so<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.790> probably<00:01:51.030> heard<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.600> you<00:01:51.720> can

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:51.900 
just so you probably heard that you can

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.240 
just so you probably heard that you can
just<00:01:51.990> soak<00:01:52.260> the<00:01:52.440> dates<00:01:52.619> water<00:01:53.010> and<00:01:53.190> they

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
just soak the dates water and they

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.310 
just soak the dates water and they
become<00:01:53.520> really<00:01:53.880> easily<00:01:54.300> digestible<00:01:54.930> or<00:01:55.200> at

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
become really easily digestible or at

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.889 
become really easily digestible or at
least<00:01:55.530> considerably<00:01:56.280> more<00:01:56.490> so<00:01:56.759> one<00:01:57.660> of<00:01:57.690> the

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
least considerably more so one of the

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.370 
least considerably more so one of the
things<00:01:57.960> I<00:01:58.290> like<00:01:58.470> to<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.830> is<00:01:59.330> soak<00:02:00.330> my<00:02:00.810> dates<00:02:01.110> in
