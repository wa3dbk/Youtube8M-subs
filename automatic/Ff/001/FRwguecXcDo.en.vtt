00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
take out as many cups as I can with

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.529 
take out as many cups as I can with
sticky<00:04:35.290> bombs<00:04:35.470> I<00:04:35.800> mean<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.789> mean<00:04:37.090> to<00:04:37.180> be<00:04:37.210> honest

sticky bombs I mean I mean to be honest

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:38.700 
sticky bombs I mean I mean to be honest
the<00:04:37.660> only<00:04:37.690> reason<00:04:37.840> that<00:04:38.050> we<00:04:38.199> really<00:04:38.380> do<00:04:38.530> that

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:38.710 
the only reason that we really do that

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:41.159 
the only reason that we really do that
is<00:04:38.979> because<00:04:39.759> I<00:04:39.970> can<00:04:40.270> only<00:04:40.389> take<00:04:40.660> out<00:04:40.840> the<00:04:40.960> cops

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
is because I can only take out the cops

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.050 
is because I can only take out the cops
like<00:04:41.410> they're<00:04:41.620> gonna<00:04:41.710> respond<00:04:42.130> anyway<00:04:42.460> but

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
like they're gonna respond anyway but

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:44.040 
like they're gonna respond anyway but
the<00:04:43.120> reason<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.389> we<00:04:43.539> actually<00:04:43.810> do<00:04:43.930> that

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
the reason that we actually do that

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.260 
the reason that we actually do that
sometime<00:04:44.380> so<00:04:44.710> you<00:04:45.520> don't<00:04:45.699> die<00:04:45.970> while<00:04:46.180> you're

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
sometime so you don't die while you're

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.640 
sometime so you don't die while you're
in<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.449> store<00:04:46.690> that's<00:04:46.990> why<00:04:47.139> I<00:04:47.169> did<00:04:47.440> to<00:04:47.620> protect
