00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.090
 against a bargain piece that is amazing 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.160

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.430
 micro sounds of luxury coming from 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.190

 I say that when king and the opinions of 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.320
 the people or another take a turn and read it 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.229
 and they will see as a microphone the 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.100
 host and that sounds fancy and I tell you 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:01.930
 It's like a fucking shit but it's good 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:03.640
 very functional so good very happy 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.550
 especially for audio quality at 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:10.190

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.460
 and let the world is studying the house 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.250
 through the window but he 's gone crazy 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:17.930
 man I sold the steering wheel the cce 27 and 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:21.350
 the truth has been to take the money 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.980
 on the one hand and invest it in the channel 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:26.630
 ok since I'm very happy about everything and 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.580
 good what the hell he does not risk 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.080
 he does not win and that in this life he does not risk 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.940
 when you are going to win is never like the 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.560
 time you want to run a race and 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.060
 that and he does not want to run away 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.270
 first you will have to lose many times 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.940
 and then 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.470
 look imagine yourself instead of with my mouth 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.750
 ok and with these Palestinians that I have 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.180
 imagine this microphone in the mouth of 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.460
 a good aunt with perfect teeth 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.070
 whites a precious tongue the molars 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.670
 all well placed and others imagine 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.670
 doing this 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.690
 well let's go I'm getting lost 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.690
 I lose myself not to mention when I 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.910

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.380

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.540
 they put something the videos I swear it is 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.519
 that I lose control and I do not even have to 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.150
 say or the body or anything else 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.150
 because really 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:27.129
 from time to time 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.720
 if we are human, 3 looks and you see 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:32.530

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.599

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.549

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:40.450
 difficult for the appearance that this 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.890
 it seems the microphone that the uncle bears 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:43.360

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.330
