did<00:02:16.489> for<00:02:16.670> our<00:02:16.790> game<00:02:17.000> we<00:02:17.720> certainly<00:02:18.110> fell<00:02:18.349> foul

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
did for our game we certainly fell foul

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.890 
did for our game we certainly fell foul
of<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:18.890> US<00:02:19.159> authorities<00:02:19.400> in<00:02:20.000> later<00:02:20.209> years<00:02:20.540> and

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
of the US authorities in later years and

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.750 
of the US authorities in later years and
I<00:02:20.959> believe<00:02:21.019> at<00:02:21.769> the<00:02:21.860> time<00:02:22.099> of<00:02:22.250> that<00:02:22.280> game<00:02:22.579> back

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
I believe at the time of that game back

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.750 
I believe at the time of that game back
in<00:02:22.939> 1972<00:02:23.810> in<00:02:24.110> Reykjavik<00:02:24.650> he<00:02:25.189> said<00:02:25.459> that<00:02:25.640> he

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
in 1972 in Reykjavik he said that he

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.789 
in 1972 in Reykjavik he said that he
felt<00:02:26.060> that<00:02:26.180> he<00:02:26.329> was<00:02:26.360> fitting<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.319> free<00:02:27.560> world

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
felt that he was fitting the free world

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:30.339 
felt that he was fitting the free world
against<00:02:28.099> the<00:02:28.189> lying<00:02:28.519> cheating<00:02:29.349> hypocritical

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
against the lying cheating hypocritical

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.509 
against the lying cheating hypocritical
Russians<00:02:30.890> how<00:02:31.129> did<00:02:31.340> Russia<00:02:31.519> view<00:02:31.819> him<00:02:32.799> in<00:02:33.799> 1972

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
Russians how did Russia view him in 1972

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.000 
Russians how did Russia view him in 1972
it<00:02:34.640> was<00:02:34.819> not<00:02:35.030> Russia<00:02:35.269> Soviet<00:02:35.599> Union<00:02:36.079> and<00:02:36.349> many

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
it was not Russia Soviet Union and many

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.710 
it was not Russia Soviet Union and many
in<00:02:37.250> the<00:02:37.400> Soviet<00:02:37.730> Union<00:02:37.760> recognized<00:02:38.450> that

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
in the Soviet Union recognized that

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.009 
in the Soviet Union recognized that
Fischer<00:02:39.189> was<00:02:40.189> taking<00:02:40.730> on<00:02:40.879> the<00:02:41.090> mighty<00:02:41.510> Soviet

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
Fischer was taking on the mighty Soviet

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:44.559 
Fischer was taking on the mighty Soviet
chess<00:02:42.230> school<00:02:42.590> and<00:02:42.799> in<00:02:43.609> fact<00:02:43.909> from

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:44.569 
chess school and in fact from

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:47.199 
chess school and in fact from
ideological<00:02:45.409> stance<00:02:46.099> it<00:02:46.370> was<00:02:46.579> a<00:02:46.609> fight<00:02:47.000> of

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
ideological stance it was a fight of

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.250 
ideological stance it was a fight of
individual<00:02:47.989> against<00:02:48.769> a<00:02:49.780> totalitarian<00:02:50.780> system

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
individual against a totalitarian system

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.580 
individual against a totalitarian system
and<00:02:52.129> I<00:02:52.849> think<00:02:53.269> that<00:02:53.420> he<00:02:53.540> he<00:02:53.599> had<00:02:54.109> a<00:02:54.139> lot<00:02:54.409> of

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
and I think that he he had a lot of

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.619 
and I think that he he had a lot of
supporters<00:02:55.400> even<00:02:55.760> in<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.329> Soviet<00:02:56.599> Union

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
supporters even in the Soviet Union

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.890 
supporters even in the Soviet Union
because<00:02:57.500> nobody<00:02:58.069> viewed<00:02:58.819> him<00:02:59.030> as<00:02:59.209> an<00:02:59.389> American

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
because nobody viewed him as an American

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.559 
because nobody viewed him as an American
fighting<00:03:00.139> Soviets<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:00.769> was<00:03:00.920> more<00:03:01.189> of<00:03:01.579> you<00:03:02.480> know

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:02.569 
fighting Soviets it was more of you know

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.879 
fighting Soviets it was more of you know
a<00:03:02.599> great<00:03:03.230> man<00:03:03.579> fighting<00:03:04.579> mighty<00:03:05.560> machine<00:03:06.560> and

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:06.889 
a great man fighting mighty machine and

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.530 
a great man fighting mighty machine and
he<00:03:07.870> he<00:03:08.870> missed<00:03:09.560> a<00:03:09.769> great<00:03:10.010> chance<00:03:10.400> of<00:03:10.639> promoting

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
he he missed a great chance of promoting

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.059 
he he missed a great chance of promoting
the<00:03:11.629> game<00:03:11.780> of<00:03:11.930> chess<00:03:12.109> because<00:03:12.590> he<00:03:12.859> was

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
the game of chess because he was

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.650 
the game of chess because he was
probably<00:03:13.310> one<00:03:13.579> of<00:03:13.639> the<00:03:13.909> most<00:03:14.150> popular

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
probably one of the most popular

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.250 
probably one of the most popular
Americans<00:03:15.169> in<00:03:15.530> mid<00:03:16.069> seventies<00:03:16.569> the<00:03:17.569> feeling

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
Americans in mid seventies the feeling

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.129 
Americans in mid seventies the feeling
certainly<00:03:19.099> at<00:03:19.220> that<00:03:19.250> time<00:03:19.699> was<00:03:20.030> that<00:03:20.060> this<00:03:20.870> was

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:21.139 
certainly at that time was that this was

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.650 
certainly at that time was that this was
the<00:03:21.169> cold<00:03:21.530> war<00:03:21.919> being<00:03:22.310> fought<00:03:22.760> on<00:03:23.090> the

him to Rainey also heard from Henry

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.960 
him to Rainey also heard from Henry
Kissinger<00:03:30.500> as<00:03:30.769> well<00:03:31.010> do<00:03:31.430> you<00:03:31.519> think<00:03:31.730> that<00:03:31.849> that

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
Kissinger as well do you think that that

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.879 
Kissinger as well do you think that that
was<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.180> similar<00:03:32.690> view<00:03:32.870> as<00:03:33.139> far<00:03:33.349> as<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.530> Soviet

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:33.889 
was a similar view as far as the Soviet

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.930 
was a similar view as far as the Soviet

Union was concerned Biswas key no I

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.780 
Union was concerned Biswas key no I
think<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.930> was<00:03:39.409> it<00:03:39.650> was<00:03:39.859> not<00:03:40.040> yet<00:03:40.190> recognized

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
think it was it was not yet recognized

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.089 
think it was it was not yet recognized
as<00:03:41.150> a<00:03:41.209> matter<00:03:41.690> of<00:03:41.870> such<00:03:42.139> importance<00:03:42.859> because

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
as a matter of such importance because

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.420 
as a matter of such importance because
solid<00:03:44.000> dominance<00:03:44.449> was<00:03:44.629> so<00:03:44.870> long<00:03:45.319> and<00:03:45.799> only

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
solid dominance was so long and only

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.280 
solid dominance was so long and only

the public moved do you think those sort

of<00:04:50.479> mind<00:04:51.349> games<00:04:51.740> affected<00:04:52.580> Spassky<00:04:53.240> and<00:04:53.539> saw

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
of mind games affected Spassky and saw

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:57.339 
of mind games affected Spassky and saw
Fischer<00:04:54.590> just<00:04:54.979> basically<00:04:55.969> beats<00:04:56.960> him<00:04:57.169> outta

00:04:57.339 --> 00:04:57.349 
Fischer just basically beats him outta

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:01.330 
Fischer just basically beats him outta
sight<00:04:57.620> I<00:04:58.009> think<00:04:58.939> that<00:04:59.150> Fischer<00:04:59.629> are<00:05:00.469> some<00:05:01.219> of

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
sight I think that Fischer are some of

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.709 
sight I think that Fischer are some of
the<00:05:01.460> Fischer's<00:05:01.819> moves<00:05:02.150> out<00:05:02.360> of<00:05:02.419> the

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:02.719 
the Fischer's moves out of the

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:04.689 
the Fischer's moves out of the
chessboard<00:05:03.050> were<00:05:03.500> not<00:05:03.710> just<00:05:03.919> eccentric<00:05:04.310> but

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:04.699 
chessboard were not just eccentric but

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.179 
chessboard were not just eccentric but
they<00:05:04.939> had<00:05:05.090> a<00:05:05.120> psychological<00:05:06.189> background

00:05:07.179 --> 00:05:07.189 
they had a psychological background

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:09.339 
they had a psychological background
because<00:05:08.060> he<00:05:08.389> knew<00:05:08.569> that

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:09.349 
because he knew that

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:13.029 
because he knew that
staska<00:05:10.069> was<00:05:10.460> very<00:05:10.729> sensitive<00:05:11.419> to<00:05:11.750> this<00:05:12.710> kind

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:13.039 
staska was very sensitive to this kind

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:15.820 
staska was very sensitive to this kind
of<00:05:13.129> pressure<00:05:13.460> and<00:05:13.879> some<00:05:14.689> belief<00:05:15.020> and<00:05:15.469> again<00:05:15.800> I

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
of pressure and some belief and again I

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.070 
of pressure and some belief and again I
could<00:05:16.159> rely<00:05:16.490> on<00:05:16.520> the<00:05:17.029> impressions<00:05:17.689> of<00:05:17.839> those

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:18.080 
could rely on the impressions of those

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:20.950 
could rely on the impressions of those
witness<00:05:18.650> the<00:05:18.770> match<00:05:18.979> that<00:05:19.779> Spassky<00:05:20.779> was

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
witness the match that Spassky was

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.950 
witness the match that Spassky was
definitely<00:05:21.819> shaken<00:05:22.960> psychologically

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
definitely shaken psychologically

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.629 
definitely shaken psychologically
especially<00:05:24.620> at<00:05:24.680> the<00:05:24.860> game<00:05:25.039> too<00:05:25.250> and<00:05:25.460> Fischer

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:25.639 
especially at the game too and Fischer

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:27.550 
especially at the game too and Fischer
didn't<00:05:25.969> show<00:05:26.089> up<00:05:26.210> and<00:05:26.419> Spassky<00:05:26.839> got<00:05:27.020> one<00:05:27.229> point

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
didn't show up and Spassky got one point

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.369 
didn't show up and Spassky got one point
for<00:05:27.889> doing<00:05:28.099> absolutely<00:05:28.400> nothing<00:05:28.759> and<00:05:29.379> their

for doing absolutely nothing and their

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:32.110 
for doing absolutely nothing and their
recommendation<00:05:31.039> this<00:05:31.099> basket<00:05:31.520> was<00:05:31.669> not<00:05:31.969> to

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
recommendation this basket was not to

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
the psychological balance no doubt that

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.820 
the psychological balance no doubt that
Spassky<00:05:39.620> was<00:05:40.039> not<00:05:40.250> ready<00:05:40.520> for<00:05:40.789> this<00:05:40.909> kind<00:05:41.569> of

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
Spassky was not ready for this kind of

Spassky was not ready for this kind of
psychological<00:05:42.830> warfare<00:05:43.250> but<00:05:43.759> at<00:05:43.879> the<00:05:44.029> end<00:05:44.149> of

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:44.270 
psychological warfare but at the end of

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:46.450 
psychological warfare but at the end of
the<00:05:44.360> day<00:05:44.539> Fischer<00:05:45.050> simple<00:05:45.560> played<00:05:45.860> great

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
the day Fischer simple played great

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.860 
the day Fischer simple played great
chess<00:05:46.759> it<00:05:47.029> was<00:05:47.210> a<00:05:47.240> better<00:05:47.539> player<00:05:47.839> than

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
chess it was a better player than

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.459 
chess it was a better player than
Spassky<00:05:48.439> 1972<00:05:49.219> biggest<00:05:50.060> ascii<00:05:50.509> was<00:05:50.750> at<00:05:51.259> the

00:05:51.459 --> 00:05:51.469 
Spassky 1972 biggest ascii was at the

00:05:51.469 --> 00:05:55.499 
Spassky 1972 biggest ascii was at the
height<00:05:51.680> of<00:05:51.919> his<00:05:52.909> chest<00:05:53.539> era<00:05:53.870> and<00:05:54.169> that<00:05:54.199> yet<00:05:55.099> did

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:55.509 
height of his chest era and that yet did

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:58.929 
height of his chest era and that yet did
1972<00:05:56.509> this<00:05:56.719> era<00:05:57.169> ended<00:05:57.560> and<00:05:57.710> Fischer<00:05:57.919> was<00:05:58.669> at

00:05:58.929 --> 00:05:58.939 
1972 this era ended and Fischer was at

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:00.909 
1972 this era ended and Fischer was at
the<00:05:59.060> beginning<00:05:59.539> of<00:05:59.779> a<00:06:00.080> new<00:06:00.259> professional

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
the beginning of a new professional

00:06:00.919 --> 00:06:03.749 
the beginning of a new professional
chess<00:06:01.129> so<00:06:01.370> he<00:06:01.520> was<00:06:01.669> a<00:06:01.699> pioneer<00:06:02.029> and<00:06:02.569> he<00:06:02.960> simply

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:03.759 
chess so he was a pioneer and he simply

00:06:03.759 --> 00:06:06.159 
chess so he was a pioneer and he simply
superseded<00:06:04.759> Spassky<00:06:05.210> as<00:06:05.360> a<00:06:05.389> professional<00:06:05.960> and

00:06:06.159 --> 00:06:06.169 
superseded Spassky as a professional and

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:08.700 
superseded Spassky as a professional and
a<00:06:06.469> final<00:06:06.740> thought<00:06:07.129> well<00:06:07.849> would<00:06:08.000> chest<00:06:08.300> be<00:06:08.479> now

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:08.710 
a final thought well would chest be now

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.339 
a final thought well would chest be now
if<00:06:09.710> it<00:06:09.860> hadn't<00:06:10.159> been<00:06:10.250> for<00:06:10.460> Bobby<00:06:10.639> Fischer<00:06:11.349> it

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:12.349 
if it hadn't been for Bobby Fischer it

00:06:12.349 --> 00:06:14.469 
if it hadn't been for Bobby Fischer it
was<00:06:12.589> a<00:06:12.620> very<00:06:13.039> very<00:06:13.339> different<00:06:13.639> game<00:06:14.060> I<00:06:14.330> think

00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 
was a very very different game I think

00:06:14.479 --> 00:06:16.570 
was a very very different game I think
that<00:06:14.750> Fischer<00:06:15.469> could<00:06:15.860> be<00:06:15.979> simply<00:06:16.310> called<00:06:16.490> the

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
that Fischer could be simply called the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.610 
that Fischer could be simply called the
founder<00:06:16.939> of<00:06:17.029> professional<00:06:17.599> chess<00:06:17.810> and<00:06:18.050> his
