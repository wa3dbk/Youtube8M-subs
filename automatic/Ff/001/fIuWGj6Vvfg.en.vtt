00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.630
 a big advantage for the Swiss that actually makes me a little more 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:12.929
 so there especially on his counter 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.409
 lukaku who are actually small fish 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:18.859
 the entrance is free the costs are much lower and against 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.339
 suffers we see very well here 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:22.810
 on the part 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.070
 the truce tonight very big fish that are just there way of nights this 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.009
 which is constant I always look forward to canceling them 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.889
 four kilometers an hour or so with a deal it actually means that the 

00:00:31.889 --> 00:00:35.000
 small fish will inevitably beam a best of - others appear 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.910
 much smaller 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.960
 while the big fish and does not automatically when we go over 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.540
 much remains the beam so we can distinguish the echoes 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.480
 others am I rather fish fodder or on the contrary that a 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.090
 messi who are at the foot of the site 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.220
 there what I have for example here we see very steep very compact bull of 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.690
 Fodder fish understand fun season to zoom ham on 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.950
 the vigilantes 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.520
 in short a very compact ball of forage fish 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.640
 big parties in sight katie who will iron even wheelbase for him 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.850
 the dike to mention time and we understand it is found 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.380
 what to think also you can still not finished a little trick in 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.010
 particular images in relation to this menu a little whole group 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.980
 it is necessary under my eyes I want to go down regulate but in fact it is a contrast 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.960
 so here I'm going on purpose I lowered my stable contract 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.590
 we see very clearly 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.590
 all echoes conquered its dwindling 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.200
 he adds that his text does not think 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.920
 was I going to 30% 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.790
 so there we are actually navigating in the day in the old 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.970
 being much more people make it prevail one sees when for 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.420
 things a little bit blocked 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.049
 in this context the screen but in fact if immediately I go back to it 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.700
 contrast is always my post 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.410
 you will see everywhere 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.060
 we simply find 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.940
 bumbling fish here and there on the contrary this low contrast a little bit like 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:54.280
 sensitize 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.220
 and it will allow you to start with the best perception 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.150
 possible from your screen 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.330
 just asked to perform the truth there I will close 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.830
 on the menu to go back to full screen 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.789
 he must same thing he would be well found 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.769
 fish that are positive 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.619
 what lies at the foot of the old line 

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.119
 a school of white fish that is just above 

00:02:16.119 --> 00:02:19.119
 here the fish very clearly take off and which are bigger 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:21.719
 he has what we see there 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:24.589
 just after that it's strains we see very clearly that it's 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:25.389
 drop 

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:26.459
 from the city 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.849
 so if the old zaroff expectations 

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.919
 just the oily fish making it five dead side cut into four walls 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:36.019
 a bit like a big shot 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.429
 there you have the old time again 

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:41.789
 we find some pots are often in the background and we find of course 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:45.569
 but after white fish that are very present note also said 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.299
 at this time of the year 

00:02:49.299 --> 00:02:50.249
