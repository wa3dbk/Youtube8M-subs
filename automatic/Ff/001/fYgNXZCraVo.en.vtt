you completely solo I think it's a
really<00:02:54.300> good<00:02:54.420> gameplay<00:02:54.840> he<00:02:55.050> plays<00:02:55.230> a<00:02:55.260> little

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
really good gameplay he plays a little

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.710 
really good gameplay he plays a little
defensive<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.520> what<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:56.790> you<00:02:56.910> say<00:02:57.090> it's<00:02:57.480> free

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
defensive but what can you say it's free

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.050 
defensive but what can you say it's free
