00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.629
 within the framework of the Ministry of Innovation thinks the future were students 

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.959
 Student of the tenth grade of Gymnasium Walldorf 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.070
 a week at the MLP AG Wiesloch 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.970
 in the five days to the four teams a concept for a virtual black 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:25.349
 Brett on the intranet of MLP 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:29.699
 on April 16, the 32 high school students get their results a selected one 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.920
 Present audience 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.920
 otherwise this is why cooperation between business and school is needed 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.499
 a little more to promote while men already a lot 

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:41.869
 at the seat in the form of dividends and grouped the students more a week 

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:43.860
 spent but met him 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.210
 and have tried to in this one week secures the company 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.130
 to set up and implement the project the new bulletin board and I am 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.190
 excited what came out of it 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.400
 So instead of positively surprised 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.739
 After all, my husband always thinks of this 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.330
 around age group it is difficult then to agree on some in the short time 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.580
 and with 32 students it is not a matter of course and yes I have to 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.630
 say they did that very well and he had me at the end of the week as well 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.080
 no more concerns that it will come out a good result 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.460
 So I have to say that the students worked very concentrated in 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.190
 Small groups without supervision in between which worked very well 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.580
 and that they worked very disciplined 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.950
 It is important for us to also MLP around 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.380
 to introduce and show the students what you learn here 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.660
 can that also has the company's own this week 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:40.540
 and we are pleased, of course, if I again here then synonymous Sachs GS 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.850
 which are also important not only the notes to expand then 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.030
 can and have received feedback from us then he has theirs 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.470
 Website the bulletin board 8 and for RWE the Insight 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.630
 as a team at individual class 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.780
 right then the Saarland he had no problem with just SATA and 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.320
 known in a lawsuit 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.830
 I think by all means have become seven victims with now be with 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.190
 presentations 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.350
 and we can do it okay too 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.630
 processing better information and teamwork are currently complaints 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.639
 grown 

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.190
 So yes, we had to do a project work at the beginning 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.430
 around with solved groups and around 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:22.129
 Even at the beginning, more groups might not even become people afterward 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:22.859
 we then 

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:27.049
 to be solved even if we have understood each other well in the class what you 

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.769
 at first even weirder with did not know which one should work now so 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.179
 But in the end it all worked quite well 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:36.269
 So you have become much safer that's why I want to if we again 

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.529
 Clearly, with all these lectures now, they're going to school 

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:44.269
 For example, you just have to do a lecture once a month 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.849
 and now all the time I have to learn to speak in front of the class and 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:50.649
 Of course, it is also correct not to be crossed with your back 

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:54.909
 but Real are just working on that and of course that has brought something 

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:56.159
 said later 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:59.099
 In any case, because it's actually much more than just school 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.059
 because something practical is not just theory
