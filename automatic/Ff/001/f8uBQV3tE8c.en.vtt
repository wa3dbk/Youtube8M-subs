00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:18.199
 hello you want the aircraft carrier 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.199
 drives 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.260
 Well, we have discussed the 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:31.949
 Remove the remote control and the motors 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:49.789
 everything we need and can show 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:49.789
 sometimes crazy part works 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:21.970
 and so quickly should the aircraft carrier 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:28.030
 and 30 cm high and 30 cm wide ship 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:29.920
 made of wood and plastic but has that 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.850
 ship also no wheels but 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.070
 propeller 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:46.119
 So exactly 22 engines so no helm 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:49.270
 but just then both after 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.479
 preprinted and murder forward if one 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:55.630
 both retreat backwards and one 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.819
 one presses then drives into drive 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.299
 still there when a neighbor pushes 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:03.420
 still there when you look back then it turns 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:08.200
 on the spot 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.989
 very articulated aircraft carrier ok so 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.810
 then it will take time 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:19.019
 careful that you can not help again 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.019
 together so okay so go out
