00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
bathroom this is with the flash bouncing

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.999 
bathroom this is with the flash bouncing
up<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.049> ceiling<00:01:19.549> versus<00:01:20.549> check<00:01:20.939> out<00:01:22.009> with

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
up to the ceiling versus check out with

up to the ceiling versus check out with
my<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.580> know<00:01:23.850> regular<00:01:24.060> flash<00:01:24.570> on<00:01:24.810> my<00:01:24.930> Canon<00:01:25.200> 7d

my you know regular flash on my Canon 7d

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.819 
my you know regular flash on my Canon 7d

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
so it makes a lot of difference and

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.609 
so it makes a lot of difference and

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
there's other examples like this this

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.600 
there's other examples like this this
chair<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.250> know<00:01:33.290> without<00:01:34.290> flash<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.100> with

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
the bouncing flash and also this truck

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.510 
the bouncing flash and also this truck
you<00:01:40.490> know<00:01:41.490> without<00:01:41.880> flash<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.270> with<00:01:43.520> light

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
bouncing off the ceiling anyway this is

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.399 
bouncing off the ceiling anyway this is
going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> work<00:01:47.729> really<00:01:48.060> well<00:01:48.210> for<00:01:48.689> those

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
going to work really well for those

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.510 
going to work really well for those
