it done all right first question how

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.609 
it done all right first question how
exactly<00:00:18.119> does<00:00:18.330> high<00:00:18.600> carbohydrate<00:00:19.320> intake

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
exactly does high carbohydrate intake

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.620 
exactly does high carbohydrate intake

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
cause water retention I can't seem to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.900 
cause water retention I can't seem to
find<00:00:21.900> any<00:00:22.529> consensus<00:00:23.220> online<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:23.789> most

find any consensus online and most
people<00:00:24.240> are<00:00:24.390> stupid<00:00:25.550> if<00:00:26.550> you<00:00:27.029> mean

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
people are stupid if you mean

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.480 
people are stupid if you mean
subcutaneous<00:00:28.260> water<00:00:28.529> retention<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.429> the

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
subcutaneous water retention and the

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.339 
subcutaneous water retention and the
carb<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.000> spilling<00:00:30.240> over<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.720> it<00:00:30.900> if<00:00:31.019> you're

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
carb is spilling over to it if you're

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.569 
carb is spilling over to it if you're
drugged<00:00:31.650> for<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.859> don't<00:00:31.949> worry<00:00:32.130> about<00:00:32.279> that

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
drugged for you don't worry about that

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.290 
drugged for you don't worry about that
that<00:00:33.540> is<00:00:33.870> purely<00:00:34.559> from<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.550> steroid<00:00:36.000> world

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that is purely from the steroid world

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.260 
that is purely from the steroid world
now<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.710> will<00:00:37.860> drop<00:00:38.160> subcutaneous<00:00:39.059> water

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
now you will drop subcutaneous water

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.860 
now you will drop subcutaneous water
purely<00:00:40.230> from<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.500> calorie<00:00:40.829> deficit<00:00:41.629> so<00:00:42.629> just

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
purely from a calorie deficit so just

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.510 
purely from a calorie deficit so just
keeping<00:00:43.200> your<00:00:43.379> calories<00:00:43.950> within<00:00:44.190> check<00:00:44.370> or

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
keeping your calories within check or

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.130 
keeping your calories within check or
prevent<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.940> and<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.120> very<00:00:45.420> large<00:00:45.629> calorie

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
prevent that and a very large calorie

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.069 
prevent that and a very large calorie
surplus<00:00:46.410> can<00:00:47.250> cause<00:00:47.610> some<00:00:48.360> general<00:00:48.870> water

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
surplus can cause some general water

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.930 
surplus can cause some general water
retention<00:00:49.460> irrespective<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.550> what<00:00:50.789> you're

gear<00:01:13.799> that's<00:01:14.040> what's<00:01:14.220> causing<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
gear that's what's causing that and the

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.200 
gear that's what's causing that and the
cards<00:01:16.350> do<00:01:16.530> play<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> big<00:01:16.979> role<00:01:17.220> there<00:01:17.460> but

cards do play a big role there but

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.850 
cards do play a big role there but
outside<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.320> if<00:01:19.590> you're<00:01:19.680> talking<00:01:19.770> about

outside of that if you're talking about

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
the other water retention from it it has

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.600 
the other water retention from it it has
to<00:01:21.750> do<00:01:21.900> with<00:01:21.930> muscle<00:01:22.680> glycogen<00:01:22.920> because

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
to do with muscle glycogen because

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.429 
to do with muscle glycogen because
obviously<00:01:23.869> glycogen<00:01:24.869> has<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.200> start

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
obviously glycogen has to start

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:26.510 
obviously glycogen has to start
somewhere<00:01:25.680> unless<00:01:25.920> your<00:01:26.189> muscle<00:01:26.430> glycogen

a--let's<00:01:27.000> carbs<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.540> get<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.720> little<00:01:27.990> bit

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
a--let's carbs you can get a little bit

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.380 
a--let's carbs you can get a little bit
from<00:01:28.409> protein<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.009> little<00:01:29.820> less<00:01:30.000> from<00:01:30.210> fat

and<00:01:30.420> yes<00:01:31.040> people<00:01:32.040> don't<00:01:32.970> know<00:01:33.119> biochemistry

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
and yes people don't know biochemistry

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.539 
and yes people don't know biochemistry
you<00:01:34.079> think<00:01:34.350> that<00:01:34.560> doesn't<00:01:34.860> convert<00:01:35.310> into

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
you think that doesn't convert into

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.789 
you think that doesn't convert into
glucose<00:01:35.939> at<00:01:36.119> all<00:01:36.299> well<00:01:36.630> actually<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:37.320> can<00:01:37.560> I'm

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
glucose at all well actually it can I'm

glucose<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.180> your<00:01:51.270> body<00:01:51.570> so<00:01:52.640> take<00:01:53.640> that

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
glucose in your body so take that

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.340 
glucose in your body so take that
straight<00:01:54.119> keto<00:01:54.479> diet<00:01:54.720> as<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.020> say<00:01:55.170> they're

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
straight keto diet as you say they're

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.310 
straight keto diet as you say they're
not<00:01:55.380> getting<00:01:55.619> glucose<00:01:56.100> from<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:57.479> that

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
not getting glucose from that now that

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.780 
not getting glucose from that now that
glucose<00:01:58.799> goes<00:01:59.040> into<00:01:59.250> your<00:01:59.369> muscle<00:01:59.670> tissue

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
glucose goes into your muscle tissue

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.030 
glucose goes into your muscle tissue
every<00:02:00.570> gram<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.990> glucose<00:02:01.469> attracts

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
every gram of glucose attracts

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.609 
every gram of glucose attracts
approximately<00:02:02.570> one<00:02:03.570> gram<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.899> water<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.560> if

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
approximately one gram of water so if

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.590 
approximately one gram of water so if
you've<00:02:04.799> stored<00:02:05.189> an<00:02:05.399> extra<00:02:05.729> 50<00:02:06.119> grams<00:02:06.390> of

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
you've stored an extra 50 grams of

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.570 
you've stored an extra 50 grams of
glucose<00:02:06.960> in<00:02:07.140> your<00:02:07.259> muscle<00:02:07.590> cells<00:02:07.740> you're

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
glucose in your muscle cells you're

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.550 
glucose in your muscle cells you're
going<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.789> pull<00:02:08.910> in<00:02:09.030> another<00:02:09.270> 200<00:02:09.929> grams<00:02:10.229> of

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
going to pull in another 200 grams of

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.100 
going to pull in another 200 grams of
water<00:02:10.830> this<00:02:11.039> 250<00:02:11.730> grams<00:02:11.970> of<00:02:12.120> water

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
water this 250 grams of water

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.220 
water this 250 grams of water
that<00:02:13.350> is<00:02:13.620> half<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.160> pound<00:02:15.080> approximately<00:02:16.080> my

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
that is half a pound approximately my

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.480 
that is half a pound approximately my
math<00:02:16.410> could<00:02:16.590> be<00:02:16.710> off<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:17.010> my<00:02:17.100> head

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
math could be off in my head

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.110 
math could be off in my head
so<00:02:18.980> yeah<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.220> carbs<00:02:20.520> will<00:02:20.640> make<00:02:20.790> you<00:02:20.940> hold

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
so yeah the carbs will make you hold

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.810 
so yeah the carbs will make you hold
intramuscular<00:02:21.960> water<00:02:22.490> through<00:02:23.490> cellular

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
intramuscular water through cellular

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.820 
intramuscular water through cellular
volume<00:02:24.360> because<00:02:24.690> the<00:02:24.840> glycogen<00:02:25.350> itself

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
volume because the glycogen itself

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.040 
volume because the glycogen itself
actually<00:02:26.100> attracts<00:02:26.910> water<00:02:27.180> molecules<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.930> it

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
actually attracts water molecules to it

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.190 
actually attracts water molecules to it
it<00:02:28.170> has<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:29.150> so<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.540> is<00:02:30.660> what<00:02:30.810> causes<00:02:31.020> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
it has to so that is what causes the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.910 
it has to so that is what causes the
water<00:02:31.380> retention<00:02:31.650> from<00:02:32.070> the<00:02:32.220> high<00:02:32.340> carbs

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
water retention from the high carbs

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.170 
water retention from the high carbs

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
arbitrary number no that isn't backed by

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.840 
arbitrary number no that isn't backed by
science<00:03:43.650> at<00:03:43.739> every<00:03:44.070> single<00:03:44.250> person<00:03:44.489> needs

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
science at every single person needs

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.240 
science at every single person needs
exactly<00:03:45.360> eight<00:03:45.810> hours<00:03:46.170> because<00:03:46.380> some<00:03:46.830> can<00:03:47.100> be

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
exactly eight hours because some can be

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.310 
exactly eight hours because some can be
very<00:03:47.519> very<00:03:48.000> well<00:03:48.209> on<00:03:48.239> six<00:03:48.720> and<00:03:48.900> some<00:03:49.110> might

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
very very well on six and some might

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.789 
very very well on six and some might
need<00:03:49.620> ten<00:03:49.950> but<00:03:50.700> eight<00:03:50.910> is<00:03:51.060> a<00:03:51.090> good<00:03:51.390> solid<00:03:51.799> round

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
need ten but eight is a good solid round

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.490 
need ten but eight is a good solid round
number<00:03:53.340> in<00:03:53.519> between<00:03:53.670> the<00:03:54.030> range<00:03:54.269> so<00:03:55.049> I<00:03:55.080> would

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
number in between the range so I would

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.660 
number in between the range so I would
say<00:03:55.650> that<00:03:55.830> should<00:03:55.950> be<00:03:56.010> your<00:03:56.220> baseline<00:03:56.640> that

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
say that should be your baseline that

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.330 
say that should be your baseline that
you<00:03:56.910> should<00:03:57.120> shoot<00:03:57.360> for<00:03:57.720> and<00:03:58.190> adjust<00:03:59.190> from

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
you should shoot for and adjust from

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.440 
you should shoot for and adjust from
there

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.930 

the<00:04:03.450> cats<00:04:03.690> are<00:04:04.019> dragging<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.739> tripod<00:04:05.220> oh<00:04:05.549> well

the cats are dragging a tripod oh well

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.100 
the cats are dragging a tripod oh well
alright<00:04:06.540> okay<00:04:07.350> next<00:04:07.709> question<00:04:08.720> why<00:04:09.720> are<00:04:09.780> some

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
alright okay next question why are some

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.660 
alright okay next question why are some
people<00:04:10.380> a<00:04:10.440> lot<00:04:10.620> more<00:04:10.650> vascular<00:04:11.220> than<00:04:11.400> others

but I think in the later near the end he

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:51.980
