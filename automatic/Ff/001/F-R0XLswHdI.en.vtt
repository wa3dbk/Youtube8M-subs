00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.730 
in action
now<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.150> NSX<00:00:12.690> isn't<00:00:13.080> particularly<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.530> car

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
now the NSX isn't particularly a car

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.560 
now the NSX isn't particularly a car
you'd<00:00:13.950> really<00:00:14.759> show<00:00:15.150> with<00:00:15.269> drifting

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
you'd really show with drifting

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.849 
you'd really show with drifting
you'd<00:00:15.690> think<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.109> car<00:00:16.289> with<00:00:16.470> the<00:00:16.560> engine<00:00:16.800> at

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
you'd think of a car with the engine at

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.109 
you'd think of a car with the engine at
the<00:00:16.920> front<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.340> obviously<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.670> power<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.029> the

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
the front and obviously the power to the

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.090 
the front and obviously the power to the
rear<00:00:18.300> but<00:00:18.480> this<00:00:18.600> is<00:00:18.720> mid-engined<00:00:18.930> quite<00:00:19.859> heavy

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
rear but this is mid-engined quite heavy

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.759 
rear but this is mid-engined quite heavy
difficult<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.029> drift<00:00:21.300> yeah<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.720> think<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.619> one

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
difficult to drift yeah I think the one

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.189 
difficult to drift yeah I think the one
of<00:00:22.890> the<00:00:22.949> most<00:00:23.160> difficult<00:00:23.580> one<00:00:23.699> okay<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.420> you're

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
of the most difficult one okay so you're

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:26.689 
of the most difficult one okay so you're
drifting<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.769> most<00:00:25.920> difficult<00:00:26.099> car<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
drifting a most difficult car with the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.189 
drifting a most difficult car with the
most<00:00:26.820> difficult<00:00:27.240> technique<00:00:27.599> just<00:00:27.930> so<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.109> can

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
most difficult technique just so you can

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.250 
most difficult technique just so you can
basically<00:00:28.349> show<00:00:28.680> off<00:00:28.830> here<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.810> agree<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.080> that

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
basically show off here I agree on that

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.810

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
little bit of handbrake some corner you

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.250 
little bit of handbrake some corner you
may<00:02:54.489> use<00:02:54.730> a<00:02:54.970> lot<00:02:55.150> of<00:02:55.209> handbrake<00:02:55.540> but<00:02:56.019> make<00:02:56.230> sure

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
may use a lot of handbrake but make sure

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.839 
may use a lot of handbrake but make sure
before<00:02:56.620> you<00:02:56.830> pull<00:02:57.010> handbrake<00:02:57.310> make<00:02:57.549> sure<00:02:57.700> you

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
before you pull handbrake make sure you

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:00.449 
before you pull handbrake make sure you
dip<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.209> clutch<00:02:58.420> of<00:02:59.080> course<00:02:59.440> so<00:03:00.040> it's<00:03:00.190> not<00:03:00.340> as

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
dip the clutch of course so it's not as

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:01.800 
dip the clutch of course so it's not as
simple<00:03:00.640> as<00:03:00.819> just<00:03:00.910> grabbing<00:03:01.360> the<00:03:01.450> handbrake

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
simple as just grabbing the handbrake

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.059 
simple as just grabbing the handbrake
and<00:03:01.959> seeing<00:03:02.140> what<00:03:02.290> happens<00:03:02.590> there's<00:03:02.769> an

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
and seeing what happens there's an

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.610 
and seeing what happens there's an
artery<00:03:03.489> you<00:03:03.610> can<00:03:03.730> damage<00:03:04.330> a<00:03:04.390> lot<00:03:04.599> of<00:03:04.660> thing<00:03:04.870> you

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
artery you can damage a lot of thing you

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.410 
artery you can damage a lot of thing you
can<00:03:05.739> brake<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.040> car<00:03:06.069> of<00:03:06.370> course<00:03:06.430> well<00:03:07.269> I<00:03:07.299> think

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
can brake the car of course well I think

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.030 
can brake the car of course well I think
we<00:03:07.540> better<00:03:07.690> get<00:03:07.840> in<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:07.959> car<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.349> see<00:03:08.799> how<00:03:08.890> it's

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
we better get in a car and see how it's

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.030 
we better get in a car and see how it's
done<00:03:09.130> boys<00:03:09.370> ok<00:03:13.560> riding<00:03:14.560> boys

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
done boys ok riding boys

handbrake<00:03:15.340> turns<00:03:15.700> very<00:03:16.030> important<00:03:16.599> kind<00:03:16.810> of

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
handbrake turns very important kind of

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.509 
handbrake turns very important kind of
the<00:03:17.019> basics<00:03:17.500> for<00:03:17.650> your<00:03:17.799> drifting<00:03:18.099> as<00:03:18.250> well<00:03:18.400> if

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
the basics for your drifting as well if

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.309 
the basics for your drifting as well if
you<00:03:18.610> can<00:03:18.730> do<00:03:18.849> a<00:03:18.880> controlled<00:03:19.390> handbrake<00:03:20.049> turn

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
you can do a controlled handbrake turn

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:23.759 
you can do a controlled handbrake turn
put<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.280> car<00:03:21.489> for<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.959> 180-degree<00:03:22.959> turn<00:03:23.230> facing

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:23.769 
put the car for a 180-degree turn facing

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.440 
put the car for a 180-degree turn facing
the<00:03:23.860> other<00:03:23.920> way<00:03:24.040> you<00:03:24.640> can<00:03:24.730> do<00:03:24.879> that<00:03:25.030> slick<00:03:25.329> and

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:25.450 
the other way you can do that slick and

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:27.059 
the other way you can do that slick and
smooth<00:03:25.750> then<00:03:26.379> that's<00:03:26.590> the<00:03:26.680> start<00:03:26.950> of<00:03:26.980> your

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:27.069 
smooth then that's the start of your

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:28.259 
smooth then that's the start of your
dripping<00:03:27.280> basically<00:03:27.760> so<00:03:27.970> we're<00:03:28.090> going<00:03:28.180> to

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
dripping basically so we're going to

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.300 
dripping basically so we're going to
explain<00:03:28.510> two<00:03:28.810> types<00:03:29.140> in<00:03:29.349> 180<00:03:29.709> degree<00:03:30.069> turns

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
explain two types in 180 degree turns

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.069 
explain two types in 180 degree turns
for<00:03:30.610> you<00:03:30.760> the<00:03:31.030> handbrake<00:03:31.450> turn<00:03:31.660> and<00:03:31.930> the

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
for you the handbrake turn and the

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.190 
for you the handbrake turn and the
clutch<00:03:32.290> turn<00:03:32.590> here<00:03:32.980> we<00:03:33.099> go<00:03:33.220> for<00:03:33.400> a<00:03:33.430> hand<00:03:33.610> right

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
clutch turn here we go for a hand right

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.750 
clutch turn here we go for a hand right
forlán<00:03:35.200> brake<00:03:35.470> turn<00:03:35.709> off<00:03:36.360> power<00:03:37.360> out

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:53.349 

and<00:03:40.760> we've<00:03:40.909> gone<00:03:41.060> on<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.329> road<00:03:41.510> very<00:03:42.200> nice<00:03:52.359> now

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:53.359 
and we've gone on the road very nice now

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:54.610 
and we've gone on the road very nice now
we're<00:03:53.510> gonna<00:03:53.629> do<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.870> same<00:03:54.049> thing<00:03:54.290> we<00:03:54.409> want<00:03:54.560> to

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:54.620 
we're gonna do the same thing we want to

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.589 
we're gonna do the same thing we want to
get<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.769> car<00:03:54.980> through<00:03:55.159> 180<00:03:55.760> degrees

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:01.970 

instead<00:04:01.019> of<00:04:01.140> using<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.379> hand<00:04:01.590> brakes<00:04:01.799> I've

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
instead of using the hand brakes I've

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.229 
instead of using the hand brakes I've
set<00:04:02.189> the<00:04:02.249> back<00:04:02.400> of<00:04:02.519> the<00:04:02.579> car<00:04:02.760> we're<00:04:02.969> just<00:04:03.120> going

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
to dip the clutch feeding a load of

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.530 
to dip the clutch feeding a load of
power<00:04:04.739> pop<00:04:05.069> it<00:04:05.189> out<00:04:05.310> hard<00:04:05.609> that<00:04:06.269> will<00:04:06.389> get<00:04:06.510> a

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
power pop it out hard that will get a

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.690 
power pop it out hard that will get a
back<00:04:06.810> end<00:04:07.019> spinning<00:04:07.439> round<00:04:07.590> that<00:04:08.129> line<00:04:08.430> up<00:04:08.609> the
