00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
on the inside now this is going to act

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.380 
on the inside now this is going to act
like<00:03:10.739> a<00:03:10.890> little<00:03:11.130> bit<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.459> a<00:03:11.549> glue<00:03:11.910> so<00:03:12.330> you

like a little bit of a glue so you

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.910 
like a little bit of a glue so you
really<00:03:12.780> want<00:03:12.959> to<00:03:13.049> make<00:03:13.170> sure<00:03:13.200> you<00:03:13.500> do<00:03:13.709> this

process now watch this take our brie put
it<00:03:17.430> right<00:03:17.610> in<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:17.910> corner<00:03:18.180> of<00:03:18.600> our<00:03:21.530> phyllo<00:03:22.530> and

00:03:23.289 --> 00:03:23.299 
it right in the corner of our phyllo and

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.080 
it right in the corner of our phyllo and
then<00:03:24.299> we<00:03:24.480> just<00:03:24.720> start<00:03:25.410> making<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.890> triangle<00:03:26.250> so

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
then we just start making a triangle so

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.330 
then we just start making a triangle so
we<00:03:27.269> turn<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.140> once<00:03:29.150> turn<00:03:30.150> it<00:03:30.329> twice<00:03:31.340> three

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
we turn it once turn it twice three

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.210 
we turn it once turn it twice three
times<00:03:33.410> four<00:03:34.410> times<00:03:35.269> five<00:03:36.269> times<00:03:36.829> we<00:03:37.829> put<00:03:38.100> them

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
times four times five times we put them

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.819 
times four times five times we put them
right<00:03:38.370> on<00:03:38.430> our<00:03:38.700> baking<00:03:39.090> sheet<00:03:39.359> and<00:03:39.650> you<00:03:40.650> can
