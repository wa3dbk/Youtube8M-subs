00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.339 
look like it's all centered and certain
angles<00:02:07.890> because<00:02:08.340> my<00:02:09.300> face<00:02:09.539> is<00:02:09.569> not<00:02:09.989> straight

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
angles because my face is not straight

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.220 
angles because my face is not straight
my<00:02:11.250> nose<00:02:11.430> is<00:02:11.580> not<00:02:11.730> straight<00:02:12.090> but<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.540> is

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
I not even that don't even home I it

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.839 
I not even that don't even home I it
does<00:02:16.500> not<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.769> very<00:02:16.950> center<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.400> my<00:02:17.580> lives

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
does not the very center of my lives

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.920 
does not the very center of my lives
right<00:02:18.120> here<00:02:20.180> so<00:02:21.180> yeah<00:02:21.330> we'll<00:02:21.540> just<00:02:21.569> see<00:02:21.810> how<00:02:21.900> it

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
right here so yeah we'll just see how it

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:23.270 
right here so yeah we'll just see how it
looks<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.319> then<00:02:22.440> when<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.739> barbel<00:02:23.099> gets

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
looks and then when the barbel gets

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.280 
looks and then when the barbel gets
tighter<00:02:23.489> to<00:02:23.700> like<00:02:23.849> when<00:02:23.970> I<00:02:24.030> smile<00:02:24.360> it<00:02:24.750> moves<00:02:25.140> it

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
tighter to like when I smile it moves it

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.539 
tighter to like when I smile it moves it
to<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.500> side<00:02:25.680> because<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.099> barbell<00:02:26.459> is

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
to the side because the barbell is

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.680 
to the side because the barbell is
really<00:02:26.730> long<00:02:26.909> so<00:02:29.150> yeah<00:02:30.150> we'll<00:02:30.330> just<00:02:30.390> have<00:02:30.599> to

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
really long so yeah we'll just have to

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.839 
really long so yeah we'll just have to
see<00:02:30.750> how<00:02:31.080> it<00:02:31.140> heals<00:02:31.440> up<00:02:31.650> hopefully<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.670> doesn't

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
see how it heals up hopefully it doesn't

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.390 
see how it heals up hopefully it doesn't
look<00:02:33.060> too<00:02:33.299> drunk<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.660> on<00:02:33.780> its<00:02:33.930> healed<00:02:34.170> um<00:02:34.530> yeah

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
look too drunk it on its healed um yeah

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.430 
look too drunk it on its healed um yeah
I<00:02:35.430> can<00:02:35.610> see<00:02:35.700> like<00:02:35.849> an<00:02:35.940> angle<00:02:36.299> like<00:02:36.330> this<00:02:36.450> it

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
I can see like an angle like this it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.509 
I can see like an angle like this it
looks<00:02:37.560> really<00:02:37.769> craigy<00:02:38.040> but<00:02:38.250> it's<00:02:38.400> actually
