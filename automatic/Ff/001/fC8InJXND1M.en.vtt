00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello my ladies and gentlemen heartily 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.879
 welcome to a new last of 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.189
 wwe to pay for team today we look 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.490
 us in trins finnish and signature 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:13.469
 from the world strongest men mark henry 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.800
 Unfortunately , more than world currency is not more 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.320
 as a sexy chocolate chip e 13 but good 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.189
 that's all , so let's go 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.609
 It's purely 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.609
 have fun 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:37.290
 medicine 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.290
 sex is 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.840
 10 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.949
 more 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.320
 but stable 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:51.340
 yes, so mark henry has also in real 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.290
 not a super cool entrance but the 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.330
 is really boring age and yes 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.000
 almost to look at it completely 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.170
 It's almost a pain 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.860
 completely boring of the engines what me 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.140
 yes nothing 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.790
 I did my Canori so times not to 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.470
 whole engines in real but not 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.890
 something you could but already 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:10.780
 bring in these android 30 except 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.610
 that goes into the ring and then 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:15.730
 once through the ring, that's me 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.860
 something whatever he has completely on 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.300
 made a move at the beginning but well, well 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.890
 Let's take a look at the world 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.890
 strongest slam I would say that 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.909
 and here was another bit 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:48.829
 more variant of the fischerer though 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:51.439
 I'm here exactly as with kanye 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:52.790
 say he has or is here 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:54.379
 just like kane actually it's 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.549
 not worse here this finisher 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.370
 you just throw yourself before 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:00.260
 once up and catch him more again 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.819
 he does not take swing if he does 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.090
 now would throw in high and then 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:06.980
 directly when you get down then it will 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:09.680
 something else but is not so well 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.790
 that was signature finnish and and 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.709
 runs by marc emery 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.049
 This time someone from 4ing has again 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.970
 abbekommt addition, we are always there for bmw 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.859
 is this cool but a cool one 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.689
 thing except the rest of my life 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.769
 that was it from me we'll see each other 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:24.609
 Next time again bite then stays 

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:24.609
