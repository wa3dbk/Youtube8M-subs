00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.420
 four avenues 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.689

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.000

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.910

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:00.080
 when we had to burst we arrived 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.620

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.100

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.400
 wall 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.760

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.760

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.640

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:35.060
