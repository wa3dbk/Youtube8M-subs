00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
properly yesterday so I haven't had more

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.590 
properly yesterday so I haven't had more
than<00:03:27.750> just<00:03:27.810> a<00:03:28.170> couple<00:03:28.500> hours<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.100> practice<00:03:29.600> I

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
than just a couple hours of practice I

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.260 
than just a couple hours of practice I
do<00:03:31.080> lock<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:32.040> call<00:03:32.250> off<00:03:32.489> occasionally

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
do lock the call off occasionally

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.660

because I believe I'm blowing too hard I

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.280 
because I believe I'm blowing too hard I
think<00:03:36.239> that's<00:03:36.660> just<00:03:36.840> going<00:03:37.020> to<00:03:37.110> come<00:03:37.260> up

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
think that's just going to come up

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.350 
think that's just going to come up
experience<00:03:38.040> where<00:03:38.520> I<00:03:38.550> can<00:03:38.790> get<00:03:38.880> my<00:03:38.940> tongue<00:03:39.239> to

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
experience where I can get my tongue to

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.830 
experience where I can get my tongue to
flutter<00:03:39.600> with<00:03:39.870> less<00:03:40.110> air<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:42.090> now<00:03:42.360> I'll<00:03:42.660> give

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
flutter with less air so now I'll give

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.820 
flutter with less air so now I'll give
it<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.959> shot<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:44.120> again<00:03:45.120> these<00:03:45.900> are<00:03:46.320> not<00:03:46.680> going
