00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.140 

the<00:00:18.260> chemical<00:00:18.740> era<00:00:18.950> of<00:00:19.370> Agriculture<00:00:20.120> is

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150 
the chemical era of Agriculture is

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.460 
the chemical era of Agriculture is
actually<00:00:20.570> over<00:00:20.780> it's<00:00:21.710> finished<00:00:23.080> it<00:00:24.080> failed

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
actually over it's finished it failed

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.000 
actually over it's finished it failed
and<00:00:25.660> we're<00:00:26.660> now<00:00:26.780> going<00:00:27.020> into<00:00:27.170> a<00:00:27.350> biological

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.010 
and we're now going into a biological

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.890 
and we're now going into a biological
era<00:00:28.190> and<00:00:28.750> that<00:00:29.750> is<00:00:30.110> all<00:00:30.410> about<00:00:30.740> understanding

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:31.900 
era and that is all about understanding

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.770 
era and that is all about understanding
the<00:00:32.900> life<00:00:33.410> in<00:00:33.650> the<00:00:33.740> soil<00:00:34.240> there<00:00:35.240> we<00:00:35.630> know

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:35.780 
the life in the soil there we know

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.710 
the life in the soil there we know
nothing<00:00:36.020> about<00:00:36.320> the<00:00:36.620> life<00:00:36.770> in<00:00:36.950> the<00:00:37.040> soil<00:00:37.720> about

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:38.720 
nothing about the life in the soil about

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.280 
nothing about the life in the soil about
1%<00:00:39.080> of<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.730> organisms<00:00:40.730> are<00:00:40.970> very<00:00:41.510> basically

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
1% of the organisms are very basically

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.730 
1% of the organisms are very basically
understood<00:00:42.920> a<00:00:43.040> little<00:00:43.340> bit<00:00:44.380> because<00:00:45.380> we've

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
understood a little bit because we've

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.240 
understood a little bit because we've
ignored<00:00:45.950> it<00:00:46.340> for<00:00:46.370> 150<00:00:47.090> years<00:00:47.420> since<00:00:47.900> we<00:00:48.250> learnt

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
ignored it for 150 years since we learnt

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.500 
ignored it for 150 years since we learnt
how<00:00:49.430> to<00:00:49.490> manufacture<00:00:50.420> sulfuric<00:00:51.380> acid<00:00:51.800> and

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.510 
how to manufacture sulfuric acid and

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.930 
how to manufacture sulfuric acid and
dissolve<00:00:53.510> rocks<00:00:53.810> into<00:00:54.140> soluble<00:00:54.920> salt<00:00:55.700> based

dissolve rocks into soluble salt based

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.870 
dissolve rocks into soluble salt based
fertilizer<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.920> now<00:00:57.920> we've<00:00:58.190> come<00:00:58.489> to<00:00:58.760> the

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
fertilizer and now we've come to the

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.079 
fertilizer and now we've come to the
edge<00:00:59.030> of<00:01:01.810> environmental<00:01:02.810> destruction<00:01:04.089> mainly

edge of environmental destruction mainly
fueled<00:01:05.449> by<00:01:05.479> that<00:01:05.780> process<00:01:06.080> and<00:01:06.909> we're<00:01:07.909> running

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
fueled by that process and we're running

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.450 
fueled by that process and we're running
out<00:01:08.390> of<00:01:08.420> water<00:01:08.630> that's<00:01:08.990> any<00:01:09.409> good<00:01:09.590> and<00:01:10.159> we're

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
out of water that's any good and we're

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.160 
out of water that's any good and we're
running<00:01:10.550> out<00:01:10.850> of<00:01:10.880> soil<00:01:11.240> and<00:01:13.240> we've<00:01:14.240> got<00:01:14.510> a<00:01:14.720> lot

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
running out of soil and we've got a lot

of crisis on our hands but we've we've

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.590 
of crisis on our hands but we've we've
definitely<00:01:18.770> got<00:01:19.010> a<00:01:19.040> food<00:01:19.280> crisis<00:01:19.790> coming<00:01:20.420> up

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
definitely got a food crisis coming up

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.550 
definitely got a food crisis coming up
very<00:01:20.750> quick<00:01:22.030> and<00:01:23.030> it's<00:01:23.659> not<00:01:23.840> so<00:01:23.990> obvious<00:01:24.020> to

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
very quick and it's not so obvious to

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.930 
very quick and it's not so obvious to
all<00:01:24.680> of<00:01:24.830> us<00:01:25.960> we've<00:01:26.960> got<00:01:26.990> a<00:01:27.430> climate<00:01:28.430> crisis<00:01:28.909> a

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:28.940 
all of us we've got a climate crisis a

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.750 
all of us we've got a climate crisis a
water<00:01:29.270> crisis<00:01:29.869> a<00:01:30.049> financial<00:01:30.740> climate<00:01:30.950> crisis

a<00:01:31.970> fossil<00:01:32.930> fuel<00:01:33.200> crisis<00:01:33.710> we've<00:01:34.070> been<00:01:34.220> running

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
a fossil fuel crisis we've been running

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.460 
a fossil fuel crisis we've been running
on<00:01:34.610> fossilized<00:01:35.119> sunlight<00:01:35.630> for<00:01:35.960> a<00:01:35.990> long<00:01:36.170> time

now 100 years and we really just been

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.480 
now 100 years and we really just been
cheating<00:01:39.979> time<00:01:41.590> we<00:01:42.590> just<00:01:42.770> drive<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:42.979> car<00:01:43.310> for

cheating time we just drive a car for

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.250 
cheating time we just drive a car for
half<00:01:43.670> an<00:01:43.909> hour<00:01:44.060> or<00:01:44.360> 20<00:01:44.840> minutes<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:45.400> we<00:01:46.400> just

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
half an hour or 20 minutes and we just

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.570 
half an hour or 20 minutes and we just
use<00:01:48.260> a<00:01:48.290> hundred<00:01:48.710> years<00:01:48.920> with<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.130> sunlight

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
use a hundred years with a sunlight

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.039 
use a hundred years with a sunlight
that's<00:01:49.850> been<00:01:50.030> shining<00:01:50.270> on<00:01:50.479> one<00:01:50.689> acre<00:01:50.840> of

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
that's been shining on one acre of

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.250 
that's been shining on one acre of
prehistoric<00:01:51.350> forest<00:01:52.270> that's<00:01:53.270> very<00:01:53.570> clever

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
prehistoric forest that's very clever

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.170 
prehistoric forest that's very clever
it's<00:01:55.930> incredibly<00:01:56.930> advanced<00:01:57.740> technology<00:01:58.340> but

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180 
it's incredibly advanced technology but

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.130 
it's incredibly advanced technology but
if<00:02:00.049> we<00:02:00.110> base<00:02:00.560> our<00:02:00.920> whole<00:02:01.220> design<00:02:01.909> life<00:02:02.450> systems

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
if we base our whole design life systems

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.050 
if we base our whole design life systems
on<00:02:03.380> that<00:02:03.799> and<00:02:04.009> we<00:02:04.250> don't<00:02:04.400> know<00:02:04.580> how<00:02:04.610> to<00:02:04.790> design

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
on that and we don't know how to design

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.309 
on that and we don't know how to design
in<00:02:05.420> real<00:02:05.659> time<00:02:05.990> in<00:02:06.259> real<00:02:06.560> sunlight<00:02:07.040> hours<00:02:07.250> and

00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
in real time in real sunlight hours and

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.719 
in real time in real sunlight hours and
suddenly<00:02:09.319> that<00:02:09.499> system<00:02:09.919> falls<00:02:10.159> over<00:02:10.519> we've

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
suddenly that system falls over we've

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.350 
suddenly that system falls over we've
got<00:02:10.879> a<00:02:10.909> very<00:02:11.120> big<00:02:11.389> problem

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
got a very big problem

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.650 
got a very big problem
because<00:02:13.750> we<00:02:13.900> just<00:02:14.080> don't<00:02:14.320> know<00:02:14.560> how<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.660> exist

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
because we just don't know how to exist

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.910 
because we just don't know how to exist
in<00:02:17.730> assistant<00:02:18.730> where<00:02:18.880> we're<00:02:19.060> not<00:02:19.090> cheating

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920

in assistant where we're not cheating
sunlight<00:02:21.600> kidding<00:02:22.600> time<00:02:22.840> really<00:02:23.640> you<00:02:24.640> haven't

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
sunlight kidding time really you haven't

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.540 
sunlight kidding time really you haven't
got<00:02:25.270> a<00:02:25.450> hundred<00:02:25.870> years<00:02:26.140> of<00:02:26.410> sunlight<00:02:26.770> on<00:02:27.070> one

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
got a hundred years of sunlight on one

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.300

acre<00:02:27.730> of<00:02:27.970> forest<00:02:28.540> to<00:02:28.720> spend<00:02:29.020> you've<00:02:29.860> got<00:02:30.100> one

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
acre of forest to spend you've got one

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.190 
acre of forest to spend you've got one
hour<00:02:30.490> of<00:02:30.640> sunlight<00:02:30.820> on<00:02:31.240> one<00:02:31.480> acre<00:02:31.630> forest<00:02:34.200> so

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
hour of sunlight on one acre forest so

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.080 
hour of sunlight on one acre forest so
you're<00:02:35.380> into<00:02:35.650> a<00:02:35.680> different<00:02:36.340> sort<00:02:36.550> of<00:02:36.640> time

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
you're into a different sort of time

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.760 
you're into a different sort of time
frame<00:02:37.120> and<00:02:37.660> that's<00:02:37.990> what<00:02:38.170> we<00:02:38.290> do<00:02:38.440> with<00:02:38.590> people

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
frame and that's what we do with people

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.740 
frame and that's what we do with people
would<00:02:39.040> you<00:02:39.400> know<00:02:39.520> we<00:02:39.670> explain<00:02:40.300> what<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.630> is

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
would you know we explain what it is

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.000 
would you know we explain what it is
that<00:02:41.140> you<00:02:41.260> need<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.560> understand<00:02:42.100> about<00:02:44.010> the

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
that you need to understand about the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.040 
that you need to understand about the
carbon<00:02:45.459> exchange<00:02:45.700> between<00:02:46.150> sunlight<00:02:46.870> and

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
carbon pathways of ecosystems and added

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.860 
carbon pathways of ecosystems and added
design<00:02:55.030> those<00:02:55.239> ecosystems<00:02:55.870> so<00:02:56.590> they<00:02:56.770> benefit

design those ecosystems so they benefit

design those ecosystems so they benefit

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
quite a different design it's not that

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.479 
quite a different design it's not that
it's<00:03:16.750> not<00:03:16.959> very<00:03:17.200> much<00:03:17.680> like<00:03:17.980> what<00:03:18.190> we've<00:03:18.340> got

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:18.489 
it's not very much like what we've got

a<00:04:19.030> you<00:04:19.660> know<00:04:19.750> the<00:04:19.870> present<00:04:20.260> systems<00:04:20.680> are

a you know the present systems are

a you know the present systems are

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
leading those nowhere really it's just a

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:27.180 
leading those nowhere really it's just a
black<00:04:24.160> hole<00:04:24.370> and<00:04:25.289> we're<00:04:26.289> even<00:04:26.680> right<00:04:26.890> now

propping up financial systems I mean I'm

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.840 
propping up financial systems I mean I'm
kind<00:04:30.070> of<00:04:30.160> glad<00:04:30.430> we<00:04:30.700> are<00:04:31.860> because<00:04:32.860> I'd<00:04:33.040> like<00:04:33.340> it

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:33.850 
kind of glad we are because I'd like it

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.380 
kind of glad we are because I'd like it

to be a softer landing out of the

to be a softer landing out of the
present<00:04:37.840> era<00:04:38.430> but<00:04:39.430> I<00:04:39.640> just<00:04:40.000> hope<00:04:40.210> it<00:04:40.600> doesn't

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
present era but I just hope it doesn't

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.470 
present era but I just hope it doesn't
just<00:04:41.080> fall<00:04:41.230> over<00:04:41.290> very<00:04:41.800> fast<00:04:42.160> because<00:04:42.730> it's<00:04:43.210> a

just fall over very fast because it's a

just fall over very fast because it's a
it's<00:04:43.750> not<00:04:43.960> going<00:04:44.140> to<00:04:44.230> be<00:04:44.380> such<00:04:45.190> a<00:04:45.220> nice<00:04:45.660> crash
