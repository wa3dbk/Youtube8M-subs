has<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.320> little<00:01:16.710> bit<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.890> a<00:01:16.979> fresh<00:01:17.310> smell<00:01:17.580> or

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
has a little bit of a fresh smell or

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.950 
has a little bit of a fresh smell or
something<00:01:18.390> that's<00:01:18.630> tinted<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:20.210> tude<00:01:21.240> it's

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
something that's tinted to tude it's

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960 
something that's tinted to tude it's
like<00:01:22.080> orange<00:01:22.439> e<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.100> I<00:01:23.130> thought<00:01:23.549> that<00:01:23.729> supposed

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
like orange e so I thought that supposed

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.890 
like orange e so I thought that supposed
to<00:01:24.030> color<00:01:24.360> correct<00:01:24.840> or<00:01:25.259> what<00:01:25.560> but<00:01:26.689> it<00:01:27.689> really

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
to color correct or what but it really

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.749 
to color correct or what but it really
doesn't<00:01:28.200> show<00:01:28.380> up<00:01:29.659> but<00:01:30.659> I<00:01:31.280> don't<00:01:32.280> feel<00:01:32.490> like

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
doesn't show up but I don't feel like

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.149 
doesn't show up but I don't feel like
this<00:01:34.369> smooths<00:01:35.369> my<00:01:35.670> lines<00:01:36.090> really<00:01:36.990> or<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.770> does

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
this smooths my lines really or it does

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:41.749

even<00:01:38.640> out<00:01:38.790> my<00:01:38.820> skin<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.400> makes<00:01:41.579> my

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
even out my skin and it makes my

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.440 
even out my skin and it makes my

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
fingers just because some people don't

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.910 
fingers just because some people don't

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.400 
know brushes can give it a different
look<00:02:17.070> to<00:02:17.580> so<00:02:17.940> there's<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.450> many<00:02:18.570> brushes<00:02:19.200> I

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
look to so there's so many brushes I

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.980 
look to so there's so many brushes I
just<00:02:19.860> thought<00:02:20.120> let's<00:02:21.120> use<00:02:21.510> the<00:02:21.750> fingers<00:02:22.940> so

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
just thought let's use the fingers so

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.720 
just thought let's use the fingers so
with<00:02:24.990> uh<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:28.080> first<00:02:28.440> layer<00:02:28.860> it's<00:02:29.160> got<00:02:29.430> pretty

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
with uh the first layer it's got pretty

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.490 
with uh the first layer it's got pretty
good<00:02:29.880> coverage<00:02:30.600> it's<00:02:30.870> got<00:02:32.209> like<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.900> medium

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
good coverage it's got like to medium

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.270 
good coverage it's got like to medium
coverage<00:02:34.830> with<00:02:35.790> one<00:02:36.030> layer<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:37.070> would<00:02:38.070> say

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
coverage with one layer I would say

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:46.580 
coverage with one layer I would say
light<00:02:41.630> weight<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:42.810> medium<00:02:44.330> I<00:02:45.330> really<00:02:46.260> think

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
light weight to medium I really think

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.699 
light weight to medium I really think
that<00:02:46.770> the<00:02:47.310> coverage<00:02:47.880> is<00:02:48.120> really<00:02:48.709> comparable

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
that the coverage is really comparable

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.000 
that the coverage is really comparable
to<00:02:50.040> real<00:02:50.670> true<00:02:51.150> much<00:02:51.390> just<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:51.989> original<00:02:52.230> try

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
to real true much just the original try

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.940 
to real true much just the original try
match<00:02:53.360> the<00:02:54.410> finish<00:02:55.410> is<00:02:57.049> like<00:02:58.049> a<00:02:58.230> natural

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
match the finish is like a natural

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.800 
match the finish is like a natural
finish<00:02:59.280> it's<00:02:59.730> not<00:03:00.060> dry<00:03:00.570> it's<00:03:01.080> not<00:03:01.260> dewy<00:03:02.040> I

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
finish it's not dry it's not dewy I

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.400 
finish it's not dry it's not dewy I
guess<00:03:03.810> that<00:03:04.049> would<00:03:04.170> be<00:03:04.200> a<00:03:04.350> Sutton<00:03:05.010> huh<00:03:05.720> so<00:03:06.720> yeah

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
guess that would be a Sutton huh so yeah

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.259 
guess that would be a Sutton huh so yeah
I<00:03:07.650> really<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.370> finish<00:03:08.580> it's<00:03:08.910> really

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
I really like the finish it's really

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:15.280 
I really like the finish it's really
natural-looking<00:03:12.440> so<00:03:13.440> that's<00:03:13.680> one<00:03:13.980> layer

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
good while the it's not as long as the

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.750 
good while the it's not as long as the
Revlon<00:06:07.780> Colorstay<00:06:08.110> but<00:06:08.740> it<00:06:09.130> lasts<00:06:09.430> a<00:06:09.610> good

Revlon Colorstay but it lasts a good
while<00:06:10.380> and<00:06:11.380> I<00:06:11.680> really<00:06:11.950> like<00:06:12.130> it<00:06:12.310> the<00:06:12.400> only

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
while and I really like it the only

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:15.390 
while and I really like it the only
problem<00:06:12.970> is<00:06:13.060> covering<00:06:14.040> matching<00:06:15.040> your<00:06:15.160> skin

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:15.400 
problem is covering matching your skin

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.130 
problem is covering matching your skin
tone<00:06:15.610> so<00:06:15.790> they<00:06:15.850> don't<00:06:16.030> have<00:06:16.210> very<00:06:16.390> many<00:06:16.630> shades

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
tone so they don't have very many shades

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:20.220 
tone so they don't have very many shades
not<00:06:17.530> sure<00:06:17.800> how<00:06:18.010> many<00:06:18.090> but<00:06:19.090> I<00:06:19.630> think<00:06:19.990> they<00:06:20.140> had

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:20.230 
not sure how many but I think they had

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:23.610 
not sure how many but I think they had
like<00:06:20.260> one<00:06:20.770> maybe<00:06:21.640> two<00:06:22.120> darker<00:06:23.050> ones<00:06:23.230> than<00:06:23.440> this

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:23.620 
like one maybe two darker ones than this

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.980 
like one maybe two darker ones than this
which<00:06:23.920> is<00:06:24.100> so<00:06:24.910> wrong<00:06:25.210> so<00:06:25.720> wrong
