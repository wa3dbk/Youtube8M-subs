00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
of these up at a flea market this is a

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.950 
of these up at a flea market this is a
little<00:00:23.519> bit<00:00:23.609> different<00:00:23.970> from<00:00:24.090> my<00:00:24.210> usual<00:00:24.420> fare

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
little bit different from my usual fare

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.689 
little bit different from my usual fare
of<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.289> high-class<00:00:25.470> Nintendo<00:00:26.310> Game<00:00:26.519> &amp;<00:00:26.670> Watch

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
of the high-class Nintendo Game &amp; Watch

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.269 
of the high-class Nintendo Game &amp; Watch
but<00:00:27.480> this<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.019> an<00:00:28.140> LCD<00:00:28.439> game<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:28.949> I<00:00:28.980> thought<00:00:29.189> it

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
but this is an LCD game and I thought it

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.589 
but this is an LCD game and I thought it
would<00:00:29.400> probably<00:00:29.519> be<00:00:29.730> worth<00:00:29.880> covering<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
would probably be worth covering on the

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:31.880 
would probably be worth covering on the
show<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:30.960> then<00:00:31.080> some<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.380> guys<00:00:31.500> might<00:00:31.740> get

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
show and then some of you guys might get

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.760 
show and then some of you guys might get
a<00:00:31.949> kick<00:00:32.189> out<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:33.180> is<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.390> PCP<00:00:33.899> station

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
backlight which actually makes kind of a

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.800 
backlight which actually makes kind of a
big<00:03:17.139> difference<00:03:17.290> see<00:03:18.359> the<00:03:19.359> sounds<00:03:19.720> are
