00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.500 
going to do this finger wave on dry hair
but<00:00:28.859> I'm<00:00:28.980> just<00:00:29.220> gonna<00:00:29.340> start<00:00:29.699> by<00:00:29.789> really<00:00:30.210> kind

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
but I'm just gonna start by really kind

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.330 
but I'm just gonna start by really kind
of<00:00:30.570> saturating<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> hair<00:00:31.410> with<00:00:31.560> gel<00:00:31.800> so<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.160> get

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
of saturating the hair with gel so I get

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.639 
of saturating the hair with gel so I get
a<00:00:32.369> really<00:00:32.640> clean<00:00:32.940> look<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:33.450> like<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.170> actually

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
a really clean look I like to actually

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.490 
a really clean look I like to actually
put<00:00:34.860> my<00:00:34.890> gel<00:00:35.340> right<00:00:36.090> close<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.170> scalp

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
put my gel right close to the scalp

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.959 
put my gel right close to the scalp
because<00:00:37.739> I<00:00:37.950> think<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.250> helps<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.579> finger<00:00:38.850> wave

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
because I think it helps the finger wave

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.250 
because I think it helps the finger wave
sit<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.329> little<00:00:39.570> bit<00:00:39.719> tighter

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
sit a little bit tighter

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.920 
sit a little bit tighter
so<00:00:40.890> I'm<00:00:40.950> just<00:00:41.160> taking<00:00:41.610> some<00:00:41.879> sections<00:00:42.600> through

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
so I'm just taking some sections through

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.180 
so I'm just taking some sections through
all<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.200> hair<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.379> I'm<00:00:43.530> going<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.680> be<00:00:43.800> waving

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
all the hair that I'm going to be waving

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.299 
all the hair that I'm going to be waving
and<00:00:44.399> starting<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.750> apply<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.170> gel<00:00:46.440> there<00:00:46.620> so

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
and starting to apply the gel there so

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.729 
and starting to apply the gel there so
to<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.640> this<00:00:47.820> wave<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.270> I'm<00:00:48.570> just<00:00:48.899> holding<00:00:49.649> a

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
to get this wave in I'm just holding a

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.830 
to get this wave in I'm just holding a
hair<00:00:49.920> in<00:00:50.010> place<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:50.370> my<00:00:50.550> fingers<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:51.420> then

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
hair in place with my fingers and then

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.740 
hair in place with my fingers and then
I'm<00:00:51.960> using<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.620> comb<00:00:52.860> right<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.250> the<00:00:53.340> scalp

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
I'm using the comb right on the scalp

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.090 
I'm using the comb right on the scalp
pulling<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.840> hair<00:00:55.050> forward<00:00:55.469> into<00:00:55.829> the<00:00:55.920> wave

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
pulling the hair forward into the wave

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.520 
pulling the hair forward into the wave
and<00:00:56.460> then<00:00:57.030> securing<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.750> and<00:00:57.960> just<00:00:58.140> coming<00:00:58.320> it

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
and then securing it and just coming it

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:18.620 
and then securing it and just coming it
back<00:00:58.649> down<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:58.980> play<00:01:17.150> so<00:01:18.150> one<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.450> key

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
back down and play so one of the key

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.929 
back down and play so one of the key
points<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.020> getting<00:01:19.229> a<00:01:19.380> clean<00:01:19.950> wave<00:01:20.159> if<00:01:20.729> you

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
points to getting a clean wave if you

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.460 
points to getting a clean wave if you
really<00:01:21.180> apply<00:01:21.420> enough<00:01:21.659> pressure<00:01:21.689> towards<00:01:22.320> the

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
really apply enough pressure towards the

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.340 
really apply enough pressure towards the
head<00:01:22.650> so<00:01:23.280> even<00:01:23.820> if<00:01:23.939> your<00:01:24.090> client<00:01:24.540> can<00:01:24.869> push

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
head so even if your client can push

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.840 
head so even if your client can push
back<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.650> little<00:01:25.890> bit<00:01:26.070> against<00:01:26.369> your<00:01:26.549> finger
