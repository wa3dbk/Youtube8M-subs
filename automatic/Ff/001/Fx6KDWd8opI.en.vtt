00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
 hey look for Mike Attinger en 

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:04.680
 today i'm going to leave you very cool folder 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.200
 At least it's a dead normal 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.910
 survivor mom and you know it will not 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.010
 already put a description and already 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.809
 a little woman i explain it just one 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:14.250
 the down link is in the description 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.470
 you may think of why species 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.420
 protects you a piece of normal normal folder 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.730
 but it is not because it is one 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.250
 very special folder because the first you can 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.619
 fly in this folder in survival are two 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.720
 who can throw infinite eggs in it 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.330
 survival in this folder 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.579
 and you can here yes you just go 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.440
 do not die in this basket it is crazy to 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.360
 show crazy take it easy and then 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.860
 yes that is very fresh, I am flying 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.540
 just a fizzy 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.890
 and then like me you can't die either 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.420
 well no shows 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.940
 I don't fall dead I never hear 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.129
 fall but I fall not dead and I 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.260
 don't know yes one this is some things 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.350
 modified in this folder which means that 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.410
 this is actually possible and yes how nice 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.640
 is also that if you have someone there 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.210
 just a friend of yours for example you 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.210
 world choice 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.940
 it's just that he can't do this for him 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.650
 still normal he can pair just still 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.060
 always 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.680
 how many eggs to collect 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.390
 for example throwing 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.010
 only you and he can't fly either 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.180
 he can also just die alone 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.850
 you have this 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.830
 never this yes these extras you can 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.780
 the voice and the only one in this folder then 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.460
 who could fly 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.960
 yes my only one who didn't die and the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.729
 only person who can finally throw that 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.340
 very handy also just for when you are with 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.290
 your friends are playing and you 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.720
 have made a very nice folder only 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.430
 you want to make sure that nobody 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.710
 Broken market well the jug for example 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.079
 just enter the year in this folder 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.909
 build and then you can just self Deveron 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.159
 fly and see if everything is in order 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.720
 far so it is also at best fat in it 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.920
 kind of yes i don't want one 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.259
 water hole 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.299
 with sand around it we see one here 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.430
 kind of snowball you more is a bit 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.290
 snow with those snow trees so that 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.540
 can also simply fill in beautiful 5 because it is 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.560
 also other trees in and also a kind of 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:02.790
 mountain and yes your head still ice and whole 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.200
 lots of pigs and yes down to gravel 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.729
 and I'm going from that shows you don't 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.890
 can die because then I will have them 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.629
 so you put this in 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.730
 if you like this here you are on your own 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.170
 but all of course I care about that 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:15.540
 their one only takes so long 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.690
 this I just still survival today as 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.239
 I do this already what I am now going myself 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.959
 include a little bit like this 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:24.540
 do it 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.450
 I am now stuck in a block but like you 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.310
 see I will not die and that is still 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.790
 a reason to actually see me 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:32.100
 don't die 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.530
 well I'm gonna try the water myself 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.090
 stop and then this this a bit too long 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.540
 but have now just seen you can 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.700
 don't die i can kill i i 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.920
 can't drown and you can't get stuck 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.420
 is somewhere in you just can't die 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.819
 you can throw the eggs online too 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.470
 actually infinite chickens because right 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.569
 just hot it throws chicken come naturally 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.980
 and then you will get even throw it 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:54.540
 actually just endless chickens because 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.970
 you just called it injustice 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.709
 throw say so I already see him now 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.130
 two chickens and they go on a dating 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.840
 and then slide with a hug no landeghem 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.019
 once again that him and the only one you 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.640
 again no one else can least 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:10.920
 if you are in your folder , you are the only one 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.900
 who can do it and it is no longer all of you 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.000
 folders then or thrones only in this folder 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.830
 it can not it when you have it 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.690
 that there are also in all other folders 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:21.390
 it doesn't really work that way in this one 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.370
 folder so if you use this mark 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:24.690
 and want to be a survivaler you really need the most 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.489
 going to survive 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.380
 and yes it works just as if 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.109
 you're actually in titties because you can 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.609
 flying you can die i can infinity 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:37.230
 own throw and and 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.880
 the only thing is that you are just normal 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.190
 should simply block all still doubtful 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.630
 take a while to chop up like this 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.820
 sees the will now it will be just as long 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.459
 just like the real survival something 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:49.650
 survival game mode so this is actually 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.170
 these directories really make a short video to that 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.880
 actually quite a quick explanation is one 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.590
 pretty quick to laciness i hope trump 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.540
 crazy why would a club like me too 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:02.100
 Already flying ok I thank you for that 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:04.140
 by the way, watching is even more so 

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:06.329
 tree this tree are there so you can do this 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.389
 use wood that brothers need 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.920
 or so must be in the back that must 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:13.019
 I do n't know what it's called but this is it 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.160
 a very old saying but ever too big 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.039
 boxes 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.959
 I think this is a scrooge 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.910
 i think i am not c yes it is was 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.380
 good bullshit is just watching as i like it 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.639
 I could have it in my inventory 

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:27.199
 see what it's called 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:30.860
 I already had yes yes I had the right spruce 

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:33.139
 we need something 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.910
 ok she kia it as you see it quic 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.580
 so a bit because they have those directories with 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.300
 you have adjusted but this is good 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.349
 so very now the space is bleeding too girl 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.150
 as well just this is all my 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.500
 don't move the pup that I think 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.780
 but because they have a little bit 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.889
 adapted imambuks team bit one 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.270
 probably first talk about now 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.889
 then start it again 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.780
 but it is this river of the map 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:55.009
 who can fly infinitely online you can 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.680
 throw eggs online 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:59.930
 do not die and fly then I have suit 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.550
 said and you understand now think 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:03.889
 then left it in the description so want 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:05.630
 you survive this here in yourself 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.139
 link to this master 10 a 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:07.550
 Description 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.380
 you don't know how to download folder 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.120
 look at the previous video I think 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.710
 and then you know how that works no 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.319
 kubrick for needed influence of needed 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.909
