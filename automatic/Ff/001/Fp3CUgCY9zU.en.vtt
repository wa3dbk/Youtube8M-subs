00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:12.850
 I think it can use towards that various dj 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:14.800
 Anyway this waterfall's size is said to be with other controller and home controller Kamiya 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.240
 Absolute to bar controller 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.360
 But in Is not it absolutely 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.130
 It is almost the same as this 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:30.670
 Maki I heard I'm held together well up Shaved got was almost nothing that has 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:34.480
 That's why it's not like this 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:37.750
 It is waterfall wildness x pace 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:44.140
 I see that I landed there 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:48.640
 I guess that was my previous big pretend 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:54.470
 I guess it's only a guess I'm wrong at home I'm really sure 6 machines individually 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:58.460
 It's been 4 days and it's been a while since it's been out for a while, so it's just now 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:01:01.940
 It 's a story that I'm taking a video, but I miss that little time 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:07.250
 I'm in a state I can not do for a while 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.850
 But after all this is what I must do today and I can do it today 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.670
 Absent 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.320
 It is not because I became 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.340
 That really 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.340
 The price is better 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:23.310
 Well say quite pricey 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:27.299
 Each in the shape person I Best time Best also umaibō 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:34.010
 I wonder if it will be a hype to draw 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:37.220
 That's why I can not sue Lodi Otaruko-chan guru who was sued about 1000 times 

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:38.280
 Cheap of about say that 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.659
 Ummm 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:44.759
 It is easy is bargain 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.759
 It is true that it is feeling of mark of no wonder 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.649
 This the 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:55.760
 I really thought that when I first got in touch with you, our business was over 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.430
 Other than this 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.240
 Absolutely on the other 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:06.490
 I thought it would not sell at all other than this 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.600
 In fact this is actually even so is great apart from such a thing is to say this feature at this price 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.990

 Patch bends here too . 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:17.460
 That is the width of the pitch 

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:19.370
 Although there is a high of Paid the pitch vader 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.449

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.680
 Fader cancel pits meeting I mean pitch Veda cancellation 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:48.039
 Yes 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.960
 It is to say that can go up to 100 par with even the more I see 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:53.919
 It's a huge fiber 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:58.780
 It's right after Well 

00:05:53.919 --> 00:06:00.190
 I hope you can get in the Risu group bpm Today is high school resolution Retina display 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:08.039

 I Well Well in Well this ordinary few cars station is I want you to do so met 

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:32.179
 Booneguati Massage 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:33.630
 There is no ear, but it may be said that it is a yellow shop if it is a master store other maker other than 

00:06:32.179 --> 00:06:39.570
 Change pitch 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:42.750
 But it is a master store that the tone does not change with the sound quality meeting and is called a key lock 

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:45.370
 It is something that can be done but it has no arm 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:47.330
 Just why this price 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:50.599
 Let's endure there 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:54.449
 I with it 8 Massa stores in the fact that um 

00:06:50.599 --> 00:07:01.259
 So please only be aware there, for example 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:07:04.770
 Registered rock or vocal thing corresponding after the person with his pitch back and forth intensely 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:09.300
 There may be some parts that are difficult to use 

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:12.389
 But I it I want to say give us the people of the beginner 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:14.000
 In the case of a record 1 that guys everyone did it 

00:07:12.389 --> 00:07:18.569
 bj 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:21.869
 But it doesn't matter so much 

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:24.929
 That's right I feel like I'm getting tired 

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:27.300
 Well by pos 100% 

00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:31.840
 in short 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:36.400
 -100% means that bio is slow 

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:37.300
 Too slow live Dari and this play will be or have 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.239
 so 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.430
 To put it the sweet judgment 

00:07:39.239 --> 00:07:47.300
 2 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:48.320
 Then we Well Well that about only to 100 units Figure 2 times faster 's not like this like this I wonder problem 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:53.360
 It is because 

00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:54.710
 It's like you're doing some weird people, but it's not a sideways feature, but it's probably not a feature 

00:07:53.360 --> 00:08:00.230
 I think so 

00:07:54.710 --> 00:08:04.969
 Well, to cover up to there is that freedom to the claw 

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:10.929
 Since changing this is possible ne strength to the symbolic is 

00:08:04.969 --> 00:08:10.929
 That's the way Naruko thinks it will not be a problem in the mix
