00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.580
 flowering plants reproduce from 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.750
 gendered way this production is done in 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.369
 6 separate steps the steps of the 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.230
 reproduction of a flowering plant 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.000
 located in a cycle one could 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.859
 start to describe the cycle by 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.230
 any step for this 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.880
 presentation we choose from 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:35.070
 start with pollination the gamete 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.380
 male of the flower and and the pollen the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.239
 pollination is when the pollen gets 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.239
 year moves land from the mine state 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:48.210
 towards the stigma of the pistil of another 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.010
 flower there are several agents of 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.770
 pollination for example animals 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.440
 they are insects of the birds 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.770
 or mammals can help the flower 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.270
 carried the wind the wind can also 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.430
 to be a very good pollinator 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:09.659
 pollen is a cell that reaches 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.409
 favorable conditions for 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.189
 lie 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.939
 we can observe under the microscope the pollen 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.939
 which is growing 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.470
 in the presence of sugar 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.729
 on the sigma of pistil pollen 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.250
 meets the favorable conditions for 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.799
 develop 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:36.369
 there he begins to develop 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:38.560
 lengthen along the style until 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:42.069
 they come into contact with an egg 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.229
 to lover the male gamete which is the 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.479
 pollen and the female gamete that ovulates it 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:51.179
 meet in the water towards the 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.179
 flower then we speak of fertilization 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.930
 as the body of a pregnant woman gets 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.420
 transforms the flower transforms more 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:04.780
 to fertilization 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.400
 she begins by losing her petals which 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.000
 are no longer useful for attracting 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.580
 insects then the ovary enlarged for 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.880
 become the fruit the fertilized eggs 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.600
 then become the seeds that's the 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.600
 fructification 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.320
 once the fruit is provided 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.120
 laplante will try to move her away from her 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.340
 indeed if the seeds fall to his 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.380
 feet she may enter several 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.450
 difficulties 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.190
 first she would have to push 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.360
 in the shadow of the mother plant what 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.780
 is not ideal for doing the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.780
 photosynthesis 

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:47.550
 then the mother plant can soil 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.410
 water and minerals 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.920
 these minerals may not be in 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.450
 sufficient quantity for the young plant 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:01.360
 you have to disperse the seeds 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.360
 there are several dispersing agents 

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:08.780
 the animals eat the fruits with the 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:13.519
 grains these can not be 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.800
 digest in the bodies of animals they 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.569
 can carry them far enough and the 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.980
 reject with their excrement on a 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:21.099
 more favorable terrain to their 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.099
 development 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.739
 the wind can allow some 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.950
 seeds and the to be transported very 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.950
 far 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.060
 water is also an agent of 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.150
 dispersal some seeds like the 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.740
 coconuts float in the water this 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.600
 feature allows them to use 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:46.930
 water as a means of transport 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:50.190
 the coconuts can thus pass 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.190
 from one city ​​to another 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.050
 some plants have developed 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:57.310
 strategies to project the seeds 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.020
 this is the case of the horse chestnut that makes 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.840
 explode the fruit so that greece 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:07.420
 can go far at last the human being 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.280
 is the best dispersing agent we 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.370
 transport the seeds and the seedlings 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.480
 in fertile lands that we waters 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.400
 we plant the seeds at 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.550
 distances that allow them to 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:17.550
 develop 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.700
 once the seed and deposited on a 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:22.470
 soil and that conditions are 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.820
 favorable 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:28.710
 the embryo inside I put to himself 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:30.820
 to develop is germination first 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.470
 the embryo start using the 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.230
 reserve of sugar present in the ribs 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:37.450
 he is in this reserve is enough 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.140
 to give sugar the embryo that is not 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:43.660
 not yet ready to photosynthesize 

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:45.820
 very quickly develops itself 

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:49.650
 will develop roots that him 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:52.919
 remove water from the soil 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.840
 as well as one or more stems with 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.610
 leaves that will allow him 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:05:02.280
 to absorb the light energy of the sun 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:04.229
 and the carbon dioxide of their when the 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.210
 plant it's pretty developed from 

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:07.970
 new flowers appear for him 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.330
 to reproduce in turn 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:14.639
 it is lafleur and pagny flowering is 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.729
 ready to breed and the cycle 

00:05:14.639 --> 00:05:16.729
 start again 

00:05:19.969 --> 00:05:22.479
 see you soon
