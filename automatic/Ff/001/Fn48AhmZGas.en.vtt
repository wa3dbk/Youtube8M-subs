 if he showed it to us to see we go to the deposit 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:40.800

 honestly it's a pretty cool helmet 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.330
 to see here this is how it would be in the 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.760
 character the truth is a bit weird 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.350

 skill that almost all helmets 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.380
 they have 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:08.700
 recover energy to overcome they killed the 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:11.100
 same melee uy 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.570

 Vacuum traveler body produces a 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.650
 vital robbery is to say when but it is a 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.650
 contact with him 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.620
 the absorption of energy you will steal the 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.360
 life to the other enemy and let's change 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.030

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.960
 let me see 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.340
 honestly you have like a little face 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.500
 hawk but because of the layer's theme it does not 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.290
 note a lot the layer is for half of 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.940
 the head but good has a pint 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.770
 pretty cool and you see it in profile is 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.110
 like a little if it looks like a hawk 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.520
 let's see it like that better a wow better 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:59.410

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.970
 recover energy to overcome killing 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:02.500
 enemies with grenades were about 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.569
 numbers the skill increases the energy 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.400
 to overcome obtained by ending the 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.610
 vices of the dark this is very good 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.129
 and shipowner shoot a single shot but 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.650
 generates six times more damage and guarantees 

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:18.370
 The advantage of the lock hole 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.770
 that is, the three bullets come together in one 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.139
 and it does six times more damage, this is going 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.840
 to be like a kind of kamehameha 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.180
