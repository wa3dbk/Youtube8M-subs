it's not exactly a rolling ball yet and

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.040 
it's not exactly a rolling ball yet and
it's<00:03:11.440> taken<00:03:11.830> a<00:03:11.860> hell<00:03:12.070> of<00:03:12.100> a<00:03:12.190> lot<00:03:12.340> more<00:03:12.370> effort

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
it's taken a hell of a lot more effort

but<00:03:14.050> I<00:03:14.440> still<00:03:14.920> rather<00:03:15.160> do<00:03:15.490> that<00:03:15.520> than<00:03:15.910> carry

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
but I still rather do that than carry

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.000

all<00:03:17.110> that<00:03:17.170> gear<00:03:17.590> with<00:03:18.340> me<00:03:18.580> so<00:03:19.150> I<00:03:19.620> suppose<00:03:20.620> it's

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
all that gear with me so I suppose it's

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
and I think in that way we'll call it a

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.280 
and I think in that way we'll call it a
