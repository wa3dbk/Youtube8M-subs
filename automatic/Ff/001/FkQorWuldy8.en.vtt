00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
camera but this color is just totally

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.110 
camera but this color is just totally

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
a preview so far of my way you know um

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.779 
a preview so far of my way you know um
it<00:00:55.010> really<00:00:56.010> does<00:00:56.340> show<00:00:56.610> it's<00:00:57.920> of<00:00:58.920> course<00:00:59.520> it's

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
it really does show it's of course it's

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.299 
it really does show it's of course it's
like<00:00:59.940> a<00:00:59.969> aqua<00:01:00.809> green<00:01:01.170> and<00:01:01.500> as<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.129> can<00:01:02.280> see

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
like a aqua green and as you can see

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.250 
like a aqua green and as you can see
it's<00:01:02.579> already<00:01:02.730> getting<00:01:03.090> tangled<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.660> gotta

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
it's already getting tangled I gotta

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.080 
it's already getting tangled I gotta
brush<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.619> out<00:01:04.710> again<00:01:04.979> as<00:01:05.220> I<00:01:05.489> that's<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.880> only

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
brush it out again as I that's the only

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.149 
brush it out again as I that's the only
downside<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:06.720> this<00:01:06.840> so<00:01:07.140> far<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.740> it

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
downside to this so far is that it

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.050 
downside to this so far is that it
tangles<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.720> easy<00:01:10.250> but<00:01:11.250> I'd<00:01:11.670> probably

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
tangles like so easy but I'd probably

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.310 
tangles like so easy but I'd probably
but<00:01:12.890> probably<00:01:13.890> during<00:01:14.340> the<00:01:14.490> photo<00:01:14.850> shoots<00:01:15.320> up

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320
