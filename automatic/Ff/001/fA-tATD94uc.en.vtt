this<00:01:31.300> one<00:01:31.510> here<00:01:31.750> I<00:01:31.869> mean<00:01:32.110> kids<00:01:32.740> can<00:01:32.860> use<00:01:32.979> it<00:01:33.070> but

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
this one here I mean kids can use it but

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.740 
this one here I mean kids can use it but
like<00:01:33.250> she<00:01:33.369> actually<00:01:33.460> techies<00:01:34.000> can<00:01:34.210> also<00:01:34.450> be

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:34.750 
like she actually techies can also be

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.590 
like she actually techies can also be
using<00:01:35.080> it<00:01:35.170> as<00:01:35.290> well<00:01:35.500> I<00:01:35.800> do<00:01:36.670> believe<00:01:36.970> that<00:01:37.119> you

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
using it as well I do believe that you

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.390 
using it as well I do believe that you
know<00:01:37.750> Nintendo<00:01:38.440> actually<00:01:38.770> have<00:01:38.860> tempted<00:01:39.250> this

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
know Nintendo actually have tempted this

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.370 
know Nintendo actually have tempted this
to<00:01:39.580> turn<00:01:39.820> roll<00:01:40.060> onto<00:01:40.270> playing<00:01:40.720> robots<00:01:41.140> in<00:01:41.320> the

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
to turn roll onto playing robots in the

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.600 
to turn roll onto playing robots in the
video<00:01:41.590> games<00:01:41.860> before<00:01:42.690> but<00:01:43.690> I<00:01:44.470> do<00:01:45.070> believe<00:01:45.580> that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
video games before but I do believe that

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.560 
video games before but I do believe that
while<00:01:46.360> we<00:01:46.600> could<00:01:49.020> partner<00:01:50.020> up<00:01:50.140> with<00:01:50.800> you<00:01:51.280> know

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
while we could partner up with you know

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.469 
while we could partner up with you know
gaming<00:01:52.570> companies<00:01:53.020> I<00:01:53.050> could<00:01:53.380> actually

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
gaming companies I could actually

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.920 
gaming companies I could actually
interpret<00:01:56.520> like<00:01:57.520> merge<00:01:57.820> this<00:01:58.090> robots<00:01:58.600> with

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
interpret like merge this robots with

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.719 
interpret like merge this robots with
video<00:01:59.530> gaming<00:01:59.800> systems<00:02:00.280> in<00:02:00.550> the<00:02:00.670> future<00:02:01.060> and

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
video gaming systems in the future and

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:09.600 
video gaming systems in the future and
that's<00:02:03.729> come<00:02:03.910> with<00:02:04.030> instructions<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:08.610> that's

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
that's come with instructions and that's

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.010 
that's come with instructions and that's
basically<00:02:10.060> about<00:02:10.209> it<00:02:10.509> and<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.230> robot<00:02:11.560> itself

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
basically about it and the robot itself

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:35.429 
basically about it and the robot itself
which<00:02:14.020> it's<00:02:14.230> kind<00:02:14.590> of<00:02:14.620> taped<00:02:14.920> in<00:02:15.130> there

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
put a lot of tape in this one yeah I'm

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:14.289 
put a lot of tape in this one yeah I'm
trying<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:55.610> do<00:02:55.670> it<00:02:55.760> slip<00:02:55.970> one<00:02:56.120> hand<00:02:56.420> I<00:03:13.299> also

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
trying to do it slip one hand I also

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:18.520 
trying to do it slip one hand I also
have<00:03:14.540> another<00:03:14.720> thing<00:03:17.019> what<00:03:18.019> the<00:03:18.170> app<00:03:18.319> is

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
have another thing what the app is

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:35.070 
have another thing what the app is
called<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:24.190> and<00:03:25.389> there's<00:03:26.389> a<00:03:26.480> robot

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.960 

it's<00:03:35.770> actually<00:03:36.010> made<00:03:36.130> a<00:03:36.190> plastic<00:03:36.670> I<00:03:36.790> thought

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
it's actually made a plastic I thought

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.210 
it's actually made a plastic I thought
this<00:03:37.120> thing<00:03:37.330> would<00:03:37.480> be<00:03:37.540> a<00:03:37.660> little<00:03:38.440> bit<00:03:38.560> metal

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
this thing would be a little bit metal

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:45.990 
this thing would be a little bit metal
but<00:03:39.370> it's<00:03:39.490> not<00:03:39.940> here<00:03:40.240> and<00:03:44.490> as<00:03:45.490> things<00:03:45.790> are

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
but it's not here and as things are

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.780 
but it's not here and as things are

break from video games and kind of
Robotics<00:06:10.069> here<00:06:10.279> and<00:06:10.520> I<00:06:13.930> do<00:06:14.930> believe<00:06:15.289> that

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:15.319 
Robotics here and I do believe that

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:19.300 
Robotics here and I do believe that
while<00:06:15.770> we<00:06:16.009> could<00:06:16.550> you<00:06:16.819> know<00:06:17.110> into<00:06:18.110> and<00:06:18.319> create

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
while we could you know into and create

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:29.230 
while we could you know into and create
some<00:06:19.639> more<00:06:19.729> apps<00:06:19.969> for<00:06:20.449> it<00:06:20.689> that<00:06:21.080> will<00:06:28.240> they'll

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
some more apps for it that will they'll

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.740 
some more apps for it that will they'll
provide<00:06:29.569> up<00:06:29.810> some<00:06:30.020> more<00:06:30.139> used<00:06:30.319> to<00:06:30.409> it<00:06:30.590> here<00:06:30.830> and

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
provide up some more used to it here and

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:35.559 
provide up some more used to it here and
I<00:06:32.750> think<00:06:32.990> that<00:06:33.229> and<00:06:33.949> we'll<00:06:34.699> see<00:06:34.729> in<00:06:35.270> the<00:06:35.360> future

00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:35.569 
I think that and we'll see in the future

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:39.189 
I think that and we'll see in the future
that<00:06:36.279> we<00:06:37.279> could<00:06:37.490> have<00:06:37.699> this<00:06:37.909> torch<00:06:38.839> the<00:06:38.990> video

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:39.199 
that we could have this torch the video

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:45.819 
that we could have this torch the video
games<00:06:39.500> here<00:06:39.949> and<00:06:41.740> well<00:06:42.740> this<00:06:42.860> is<00:06:42.919> me<00:06:43.159> JD<00:06:43.610> out
