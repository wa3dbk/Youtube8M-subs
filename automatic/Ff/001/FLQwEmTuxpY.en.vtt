00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.530
 hello boys 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:05.960
 my son walked Alex 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.320
 life and all that 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:10.299
 bad life all of them 

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.459
 and today we will discuss the guys 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:13.899
 such question 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:17.099
 hockey for adults 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.050
 yes yes and others I heard like everyone said in unison 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:21.239
 not 

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:23.289
 but in my opinion is planned quite 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.289
 German edition 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.919
 rubles 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.890
 with 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.850
 as you know recently 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.950
 bought the power of law abdrahmanov 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.520
 to cover all public 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.510
 video footage 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.880
 I think that such 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:12.920
 new ones 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.380
 law directly to the meeting post 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:17.540
 for the sake of favorite Soviet 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.270
 wait a minute cheboksary 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.140
 hijacker 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.770
 The Bremen Town Musicians 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.790
 and many others would seem 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.140
 good emotions 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.750
 childhood turned out to be so tough 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.630
 censorship 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:29.970
 what is the authorities 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.070
 What are they needed for 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.300
 nobody looked means 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.600
 in the smallest year 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.119
 in China, children ideas about 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.070
 the world around him is told that 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.390
 many interesting things in this way 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.540
 which adults can't tell because 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.000
 the kids themselves are interesting bright 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.320
 hero 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.850
 story 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.290
 fairytale comrades 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.340
 one obligatory china creative 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.370
 watching my film children understand how 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.100
 do bad and how good however the Ministry of Finance 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.550
 will not only good and evil 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:59.659
 they set aside 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.030
 certain imprint of life 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.590
 the child makes its own contribution to 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.730
 formation only 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:07.730
 as stated on one of the banks on the Internet 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:09.479
 materials dollars 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.049
 we don't lose hope in fact 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.149
 many people still don't 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:16.499
 agreed again that one year she 

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.139
 source said 

00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.139
 and what the censor network wants from us 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:21.799
 everything seems to be okay 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.290
 let's try to figure it out 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.499
 Are these cartoons really kids? 

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.499
 completely non-child worked in doubles 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:34.309
 give a start to look at all this 

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:35.860
 by state centers 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.200
 wolves smoke and break the rules 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.809
 road traffic 

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:42.109
 yes it's propaganda robber image 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:43.059
 of life 

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:44.189
 closing 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:45.640
 logic captured 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.080
 we started working with the church yes it is 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.280
 exploitation of child labor 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.099
 spare parts winnie the pooh 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.089
 steals away from the rabbit 

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:57.199
 on the same day we are not his present 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:59.729
 breakfasts 

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:01.799
 top 100 what 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.549
 don't you think it's all at least 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.900
 absurd and now back to that 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.299
 what do exist 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.439
 cartoon is no secret that we 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.120
 Now we often fictional stories 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.449
 whose main role is played 

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:16.259
 fairytale characters or animals and 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:17.519
 the main goal of the cartoon 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.469
 to tell some instructive 

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:21.789
 story and give the viewer more often 

00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:22.579
 the region 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.009
 correct presentation 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:25.459
 and kinder light 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.869
 as the peace plan wrote on her blog 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:30.319
 sting price increases served show 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.879
 and asked 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.149
 what is good 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:35.939
 what 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.949
 if doing so as a row of our state 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.239
 Caesar lost will not disappear at all 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:42.189
 they want only the account of what gives us 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.619
 idea of ​​the goal because you agree that 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:46.589
 children usually more quickly resemble and 

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:48.530
 repeat bad than good 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.919
 so children are more likely to try 

00:03:50.919 --> 00:03:53.159
 like a wolf out of you wait a minute 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.399
 like a hare 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:56.219
 so our state is he 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.629
 seeks as hard as possible then money 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:00.219
 from advertising and provocation harmful 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:02.699
 habits 

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:04.019
 it is not right 

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:05.489
 and several airplanes 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:06.279
 cartoons 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:08.909
 judging by the print just make fun 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.959
 so for example there is a booth or 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.449
 to please his clubs 

00:04:13.449 --> 00:04:14.909
 he explains he 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:16.959
 can not be shown or even japan 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.209
 Well, let's say the racers have now banned your 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.680
 children and Georgians from the negative from the screen 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.060
 there is no reality show hidden 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.530
 stupid things while continue 

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.330
 be investigated on television during the day 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.139
 time 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.259
 For example 

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.860
 in house 2 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:31.800
 brothers 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.310
 certainly a set of indecent 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.449
 terms 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.909
 promotion of free relations 

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:38.199
 and now 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.389
 comedy club 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.389
 France Press 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.270
 I understand the nature of the match why the decree 4 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:51.279
 2 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:53.749
 Then those who have time to lumber have thought 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:56.749
 reportedly 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.409
 moral 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:08.409
 couple secretly selling for 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:13.540
 the old 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:15.479
 but 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:18.289
 to relatives 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.249
 right away 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:22.589
 so here to work since they were so 

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:23.340
 will stay 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.559
 and nobody canceled them 

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:26.039
 just limited the age of children 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:28.139
 I admit that after watching 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.400
 which allows parents once again 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:32.370
 to consider whether children should look like 

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.180
 calculation of wolves and yesterday is still very good and 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.139
 personally doing nothing Bremen 

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:37.879
 musicians 

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.789
 in the end you can just explain 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:41.080
 to your child after watching 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.999
 cartoon such a hero was 

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.770
 positive 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:45.059
 what deny 

00:05:45.059 --> 00:05:47.300
 In short, I personally think we value 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.879
 for children gathering views 

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:52.169
 and instructive stories 

00:05:52.169 --> 00:05:53.840
 but the cake should be carefully 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.879
 relate to what your child is watching 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:57.069
 among all cartoons 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.560
 really it would be worth it 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.110
 to ban 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.369
 to show children under 18 

00:06:02.369 --> 00:06:05.300
 or better to twenty one 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.430
 sign up to start a light visit 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.199
 The following issue and I have already examined 

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:13.199
 it's bright 

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:18.349
 yes gamba for the second time 

00:06:18.349 --> 00:06:19.629
 it's not a secret to anyone 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:22.129
 Now we often fictional stories 

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:24.439
 with characters who are fabulous 

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:27.529
 characters 

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:28.530
 did 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.850
 vocal instrumental 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.850
 ensemble two periods 

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:46.479
 2
