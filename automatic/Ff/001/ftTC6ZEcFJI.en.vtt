00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
 so people to finish the video 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.500
 target is the five worst readings I 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:12.420
 I had it in 2013, right? 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:14.130
 are so famous but not even 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.070
 agree with me 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.690
 without agreeing that I like it is mine but it's 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.150
 I did not mean to speak the worst lived by 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.250
 which are not the worst but are those 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.420
 which did not please me at all. 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.789
 I live a little 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.779
 the first one is the book of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.780
 jacques 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:36.890
 it is for this book and the library unb 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:49.350
 is a book and afternoon talks on a 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:01:03.210
 arrested and he runs away with money 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:05.519
 the movie one night unhappy happy same 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.810
 because I'm doing it well 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:25.799
 funny 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:31.650
 hans cinema tells the story of a 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:35.360
 of the 32 to end up by chance was 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:49.470
 fleeing there bumping into jesus is 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:53.610
 Finally, remember my life that is equal to 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.219
 what a difference it is more the same 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:02.969
 more or less this book when it was 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:05.100
 newest book but it was not the case 

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.979
 thirdly here is a book that 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.229
 turned film and also Jorge that with the 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.790
 Your Eastwick Witches, huh? 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.960
 the witches here then only with a cloth of 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.390
 background the story about 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.620
 women are satisfied with life 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.640
 daily life that are leading 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.980
 cidadizinha called hippie style and 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.000
 a lot of race in history is narrated by 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.400
 women 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.010
 so it was from them that crisis of 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.280
 middle age so I guess this is more 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.740
 An excuse to speak witches, right? 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.480
 talking about it gives her credibility 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.290
 that appears a guy who is from the city 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.940
 that in the movie is jack nicolson and the three 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.220
 fall in love with him 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:45.840
 speaking in English was already very 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.720
 I took so long to finish reading 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:51.540
 to speak the truth, little is needed 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.800
 here to finish already consider the 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.560
 owners of the houses and everything I had 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.420
 This year 2013 is not 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.160
 I hope the movie is better than it did 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.820
 when you finish reading pounds in the 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.440
 last 40 pages for my movie to say 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.630
 What a cache, so make a conclusion. 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.890
 You will not be afraid of him. 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.480
 next year is unlikely and so will 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.760
 therefore attack blacklisted 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.710
 Imagine but said that torture teaching 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.580
 is in second place on my list of 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:22.740
 worst readings I did in 2013 to him 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:36.180
 Order water 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:04:02.220
 I have this book, I order it by 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:04:10.320
 main character falling but it is a 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:12.150
 thing that you might want to read a 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:14.540
 book and having fun this kind of 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:20.010
 fun you like but I did not like it 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:24.960
 No one liked me, because the 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.650
 sometimes books and will see something different 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.060
 finally 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.889
 Let's go anywhere I had 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:30.810
 law and in 2013 was actually a book 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:34.080
 I started in 2012 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.270
 spent almost four times a book 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.660
 including that many people like it 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.810
 listening I found it horrible that the bombs 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.850
 They played the first book here. It's a book. 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.570
 very drawn characters very 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.850
 boring 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:50.460
 women telling the story is this 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:54.300
 their perspective in this case I do not 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.660
 I liked not liking the book because I am 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.470
 the man but it is I realized that the public 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:06.030
 You'll like this book because I think 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:08.280
 that a woman who has also come here 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:11.220
 that women understand better than the 

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.289
 men are not only in the macho 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.440
 some small where really none 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:29.340
 The intention I have to say is 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:45.320
 very boring so far I know the 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:45.320
 series continue without knowing of worse 

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:59.690
 likes and goes there 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:03.180
 Anyway, I like or dislike talking about it. 

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:04.349
 disagree with me, I like to listen 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.669
 in this school that someone likes 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:11.880
 chocolate but finally spoke of 

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:14.880
 opinions commit is and until the next video 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.260
 has a good year and until next year is 

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:18.260
 easy enough everyone there
