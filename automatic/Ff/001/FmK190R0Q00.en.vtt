going<00:02:20.880> to<00:02:20.940> get<00:02:21.090> more<00:02:21.270> stats<00:02:21.620> base<00:02:22.620> stats<00:02:22.950> for

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
going to get more stats base stats for

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.780 
going to get more stats base stats for
fielding<00:02:24.740> catching<00:02:25.740> pot<00:02:25.920> fires<00:02:26.190> that<00:02:26.459> sort<00:02:26.730> of

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
fielding catching pot fires that sort of

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.470 
fielding catching pot fires that sort of
thing<00:02:26.849> so<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:28.260> enjoy<00:02:29.160> the<00:02:29.340> hitting<00:02:29.580> part<00:02:29.849> most

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
thing so I enjoy the hitting part most

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.729 
thing so I enjoy the hitting part most
of<00:02:30.629> time<00:02:30.780> especially<00:02:31.019> if<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.590> watch<00:02:31.709> my

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
of time especially if you watch my

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.110 
of time especially if you watch my
videos<00:02:31.920> you're<00:02:32.400> going<00:02:32.519> to<00:02:32.579> see<00:02:32.730> that<00:02:32.909> I<00:02:32.939> don't

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
videos you're going to see that I don't

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.280 
videos you're going to see that I don't
really<00:02:33.269> play<00:02:33.510> defense<00:02:33.989> you<00:02:34.769> can<00:02:35.250> have

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
really play defense you can have

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:37.809 
really play defense you can have
where<00:02:36.439> it<00:02:36.530> automatically<00:02:37.099> do<00:02:37.250> defense<00:02:37.700> a

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
where it automatically do defense a

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:40.300 
where it automatically do defense a
place<00:02:38.030> for<00:02:38.329> you<00:02:38.620> as<00:02:39.620> far<00:02:39.829> as<00:02:39.950> hitting<00:02:40.129> is

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
place for you as far as hitting is

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.860 
place for you as far as hitting is
concerned<00:02:40.640> in<00:02:40.730> this<00:02:40.790> game<00:02:41.060> they've<00:02:41.629> made<00:02:41.840> a

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
concerned in this game they've made a

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.470 
concerned in this game they've made a
couple<00:02:42.109> improvements<00:02:43.150> the<00:02:44.150> biggest

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
couple improvements the biggest

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.119 
couple improvements the biggest
improvement<00:02:44.930> obviously<00:02:45.409> is<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.739> analog

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
improvement obviously is the analog

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:49.599 
improvement obviously is the analog
heading<00:02:46.900> in<00:02:47.900> previous<00:02:48.769> versions<00:02:49.099> of<00:02:49.459> this

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:49.609 
heading in previous versions of this

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:51.729 
heading in previous versions of this
game<00:02:49.909> you<00:02:50.390> would<00:02:50.540> hit<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:51.049> was<00:02:51.200> all<00:02:51.319> based<00:02:51.500> on

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
game you would hit it was all based on

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.369 
game you would hit it was all based on
timing<00:02:52.129> and<00:02:52.489> location<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.239> pitch<00:02:53.450> so

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 
timing and location of the pitch so

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.199 
timing and location of the pitch so
basically<00:02:54.709> to<00:02:54.920> hit<00:02:55.129> you<00:02:55.430> pull<00:02:55.730> the<00:02:55.970> right

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
basically to hit you pull the right

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.319 
basically to hit you pull the right
analog<00:02:56.540> stick<00:02:56.659> down<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:58.340> get<00:02:58.670> your<00:02:58.790> backswing

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 
analog stick down to get your backswing

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:01.899 
analog stick down to get your backswing
and<00:02:59.540> then<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.439> push<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.129> forward<00:03:01.340> to<00:03:01.790> you

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
and then you push it forward to you

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.759 
and then you push it forward to you
follow<00:03:02.239> through<00:03:02.510> on<00:03:02.599> your<00:03:02.810> swing<00:03:03.200> so

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
follow through on your swing so

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.410 
follow through on your swing so
basically<00:03:04.069> like<00:03:04.310> Tiger<00:03:04.639> Woods<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:05.000> pull<00:03:05.269> the

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
basically like Tiger Woods you pull the

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.660 
basically like Tiger Woods you pull the
stick<00:03:05.659> back<00:03:05.689> to<00:03:06.139> pull<00:03:06.709> your<00:03:06.859> club<00:03:07.129> back<00:03:07.159> and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
stick back to pull your club back and

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.759 
stick back to pull your club back and
then<00:03:07.790> push<00:03:08.060> it<00:03:08.090> forward<00:03:08.420> to<00:03:08.810> you<00:03:08.870> hit<00:03:09.470> the<00:03:09.620> ball

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
then push it forward to you hit the ball

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.330 
then push it forward to you hit the ball
so<00:03:10.400> it's<00:03:10.519> the<00:03:10.609> same<00:03:10.639> idea<00:03:11.329> in<00:03:11.389> MLB<00:03:12.079> but<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:13.189> big

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
so it's the same idea in MLB but the big

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.050 
so it's the same idea in MLB but the big
key<00:03:13.790> is<00:03:14.060> your<00:03:14.599> timing<00:03:14.900> so<00:03:15.819> knowing<00:03:16.819> when<00:03:17.030> the

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
key is your timing so knowing when the

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.550 
key is your timing so knowing when the
pitch<00:03:17.359> is<00:03:17.510> going<00:03:17.659> to<00:03:17.720> be<00:03:17.840> across<00:03:18.109> the<00:03:18.319> plate

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
pitch is going to be across the plate

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.349 
pitch is going to be across the plate
when<00:03:18.859> you're<00:03:18.980> doing<00:03:19.849> your<00:03:19.879> follow-through

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
when you're doing your follow-through

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:23.830 
when you're doing your follow-through
and<00:03:20.980> I<00:03:21.980> really<00:03:22.220> like<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.579> it's<00:03:23.329> more

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
and I really like it it's more

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.649 
and I really like it it's more
challenging<00:03:24.139> at<00:03:24.859> first<00:03:24.919> but<00:03:25.669> once<00:03:26.389> you<00:03:26.540> get

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
challenging at first but once you get

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.659 
challenging at first but once you get
used<00:03:26.900> to<00:03:26.989> it<00:03:27.079> it's<00:03:27.349> so<00:03:27.829> much<00:03:27.980> more<00:03:28.129> natural

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:28.669 
used to it it's so much more natural

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.089 
used to it it's so much more natural
than<00:03:28.819> just<00:03:29.120> pushing<00:03:29.329> a<00:03:29.540> button<00:03:29.739> okay<00:03:30.739> before<00:03:30.889> I

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
than just pushing a button okay before I

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:32.530 
than just pushing a button okay before I

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:52.609 
first thing is a guest pitch so with

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.589 
first thing is a guest pitch so with
this<00:03:52.639> setting<00:03:53.120> I<00:03:53.359> always<00:03:53.750> go<00:03:53.989> with<00:03:54.139> quarter

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:55.599 
this setting I always go with quarter

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.009 
this setting I always go with quarter
you<00:03:56.599> get<00:03:56.750> the<00:03:56.870> less<00:03:57.109> amount<00:03:57.440> of<00:03:58.870> benefit<00:03:59.870> from

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
you get the less amount of benefit from

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:02.589 
you get the less amount of benefit from
picking<00:04:00.440> the<00:04:00.650> pitch<00:04:00.829> correctly<00:04:01.489> but<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:02.449> me

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 
picking the pitch correctly but to me

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.050 
picking the pitch correctly but to me
it's<00:04:03.109> more<00:04:03.590> important<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:04.459> note<00:04:04.579> where<00:04:04.940> the

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
it's more important to note where the

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.300 
it's more important to note where the
pitch<00:04:05.209> is<00:04:05.239> going<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.569> be<00:04:05.949> over<00:04:06.949> getting<00:04:07.220> a

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
pitch is going to be over getting a

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.939 
pitch is going to be over getting a
slight<00:04:07.579> boost<00:04:07.790> in<00:04:08.090> you<00:04:08.989> know<00:04:09.109> contact<00:04:09.680> or

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:09.949 
slight boost in you know contact or

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.089 
slight boost in you know contact or
power<00:04:10.639> so<00:04:11.629> I<00:04:11.659> go<00:04:12.109> with<00:04:12.260> quarter<00:04:12.590> and<00:04:12.799> I'll<00:04:12.889> show

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:13.099 
power so I go with quarter and I'll show

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.069 
power so I go with quarter and I'll show
you<00:04:13.129> what<00:04:13.970> this<00:04:14.120> means<00:04:14.180> in<00:04:14.599> just<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.810> couple<00:04:14.930> of

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
you what this means in just a couple of

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.699 
you what this means in just a couple of
minutes<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:17.479> next<00:04:17.810> thing<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:18.229> like<00:04:18.470> is<00:04:18.500> the

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
minutes the next thing I like is the

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:20.680 
minutes the next thing I like is the
hitting<00:04:19.190> view<00:04:19.340> I<00:04:19.400> change<00:04:19.789> to<00:04:20.000> catch<00:04:20.209> or<00:04:20.359> three

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
hitting view I change to catch or three

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.719 
hitting view I change to catch or three
and<00:04:21.139> what<00:04:21.500> this<00:04:21.650> does<00:04:21.709> is<00:04:22.039> it<00:04:22.099> kind<00:04:22.370> of<00:04:22.430> moves<00:04:22.550> a

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:22.729 
and what this does is it kind of moves a

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:24.580 
and what this does is it kind of moves a
camera<00:04:23.060> down<00:04:23.090> so<00:04:23.630> it's<00:04:23.750> pointing<00:04:24.440> in<00:04:24.530> the

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
camera down so it's pointing in the

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.370 
camera down so it's pointing in the
center<00:04:24.949> of<00:04:24.979> the<00:04:25.159> zone<00:04:25.400> so<00:04:26.330> it's<00:04:26.900> a<00:04:27.229> little

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
center of the zone so it's a little

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.140 
center of the zone so it's a little
easier<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:27.979> determine<00:04:28.370> if<00:04:28.699> the<00:04:28.820> pitch<00:04:29.000> is

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
easier to determine if the pitch is

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.480 
easier to determine if the pitch is
going<00:04:29.240> to<00:04:29.360> be<00:04:29.479> higher<00:04:29.750> low<00:04:30.080> because<00:04:30.830> of<00:04:31.070> your

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
going to be higher low because of your

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.310 
going to be higher low because of your
field<00:04:31.729> of<00:04:31.909> views<00:04:32.120> a<00:04:32.180> little<00:04:32.479> bit<00:04:32.599> better<00:04:32.810> so

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
field of views a little bit better so

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.969 
field of views a little bit better so
the<00:04:34.250> normal<00:04:34.490> pit<00:04:34.900> stances<00:04:35.900> like<00:04:36.110> up<00:04:36.380> above<00:04:36.770> the

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
the normal pit stances like up above the

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:39.189 
the normal pit stances like up above the
cut<00:04:37.159> your<00:04:37.340> kinda<00:04:37.699> so<00:04:38.330> it's<00:04:38.720> hard<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:38.960> tell

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
cut your kinda so it's hard to tell

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:40.600 
cut your kinda so it's hard to tell
really<00:04:39.380> if<00:04:39.590> a<00:04:39.740> pitch<00:04:39.919> is<00:04:40.039> going<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.280> be<00:04:40.370> higher

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
really if a pitch is going to be higher

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:41.950 
really if a pitch is going to be higher
if<00:04:40.909> it's<00:04:41.060> going<00:04:41.180> to<00:04:41.240> come<00:04:41.419> in<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.690> strike<00:04:41.930> zone

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
if it's going to come in the strike zone

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.779 
if it's going to come in the strike zone
because<00:04:42.470> you're<00:04:42.590> kind<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:42.800> looking<00:04:42.949> down<00:04:43.400> at

00:04:43.779 --> 00:04:43.789 
because you're kind of looking down at

00:04:43.789 --> 00:04:47.480 
because you're kind of looking down at
the<00:04:44.389> plate<00:04:44.630> more<00:04:45.139> compared<00:04:45.950> to<00:04:46.070> catcher<00:04:46.250> three

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
the plate more compared to catcher three

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.650 
the plate more compared to catcher three
okay<00:04:48.490> so<00:04:48.550> here<00:04:48.790> we<00:04:48.910> are<00:04:49.030> at<00:04:49.120> bet<00:04:49.300> so<00:04:49.510> let's

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:49.660 
okay so here we are at bet so let's

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.540 
okay so here we are at bet so let's
really<00:04:49.870> see<00:04:50.050> what<00:04:50.170> that<00:04:50.290> quarter<00:04:50.740> pitch<00:04:51.310> zone

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
really see what that quarter pitch zone

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.510 
really see what that quarter pitch zone
really<00:04:51.820> looks<00:04:52.030> like<00:04:52.140> so<00:04:53.140> as<00:04:53.440> you<00:04:53.470> can<00:04:53.620> see<00:04:53.890> you

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
really looks like so as you can see you

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.510 
really looks like so as you can see you
can<00:04:54.730> choose<00:04:55.530> basically<00:04:56.530> all<00:04:56.560> four<00:04:57.070> corners<00:04:57.340> in

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
can choose basically all four corners in

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.920 
can choose basically all four corners in
the<00:04:57.610> plate<00:04:57.820> so<00:04:58.000> you<00:04:58.120> can<00:04:58.270> check<00:04:58.450> to<00:04:58.600> see<00:04:58.630> if<00:04:58.810> the

00:04:58.920 --> 00:04:58.930 
the plate so you can check to see if the

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.200 
the plate so you can check to see if the
ball<00:04:59.140> is<00:04:59.170> going<00:04:59.290> to<00:04:59.380> be<00:04:59.470> outside<00:04:59.800> inside<00:05:00.310> high

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
ball is going to be outside inside high

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.870 
ball is going to be outside inside high
or<00:05:01.270> low<00:05:01.680> Leo<00:05:02.680> I<00:05:02.800> kind<00:05:03.130> of<00:05:03.220> incorporate<00:05:03.730> the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
or low Leo I kind of incorporate the

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:05.520 
or low Leo I kind of incorporate the
middle<00:05:04.150> of<00:05:04.180> this<00:05:04.360> middle<00:05:04.960> of<00:05:05.020> the<00:05:05.080> plate<00:05:05.200> so

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:05.530 
middle of this middle of the plate so

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:08.370 
middle of this middle of the plate so
your<00:05:05.710> except<00:05:06.100> there<00:05:06.310> so<00:05:07.300> what<00:05:07.810> I<00:05:07.840> like<00:05:08.080> to<00:05:08.110> do

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380 
your except there so what I like to do

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.520 
your except there so what I like to do
is<00:05:08.770> pick<00:05:09.040> down<00:05:09.340> in<00:05:09.490> the<00:05:09.580> zone<00:05:09.610> for<00:05:10.030> me<00:05:10.720> I<00:05:11.050> I'm<00:05:11.470> a

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
is pick down in the zone for me I I'm a

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.710 
is pick down in the zone for me I I'm a
power<00:05:11.860> hitter<00:05:12.100> so<00:05:12.640> a<00:05:12.970> lot<00:05:13.210> of<00:05:13.240> times<00:05:13.510> you're

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:13.720 
power hitter so a lot of times you're

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.480 
power hitter so a lot of times you're
going<00:05:13.870> to<00:05:13.930> see<00:05:14.140> pitches<00:05:14.560> down<00:05:14.740> the<00:05:15.010> zone<00:05:15.220> to

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
going to see pitches down the zone to

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.810 
going to see pitches down the zone to
try<00:05:15.610> to<00:05:15.700> get<00:05:15.880> you<00:05:15.970> to<00:05:16.000> ground<00:05:16.660> out<00:05:17.460> so<00:05:18.460> I<00:05:18.490> always

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
try to get you to ground out so I always

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.030 
try to get you to ground out so I always
pick<00:05:19.120> down<00:05:19.300> the<00:05:19.480> zone<00:05:19.660> I<00:05:19.870> also<00:05:20.350> always<00:05:20.650> pick

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.040 
pick down the zone I also always pick

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.220 
pick down the zone I also always pick
the<00:05:21.070> pitch<00:05:21.880> that's<00:05:22.150> the<00:05:22.270> x<00:05:22.480> button<00:05:22.750> which

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:23.230 
the pitch that's the x button which

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.710 
the pitch that's the x button which
typically<00:05:23.770> is<00:05:23.920> a<00:05:24.100> four-seam<00:05:24.820> fastball<00:05:25.420> or

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
typically is a four-seam fastball or

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.290 
typically is a four-seam fastball or
whatever<00:05:26.620> their<00:05:26.860> flavor<00:05:27.220> fastball<00:05:27.850> is<00:05:28.060> most

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 
whatever their flavor fastball is most

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.970 
whatever their flavor fastball is most
pictures<00:05:29.200> you're<00:05:29.320> going<00:05:29.440> to<00:05:29.500> see<00:05:29.710> have

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
pictures you're going to see have

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.250 
pictures you're going to see have
typically<00:05:30.880> one<00:05:31.180> fastball<00:05:31.720> but<00:05:32.020> there<00:05:32.170> are

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
typically one fastball but there are

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.110 
typically one fastball but there are
some<00:05:32.470> that<00:05:32.650> have<00:05:32.800> multiple<00:05:33.130> fastball<00:05:33.730> so<00:05:34.030> you

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:34.120 
some that have multiple fastball so you

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.540 
some that have multiple fastball so you
have<00:05:34.210> to<00:05:34.330> just<00:05:34.480> be<00:05:34.630> careful<00:05:35.020> with<00:05:35.170> that<00:05:35.310> but<00:05:36.310> I

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
have to just be careful with that but I

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:38.160 
have to just be careful with that but I
like<00:05:36.730> to<00:05:36.760> pick<00:05:36.970> fastball<00:05:37.750> all<00:05:37.870> the<00:05:37.900> time

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170 
like to pick fastball all the time

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.170 
like to pick fastball all the time
because<00:05:38.380> one<00:05:39.250> it's<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.610> fastest<00:05:40.000> pitch

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
because one it's the fastest pitch

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.660 
because one it's the fastest pitch
obviously<00:05:40.810> so<00:05:41.110> your<00:05:41.920> timing<00:05:42.220> has<00:05:42.490> to<00:05:42.520> be

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:42.670 
obviously so your timing has to be

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:47.220 
obviously so your timing has to be
quicker<00:05:43.030> so<00:05:43.840> if<00:05:44.350> I<00:05:44.680> know<00:05:45.000> if<00:05:46.000> I<00:05:46.300> pick<00:05:46.630> fastball

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
quicker so if I know if I pick fastball

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.070 
quicker so if I know if I pick fastball
I<00:05:47.560> have<00:05:48.100> to<00:05:48.310> be<00:05:48.640> ready<00:05:48.790> to<00:05:49.060> swing<00:05:49.300> faster<00:05:49.630> than

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
I have to be ready to swing faster than

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.410 
I have to be ready to swing faster than
if<00:05:50.350> I<00:05:50.620> pick<00:05:50.860> something<00:05:51.310> else<00:05:51.430> so<00:05:52.180> I<00:05:52.210> always

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
if I pick something else so I always

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.630 
if I pick something else so I always
pick<00:05:52.660> fastball<00:05:53.170> typically<00:05:54.130> all<00:05:54.370> the<00:05:54.490> other

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:54.640 
pick fastball typically all the other

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:09.490 
obviously this is still the first inning

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:11.310 
obviously this is still the first inning
so<00:06:09.760> there's<00:06:10.270> not<00:06:10.390> a<00:06:10.450> whole<00:06:10.600> lot<00:06:10.660> of<00:06:10.780> data<00:06:11.020> here

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
so there's not a whole lot of data here

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:13.890 
so there's not a whole lot of data here
but<00:06:11.830> the<00:06:11.950> key<00:06:12.130> one<00:06:12.310> is<00:06:12.460> balls<00:06:12.700> and<00:06:12.910> strikes<00:06:13.180> so

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
away from swinging especially at the

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.530 
away from swinging especially at the
first<00:06:29.290> pitch<00:06:29.500> unless<00:06:30.190> obviously<00:06:31.000> I<00:06:31.030> picked<00:06:31.450> a

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540 
first pitch unless obviously I picked a

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.170 
first pitch unless obviously I picked a
correct<00:06:31.810> pitch<00:06:31.990> and<00:06:32.230> it's<00:06:32.350> a<00:06:32.440> good<00:06:32.590> one<00:06:32.740> to<00:06:32.890> hit

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
correct pitch and it's a good one to hit

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.070 
correct pitch and it's a good one to hit
