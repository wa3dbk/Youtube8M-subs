00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.770 
strong and he could jump really high and
run<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.400> know<00:01:41.520> 60<00:01:42.119> miles<00:01:42.299> an<00:01:42.479> hour<00:01:42.570> or

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
run and you know 60 miles an hour or

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.280 
run and you know 60 miles an hour or
whatever<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.500> he<00:01:44.340> fought<00:01:44.670> Bigfoot<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.840> then

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
whatever and he fought Bigfoot and then

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.130 
whatever and he fought Bigfoot and then
it<00:01:46.409> turned<00:01:46.619> out<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.149> don't<00:01:48.149> even<00:01:48.360> remember<00:01:48.540> why

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
it turned out I don't even remember why

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.830 
it turned out I don't even remember why
it<00:01:49.170> did<00:01:49.619> what<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.700> storyline<00:01:51.000> was<00:01:51.180> but<00:01:51.509> that

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
it did what the storyline was but that

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.700 
it did what the storyline was but that
Bigfoot<00:01:52.380> was<00:01:52.560> Bionic<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:53.759> maybe<00:01:54.149> if<00:01:54.710> life

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
Bigfoot was Bionic so maybe if life

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.810 
Bigfoot was Bionic so maybe if life
imitates<00:01:56.219> art<00:01:56.310> Bigfoot<00:01:57.060> is<00:01:57.149> actually<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.659> robot

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
imitates art Bigfoot is actually a robot

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.580 
imitates art Bigfoot is actually a robot
now<00:01:59.820> so<00:02:00.180> you<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:00.719> think<00:02:01.049> Bigfoot's<00:02:01.500> a

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
now so you really think Bigfoot's a

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.859 
now so you really think Bigfoot's a
robot<00:02:02.009> not<00:02:02.250> even<00:02:02.579> remotely<00:02:02.939> close<00:02:03.390> so<00:02:03.750> you

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
robot not even remotely close so you

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:07.340 
robot not even remotely close so you
think<00:02:04.110> maybe<00:02:05.630> somebody's<00:02:06.630> got<00:02:06.780> a<00:02:06.810> controller

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
think maybe somebody's got a controller

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.320 
think maybe somebody's got a controller
and<00:02:07.680> they're<00:02:07.770> just<00:02:07.979> what<00:02:08.580> having<00:02:08.970> Bigfoot

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
and they're just what having Bigfoot

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.309 
and they're just what having Bigfoot
walk<00:02:09.569> around<00:02:09.899> the

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
walk around the

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:12.020 
walk around the
controller<00:02:10.799> no<00:02:11.219> I<00:02:11.249> don't<00:02:11.519> I<00:02:11.849> don't<00:02:11.909> think

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
controller no I don't I don't think

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.910 
controller no I don't I don't think
that's<00:02:12.269> even<00:02:12.510> remotely<00:02:12.540> true<00:02:13.170> but<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.379> do<00:02:13.469> think

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
that's even remotely true but I do think

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.520 
that's even remotely true but I do think
that<00:02:13.980> people<00:02:14.219> will<00:02:14.519> eventually<00:02:14.730> start<00:02:15.689> using

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
that people will eventually start using

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.879 
that people will eventually start using
genetics<00:02:17.219> genetic<00:02:17.999> engineering<00:02:18.389> to<00:02:18.859> create<00:02:19.859> a

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:19.889 
genetics genetic engineering to create a

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.030 
genetics genetic engineering to create a
create<00:02:20.609> a<00:02:20.790> big<00:02:21.420> for<00:02:21.599> this<00:02:21.719> beyond<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:22.889> ones

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
create a big for this beyond the ones

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.280 
create a big for this beyond the ones
you<00:02:23.189> see<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.670> photo<00:02:24.120> ground<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.840> Bigfoot

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:25.290 
you see in the photo ground a Bigfoot

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.319 
you see in the photo ground a Bigfoot
this<00:02:25.859> well<00:02:26.540> born<00:02:27.540> now<00:02:28.290> not<00:02:28.769> not<00:02:29.159> evolved<00:02:30.150> over

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:30.329 
this well born now not not evolved over

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.780 
this well born now not not evolved over
the<00:02:30.389> past<00:02:30.629> you<00:02:30.959> know<00:02:31.079> why<00:02:31.349> are<00:02:31.409> they<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:32.609> have<00:02:32.760> a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the past you know why are they to have a

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.270 
the past you know why are they to have a
weapon<00:02:33.239> no<00:02:34.049> just<00:02:34.379> because<00:02:34.530> why<00:02:34.859> do<00:02:34.920> people

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
weapon no just because why do people

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.830 
weapon no just because why do people
create<00:02:35.519> viruses<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.209> computers<00:02:36.689> the<00:02:36.810> same

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
create viruses on computers the same

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.110 
create viruses on computers the same
thing<00:02:37.349> just<00:02:37.560> either<00:02:38.340> because<00:02:38.669> they're<00:02:38.819> super

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
thing just either because they're super

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.789 
thing just either because they're super
