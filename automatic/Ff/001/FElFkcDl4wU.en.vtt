anyway let's go ahead and look at what

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.830 
anyway let's go ahead and look at what
it<00:01:22.229> does<00:01:22.409> if<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.740> shoot<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> on<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.430> ground

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
it does if you shoot it on the ground

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.450 
it does if you shoot it on the ground
you'll<00:01:24.840> notice<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.470> bounces<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.070> certain

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
you'll notice that it bounces a certain

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.670 
you'll notice that it bounces a certain
distance<00:01:26.850> before<00:01:27.140> splitting<00:01:28.140> into<00:01:28.409> five

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
distance before splitting into five

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.649 
distance before splitting into five
different<00:01:28.890> pellets<00:01:29.369> which<00:01:30.000> all<00:01:30.210> carry<00:01:30.479> the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
different pellets which all carry the

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.350 
different pellets which all carry the
same<00:01:30.869> damage<00:01:31.200> as<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.829> first<00:01:32.070> pellet<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.150> if<00:01:33.270> I

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
same damage as the first pellet so if I

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.969 
same damage as the first pellet so if I
shoot<00:01:33.570> it<00:01:33.689> against<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.049> wall<00:01:34.229> here<00:01:34.530> hopefully

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
shoot it against the wall here hopefully

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.240 
shoot it against the wall here hopefully
you'll<00:01:35.159> see<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.820> distance<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.450> jumps<00:01:36.750> up<00:01:37.250> see

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
you'll see the distance it jumps up see

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.850 
you'll see the distance it jumps up see
I<00:01:38.520> shot<00:01:38.909> here<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.450> it<00:01:39.689> jumped<00:01:40.049> to<00:01:40.170> about<00:01:40.530> there

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
I shot here and it jumped to about there

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.710 
I shot here and it jumped to about there
before<00:01:41.520> splitting<00:01:41.790> into<00:01:42.150> five<00:01:44.060> again<00:01:45.060> we're

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
before splitting into five again we're

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.240 
before splitting into five again we're
going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.899> shoot<00:01:46.110> about<00:01:46.590> right<00:01:46.829> here

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
going to shoot about right here

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.520 
going to shoot about right here
it's<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.240> jump<00:01:48.479> up<00:01:48.689> this<00:01:48.930> high<00:01:49.170> before

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
it's going to jump up this high before

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.249 
it's going to jump up this high before
splitting<00:01:49.979> into<00:01:50.220> five<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:51.270> distance<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:52.110> it

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
splitting into five the distance that it

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.280 
splitting into five the distance that it
jumps<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.860> dependent<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.579> your<00:01:53.670> velocity

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:54.290 
jumps is dependent on your velocity

jumps is dependent on your velocity
skill<00:01:55.290> count<00:01:55.560> so<00:01:56.189> I'm<00:01:56.340> going<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.549> put<00:01:56.670> one

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
skill count so I'm going to put one

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:58.429 
skill count so I'm going to put one
point<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.270> velocity<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:57.930> show<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.409> how

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
point in velocity and show you all how

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.830 
point in velocity and show you all how
that<00:01:58.770> changes<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.340> you<00:02:00.060> can<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.689> with

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
that changes it you can see this is with

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.899 
that changes it you can see this is with
zero<00:02:01.140> velocity<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.950> this<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.280> with<00:02:02.399> one<00:02:02.640> point

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
zero velocity and this is with one point

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.170 
zero velocity and this is with one point
you've<00:02:03.030> lost

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
you've lost

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.310 
you've lost
already<00:02:05.080> uh<00:02:05.170> the<00:02:05.950> jump<00:02:06.670> before<00:02:07.480> the<00:02:07.780> pellets

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
already uh the jump before the pellets

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.730 
already uh the jump before the pellets
flower<00:02:08.619> out<00:02:08.920> has<00:02:09.280> gotten<00:02:09.640> bigger

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
flower out has gotten bigger

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.350 
flower out has gotten bigger
this<00:02:11.740> makes<00:02:11.980> velocity<00:02:12.580> very<00:02:12.820> important<00:02:13.300> to

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
this makes velocity very important to

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.150 
this makes velocity very important to
keep<00:02:13.510> an<00:02:13.660> eye<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:13.960> when<00:02:14.410> you're<00:02:14.620> using<00:02:14.890> the

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
keep an eye on when you're using the

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.640 
keep an eye on when you're using the
pepper<00:02:15.400> dela<00:02:16.320> especially<00:02:17.320> if<00:02:17.410> you<00:02:17.500> have<00:02:17.620> a

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
special things about the Pimpernel is

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.630 
special things about the Pimpernel is
how<00:02:23.080> it<00:02:23.320> interacts<00:02:23.740> with<00:02:23.860> the<00:02:23.980> scale<00:02:24.310> bore

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
how it interacts with the scale bore

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.850 
how it interacts with the scale bore
your<00:02:25.480> shots<00:02:25.720> pierce<00:02:26.050> through<00:02:26.260> enemies<00:02:26.350> if

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
your shots pierce through enemies if

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:28.920 
your shots pierce through enemies if
your<00:02:26.980> shots<00:02:27.220> hit<00:02:27.550> an<00:02:27.730> enemy<00:02:27.910> after<00:02:28.270> piercing

your shots hit an enemy after piercing
it<00:02:29.050> at<00:02:29.140> me<00:02:29.320> it<00:02:29.500> causes<00:02:29.950> massive<00:02:30.400> bonus<00:02:30.970> damage

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
it at me it causes massive bonus damage

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:33.600

obviously the Pimpernel is not included
in<00:02:36.880> that<00:02:37.230> so<00:02:38.230> um<00:02:39.150> if<00:02:40.150> you're<00:02:40.390> able<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.810> shoot<00:02:41.050> an

in that so um if you're able to shoot an

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.650 
in that so um if you're able to shoot an
enemy<00:02:41.350> to<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.980> point<00:02:42.250> where<00:02:42.459> all<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:43.300> pellets

enemy to the point where all the pellets
jump<00:02:44.050> up<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.410> hit<00:02:44.760> hit<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:45.910> critical<00:02:46.120> spot

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
jump up and hit hit the critical spot

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.260

before flowering out you're going to do
massive<00:02:49.660> damage<00:02:49.959> let's<00:02:50.560> take<00:02:50.770> a<00:02:50.800> look<00:02:51.100> at<00:02:51.370> just

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
massive damage let's take a look at just

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.390 
massive damage let's take a look at just
a<00:02:51.910> regular<00:02:52.330> head<00:02:52.540> shot<00:02:54.150> got<00:02:55.150> about<00:02:56.190> looks<00:02:57.190> like

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
a regular head shot got about looks like

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.940 
a regular head shot got about looks like
2.9<00:02:58.239> million<00:02:58.570> there<00:02:58.930> but<00:02:59.260> if<00:02:59.350> we<00:02:59.500> aim<00:02:59.680> down

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
2.9 million there but if we aim down

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.430 
2.9 million there but if we aim down
here<00:03:00.220> at<00:03:00.310> its<00:03:00.430> dick<00:03:01.080> we're<00:03:02.080> going<00:03:02.200> to<00:03:02.260> get<00:03:02.350> a

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
here at its dick we're going to get a

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.770 
here at its dick we're going to get a
critical<00:03:02.980> and<00:03:03.580> we're<00:03:04.060> going<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.239> get<00:03:04.360> a<00:03:04.510> lot

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
critical and we're going to get a lot

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.460 
critical and we're going to get a lot
higher<00:03:05.080> in<00:03:05.320> him<00:03:05.500> let<00:03:05.770> me<00:03:05.890> get<00:03:06.250> the<00:03:06.370> right<00:03:06.400> spot

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.990 

alright<00:03:11.470> got<00:03:11.709> a<00:03:11.739> critical<00:03:12.010> there<00:03:12.370> and<00:03:12.640> you<00:03:12.790> saw

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
alright got a critical there and you saw

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.420 
alright got a critical there and you saw
that<00:03:13.030> one<00:03:13.360> did<00:03:13.570> over<00:03:13.959> 5<00:03:14.230> there<00:03:14.560> was<00:03:14.709> one<00:03:14.980> damage

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
that one did over 5 there was one damage

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.120 
that one did over 5 there was one damage
there<00:03:15.670> did<00:03:15.970> over<00:03:16.180> 5<00:03:16.450> million<00:03:16.769> had<00:03:17.769> some

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
there did over 5 million had some

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:20.520 
there did over 5 million had some
they're<00:03:18.519> doing<00:03:18.910> over<00:03:19.180> 14<00:03:19.720> million<00:03:20.049> eight

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
they're doing over 14 million eight

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:23.520 
they're doing over 14 million eight
billion<00:03:21.010> 14<00:03:22.000> million<00:03:22.360> again<00:03:22.690> as<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.230> can<00:03:23.380> see

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
billion 14 million again as you can see

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:24.960 
billion 14 million again as you can see
we're<00:03:23.650> getting<00:03:23.860> multiple<00:03:24.070> criticals<00:03:24.760> per

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
we're getting multiple criticals per

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.240 
we're getting multiple criticals per
shot<00:03:25.299> this<00:03:26.080> is<00:03:26.290> what<00:03:26.440> makes<00:03:26.650> the<00:03:26.860> pepper<00:03:27.070> now

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
shot this is what makes the pepper now

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.180 
shot this is what makes the pepper now
so<00:03:27.640> deadly<00:03:28.209> with<00:03:28.390> zero<00:03:28.660> you're<00:03:29.620> actually<00:03:30.010> able

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
so deadly with zero you're actually able

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.759 
so deadly with zero you're actually able
to<00:03:30.310> get<00:03:30.640> insane<00:03:31.630> amounts<00:03:31.989> of<00:03:32.110> damage<00:03:32.260> with

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
to get insane amounts of damage with

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.090 
to get insane amounts of damage with
just<00:03:33.040> one<00:03:33.280> sniper<00:03:33.580> rifle<00:03:34.090> shot<00:03:34.709> if<00:03:35.709> you<00:03:35.769> have

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
just one sniper rifle shot if you have

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.340 
just one sniper rifle shot if you have
critical<00:03:36.459> ascension<00:03:37.000> you<00:03:37.450> know<00:03:37.600> active<00:03:38.110> and

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:38.350 
critical ascension you know active and

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:40.380 
critical ascension you know active and
at<00:03:38.560> a<00:03:38.620> decent<00:03:39.100> stat<00:03:39.280> count<00:03:39.580> it<00:03:39.790> will<00:03:40.000> get<00:03:40.150> even

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
at a decent stat count it will get even

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.550 
at a decent stat count it will get even
more<00:03:40.780> gnarly<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:42.510> with<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:44.170> pimpernel

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560 
more gnarly so with a the pimpernel

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.699 
more gnarly so with a the pimpernel
though<00:03:44.739> like<00:03:45.040> if<00:03:45.280> i<00:03:45.459> increase<00:03:45.670> my<00:03:46.709> velocity

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
though like if i increase my velocity

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.880 
though like if i increase my velocity
count<00:03:48.269> you'll<00:03:49.269> see<00:03:49.570> that<00:03:50.049> it<00:03:50.200> now<00:03:50.350> jumps<00:03:50.739> up

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890 
count you'll see that it now jumps up

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.789 
count you'll see that it now jumps up
much<00:03:51.370> higher<00:03:51.400> before<00:03:52.110> exploded<00:03:53.110> it<00:03:53.260> or

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
much higher before exploded it or

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.220 
much higher before exploded it or
splitting<00:03:54.250> out<00:03:54.400> in<00:03:54.549> five<00:03:54.820> my<00:03:55.600> column<00:03:55.930> added

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
splitting out in five my column added

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:58.380 
splitting out in five my column added
five<00:03:56.470> extra<00:03:56.799> points<00:03:56.829> to<00:03:57.310> velocities<00:03:58.000> and<00:03:58.239> now

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:58.390 
five extra points to velocities and now

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:01.199 
five extra points to velocities and now
I<00:03:58.420> have<00:03:58.750> six<00:03:59.470> total<00:03:59.680> points<00:04:00.070> at<00:04:00.190> it<00:04:00.310> whereas

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
I have six total points at it whereas

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.539 
I have six total points at it whereas
this<00:04:01.480> was<00:04:01.720> zero<00:04:02.110> and<00:04:02.410> this<00:04:02.739> was<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.130> distance

00:04:03.539 --> 00:04:03.549 
this was zero and this was the distance

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:07.590 
this was zero and this was the distance
with<00:04:03.910> one<00:04:04.829> you<00:04:05.829> can<00:04:05.860> see<00:04:06.220> with<00:04:06.430> six<00:04:06.730> points<00:04:07.000> the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
with one you can see with six points the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.060 
with one you can see with six points the
jump<00:04:08.019> has<00:04:08.290> gotten<00:04:08.680> even<00:04:08.860> higher<00:04:09.930> so<00:04:10.930> let's<00:04:11.769> try

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
jump has gotten even higher so let's try

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.040 
jump has gotten even higher so let's try
to<00:04:12.130> get<00:04:12.700> a

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.050 

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:18.390 

split<00:04:17.050> out<00:04:17.170> there<00:04:17.410> all<00:04:17.590> right<00:04:17.709> so<00:04:17.950> we<00:04:18.190> got

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
split out there all right so we got

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.970 
split out there all right so we got
about<00:04:18.940> the<00:04:19.090> critical<00:04:19.510> zone<00:04:19.540> now<00:04:20.050> about<00:04:20.770> the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
about the critical zone now about the

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.100 
about the critical zone now about the
sweet<00:04:21.250> spot<00:04:21.550> as<00:04:22.180> you<00:04:22.450> can<00:04:22.540> see<00:04:22.720> these<00:04:22.930> sweet

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
sweet spot as you can see these sweet

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
sweet spot as you can see these sweet
spot<00:04:23.500> changes<00:04:24.070> per<00:04:24.370> enemy<00:04:24.790> and<00:04:25.800> it's<00:04:26.800> very

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
spot changes per enemy and it's very

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.000 
spot changes per enemy and it's very
dependent<00:04:27.400> on<00:04:27.700> the<00:04:28.300> amount<00:04:28.600> of<00:04:28.860> velocity<00:04:29.860> you

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
dependent on the amount of velocity you

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.270 
dependent on the amount of velocity you
have<00:04:30.420> but<00:04:31.420> if<00:04:31.570> you're<00:04:31.780> able<00:04:31.960> to<00:04:32.230> get<00:04:32.470> it<00:04:32.620> you'll

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
have but if you're able to get it you'll

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.460 
have but if you're able to get it you'll
be<00:04:33.460> doing<00:04:33.760> massive<00:04:34.240> amounts<00:04:34.900> of<00:04:34.930> damage<00:04:35.110> with

be doing massive amounts of damage with
the<00:04:35.560> Pimpernel<00:04:37.380> it's<00:04:38.380> also<00:04:38.590> because<00:04:39.190> of<00:04:39.220> the

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
the Pimpernel it's also because of the

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.660 
the Pimpernel it's also because of the
unique<00:04:40.180> firing<00:04:40.840> mechanics<00:04:41.350> of<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:41.740> a<00:04:41.890> great

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:42.670 
unique firing mechanics of it a great

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:46.020 
unique firing mechanics of it a great

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
weapon for typing on the go you can kind

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.800 
weapon for typing on the go you can kind
of<00:04:46.090> just<00:04:46.150> aim<00:04:46.990> down<00:04:47.680> at<00:04:48.120> depending<00:04:49.120> on<00:04:49.240> where

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
of just aim down at depending on where

you<00:04:50.110> have<00:04:50.290> your<00:04:50.500> points<00:04:50.830> and<00:04:50.950> velocity<00:04:51.460> maybe

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
you have your points and velocity maybe

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.360 
you have your points and velocity maybe
at<00:04:52.330> the<00:04:52.480> feet<00:04:52.720> of<00:04:52.900> something<00:04:53.410> and<00:04:53.620> you're<00:04:54.250> able

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:54.370 
at the feet of something and you're able

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.690 
at the feet of something and you're able
to<00:04:54.840> get<00:04:55.840> it<00:04:55.990> to<00:04:56.020> do<00:04:56.260> massive<00:04:56.770> damage<00:04:56.800> that<00:04:57.310> way

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
to get it to do massive damage that way

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.180 
to get it to do massive damage that way
I've<00:04:57.790> actually<00:04:58.180> one-shot<00:04:59.050> the<00:04:59.770> dragon

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
I've actually one-shot the dragon

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:03.510 
I've actually one-shot the dragon
sometimes<00:05:00.460> at<00:05:00.910> a<00:05:00.940> high<00:05:01.120> enough<00:05:01.890> stat<00:05:02.890> count<00:05:03.220> by

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
sometimes at a high enough stat count by

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.460 
sometimes at a high enough stat count by
getting<00:05:03.940> Pimpernel<00:05:04.450> to<00:05:04.630> actually<00:05:05.020> jump<00:05:05.290> up

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
getting Pimpernel to actually jump up

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:06.990 
getting Pimpernel to actually jump up
and<00:05:05.650> bore<00:05:06.010> straight<00:05:06.130> through<00:05:06.730> their<00:05:06.850> little

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
and bore straight through their little

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000 
and bore straight through their little
chin<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.600> got<00:05:07.720> all<00:05:07.930> five<00:05:08.200> pellets<00:05:08.710> in<00:05:08.860> the

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
chin and got all five pellets in the

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.390 
chin and got all five pellets in the
critical<00:05:09.400> zone<00:05:10.470> anyway<00:05:11.470> this<00:05:12.070> is<00:05:12.250> why<00:05:12.370> I

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 
critical zone anyway this is why I

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.540 
critical zone anyway this is why I
really<00:05:12.910> liked<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:13.510> Pimpernel<00:05:14.020> it's<00:05:14.410> a<00:05:14.680> really

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
really liked the Pimpernel it's a really

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:20.040 
really liked the Pimpernel it's a really
great<00:05:15.790> for<00:05:16.180> stuff<00:05:16.480> like<00:05:16.690> this<00:05:16.900> and<00:05:18.150> if<00:05:19.150> you're

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
great for stuff like this and if you're

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.110 
great for stuff like this and if you're
going<00:05:20.260> to<00:05:20.500> use<00:05:20.710> it<00:05:20.920> you're<00:05:21.310> going<00:05:21.490> to<00:05:21.640> have<00:05:21.850> to

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.120 
going to use it you're going to have to

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.610 
going to use it you're going to have to
you<00:05:23.110> know<00:05:23.230> learn<00:05:23.620> the<00:05:24.130> tricks<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:25.620> mysteries

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
you know learn the tricks and mysteries

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.490 
you know learn the tricks and mysteries
of<00:05:26.830> the<00:05:26.980> Pimpernel<00:05:27.400> um<00:05:27.720> where<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.990> sweet<00:05:29.230> spot

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
of the Pimpernel um where the sweet spot

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.980 
of the Pimpernel um where the sweet spot
is<00:05:29.620> going<00:05:29.710> to<00:05:29.770> be<00:05:29.950> on<00:05:30.160> certain<00:05:30.550> enemies

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
is going to be on certain enemies

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.430 
is going to be on certain enemies
sometimes<00:05:31.990> it's<00:05:32.200> a<00:05:32.230> little<00:05:32.320> bit

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 
sometimes it's a little bit

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.400 
sometimes it's a little bit
counterintuitive<00:05:32.890> you<00:05:33.580> don't<00:05:33.760> think<00:05:34.060> that<00:05:34.330> uh

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
counterintuitive you don't think that uh

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.840 
counterintuitive you don't think that uh
you<00:05:35.410> know<00:05:35.440> shooting<00:05:35.890> the<00:05:36.010> ground<00:05:36.280> maybe<00:05:36.580> below

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:36.850 
you know shooting the ground maybe below

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:39.660 
you know shooting the ground maybe below
an<00:05:37.120> enemy<00:05:37.480> would<00:05:37.660> be<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.990> best<00:05:38.230> strategy<00:05:38.800> but

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
an enemy would be the best strategy but

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.610 
an enemy would be the best strategy but
it<00:05:39.820> actually<00:05:40.000> is<00:05:40.450> in<00:05:40.750> some<00:05:40.960> cases<00:05:41.410> especially

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:41.620 
it actually is in some cases especially

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.740 
it actually is in some cases especially
with<00:05:42.190> like<00:05:42.340> spider<00:05:43.060> answer<00:05:43.420> whatnot<00:05:44.130> um<00:05:45.130> I

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:45.750 
with like spider answer whatnot um I

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:49.140 
with like spider answer whatnot um I
have<00:05:46.750> been<00:05:47.310> experimenting<00:05:48.310> you<00:05:48.790> know<00:05:48.910> with

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
have been experimenting you know with

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
have been experimenting you know with
different<00:05:51.240> velocity<00:05:52.240> counts<00:05:52.630> and<00:05:52.780> whatnot

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
different velocity counts and whatnot

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.750 
different velocity counts and whatnot
and<00:05:53.440> for<00:05:53.620> some<00:05:53.770> areas<00:05:54.130> you<00:05:54.160> might<00:05:54.520> actually

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:54.760 
and for some areas you might actually

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.120 
and for some areas you might actually
work<00:05:55.120> six<00:05:55.420> points<00:05:55.720> in<00:05:55.810> velocity<00:05:56.380> in<00:05:56.620> other

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
work six points in velocity in other

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.130 
work six points in velocity in other
areas<00:05:57.640> you<00:05:57.760> might<00:05:57.940> only<00:05:58.180> want<00:05:58.450> four<00:05:58.720> points<00:05:59.050> in

00:05:59.130 --> 00:05:59.140 
areas you might only want four points in

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:01.950 
areas you might only want four points in
velocity<00:06:00.060> it<00:06:01.060> should<00:06:01.240> also<00:06:01.360> be<00:06:01.510> noted<00:06:01.630> that

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
velocity it should also be noted that

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.200 
velocity it should also be noted that
the<00:06:02.200> pimper<00:06:02.800> metal<00:06:03.040> is<00:06:03.190> great<00:06:03.640> for<00:06:04.000> stacking

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:04.210 
the pimper metal is great for stacking

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.960 
the pimper metal is great for stacking
rising<00:06:04.870> shots<00:06:05.140> you<00:06:05.710> can<00:06:05.830> get<00:06:06.010> five<00:06:06.400> rising

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:06.970 
rising shots you can get five rising
