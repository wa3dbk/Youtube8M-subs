00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
do a great job so here's the speaker

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.329 
do a great job so here's the speaker
itself<00:01:03.480> kind<00:01:04.229> of<00:01:04.290> looks<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.559> egg<00:01:04.920> type

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
itself kind of looks like a egg type

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.840 
itself kind of looks like a egg type
thing<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:06.600> looks<00:01:06.780> like<00:01:06.960> one<00:01:07.290> type<00:01:07.860> almost<00:01:08.640> like

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
thing it looks like one type almost like

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.310 
thing it looks like one type almost like
one<00:01:09.090> speaker<00:01:09.479> at<00:01:09.600> first<00:01:09.869> but<00:01:10.080> it<00:01:10.140> actually

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
one speaker at first but it actually

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.820 
one speaker at first but it actually
comes<00:01:10.710> apart<00:01:11.720> because<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:13.110> Mac<00:01:13.590> it's

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
comes apart because it's Mac it's

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.910 
comes apart because it's Mac it's
actually<00:01:14.130> magnetized<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:15.689> it<00:01:15.780> comes<00:01:15.930> apart<00:01:16.170> to

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
actually magnetized so it comes apart to

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.249 
actually magnetized so it comes apart to
form<00:01:17.189> a<00:01:17.250> little<00:01:17.520> too<00:01:17.700> speaker<00:01:18.090> system<00:01:18.509> let's

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
form a little too speaker system let's

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.450 
form a little too speaker system let's
go<00:01:19.380> ahead<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.560> take<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.770> look<00:01:19.860> at<00:01:20.130> one<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.310> them

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
go ahead and take a look at one of them

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.190 
go ahead and take a look at one of them
so<00:01:21.390> here<00:01:21.689> we<00:01:21.960> have<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.380> off<00:01:22.650> switch<00:01:22.680> and

and this has to do with the cables so
this<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.920> charging<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:42.000> the

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
this is for charging it and for the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.109 
this is for charging it and for the
audio<00:01:42.860> right<00:01:43.860> here<00:01:44.130> we<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.399> 3.5

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
audio right here we have a 3.5

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.380 
audio right here we have a 3.5
millimeter<00:01:45.149> jack<00:01:46.079> input<00:01:46.729> this<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.939> for<00:01:48.119> daisy

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
millimeter jack input this is for daisy

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.389 
millimeter jack input this is for daisy
chaining<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.250> can

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
chaining and what that is you can

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.429 
chaining and what that is you can
actually<00:01:50.430> connect<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.270> connect<00:01:51.960> more<00:01:52.229> than

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
actually connect up connect more than

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:56.080 
actually connect up connect more than
two<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.880> capsules<00:01:54.840> if<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.560> want<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.950> you

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
two of the capsules if you want and you

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.639 
two of the capsules if you want and you
can<00:01:57.090> add<00:01:57.329> a<00:01:57.360> bunch<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.960> them<00:01:58.170> just<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.469> add<00:01:58.619> a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
can add a bunch of them just to add a

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.260 
can add a bunch of them just to add a
whole<00:01:59.100> like<00:02:00.170> like<00:02:01.170> surround<00:02:01.680> sound<00:02:02.009> maybe

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.270 
whole like like surround sound maybe

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.330 
whole like like surround sound maybe
it's<00:02:03.270> like<00:02:03.329> a<00:02:03.390> big<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:04.110> bigger<00:02:04.409> speaker<00:02:04.950> system

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
it's like a big a bigger speaker system

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.100 
it's like a big a bigger speaker system
the<00:02:05.460> might<00:02:05.670> sound<00:02:06.000> a<00:02:06.060> lot<00:02:06.210> better<00:02:06.270> but<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.840> don't

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
the might sound a lot better but I don't

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.869 
the might sound a lot better but I don't
have<00:02:07.229> these<00:02:07.409> two<00:02:07.649> so<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:07.890> haven't<00:02:08.190> daisy

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
have these two so I haven't daisy

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:09.779 
have these two so I haven't daisy
chained

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
chained

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.500 
chained
but<00:02:10.030> it<00:02:10.209> is<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:11.049> is<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.200> neat<00:02:11.409> feature<00:02:12.510> these

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.630 
it pops up like that and that doesn't
prevent<00:06:10.030> this<00:06:10.620> what<00:06:11.620> it<00:06:11.710> does<00:06:11.920> is<00:06:12.220> it<00:06:12.280> just

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:12.640
