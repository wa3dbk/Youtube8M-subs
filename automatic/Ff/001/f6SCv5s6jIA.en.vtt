00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.190 
that he could be confident dealing at
the<00:04:18.450> next<00:04:18.720> realm<00:04:18.900> I<00:04:20.989> guess<00:04:21.989> what<00:04:22.109> I'm<00:04:22.169> trying

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
the next realm I guess what I'm trying

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.150 
the next realm I guess what I'm trying
to<00:04:22.410> say<00:04:22.560> is

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
to say is

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.650 
to say is
to<00:04:23.280> get<00:04:23.430> the<00:04:23.580> faith<00:04:23.790> most<00:04:24.150> people<00:04:24.360> miss<00:04:24.510> it

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
to get the faith most people miss it

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.460 
to get the faith most people miss it
what<00:04:25.530> motivated<00:04:26.010> David<00:04:26.490> was<00:04:26.820> encouraged

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
what motivated David was encouraged

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.260 
what motivated David was encouraged
because<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.620> disciples<00:04:28.950> walk<00:04:29.670> with<00:04:29.850> Jesus

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
because the disciples walk with Jesus

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.170 
because the disciples walk with Jesus
and<00:04:30.540> they<00:04:30.630> fled<00:04:31.280> at<00:04:32.280> one<00:04:32.460> point<00:04:32.670> at<00:04:32.940> other

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
and they fled at one point at other

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.260 
and they fled at one point at other
points<00:04:33.600> they<00:04:34.290> martyred<00:04:34.740> they<00:04:34.950> didn't<00:04:35.250> run<00:04:35.430> so

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
points they martyred they didn't run so

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.150 
points they martyred they didn't run so
I<00:04:36.540> would<00:04:36.810> say<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.170> the<00:04:37.320> gifts<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:37.740> Spirit

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:38.160 
I would say that the gifts of the Spirit

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:39.770 
I would say that the gifts of the Spirit
are<00:04:38.280> a<00:04:38.340> major<00:04:38.610> part<00:04:39.000> of<00:04:39.180> what<00:04:39.240> you<00:04:39.450> get<00:04:39.570> and

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
are a major part of what you get and

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.110 
are a major part of what you get and
when<00:04:40.140> you<00:04:40.230> have<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.440> gift<00:04:40.680> of<00:04:40.830> faith<00:04:41.040> you<00:04:41.310> have

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
when you have a gift of faith you have

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.330 
when you have a gift of faith you have
the<00:04:42.270> ability<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.780> see<00:04:43.230> a<00:04:43.260> solution<00:04:43.860> to<00:04:43.980> solve<00:04:44.190> a

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 
the ability to see a solution to solve a

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.340 
the ability to see a solution to solve a
problem<00:04:44.490> or<00:04:44.850> I<00:04:44.880> forget<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.420> you<00:04:45.990> have<00:04:46.200> the

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
problem or I forget that you have the

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.930 
problem or I forget that you have the
confidence<00:04:46.590> to<00:04:47.010> solve<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.370> problem<00:04:47.550> even

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
confidence to solve a problem even

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.250 
confidence to solve a problem even
before<00:04:48.090> you<00:04:48.420> know<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.660> solution<00:04:51.080> you<00:04:52.080> have

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
before you know the solution you have

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:53.750 
before you know the solution you have
the<00:04:52.380> confidence<00:04:52.680> to<00:04:53.070> solve<00:04:53.370> a<00:04:53.460> problem<00:04:53.550> you

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:53.760 
the confidence to solve a problem you

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:55.310 
the confidence to solve a problem you
know<00:04:53.850> I<00:04:53.880> know<00:04:54.090> that<00:04:54.330> because<00:04:54.570> David<00:04:55.080> didn't

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
know I know that because David didn't

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.950 
know I know that because David didn't
have<00:04:55.440> a<00:04:55.470> strategy<00:04:56.090> when<00:04:57.090> he<00:04:57.180> saw<00:04:57.360> the<00:04:57.420> giant

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
have a strategy when he saw the giant

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.570 
have a strategy when he saw the giant
the<00:04:58.530> first<00:04:58.770> thing<00:04:58.920> to<00:04:59.010> do<00:04:59.100> is<00:04:59.220> he<00:04:59.310> put<00:04:59.490> on

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
the first thing to do is he put on

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.300 
the first thing to do is he put on
Saul's<00:04:59.880> armor<00:05:00.270> what<00:05:00.780> did<00:05:00.960> David<00:05:01.200> have<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:01.770> gift

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
Saul's armor what did David have a gift

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:04.990 
Saul's armor what did David have a gift
to<00:05:02.580> face<00:05:02.850> they<00:05:03.120> know<00:05:03.330> that<00:05:03.600> Giants<00:05:04.170> gotta<00:05:04.380> go

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
to face they know that Giants gotta go

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.070 
to face they know that Giants gotta go
right<00:05:06.710> what<00:05:07.710> didn't<00:05:08.010> he<00:05:08.070> have<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.430> plan<00:05:09.080> so

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
right what didn't he have a plan so

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.790 
right what didn't he have a plan so
here's<00:05:10.260> something<00:05:10.500> totally

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
here's something totally

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.050 
here's something totally
counterintuitive<00:05:11.250> but<00:05:11.730> it's<00:05:11.820> telling<00:05:11.940> you

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
counterintuitive but it's telling you

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.520 
counterintuitive but it's telling you
this<00:05:12.120> is<00:05:12.270> how<00:05:12.390> it<00:05:12.480> works<00:05:12.690> works<00:05:12.930> for<00:05:13.140> me<00:05:13.260> anyway

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:13.530 
this is how it works works for me anyway

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.710 
this is how it works works for me anyway
you<00:05:14.460> got<00:05:14.640> to<00:05:14.760> know<00:05:14.910> what<00:05:15.060> God's<00:05:15.240> called<00:05:15.570> you<00:05:15.690> to
