want<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.449> do<00:00:55.440> another<00:00:57.260> latching<00:00:58.260> because<00:00:58.530> I

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
want to do another latching because I

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.420 
want to do another latching because I
saw<00:00:58.739> them<00:00:58.890> decided<00:00:59.309> if<00:00:59.370> I'm<00:00:59.460> going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.850> uh<00:01:01.430> keep

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
saw them decided if I'm going to uh keep

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.890 
saw them decided if I'm going to uh keep
the<00:01:03.180> locks<00:01:03.510> in<00:01:04.250> we're<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.670> go<00:01:06.659> loose

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
the locks in we're going to go loose

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.469 
the locks in we're going to go loose
because<00:01:07.890> if<00:01:08.130> I<00:01:08.220> go<00:01:08.430> loose<00:01:08.729> will<00:01:08.939> be<00:01:09.030> easier<00:01:09.420> to

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
because if I go loose will be easier to

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.140 
because if I go loose will be easier to
unlatch<00:01:10.020> palm<00:01:10.470> roblox<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.520> poster<00:01:11.909> I

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150

supposed<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.000> black<00:01:15.180> locks<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:16.350> I'm<00:01:16.530> kind<00:01:16.740> of

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
supposed to black locks so I'm kind of

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.330 
supposed to black locks so I'm kind of
holding<00:01:17.100> off<00:01:17.280> on<00:01:18.049> really<00:01:19.049> doing<00:01:19.259> anything<00:01:19.439> but

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340

thanksgiving<00:01:31.710> bright<00:01:31.890> out<00:01:32.180> it<00:01:33.180> was<00:01:33.329> actually

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
thanksgiving bright out it was actually

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.210 
thanksgiving bright out it was actually
it<00:01:33.750> was<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> little<00:01:34.170> bit<00:01:34.320> harder<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> braid<00:01:35.189> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
it was a little bit harder to braid it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.260 
it was a little bit harder to braid it
but<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.509> ends<00:01:37.049> um<00:01:37.640> cut<00:01:38.640> because<00:01:38.970> all<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
but the ends um cut because all the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.630 
but the ends um cut because all the
other<00:01:39.299> I'd<00:01:39.570> really<00:01:39.780> blunt<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.439> thick<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:41.100> could

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
other I'd really blunt and thick I could

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.789 
other I'd really blunt and thick I could
kind<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.909> cut<00:01:42.150> at<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.420> biggest<00:01:43.380> part<00:01:43.590> of<00:01:43.649> each

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
kind of cut at the biggest part of each

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.789 
kind of cut at the biggest part of each
lock<00:01:44.040> so<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.880> effect<00:01:45.299> of<00:01:45.540> blunt<00:01:45.869> end<00:01:46.170> so<00:01:46.530> trying

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
lock so in effect of blunt end so trying

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.289 
lock so in effect of blunt end so trying
to<00:01:46.890> braid<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.640> like<00:01:47.790> really<00:01:48.030> hard

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
to braid it was like really hard

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:50.840 
to braid it was like really hard
actually<00:01:48.890> because<00:01:49.890> usually<00:01:50.130> my<00:01:50.399> natural<00:01:50.729> ends

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
actually because usually my natural ends

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.030 
actually because usually my natural ends
they<00:01:51.030> taper<00:01:51.299> it<00:01:51.450> down<00:01:51.750> so<00:01:52.140> we<00:01:52.290> can<00:01:52.350> do<00:01:52.799> a<00:01:52.829> little

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
they taper it down so we can do a little

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.730 
they taper it down so we can do a little
and<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:54.000> braid<00:01:54.180> up<00:01:54.329> nicely<00:01:54.540> but<00:01:54.899> finally<00:01:55.710> i

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
and the braid up nicely but finally i

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.090 
and the braid up nicely but finally i
