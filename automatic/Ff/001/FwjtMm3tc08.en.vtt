updated price for the design the price

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.970 
updated price for the design the price
is<00:00:33.390> reasonable<00:00:33.930> because<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.350> device<00:00:34.649> doesn't

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
is reasonable because the device doesn't

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.950 
is reasonable because the device doesn't
look<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.250> attractive<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.180> is<00:00:36.390> simple

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
look that attractive it is simple

look that attractive it is simple
rectangle<00:00:37.620> style<00:00:37.950> with<00:00:38.460> all<00:00:38.700> plastic<00:00:39.270> type

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
rectangle style with all plastic type

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.690 
rectangle style with all plastic type
surface<00:00:40.020> I<00:00:40.200> honestly<00:00:40.739> don't<00:00:41.010> like<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.399> really

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
surface I honestly don't like the really

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.670 
surface I honestly don't like the really
sharp<00:00:41.969> edges<00:00:42.239> here<00:00:42.570> since<00:00:42.930> he<00:00:43.050> can<00:00:43.260> easily

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
sharp edges here since he can easily

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.010 
sharp edges here since he can easily
hurt<00:00:43.920> yourself<00:00:44.370> with<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.789> pointy<00:00:45.210> cut<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:45.750> wish

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
hurt yourself with the pointy cut I wish

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.540 
hurt yourself with the pointy cut I wish
they<00:00:46.170> could<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.410> made<00:00:46.620> these<00:00:46.800> size<00:00:47.070> more

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
they could have made these size more

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.360 
they could have made these size more
round<00:00:47.910> so<00:00:48.300> it<00:00:48.539> would<00:00:48.719> be<00:00:48.840> more<00:00:49.079> safer<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.129> hold

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
round so it would be more safer to hold

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.310 
round so it would be more safer to hold
it<00:00:50.489> in<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.789> hands<00:00:51.239> so<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.750> design<00:00:52.110> is

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it in the hands so the design is

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.900 
it in the hands so the design is
definitely<00:00:52.500> something<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.399> keep<00:00:53.550> in<00:00:53.730> mind

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
definitely something to keep in mind

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.580 
definitely something to keep in mind
when<00:00:54.180> you're<00:00:54.300> buying<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.530> said

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
when you're buying this but as I said

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.740 
when you're buying this but as I said
the<00:00:55.920> price<00:00:56.160> tag<00:00:56.430> on<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:56.789> device<00:00:57.120> isn't<00:00:57.629> that

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
the price tag on this device isn't that

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.869 
the price tag on this device isn't that
big<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.350> if<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.770> want<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.129> more<00:00:59.370> round<00:00:59.609> edges

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
big so if you want the more round edges

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.270 
big so if you want the more round edges
charging<00:01:00.570> station<00:01:01.020> you<00:01:01.590> should<00:01:01.800> know<00:01:01.949> about

charging station you should know about

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.759 
charging station you should know about
another<00:01:02.640> Aki<00:01:03.120> product<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.690> run<00:01:03.899> ten<00:01:04.439> dollars

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
surface that is capable of using the

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.399 
surface that is capable of using the
suction<00:01:38.579> cup<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.390> helps<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> device<00:01:40.079> stay

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
suction cup this helps the device stay

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.590 
suction cup this helps the device stay
on<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.710> table<00:01:41.100> surface<00:01:41.310> and<00:01:41.759> I<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.240> my<00:01:42.390> white

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
on the table surface and I have my white

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.660 
on the table surface and I have my white
table<00:01:43.020> here<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:43.590> place<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.100> double-sided

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
table here and I place the double-sided

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.850 
table here and I place the double-sided
suction<00:01:45.270> cup<00:01:45.479> in<00:01:45.689> between<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.229> device<00:01:46.619> and

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
suction cup in between this device and

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.429 
suction cup in between this device and
the<00:01:47.070> table<00:01:47.460> as<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.149> can<00:01:48.329> see<00:01:48.570> it's<00:01:48.990> hard<00:01:49.200> to

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
the table as you can see it's hard to

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.960 
the table as you can see it's hard to
move<00:01:49.680> the<00:01:49.860> device<00:01:50.189> since<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.759> together

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
move the device since it is together

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.510 
move the device since it is together
with<00:01:51.780> each<00:01:51.930> suction<00:01:52.290> cup<00:01:52.530> so<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> really<00:01:53.310> like

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
with each suction cup so I really like

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.700 
with each suction cup so I really like
the<00:01:53.700> addition<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.299> this<00:01:54.450> device<00:01:54.930> Aki<00:01:55.560> is

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the addition to this device Aki is

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.770 
the addition to this device Aki is
definitely<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.520> first<00:01:56.790> company<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.299> actually

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
definitely the first company to actually

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.600 
definitely the first company to actually
do<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.140> so<00:01:58.380> a<00:01:58.409> big<00:01:58.649> props<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.250> all<00:01:59.460> right

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
do this so a big props to that all right

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.730 
do this so a big props to that all right
so<00:01:59.759> it<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.270> now<00:02:00.540> it's<00:02:00.840> time<00:02:01.020> to<00:02:01.049> talk<00:02:01.350> about<00:02:01.409> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
so it is now it's time to talk about the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.399 
so it is now it's time to talk about the
USB<00:02:02.219> ports<00:02:02.610> this<00:02:02.909> device<00:02:03.420> has<00:02:03.719> an<00:02:03.899> output<00:02:04.200> of

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
USB ports this device has an output of

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.039 
USB ports this device has an output of
five<00:02:04.860> volts<00:02:05.280> or<00:02:05.399> in<00:02:05.640> other<00:02:05.850> words<00:02:06.149> eight<00:02:06.479> amps

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
five volts or in other words eight amps

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.330 
five volts or in other words eight amps
and<00:02:07.380> the<00:02:07.530> eight<00:02:07.740> amps

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
and the eight amps

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.790 
and the eight amps
from<00:02:08.700> each<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.119> five<00:02:09.330> USB<00:02:09.810> ports<00:02:10.140> because

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
from each of five USB ports because

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.680 
from each of five USB ports because
that's<00:02:11.009> going<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.400> too<00:02:11.730> much<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.450> charge

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
that's going to be too much to charge

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.680 
that's going to be too much to charge
another<00:02:13.050> device<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:14.010> actually<00:02:14.489> get<00:02:14.670> 2.4<00:02:15.450> m/s

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
another device you actually get 2.4 m/s

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.650 
another device you actually get 2.4 m/s
maximum<00:02:16.410> from<00:02:16.770> each<00:02:17.040> port<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.640> that<00:02:18.180> is<00:02:18.300> a<00:02:18.330> lot

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
maximum from each port and that is a lot

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.900 
maximum from each port and that is a lot
for<00:02:18.959> charging<00:02:19.380> another<00:02:19.620> device<00:02:20.040> to<00:02:20.700> make

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
for charging another device to make

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.120 
for charging another device to make
things<00:02:21.209> safer<00:02:21.660> Auggie<00:02:21.959> decided<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.800> add<00:02:22.950> a

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
things safer Auggie decided to add a

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.790 
things safer Auggie decided to add a
very<00:02:23.520> useful<00:02:23.849> feature<00:02:24.360> which<00:02:25.200> takes<00:02:25.500> care<00:02:25.769> of

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
very useful feature which takes care of

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.400 
very useful feature which takes care of
charging<00:02:26.340> speed<00:02:26.580> some<00:02:27.120> older<00:02:27.480> devices<00:02:27.989> cannot

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
charging speed some older devices cannot

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.250 
charging speed some older devices cannot
take<00:02:28.709> the<00:02:28.890> 2.4<00:02:29.550> amps<00:02:29.940> in<00:02:30.180> them<00:02:30.390> so<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> USB

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
take the 2.4 amps in them so the USB

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.589 
take the 2.4 amps in them so the USB
port<00:02:31.530> will<00:02:31.709> only<00:02:31.980> give<00:02:32.580> the<00:02:32.849> power<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.480> is

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
port will only give the power that is

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:35.900 
port will only give the power that is
only<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.170> full<00:02:34.470> speed<00:02:34.800> input<00:02:35.340> of<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.730> other

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
only the full speed input of the other

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.809 
only the full speed input of the other
device<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.660> if<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.349> device<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.920> capable<00:02:38.340> of

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
device and if the device is capable of

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.320 
device and if the device is capable of
taking<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.599> 2.4<00:02:40.230> m/s<00:02:40.440> input<00:02:41.100> then<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.910> USB

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
taking the 2.4 m/s input then the USB

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.210 
taking the 2.4 m/s input then the USB
port<00:02:42.600> will<00:02:42.750> definitely<00:02:43.200> provide<00:02:43.530> that<00:02:43.950> power

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
port will definitely provide that power

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.880 
port will definitely provide that power
and<00:02:44.549> just<00:02:45.000> as<00:02:45.120> a<00:02:45.150> reminder<00:02:45.420> all<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.230> five<00:02:46.500> USB

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
and just as a reminder all the five USB

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.940 
and just as a reminder all the five USB
ports<00:02:47.250> have<00:02:47.760> the<00:02:47.910> AI<00:02:48.120> technology<00:02:48.870> which<00:02:49.799> I

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
ports have the AI technology which I

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.949 
ports have the AI technology which I
said<00:02:50.250> in<00:02:50.489> the<00:02:50.580> beginning<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:51.120> this<00:02:51.269> video<00:02:51.630> when

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
said in the beginning of this video when

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.960 
said in the beginning of this video when
you<00:02:52.049> charge<00:02:52.319> multiple<00:02:52.739> devices<00:02:53.069> at<00:02:53.340> once<00:02:53.670> and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
you charge multiple devices at once and

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.910 
you charge multiple devices at once and
you<00:02:54.090> feel<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.540> charging<00:02:54.959> station<00:02:55.349> warm<00:02:55.560> up<00:02:55.739> a

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
you feel the charging station warm up a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.300 
you feel the charging station warm up a
little

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
little

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.250 
little
don't<00:02:56.700> worry<00:02:56.910> because<00:02:57.150> it<00:02:57.569> is<00:02:57.599> like<00:02:57.870> that<00:02:57.900> with

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
don't worry because it is like that with

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.470 
don't worry because it is like that with
every<00:02:58.709> Power<00:02:59.010> Station<00:02:59.610> because<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.360> is

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
every Power Station because it is

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.440 
every Power Station because it is
