00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:07.379
 PARTNERS DAY today is in this video 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.970
 around the annoying calorie topic 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.429
 I can not count how 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.250
 Often I am asked how much 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:17.369
 calories in the day I have to eat or 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.840
 May I eat to lose weight? 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.820
 and that's a question I'm asking 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:24.300
 simply can not answer at all 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.670
 with your personal calorie amount so 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.710
 what you need at the calorie 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.359
 calorie requirements are very many 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.239
 different factors 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.000
 one is his size your weight 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.940
 because your age is your name 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.910
 your movement so how active we are 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.500
 you are an activity level so how 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.660
 a lot of training and that is for me 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.930
 just do not answer at all 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.730
 Anyway, I think you are 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.489
 altogether of the calorie counting 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.710
 should keep a distance 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.930
 Because calorie counting is easy to feel 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.699
 you especially women when I noticed 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.739
 especially with the girls that they 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.600
 putting yourself under extreme pressure and you 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.200
 have in valleys in front of you and you only see 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.580
 another 50 calories 250 calories 600 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.130
 calories you do not see anymore 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.770
 you eat and not if the calories or 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.659
 hessen is a big piece 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.340
 Quality of life and you should not you 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.920
 your food really only in calories 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.170
 proteins carbohydrates often fats 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.490
 So that's super important, of course 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.920
 that you have an overview that you 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.420
 roughly know what you eat but it is 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.979
 not nice if you just that only 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.079
 is still reading in numbers is mine 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.430
 personal opinion and me afterwards too 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.130
 that there are a lot of people under it 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.110
 pressure and I think that fit 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.939
 be fun and lose weight 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.159
 should and not just pure stress 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.380
 anyway, I want you in 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.909
 this video had a formula 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.890
 because I like it so often 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.020
 asked 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.390
 with which you calculate your basic needs 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.909
 Please remember that shows immediately 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.979
 here depends on your opinion of 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.070
 a size and a weight like 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.900
 much calories per day that is required 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.850
 This is really your basic sales 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.590
 Of course, the formula is the same as most 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.720
 not exactly what that is 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.520
 but at least there are times 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.289
 so that as a rough guideline their 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.940
 I also like to imagine 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.709
 the other side that many people say 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.110
 human being today I was half an hour 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.750
 run or I have a bit 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.570
 rowed or I was cycling and 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.470
 now i can do so much 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.300
 eat as I like 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.000
 and many people underestimate 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.590
 just what you burn during sports 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.180
 and what they really do after that 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.709
 certain foods back to themselves 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.420
 and that's why it's often the case 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:35.150
 that people do not lose weight during sport 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.560
 because they burn calories 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.600
 usually less than they believe 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.090
 and will compensate by eating again 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.769
 so today in this video the forms 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.100
 with which calculate the basic revenue 

00:02:42.769 --> 00:02:44.750
 can 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.910
 Please remember that it is the basic turnover 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.250
 that is when you are active in sports 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.049
 then you can usually do a lot more 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.930
 to calories and to pack 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.970
 I hope that the formula please please 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.549
 calculate once and then you will 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.650
 maybe even be surprised how many 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:04.579
 In fact, you just actually calories 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:07.310
 needed per day we need for the 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:08.930
 following bill in and pound the 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.540
 means you have your size and yours 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.329
 weight once Convert 1 cm 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:18.049
 equals 0 3 ins and one kilogram 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:21.470
 equals 22 pounds here as an example 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:24.230
 if you are 170 cm tall then you count 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.410
 you get this one .39 and get that 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:29.120
 result 66.3 please write this 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.160
 number you will be equal for the time being 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.190
 next bill need one kilogram 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:36.110
 equals 22 and that means if you as 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:40.150
 For example, 70 kilograms until then 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.609
 do you expect 2.2 times and comes up with it 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:46.519
 So that's the best way to hold that 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:49.010
 video and calculates your size and 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:54.440
 your weight once in and in 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:55.670
 kilogram around for women and for men 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.140
 the bills are a little bit 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.520
 different here you see the 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:04.310
 bill only women 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:08.840
 count 655 +43 5 times your weight in the 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:16.250
 pound plus 47 times your size in inches 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:18.170
 minus 4.7 times your age I know this 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:19.700
 Bill sounds a bit complicated 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.040
 but you do not see them here yet 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.020
 the example if you so 1 meter 70 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:26.570
 are tall and weigh 70 kilograms 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:30.740
 if you pay all in the formula 1 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.890
 sets then you come to 1.495 51 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.950
 Calories are around 15 kilos of calories 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.510
 basic requirement if you are a man 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.550
 bill something different you have to 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:44.120
 just take other numbers in this 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.630
 case is the formula 66 plus 63 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:51.230
 twice your weight in pounds plus 12 7 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:53.920
 times your size in inches minus 6.8 times 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:53.920
 your age 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.410
 so if you are, for example 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.210
 80 tall is 85 kilos and weighs 30 years 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.580
 you are old then you come with this 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:11.720
 formula to a basic requirement of 1935 38 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.650
 calories are around 1900 and 40 calories 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.650
 basic needs 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.630
 I already have it at the beginning of the video 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.919
 once mentioned but I want to be here 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:23.930
 definitely repeat because 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.639
 it really matters so it acts 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.250
 This formula is really about the 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.919
 basic turnover that is, the more active one is doing 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.750
 the more sport is the more 

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:35.300
 Of course, you can get more calories a day 

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:38.150
 too low to lose weight you need 

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:40.130
 a slight calorie deficit that is 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:43.340
 Of course it is extremely important what you do 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:45.050
 Eats and it is also important how much you eat 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.520
 Eats opinion, it is important what 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.720
 you eat if you are the right one 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.490
 You can eat much more 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.350
 eat until much faster and fuller 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.820
 hate automatic small calories 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.470
 deficit or can be so much easier 

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:57.139
 units as if you really only 

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:59.930
 So fastfood and potion are calories 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:02.479
 deficit from 2 to 300 calories a day 

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:04.100
 is absolutely perfect for lasting 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:05.930
 to reduce body fat and yours 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.050
 stimulate further metabolism and not 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.520
 to come in such a hungry fashion where the 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:12.830
 metabolism totally shuts off and 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.620
 next you forward is nothing more 

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:17.510
 So a maximum of 2 to 300 calories per day 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:19.700
 with this formula kassel basic sales 

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:21.770
 count as a small example I am 

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.169
 relatively light and quite small 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.810
 with me comes with this formula scarce 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:30.470
 1300 calories out but I know that 

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:32.090
 I can eat about 2,000 calories without it 

00:06:30.470 --> 00:06:34.070
 even just a gram increase that is 

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.960
 Of course, because I'm relative 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.410
 I'm exercising frequently 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:41.450
