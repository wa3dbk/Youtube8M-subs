00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
of both patients and practitioners I

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.209 
of both patients and practitioners I
think<00:00:45.690> that<00:00:46.020> vigilante<00:00:46.379> was<00:00:46.649> really<00:00:47.039> amazing

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
think that vigilante was really amazing

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.190 
think that vigilante was really amazing
as<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.670> know<00:00:47.760> as<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> clinician<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.989> always

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
as you know as a clinician it's always

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.290 
as you know as a clinician it's always
you<00:00:49.890> know<00:00:49.980> hard<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.370> transmit<00:00:50.850> complex

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
you know hard to transmit complex

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.729 
you know hard to transmit complex
medical<00:00:51.449> ideas<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:51.989> when<00:00:52.079> you<00:00:52.170> visualize<00:00:52.350> it

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
medical ideas and when you visualize it

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.470 
medical ideas and when you visualize it
and<00:00:52.860> I'm<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.039> visual<00:00:53.219> thinker<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.760> think<00:00:54.180> it

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
and I'm a visual thinker I think it

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.750 
and I'm a visual thinker I think it
really<00:00:54.629> makes<00:00:54.899> it<00:00:55.020> easier<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.680> comprehend<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
really makes it easier to comprehend and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.369 
really makes it easier to comprehend and
make<00:00:57.239> it<00:00:57.329> actionable<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.020> understand

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
make it actionable so if you understand

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.510 
make it actionable so if you understand

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
is happening what the medical problems

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.090 
is happening what the medical problems
are<00:03:01.490> and<00:03:01.790> come<00:03:02.480> to<00:03:02.660> a<00:03:02.690> better<00:03:03.050> consensus<00:03:03.830> as<00:03:04.070> to

are and come to a better consensus as to

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.250 
are and come to a better consensus as to
you<00:03:05.090> know<00:03:05.120> what<00:03:05.330> the<00:03:05.450> physicians<00:03:05.900> should<00:03:05.960> do

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.020 
and what the patients want to have done
I<00:03:08.300> think<00:03:09.230> that<00:03:09.560> the<00:03:09.860> way<00:03:10.040> we<00:03:10.070> actually<00:03:10.610> process

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
I think that the way we actually process

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.720 
I think that the way we actually process
information<00:03:11.270> in<00:03:11.770> relationship<00:03:12.770> to<00:03:12.800> visual

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
information about our bodies is that

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.370 
information about our bodies is that
it's<00:03:16.400> just<00:03:16.550> a<00:03:16.670> sense<00:03:16.880> of<00:03:16.940> clarity<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.840> sense<00:03:18.260> of

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
it's just a sense of clarity a sense of

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.610 
it's just a sense of clarity a sense of
quick<00:03:18.680> understanding<00:03:18.950> and<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:20.390> also<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.260> its

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620

presenting the facts and that's going to

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:19.229 
presenting the facts and that's going to
take<00:04:16.760> you<00:04:17.150> know<00:04:17.210> a<00:04:17.270> lot<00:04:17.510> of<00:04:17.539> educational<00:04:17.750> work

but<00:04:20.239> we<00:04:20.450> feel<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:20.810> this

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040 
but we feel that this

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.030 
but we feel that this
use<00:04:22.280> the<00:04:22.460> way<00:04:22.580> forward<00:04:23.030> visuals<00:04:23.870> simply<00:04:24.800> are

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
use the way forward visuals simply are

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.270 
use the way forward visuals simply are
our<00:04:26.020> palpable<00:04:27.130> understandings<00:04:28.130> of<00:04:28.190> the

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
our palpable understandings of the

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.310 
our palpable understandings of the
functionality<00:04:28.850> of<00:04:28.880> your<00:04:28.940> body<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.450> they<00:04:30.260> are

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
functionality of your body and they are

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.890 
functionality of your body and they are
credible<00:04:30.860> so<00:04:31.490> we<00:04:31.790> believe<00:04:32.120> that<00:04:32.150> this<00:04:32.570> is<00:04:32.750> the

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
credible so we believe that this is the

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:35.200 
credible so we believe that this is the
methodology<00:04:33.680> that<00:04:34.040> will<00:04:34.370> actually<00:04:34.610> change

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:35.210 
methodology that will actually change

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.600 
methodology that will actually change
behavior<00:04:35.840> again<00:04:36.230> not<00:04:36.440> in<00:04:36.560> everybody<00:04:36.950> but<00:04:37.460> for

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
behavior again not in everybody but for

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.080 
behavior again not in everybody but for
those<00:04:37.700> people<00:04:37.910> who<00:04:38.090> are<00:04:38.330> interested<00:04:39.320> and<00:04:39.410> need

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.090 
those people who are interested and need

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.640 
those people who are interested and need
better<00:04:41.090> understanding<00:04:41.810> need<00:04:42.020> empowerment

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
better understanding need empowerment

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.620 
better understanding need empowerment
this<00:04:43.010> is<00:04:43.130> the<00:04:43.250> way<00:04:43.340> to<00:04:43.370> go<00:04:43.610> people<00:04:44.420> are

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:44.630 
this is the way to go people are

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.530 
this is the way to go people are
extremely<00:04:45.200> resistant<00:04:45.980> to<00:04:46.040> change<00:04:46.400> but<00:04:47.270> I

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
extremely resistant to change but I

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:50.170 
extremely resistant to change but I
believe<00:04:48.350> they're<00:04:48.920> about<00:04:49.100> fifteen<00:04:49.790> percent<00:04:50.030> of

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:50.180 
believe they're about fifteen percent of

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.210 
believe they're about fifteen percent of
the<00:04:50.240> population<00:04:50.360> wants<00:04:51.260> a<00:04:51.500> change<00:04:51.710> they<00:04:52.040> just

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
the population wants a change they just

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.010 
the population wants a change they just
don't<00:04:52.430> know<00:04:52.610> how<00:04:52.790> to<00:04:52.820> do<00:04:53.060> it<00:04:53.210> and<00:04:53.390> therefore

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
don't know how to do it and therefore

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.320 
don't know how to do it and therefore
this<00:04:54.350> is<00:04:54.530> a<00:04:54.560> opportunity<00:04:55.370> for<00:04:55.700> the<00:04:55.760> visual<00:04:56.000> md

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
this is a opportunity for the visual md

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.010 
this is a opportunity for the visual md
to<00:04:56.900> use<00:04:57.050> data<00:04:57.440> that<00:04:57.860> is<00:04:58.010> about<00:04:58.640> your<00:04:58.940> body<00:04:59.210> that

to use data that is about your body that

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.080 
to use data that is about your body that
shows<00:05:00.380> you<00:05:00.590> the<00:05:00.800> ravages<00:05:01.280> of<00:05:01.310> what<00:05:01.610> happens

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
shows you the ravages of what happens

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.660 
shows you the ravages of what happens
when<00:05:02.360> you<00:05:02.480> do<00:05:02.690> not<00:05:02.900> comply<00:05:03.500> either<00:05:04.190> with<00:05:04.490> your
