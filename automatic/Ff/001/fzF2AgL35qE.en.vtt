children<00:01:55.470> the<00:01:56.070> tonsils<00:01:56.550> are<00:01:56.729> actually<00:01:57.150> fairly

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
children the tonsils are actually fairly

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.620 
children the tonsils are actually fairly
large<00:01:57.840> their<00:01:58.560> purpose<00:01:59.040> is<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.360> kind<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.390> act

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
large their purpose is to kind of act

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.660 
large their purpose is to kind of act
like<00:02:00.840> little<00:02:01.049> traps<00:02:01.650> so<00:02:02.220> when<00:02:02.970> bacteria<00:02:03.420> or

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
like little traps so when bacteria or

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.910 
like little traps so when bacteria or
viruses<00:02:05.670> or<00:02:05.909> any<00:02:06.090> sort<00:02:06.420> of<00:02:06.450> microbe<00:02:06.930> gets<00:02:07.440> into

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
viruses or any sort of microbe gets into

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.949 
viruses or any sort of microbe gets into
the<00:02:08.099> mouth<00:02:08.340> or<00:02:08.670> potentially<00:02:09.660> through<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
the mouth or potentially through the

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.070 
the mouth or potentially through the
nasal<00:02:10.140> passage<00:02:10.679> then<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.640> tonsils<00:02:12.240> act<00:02:12.630> as<00:02:13.050> a

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
nasal passage then the tonsils act as a

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.780 
nasal passage then the tonsils act as a
first<00:02:13.470> line<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.740> defense

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
first line of defense

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.850 
first line of defense
tonsils<00:02:15.420> are<00:02:15.510> very<00:02:15.720> vascular<00:02:16.200> structures

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
tonsils are very vascular structures

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.740 
tonsils are very vascular structures
meaning<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.519> they<00:02:17.640> have<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:17.879> lot<00:02:18.269> of<00:02:18.299> blood

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
meaning that they have a lot of blood

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.990 
meaning that they have a lot of blood
vessels<00:02:18.780> going<00:02:19.470> to<00:02:19.590> them<00:02:19.769> and<00:02:19.980> they<00:02:20.430> also<00:02:20.640> have

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
vessels going to them and they also have

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.030 
vessels going to them and they also have
a<00:02:21.030> lot<00:02:21.299> of<00:02:21.329> white<00:02:21.750> blood<00:02:22.079> cells<00:02:22.140> in<00:02:22.620> them<00:02:22.799> and

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
a lot of white blood cells in them and

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.580 
a lot of white blood cells in them and
this<00:02:23.489> is<00:02:23.670> important<00:02:24.090> because<00:02:24.120> if<00:02:24.599> bacteria<00:02:25.049> or

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
this is important because if bacteria or

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.710 
this is important because if bacteria or
viruses<00:02:26.010> get<00:02:26.310> trapped<00:02:26.730> on<00:02:26.909> the<00:02:27.060> surface<00:02:27.510> of

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
viruses get trapped on the surface of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.420 
viruses get trapped on the surface of
the<00:02:27.840> tonsils<00:02:28.290> then<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.980> white<00:02:29.159> blood<00:02:29.370> cells

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
the tonsils then the white blood cells

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.039 
the tonsils then the white blood cells
can<00:02:29.790> respond<00:02:30.269> accordingly

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
can respond accordingly

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:33.740 
can respond accordingly
now<00:02:31.829> they're<00:02:31.980> particularly<00:02:32.640> important<00:02:33.329> when

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
now they're particularly important when

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.500 
now they're particularly important when
we're<00:02:34.379> young<00:02:34.650> as<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.129> said<00:02:35.310> before<00:02:35.489> because<00:02:36.090> our

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
we're young as I said before because our

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.809 
we're young as I said before because our
immune<00:02:36.840> system<00:02:37.260> is<00:02:37.349> still<00:02:37.560> developing<00:02:37.730> but<00:02:38.730> as

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
immune system is still developing but as

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.550 
immune system is still developing but as
we<00:02:38.970> get<00:02:39.090> older<00:02:39.150> the<00:02:39.480> tonsils<00:02:40.049> actually<00:02:40.409> will

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
we get older the tonsils actually will

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.330 
we get older the tonsils actually will
shrink<00:02:41.040> up<00:02:41.220> and<00:02:41.549> shrivel<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.209> smaller<00:02:42.569> size<00:02:42.870> so

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
shrink up and shrivel to smaller size so

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.699 
shrink up and shrivel to smaller size so
they<00:02:44.340> may<00:02:44.400> actually<00:02:44.640> shrink<00:02:45.349> to<00:02:46.349> become

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
they may actually shrink to become

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.910 
they may actually shrink to become
barely<00:02:47.579> visible<00:02:48.319> near<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.500> roof<00:02:49.680> of<00:02:49.829> the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
barely visible near the roof of the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.920 
barely visible near the roof of the
mouth<00:02:50.069> and<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:51.000> like<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.329> think<00:02:51.540> this<00:02:51.690> is

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
mouth and I like to think this is

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.960 
mouth and I like to think this is
because<00:02:52.409> when<00:02:53.159> we're<00:02:53.310> young<00:02:53.489> we're<00:02:53.700> still

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
because when we're young we're still

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.000 
because when we're young we're still
looking<00:02:54.389> for<00:02:54.420> many<00:02:54.900> different<00:02:55.170> types<00:02:55.560> of<00:02:55.739> bugs

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
looking for many different types of bugs

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.160 
looking for many different types of bugs
but<00:02:56.310> once<00:02:56.849> we're<00:02:57.000> older<00:02:57.329> we've<00:02:57.780> already<00:02:57.989> been

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
but once we're older we've already been

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.869 
but once we're older we've already been
exposed<00:02:58.230> to<00:02:58.799> all<00:02:58.920> these<00:02:59.040> different<00:02:59.250> bugs<00:02:59.639> and

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
exposed to all these different bugs and

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.789 
exposed to all these different bugs and
these<00:02:59.970> different<00:03:00.299> microbes<00:03:00.720> and<00:03:00.900> so<00:03:01.500> we<00:03:01.650> no

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
these different microbes and so we no

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.160 
these different microbes and so we no
longer<00:03:01.829> need<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.280> tonsils<00:03:02.849> to<00:03:03.090> inform<00:03:03.810> the

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
longer need the tonsils to inform the

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.020 
longer need the tonsils to inform the
rest<00:03:04.379> of<00:03:04.560> the<00:03:04.650> immune<00:03:04.920> system<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.579> get

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
rest of the immune system to get

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.240 
rest of the immune system to get
prepared<00:03:06.569> for<00:03:06.840> this<00:03:06.989> bug<00:03:07.319> because<00:03:07.680> our<00:03:08.010> body

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
prepared for this bug because our body

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.099 
prepared for this bug because our body
has<00:03:08.519> already<00:03:08.849> prepared<00:03:09.180> in<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.540> past<00:03:09.780> and

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:10.109 
has already prepared in the past and

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.140 
has already prepared in the past and
fought<00:03:10.530> off<00:03:10.680> an<00:03:10.859> infection<00:03:11.370> similar<00:03:11.909> to<00:03:12.060> the

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
fought off an infection similar to the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.509 
fought off an infection similar to the
one<00:03:12.329> that's<00:03:12.569> now<00:03:12.959> being<00:03:13.170> presented<00:03:13.739> so

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
one that's now being presented so

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.819 
one that's now being presented so
removal<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.450> tonsils<00:03:15.659> is<00:03:16.019> not<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.590> worst

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
removal of the tonsils is not the worst

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.379 
removal of the tonsils is not the worst
thing<00:03:17.099> in<00:03:17.159> the<00:03:17.280> world<00:03:17.370> and<00:03:17.849> there<00:03:18.269> are

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:18.389 
thing in the world and there are

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:19.819 
thing in the world and there are
actually<00:03:18.720> a<00:03:18.750> lot<00:03:18.989> of<00:03:19.049> really<00:03:19.379> good<00:03:19.560> reasons

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829 
actually a lot of really good reasons

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:22.490 
actually a lot of really good reasons
that<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.519> tonsils<00:03:20.970> should<00:03:21.449> be<00:03:21.569> removed<00:03:21.930> for

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
that the tonsils should be removed for

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.069 
that the tonsils should be removed for
example<00:03:22.919> some<00:03:23.459> patients<00:03:24.120> get<00:03:24.239> tonsils<00:03:24.810> that

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:25.079 
example some patients get tonsils that

00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.379 
example some patients get tonsils that
are<00:03:25.199> infected<00:03:25.650> over<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.609> over<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.060> over

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
are infected over and over and over

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.229 
are infected over and over and over
again<00:03:27.510> this<00:03:28.169> is<00:03:28.410> chronic<00:03:28.919> tonsillitis

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
again this is chronic tonsillitis

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.759 
again this is chronic tonsillitis
chronic<00:03:30.239> inflammation<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:31.079> the<00:03:31.109> tonsils<00:03:31.319> and

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
chronic inflammation of the tonsils and

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.699 
chronic inflammation of the tonsils and
so<00:03:32.280> patients<00:03:33.030> who<00:03:33.150> get<00:03:33.299> frequent<00:03:33.840> tonsillitis

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
so patients who get frequent tonsillitis

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.939 
so patients who get frequent tonsillitis
frequent<00:03:35.280> infections<00:03:36.180> should<00:03:36.870> actually<00:03:37.139> have

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:37.949 
frequent infections should actually have

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:38.569 
frequent infections should actually have
them<00:03:38.129> removed

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
them removed

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:40.819 
them removed
in<00:03:38.669> fact<00:03:39.449> frequent<00:03:39.959> infections<00:03:40.500> may<00:03:40.680> mean

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
in fact frequent infections may mean

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.589 
in fact frequent infections may mean
that<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:41.099> tonsils<00:03:41.489> have<00:03:41.549> become<00:03:42.000> colonized

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
that the tonsils have become colonized

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.199 
that the tonsils have become colonized
by<00:03:42.810> a<00:03:42.959> microbe<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.650> thus<00:03:44.010> the<00:03:44.220> removal<00:03:44.849> can

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
by a microbe and thus the removal can

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.050 
by a microbe and thus the removal can
stop<00:03:45.569> these<00:03:45.810> frequent<00:03:46.260> infections<00:03:47.060> so

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
stop these frequent infections so

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.210 
stop these frequent infections so
frequent<00:03:48.419> infections<00:03:48.810> is<00:03:48.930> one<00:03:49.139> along<00:03:50.099> the

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
frequent infections is one along the

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.699 
frequent infections is one along the
same<00:03:50.400> lines<00:03:50.690> development<00:03:51.690> of<00:03:51.810> an<00:03:52.049> abscess

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
same lines development of an abscess

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.309 
same lines development of an abscess
near<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.669> tonsils<00:03:54.209> can<00:03:54.690> be<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.840> reason<00:03:55.290> for

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
near the tonsils can be a reason for

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.339 
near the tonsils can be a reason for
removal<00:03:55.980> an<00:03:56.209> abscess<00:03:57.209> is<00:03:57.449> a<00:03:57.480> fluid-filled

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
removal an abscess is a fluid-filled

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:00.740 
removal an abscess is a fluid-filled
pocket<00:03:59.069> and<00:03:59.280> it's<00:03:59.639> usually<00:04:00.060> filled<00:04:00.569> with

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
pocket and it's usually filled with

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.680 
pocket and it's usually filled with
bacteria<00:04:01.019> and<00:04:01.709> really<00:04:02.099> nasty<00:04:02.639> stuff<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.269> if

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
bacteria and really nasty stuff and if

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.479 
bacteria and really nasty stuff and if
it's<00:04:03.840> next<00:04:04.019> to<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:04.260> tonsils<00:04:04.799> it's<00:04:05.129> called<00:04:05.400> a

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
it's next to the tonsils it's called a

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.689 
it's next to the tonsils it's called a
peritonsillar<00:04:06.349> abscess<00:04:07.409> so<00:04:08.159> these<00:04:08.280> abscesses

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:08.699 
peritonsillar abscess so these abscesses

00:04:08.699 --> 00:04:10.580 
peritonsillar abscess so these abscesses
can<00:04:08.970> be<00:04:09.060> dangerous<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.690> can<00:04:10.019> lead<00:04:10.260> to<00:04:10.290> more

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
can be dangerous and can lead to more

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.619 
can be dangerous and can lead to more
severe<00:04:11.159> illnesses<00:04:11.790> such<00:04:12.000> as<00:04:12.060> sepsis

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:12.629 
severe illnesses such as sepsis

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:14.719 
severe illnesses such as sepsis
sometimes<00:04:13.440> they<00:04:13.560> can<00:04:13.709> be<00:04:13.799> drained<00:04:14.129> without

00:04:14.719 --> 00:04:14.729 
sometimes they can be drained without

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:17.029 
sometimes they can be drained without
removing<00:04:15.150> the<00:04:15.239> tonsils<00:04:15.629> but<00:04:15.810> many<00:04:16.289> times<00:04:16.560> this

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
removing the tonsils but many times this

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:17.899 
removing the tonsils but many times this
is<00:04:17.159> not<00:04:17.310> possible

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
is not possible

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.270 
is not possible
so<00:04:18.329> health<00:04:18.539> practitioners<00:04:19.229> opt<00:04:19.440> to<00:04:19.889> remove

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
so health practitioners opt to remove

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.089 
so health practitioners opt to remove
the<00:04:20.489> tonsils<00:04:21.019> and<00:04:22.019> really<00:04:22.289> a<00:04:22.320> final<00:04:22.710> reason

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
the tonsils and really a final reason

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.550 
the tonsils and really a final reason
and<00:04:23.400> it's<00:04:23.909> kind<00:04:24.180> of<00:04:24.240> an<00:04:24.360> umbrella<00:04:24.810> reason<00:04:25.380> is

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
and it's kind of an umbrella reason is

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.480 
and it's kind of an umbrella reason is
if<00:04:26.340> patients<00:04:26.969> are<00:04:27.090> having

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
if patients are having

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.570 
if patients are having
breathing<00:04:29.490> or<00:04:30.440> difficulty<00:04:31.440> eating<00:04:31.980> the

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
breathing or difficulty eating the

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.240 
breathing or difficulty eating the
tonsils<00:04:33.060> might<00:04:33.270> be<00:04:33.450> removed<00:04:33.810> the<00:04:34.680> idea<00:04:34.950> is<00:04:35.070> the

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
tonsils might be removed the idea is the

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:38.290 
tonsils might be removed the idea is the
tonsils<00:04:35.640> may<00:04:35.760> be<00:04:35.820> obstructing<00:04:36.540> the<00:04:36.990> food<00:04:37.560> or

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
tonsils may be obstructing the food or

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.270 
tonsils may be obstructing the food or
obstructing<00:04:39.300> proper<00:04:40.020> breathing<00:04:40.260> for<00:04:40.920> example

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
obstructing proper breathing for example

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.560 
obstructing proper breathing for example
if<00:04:41.460> you<00:04:41.550> look<00:04:41.670> at<00:04:41.730> these<00:04:41.850> adenoids

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
if you look at these adenoids

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.440 
if you look at these adenoids
they<00:04:43.080> might<00:04:43.290> swell<00:04:43.740> up<00:04:43.950> to<00:04:44.220> sizes<00:04:45.030> that<00:04:45.360> are

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
they might swell up to sizes that are

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.390 
they might swell up to sizes that are
just<00:04:45.600> way<00:04:45.870> too<00:04:45.930> big<00:04:46.350> and<00:04:46.590> obstruct<00:04:47.250> the<00:04:47.370> flow

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
just way too big and obstruct the flow

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.240 
just way too big and obstruct the flow
of<00:04:48.030> air<00:04:48.420> through<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.810> nasal<00:04:49.050> passage<00:04:49.560> so

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
of air through the nasal passage so

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:52.910 
of air through the nasal passage so
maybe<00:04:50.820> when<00:04:51.030> patients<00:04:51.450> lie<00:04:51.630> flat<00:04:51.930> they<00:04:52.560> can't

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
maybe when patients lie flat they can't

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.280 
maybe when patients lie flat they can't
breathe<00:04:53.340> air<00:04:53.700> in<00:04:53.970> as<00:04:54.330> well<00:04:54.630> and<00:04:54.900> this

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:55.290 
breathe air in as well and this

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.080 
breathe air in as well and this
sometimes<00:04:55.530> leads<00:04:55.920> to<00:04:56.010> issues<00:04:56.670> such<00:04:57.060> as

00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:57.090 
sometimes leads to issues such as

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:00.020 
sometimes leads to issues such as
obstructive<00:04:57.900> sleep<00:04:58.050> apnea<00:04:59.030> difficulty

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
obstructive sleep apnea difficulty

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.150 
obstructive sleep apnea difficulty
breathing<00:05:00.390> while<00:05:00.840> sleeping<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.500> so<00:05:01.950> some

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
breathing while sleeping and so some

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.590 
breathing while sleeping and so some
patients<00:05:02.280> who<00:05:02.610> have<00:05:02.700> difficulty<00:05:03.300> breathing

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
patients who have difficulty breathing

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.170 
patients who have difficulty breathing
may<00:05:04.380> have<00:05:04.650> the<00:05:04.830> adenoids<00:05:05.310> and<00:05:05.430> the<00:05:05.730> tonsils

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
may have the adenoids and the tonsils

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.290 
may have the adenoids and the tonsils
removed<00:05:06.620> now<00:05:07.620> after<00:05:08.250> the<00:05:08.370> surgery<00:05:08.550> people

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
removed now after the surgery people

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.020 
removed now after the surgery people
often<00:05:09.600> wonder<00:05:09.750> when<00:05:10.710> can<00:05:10.980> I<00:05:11.070> actually<00:05:11.340> eat

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
often wonder when can I actually eat

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.360 
often wonder when can I actually eat
when<00:05:12.990> can<00:05:13.230> I<00:05:13.290> have<00:05:13.320> that<00:05:13.680> nice<00:05:13.890> juicy<00:05:14.340> burger

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
when can I have that nice juicy burger

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.090 
when can I have that nice juicy burger
again<00:05:14.790> or<00:05:15.510> maybe<00:05:15.900> a<00:05:15.990> delicious<00:05:16.470> salad<00:05:16.770> or

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.100 
again or maybe a delicious salad or

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.370 
again or maybe a delicious salad or
grilled<00:05:17.310> chicken<00:05:17.370> right<00:05:17.970> well<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:19.050> really

grilled chicken right well it really

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:20.840 
grilled chicken right well it really
depends<00:05:19.830> on<00:05:19.950> what<00:05:20.160> the<00:05:20.370> health<00:05:20.640> practitioner

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850 
depends on what the health practitioner

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:24.050 
depends on what the health practitioner
or<00:05:21.510> the<00:05:21.630> surgeon<00:05:21.870> says<00:05:22.410> but<00:05:23.190> generally<00:05:23.820> it's

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
or the surgeon says but generally it's

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.360 
or the surgeon says but generally it's
about<00:05:24.240> two<00:05:24.870> weeks<00:05:25.140> before<00:05:25.380> a<00:05:25.650> patient<00:05:26.190> makes

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
about two weeks before a patient makes

about two weeks before a patient makes
full<00:05:26.700> recovery<00:05:27.240> maybe<00:05:27.810> ten<00:05:28.200> days<00:05:28.230> to<00:05:28.590> two

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:28.620 
full recovery maybe ten days to two

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:30.830 
full recovery maybe ten days to two
weeks<00:05:28.950> but<00:05:29.700> patients<00:05:30.180> who<00:05:30.300> actually<00:05:30.480> have<00:05:30.810> a
