again<00:00:00.480> I<00:00:00.599> can't<00:00:00.840> teach<00:00:01.050> you<00:00:01.079> much<00:00:01.380> about<00:00:01.620> clock

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
again I can't teach you much about clock

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:04.550 
again I can't teach you much about clock
repair<00:00:02.610> in<00:00:02.820> a<00:00:03.149> short<00:00:03.419> clip<00:00:03.689> but<00:00:04.080> we<00:00:04.170> can<00:00:04.350> talk

repair in a short clip but we can talk

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.320 
repair in a short clip but we can talk
for<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.859> minute<00:00:04.950> about<00:00:05.190> why<00:00:05.520> a<00:00:05.549> clock<00:00:05.910> may<00:00:06.120> not

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
for a minute about why a clock may not

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.890 
for a minute about why a clock may not
be<00:00:06.600> running<00:00:06.870> seems<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:08.639> as<00:00:09.150> I'm<00:00:09.360> doing<00:00:09.540> clock

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
be running seems in as I'm doing clock

repair<00:00:10.260> work<00:00:10.500> people<00:00:10.769> are<00:00:10.950> often<00:00:11.309> surprised

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
repair work people are often surprised

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.060 
repair work people are often surprised
even<00:00:12.150> angry<00:00:12.840> if<00:00:12.960> their<00:00:13.110> clock<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.559> stopped<00:00:13.830> and

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
even angry if their clock is stopped and

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.740 
even angry if their clock is stopped and
I<00:00:14.429> asked<00:00:14.730> well<00:00:14.910> when's<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.269> last<00:00:15.299> time<00:00:15.540> you

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
I asked well when's the last time you

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.810 
I asked well when's the last time you
had<00:00:15.870> it<00:00:15.900> serviced<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.680> oh<00:00:16.980> we've<00:00:17.369> never<00:00:17.609> had

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
had it serviced and oh we've never had

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.340 
had it serviced and oh we've never had
to<00:00:18.000> have<00:00:18.150> this<00:00:18.330> service<00:00:18.720> this<00:00:18.869> clocks<00:00:19.140> been

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
to have this service this clocks been

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.830 
to have this service this clocks been
perfect<00:00:19.920> for<00:00:20.100> years<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:21.240> explains<00:00:21.600> why

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
perfect for years and that explains why

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.870 
perfect for years and that explains why
it<00:00:21.990> stopped<00:00:22.320> now<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.980> can't<00:00:23.220> if<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.580> think

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
it stopped now you can't if you think

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.519 
it stopped now you can't if you think
about<00:00:24.000> your<00:00:24.330> car<00:00:24.570> you<00:00:24.810> wouldn't<00:00:25.080> brag<00:00:25.289> about

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
about your car you wouldn't brag about

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:26.810 
about your car you wouldn't brag about
the<00:00:25.800> fact<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.099> you<00:00:26.250> haven't<00:00:26.460> changed<00:00:26.609> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
the fact that you haven't changed the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.560 
the fact that you haven't changed the
oil<00:00:26.849> in<00:00:27.269> ten<00:00:27.869> years<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:29.010> this<00:00:29.970> clock<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.539> a

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
oil in ten years you this clock is a

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.359 
oil in ten years you this clock is a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
and they require service in this case

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.110 
and they require service in this case
particularly<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.430> fairly<00:00:35.790> primitive

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
particularly it's a fairly primitive

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.020 
particularly it's a fairly primitive
machine<00:00:37.050> without<00:00:37.649> sealed<00:00:38.250> bearings<00:00:38.820> without

a lot of fancy technology to keep it

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.299 
a lot of fancy technology to keep it
running<00:00:42.120> really<00:00:42.540> unlike<00:00:43.440> your<00:00:43.620> refrigerator

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
running really unlike your refrigerator

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:46.580

or or other appliance in your house
which<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> much<00:00:47.309> more<00:00:47.520> modern<00:00:47.760> construction

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
which is a much more modern construction

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.930 
which is a much more modern construction
they<00:00:48.960> need<00:00:49.170> service<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.800> they<00:00:50.100> will<00:00:50.129> stop<00:00:50.640> if

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
they need service and they will stop if

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.450 
they need service and they will stop if
they<00:00:51.480> become<00:00:51.899> dirty<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.590> worn<00:00:52.890> which<00:00:53.280> is

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
they become dirty and worn which is

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.299 
they become dirty and worn which is
usually<00:00:54.360> why<00:00:54.539> they<00:00:54.780> aren't<00:00:54.989> running<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:56.100> have

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
usually why they aren't running you have

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.979 
usually why they aren't running you have
issues<00:00:56.760> here<00:00:56.789> where<00:00:57.180> all<00:00:57.300> of<00:00:57.480> these<00:00:57.629> shafts

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
issues here where all of these shafts

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.229 
issues here where all of these shafts
are<00:00:58.469> turning<00:00:58.920> inside<00:00:59.039> bearings<00:00:59.760> which<00:00:59.969> really

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
are turning inside bearings which really

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.819 
are turning inside bearings which really
are<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.449> holes<00:01:00.870> drilled<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.530> front

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
are just holes drilled in the front

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.740 
are just holes drilled in the front
plate<00:01:02.070> of<00:01:02.219> the<00:01:02.340> movement<00:01:02.760> those<00:01:03.210> holes<00:01:03.510> can

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
plate of the movement those holes can

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.509 
plate of the movement those holes can
get<00:01:03.899> worn<00:01:04.170> egg-shaped<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.189> from<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
get worn egg-shaped just from the

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.820 
get worn egg-shaped just from the
pressure<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.270> dirt<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.720> eventually<00:01:07.710> if

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
pressure and the dirt and eventually if

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.440 
pressure and the dirt and eventually if
they're<00:01:07.979> worn<00:01:08.220> egg-shaped<00:01:08.729> enough<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.210> gears

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
they're worn egg-shaped enough the gears

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.810 
they're worn egg-shaped enough the gears
don't<00:01:09.630> mesh<00:01:09.750> properly<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.890> clock<00:01:11.189> stops<00:01:11.520> and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
don't mesh properly the clock stops and

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.670 
don't mesh properly the clock stops and
then<00:01:12.270> someone<00:01:12.720> like<00:01:12.750> me<00:01:13.080> has<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.320> do<00:01:13.500> what's

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
then someone like me has to do what's

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.550 
then someone like me has to do what's
called<00:01:13.830> bushing<00:01:14.400> where<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.909> put<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.560> sleeve

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
called bushing where you put a sleeve

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.440 
called bushing where you put a sleeve
back<00:01:16.950> in<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.340> worn<00:01:17.610> bearing<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.330> it

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
back in that worn bearing so that it

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.289 
back in that worn bearing so that it
turns<00:01:18.689> properly<00:01:19.290> also<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> just<00:01:20.520> dirt<00:01:20.820> builds

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
turns properly also to just dirt builds

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.359 
turns properly also to just dirt builds
up<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:22.020> all<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.380> these<00:01:22.530> bearings<00:01:22.979> they<00:01:23.100> start

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
up in all of these bearings they start

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.190 
up in all of these bearings they start
out<00:01:23.490> with<00:01:23.549> a<00:01:23.670> little<00:01:23.970> bit<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.119> oil<00:01:24.390> it's<00:01:24.840> open

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
out with a little bit of oil it's open

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.289 
out with a little bit of oil it's open
to<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.439> air<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:26.070> oil<00:01:26.280> dries<00:01:26.700> thickens

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
to the air the oil dries thickens

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.760 
to the air the oil dries thickens
collects<00:01:27.689> dirt<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.200> you<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.500> too<00:01:28.650> much

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
collects dirt and you have too much

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.770 
collects dirt and you have too much
friction<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.670> go<00:01:29.850> so<00:01:30.450> you<00:01:30.509> talk<00:01:30.750> about

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
friction for it to go so you talk about

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.440 
friction for it to go so you talk about
clock<00:01:31.350> cleaning<00:01:31.950> but<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.549> really<00:01:32.790> isn't<00:01:33.060> as

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
clock cleaning but that really isn't as

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.270 
clock cleaning but that really isn't as
significant<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.170> what<00:01:34.350> has<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.740> happen<00:01:34.770> where

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
significant as what has to happen where

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.890 
significant as what has to happen where
the<00:01:35.369> clock<00:01:35.579> has<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.060> taken<00:01:36.270> apart<00:01:36.479> and

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
the clock has to get taken apart and

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.200 
the clock has to get taken apart and

issue<00:01:39.570> too<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.079> pendulum<00:01:40.530> clocks<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:41.070> uneven

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
issue too with pendulum clocks is uneven

issue too with pendulum clocks is uneven
ticking<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.299> have<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.229> machine<00:01:43.619> here<00:01:43.920> that

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
ticking I have a machine here that

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.639 
ticking I have a machine here that
amplifies<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.149> tick<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:46.049> now<00:01:46.229> even<00:01:46.560> this

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
amplifies the tick right now even this

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.440 
amplifies the tick right now even this
is<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> little<00:01:46.979> bit<00:01:47.399> out<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.670> beat<00:01:47.880> but<00:01:48.119> probably

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
is a little bit out of beat but probably

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.080 
is a little bit out of beat but probably
still<00:01:48.689> working<00:01:49.220> if<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.310> listen<00:01:50.670> closely<00:01:50.880> you

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
still working if you listen closely you

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.810 
still working if you listen closely you
hear<00:01:51.299> a<00:01:51.329> short<00:01:51.659> in<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.780> long<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:55.460> can<00:01:56.460> make<00:01:56.640> that

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
hear a short in the long I can make that

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.190 
hear a short in the long I can make that
worse<00:01:57.119> by<00:01:57.810> unlevel<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.770> clock<00:01:59.299> if<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.509> level

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
worse by unlevel in the clock if I level

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.560 
worse by unlevel in the clock if I level
it<00:02:01.290> better<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.649> get<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> nice<00:02:02.100> even<00:02:02.430> tick<00:02:02.880> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it better I get a nice even tick the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.240 
it better I get a nice even tick the
clocks<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.049> beat<00:02:04.259> and<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.530> will<00:02:04.619> keep<00:02:04.799> running

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
clocks in beat and it will keep running

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.010 
clocks in beat and it will keep running
many<00:02:05.790> times<00:02:06.090> particularly<00:02:06.509> with<00:02:06.780> newer

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
many times particularly with newer

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.199 
many times particularly with newer
pendulum<00:02:07.649> clocks<00:02:07.950> if<00:02:08.190> they're<00:02:08.610> out<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.819> beat

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
pendulum clocks if they're out of beat

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.479 
pendulum clocks if they're out of beat
that's<00:02:09.629> the<00:02:09.869> only<00:02:10.170> problem<00:02:10.319> and<00:02:10.800> neither<00:02:11.340> you

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
that's the only problem and neither you

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.670 
that's the only problem and neither you
level<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.910> clock<00:02:12.150> or<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.660> in<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:13.020> adjust

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
level the clock or you in just adjust

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.039 
level the clock or you in just adjust
internally<00:02:14.370> so<00:02:14.849> the<00:02:14.969> clock<00:02:15.209> is<00:02:15.450> ticking

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
internally so the clock is ticking

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.500 
internally so the clock is ticking
evenly
