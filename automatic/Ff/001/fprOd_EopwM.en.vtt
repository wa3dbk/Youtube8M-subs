00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:21.000
 it is beautiful to all the boys I am 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.400
 video games tutorial that I'm here today with 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.529
 a new video to show you how 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:33.300
 become invisible to other players e 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:35.670
 become immortal with a simple 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:41.239
 then gloss the map point e 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.239
 let's look at this where I am 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.670
 and here once we are here it will be 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:57.960
 very easy we enter this way 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:59.610
 we climb over the moretto then rewards 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.730
 a square to go up here and we have to 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.949
 walk a little while on the wall e 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.600
 then make square and you will see that 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:12.060
 we will enter inside right inside 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:17.219
 the structure and our friend do not 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:22.560
 he can shoot and I wo n't see him instead 

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:26.700
 I can shoot it perfectly and here it is 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.609
 that I killed him and this blitz is it 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.130
 you can even use a 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.729
 deathmatch deathmatch that was 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.039
 verified by the rock star this death 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.670
 match is called we waited a moment 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:50.249
 union if I'm not mistaken unions e 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:53.240
 heavenly as you see in the video I don't 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:53.240
 he can kill 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:01.820
 I, on the other hand, loved it with one shot 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.179
 here and now I'll show you how 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.950
 take advantage of the death match will be the same 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:11.540
 but for safety 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:19.280
 I'll show you the match then 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:19.790
 it calls paradisiacal union and now puts 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.480
 pause 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:26.599
 until the invited players arrive 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.630
 so at least I'll show you a little 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.680
 click will be equal yes but it will not change 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.690
 nothing 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.989
 so now he pauses for a moment a 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.989
 soon 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.299
 and here we are well found with the 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.190
 deathmatch 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:47.840
 now I'll show you a little the click is 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:52.690
 equal yes but no there are just there 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:59.319
 enemies on the side of the wall then 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.319
 let's hope they don't kill me then here 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:16.180
 ah here is thank goodness it's still there will be 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:22.000
 easy to climb over the wall as 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:26.280
 done first then we get on this other 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.770
 moretto we pass on the wall and then 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.530
 we climb over here and we will enter the wall 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.770
 invisible and as you can see it will not be able to 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.290
 kill our enemy 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.230
 but we can kill them all 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:46.020
 as often as we want 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:46.020
 and so here is another enemy 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.630
