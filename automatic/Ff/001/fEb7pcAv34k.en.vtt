00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.510
 the condiments ready for salads are 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.980
 very convenient but they are also very 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.690
 easy to prepare 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.639
 so why not do it alone with 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.080
 few and simple ingredients we can 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.580
 prepare excellent healthy food 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.310
 cohabiting for salads and vegetables 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.650
 without adding a lot of fat and sugar 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.510
 calories I show you my condiments 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.789
 the first is preferred based on yogurt 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.680
 with a few ingredients we prepare a 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.570
 very good creamy dressing 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.759
 let's start with a couple of tablespoons of 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.160
 fat-free white yogurt that 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.840
 we put in a bowl together admitted 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.640
 mashed avocado 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.320
 I crushed it with a fork but 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.809
 you can also use the mixer 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.879
 we mix everything well so that 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.700
 the lawyer releases his healthy fats 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.320
 making the mixture creamy and more beautiful 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.940
 Coliseum 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.860
 let's keep stirring until it does 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.260
 it becomes a foam and then we add 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.180
 of garlic about half a tablespoon of 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.460
 crushed garlic but if you prefer you can 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
 also use garlic powder and then 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.800
 add two tablespoons of juice 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.589
 lemon 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.570
 Now let's mix the sauce well 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.520
 the beautiful frothy and add some 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.080
 salt and a bit of pepper in the amount that 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.970
 we prefer 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.830
 I put a little salt in my palm 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.259
 of the hand because they hold it better 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.580
 and now the pepper as much as we want 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.670
 I grind it directly into the 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.229
 bowl and mix and it is practically 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.119
 ready 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.610
 we have a great sauce to put on 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.320
 vegetables or above salads 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.509
 if you want you can also add some 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.790
 herbs or spices for those sauces 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.490
 which you prefer a tablespoon of 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.220
 this sauce has only 15 calories and from 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.840
 the second is creamy and delicious 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.880
 condiment involves the use of a 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.250
 an unusual homogenized ingredient 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.020
 carrot sounds funny but it is 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.299
 simply cooked carrots that 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.940
 they form an excellent puree to prepare 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.710
 good and healthy condiments 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.900
 we can use a glass for 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.970
 let's take the homogenized family 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.670
 with carrots and put it in the glass 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.470
 for smoothies by cleaning the jar well e 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.860
 then we provide a couple of tablespoons of 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.050
 rice vinegar now a small drop of 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.910
 oil to make the sauce creamier and 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.350
 to make the ingredients come true 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.300
 amalgamate better 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.150
 then add a quarter of a spoon 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:17.750
 you can use it fresh dry 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.810
 I have now added of the third century and 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.460
 finally put a little salt I measure it 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:26.470
 with the palm of his hand as he did 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.970
 first and some fresh peppercorns 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.920
 now let's put the lid on the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.810
 container paying attention to 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.140
 close it to perfection and mix 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.450
 the sauce is a very good condiment 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.030
 sweet and with a splendid color to combine 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.500
 to salads again we have only 15 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.500
 calories in a tablespoon of sauce
