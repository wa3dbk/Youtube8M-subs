I<00:00:46.800> pulled<00:00:47.129> this<00:00:47.250> out<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.730> had<00:00:47.910> used<00:00:48.149> this<00:00:48.270> in

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
I pulled this out and I had used this in

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.630 
I pulled this out and I had used this in
the<00:00:48.510> past<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.020> test<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.469> just<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:50.160> check<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.520> out

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the past to test it just to check it out

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.310 
the past to test it just to check it out
and<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.539> know<00:00:51.629> work<00:00:51.840> well<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.140> everything

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320

actually<00:00:53.820> went<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:54.570> use<00:00:54.809> it<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
actually went to actually use it and

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.310 
actually went to actually use it and
guess<00:00:56.129> what<00:00:56.250> epic<00:00:57.090> fail<00:00:57.360> now<00:00:57.960> I'm<00:00:58.140> actually

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.929 
broke off and like I said it was the
first<00:01:46.470> time<00:01:46.740> i've<00:01:46.920> ever<00:01:46.950> tried<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.549> actually

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
first time i've ever tried to actually

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.980 
first time i've ever tried to actually
use<00:01:48.119> this<00:01:48.329> and<00:01:48.600> how<00:01:50.630> depressing<00:01:51.630> was<00:01:51.780> that

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
use this and how depressing was that

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.249 
use this and how depressing was that
right<00:01:52.820> so<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.509> now<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.869> basically

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
right so and it now it's basically

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.569 
right so and it now it's basically
pretty<00:01:55.470> useless<00:01:55.710> because<00:01:55.979> there's<00:01:56.219> really<00:01:56.399> no

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
pretty useless because there's really no

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.249 
pretty useless because there's really no
way<00:01:56.610> to<00:01:56.729> get<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.090> back<00:01:57.299> on<00:01:57.450> securely<00:01:57.930> and

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
way to get that back on securely and

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.980 
way to get that back on securely and
this<00:01:59.009> thing<00:01:59.159> won't<00:01:59.310> even<00:01:59.520> close<00:01:59.850> now<00:02:00.149> without

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
this thing won't even close now without

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.380 
this thing won't even close now without
this<00:02:01.140> little<00:02:01.380> tab<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.920> lock<00:02:02.610> it<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> top

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
this little tab to lock it on to the top

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.330 
this little tab to lock it on to the top
there<00:02:05.000> of<00:02:06.000> course<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.450> can<00:02:06.630> just<00:02:06.899> take<00:02:07.079> your

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
there of course you can just take your

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.529 
there of course you can just take your
knife<00:02:08.340> and

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
knife and

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.569

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:11.579 
scratch on that there and can't really

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:13.429 
scratch on that there and can't really
do<00:02:11.760> a<00:02:11.790> one<00:02:12.060> hand<00:02:12.269> the<00:02:12.450> camera<00:02:12.750> bite<00:02:12.930> you<00:02:13.200> hit<00:02:13.319> it
