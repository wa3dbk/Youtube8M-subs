Roger crying this is too big there's all
these<00:01:37.200> people<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> middle<00:01:37.680> the<00:01:37.920> street

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
these people in the middle the street

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.030 
these people in the middle the street
there's<00:01:38.820> all<00:01:38.910> these<00:01:39.000> people<00:01:39.180> living<00:01:39.540> here<00:01:41.450> but

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
there's all these people living here but

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.170 
there's all these people living here but
I'm<00:01:44.040> realizing

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:47.180 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.770 

I'm<00:01:47.720> just<00:01:47.990> upset<00:01:48.320> because<00:01:48.350> I<00:01:48.860> know<00:01:48.980> that

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:49.780 
I'm just upset because I know that

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.820 
I'm just upset because I know that

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:51.830 
probably the reason that he did resign

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.090 
probably the reason that he did resign
is<00:01:52.280> for<00:01:53.270> his<00:01:53.420> health<00:01:53.600> issues<00:01:53.930> and<00:01:54.380> and<00:01:54.710> health

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
is for his health issues and and health

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:03.030 
is for his health issues and and health
reasons<00:01:55.610> and<00:01:56.020> they<00:01:57.020> just<00:01:57.290> hope<00:01:57.410> he's<00:01:57.560> okay
