00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.290
 today we are on a circuit 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.660
 we launched an operation 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.800
 extremely innovative and courageous for 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.740
 to get closer to our customers 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.070
 indeed we have conducted tests 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.869
 on five vehicle brands and on 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.000
 fifteen vehicles in total of twelve 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.820
 tons of 19 tons and tractors 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.489
 to measure consumption 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.500
 relative between each other 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:40.290
 following the transition to the new standards 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.309
 euro 6 with the arrival of the euro 6 we have 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.329
 faced with a lot of questions 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.260
 we already own 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.719
 and then even our customers have us 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.010
 questioned about the consequences of 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.140
 the arrival of this technology and 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.960
 the impact it's seeing her both on 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.390
 the sure blow the consumption and then on 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.739
 operating complexity and very 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.449
 honestly a few months ago we 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.870
 was not able to answer that 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.539
 question 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.449
 so we implemented a series 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.110
 of consumption tests to answer to 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.000
 that question 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.220
 we've been talking about it for a long time 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.270
 has no technical element very 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.950
 clearly if that's what we 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.570
 tell the builders there we have a 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.820
 true laboratory we really arrive 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.750
 will finally know the ponds the 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.299
 outs on consumption 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.619
 announced his first time I prove 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.560
 actually see all together and 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.350
 especially having a 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.770
 a bit of a unanimous opinion about 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.390
 brands 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.470
 that's why I wanted to come because 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.570
 that indeed could have a 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:29.500
 vision a little more a little more general 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.939
 and a little wider 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.869
 kind of everything that came out 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:33.869
 today he succeeds 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.570
 today fraikin is acquiring a new 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.590
 asset Fraikin lab will do sofa 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.360
 what is it just 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.710
 fraikin lab in the dna of 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.360
 fraikin for 70 years 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.280
 every time we study a mission 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.300
 for a customer we will compare the 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.700
 available materials 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.740
 we will give meaning to all of our 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.930
 studies we will be able to test 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.729
 materials and we will also find 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.590
 innovative solutions and well our 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.030
 goal is to reinvent the way 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.410
 which free a job by equipping itself 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.970
 a structure capable of synthesizing 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.780
 for more customers so much 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.700
 more obvious 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.369
 the whole work that is done by 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.840
 the whole team fraikin I 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.390
 click on tech engine duo frictions 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.250
 I know the vehicle so we 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.410
 did a series of tests of course 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.290
 of consumption these tests were conducted 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.209
 by dekra who has certified tests and 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.670
 yes the big the great teaching of 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.010
 that this day is there to 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.750
 significant differences depending on 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.450
 use according to the mission 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.310
 and depending on the models on the 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.080
 consumption and it was really this 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.790
 we tried to understand what 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.129
 would be the differences depending on the 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.750
 different vehicles to be able to 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.450
 recommended to our customers good vehicle 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.620
 adapted to the right mission our customers 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.910
 are hugely waiting 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.769
 information about this news 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.239
 euro6 technologies in France 

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:54.730
 but also abroad you have to know 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.140
 that fraikin said country in addition to the 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.660
 France we have fifteen thousand trucks 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:59.950
 which turns out of France and it's for 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.180
 what this event we want him 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:03.069
 also give a twist 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.870
 international because they are really 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.709
 in this search for information to 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.879
 across europe 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:12.160
 it's the euro 6 standard if we plan 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.450
 fraikin in the future listen it's a 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.650
 growth project for the for the 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.290
 France over the next three years 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.790
 with a very clear strategy 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.650
 bring closer and closer to our 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.239
 customers the tests we have leads 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.870
 today is what we have 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.670
 ad 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.220
 that is, setting up 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.569
 reinforced consulting services are going 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:30.280
 take day in the next 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.349
 weeks and we are very confident 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.910
 on the fact that if we go 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:37.590
 answer questions and challenge 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.590
 legitimate that poses us naked
