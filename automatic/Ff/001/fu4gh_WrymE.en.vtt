52.0 refine the last 1.03 nine that's
what<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.100> is<00:00:50.309> there<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:51.059> when<00:00:51.300> I<00:00:51.329> got<00:00:51.539> my

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
what that is there is when I got my

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.020 
what that is there is when I got my
green<00:00:52.110> bag<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.800> orange<00:00:53.100> bag<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> strobe<00:00:53.699> stars

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
green bag and orange bag a strobe stars

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.880 
green bag and orange bag a strobe stars
mixed<00:00:54.360> up<00:00:54.480> together<00:00:54.629> I<00:00:54.899> know<00:00:55.260> what's<00:00:55.500> bad<00:00:55.710> guy

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
mixed up together I know what's bad guy

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.049 
mixed up together I know what's bad guy
dumped<00:00:56.160> into<00:00:56.280> which<00:00:56.550> but<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.789> got<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> whole

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
dumped into which but I got a whole

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.810 
dumped into which but I got a whole
bunch<00:00:57.210> of<00:00:57.360> stars<00:00:57.600> for<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:57.899> mix<00:00:58.370> so<00:00:59.370> basically

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
bunch of stars for the mix so basically

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.279 
bunch of stars for the mix so basically
those<00:01:00.059> first<00:01:00.329> two<00:01:00.480> heads<00:01:00.660> will<00:01:00.840> probably<00:01:01.170> be

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
those first two heads will probably be

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.959 
those first two heads will probably be
the<00:01:01.410> same<00:01:01.440> now<00:01:01.770> these<00:01:01.949> are<00:01:02.129> two<00:01:02.160> one-pound

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
the same now these are two one-pound

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.479 
the same now these are two one-pound
dual<00:01:03.960> no<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.320> one<00:01:04.470> pound<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.890> yes<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.280> one

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
dual no the one pound is yes to one

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:30.080 
dual no the one pound is yes to one
pound<00:01:05.700> us<00:01:05.909> all<00:01:06.390> black<00:01:06.720> powder<00:01:28.610> a<00:01:29.610> couple

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
pound us all black powder a couple

flashes<00:01:30.479> on<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.630> ground<00:01:30.900> but<00:01:30.990> not<00:01:31.110> much<00:01:31.320> I

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
flashes on the ground but not much I

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.499 
flashes on the ground but not much I
think<00:01:32.250> maybe<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.670> the<00:01:32.790> cross<00:01:33.000> sets<00:01:33.240> that<00:01:33.329> might

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
think maybe on the cross sets that might

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.940 
think maybe on the cross sets that might
tip<00:01:33.659> a<00:01:33.720> little<00:01:33.960> bit<00:01:34.049> more<00:01:34.200> vertical<00:01:34.650> shoot<00:01:34.829> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
tip a little bit more vertical shoot the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.050 
tip a little bit more vertical shoot the
next<00:01:35.070> one<00:01:35.340> then<00:01:35.520> we'll<00:01:35.640> shoot<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.909> first

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
next one then we'll shoot the first

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.260 
next one then we'll shoot the first
cross<00:01:36.299> set<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.659> see<00:01:36.750> what<00:01:36.869> happens<00:01:38.150> at<00:01:39.150> the

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
cross set and see what happens at the

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.679 
cross set and see what happens at the
moment<00:01:42.649> I<00:01:43.790> know<00:01:44.790> right<00:01:45.060> in<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.210> wrong<00:01:45.360> spot

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
moment I know right in the wrong spot

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.999 
moment I know right in the wrong spot
half<00:01:48.170> angle<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.229> rack<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.590> shoot<00:01:49.770> them<00:01:49.860> over

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
half angle the rack and shoot them over

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.899 
half angle the rack and shoot them over
this<00:01:50.130> way<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.280> just<00:01:53.430> turn<00:01:53.610> your<00:01:53.790> rap

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
this way you can just turn your rap

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.889 
this way you can just turn your rap
right<00:01:54.200> yeah<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:56.240> mean<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.329> probably<00:01:57.479> should<00:01:57.780> be

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
right yeah I mean you probably should be

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.240 
right yeah I mean you probably should be
shooting<00:01:58.200> down<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.500> long<00:01:58.680> distance<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.159> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
shooting down the long distance of the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:03.440 
shooting down the long distance of the
field<00:01:59.460> anyway<00:02:02.210> everything<00:02:03.210> is<00:02:03.299> breaking

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
field anyway everything is breaking

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:17.240 
field anyway everything is breaking
right<00:02:03.780> in<00:02:03.930> front<00:02:04.110> of<00:02:04.170> the<00:02:04.259> moon<00:02:15.980> go<00:02:16.980> for<00:02:17.160> the

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
right in front of the moon go for the

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:29.000 
right in front of the moon go for the
first<00:02:17.489> percent<00:02:18.060> right<00:02:27.440> angle<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.530> rack<00:02:28.739> time

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
first percent right angle the rack time

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.500 
first percent right angle the rack time
turn<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.520> rack<00:02:29.670> let's<00:02:29.910> see<00:02:30.060> where<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.300> first

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
turn the rack let's see where the first

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.479 
turn the rack let's see where the first
one<00:02:30.660> goes<00:02:30.870> I'll<00:02:31.560> go<00:02:31.739> out<00:02:31.890> there<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:32.220> help<00:02:32.310> with

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
one goes I'll go out there and help with

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.369 
one goes I'll go out there and help with
changes<00:02:32.910> around<00:02:33.180> see<00:02:33.660> how<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:33.930> goes<00:02:34.140> to

00:02:34.369 --> 00:02:34.379 
changes around see how it goes to

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:36.229 
changes around see how it goes to
relation<00:02:35.280> to<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.489> ground<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.849> might<00:02:36.030> have<00:02:36.120> to

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
relation to the ground I might have to

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:49.339 
relation to the ground I might have to
set<00:02:36.420> more<00:02:36.599> vertical<00:02:37.489> every<00:02:38.489> Sheldon

00:02:49.339 --> 00:02:49.349

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
go for the next one our back time Chris

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.580 
go for the next one our back time Chris
now<00:02:53.909> that<00:02:54.120> was<00:02:54.239> the<00:02:54.269> original<00:02:54.569> one<00:02:54.959> we<00:02:55.109> begin

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
now that was the original one we begin

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.619 
now that was the original one we begin
with<00:02:55.829> quick<00:02:56.040> timing

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
with quick timing

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:00.679 
with quick timing
leave<00:02:57.900> your<00:02:58.079> mind<00:02:58.819> now<00:02:59.819> go<00:03:00.030> for<00:03:00.209> the<00:03:00.299> next<00:03:00.480> one

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
leave your mind now go for the next one

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:03.940 
leave your mind now go for the next one
we'll<00:03:00.840> try<00:03:01.049> that<00:03:01.079> one

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.289 

I<00:03:06.739> tested<00:03:07.739> these<00:03:08.040> rondelle's<00:03:08.670> at<00:03:08.969> the<00:03:09.090> last

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
I tested these rondelle's at the last

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.509 
I tested these rondelle's at the last
hour<00:03:09.629> shoot<00:03:10.079> we<00:03:10.200> had<00:03:10.349> up<00:03:10.469> in<00:03:10.590> warrens<00:03:13.519> same

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
hour shoot we had up in warrens same

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:30.970 
hour shoot we had up in warrens same
thing<00:03:14.730> different<00:03:15.060> time<00:03:15.239> yeah
