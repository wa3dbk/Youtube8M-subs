00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.970
 has also made a few laughs 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.570
 Let's pills ourselves on something like that 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.130
 case 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.290
 Now I want to go first and 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.790
 though the good old gameplay became and 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.299
 a few others from the cuban warrior 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.100

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.950
 completed day is following youtuber

 or other people are marked 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.340
 will be asked to ask 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.259
 answer and that would be me 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.670
 like to do this way with you 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.470
 because I found him asking relatively 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.220
 interesting to me then has such a 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.200
 again the old ones 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.110
 childhood memory pulled up because like 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.340
 born 1985, it is already like that 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.409
 a couple of years ago that I'm on the 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.720
 world and my gaming time 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.060
 Fingers really early on resp 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.380
 they expire often did not matter 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.820
 but I do not think so much 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.590
 I 'll just come to the questions 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.990
 we ask one time is the way you are 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.340
 then gambled so I think so 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.159
 That's a bit of a question 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.680
 it's because you're so real 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.780
 extremely stalking has entered and that 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.550
 has been with me 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.110
 At that time you can not say next 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.580
 happened five years ago 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.160

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.900

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.110
 go get that yes call of 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.310
 duty was there was the century 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.690
 actually already born because I have 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.250

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.480
 always on the profile with gambled allowed 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.459
 but never allow heart 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.900
 yes that was then for me this state 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.340
 so call of duty mwp black ops 1 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.350
 I have the first time at my home 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.269
 really nice to gamble yes 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:48.800
 with which everyday his first game 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.470
 played now it starts as mine 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.519
 I have seven first gamer people at seven 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.950
 years played 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.019
 It was then in front of my auntie old 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:58.550
 game console when i say than i mean 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:02:59.600
 also old on this question I go the same 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.200
 is still one was my first 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.209
 game console yes so what was your first 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.709
 console and now it really comes 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.209
 I also google again 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:10.700
 People searched for this one 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:13.640
 small task for you I have this 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.440
 console not found mega drive directly 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:17.150
 one said hey people was again 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.019
 courageously honest my first winner 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.880
 It was about a small flat part with 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:24.769
 very many cables and the games were 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.230
 so really, how can you guess 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:29.239
 these pc's just imagine why diskettes 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.250
 a bit not so wide a bit 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.200
 narrower and they had like on one 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.959
 Handy card had the chip so to speak 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.060
 visible and that was my first 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:40.549
 console on the I rocked back then 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.070
 yes it was relatively early in the 90s thanks 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.100
 what was your first game it was the next one 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.750
 ask and yes my first two three 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.310
 Games I have to say that honestly 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.030
 I was extremely looking for this 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.070
 console 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.420
 The goods were so short-lived, I just have to 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:55.340
 I just say it all three 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.570
 must mention that is once such a 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.459
 Maybe the one or the other knows 

00:03:56.570 --> 00:04:00.380
 others are still from the mobile of you guys 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.060
 with the snail in the labyrinth and 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:04.670
 have to crawl outside that was that 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.040
 1 so really cool in this 2 engine 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.959
 then it was a motorcycle race so 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:10.579
 really as well as what eighth game is 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.170
 even better but so of the engine heavy 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.810
 what are used to the arcade and 

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:16.519
 a tennis game a tennis game where you 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:18.590
 with the bats so back and forth 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.880
 has gone and so has moved the ball 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.430
 Yes 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.140
 those were my first games what was 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.000
 your first game which we own 

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.980
 have bought money that this question can 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.480
 I really answer that too 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.360
 really cool so of course it was like that 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:32.950
 that at the time we were at nintendo 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.120
 yet these multi cassettes were used 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:35.440
 that means we are on the 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.330
 flea market or something like that 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:38.980
 from there Czechoslovakia and where too 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:41.110
 We always have these 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.180
 disks bought with 50 games on it 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.190
 and that costs at five mark 10 mark 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.130
 then all time and there you have then 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.980
 56 times great mario on it eighth time 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.600
 tetris pagnia games and so it was 

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:54.370
 relatively good offer 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:55.990
 yes and such a multicar sat that was 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.360
 first game which I bought then 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:01.450
 have and there I have super mario the 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.850
 first episode at that time really extreme 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.800
 rocked by yes but really extreme 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.360
 moved through and they really were 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.990
 the origins but as I said is the 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:10.270
 right one 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:11.530
 i need my right first console 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:12.880
 never really really say 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.680
 perceived as my first 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.210
 right console choice was the 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.460
 Playstation I have been extremely 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:20.980
 Death wanted searched by need for speed 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.750
 our title about gta so that was 

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.370
 really i believe the console the the 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.470
 Of course, most use now has 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.960
 followed by ps2 and ps3 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.490
 yes so i hope i could on this 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.760
 ask here as spontaneously as it actually 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.080
 always do relatively well for you 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.550
 but we have another one now 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.320
 little time left here from the gameplay 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:39.940
 that I still cover the last people 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.370
 Of course I can mention that now 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.780
 because it's natural for me to do that 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.310
 I can pass on questions 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.460
 first think about asking new ones 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.840
 can and should take or I do it 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:51.790
 not that means I keep the old ones 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.020
 ask and teddy here at this 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:54.940
 Just put a few of mine 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.040
 youtube colleagues where it me personally 

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.930
 really interested because one too 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.650
 few older semesters show younger than 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.190
 we really have everything there 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:05.590
 mixed video like the boys so ans 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.000
 gaming have arrived and now the 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:08.770
 first steps were related to 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.180
 console and go well but not so 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.010
 long you can find the whole but in and 

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.560
