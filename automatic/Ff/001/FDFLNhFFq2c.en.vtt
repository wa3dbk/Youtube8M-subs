back just place it onto the wet stone
itself<00:05:07.430> tilt<00:05:08.430> it<00:05:08.639> at<00:05:08.970> about<00:05:09.300> 20<00:05:09.990> degrees<00:05:10.349> now

00:05:11.089 --> 00:05:11.099 
itself tilt it at about 20 degrees now

00:05:11.099 --> 00:05:12.529 
itself tilt it at about 20 degrees now
that's<00:05:11.280> easier<00:05:11.610> said<00:05:11.669> than<00:05:12.000> actually<00:05:12.330> done

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:12.539 
that's easier said than actually done

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.020 
that's easier said than actually done
but<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.169> idea<00:05:13.530> is<00:05:13.590> that<00:05:13.680> that's<00:05:13.949> the<00:05:14.130> perfect

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
but the idea is that that's the perfect

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.540 
but the idea is that that's the perfect
way<00:05:15.449> to<00:05:15.509> sharpen<00:05:16.020> a<00:05:16.080> knife<00:05:16.110> and<00:05:16.830> with<00:05:17.039> gentle

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
way to sharpen a knife and with gentle

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.219 
way to sharpen a knife and with gentle
pressure<00:05:17.759> not<00:05:18.270> too<00:05:18.509> much<00:05:18.630> pressure<00:05:18.870> it<00:05:19.110> is

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
pressure not too much pressure it is

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.610 
pressure not too much pressure it is
just<00:05:19.440> to<00:05:19.590> work<00:05:19.800> the<00:05:20.009> knife<00:05:20.190> back<00:05:20.610> and<00:05:20.820> forth

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
just to work the knife back and forth

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:27.020 
just to work the knife back and forth
maybe<00:05:22.620> 30<00:05:22.949> 40<00:05:23.340> times<00:05:23.699> keeping<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.360> same<00:05:24.539> hand

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.850 

so<00:05:27.660> once<00:05:27.870> you've<00:05:27.990> done<00:05:28.170> this<00:05:28.320> two<00:05:28.590> or<00:05:28.680> three

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
so once you've done this two or three

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.370 
so once you've done this two or three
times<00:05:29.100> on<00:05:29.550> each<00:05:29.580> side<00:05:30.170> reducing<00:05:31.170> the<00:05:31.260> number

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
times on each side reducing the number

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:33.770 
times on each side reducing the number
of<00:05:31.560> times<00:05:31.770> you<00:05:31.950> do<00:05:32.130> it<00:05:32.160> each<00:05:32.430> time<00:05:32.460> the<00:05:33.390> life<00:05:33.570> of

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
of times you do it each time the life of

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.720 
of times you do it each time the life of
the<00:05:33.870> shop<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.950> best<00:05:35.130> thing<00:05:35.310> then<00:05:35.520> is

the shop the best thing then is

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:38.000 
the shop the best thing then is
obviously<00:05:36.090> we<00:05:36.240> get<00:05:36.420> rid<00:05:36.660> of<00:05:36.690> the<00:05:36.900> /<00:05:37.080> is<00:05:37.680> to<00:05:37.860> get

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.010 
obviously we get rid of the / is to get

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:39.860 
obviously we get rid of the / is to get
quite<00:05:38.250> a<00:05:38.280> strong<00:05:38.520> tea<00:05:38.760> towel<00:05:39.030> and<00:05:39.360> just<00:05:39.510> wipe
