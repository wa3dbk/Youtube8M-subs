you cover it so the wire will not get
fly<00:02:33.460> them<00:02:33.960> at<00:02:34.960> this<00:02:35.200> point<00:02:35.440> we're<00:02:35.680> going<00:02:35.770> to

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
fly them at this point we're going to

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.710 
fly them at this point we're going to
make<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.010> simple<00:02:36.430> loop<00:02:36.460> into<00:02:37.030> the<00:02:37.180> top<00:02:37.420> of<00:02:37.600> the

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
make a simple loop into the top of the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.190 
make a simple loop into the top of the
wire<00:02:38.160> and<00:02:39.160> you<00:02:39.520> need<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.970> keep<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.720> mind<00:02:40.930> which

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
wire and you need to keep in mind which

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.410 
wire and you need to keep in mind which
way<00:02:41.380> you<00:02:41.440> want<00:02:41.740> the<00:02:41.980> pendant<00:02:42.340> to<00:02:42.640> hang<00:02:43.000> if<00:02:43.300> I

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
way you want the pendant to hang if I

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.630 
way you want the pendant to hang if I
want<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.660> dependent<00:02:44.080> King<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.560> way<00:02:44.830> I<00:02:45.130> would

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
want to dependent King this way I would

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.940 
want to dependent King this way I would
make<00:02:45.850> the<00:02:46.000> loop<00:02:46.720> going<00:02:47.080> in<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.590> different

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
make the loop going in the different

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.360 
make the loop going in the different
direction<00:02:48.190> than<00:02:48.730> if<00:02:48.850> I<00:02:48.970> wanted<00:02:49.240> to<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:50.560> feed

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
direction than if I wanted to the feed

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.090 
direction than if I wanted to the feed
to<00:02:51.580> hang<00:02:51.790> in<00:02:52.030> this<00:02:52.180> direction<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.900> I<00:02:53.740> want<00:02:54.010> the

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
to hang in this direction so I want the

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.680 
to hang in this direction so I want the
bead<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.310> hang<00:02:54.610> in<00:02:54.730> this<00:02:54.820> direction<00:02:55.300> because<00:02:55.450> I

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
bead to hang in this direction because I

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.810 
bead to hang in this direction because I
like<00:02:55.900> the<00:02:56.080> way<00:02:56.200> it's<00:02:56.380> formed<00:02:56.830> so<00:02:57.490> I'm<00:02:57.580> going<00:02:57.760> to

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
like the way it's formed so I'm going to

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.840 
like the way it's formed so I'm going to
take<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:58.360> make<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.870> sideways<00:02:59.410> Bend<00:02:59.770> because<00:03:00.760> I

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
take and make a sideways Bend because I

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.470 
take and make a sideways Bend because I
want<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.180> loop<00:03:01.330> to<00:03:01.600> go<00:03:01.720> in<00:03:01.870> this<00:03:01.990> direction

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
want the loop to go in this direction

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.150 
want the loop to go in this direction
because<00:03:04.480> I<00:03:04.660> want<00:03:04.870> this<00:03:04.960> to<00:03:05.170> be<00:03:05.320> a<00:03:05.350> larger<00:03:05.920> loop

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
because I want this to be a larger loop

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.680 
because I want this to be a larger loop
I'm<00:03:06.670> going<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.970> leave<00:03:07.180> a<00:03:07.210> little<00:03:07.450> extra

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
I'm going to leave a little extra

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.870 
I'm going to leave a little extra
material<00:03:08.440> again<00:03:09.010> I'm<00:03:09.100> going<00:03:09.280> to<00:03:09.340> trim<00:03:09.550> off<00:03:09.700> the

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:09.880 
material again I'm going to trim off the

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:13.680 
material again I'm going to trim off the
excess<00:03:10.150> wire<00:03:11.520> and<00:03:12.520> then<00:03:13.030> use<00:03:13.060> their<00:03:13.480> round

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690 
excess wire and then use their round

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.560 
excess wire and then use their round
nose<00:03:13.900> pliers<00:03:14.230> I'm<00:03:14.890> going<00:03:15.130> to<00:03:15.190> use<00:03:15.370> the<00:03:15.640> larger

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
nose pliers I'm going to use the larger

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.320 
nose pliers I'm going to use the larger
portion<00:03:17.020> of<00:03:17.140> the<00:03:17.260> choir<00:03:17.530> to<00:03:17.890> make<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:18.370> the

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:19.330 
portion of the choir to make the the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:20.850 
portion of the choir to make the the
loop<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.960> way<00:03:20.110> it<00:03:20.230> will<00:03:20.350> have<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.500> larger

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
loop that way it will have a larger

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.160 
loop that way it will have a larger
circumference<00:03:21.540> put<00:03:22.540> it<00:03:22.630> right<00:03:22.780> on<00:03:22.900> the<00:03:23.050> edge

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
circumference put it right on the edge

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.400 
circumference put it right on the edge
of<00:03:23.380> the<00:03:23.500> wire<00:03:24.390> you<00:03:25.390> can<00:03:25.540> just<00:03:25.840> roll<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.230> wire

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:26.410 
of the wire you can just roll the wire

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.860 
of the wire you can just roll the wire
completely<00:03:27.070> over<00:03:30.420> reposition<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.510> hand<00:03:31.720> so

completely over reposition the hand so

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.080 
completely over reposition the hand so
it's<00:03:32.020> comfortable<00:03:32.280> and<00:03:33.280> continue<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.880> bend

it's comfortable and continue to bend

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.750 
it's comfortable and continue to bend
until<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.720> touches<00:03:35.250> you<00:03:36.250> might<00:03:36.430> want<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.640> take

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
until it touches you might want to take

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.430 
until it touches you might want to take
your<00:03:36.820> chain<00:03:37.150> nose<00:03:37.180> pliers<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:38.020> just<00:03:38.080> give<00:03:38.410> it

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
your chain nose pliers and just give it

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.200 
your chain nose pliers and just give it
a<00:03:38.560> little<00:03:38.770> squeeze<00:03:39.070> and<00:03:39.520> kind<00:03:39.790> of<00:03:39.820> straighten
