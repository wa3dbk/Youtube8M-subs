 Good morning guys, how are you? This email came to me from marvel706 concerning a 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:20.670
 video I had made at the time about editing the psn mail (playstation network) 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.980
 as for the playstation 3 of course ... So he asked me that he couldn't edit 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:35.640
 the account, in the sense of the Playstation network mail. I remember the change in the email 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:49.120
 does not change the username, it always remains the same. I photographed you as I modified 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:01:02.640
 mine, my playstation network in short. Practically going to the PlayStation Network which is located 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:12.250
 near the network right, there is Playstation network, account management will appear, by clicking 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:22.440
 on. No account management. After you have logged in, account management will appear. One time 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:29.530
 that you entered in, click on account management. Within account management appears 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:36.860
 account information. By clicking on account information, this photo appears here 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.539
 I'm showing you with billing details, access id, email address, password, 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:56.099
 name, address, avatar and profile. So by going to your email login ID, it will ask you 

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:04.470
 to enter the password, try entering the first password you put that makes you 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:20.980
 enter with the playstation network. You put it, enter it, click on continue, and this appears. 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:32.840
 To change go here, put another address and click on confirm. You should 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:40.670
 an inscription will come out asking you to confirm if you are sure or not and once this is done 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.210
 you can exit the playstation network, try to re-enter, re-enter the second one again 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:54.640
 email. Try to see if it works like this. I did the email modification 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:02.040
 only from PlayStation 3, I tried to do it from the official website of the Playstation but me 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:11.350
 from a playstation network error, so I don't know if it's a network problem or anything, 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:18.100
 of the playstation obviously, because on the internet it works. Try to see if it works e 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:25.000
 I hope the problem is solved. Thank you for your attention, best regards, 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.870
 Francis.
