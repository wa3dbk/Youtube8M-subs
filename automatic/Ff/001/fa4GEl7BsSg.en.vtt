in your survival game it's a it looks

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.250 
in your survival game it's a it looks
like<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.179> would<00:00:15.240> be<00:00:15.299> a<00:00:15.389> really<00:00:15.570> fun<00:00:15.690> mod<00:00:16.049> to

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
like it would be a really fun mod to

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.200 
like it would be a really fun mod to
just<00:00:16.470> play<00:00:16.650> through<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.880> got<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> lot<00:00:18.150> of

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
just play through it's got a lot of

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.150 
just play through it's got a lot of
simple<00:00:18.690> stuff<00:00:18.869> in<00:00:19.020> and<00:00:19.170> then<00:00:19.320> stuff<00:00:19.560> which

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
simple stuff in and then stuff which

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.460 
simple stuff in and then stuff which
would<00:00:20.279> be<00:00:20.400> harder<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.699> craft<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.390> no<00:00:22.170> endgame

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
would be harder to craft so no endgame

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.410 
would be harder to craft so no endgame
items<00:00:22.920> or<00:00:23.070> anything<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:23.400> that<00:00:23.550> but<00:00:23.970> we're

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
items or anything like that but we're

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.640 
items or anything like that but we're
going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> go<00:00:24.689> ahead<00:00:24.779> and<00:00:24.869> take<00:00:25.109> a<00:00:25.140> look<00:00:25.260> and

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
going to go ahead and take a look and

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
see how we do so alright the first thing

see how we do so alright the first thing
we're<00:00:28.859> going<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.039> be<00:00:29.250> taking<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.519> look<00:00:29.640> at<00:00:29.730> our

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
we're going to be taking a look at our

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.609 
we're going to be taking a look at our
the<00:00:30.060> blaze<00:00:30.269> tools<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.869> basically<00:00:31.199> these<00:00:31.470> are

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the blaze tools and basically these are

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.420 
the blaze tools and basically these are
all<00:00:31.769> crafted<00:00:32.219> using<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.440> fighter<00:00:34.770> charges<00:00:35.219> in

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
all crafted using the fighter charges in

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.160 
all crafted using the fighter charges in
blaze<00:00:35.790> rods<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.420> to<00:00:36.480> make<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.660> fighter<00:00:36.930> charge

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
blaze rods and to make a fighter charge

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.380 
blaze rods and to make a fighter charge
you<00:00:37.710> put<00:00:37.890> blaze<00:00:38.100> powder<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.550> top<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.910> coal<00:00:39.120> on

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
you put blaze powder on top of coal on

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.819 
you put blaze powder on top of coal on
top<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.750> gunpowder<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:40.440> will<00:00:40.559> give<00:00:40.590> you

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
top of gunpowder and that will give you

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.310 
top of gunpowder and that will give you
three<00:00:41.219> of<00:00:41.309> these<00:00:41.370> fighter<00:00:41.640> charges<00:00:42.079> these<00:00:43.079> are

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
three of these fighter charges these are

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.779 
three of these fighter charges these are
fairly<00:00:43.590> easy<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:44.100> make<00:00:44.250> i'm<00:00:44.430> not<00:00:44.579> sure<00:00:44.700> what

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
fairly easy to make i'm not sure what

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.369 
fairly easy to make i'm not sure what
their<00:00:44.969> durability<00:00:45.210> is<00:00:45.600> but<00:00:45.840> as<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.079> can<00:00:46.170> see

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
their durability is but as you can see

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.440 
their durability is but as you can see
they<00:00:46.530> look<00:00:46.710> pretty<00:00:46.890> cool<00:00:47.239> nothing<00:00:48.239> special

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
they look pretty cool nothing special

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.180 
they look pretty cool nothing special
about<00:00:48.780> them<00:00:49.020> no<00:00:49.200> special<00:00:49.530> powers<00:00:49.649> or<00:00:49.890> anything

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
about them no special powers or anything

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.840 
about them no special powers or anything
like<00:00:50.219> that<00:00:50.370> just<00:00:51.239> a<00:00:51.360> regular<00:00:51.480> tools<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.730> say<00:00:53.730> we

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
like that just a regular tools so say we

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.869 
like that just a regular tools so say we
can<00:00:53.969> go<00:00:54.030> ahead<00:00:54.090> and<00:00:54.180> test<00:00:54.390> out<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:55.260> shovel

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
can go ahead and test out this shovel

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:59.299 
can go ahead and test out this shovel
that's<00:00:56.879> not<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.239> great<00:00:57.949> alright<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
that's not that great alright so it

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.610 
that's not that great alright so it
seems<00:00:59.550> like<00:00:59.760> their<00:01:00.300> durability<00:01:00.620> would

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
seems like their durability would

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.160 
seems like their durability would
probably<00:01:01.980> be<00:01:02.129> fairly<00:01:02.609> good<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.629> there

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
probably be fairly good on in there

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.800 
probably be fairly good on in there
minding<00:01:04.439> speed<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.769> also<00:01:05.040> pretty<00:01:05.220> good<00:01:05.339> so

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
minding speed is also pretty good so

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.120 
minding speed is also pretty good so
moving<00:01:06.810> right<00:01:06.840> along<00:01:06.990> here<00:01:07.260> we<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.950> emerald

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
moving right along here we have emerald

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.760 
moving right along here we have emerald
tools<00:01:09.110> again<00:01:10.110> I'm<00:01:10.260> not<00:01:10.290> sure<00:01:10.500> about<00:01:10.619> these

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
tools again I'm not sure about these

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.370 
tools again I'm not sure about these
durability<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.430> because<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:12.150> spoiler<00:01:13.049> didn't

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
durability is because the spoiler didn't

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.980 
durability is because the spoiler didn't
really<00:01:13.560> show<00:01:13.770> much<00:01:14.299> as<00:01:15.299> far<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.659> how<00:01:15.750> all<00:01:15.900> this

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
really show much as far as how all this

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.810 
really show much as far as how all this
stuff<00:01:16.170> works<00:01:16.409> but<00:01:16.650> here<00:01:16.979> we<00:01:17.100> have<00:01:17.220> our<00:01:17.400> emerald

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
stuff works but here we have our emerald

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.109 
stuff works but here we have our emerald
armor<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.869> let's<00:01:18.990> go<00:01:19.080> ahead<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.290> put<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.680> on

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
armor so let's go ahead and put this on

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.020 
armor so let's go ahead and put this on
here<00:01:21.119> we<00:01:21.240> go<00:01:22.159> okay<00:01:23.159> so<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.549> looks<00:01:23.700> pretty<00:01:23.880> nice

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
here we go okay so it looks pretty nice

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.749 
here we go okay so it looks pretty nice
pretty<00:01:24.270> much<00:01:24.450> standard<00:01:25.170> textures<00:01:25.619> looks<00:01:26.549> good

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
pretty much standard textures looks good

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:32.649 
pretty much standard textures looks good
I<00:01:26.970> like<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:29.420> okay<00:01:30.420> let's<00:01:30.600> take<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.780> off

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
I like that okay let's take that off

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:36.050 
I like that okay let's take that off
okay<00:01:33.659> then<00:01:34.079> we<00:01:34.470> have<00:01:34.680> our<00:01:35.040> obsidian<00:01:35.579> tools<00:01:35.790> now

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
okay then we have our obsidian tools now

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.520 
okay then we have our obsidian tools now
these<00:01:36.210> are<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> little<00:01:36.509> bit<00:01:36.720> different<00:01:37.020> because

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
these are a little bit different because

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.090 
these are a little bit different because
they<00:01:37.890> add<00:01:38.070> some<00:01:38.759> new<00:01:38.820> items<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> game<00:01:39.509> so

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
they add some new items to the game so

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.590 
they add some new items to the game so
here<00:01:41.100> you<00:01:41.250> can<00:01:41.280> see<00:01:41.520> we<00:01:41.729> have<00:01:41.759> obscene<00:01:42.150> sticks

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
obsidian ingots so once that goes

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.410 
obsidian ingots so once that goes
through<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.399> can<00:01:56.549> see<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:56.850> will<00:01:57.030> get<00:01:57.180> one

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
through you can see we will get one

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.289 
through you can see we will get one
upsetting<00:01:57.990> it<00:01:58.670> there<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.820> go<00:01:59.880> there's<00:02:00.119> that

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
upsetting it there you go there's that

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.630 
upsetting it there you go there's that
then<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.170> make<00:02:01.259> an<00:02:01.409> obsidian<00:02:01.649> stick<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.369> put

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
then to make an obsidian stick you put

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.130 
then to make an obsidian stick you put
to<00:02:02.790> obsidian<00:02:03.060> ingots<00:02:03.540> on<00:02:03.630> top<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.930> each<00:02:03.990> other

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
to obsidian ingots on top of each other

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.080 
to obsidian ingots on top of each other
and<00:02:04.380> then<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.100> recipes<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.700> get<00:02:05.820> simple

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
and then the recipes just get simple

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.910 
and then the recipes just get simple
from<00:02:06.240> there<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.719> put<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.380> use<00:02:07.500> york<00:02:07.710> city

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
from there so you put you use york city

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.130 
from there so you put you use york city
and<00:02:08.069> sticks<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.550> then<00:02:08.670> your<00:02:09.330> city<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.690> ingots

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and sticks and then your city in ingots

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.809 
and sticks and then your city in ingots
and<00:02:10.259> I<00:02:10.500> believe<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.280> durability<00:02:11.550> on

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
and I believe it for the durability on

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.850 
and I believe it for the durability on
these<00:02:12.030> they<00:02:12.420> are<00:02:12.690> more<00:02:12.900> durable<00:02:13.080> than<00:02:13.350> diamond

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
these they are more durable than diamond

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.490 
these they are more durable than diamond
and<00:02:14.069> in<00:02:14.280> mine<00:02:14.459> at<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.730> same<00:02:14.910> speed<00:02:15.270> so<00:02:15.600> very

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
and in mine at the same speed so very

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.030 
and in mine at the same speed so very
good<00:02:16.709> for<00:02:16.920> those<00:02:17.630> okay<00:02:18.630> so<00:02:19.410> let's<00:02:19.890> go<00:02:20.010> ahead

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
good for those okay so let's go ahead

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.400 
good for those okay so let's go ahead

and try out the shovels or some some
dirt<00:02:24.170> yep<00:02:25.170> seems<00:02:25.500> pretty<00:02:25.680> fast<00:02:29.000> okay<00:02:30.000> moving

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
dirt yep seems pretty fast okay moving

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
crafted in the two by two grid which is

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.610 
crafted in the two by two grid which is
the<00:03:07.950> cool<00:03:08.100> part<00:03:08.130> about<00:03:08.340> them<00:03:08.700> right<00:03:09.480> and<00:03:09.810> they

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
the cool part about them right and they

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.090 
the cool part about them right and they
were<00:03:10.680> fairly<00:03:11.239> um<00:03:12.239> week<00:03:12.840> in<00:03:13.110> bye<00:03:13.650> week<00:03:13.830> I<00:03:13.950> mean

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
were fairly um week in bye week I mean

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.920 
were fairly um week in bye week I mean
they<00:03:14.340> don't<00:03:14.430> have<00:03:14.579> much<00:03:14.700> straw<00:03:14.880> bility<00:03:15.239> what

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
they don't have much straw bility what

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.420 
they don't have much straw bility what
they<00:03:16.019> do<00:03:16.079> mine<00:03:16.350> at<00:03:16.500> the<00:03:16.590> same<00:03:16.769> speeds<00:03:17.100> as<00:03:17.250> their

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
they do mine at the same speeds as their

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.610 
they do mine at the same speeds as their
larger<00:03:17.760> counterparts<00:03:17.910> so<00:03:18.450> that's<00:03:19.380> kind<00:03:19.560> of

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
larger counterparts so that's kind of

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.780 
larger counterparts so that's kind of
useful<00:03:19.769> if<00:03:20.010> you<00:03:20.100> just<00:03:20.310> don't<00:03:20.400> happen<00:03:20.579> to<00:03:20.730> have

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
useful if you just don't happen to have

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.460

a crafting table and you do have maybe

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.520 
a crafting table and you do have maybe
like<00:03:22.769> a<00:03:22.799> stick<00:03:23.220> in<00:03:23.579> a<00:03:23.970> combo<00:03:24.600> on<00:03:24.630> you<00:03:24.870> and<00:03:25.079> you

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
like a stick in a combo on you and you

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.690 
like a stick in a combo on you and you
just<00:03:25.560> need<00:03:25.860> something<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.310> defend<00:03:26.489> yourself

I've<00:03:27.180> been<00:03:27.360> in<00:03:27.510> that<00:03:27.600> situation<00:03:27.750> before<00:03:28.110> where

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
I've been in that situation before where

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.590 
I've been in that situation before where
that<00:03:28.620> would<00:03:28.680> have<00:03:28.799> been<00:03:28.860> useful<00:03:29.239> here<00:03:30.239> we<00:03:30.480> have

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
that would have been useful here we have

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.170 
that would have been useful here we have
clouds<00:03:30.930> which<00:03:31.650> generate<00:03:32.310> up<00:03:32.459> there<00:03:32.700> you<00:03:33.000> can

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
clouds which generate up there you can

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.970 
clouds which generate up there you can
see<00:03:33.209> them<00:03:33.480> now<00:03:33.510> they<00:03:34.200> generate<00:03:34.560> above<00:03:34.799> a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
see them now they generate above a

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.370 
see them now they generate above a
height<00:03:35.160> of<00:03:35.190> 180<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:36.959> can<00:03:37.079> see<00:03:37.200> there's

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
height of 180 so you can see there's

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.620 
height of 180 so you can see there's
quite<00:03:37.440> a<00:03:37.560> few<00:03:37.620> of<00:03:37.860> those<00:03:37.950> right<00:03:38.220> there<00:03:38.540> if<00:03:39.540> you

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
quite a few of those right there if you

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.000 
quite a few of those right there if you
jump<00:03:39.840> on<00:03:39.959> top<00:03:40.049> of<00:03:40.110> clouds<00:03:40.440> and<00:03:40.709> they<00:03:40.860> will

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
jump on top of clouds and they will

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.900 
jump on top of clouds and they will
actually<00:03:41.130> bounce<00:03:41.489> you<00:03:41.640> around<00:03:42.350> cool<00:03:43.910> so

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
actually bounce you around cool so

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.160 
actually bounce you around cool so
that's<00:03:45.060> pretty<00:03:45.239> nice<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:45.540> can<00:03:45.660> also<00:03:45.780> go

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
that's pretty nice you can also go

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.870 
that's pretty nice you can also go
straight<00:03:46.500> inside<00:03:46.620> and<00:03:47.459> they<00:03:47.519> will<00:03:47.640> send<00:03:47.790> you

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
straight inside and they will send you

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.150 
straight inside and they will send you
flying<00:03:48.120> neat<00:03:50.720> okay<00:03:51.720> so<00:03:52.170> when<00:03:52.860> you<00:03:52.950> break

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
flying neat okay so when you break

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.520 
flying neat okay so when you break
clouds<00:03:53.930> every<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.079> often<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:56.100> have<00:03:56.160> a<00:03:56.250> chance

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
clouds every so often you have a chance

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:00.470 
clouds every so often you have a chance
let's<00:03:58.530> see<00:03:58.709> I<00:03:58.920> just<00:03:59.760> didn't<00:04:00.000> get<00:04:00.060> lucky<00:04:00.360> with

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
let's see I just didn't get lucky with

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.400 
let's see I just didn't get lucky with
that<00:04:00.510> one<00:04:00.720> so<00:04:00.900> let's<00:04:01.049> get<00:04:01.140> some<00:04:01.230> more<00:04:01.320> clouds

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:03.410 
that one so let's get some more clouds

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:11.319 
that one so let's get some more clouds
okay<00:04:04.410> where<00:04:04.560> are<00:04:04.620> they

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:11.329 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.890

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:17.009 
just not getting lucky some of the place

00:04:17.009 --> 00:04:24.740 
just not getting lucky some of the place
a<00:04:17.040> bunch<00:04:17.280> of<00:04:17.370> all<00:04:20.209> hope<00:04:23.300> okay<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.509> there<00:04:24.600> you

a bunch of all hope okay and there you
go<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:24.840> can<00:04:25.050> see<00:04:25.169> we're<00:04:25.289> getting<00:04:25.350> some<00:04:25.590> of

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
go you can see we're getting some of

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.480 
go you can see we're getting some of
those<00:04:25.740> hearts<00:04:26.070> and<00:04:26.340> what<00:04:26.610> those<00:04:26.759> are<00:04:28.280> ok<00:04:29.280> these

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
those hearts and what those are ok these

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:32.510 
those hearts and what those are ok these
are<00:04:29.630> atmospheric<00:04:30.630> aerosols<00:04:31.050> and<00:04:31.400> these<00:04:32.400> are

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
are atmospheric aerosols and these are

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.010 
are atmospheric aerosols and these are
kind<00:04:32.669> of<00:04:32.729> neat<00:04:32.880> because<00:04:33.150> they<00:04:33.300> can<00:04:33.600> instantly

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
kind of neat because they can instantly

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.480 
kind of neat because they can instantly
heal<00:04:34.320> you<00:04:34.470> just<00:04:35.340> a<00:04:35.490> nice<00:04:35.639> feature<00:04:35.880> of<00:04:36.060> them<00:04:37.490> all

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
heal you just a nice feature of them all

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.240 
heal you just a nice feature of them all
right<00:04:38.759> then<00:04:39.350> you<00:04:40.350> can<00:04:40.470> also<00:04:40.590> make<00:04:40.919> these<00:04:41.070> into

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
right then you can also make these into

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.250 
right then you can also make these into
some<00:04:41.460> different<00:04:41.729> stuff<00:04:41.880> so<00:04:42.150> here<00:04:42.389> you<00:04:42.840> can<00:04:43.050> see

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
some different stuff so here you can see

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.360 
some different stuff so here you can see
if<00:04:43.320> we<00:04:43.410> take<00:04:43.500> you<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.680> an<00:04:43.800> atmospheric

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
if we take you to an atmospheric

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.850 
if we take you to an atmospheric
aerosols<00:04:44.850> we<00:04:45.150> get<00:04:45.270> a<00:04:45.300> holy<00:04:45.539> stick<00:04:45.930> and<00:04:46.139> then

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
aerosols we get a holy stick and then

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.860 
aerosols we get a holy stick and then
with<00:04:47.190> two<00:04:47.580> holy<00:04:47.760> sticks<00:04:48.150> in<00:04:48.360> an<00:04:48.479> atmospheric

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
with two holy sticks in an atmospheric

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.140 
with two holy sticks in an atmospheric
aerosol<00:04:49.380> you<00:04:50.220> know<00:04:50.310> we<00:04:50.580> can<00:04:50.729> make<00:04:50.850> a<00:04:50.880> holy

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
aerosol you know we can make a holy

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.090 
aerosol you know we can make a holy
staff<00:04:51.479> and<00:04:51.990> what<00:04:52.289> this<00:04:52.380> allows<00:04:52.440> you<00:04:52.740> to<00:04:52.830> do<00:04:52.919> is

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
staff and what this allows you to do is

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.640 
staff and what this allows you to do is
if<00:04:53.370> you<00:04:53.460> have<00:04:53.490> it<00:04:53.669> in<00:04:54.300> your<00:04:54.389> hand<00:04:54.600> then<00:04:55.350> you<00:04:55.500> can

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
if you have it in your hand then you can

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.129 
if you have it in your hand then you can
right-click<00:04:56.010> for<00:04:56.220> a<00:04:56.430> high<00:04:56.580> jump<00:04:56.850> and<00:04:57.020> then<00:04:58.020> it

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
right-click for a high jump and then it

00:04:58.139 --> 00:04:59.570 
right-click for a high jump and then it
will<00:04:58.229> also<00:04:58.380> negate<00:04:58.770> fall<00:04:58.979> damage<00:04:59.280> the<00:04:59.400> only

00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 
will also negate fall damage the only

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.210 
will also negate fall damage the only
thing<00:04:59.729> is<00:04:59.910> you<00:05:00.710> can<00:05:01.710> see<00:05:04.010> doesn't<00:05:05.010> have<00:05:05.099> much

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
thing is you can see doesn't have much

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.460 
thing is you can see doesn't have much
durability<00:05:05.550> at<00:05:05.820> all<00:05:05.910> so<00:05:06.260> there's<00:05:07.260> sort<00:05:07.380> of

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
durability at all so there's sort of

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.790 
durability at all so there's sort of
anything<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:07.919> can<00:05:08.070> use<00:05:09.139> OOP<00:05:10.139> that<00:05:10.410> may<00:05:10.590> kill

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
anything you can use OOP that may kill

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:22.810 
anything you can use OOP that may kill
me<00:05:12.680> OOP<00:05:13.680> that<00:05:14.280> was<00:05:14.370> a<00:05:14.400> fail<00:05:14.610> okay

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.120

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
ok I'm back so we'll just finish this

guy off and you can see if we tap right

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:29.330 
guy off and you can see if we tap right
above<00:05:28.350> the<00:05:28.500> ground<00:05:28.680> then<00:05:28.949> we<00:05:29.039> won't<00:05:29.190> take<00:05:29.280> any

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
above the ground then we won't take any

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.340 
above the ground then we won't take any
damage<00:05:29.639> oh<00:05:32.030> there<00:05:33.030> yep<00:05:33.300> ok<00:05:33.690> so<00:05:33.990> that's<00:05:34.169> done

you can see if I break fossils and I
just<00:06:33.960> get<00:06:34.139> some<00:06:34.320> bones<00:06:34.940> so<00:06:35.940> that's<00:06:36.120> pretty

00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 
in there are our rubies that is the new

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:49.040 
in there are our rubies that is the new
or<00:06:45.810> that<00:06:46.139> the<00:06:46.260> sads<00:06:47.539> so<00:06:48.539> you<00:06:48.599> can<00:06:48.720> see<00:06:48.840> that's

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.629 
or that the sads so you can see that's
just<00:06:49.110> like<00:06:49.349> any<00:06:49.470> other<00:06:49.560> or<00:06:49.860> I<00:06:50.099> got<00:06:50.460> my<00:06:50.580> two

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 
just like any other or I got my two

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:53.870 
just like any other or I got my two
rubies<00:06:51.120> and<00:06:51.650> then<00:06:52.650> here<00:06:53.159> we<00:06:53.190> have<00:06:53.430> our<00:06:53.460> Ruby

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:53.880 
rubies and then here we have our Ruby

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.520 
rubies and then here we have our Ruby
tools<00:06:54.120> which<00:06:54.330> are<00:06:54.449> crafted<00:06:54.810> just<00:06:55.169> like<00:06:55.320> any

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
tools which are crafted just like any

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:58.580 
tools which are crafted just like any
other<00:06:55.590> tool<00:06:55.949> with<00:06:56.400> six<00:06:57.050> ok<00:06:58.050> pretty<00:06:58.320> simple

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
other tool with six ok pretty simple

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.110 
other tool with six ok pretty simple
stuff<00:06:58.680> let's<00:06:59.009> go<00:06:59.099> ahead<00:06:59.159> and<00:06:59.280> test<00:06:59.520> these<00:06:59.699> out

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:02.120 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.159 

ok<00:07:03.120> so<00:07:03.180> it<00:07:03.330> appears<00:07:03.570> to<00:07:03.690> be<00:07:03.780> a<00:07:03.810> little<00:07:04.020> bit

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:04.169 
ok so it appears to be a little bit

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:05.510 
ok so it appears to be a little bit
slower<00:07:04.440> than<00:07:04.620> diamond<00:07:05.009> and<00:07:05.190> I<00:07:05.220> would<00:07:05.340> guess

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 
slower than diamond and I would guess

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.089 
slower than diamond and I would guess
that<00:07:05.550> the<00:07:05.820> durability<00:07:06.180> is<00:07:06.509> also<00:07:06.810> less<00:07:07.099> just

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:08.099 
that the durability is also less just

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:09.860 
that the durability is also less just
something<00:07:08.340> eat<00:07:08.430> that<00:07:08.580> it<00:07:09.120> adds<00:07:09.330> and<00:07:09.599> then<00:07:09.780> we

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:09.870 
something eat that it adds and then we

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:11.240 
something eat that it adds and then we
have<00:07:09.990> our<00:07:10.169> Ruby<00:07:10.440> armor<00:07:10.710> let's<00:07:10.949> look<00:07:11.039> at<00:07:11.190> the

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:11.250 
have our Ruby armor let's look at the

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:15.350 
have our Ruby armor let's look at the
textures<00:07:13.280> ok<00:07:14.280> very<00:07:14.639> cool<00:07:14.699> sorry<00:07:15.120> about<00:07:15.270> the

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:15.360 
textures ok very cool sorry about the

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.390 
textures ok very cool sorry about the
rain<00:07:15.539> it<00:07:15.900> won't<00:07:16.139> stop<00:07:16.289> for<00:07:16.650> whatever<00:07:17.099> reason

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 
rain it won't stop for whatever reason

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:20.210 
rain it won't stop for whatever reason
ok<00:07:18.270> and<00:07:18.419> that<00:07:18.539> looks<00:07:18.750> it<00:07:19.590> looks<00:07:19.710> really<00:07:19.949> cool

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:20.220 
ok and that looks it looks really cool

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:22.909 
ok and that looks it looks really cool
as<00:07:20.310> well<00:07:20.340> I<00:07:20.520> think<00:07:20.930> maybe<00:07:21.930> the<00:07:22.409> mud<00:07:22.590> creator

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:22.919 
as well I think maybe the mud creator

00:07:22.919 --> 00:07:25.010 
as well I think maybe the mud creator
should<00:07:23.159> take<00:07:23.280> a<00:07:23.310> little<00:07:23.460> bit<00:07:23.639> out<00:07:23.789> of<00:07:23.820> the<00:07:24.060> the

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 
should take a little bit out of the the

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.230 
should take a little bit out of the the
cherry<00:07:25.440> look<00:07:25.800> of<00:07:25.949> it<00:07:26.099> that's<00:07:26.820> just<00:07:26.880> a<00:07:27.030> little

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:27.240 
cherry look of it that's just a little

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.520 
cherry look of it that's just a little
bit<00:07:27.330> too<00:07:27.419> bright<00:07:27.630> for<00:07:27.659> me<00:07:27.840> but<00:07:28.229> in<00:07:28.289> my<00:07:28.409> opinion

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.530 
bit too bright for me but in my opinion

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:30.050 
bit too bright for me but in my opinion
I<00:07:28.860> like<00:07:28.889> all<00:07:29.159> the<00:07:29.340> other<00:07:29.460> textures<00:07:29.849> so

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 
I like all the other textures so

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.719 
I like all the other textures so
shouldn't<00:07:31.050> really<00:07:31.080> be<00:07:31.229> complaining<00:07:31.729> anyway

00:07:32.719 --> 00:07:32.729 
shouldn't really be complaining anyway

00:07:32.729 --> 00:07:34.750 
shouldn't really be complaining anyway
