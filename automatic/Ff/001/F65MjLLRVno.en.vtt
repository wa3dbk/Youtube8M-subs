00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello to all of us we find ourselves a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.849
 again for a new video 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.730
 on the missions the black guard is 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.049
 so today we will be interested in 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:20.130
 a base that is on my archipelago since 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:23.490
 a while and who is called having 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.310
 which is ok or that opener that is 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.720
 a base level 39 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.850
 I show it to you and I explain 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.700
 why I decided to attack in r &amp; d m 

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:38.250
 well simply because there 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:40.290
 we have a ton of super cannon and 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.219
 cannons to be more precise four 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:46.170
 super cannon and three cannons and me so 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.840
 you saw my other videos 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.050
 know that I attack most of the time 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:55.230
 as alas and typically a 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.809
 low that it absolutely must not be done 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.960
 as because it's fatal it's 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.180
 really too much damage for 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.600
 the tanks and so the rcd medicine-ball 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.750
 a good alternative for this kind of 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.909
 base so erdem I remind him it's 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.140
 shot in one case and doctors have 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:21.259
 beach and July 3 x 16 twice 8 mocha 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:26.509
 and three doctors so now 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:26.509
 how am I going to attack this base 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:30.570
 e 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:46.070
 i think i'm going yeah i'm going 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.070
 try to go to the left 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:58.649
 I will go through the left one 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:02:04.259
 destroying beforehand what am I 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:06.530
 will destroy the two super cannon of 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.530
 middle 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:20.980
 here I am so I hesitate I landed everything 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.960
 here I am 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.920
 I am super mine but it was sure 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.320
 yes I will use everywhere but because 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.560
 that he's sorry for me along the river 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:46.400
 to them now I'm heading to 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:49.040
 level small ouch ouch ouch it 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:54.940
 kill me mortar a lot of damage to 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.940
 rcnm game the freeze 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:12.870
 here you go, come and get stuck here 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.340
 will avoid the damage spoken by the 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.950
 cannons and by machine gun 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.070
 this is only the super end that we 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.440
 shoot on it but it's not a big deal 

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:30.720
 tac and that's it for this level base 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:32.910
 39 can opener game in french yeah that 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.030
 is it okay then at the level of 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.880
 rewards sat there is not bad 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.670
 greeting speaks stone 50000 stone 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:47.370
 so that's pretty much a medal 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:51.120
 no gems or modules of 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:53.940
 prototype and at the level of losses 21 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:56.040
 shot and 4 zucca so that's not it 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:59.480
 huge for what it costs frankly 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:03.000
 Better to lose it than some time 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:04.980
 that's costing me 19 miles to redo and 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.010
 at the time level this is in nine 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:11.280
 minutes I would have everything while my if 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:15.360
 I had attacked as I am 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.950
 certainly lost I do not know how much 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.620
 but I may not have finished with them 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:22.440
 as long as it is suddenly to remake its ends to 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:24.990
 rebuild his yard a lot of 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.910
 gold coins and a lot a lot of 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.650
 time so that's it for this base of 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.600
 level 39 that was open me you 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:35.700
 do not hesitate to like and commented 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.110
 especially to say if you too you 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.690
 have attacked in r 2 m or 1 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.850
 something else and if by the way you have 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:44.610
 been attacked as that would be 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.770
 interesting to know 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.630
 and so that's me I wish you a 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:51.340
 good game I tell you next time for 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:55.320
 a new video about the missions of 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.320
