in<00:00:17.190> quite<00:00:17.550> some<00:00:17.789> time<00:00:18.000> so<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.960> know<00:00:18.990> Apple<00:00:19.410> did

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
dock and before lightning even existed

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.759 
dock and before lightning even existed
there<00:00:30.269> used<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.539> universal<00:00:31.170> dock<00:00:31.320> apple

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769

sold for pingos almost 80 bucks so these

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.139 
sold for pingos almost 80 bucks so these
are<00:00:34.739> really<00:00:34.890> overpriced<00:00:35.430> but<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.880> know<00:00:36.000> it's

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149

no cable included here guys just a dock
as<00:01:23.729> you<00:01:23.909> can<00:01:24.060> see<00:01:24.380> unlike<00:01:25.380> previous<00:01:25.740> docks

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
as you can see unlike previous docks

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.630 
as you can see unlike previous docks
this<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:27.869> completely<00:01:28.259> flat<00:01:28.590> so<00:01:29.369> there's<00:01:29.520> no

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
this is completely flat so there's no

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.929 
this is completely flat so there's no
ridges<00:01:30.030> here<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.360> prevent<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.750> from<00:01:30.810> holding

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
ridges here to prevent it from holding

ridges here to prevent it from holding
any<00:01:32.939> type<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.150> device<00:01:33.420> which<00:01:33.630> means<00:01:33.869> this<00:01:34.049> will

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
any type of device which means this will

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.219 
any type of device which means this will
actually<00:01:34.350> work<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.710> cases<00:01:35.310> as<00:01:35.430> well<00:01:35.460> so

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
actually work with cases as well so

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.170 
actually work with cases as well so
