00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.670
 learn to make potatoes with chorizo ​​ok 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.780
 what do we need? 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:16.480
 need obvious potatoes 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:19.189
 garlic onion may be something normal or the 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.090
 I wave that I teach them to prepare that 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.430
 is seasoned and delicious chorizo ​​remains 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.320
 I in this case I will occupy green and if 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.349
 you want it to bite you can put the 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.020
 chilito serrano or without chile joined 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.340
 perfect preference to start the 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.520
 potatoes 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:42.180
 This is without peeling the p keep the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.280
 shells I'll leave another video these 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.080
 we can make them as chips and they remain 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.150
 delicious snacks a very rich botanita 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.309
 healthy and finally do not waste 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.840
 nothing now that if you do not want to peel them 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.239
 as you want, I have made potatoes with 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.120
 equal chorizo without peeling the potato 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.440
 obviously nothing but well washed and 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.290
 ready 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.009
 to put them to cook the grids 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.399
 very small so that they are sewed a lot 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:15.720
 faster the onion in the same way already 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:19.619
 finally it would sink and we would occupy a 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:23.090
 agito or half a tablespoon of garlic 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.570
 prepared here I'm going to leave you 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:30.770
 garlic link and here also the 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:32.659
 chips of the potato shells since 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.090
 we have everything chopped finally and 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.159
 perfect let's put to bake our 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:42.670
 potatoes so they remain 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:45.490
 let's say as they say in the pasta that 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.560
 they remain al dente not firm inside and 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.030
 soft on the outside so they are already 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.469
 well cooked but that is also not 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:56.500
 break up as if it were for puree the 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:02:00.310
 onion we are going to thunder it and we are going to 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.429
 fry garlic and chorizo ​​there 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.250
 then let me start cooking 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:10.340
 potatoes and right now I see them so 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:13.220
 let's finish preparing this is 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.430
 perfect friends almost perfectly 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.739
 well the chips were ready and 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.340
 this way thundering the onion with the garlic 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:26.150
 and the chori quoted him remove the membrane that 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:28.340
 It brings ok uses already I left the chorizo ​​ready 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.260
 You can do this if you do not eat 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.840
 Pork meat is also chorizo from 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.540
 turkey chicken and it's also very very 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:38.180
 tasty ok good now what I'm going to 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.790
 to do is I'm going to thunder the average 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.110
 onion and when it starts barely 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.030
 transparent we are going to take the 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.730
 chorizo ​​to start saving now 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.799
 that is golden the solicitous then 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.319
 is when I proceed to put the potato 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:57.140

00:02:54.319 --> 00:03:00.319

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:03.860
