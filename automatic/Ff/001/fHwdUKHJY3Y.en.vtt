music but for heavy users you might want

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.810 
music but for heavy users you might want
to<00:05:01.230> think<00:05:01.380> about<00:05:01.440> charging<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:02.130> light<00:05:02.340> nightly

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
to think about charging it light nightly

to think about charging it light nightly
so<00:05:03.600> here's<00:05:03.750> the<00:05:03.810> thing<00:05:03.930> about<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.260> torch<00:05:04.560> 9810

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:05.190 
so here's the thing about the torch 9810

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.730 
so here's the thing about the torch 9810
it<00:05:05.610> just<00:05:05.790> simply<00:05:06.120> lacks<00:05:06.660> that<00:05:06.810> wow<00:05:07.140> fact<00:05:07.500> it's

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
it just simply lacks that wow fact it's

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.950 
it just simply lacks that wow fact it's
real<00:05:07.980> and<00:05:08.130> customers<00:05:08.880> mainly<00:05:09.450> because<00:05:09.810> it

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
real and customers mainly because it

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.290 
real and customers mainly because it
recycles<00:05:10.260> in<00:05:10.620> sign<00:05:10.860> of<00:05:10.890> its<00:05:11.250> predecessor<00:05:12.150> and

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 
in terms of specs even though it is

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:16.760 
in terms of specs even though it is
upgrading<00:05:14.730> from<00:05:14.880> its<00:05:15.150> predecessor<00:05:16.140> it

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
upgrading from its predecessor it

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:18.470 
upgrading from its predecessor it
