a<00:01:39.259> lot<00:01:39.530> of<00:01:39.560> these<00:01:39.710> spawns<00:01:40.450> and<00:01:41.450> once<00:01:41.659> I<00:01:41.780> start

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
a lot of these spawns and once I start

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.230 
a lot of these spawns and once I start
getting<00:01:42.170> accustomed<00:01:42.740> to<00:01:42.890> how<00:01:43.070> enemies<00:01:43.969> run

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:45.560 
through the math and the routes that I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.560 
through the math and the routes that I
can<00:01:45.799> take<00:01:45.979> to<00:01:46.130> counteract<00:01:46.640> them<00:01:46.850> I<00:01:47.030> feel<00:01:47.479> like

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.830 
wears off like right there and I do
eventually<00:04:48.400> die<00:04:48.790> on<00:04:49.120> that<00:04:49.150> streak<00:04:49.630> right

eventually die on that streak right

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.140 
eventually die on that streak right
after<00:04:50.020> got<00:04:50.170> the<00:04:50.260> swarm<00:04:50.500> I<00:04:50.620> died<00:04:50.860> and<00:04:51.760> that's

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
after got the swarm I died and that's

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.550 
after got the swarm I died and that's
just<00:04:52.300> because<00:04:52.510> I<00:04:52.630> was<00:04:52.780> in<00:04:52.900> the<00:04:52.990> spawn<00:04:53.230> I<00:04:53.260> didn't

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
just because I was in the spawn I didn't

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.650 
just because I was in the spawn I didn't
have<00:04:53.680> a<00:04:53.710> VSAT<00:04:54.160> up<00:04:54.370> and<00:04:54.610> for<00:04:54.970> some<00:04:55.000> reason<00:04:55.480> when

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
have a VSAT up and for some reason when

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.990 
have a VSAT up and for some reason when
you<00:04:55.690> do<00:04:55.960> have<00:04:56.200> a<00:04:56.230> VSAT<00:04:56.740> up<00:04:56.950> the<00:04:57.070> enemies<00:04:57.490> they

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
you do have a VSAT up the enemies they

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.990 
you do have a VSAT up the enemies they
tend<00:04:58.270> to<00:04:58.330> be<00:04:58.510> there<00:04:59.200> their<00:04:59.620> alertness<00:05:00.000> level

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
tend to be there their alertness level

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.330 
tend to be there their alertness level
goes<00:05:01.360> through<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.900> roof<00:05:02.050> you'd<00:05:02.380> be<00:05:02.620> surprised

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
goes through the roof you'd be surprised

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.040 
goes through the roof you'd be surprised
they're<00:05:03.760> constantly<00:05:04.270> checking<00:05:04.540> corners<00:05:05.020> I

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.050 
they're constantly checking corners I

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.510 
they're constantly checking corners I
mean<00:05:05.290> if<00:05:05.380> they<00:05:05.560> got<00:05:05.740> dogs<00:05:05.980> out<00:05:06.310> they're

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:06.520 
mean if they got dogs out they're

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.920 
mean if they got dogs out they're
probably<00:05:06.610> sitting<00:05:06.970> in<00:05:07.120> corners<00:05:07.480> themselves

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
probably sitting in corners themselves

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.740 
probably sitting in corners themselves

is when say I didn't have a VSAT there I

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:06.840 
is when say I didn't have a VSAT there I
would<00:06:05.800> have<00:06:05.890> done<00:06:06.070> the<00:06:06.190> exact<00:06:06.550> same<00:06:06.580> thing

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:06.850 
would have done the exact same thing

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:09.360 
would have done the exact same thing
because<00:06:07.420> the<00:06:08.200> way<00:06:08.320> that<00:06:08.500> the<00:06:08.650> spawns<00:06:08.920> work<00:06:09.220> in

would<00:06:15.970> work<00:06:16.120> is<00:06:16.300> they<00:06:16.450> would<00:06:16.600> have<00:06:16.630> off<00:06:17.080> spawns

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:17.470 
would work is they would have off spawns

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:18.960 
would work is they would have off spawns
on<00:06:17.710> the<00:06:17.830> sides<00:06:18.100> of<00:06:18.280> the<00:06:18.370> map<00:06:18.520> saying<00:06:18.880> the

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
on the sides of the map saying the

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.270 
on the sides of the map saying the
enemies<00:06:19.300> had<00:06:19.510> to<00:06:19.690> be<00:06:19.840> flat<00:06:20.140> then<00:06:20.950> they<00:06:21.100> would

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
enemies had to be flat then they would

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.100 
enemies had to be flat then they would
be<00:06:21.430> spawning<00:06:21.730> off<00:06:22.120> to<00:06:22.360> the<00:06:22.450> side<00:06:22.660> of<00:06:22.840> the<00:06:22.960> be

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:23.110 
be spawning off to the side of the be

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:25.380 
be spawning off to the side of the be
flag<00:06:23.380> and<00:06:23.740> they<00:06:23.800> would<00:06:23.950> not<00:06:24.100> spawn<00:06:24.430> usually<00:06:25.180> in

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:25.390 
flag and they would not spawn usually in

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:29.160 
flag and they would not spawn usually in
the<00:06:25.870> backs<00:06:26.110> of<00:06:26.320> the<00:06:26.440> other<00:06:26.620> flags<00:06:27.510> so<00:06:28.510> there's

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:29.170 
the backs of the other flags so there's

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.740 
the backs of the other flags so there's
no<00:06:29.380> there's<00:06:29.620> no<00:06:29.860> real<00:06:30.190> off<00:06:30.430> spawns<00:06:30.820> here<00:06:31.000> so<00:06:31.450> I

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:31.750 
no there's no real off spawns here so I

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.650 
no there's no real off spawns here so I
mean<00:06:32.380> they'll<00:06:33.220> spawn<00:06:33.520> in<00:06:33.730> the<00:06:33.820> back<00:06:34.060> of<00:06:34.240> a<00:06:34.390> or

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:34.660 
mean they'll spawn in the back of a or

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:36.480 
mean they'll spawn in the back of a or
the<00:06:34.810> back<00:06:35.080> of<00:06:35.290> C<00:06:35.470> and<00:06:35.740> they<00:06:35.950> all<00:06:36.160> spawn

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:36.490 
the back of C and they all spawn

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:38.490 
the back of C and they all spawn
together<00:06:36.880> you<00:06:37.120> can<00:06:37.300> actually<00:06:37.630> be<00:06:37.720> standing<00:06:38.350> in

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
together you can actually be standing in

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.200 
together you can actually be standing in
the<00:06:38.620> back<00:06:38.650> of<00:06:38.980> their<00:06:39.100> spawn<00:06:39.340> and<00:06:39.670> if<00:06:39.760> you<00:06:39.910> turn

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
the back of their spawn and if you turn

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.880 
the back of their spawn and if you turn
your<00:06:40.390> character<00:06:40.630> around<00:06:40.870> so<00:06:41.350> your<00:06:41.560> back<00:06:41.860> is

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:41.890 
your character around so your back is

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:44.520 
your character around so your back is
facing<00:06:42.520> the<00:06:42.610> spawn<00:06:42.880> they<00:06:43.690> spawn<00:06:43.990> on<00:06:44.170> top<00:06:44.380> of

facing the spawn they spawn on top of

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.200 
facing the spawn they spawn on top of
you<00:06:44.620> and<00:06:44.830> there's<00:06:45.190> been<00:06:45.310> a<00:06:45.340> lot<00:06:45.520> of<00:06:45.550> situations

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:13.950 
spawn system works the maps are really

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:18.080 
spawn system works the maps are really
small<00:07:14.450> and<00:07:16.340> yeah<00:07:17.340> guys<00:07:17.520> that's<00:07:17.700> pretty<00:07:17.940> much
