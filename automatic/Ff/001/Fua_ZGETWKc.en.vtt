00:00:38.889 --> 00:00:38.899 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:01:12.340 

thinking<00:00:39.899> about<00:00:40.140> us

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.840 

with<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> addition<00:01:13.890> of<00:01:13.980> the<00:01:14.130> fly<00:01:14.340> wire<00:01:14.580> and

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
with the addition of the fly wire and

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.130 
with the addition of the fly wire and
extra<00:01:15.120> padding<00:01:15.480> the<00:01:15.720> upper<00:01:15.930> on<00:01:16.050> the

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
extra padding the upper on the

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.050 
extra padding the upper on the
hypervenom<00:01:16.500> 2<00:01:16.740> is<00:01:17.010> completely<00:01:17.640> different

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
hypervenom 2 is completely different

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.480 
hypervenom 2 is completely different
than<00:01:18.180> its<00:01:18.300> previous<00:01:18.510> model<00:01:19.170> due<00:01:20.010> to<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.280> fly

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
than its previous model due to the fly

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.000 
than its previous model due to the fly
wire<00:01:20.730> the<00:01:21.720> fit<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> lot<00:01:22.470> tighter<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 
wire the fit is a lot tighter and

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.010 
wire the fit is a lot tighter and
therefore<00:01:23.550> your<00:01:23.700> foot<00:01:23.940> is<00:01:24.120> a<00:01:24.150> lot<00:01:24.480> more<00:01:24.720> locked

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
therefore your foot is a lot more locked

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.010 
therefore your foot is a lot more locked
in<00:01:25.880> compared<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:26.940> the<00:01:27.090> hypervenom<00:01:27.480> one<00:01:27.810> I

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
in compared to the hypervenom one I

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.020 
in compared to the hypervenom one I
didn't<00:01:28.500> really<00:01:28.710> feel<00:01:28.980> my<00:01:29.280> foot<00:01:29.490> slipping

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
didn't really feel my foot slipping

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.540 
didn't really feel my foot slipping
around<00:01:30.210> in<00:01:30.510> the<00:01:30.630> boots<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.500> addition<00:01:32.130> the

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
around in the boots in addition the

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.340 
around in the boots in addition the
upper<00:01:32.760> on<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:32.970> hypervenom<00:01:33.330> 2<00:01:33.510> is<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.080> bit

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
upper on the hypervenom 2 is a bit

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.990 
upper on the hypervenom 2 is a bit
thicker<00:01:34.620> than<00:01:34.860> its<00:01:35.130> previous<00:01:35.520> model<00:01:35.610> and

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
thicker than its previous model and

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.120 
thicker than its previous model and
therefore<00:01:36.240> provides<00:01:36.750> more<00:01:36.990> protection<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
therefore provides more protection the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.890 
therefore provides more protection the
only<00:01:38.340> downside<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:39.060> that<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.480> doesn't<00:01:39.660> give

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
only downside is that it doesn't give

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.660 
only downside is that it doesn't give
you<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.020> barefoot<00:01:40.560> feel<00:01:40.860> that<00:01:41.550> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
you the barefoot feel that the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.530 
you the barefoot feel that the
hypervenom<00:01:42.060> want<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.480> would<00:01:42.570> give<00:01:42.780> you<00:01:44.540> new

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
hypervenom want it would give you new

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.390 
hypervenom want it would give you new
addition<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.170> hypervenom<00:01:46.560> 2<00:01:46.740> is<00:01:47.340> a

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
addition for the hypervenom 2 is a

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.510 
addition for the hypervenom 2 is a
dynamic<00:01:48.090> color<00:01:48.330> however<00:01:48.870> from<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:49.920> Superfly

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
dynamic color however from the Superfly

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.030 
dynamic color however from the Superfly
Ximena<00:01:50.880> Jesus<00:01:51.300> that<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:52.200> move<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.380> seam<00:01:52.710> from

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
Ximena Jesus that you move the seam from

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.590 
Ximena Jesus that you move the seam from
the<00:01:53.190> back<00:01:53.400> along<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.210> sides

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
the back along the sides

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.210 
the back along the sides
this<00:01:54.900> prevents<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.440> lot<00:01:55.470> of<00:01:55.650> the<00:01:55.710> issue<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.980> we

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
this prevents a lot of the issue that we

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.740 
this prevents a lot of the issue that we
had<00:01:56.370> with<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.610> other<00:01:56.670> two<00:01:56.970> boots<00:01:57.240> with<00:01:57.660> the

had with the other two boots with the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.840 
had with the other two boots with the
blisters<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.530> pressure<00:01:58.800> mur<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
blisters and the pressure mur the

soleplate<00:02:00.090> on<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.510> hypervenom<00:02:00.900> 2<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.380> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
soleplate on the hypervenom 2 is the

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.560 
soleplate on the hypervenom 2 is the
exact<00:02:01.920> same<00:02:02.130> as<00:02:02.190> the<00:02:02.400> hypervenom<00:02:02.760> one<00:02:03.060> the

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
exact same as the hypervenom one the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.090 
exact same as the hypervenom one the
only<00:02:03.750> difference<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.380> that<00:02:04.410> the<00:02:04.680> hydrophone

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
only difference is that the hydrophone

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.460 
only difference is that the hydrophone
of<00:02:05.220> 2<00:02:05.430> has<00:02:05.940> a<00:02:05.970> way<00:02:06.180> more<00:02:06.360> flexible<00:02:06.930> sole<00:02:07.200> plate

of 2 has a way more flexible sole plate

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.560 
of 2 has a way more flexible sole plate
