just kick and snare so so that's why I'm

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:10.590 
just kick and snare so so that's why I'm
gonna<00:02:01.600> go<00:02:01.690> with<00:02:01.810> I<00:02:01.900> think<00:02:01.930> I<00:02:09.479> don't<00:02:10.479> actually

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
gonna go with I think I don't actually

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.730 
gonna go with I think I don't actually
move<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:12.870> now<00:02:13.870> I'll<00:02:13.990> keep<00:02:14.200> it<00:02:14.320> there<00:02:14.470> I'll

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:14.740 
move that now I'll keep it there I'll

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.850 
move that now I'll keep it there I'll
keep<00:02:14.950> that<00:02:15.070> snow<00:02:15.310> there<00:02:16.410> so<00:02:17.410> as<00:02:17.620> you<00:02:17.710> can<00:02:17.800> see

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
keep that snow there so as you can see

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.720 
keep that snow there so as you can see
it<00:02:18.490> sounds<00:02:18.850> okay<00:02:19.120> but<00:02:19.440> it's<00:02:20.440> missing<00:02:20.680> a<00:02:20.860> lot<00:02:21.070> so

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
it sounds okay but it's missing a lot so

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.670 
it sounds okay but it's missing a lot so
I<00:02:21.760> think<00:02:21.940> to<00:02:22.630> fill<00:02:22.870> out<00:02:22.990> all<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.260> spaces<00:02:23.500> I'm

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
I think to fill out all the spaces I'm

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.440 
I think to fill out all the spaces I'm
going<00:02:23.800> to<00:02:23.860> add<00:02:23.920> just<00:02:25.350> hi-hat<00:02:26.350> on<00:02:26.470> each<00:02:26.590> -<00:02:26.890> so

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
going to add just hi-hat on each - so

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.840 
going to add just hi-hat on each - so
solicit<00:02:28.450> about<00:02:28.740> it<00:02:29.740> will<00:02:29.860> be<00:02:29.920> fat<00:02:30.100> for<00:02:30.520> this<00:02:30.670> -

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
solicit about it will be fat for this -

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.820 
solicit about it will be fat for this -
it<00:02:31.000> take<00:02:31.990> off<00:02:32.170> the<00:02:32.290> velocity<00:02:34.530> you'll<00:02:35.530> see<00:02:35.710> why

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
it take off the velocity you'll see why

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:48.150 
it take off the velocity you'll see why
I've<00:02:35.980> done<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.250> in<00:02:36.340> a<00:02:36.370> minute<00:02:46.530> yeah<00:02:47.530> just<00:02:48.010> a

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
I've done that in a minute yeah just a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.580 
I've done that in a minute yeah just a
really<00:02:48.520> simple<00:02:48.990> we'll<00:02:49.990> get<00:02:50.140> back<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.440> the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
really simple we'll get back to the

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.940 
really simple we'll get back to the
velocity<00:02:51.280> in<00:02:51.340> a<00:02:51.490> second<00:02:51.940> but<00:02:52.560> first<00:02:53.560> I'm<00:02:53.770> just

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
velocity in a second but first I'm just

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.770 
velocity in a second but first I'm just
going<00:02:54.130> to<00:02:54.190> try<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.400> finish<00:02:54.670> it<00:02:54.910> off<00:02:55.000> I'm<00:02:55.300> going

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
going to try and finish it off I'm going

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.740 
going to try and finish it off I'm going
to<00:02:55.870> put<00:02:56.020> an<00:02:56.140> open<00:02:56.350> hi-hat<00:02:56.709> at<00:02:57.070> the<00:02:57.160> end<00:02:57.280> online

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
to put an open hi-hat at the end online

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.570 
to put an open hi-hat at the end online
just<00:02:58.750> because<00:02:58.840> I<00:02:59.020> think<00:02:59.080> it's<00:02:59.620> really<00:02:59.800> nice<00:03:00.040> to

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
just because I think it's really nice to

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.750 
just because I think it's really nice to
end<00:03:00.910> a<00:03:01.540> pattern<00:03:01.870> on<00:03:01.989> that<00:03:02.020> so<00:03:02.890> you'll<00:03:03.550> see<00:03:03.730> I

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
end a pattern on that so you'll see I

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.010 
end a pattern on that so you'll see I
mean<00:03:09.000> do<00:03:10.000> you<00:03:10.060> know<00:03:10.180> I<00:03:10.209> mean<00:03:10.420> it's<00:03:10.660> just<00:03:10.720> I

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.020 
mean do you know I mean it's just I

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.979 
mean do you know I mean it's just I
don't<00:03:11.170> know<00:03:11.620> I<00:03:11.680> think<00:03:11.950> it's<00:03:12.280> nice<00:03:12.430> and

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
don't know I think it's nice and

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.510 
don't know I think it's nice and
actually<00:03:13.989> I'm<00:03:14.050> going<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.200> move<00:03:14.320> that<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.709> I

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:15.520 
actually I'm going to move that to I

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.490 
actually I'm going to move that to I
think<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.850> sounds<00:03:15.940> well<00:03:18.120> I'll<00:03:19.120> know<00:03:19.360> it<00:03:19.570> yeah

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
think it sounds well I'll know it yeah

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.490 
think it sounds well I'll know it yeah
yeah<00:03:23.500> okay

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
yeah okay

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.140 
yeah okay
the<00:03:26.500> main<00:03:26.680> problem<00:03:27.040> with<00:03:27.070> it<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.370> I<00:03:27.459> find<00:03:27.760> is

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
the main problem with it that I find is

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.300 
the main problem with it that I find is
this<00:03:28.540> massive<00:03:28.930> section<00:03:29.440> here<00:03:29.680> with<00:03:29.890> it's<00:03:30.160> just

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
this massive section here with it's just

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.300 
this massive section here with it's just
a<00:03:30.610> lot<00:03:30.910> of<00:03:31.180> blank<00:03:31.510> spaces<00:03:31.959> kind<00:03:32.620> of<00:03:32.709> boring<00:03:32.920> so

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
a lot of blank spaces kind of boring so

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.520 
a lot of blank spaces kind of boring so
I'm<00:03:33.720> just<00:03:34.720> going<00:03:34.870> to<00:03:34.959> try<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:35.200> fill<00:03:35.380> that<00:03:35.410> I

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
I'm just going to try and fill that I

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.350 
I'm just going to try and fill that I
guess<00:03:35.920> with<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.810> two<00:03:37.810> rims<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.500> make<00:03:38.650> a<00:03:38.680> kind<00:03:39.010> of

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
guess with a two rims to make a kind of

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:49.110 
guess with a two rims to make a kind of
bouncy<00:03:40.360> snare<00:03:40.840> kind<00:03:41.170> of<00:03:41.290> sound<00:03:41.470> hood<00:03:48.120> which

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 
bouncy snare kind of sound hood which

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.729 
bouncy snare kind of sound hood which
you<00:03:49.360> can<00:03:49.510> see<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:49.780> sounds<00:03:50.050> a<00:03:50.110> lot<00:03:50.260> better<00:03:50.320> but

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:50.739 
you can see it sounds a lot better but

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.560 
you can see it sounds a lot better but
it's<00:03:51.250> still<00:03:51.430> missing<00:03:51.580> a<00:03:51.760> little<00:03:52.120> something<00:03:52.209> so

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:52.570 
it's still missing a little something so

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:54.660 
it's still missing a little something so
I<00:03:52.600> think<00:03:52.660> I'm<00:03:53.230> going<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.470> add<00:03:53.620> just<00:03:53.890> another

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
I think I'm going to add just another

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.520 
I think I'm going to add just another
snare<00:03:55.030> on<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.330> first<00:03:56.190> rimshot<00:03:57.190> so<00:03:57.550> then

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
snare on the first rimshot so then

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.590 
snare on the first rimshot so then
you<00:03:59.220> can<00:03:59.400> really<00:03:59.700> really<00:03:59.790> just<00:04:00.210> hear<00:04:00.450> that

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
you can really really just hear that

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:10.280 
you can really really just hear that
kind<00:04:00.960> of<00:04:01.220> punch<00:04:02.220> on<00:04:02.460> it<00:04:02.610> I<00:04:02.670> suppose<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:09.290> think

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
kind of punch on it I suppose so I think

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.800 
kind of punch on it I suppose so I think
that's<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.680> part<00:04:10.830> done<00:04:11.130> as<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.340> whole<00:04:11.520> but<00:04:12.000> I'm

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
that's the part done as a whole but I'm

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:14.150 
that's the part done as a whole but I'm
still<00:04:13.050> going<00:04:13.200> to<00:04:13.230> add<00:04:13.350> things<00:04:13.590> like<00:04:13.680> velocity

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
still going to add things like velocity

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.290 
still going to add things like velocity
and<00:04:14.340> just<00:04:14.490> to<00:04:14.580> make<00:04:14.670> it<00:04:14.730> sound<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.090> little<00:04:15.120> more

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
and just to make it sound a little more

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.930 
and just to make it sound a little more
a<00:04:15.630> little<00:04:16.200> more<00:04:16.320> realistic<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:17.190> I've<00:04:17.820> already

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
a little more realistic so I've already

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.490 
a little more realistic so I've already
got<00:04:18.180> it<00:04:18.209> added<00:04:18.510> on<00:04:18.630> this<00:04:18.780> snare<00:04:19.079> which<00:04:19.320> I

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
got it added on this snare which I

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.220 
got it added on this snare which I
forgot<00:04:19.859> to<00:04:19.950> take<00:04:20.100> off<00:04:20.280> but<00:04:20.910> you'll<00:04:21.900> see<00:04:22.079> what<00:04:22.170> I

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
forgot to take off but you'll see what I

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.730 
forgot to take off but you'll see what I
mean

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
mean

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.650 
mean
I'll<00:04:22.920> play<00:04:23.430> it<00:04:23.460> through<00:04:23.820> and<00:04:24.030> listen<00:04:24.480> to<00:04:24.570> this

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
I'll play it through and listen to this

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:33.290 
I'll play it through and listen to this
bit<00:04:24.870> in<00:04:24.960> particular<00:04:31.430> so<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.700> then<00:04:33.000> I'll<00:04:33.120> turn

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
bit in particular so and then I'll turn

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:41.510 
bit in particular so and then I'll turn
the<00:04:33.480> velocity<00:04:33.900> on<00:04:33.990> it<00:04:34.110> to<00:04:34.950> default<00:04:40.250> jot<00:04:41.250> I<00:04:41.280> mean

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
the velocity on it to default jot I mean

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.120 
the velocity on it to default jot I mean
it<00:04:41.640> just<00:04:41.760> it<00:04:42.030> just<00:04:42.060> sounds<00:04:42.419> a<00:04:42.810> bit<00:04:43.380> too<00:04:43.590> loud<00:04:43.800> a

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
it just it just sounds a bit too loud a

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:46.909 
it just it just sounds a bit too loud a
bit<00:04:44.400> too<00:04:44.640> like<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.690> rest<00:04:45.870> of<00:04:46.020> the<00:04:46.110> snooze<00:04:46.350> so<00:04:46.890> I

00:04:46.909 --> 00:04:46.919 
bit too like the rest of the snooze so I

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.730 
bit too like the rest of the snooze so I
think<00:04:47.070> if<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.450> draw<00:04:48.450> the<00:04:48.510> velocity<00:04:48.690> on<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.260> it

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
think if you draw the velocity on it it

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.380 
think if you draw the velocity on it it
just<00:04:49.919> helps<00:04:50.190> out<00:04:50.280> a<00:04:50.340> lot<00:04:50.580> make<00:04:50.940> it<00:04:51.090> sound<00:04:51.300> a<00:04:51.360> bit

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
just helps out a lot make it sound a bit

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.570 
just helps out a lot make it sound a bit
more<00:04:51.630> realistic<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:53.070> next<00:04:53.310> thing<00:04:53.430> I'm<00:04:53.520> going

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
more realistic the next thing I'm going

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.360 
more realistic the next thing I'm going
to<00:04:53.700> do<00:04:53.850> is<00:04:54.380> change<00:04:55.380> the<00:04:55.560> velocity<00:04:55.950> on<00:04:56.010> all<00:04:56.220> of

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
to do is change the velocity on all of

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.740 
to do is change the velocity on all of
our<00:04:56.430> hats<00:04:56.810> because<00:04:57.810> I<00:04:58.260> think<00:04:59.010> it<00:04:59.280> just<00:04:59.750> makes

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:00.750 
our hats because I think it just makes

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:02.930 
our hats because I think it just makes
makes<00:05:01.200> it<00:05:01.350> sound<00:05:01.500> a<00:05:01.680> lot<00:05:01.830> more<00:05:01.890> realistic<00:05:02.760> in

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
makes it sound a lot more realistic in

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.960 
makes it sound a lot more realistic in
human<00:05:03.500> because<00:05:04.500> obviously<00:05:04.880> humor<00:05:05.880> is<00:05:05.940> not

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
human because obviously humor is not

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.560 
human because obviously humor is not
gonna<00:05:06.150> be<00:05:06.240> able<00:05:06.419> to<00:05:06.510> hit<00:05:06.660> the<00:05:06.780> same<00:05:07.340> volume

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.570 
gonna be able to hit the same volume

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:10.820 
gonna be able to hit the same volume
over<00:05:09.570> and<00:05:09.690> over<00:05:09.870> again<00:05:09.990> for<00:05:10.350> a<00:05:10.410> long<00:05:10.530> amount<00:05:10.800> of

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:10.830 
over and over again for a long amount of

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.340 
over and over again for a long amount of
time<00:05:10.890> so<00:05:11.130> there's<00:05:11.220> going<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:11.460> be<00:05:11.580> low<00:05:12.350> not

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:13.350 
time so there's going to be low not

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:16.100 
time so there's going to be low not
mistakes<00:05:13.830> but<00:05:14.130> just<00:05:14.340> drops<00:05:14.610> in<00:05:15.020> volume<00:05:16.020> I

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
mistakes but just drops in volume I

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.740 
mistakes but just drops in volume I
guess<00:05:16.290> and<00:05:16.470> velocity<00:05:16.860> so<00:05:17.360> yeah<00:05:18.360> you'll<00:05:18.570> see

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
guess and velocity so yeah you'll see

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:25.730 
guess and velocity so yeah you'll see
what<00:05:18.900> I<00:05:18.930> mean<00:05:18.960> just<00:05:24.260> see<00:05:25.260> how<00:05:25.320> hopefully<00:05:25.650> you

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
what I mean just see how hopefully you

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.310 
what I mean just see how hopefully you
can<00:05:25.860> see<00:05:26.040> that<00:05:26.070> what<00:05:26.430> it<00:05:26.580> just<00:05:26.729> kinda<00:05:27.320> adds

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
can see that what it just kinda adds

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.770 
can see that what it just kinda adds
more<00:05:28.650> of<00:05:28.800> a<00:05:29.960> human<00:05:30.960> sound<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.620> it<00:05:31.740> I<00:05:31.830> guess<00:05:32.780> and

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
more of a human sound to it I guess and

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:42.230 
more of a human sound to it I guess and
let's<00:05:34.290> play<00:05:34.440> it<00:05:34.590> all<00:05:34.740> as<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.220> whole<00:05:41.240> hopefully

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.240 
let's play it all as a whole hopefully

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
let's play it all as a whole hopefully
you<00:05:42.300> can<00:05:42.390> see<00:05:42.479> what<00:05:42.630> I'm<00:05:42.690> talking<00:05:42.720> about<00:05:43.020> in

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:43.260 
you can see what I'm talking about in

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.170 
you can see what I'm talking about in
realism<00:05:43.710> and<00:05:43.770> things<00:05:43.979> like<00:05:44.100> that<00:05:44.160> I<00:05:44.490> mean<00:05:44.910> it

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 
realism and things like that I mean it

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:46.219 
realism and things like that I mean it
might<00:05:45.360> not<00:05:45.390> be<00:05:45.570> the<00:05:45.660> best<00:05:45.780> pie<00:05:45.990> in<00:05:46.020> the<00:05:46.200> world

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
might not be the best pie in the world

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.690 
might not be the best pie in the world
but<00:05:46.470> I've<00:05:46.590> only<00:05:46.650> made<00:05:47.070> it<00:05:47.190> in<00:05:47.250> a<00:05:47.310> short<00:05:47.520> amount

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:47.700 
but I've only made it in a short amount

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
but I've only made it in a short amount
of<00:05:47.790> time<00:05:48.080> so<00:05:49.080> hopefully<00:05:50.210> you've<00:05:51.210> kind<00:05:51.600> of

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:51.720 
of time so hopefully you've kind of

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.330 
of time so hopefully you've kind of
changed<00:05:52.020> mine<00:05:52.169> up<00:05:52.320> a<00:05:52.410> bit<00:05:52.590> just<00:05:52.830> so<00:05:52.950> it's<00:05:53.250> not

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340 
changed mine up a bit just so it's not

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.620 
changed mine up a bit just so it's not
the<00:05:53.490> same<00:05:53.669> as<00:05:53.820> everyone's<00:05:54.180> watching<00:05:54.540> this
