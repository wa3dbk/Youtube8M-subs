00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
and that is basically how I fill in my

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.849 
and that is basically how I fill in my
brows<00:04:17.940> you<00:04:18.359> can<00:04:18.390> probably<00:04:18.780> see<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.560> noticeable

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
brows you can probably see a noticeable

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.259 
brows you can probably see a noticeable
difference<00:04:20.100> from<00:04:20.549> the<00:04:20.700> beginning<00:04:21.030> of<00:04:21.120> the

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
difference from the beginning of the

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.120 
difference from the beginning of the
video<00:04:21.390> to<00:04:21.600> the<00:04:21.780> end<00:04:21.810> they<00:04:22.740> are<00:04:22.770> a<00:04:22.920> little

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
video to the end they are a little

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.970 
video to the end they are a little
darker<00:04:23.670> little<00:04:24.090> filled<00:04:24.450> in<00:04:24.630> more<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:25.500> little

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
darker little filled in more a little

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.600 
darker little filled in more a little
more<00:04:26.100> precise<00:04:26.490> so<00:04:27.450> um<00:04:28.170> I<00:04:28.230> actually<00:04:28.680> never

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
more precise so um I actually never

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.670 
more precise so um I actually never
really<00:04:29.940> filled<00:04:30.270> in<00:04:30.360> my<00:04:30.480> brows<00:04:30.720> until<00:04:31.350> maybe<00:04:31.590> a

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
really filled in my brows until maybe a

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.220 
really filled in my brows until maybe a
month<00:04:31.890> or<00:04:31.980> two<00:04:32.160> ago<00:04:32.190> I<00:04:32.670> honestly<00:04:33.390> did<00:04:33.990> not<00:04:34.110> see

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
month or two ago I honestly did not see

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.960 
month or two ago I honestly did not see
the<00:04:34.320> point<00:04:34.560> in<00:04:34.740> it<00:04:34.860> I<00:04:35.070> just<00:04:35.160> thought<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:35.820> was<00:04:35.910> a

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
the point in it I just thought it was a

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.900 
the point in it I just thought it was a
chore<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:36.690> didn't<00:04:36.990> really<00:04:37.200> like<00:04:37.950> the<00:04:38.220> look<00:04:38.430> but

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
chore I didn't really like the look but

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.000 
chore I didn't really like the look but
I<00:04:39.090> actually<00:04:39.240> liked<00:04:39.600> how<00:04:39.810> it<00:04:39.840> turned<00:04:40.230> out<00:04:40.440> so

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.010 
I actually liked how it turned out so

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.180 
I actually liked how it turned out so
I've<00:04:41.550> gotten<00:04:41.970> into<00:04:42.300> it<00:04:42.420> a<00:04:42.480> little<00:04:42.660> more<00:04:42.810> so<00:04:43.740> I

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190
