here<00:00:01.530> is<00:00:01.650> another<00:00:01.920> lymph<00:00:02.280> node<00:00:02.610> you<00:00:02.939> can<00:00:03.120> see

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
here is another lymph node you can see

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.999 
here is another lymph node you can see
that<00:00:03.510> instantly<00:00:04.140> you<00:00:04.560> can<00:00:04.589> see<00:00:04.830> it's

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
that instantly you can see it's

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.330 
that instantly you can see it's
surrounded<00:00:05.490> by<00:00:05.569> fat<00:00:06.569> you<00:00:07.440> could<00:00:07.620> see<00:00:07.859> even<00:00:08.189> at

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
surrounded by fat you could see even at

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.000 
surrounded by fat you could see even at
this<00:00:08.519> pout<00:00:08.790> that<00:00:09.000> it<00:00:09.120> appears<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.480> have<00:00:09.660> a<00:00:09.719> nice

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:10.010 
this pout that it appears to have a nice

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.070 
this pout that it appears to have a nice
fibrous<00:00:11.010> capsule<00:00:11.309> you<00:00:12.150> can<00:00:12.179> also<00:00:12.480> notice<00:00:13.049> that

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
fibrous capsule you can also notice that

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.680 
fibrous capsule you can also notice that
in<00:00:13.380> this<00:00:13.559> particular<00:00:14.009> lymph<00:00:14.549> node<00:00:14.820> there

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
in this particular lymph node there

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.090 
in this particular lymph node there
appears<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.289> be<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.910> predominance<00:00:17.910> of

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
appears to be a predominance of

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.750 
appears to be a predominance of
follicles<00:00:20.270> in<00:00:21.270> which<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.689> follicles<00:00:22.350> are

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:22.760 
follicles in which the follicles are

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.750 
follicles in which the follicles are
more<00:00:23.760> numerous<00:00:24.420> and<00:00:25.130> larger<00:00:26.130> than<00:00:26.580> they

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
more numerous and larger than they

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.900 
more numerous and larger than they
usually<00:00:26.939> are<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.830> appear<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:28.859> take<00:00:29.310> up<00:00:29.580> more

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
usually are and appear to take up more

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:31.759 
usually are and appear to take up more
of<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> lymph<00:00:30.420> node<00:00:30.689> than<00:00:30.929> just<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.289> cortex

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
of the lymph node than just the cortex

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.180 
of the lymph node than just the cortex
so<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.099> is<00:00:32.219> a<00:00:32.360> follicular<00:00:33.710> hyperplasia<00:00:34.710> one

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
so this is a follicular hyperplasia one

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.910 
so this is a follicular hyperplasia one
of<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.520> two<00:00:35.700> common<00:00:36.120> forms<00:00:36.149> of<00:00:37.010> Adhan<00:00:38.010> itis

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
of the two common forms of Adhan itis

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.280 
of the two common forms of Adhan itis
medullary<00:00:40.920> or<00:00:41.280> histiocytic<00:00:42.180> or<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> reticular

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
medullary or histiocytic or a reticular

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.670 
medullary or histiocytic or a reticular
hyperplasia<00:00:43.950> or<00:00:44.190> sinus<00:00:44.820> histiocytosis<00:00:45.680> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
hyperplasia or sinus histiocytosis the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.020 
hyperplasia or sinus histiocytosis the
preferred<00:00:47.129> term<00:00:47.460> is<00:00:48.410> the<00:00:49.410> other<00:00:49.530> type<00:00:50.030> notice

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
preferred term is the other type notice

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.270 
preferred term is the other type notice
that<00:00:51.180> in<00:00:51.360> this<00:00:51.510> lymph<00:00:51.870> node<00:00:52.140> we<00:00:52.829> would<00:00:53.010> never

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
that in this lymph node we would never

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.310 
that in this lymph node we would never
think<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:53.699> there<00:00:54.030> was<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.210> lymphoma<00:00:54.719> going<00:00:55.140> on

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
think that there was a lymphoma going on

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.170 
think that there was a lymphoma going on
because<00:00:55.680> we<00:00:55.800> could<00:00:55.949> see<00:00:55.980> nice<00:00:56.340> follicles<00:00:57.000> a

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
because we could see nice follicles a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.619 
because we could see nice follicles a
nice<00:00:57.360> capsule<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.199> sub<00:00:58.859> capsular<00:00:59.399> cyanus<00:00:59.940> but

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
nice capsule a sub capsular cyanus but

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.380 
nice capsule a sub capsular cyanus but
take<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> look<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.570> maybe<00:01:03.570> here<00:01:04.290> and

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:05.390 
take a look like here and maybe here and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.490 
take a look like here and maybe here and
maybe<00:01:06.390> areas<00:01:07.020> like<00:01:07.260> this<00:01:07.619> and<00:01:09.020> I<00:01:10.020> would<00:01:10.170> really

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
maybe areas like this and I would really

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.340 
maybe areas like this and I would really
want<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:11.030> find<00:01:12.030> this<00:01:12.270> nice<00:01:12.570> ones<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.229> you

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
want to find this nice ones for you

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.340 
want to find this nice ones for you
these<00:01:13.560> little<00:01:13.799> areas<00:01:14.369> like<00:01:14.850> here<00:01:15.270> in<00:01:15.420> which

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
these little areas like here in which

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.670 
these little areas like here in which
you<00:01:16.590> have<00:01:16.890> little<00:01:17.220> clusters<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.500> what<00:01:19.500> look

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
you have little clusters of what look

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.749 
you have little clusters of what look
like<00:01:19.710> histiocytes

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
like histiocytes

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.640 
like histiocytes
and<00:01:20.909> it's<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:21.600> they<00:01:21.720> are<00:01:21.900> histiocytes

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
and it's because they are histiocytes

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.480 
and it's because they are histiocytes
like<00:01:23.520> here<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.650> they<00:01:25.650> are<00:01:25.770> definitely<00:01:26.100> not

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
like here and they are definitely not

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.550 
like here and they are definitely not
little<00:01:27.150> germinal<00:01:27.689> centers<00:01:28.110> because<00:01:28.380> they're

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
little germinal centers because they're

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:36.080 
little germinal centers because they're
not<00:01:28.740> surrounded<00:01:29.490> by<00:01:32.090> mantle<00:01:33.090> lymphocytes<00:01:35.090> but

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
not surrounded by mantle lymphocytes but

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.429 
not surrounded by mantle lymphocytes but
when<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> see<00:01:36.479> these<00:01:36.600> little<00:01:36.900> clusters<00:01:37.200> like

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
when you see these little clusters like

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.399 
when you see these little clusters like
this<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.189> they're<00:01:39.150> not<00:01:39.180> giant<00:01:39.689> cells<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
this and they're not giant cells and

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.460 
this and they're not giant cells and
they're<00:01:40.500> not<00:01:40.650> really<00:01:40.890> granulomas<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:43.259> is

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
they're not really granulomas this is

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.660 
they're not really granulomas this is
often<00:01:43.770> a<00:01:44.310> very<00:01:44.369> very<00:01:45.240> very<00:01:45.720> almost<00:01:46.670> diagnostic

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
often a very very very almost diagnostic

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.240 
often a very very very almost diagnostic
of<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.810> type<00:01:49.170> of<00:01:50.000> lymphadenitis<00:01:51.000> in<00:01:51.390> which

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
of a type of lymphadenitis in which

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:58.039 
of a type of lymphadenitis in which
Toxoplasma<00:01:53.250> gondii<00:01:54.240> eye<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:55.040> the<00:01:56.040> cause<00:01:57.049> to

Toxoplasma gondii eye is the cause to

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.749 
Toxoplasma gondii eye is the cause to
make<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> long<00:01:58.469> story<00:01:58.710> short<00:01:58.860> if<00:01:59.369> you<00:01:59.490> showed

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
make a long story short if you showed

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.139 
make a long story short if you showed

this field instantly to a lymph node
pathologist<00:02:04.110> he<00:02:04.259> would<00:02:04.380> say<00:02:04.560> toxo<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.490> just

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
pathologist he would say toxo and just

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.969 
pathologist he would say toxo and just
go<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.479> to<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.780> next<00:02:07.020> case<00:02:07.259> because<00:02:07.680> if<00:02:07.860> you

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
go on to the next case because if you

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.479 
go on to the next case because if you
actually<00:02:08.399> stained<00:02:08.700> some<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.690> these<00:02:09.840> little

actually stained some of these little

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.980 
actually stained some of these little
distinct<00:02:11.489> clusters<00:02:11.840> they<00:02:12.840> could<00:02:13.050> very<00:02:13.290> easily

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
distinct clusters they could very easily

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.810 
distinct clusters they could very easily
up<00:02:14.250> showing<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.570> toxoplasmosis<00:02:16.570> Gandhi<00:02:17.230> I

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.280 
up showing you toxoplasmosis Gandhi I
that's<00:02:18.820> all<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.060> wanted<00:02:19.540> to<00:02:19.600> say<00:02:19.900> thank<00:02:20.170> you
