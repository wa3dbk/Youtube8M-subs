00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:04.760 

so<00:00:03.179> this<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:03.510> looking<00:00:03.629> at<00:00:03.840> the<00:00:03.959> audio<00:00:04.319> Airness

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
so this is looking at the audio Airness

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:06.349 
so this is looking at the audio Airness
of<00:00:05.100> where<00:00:05.279> they<00:00:05.400> are<00:00:05.580> when<00:00:05.850> they're<00:00:06.000> upside

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
of where they are when they're upside

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.280 
of where they are when they're upside
down<00:00:07.580> just<00:00:08.580> basic<00:00:09.059> gymnastics<00:00:09.240> such<00:00:10.110> as

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
down just basic gymnastics such as

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.650 
down just basic gymnastics such as
cartwheels<00:00:13.400> so<00:00:14.400> we<00:00:14.549> need<00:00:14.759> to<00:00:15.000> remember

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
cartwheels so we need to remember

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.480 
cartwheels so we need to remember
dorsiflexion<00:00:16.650> throughout<00:00:17.070> all<00:00:17.250> of<00:00:17.279> our

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
dorsiflexion throughout all of our

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.179 
dorsiflexion throughout all of our
drills<00:00:17.990> this<00:00:18.990> adds<00:00:19.289> to<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.770> running

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
drills this adds to the running

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.560 
drills this adds to the running
mechanics<00:00:22.850> back<00:00:23.850> was<00:00:24.000> are<00:00:24.060> also<00:00:24.150> hands<00:00:24.390> down

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
mechanics back was are also hands down

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.550 
mechanics back was are also hands down
with<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:24.720> push<00:00:24.930> off<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.470> nice<00:00:25.619> pike<00:00:27.349> so<00:00:28.349> this

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
with a push off and a nice pike so this

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.769 
with a push off and a nice pike so this
is<00:00:28.710> looking<00:00:28.830> at<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.160> top<00:00:29.730> end<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.269> vault

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
is looking at the top end of the vault

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.900 
is looking at the top end of the vault
try<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.080> to<00:00:31.109> flick<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.470> feet<00:00:31.619> so<00:00:31.769> much<00:00:31.949> that's

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
try not to flick the feet so much that's

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.900 
try not to flick the feet so much that's
it<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.600> we're<00:00:33.750> really<00:00:34.050> driving<00:00:34.380> up<00:00:34.800> and<00:00:35.280> into

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it so we're really driving up and into

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.270 
it so we're really driving up and into
the<00:00:36.030> pike<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.480> if<00:00:36.600> we're<00:00:36.780> going<00:00:36.960> over<00:00:37.280> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
the pike as if we're going over the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.420 
the pike as if we're going over the
bungee<00:00:38.670> or<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.820> bar<00:00:42.500> that's<00:00:43.500> it<00:00:43.800> good<00:00:44.040> core

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
bungee or the bar that's it good core

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.950 
bungee or the bar that's it good core
and<00:00:44.670> body<00:00:44.850> tension<00:00:45.420> throughout<00:00:45.719> the

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
and body tension throughout the

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.050 
and body tension throughout the
extension<00:00:46.530> at<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.710> top

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:54.060 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.550 

much<00:00:55.060> more<00:00:55.270> difficult<00:00:55.480> progression<00:00:56.260> of<00:00:56.410> this

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560 
much more difficult progression of this

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.160 
much more difficult progression of this
is<00:00:56.950> to<00:00:57.370> do<00:00:57.880> a<00:00:57.910> backwards<00:00:58.360> roll<00:00:58.480> to<00:00:58.600> handstand

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
is to do a backwards roll to handstand

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.630 
is to do a backwards roll to handstand
into<00:00:59.920> a<00:01:00.130> half<00:01:00.430> turn<00:01:00.760> and<00:01:01.120> then<00:01:01.810> roll<00:01:02.050> out<00:01:02.260> of<00:01:02.290> it

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
into a half turn and then roll out of it

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.310 
into a half turn and then roll out of it
so<00:01:03.640> this<00:01:03.850> is<00:01:03.910> working<00:01:04.240> on<00:01:04.480> a<00:01:04.540> push<00:01:04.780> off<00:01:04.960> the<00:01:05.080> top

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
so this is working on a push off the top

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.040 
so this is working on a push off the top
and<00:01:05.470> a<00:01:05.740> turn<00:01:06.010> so<00:01:06.370> once<00:01:06.550> again<00:01:06.760> looking<00:01:07.690> at<00:01:07.840> how

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
and a turn so once again looking at how

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:20.780 
and a turn so once again looking at how
we<00:01:08.110> use<00:01:08.320> our<00:01:08.350> body<00:01:08.680> at<00:01:08.950> the<00:01:09.040> top<00:01:09.280> of<00:01:09.460> the<00:01:09.550> vault

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.969 

and<00:01:21.790> last<00:01:22.780> one<00:01:23.050> just<00:01:23.080> walking<00:01:23.560> on<00:01:23.680> your<00:01:23.770> hands

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
and last one just walking on your hands

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.219 
and last one just walking on your hands
so<00:01:24.760> now<00:01:24.910> we're<00:01:25.090> just<00:01:25.120> testing<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.870> upper<00:01:26.080> body

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
so now we're just testing the upper body

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:29.070 
so now we're just testing the upper body
strength<00:01:26.590> body<00:01:26.950> control<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:28.660> getting<00:01:28.960> them

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
strength body control and getting them

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.469 
strength body control and getting them
used<00:01:29.260> to<00:01:29.550> using<00:01:30.550> their<00:01:30.700> upper<00:01:30.970> body<00:01:31.180> and<00:01:31.360> core

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
used to using their upper body and core

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.750 
used to using their upper body and core
throughout<00:01:32.110> a<00:01:32.140> movement<00:01:32.500> basic<00:01:33.369> strengths

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:33.760 
throughout a movement basic strengths

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:47.350 
throughout a movement basic strengths
exercise

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:02:06.690 

your<00:01:48.360> body<00:01:48.659> control<00:01:49.520> keep<00:01:50.520> it<00:01:50.700> going

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.810 

super<00:02:07.600> well<00:02:07.780> done
