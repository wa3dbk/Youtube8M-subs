figured i'm growing my hair out so I'm

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.349 
figured i'm growing my hair out so I'm
abetted<00:00:35.730> minus<00:00:36.149> look<00:00:36.359> at<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.629> extra<00:00:37.019> long<00:00:37.170> um

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:38.359 
abetted minus look at the extra long um

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:42.259 
abetted minus look at the extra long um
the<00:00:39.359> only<00:00:39.390> difference<00:00:39.899> between<00:00:41.149> orange<00:00:42.149> and

00:00:42.259 --> 00:00:42.269 
the only difference between orange and

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.310 
the only difference between orange and
the<00:00:42.329> pink<00:00:42.359> I<00:00:44.000> honestly<00:00:45.000> don't<00:00:45.390> even<00:00:45.539> know<00:00:45.809> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
the pink I honestly don't even know the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.319 
the pink I honestly don't even know the
difference<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:47.010> think<00:00:47.789> these<00:00:47.940> might<00:00:48.120> be<00:00:48.300> a

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
difference I think these might be a

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.250 
difference I think these might be a
little<00:00:48.449> bit<00:00:48.660> longer<00:00:50.629> but<00:00:51.629> there's<00:00:51.839> not<00:00:51.989> a<00:00:52.019> big

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
little bit longer but there's not a big

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.619 
little bit longer but there's not a big
difference<00:00:52.559> between<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:53.010> two<00:00:53.129> colors<00:00:53.570> and<00:00:54.570> it

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
difference between the two colors and it

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.599 
difference between the two colors and it
comes<00:00:54.839> with<00:00:55.019> six<00:00:55.679> in<00:00:55.859> a<00:00:55.920> pack<00:00:56.100> if<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.399> get<00:00:56.519> the

00:00:56.599 --> 00:00:56.609 
comes with six in a pack if you get the

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.400 
comes with six in a pack if you get the
extra<00:00:56.850> long<00:00:56.999> and<00:00:57.179> wide<00:00:57.269> and<00:00:57.539> eat<00:00:57.870> in<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.170> pack<00:00:58.379> if

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
extra long and wide and eat in a pack if

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.959 
extra long and wide and eat in a pack if
you<00:00:58.710> get<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.129> just<00:00:59.999> long<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.179> wide<00:01:00.510> um<00:01:01.969> so

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
you get the just long and wide um so

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.640 
you get the just long and wide um so
yeah<00:01:03.089> I<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.539> might<00:01:03.719> go<00:01:03.749> get<00:01:04.140> another<00:01:04.379> pack

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
yeah I think I might go get another pack

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.320 
yeah I think I might go get another pack
because<00:01:04.830> I<00:01:05.070> still<00:01:05.370> don't<00:01:05.580> have<00:01:05.760> enough<00:01:05.790> for<00:01:06.240> my

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
because I still don't have enough for my

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.220 
because I still don't have enough for my
back<00:01:06.570> which<00:01:07.410> is<00:01:07.560> kind<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:07.860> crazy<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.610> um<00:01:09.230> you

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.450 

as<00:04:38.200> you<00:04:38.410> can<00:04:38.530> see<00:04:38.680> after<00:04:38.920> you<00:04:38.950> tug<00:04:39.190> it<00:04:39.340> it<00:04:39.430> just

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
as you can see after you tug it it just

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:42.060

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
rolls right up most of the time so I

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.490 
rolls right up most of the time so I
only<00:04:42.460> do<00:04:42.760> try<00:04:43.570> and<00:04:43.690> just<00:04:43.840> do<00:04:43.930> two<00:04:44.170> on<00:04:44.320> each<00:04:44.470> side

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
so there's too much hair and i wanted to

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.220 
so there's too much hair and i wanted to
get<00:04:59.980> a<00:05:00.280> little<00:05:00.580> bit<00:05:00.790> farther<00:05:01.030> back<00:05:01.330> so<00:05:02.080> i'm

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:02.230 
get a little bit farther back so i'm

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:05.450 
get a little bit farther back so i'm
just<00:05:02.290> going<00:05:02.470> to<00:05:02.530> take<00:05:02.820> the<00:05:03.820> section<00:05:04.240> of<00:05:04.330> town

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
just going to take the section of town

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:09.020 
just going to take the section of town
i'm<00:05:06.460> just<00:05:06.820> going<00:05:06.940> to<00:05:07.000> make<00:05:07.300> one<00:05:07.360> more<00:05:07.720> section

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
i'm just going to make one more section

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.120 
i'm just going to make one more section
on<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:10.090> side<00:05:10.540> that<00:05:10.900> has<00:05:11.170> more<00:05:11.410> hair<00:05:11.620> just

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
on the side that has more hair just

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.340 
on the side that has more hair just
because<00:05:12.400> otherwise<00:05:12.700> the<00:05:13.570> curls<00:05:13.900> don't<00:05:14.140> go<00:05:14.290> to

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
because otherwise the curls don't go to

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:33.490 
because otherwise the curls don't go to
the<00:05:14.590> roots<00:05:14.830> and<00:05:14.980> it<00:05:15.130> looks<00:05:15.280> kind<00:05:15.550> of<00:05:15.610> funny

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:40.170 

 for<00:06:35.380> me<00:06:35.590> I<00:06:36.450> tell<00:06:37.450> the<00:06:37.660> fire

00:06:40.170 --> 00:06:40.180 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.939 

so<00:06:41.180> that's<00:06:41.389> the<00:06:41.509> final<00:06:41.930> result<00:06:42.319> I<00:06:42.469> like<00:06:42.710> how<00:06:42.830> it

so that's the final result I like how it
turns<00:06:43.159> out<00:06:43.279> on<00:06:43.430> this<00:06:43.550> side<00:06:43.759> better<00:06:43.879> than<00:06:44.119> this

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
turns out on this side better than this

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:47.140 
turns out on this side better than this
one<00:06:44.599> I<00:06:44.779> don't<00:06:45.020> know<00:06:45.139> why<00:06:45.349> but<00:06:45.740> I<00:06:46.279> can't<00:06:46.879> ever

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:47.150

curlformers<00:06:56.960> in<00:06:57.379> for<00:06:57.559> another<00:06:57.680> like<00:06:57.979> 30-45

00:06:58.809 --> 00:06:58.819 
curlformers in for another like 30-45

00:06:58.819 --> 00:07:01.209 
curlformers in for another like 30-45
minutes<00:06:59.270> and<00:06:59.479> then<00:07:00.199> I<00:07:00.289> pulled<00:07:00.559> my<00:07:00.710> bangs<00:07:00.949> back

00:07:01.209 --> 00:07:01.219 
minutes and then I pulled my bangs back

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:04.570 
minutes and then I pulled my bangs back
because<00:07:01.639> my<00:07:02.569> bangs<00:07:02.779> are<00:07:02.930> bugging<00:07:03.259> me<00:07:03.439> um<00:07:03.680> so

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:04.580 
because my bangs are bugging me um so

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.279 
because my bangs are bugging me um so
this<00:07:04.729> is<00:07:04.849> kind<00:07:05.180> of<00:07:05.240> the<00:07:05.479> finished<00:07:06.229> look
