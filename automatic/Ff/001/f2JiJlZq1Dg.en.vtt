00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:06.110
 and who are we here aggressiveness them 

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.300
 I'm going to talk about two dystopian books and 

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.580
 these books are pure weak in new 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.959
 cork and although the fallen of his saint and 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.030
 good that we are told that those who 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:17.030
 are three falls tells us about a 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.849
 dystopian futuristic world in which the 

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.619
 angels declared him the aggregate of the 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:24.019
 humans just went down one day and 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.029
 they said is that they gave us the order of 

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:27.980
 destroy them the order of the angel 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.919
 gabriel created really likes a book 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.230
 a long time ago and our protagonist 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.969
 it is partridge that is the channel of living day to 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.399
 day together with his sister who has a 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.140
 disability together with your mom who is 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:42.620
 like the typical religious she 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.899
 he believes in me and I in me those things and 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.149
 good one day the angels just 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.460
 kidnap the sister of permit and then 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.920
 permís decides to go find her sister and 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:54.050
 on the way there is a rafael 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.820
 fallen angel that has just been removed 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.800
 making it all to forgive is a 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.539
 effort so much Rafael needs someone 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.910
 that you will know about all the rooms 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:03.949
 and there remains 7 what's behind sister 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.380
 then they like forces for 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:08.380
 big here is the ferry sister and 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.490
 and well, more or less, it's my scoop and 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.110
 the story for the brain mom is 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.180
 that they do not explain to me why the 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.190
 things because simply the angels a 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.840
 day they decided to pass and attack the 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.520
 humans I know that maybe he explains it to me 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.020
 in the second book but I feel that this 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.210
 book is the introducer then that I 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.100
 should follow a little bit because it is 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.110
 what is doing obviously not all 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.360
 the reasons but as if the idea 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.550
 main thing I do not know what god one day 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.950
 he said I disappointed humans as well 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:39.530
 that they are going to attack them or something like that they do not use 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.869
 I just even lose and ask 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.820
 one day I think rafael or just 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.320
 know the question of why everything happened is 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.720
 happier after we got the order and 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.180
 already then 2000 was what I did not like 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.640
 I felt that it is a defect and it is a people 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.970
 that did not convince me of the book yet I 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:58.429
 he liked the fact of the fallen angels and 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.009
 of the whole plot that goes on because it 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.990
 are carrying the sister of fher rivers 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.890
 they do not fully explain it to you, but they 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.690
 I made this concept very interesting and 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.569
 If I want to read the second I tell you already 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:16.420
 I would like to know again why 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:18.370
 and I would really like to see if it is that I 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.470
 will explain why this happens because 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.540
 I tell them I can laugh all day but for 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:26.769
 what do not explain to me why this happened 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.959
 so if I do not say 4 out of 5 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.060
 because if he entertained me and I liked it and 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.920
 I liked the concept but I did not like the 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.689
 you did not explain things to me well 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.150
 Well, if you can go for that one 

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:39.189
 book now let's move to wall of 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.470
 generator is a recommendation of a 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.659
 little friend gibran of the canal and in Milan and 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.280
 Well, he really likes this book 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:47.680
 from the best gift in order to 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.170
 cycle and read and return to a face like 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.239
 him but this iron has many 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.579
 problems for me history speaks to us 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.129
 about a dystopian monkey in which some 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.840
 detonations and people who 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:01.420
 they were affected by this detonations 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.829
 they merged as objects people or 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.079
 anything they have been 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:07.420
 around them at this time by 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:10.150
 others to people who after suffering 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.489
 these mergers because they were from a 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.340
 dome that the government had organized 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.640
 to protect yourself because you've waited in 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.310
 this 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.620
 prayers and they did not suffer any 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.260
 formation no problem or anything like that 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.120
 all that is why they are called pure 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:28.870
 our protagonists are appreciates and 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.640
 perdés appreciates is a person who was 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.620
 outside and receive the detonations 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.870
 then it would be worked in that 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.180
 moment like your doll with the head of 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.820
 his wrist they were what he brought when 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.300
 this happened and she lives together with her 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:46.330
 Grandpa is like that lost them 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:48.160
 they just live day by day and she like 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.870
 who is very afraid of the world and 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.110
 another side we have lost that he is 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.239
 a cigar that is a dad is like the leader 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:56.950
 of the dome that has always lived with 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.769
 the idea that his mom died for 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.170
 save other people and help them 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.900
 enter the dome but all this is going to 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:07.720
 change when he finds out that his mom 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.489
 could be alive and he decides to leave 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.380
 the dome and that's where it is 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:14.709
 he appreciates because he appreciates they call those of 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.900
 the dome to find a partridge and there 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.310
 is when your stories are going to 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.620
 deliver and they will discover 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.389
 really what happened 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.979
 for certain things that happened 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.840
 detonations what happened to mom's 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.810
 partridge what is it that the 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.970
 papa and paris with the people what is it that 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.410
 is going on with his part he did not know and 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.080
 any that more or less to the plot 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:37.660
 this book to me the truth is the world 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.190
 it made very raw came out after I did not have 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.380
 many problems of these although it took 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.600
 more week reading this book because 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.820
 also the translation is not very good or 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.290
 munich ave and the truth I'm not sure 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:49.180
 to go the translation with the ways of 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.460
 that writing also in very crude books 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.610
 but I liked it already was a descriptions 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.789
 very chaotic yes very crisis that was of 

00:04:54.610 --> 00:05:00.100
 acidity and I know you can not advance 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.169
 simply for that because really I 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.389
 I did not know what I was doing when writing 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:07.419
 things then that I really like 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.039
 the writing I tell you for me the side not 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:10.870
 I liked that it's about the fruit of 

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:13.240
 world although it's very well done very 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.800
 well developed that world and the moment 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.169
 the fish interested in the book at the point 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:19.479
 that you discover like this helps because there 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:21.220
 a turn to what you have not been seeing 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:23.530
 come but that also a little bit 

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.080
 predictable because you get to know about 

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.860
 these you check listening to a story you 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.479
 he is counting 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.389
 Partridge that his mom and I told him 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.900
 when it 's okay he told us I already know what 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.400
 It will happen 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.530
 millás simply made me very 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.449
 predictable or even it was a turn that I 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:42.039
 he liked it quite I think he gave this 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:44.259
 woman to the book and yes I liked the fact 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:46.689
 that kept me interested from 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:49.210
 that moment to know what was happening and creating 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:51.639
 that was going to pass the end really I 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.939
 he liked it a lot because it gives you a feeling of 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:57.789
 hope although it is a very raw world 

00:05:54.939 --> 00:05:59.830
 you have that touch of hope of a 

00:05:57.789 --> 00:06:01.120
 luxurious at the end of the road then that 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:03.099
 I liked it a lot because that's what I 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.740
 love of books even though there 

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:08.289
 as it was dystopia cruelty in the 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:10.599
 world as that expected touch was what 

00:06:08.289 --> 00:06:12.430
 that I liked a lot because I 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.409
 I said this book is not going to have love and 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.889
 final if I had love and I liked it 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:20.740
 much about that book I read 495 in 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:22.539
 curry because I liked it dispensed me from 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:25.449
 I had that same interesting one that 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:27.250
 they put on and off later 

00:06:25.449 --> 00:06:28.120
 I really did not find the easy opinion 

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:30.970
 read 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.100
 but it did not reach 5 because I tell them the 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.680
 world is muscle for me the description 

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:37.780
 they are very strong they are very precise where 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.410
 the game every single effect and that I do not 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:43.090
 I liked it but the rest I liked a lot 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:44.800
 I tell them if I want to continue the saga and 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:47.080
 Well yes that's all I can do 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:50.020
 say thank you very much for having me 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:52.540
 I liked the book but I did not like it 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.220
 still not me but maybe the second one 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.860
 they say it 's better then we come 

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.240
 what's up, what happens and well yes that's all 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.979
 the commented the radio has left me 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.889
 some two books if they like it or if not 

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:05.350
 they liked it also did not decide spoilers 

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:07.120
 so that people do not sneak in but 

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:19.620
 tell me what you think our books 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:19.620
 and then if that's what there is
