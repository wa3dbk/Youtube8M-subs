00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.930
 hello to you azaz 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.070
 if we keep going gta liberty 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.820
 city ​​stories 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.389
 we have another mission 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.940
 radio controlled cars 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:21.420
 where we will need a fuse well either 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.660
 just move a row so van that 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.189
 is here here too in portland 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.100
 gums island where you are right away 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.769
 two sweep on typewriters this is the port he 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.340
 it turns out sit down offer it is called p 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.590
 sisters from then un sense very simple 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.780
 need to blow more than 20 row for each 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.719
 killing gives us a bonus time that is 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.149
 time increases it bring it 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.030
 completely dependent on luck i.e. 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:51.180
 next to sleep the next 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.090
 happens not to sleep like a long time here 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.030
 there are now running you can catch them 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.550
 here are the virgins 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:02.399
 fuse on circle move well this 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.360
 clear and remember never blow 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.909
 your van 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.409
 yes your van in which you sit because 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.639
 what if you call the mission be 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.520
 I just failed so and and 

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:16.549
 was very unexpected to me I 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.429
 completely forgot about it 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:24.179
 give pedestrians and hours of delirium and apsten 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:28.709
 crashed for 10 seconds and it seems obvious 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:33.529
 I would fail under mission 431 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:33.529
 well, well, it will be a powerful charge 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:41.869
 no, all the same, see how I still resist 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:48.439
 In the same where the ranks forgot but a number of trya 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:52.330
 yes come here 1 2 3 so here you see suspension 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:56.060
 on such on such a face and thin 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.189
 you will not find much about what I am now 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.310
 lucky literally at the last second and 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:06.049
 count them blew up here now we where you 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:09.860
 triad but already so good 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.709
 two I still prefer to blow up so 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.420
 like a wave 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.959
 tantamount to i see see it seems not 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:18.830
 loss 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.170
 well, well, well, well, we drive up everything is fine 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.360
 20 as I understand it is necessary all the same 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:28.250
 blow one bigger 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:31.519
 times there are more than 20 we already have 22 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.930
 he three more I see I do not know what will happen 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:39.019
 if you blow up gray 40 or whos there 3050 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.130
 so theoretically possible but will give it 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:43.010
 any bonus 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:47.630
 i don't know i never exploded a lot to me 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:49.190
 20 was enough and everything was as though I was pleased at 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.250
 actually sweep up such a pretty 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:54.489
 merry blow up go for here 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:57.230
 so now you can still dial 10 seconds 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:03:01.250
 although you see I was there again on the verge 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:04.280
 now i'm no longer can still see everything 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:09.079
 better blow up chapter 31 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:12.380
 notice the time I’ll get about this 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:16.269
 strange really like time becomes 

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:20.560
 as if invisible to make it harder 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:23.889
 No, this is already my record 36 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.060
 I think this is a good result and 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.549
 constantly turn around like that too 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.230
 see not spun very often straight 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.950
 dam not asthmatics time appeared 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.000
 back very strange now I was not 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:40.540
 know why 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.890
 39 I think it was right on the verge once 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:47.860
 lose but more than forty scored 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:50.860
 believe it for me is an achievement 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.700
 to put it mildly so we may now 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.880
 appears behind no then appeared in on 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.900
 now it will be a loss I don’t think that I 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.920
 find some 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.640
 treat here to 41 I find it more than 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.850
 quite a new record and they give us 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:13.540
 a thousand dollars so here I literally 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:16.000
 almost lost but still victory is 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:18.400
 in my opinion the main thing well, thank you 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.640

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.430
