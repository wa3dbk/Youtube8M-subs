00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
got about 30 drivers equate I would say

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.390 
got about 30 drivers equate I would say
they're<00:03:35.260> from<00:03:35.290> intermediate<00:03:35.770> to<00:03:36.010> pro<00:03:36.160> class

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
they're from intermediate to pro class

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.070 
they're from intermediate to pro class
at<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.640> moment<00:03:37.260> there's<00:03:38.260> a<00:03:38.350> big<00:03:38.530> change<00:03:39.460> in

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
at the moment there's a big change in

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.420 
at the moment there's a big change in
knowledge<00:03:41.080> now<00:03:41.290> there's<00:03:41.830> all<00:03:41.950> of<00:03:41.980> drivers

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
knowledge now there's all of drivers

moment<00:03:58.060> I<00:03:58.090> was<00:03:58.180> just<00:03:58.360> trying<00:03:58.570> to<00:03:58.630> get<00:03:59.320> the

00:03:59.430 --> 00:03:59.440 
moment I was just trying to get the

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.530 
moment I was just trying to get the
perfecting<00:04:00.010> the<00:04:00.100> driving<00:04:00.490> and<00:04:00.700> getting

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
perfecting the driving and getting

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:04.800 
perfecting the driving and getting
things<00:04:01.750> more<00:04:02.050> in<00:04:02.260> tune<00:04:03.000> for<00:04:04.000> outsiders<00:04:04.480> like

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
things more in tune for outsiders like

things more in tune for outsiders like
myself<00:04:05.050> you<00:04:05.350> know<00:04:05.380> we<00:04:05.560> think<00:04:05.800> in<00:04:05.920> the<00:04:05.980> Middle

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
myself you know we think in the Middle

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.000 
myself you know we think in the Middle
East<00:04:06.340> Kuwait<00:04:06.700> we<00:04:06.850> think<00:04:07.090> dry<00:04:07.530> desert<00:04:08.530> sand

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
and the surfaces and things like that

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:14.730 
and the surfaces and things like that
you<00:04:12.910> guys<00:04:13.090> run<00:04:13.360> on<00:04:13.480> on<00:04:13.660> at<00:04:14.020> your<00:04:14.230> local<00:04:14.410> track

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:14.740 
you guys run on on at your local track

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.580 
you guys run on on at your local track
well<00:04:15.280> we<00:04:15.880> use<00:04:16.030> agricultural<00:04:16.660> soil<00:04:16.930> what<00:04:17.320> we<00:04:17.440> do

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
well we use agricultural soil what we do

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.560 
well we use agricultural soil what we do
is<00:04:17.859> we<00:04:18.340> have<00:04:18.489> normal<00:04:18.760> soil<00:04:18.910> and<00:04:19.180> then<00:04:19.269> what<00:04:19.450> we

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
is we have normal soil and then what we

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.240 
is we have normal soil and then what we
do<00:04:19.720> is<00:04:19.750> we<00:04:20.019> lay<00:04:20.140> down<00:04:20.320> the<00:04:20.500> agricultural<00:04:21.040> soil

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
do is we lay down the agricultural soil

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.160 
do is we lay down the agricultural soil
and<00:04:21.459> we<00:04:21.790> compact<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.300> down<00:04:22.480> it's<00:04:22.690> just<00:04:22.720> watered

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
and we compact it down it's just watered

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.860 
and we compact it down it's just watered
and<00:04:23.320> then<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.310> final<00:04:24.430> coating<00:04:24.790> we<00:04:25.060> we<00:04:25.630> spray

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
and then the final coating we we spray

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.290 
and then the final coating we we spray
it<00:04:25.930> down<00:04:26.050> with<00:04:26.110> a<00:04:26.290> sugar<00:04:26.680> water<00:04:26.919> and<00:04:27.190> we<00:04:28.150> use

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
it down with a sugar water and we use

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.630 
it down with a sugar water and we use
some<00:04:28.600> sort<00:04:28.750> of<00:04:28.840> bonding<00:04:29.770> agent<00:04:30.130> which<00:04:30.490> is

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
some sort of bonding agent which is

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.909 
some sort of bonding agent which is
called<00:04:30.930> jitter<00:04:31.930> bond<00:04:32.140> that's<00:04:32.710> the<00:04:32.800> more

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
called jitter bond that's the more

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:35.130 
called jitter bond that's the more
international<00:04:33.460> term<00:04:33.669> what<00:04:34.419> it<00:04:34.540> does<00:04:34.690> it<00:04:34.900> head

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
international term what it does it head

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.630 
international term what it does it head
here<00:04:35.350> is<00:04:35.500> this<00:04:35.620> they're<00:04:35.950> fine<00:04:36.190> soil<00:04:36.430> together

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
here is this they're fine soil together

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.720 
here is this they're fine soil together
so<00:04:36.940> you<00:04:37.030> don't<00:04:37.060> get<00:04:37.300> any<00:04:37.450> dust<00:04:37.570> particles<00:04:38.730> the

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:39.730 
so you don't get any dust particles the

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.370 
so you don't get any dust particles the
where<00:04:39.940> is<00:04:40.180> a<00:04:40.210> bit<00:04:40.510> less<00:04:40.720> than<00:04:40.750> Thailand

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
where is a bit less than Thailand

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.820 
where is a bit less than Thailand
because<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:43.000> meaner<00:04:43.900> soft<00:04:44.230> pair<00:04:44.530> of<00:04:44.650> tires

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
because the meaner soft pair of tires

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.250 
because the meaner soft pair of tires
that<00:04:45.010> say<00:04:45.250> AKA<00:04:45.580> socks<00:04:45.850> impact<00:04:46.600> will<00:04:46.810> last<00:04:47.020> you

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
that say AKA socks impact will last you

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.420 
that say AKA socks impact will last you
at<00:04:47.860> least<00:04:47.919> 20<00:04:48.370> minutes<00:04:48.490> without<00:04:49.030> any<00:04:49.330> problems

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
at least 20 minutes without any problems

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.010 
at least 20 minutes without any problems
and<00:04:51.430> track<00:04:51.730> lost<00:04:52.150> quite<00:04:52.419> long<00:04:52.630> we<00:04:52.810> don't<00:04:52.930> have

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
and track lost quite long we don't have

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.330 
and track lost quite long we don't have
to<00:04:53.080> do<00:04:53.200> it<00:04:53.290> is<00:04:53.380> not<00:04:53.530> very<00:04:53.560> high<00:04:53.860> maintenance

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
to do it is not very high maintenance

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.220 
to do it is not very high maintenance
but<00:04:54.400> it's<00:04:54.700> taking<00:04:54.910> us<00:04:55.000> more<00:04:55.750> than<00:04:55.900> seven<00:04:56.200> years

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
but it's taking us more than seven years

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.380 
but it's taking us more than seven years
to<00:04:56.500> forget<00:04:56.740> that<00:04:56.830> out<00:04:57.040> to<00:04:57.790> get<00:04:57.910> to<00:04:58.000> that<00:04:58.120> stage

00:04:58.380 --> 00:04:58.390 
to forget that out to get to that stage

00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:00.570 
to forget that out to get to that stage
now<00:04:58.630> good<00:04:59.440> thing<00:04:59.620> comes<00:04:59.860> with<00:05:00.040> time<00:05:00.190> all<00:05:00.430> right

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:00.580 
now good thing comes with time all right

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.090 
now good thing comes with time all right
yeah<00:05:01.020> even<00:05:02.020> on<00:05:02.110> hand<00:05:02.290> experience<00:05:02.770> from<00:05:02.980> other

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
yeah even on hand experience from other

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.920 
yeah even on hand experience from other
tracks<00:05:03.400> we<00:05:03.910> learned<00:05:04.090> from<00:05:04.120> Charlie<00:05:04.600> how<00:05:04.870> he

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:04.930 
tracks we learned from Charlie how he

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:07.140 
tracks we learned from Charlie how he
designed<00:05:05.560> is<00:05:05.680> in<00:05:05.800> his<00:05:06.070> tracks<00:05:06.340> we<00:05:06.910> learned

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
designed is in his tracks we learned

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:11.130 
designed is in his tracks we learned
from<00:05:07.180> Malaysia<00:05:08.400> how<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:09.600> how<00:05:10.600> to<00:05:10.630> create<00:05:10.990> the

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.140 
from Malaysia how to how to create the

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:13.800 
from Malaysia how to how to create the
jumps<00:05:11.410> even<00:05:11.680> to<00:05:11.770> minimize<00:05:12.160> the<00:05:12.570> impact<00:05:13.570> of<00:05:13.690> the

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
jumps even to minimize the impact of the

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:15.180
