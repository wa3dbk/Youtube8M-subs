00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.450
 but 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.950
 Good day, that was me 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:29.670
 purchased here is such a set 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:34.610
 consisting of nine taps and 9 dies 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:37.800
 plus ram holder and tap holder 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:41.160
 It was bought purely for the experiment I 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.980
 why because the price of this one 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.920
 this whole set costs 4 and a half 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:51.330
 dollar so how would we be with you 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.699
 We will definitely test these 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:57.330
 taps and dies worth buying by 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.850
 such a price taps and dies in general 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.449
 such a box 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:06.420
 here here is how you can 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.090
 hang on the wall and how it will be 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.640
 look like i get them perfectly 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.840
 I do not understand that on such an upper cap 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:22.410
 advancing what to get do not know 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:26.480
 what means what sizes of dies and 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:33.420
 taps there in this typesetters 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:35.920
 please who will be interested in check 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:40.619
 they will intensify as 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.619
 sounds like 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.910
 nothing is visible on 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.340
 let's on this side maybe here 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.340
 will be better 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:33.330
 just dice the rays they are the same 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.330
 probably too 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:46.220
 In general, here is such a set 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.220
 bought so visually of course 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.860
 rake holder in all likelihood 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.860
 probably all the same 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:58.020
 metal 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:01.020
 because he somehow you are covered in this color 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:04.940
 silver generally honest first 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:12.050
 impression of everything is suspicious so here 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:17.750
 ram holder for taps 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:22.560
 the holder though the test will show everything 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:28.730
 see for yourself taps and dies like 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.730
 as nothing all marked 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.300
 so here 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.110
 so evil tenacious 

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:45.300
 all in oil 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:50.610
 no checks all in oil 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:56.810
 cups too in oil 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:04:02.450
 sort of like metal in general 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:04.890
 set do a test 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.480
 make conclusions specific is it worth 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:14.209
 buy such 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:18.299
 no gifts and kits here is such a naborchik 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.019
 waiting for the test everyone thank you all good luck 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:21.019
 I'll see you
