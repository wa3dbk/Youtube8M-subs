00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
chewed on it when he was a little baby

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.520 
chewed on it when he was a little baby
which<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.690> kind<00:02:48.930> of<00:02:49.019> funny<00:02:50.480> but<00:02:51.480> I<00:02:51.690> do<00:02:51.750> have<00:02:52.230> all

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
which is kind of funny but I do have all

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.259 
which is kind of funny but I do have all
different<00:02:52.829> kinds<00:02:53.459> of<00:02:53.579> little<00:02:53.820> Scotch<00:02:54.000> shops

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
different kinds of little Scotch shops

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:56.420 
different kinds of little Scotch shops
and<00:02:54.540> I<00:02:54.900> have<00:02:55.170> just<00:02:55.709> a<00:02:55.890> couple<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.280> their

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
and I have just a couple of their

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.630 
and I have just a couple of their
structures<00:02:57.560> partly<00:02:58.560> because<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.920> don't<00:02:59.430> I

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
structures partly because I don't I

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.460 
structures partly because I don't I
don't<00:02:59.760> really<00:03:00.090> collect<00:03:00.360> structures<00:03:00.840> partly

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
don't really collect structures partly

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.600 
don't really collect structures partly
because<00:03:01.620> they<00:03:02.250> take<00:03:02.459> up<00:03:02.489> a<00:03:02.760> lot<00:03:03.060> of<00:03:03.269> room<00:03:04.610> well

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
because they take up a lot of room well

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.340 
because they take up a lot of room well
that's<00:03:05.790> pretty<00:03:06.150> much<00:03:06.299> it<00:03:06.600> for<00:03:06.630> my<00:03:06.959> LPS

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.940 
that's pretty much it for my LPS
