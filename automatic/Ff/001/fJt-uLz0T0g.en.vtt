00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.150
 Yes 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.410
 how 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.750
 grab the tub and write it in 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:26.380
 Place 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:28.570
 let the protective film still sit put it 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:31.050
 spirit level using debate leveling feet 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.050
 at the bottom of 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:44.320
 mount the over on mount the siphon and 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.560
 cut up the drain pipe of the overflow 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.560
 measure 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.070
 assemble the drain by first one 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.070
 to insert rubber gasket 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:19.070
 work your best with 2 people that's a lot 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:20.810
 easier because in a drain pipe on the 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.030
 trap and don't forget rubber 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.100
 use sealing ring 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.940
 close this drain pipe to the drain of 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.940
 your bathroom 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:36.320
 slide the bath into place and place 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.320
 it wonder how you stop 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.770
 mark the edges of the path on the 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.200
 wall we go one in this example 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.310
 build formwork from green gyproc or 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.260
 plasterboard 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:50.820
 measures the length and width of that and 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.990
 saw two beams to support 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.640
 the bath edge 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.530
 in this video we take into account the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.970
 width of the beam so that we are in gyproc 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.970
 and may make side 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.500
 fix the suspension splints to hours 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:06.500
 make sure they are level 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.450
 slide the bath over these beams 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.640
 our gyproc wall and we have a wooden frame 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.209
 We made it to the on times bars 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.209
 confirm 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.910
 cut and gripper plate for the 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:37.910
 side 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.240
 in this record we also make a square 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.070
 had an inspection of 28 by 28 centimeters 

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.720
 brooding inspection goes and cuts 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.550
 neat out 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.200
 make sure it definitely doesn't come before 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.450
 to sit on the frame 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.220
 turn the gripper plate 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.010
 we have narrow ones for this example 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.720
 relationships created on the side 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.610
 de proceed in the same way for the 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.320
 reverse this with the edges 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.320
 silicone and you're done
