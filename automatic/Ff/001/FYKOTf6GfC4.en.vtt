00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
so drop your fanny pack put on some

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.950 
so drop your fanny pack put on some
pants<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.890> let's<00:00:50.070> talk<00:00:50.340> about<00:00:50.550> training<00:00:51.420> I'm

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
pants and let's talk about training I'm

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.350 
pants and let's talk about training I'm
giving<00:00:52.440> you<00:00:52.559> four<00:00:53.160> concrete<00:00:53.610> examples

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
giving you four concrete examples

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.840 
giving you four concrete examples
there's<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> lot<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.840> permutations<00:00:55.680> but<00:00:56.430> when

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
there's a lot of permutations but when

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.250 
there's a lot of permutations but when
it<00:00:56.969> comes<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.270> training<00:00:57.690> there's<00:00:57.930> four

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
it comes to training there's four

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.049 
it comes to training there's four
different<00:00:58.289> variables<00:00:59.010> essentially<00:00:59.730> right

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
different variables essentially right

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.840 
different variables essentially right
besides<00:01:00.600> changing<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.410> exercise<00:01:02.010> what<00:01:02.670> can

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
besides changing the exercise what can

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.429 
besides changing the exercise what can
you<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.120> with<00:01:03.359> what<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.660> got<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.110> if<00:01:04.170> you<00:01:04.260> still

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
you do with what you got so if you still

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:05.929 
you do with what you got so if you still
want<00:01:04.589> to<00:01:04.650> bench<00:01:04.830> press<00:01:05.070> squat<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.549> deadlift

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
want to bench press squat and deadlift

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.420 
want to bench press squat and deadlift
how<00:01:06.240> can<00:01:06.479> you<00:01:06.570> manipulate<00:01:06.900> these<00:01:07.799> variables

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
how can you manipulate these variables

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.679 
how can you manipulate these variables
to<00:01:08.520> get<00:01:08.729> different<00:01:09.119> results

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
to get different results

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.000 
to get different results
it's<00:01:09.930> quite<00:01:10.140> simple<00:01:10.380> let's<00:01:10.650> talk<00:01:10.830> first

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
it's quite simple let's talk first

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.850 
it's quite simple let's talk first
intensity<00:01:11.790> intensity<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.439> weight<00:01:13.680> you

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
intensity intensity is the weight you

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.969 
intensity intensity is the weight you
lift<00:01:14.070> a<00:01:14.220> percentage<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.030> your<00:01:15.090> one<00:01:15.509> rep<00:01:15.930> max<00:01:16.140> so

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
lift a percentage of your one rep max so

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.679 
lift a percentage of your one rep max so
let's<00:01:17.189> say<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.400> benchpress<00:01:17.850> 100<00:01:18.390> pounds

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
let's say you benchpress 100 pounds

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.830 
let's say you benchpress 100 pounds
that's<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.960> one<00:01:19.200> rep<00:01:19.470> max<00:01:19.710> if<00:01:20.159> I<00:01:20.700> said<00:01:20.939> 80%<00:01:21.750> of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
that's a one rep max if I said 80% of

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.749 
that's a one rep max if I said 80% of
your<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.140> rep<00:01:22.320> max<00:01:22.350> that'd<00:01:22.740> be<00:01:22.890> 80<00:01:23.159> pounds

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
your one rep max that'd be 80 pounds

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.170 
your one rep max that'd be 80 pounds
that's<00:01:23.909> intensity<00:01:25.070> focus<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.310> intensity<00:01:27.030> if

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
that's intensity focus on intensity if

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.390 
that's intensity focus on intensity if
you<00:01:27.479> wanna<00:01:27.720> increase<00:01:28.020> strength<00:01:28.439> then<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.250> got

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
you wanna increase strength then we got

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.340 
you wanna increase strength then we got
talking<00:01:29.640> about<00:01:29.909> frequency<00:01:30.150> how<00:01:30.810> many<00:01:31.020> times

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
talking about frequency how many times

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.590 
talking about frequency how many times
you<00:01:31.530> train<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> week<00:01:32.040> both<00:01:32.549> a<00:01:32.909> particular

volume<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.970> the<00:01:48.149> total<00:01:48.479> amount<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.750> work<00:01:48.960> you

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
volume is the total amount of work you

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.289 
volume is the total amount of work you
do<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.740> that<00:01:50.250> workout<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:50.759> the<00:01:50.880> total<00:01:51.149> amount

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
do in that workout so the total amount

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.289 
do in that workout so the total amount
of<00:01:51.390> reps<00:01:51.630> and<00:01:51.869> sets<00:01:52.170> if<00:01:52.409> you<00:01:52.560> do<00:01:52.740> 3<00:01:53.520> sets<00:01:53.880> 3<00:01:54.000> by

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
of reps and sets if you do 3 sets 3 by

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.149 
of reps and sets if you do 3 sets 3 by
10<00:01:54.509> you're<00:01:54.780> doing<00:01:55.079> 3<00:01:55.320> sets<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.710> 10<00:01:55.920> repetitions

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
10 you're doing 3 sets of 10 repetitions

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.370 
10 you're doing 3 sets of 10 repetitions
you're<00:01:56.670> doing<00:01:56.909> 30<00:01:57.329> reps<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.810> whatever<00:01:57.990> weight

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
you're doing 30 reps of whatever weight

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.620 
you're doing 30 reps of whatever weight
you're<00:01:58.560> lifting<00:01:58.729> volume<00:01:59.729> if<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.240> want<00:02:00.479> to

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you're lifting volume if you want to

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.780 
you're lifting volume if you want to
increase<00:02:01.110> volume<00:02:01.380> slowly<00:02:01.799> over<00:02:02.130> time<00:02:02.340> that's

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
increase volume slowly over time that's

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.080 
increase volume slowly over time that's
more<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.719> general<00:02:04.259> for<00:02:04.530> size<00:02:04.850> lastly<00:02:05.850> we're

I do believe more on instinctive

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.130 
I do believe more on instinctive
training<00:02:15.610> but<00:02:16.060> for<00:02:16.270> certain<00:02:16.420> scenarios<00:02:16.990> if

a fat loss circuit timing arrest can be

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.200 
a fat loss circuit timing arrest can be
very<00:02:20.320> important<00:02:20.800> but<00:02:21.160> as<00:02:21.310> a<00:02:21.340> good<00:02:21.700> general

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
very important but as a good general

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.730 
very important but as a good general
rule<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.510> good<00:02:22.720> estimate<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.410> should<00:02:23.590> know

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
rule is a good estimate you should know

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.710 
rule is a good estimate you should know
roughly<00:02:24.190> how<00:02:24.280> long<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.940> rest<00:02:25.240> and<00:02:25.450> by

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
roughly how long you rest and by

roughly how long you rest and by
changing<00:02:26.410> this<00:02:26.530> it<00:02:26.740> can<00:02:26.950> change<00:02:27.250> the<00:02:27.610> total

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
changing this it can change the total

combine all those variables and then you

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.690 
combine all those variables and then you
get<00:02:43.660> your<00:02:43.810> training<00:02:44.290> program<00:02:44.710> and<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.010> smart

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:45.700 
get your training program and the smart

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.150 
get your training program and the smart
training<00:02:46.090> program<00:02:46.690> will<00:02:47.290> manipulate<00:02:47.710> these

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
training program will manipulate these

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.770 
training program will manipulate these
variables<00:02:48.640> by<00:02:48.760> changing<00:02:49.270> them<00:02:49.390> so<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:49.630> won't

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
variables by changing them so you won't

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.590 
variables by changing them so you won't
just<00:02:49.930> do<00:02:50.080> 3<00:02:50.350> by<00:02:50.500> 10<00:02:50.800> every<00:02:51.520> single<00:02:51.970> week<00:02:52.180> for<00:02:52.420> a

program<00:02:55.660> then<00:02:55.870> how<00:02:56.050> do<00:02:56.110> you<00:02:56.320> know<00:02:56.740> what<00:02:57.130> to

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:57.250 
program then how do you know what to

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.530 
program then how do you know what to
change<00:02:57.520> and<00:02:57.730> when<00:02:57.850> to<00:02:58.000> change<00:02:58.180> well<00:02:58.450> it's

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
change and when to change well it's

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.450 
change and when to change well it's
quite<00:02:58.720> simple<00:02:59.140> one<00:02:59.620> when<00:02:59.860> you<00:02:59.980> notice<00:03:00.220> that

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
quite simple one when you notice that

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.130 
quite simple one when you notice that
your<00:03:00.670> body's<00:03:00.970> stagnating<00:03:01.690> I<00:03:01.780> think<00:03:01.990> it's

these variables and depending upon your

these variables and depending upon your
goal<00:03:27.550> will<00:03:28.120> dictate<00:03:28.840> which<00:03:29.350> variables<00:03:30.220> you

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:30.370 
goal will dictate which variables you
