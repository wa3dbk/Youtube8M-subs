00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
sides of the base here um i would

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.200 
sides of the base here um i would
suggest<00:00:30.869> one<00:00:31.260> thing<00:00:31.470> trying<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.340> clear<00:00:32.820> a

your<00:02:07.409> defenses<00:02:07.890> are<00:02:08.009> pretty<00:02:08.280> well<00:02:08.340> spread<00:02:08.729> out

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
your defenses are pretty well spread out

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:10.190 
your defenses are pretty well spread out
I<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.330> I<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.509> how<00:02:09.780> all<00:02:09.810> your

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
I like that I like how all your

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.470 
I like that I like how all your
buildings<00:02:10.800> are<00:02:11.039> pretty<00:02:11.670> close<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.090> the<00:02:12.180> center

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
buildings are pretty close to the center

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.200 
buildings are pretty close to the center
it<00:02:12.599> looks<00:02:12.750> like<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:12.989> do

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.210 
it looks like you do

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:15.900 
it looks like you do
some<00:02:13.330> walls<00:02:13.570> on<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:13.840> outside<00:02:14.730> what<00:02:15.730> I<00:02:15.760> would

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
some walls on the outside what I would

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.270 
some walls on the outside what I would
really<00:02:16.060> suggest<00:02:16.840> is<00:02:17.410> putting<00:02:17.920> some<00:02:18.160> more

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
really suggest is putting some more

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.400 
really suggest is putting some more
compartments<00:02:18.910> on<00:02:19.030> the<00:02:19.180> bottom<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.810> top<00:02:20.020> sides

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
compartments on the bottom and top sides

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.110 
compartments on the bottom and top sides
just<00:02:21.100> split<00:02:21.370> a<00:02:21.400> couple<00:02:21.670> of<00:02:21.730> those<00:02:21.820> buildings

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
just split a couple of those buildings

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.610 
just split a couple of those buildings
up<00:02:22.420> there<00:02:22.570> put<00:02:22.780> some<00:02:22.900> more<00:02:22.990> compartments<00:02:23.530> and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
up there put some more compartments and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.620 
up there put some more compartments and
they<00:02:23.680> don't<00:02:23.830> make<00:02:23.890> it<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.100> lot<00:02:24.280> harder<00:02:24.310> for<00:02:24.640> the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
they don't make it a lot harder for the

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.600 
they don't make it a lot harder for the
other<00:02:25.840> units<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.560> just<00:02:26.950> go<00:02:27.130> around<00:02:27.250> your<00:02:27.490> base

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
other units to just go around your base

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.090 
other units to just go around your base
and<00:02:27.850> just<00:02:28.000> take<00:02:28.210> everything<00:02:28.390> they<00:02:28.720> want<00:02:28.960> to<00:02:29.140> so

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
and just take everything they want to so

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.590 
and just take everything they want to so
definitely<00:02:30.460> put<00:02:30.760> more<00:02:30.970> compartments<00:02:31.480> and

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
definitely put more compartments and

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.820 
definitely put more compartments and
spread<00:02:31.810> out<00:02:31.930> your<00:02:32.020> storage<00:02:32.320> is<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.500> tad<00:02:32.800> more

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
spread out your storage is a tad more

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.670 
spread out your storage is a tad more
but<00:02:33.340> it<00:02:34.330> looks<00:02:34.540> like<00:02:34.720> I<00:02:34.870> your<00:02:35.050> defenses<00:02:35.560> are

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
but it looks like I your defenses are

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.200 
but it looks like I your defenses are
getting<00:02:35.860> maxed<00:02:36.190> and<00:02:36.250> everything<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:36.760> I

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
getting maxed and everything and I

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.820 
getting maxed and everything and I
really<00:02:37.450> like<00:02:37.630> where<00:02:38.320> it's<00:02:38.470> going<00:02:38.680> with<00:02:38.800> that

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
really like where it's going with that

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.430 
really like where it's going with that
so<00:02:39.820> definitely<00:02:39.970> keep<00:02:40.480> up<00:02:40.720> that<00:02:40.750> good<00:02:40.990> work

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440

worried<00:03:12.870> your<00:03:13.870> buildings<00:03:14.230> are<00:03:14.320> pretty<00:03:14.650> close

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890 
worried your buildings are pretty close

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.980 
worried your buildings are pretty close
to<00:03:15.040> the<00:03:15.130> center<00:03:15.430> as<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:15.910> can<00:03:16.270> see<00:03:16.570> right<00:03:16.780> there<00:03:16.960> I

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
to the center as I can see right there I

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.310 
to the center as I can see right there I
like<00:03:17.230> that<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:18.150> think<00:03:19.150> you're<00:03:19.330> maxed<00:03:19.840> except

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
like that I think you're maxed except

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.000 
like that I think you're maxed except
for<00:03:20.560> your<00:03:20.910> two<00:03:21.910> essence<00:03:22.860> collectors<00:03:23.860> that

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.010 
for your two essence collectors that

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:26.640 
for your two essence collectors that
you're<00:03:24.160> upgrading<00:03:24.310> possibly<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.300> maybe<00:03:26.020> one

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
you're upgrading possibly and maybe one

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.980 
you're upgrading possibly and maybe one
other<00:03:26.680> market<00:03:27.310> but<00:03:27.490> I<00:03:27.850> honestly<00:03:28.630> think<00:03:28.870> that

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:28.990 
other market but I honestly think that

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:30.510 
other market but I honestly think that
you're<00:03:29.170> maxed<00:03:29.650> I<00:03:29.740> think<00:03:29.890> your<00:03:30.010> walls<00:03:30.220> might

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:30.520 
you're maxed I think your walls might

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.210 
you're maxed I think your walls might
even<00:03:30.670> be<00:03:30.820> maxed<00:03:31.180> right<00:03:31.330> now<00:03:31.480> so<00:03:32.470> it<00:03:32.800> looks<00:03:33.130> like

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
even be maxed right now so it looks like

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.770 
even be maxed right now so it looks like
you're<00:03:33.370> pretty<00:03:33.910> much<00:03:34.030> ready<00:03:34.150> to<00:03:34.450> move<00:03:34.630> up

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
you're pretty much ready to move up

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.390 
you're pretty much ready to move up
whenever<00:03:35.020> you<00:03:35.710> get<00:03:35.800> those<00:03:35.920> little<00:03:36.190> cool
