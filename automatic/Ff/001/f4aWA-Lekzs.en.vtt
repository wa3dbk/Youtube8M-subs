00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.450
 hi friends with you xenia fireplace 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.940
 Danish project herd foto.ru 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.560
 I present to you a new lesson about how 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.920
 take a picture and freeze the spray 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.390
 if you don't have flash at hand if 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.640
 you like this video and you want 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.529

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.860
 today we will take off the liquid 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.690
 movement we take a glass and we will 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:37.030
 gradually pour back a stream of water and 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:40.210
 try to freeze the moment when 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.820
 splashes fly out of the glass let's me 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.320
 show you what i mean it 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.000
 video of what we have to 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.640
 turn out only in slow motion 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.890
 a jet of liquid hits the glass fills 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.920
 him and scatter splashes which we 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.420
 try to freeze let's see 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.930
 what we need in order to 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.220
 repeat such a frame 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.900
 transparent wine glass using sticky 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.550
 the tape is attached to the holder with 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.770
 platform which is installed under 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.530
 tilt the camera mounted tripod 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.150
 in front of a glass of wine glasses of between 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.640
 light source is tight 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.350
 translucent tracing paper as a source 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.260
 lighting is used ordinary 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:21.659
 100 watt halogen lamp 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:24.430
 secured with a clothes peg holder 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.229
 go to the camera settings before 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.659
 just and fix the focus point on 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.420
 center of the glass and switching to mode 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.240
 manual focusing also rented in 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.899
 manual mode with shutter speed settings 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:40.299
 one hundredth of a second aperture 50 iso 100 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:42.189
 i also switch to serial mode 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:44.320
 shooting to have turned 

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.200
 as many frames as possible with frozen 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.759
 spray next to me is the usual 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.399
 bucket of water to scoop 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.399
 water i use a regular measuring cup and 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.150
 so let's try 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.980
 the moment we pour water we 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.720
 hold down the shutter button and do a lot 

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.040
 many frames 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.140
 let's see what we did with such 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.550
 settings 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:14.850
 not bad for a start but I would do 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:16.680
 I want to get some changes 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.740
 tougher cut-off pattern and 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.959
 darken my frame so I shorten 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.680
 shutter speed up to 1 200 seconds and 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:27.270
 closing the diaphragm would be a value of 6 and 3 and 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.989
 again pour water and hold the button 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:34.290
 descent let's see what happened 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.120
 this time this frame looks better by 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.100
 exposure even the water jet looks 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:44.010
 better let's try some more 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:45.870
 tricks i want to really freeze 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.790
 spray so i expose the shutter speed alone 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.610
 thousandths of a second and compensating for this 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.890
 by raising from hell a value of 400 while 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.560
 aperture and will close the value of 7 in order 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:00.560
 to increase the depth of field in the frame 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:03.239
 and so we scoop some water and 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.730
 We start to pour it in a glass and we clamp 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.160
 the shutter release button see what happened 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.440
 this time about it looks much better 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.519
 one thousandth of a second truly 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:16.049
 helps freeze the liquid think we 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.660
 finally got the right settings 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.220
 exposure to start shooting 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.380
 and until we get 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.250
 the desired frame 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.650
 last thing i want to do 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.260
 it's a little touch up the water usual 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.900
 blue food dye just 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.760
 dripping a few drops ok bucket for 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.970
 in order to give it a beautiful blue 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.970
 shade 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.260
 scoop up some tinted water and 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.260
 start shooting 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:47.620
 it should look cool let's 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:49.390
 look I really like the final 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:52.450
 the result and and here is this blue tint 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.280
 the waters here came in very handy let's 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.920
 see slow motion that we 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.660
 did while the water pours into the glass 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:00.790
 the camera takes several shots 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:07.989
 successively freezing separate stages 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:11.940
 water movement at the end of the survey, view 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:11.940
 the whole series choose the best frame 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.470
 In my opinion this is the most successful frame with 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.750
 my shooting today is cool 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.720
 underlined the movement of water and caught the most 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.820
 lucky moment you will be surprised how much 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.180
 different interesting frames you can get 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:45.770
 I rented a spray of water necessary 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.020
 try this at home if you 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.390
