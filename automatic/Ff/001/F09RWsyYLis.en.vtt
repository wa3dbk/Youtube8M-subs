00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.700 

I<00:00:00.030> feel<00:00:00.329> a<00:00:00.719> lot<00:00:01.530> better<00:00:01.860> before<00:00:06.560> I'm<00:00:07.560> just

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
I feel a lot better before I'm just

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.830 
I feel a lot better before I'm just
during<00:00:08.189> a<00:00:08.280> low-light<00:00:08.670> purchase<00:00:09.210> fish<00:00:09.450> tend<00:00:09.750> to

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:09.840 
during a low-light purchase fish tend to

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.990 
during a low-light purchase fish tend to
roam<00:00:10.080> a<00:00:10.110> lot<00:00:10.469> more<00:00:10.679> the<00:00:10.920> strike<00:00:11.250> zone<00:00:11.280> opens<00:00:11.849> up

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
roam a lot more the strike zone opens up

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.180 
roam a lot more the strike zone opens up
instead<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.420> being<00:00:12.660> you<00:00:13.259> know<00:00:13.290> foot<00:00:13.710> or<00:00:13.830> two<00:00:14.009> it

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
instead of being you know foot or two it

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
instead of being you know foot or two it
ends<00:00:14.580> up<00:00:14.670> being<00:00:14.820> like<00:00:15.030> five<00:00:15.299> or<00:00:15.450> six<00:00:15.480> foot<00:00:20.210> so

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
ends up being like five or six foot so

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.090 
ends up being like five or six foot so
even<00:00:21.420> though<00:00:21.510> I'm<00:00:21.810> fishing<00:00:22.410> this<00:00:22.680> rip<00:00:22.920> made

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
even though I'm fishing this rip made

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.810 
even though I'm fishing this rip made
along<00:00:23.310> pretty<00:00:23.640> quick<00:00:24.650> but<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.800> between<00:00:26.070> I'll

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
along pretty quick but in between I'll

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.490 
along pretty quick but in between I'll
rip<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.330> out<00:00:27.570> there<00:00:27.779> pretty<00:00:27.930> quick<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.439> then

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
rip it out there pretty quick and then

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.640 
rip it out there pretty quick and then
the<00:00:28.740> in-between<00:00:29.689> pause<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.990> I<00:00:31.080> let<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.349> sit<00:00:31.619> a

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
the in-between pause is I let it sit a

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.260 
the in-between pause is I let it sit a
little<00:00:31.980> while<00:00:32.130> so<00:00:32.460> even<00:00:32.850> though<00:00:32.940> I'm<00:00:33.000> ripping

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
little while so even though I'm ripping

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:34.790 
little while so even though I'm ripping
it<00:00:33.329> pretty<00:00:33.570> fast<00:00:33.780> I'm<00:00:34.020> letting<00:00:34.230> it<00:00:34.320> sit<00:00:34.620> long

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it pretty fast I'm letting it sit long

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.010 
it pretty fast I'm letting it sit long
enough<00:00:34.829> I<00:00:35.280> feel<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.420> fish<00:00:36.600> have<00:00:36.809> enough

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
enough I feel that the fish have enough

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.139 
enough I feel that the fish have enough
time<00:00:37.260> to<00:00:37.410> come<00:00:37.559> up<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.770> get<00:00:37.950> it<00:00:40.879> we'll<00:00:41.879> see<00:00:42.059> how

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
time to come up and get it we'll see how

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.369 
time to come up and get it we'll see how
that<00:00:42.210> pans<00:00:42.719> out<00:00:44.450> where<00:00:45.450> we're<00:00:46.020> fishing<00:00:46.320> a

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
that pans out where we're fishing a

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.990 
that pans out where we're fishing a
little<00:00:46.590> bit<00:00:46.680> of<00:00:46.770> red<00:00:46.950> dirt<00:00:47.250> here<00:00:47.489> sometimes<00:00:47.850> on

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
chesty get on this red dirt pattern I'm

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.160 
chesty get on this red dirt pattern I'm
not<00:00:50.640> exactly<00:00:51.000> sure<00:00:51.180> whether<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> car<00:00:51.989> that's

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
not exactly sure whether the car that's

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.500 
not exactly sure whether the car that's
like<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.440> little<00:00:52.710> better<00:00:53.010> or<00:00:53.280> or<00:00:53.460> exactly<00:00:54.210> what

but there have been actually quite a few
times<00:00:57.570> when<00:00:57.870> I'll<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.620> catch<00:00:58.859> them<00:00:58.980> on<00:00:59.129> these

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
times when I'll just catch them on these

red dirt flat Bank okay you know like I

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.250 
red dirt flat Bank okay you know like I
said<00:01:05.909> today<00:01:06.180> we're<00:01:06.479> out<00:01:06.510> pre<00:01:06.869> fish<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.170> we're

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
said today we're out pre fish and we're

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.690 
said today we're out pre fish and we're
kind<00:01:07.439> of<00:01:07.470> out<00:01:07.619> trying<00:01:07.920> some<00:01:08.130> different<00:01:08.159> stuff

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
kind of out trying some different stuff

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.270 
kind of out trying some different stuff
out<00:01:08.939> experiment<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> little<00:01:09.659> bit<00:01:10.010> see<00:01:11.010> what<00:01:11.189> it

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
out experiment a little bit see what it

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.210 
out experiment a little bit see what it
takes<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.640> get<00:01:11.790> maybe<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.240> few<00:01:12.510> better<00:01:12.750> bites<00:01:13.220> we

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
takes to get maybe a few better bites we

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.020 
takes to get maybe a few better bites we
got<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.400> couple<00:01:14.610> good<00:01:14.850> bites<00:01:15.090> already<00:01:17.030> looking

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
got a couple good bites already looking

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.270 
got a couple good bites already looking
for<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.180> couple<00:01:18.330> more<00:01:18.570> trying<00:01:19.049> to<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:20.040> know<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
for a couple more trying to you know the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.740 
for a couple more trying to you know the
whole<00:01:20.430> idea<00:01:20.670> about<00:01:20.759> pre<00:01:21.150> fishing<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.540> just

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
whole idea about pre fishing is just

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.660 
whole idea about pre fishing is just
come<00:01:21.900> up<00:01:22.020> with<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> pattern<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:23.009> try<00:01:23.189> to<00:01:23.250> get<00:01:23.640> a

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
come up with a pattern and try to get a

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.120 
come up with a pattern and try to get a
pattern<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.229> where<00:01:25.229> these<00:01:25.439> fish<00:01:25.619> are<00:01:25.890> what

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
pattern of where these fish are what

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.620 
pattern of where these fish are what
they're<00:01:26.280> doing<00:01:26.640> you<00:01:26.939> know<00:01:27.060> we're<00:01:27.240> like<00:01:27.390> we're

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
they're doing you know we're like we're

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.810 
they're doing you know we're like we're
a<00:01:27.659> couple<00:01:27.930> weeks<00:01:28.110> out<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.710> we<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.549> figure<00:01:29.700> out

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
a couple weeks out so we can figure out

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.760 
a couple weeks out so we can figure out
where<00:01:30.000> they<00:01:30.119> are<00:01:30.270> now<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:30.780> hopefully<00:01:30.960> kind<00:01:31.680> of

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
where they are now and hopefully kind of

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.170 
where they are now and hopefully kind of
follow<00:01:32.009> them<00:01:32.280> through<00:01:32.549> the<00:01:32.579> next<00:01:32.880> couple

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
follow them through the next couple

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.609 
follow them through the next couple
weeks<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.479> see<00:01:33.689> where<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:34.079> go<00:01:34.110> where<00:01:34.500> they

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
weeks and see where they go where they

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.679 
weeks and see where they go where they
change<00:01:34.979> from<00:01:36.170> that<00:01:37.170> would<00:01:37.290> be<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.439> big<00:01:37.650> plus<00:01:38.689> so

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
change from that would be a big plus so

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.450 
change from that would be a big plus so
the<00:01:39.869> most<00:01:40.020> important<00:01:40.439> thing<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:41.040> get

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the most important thing is just to get

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.789 
the most important thing is just to get
a<00:01:41.520> pattern<00:01:41.820> together<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:43.350> know<00:01:43.500> when<00:01:43.680> you're

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
a pattern together you know when you're

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.780 
a pattern together you know when you're
out<00:01:43.920> when<00:01:44.070> you're<00:01:44.100> pre<00:01:44.340> fishing<00:01:44.640> for<00:01:44.700> a

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
out when you're pre fishing for a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.760 
out when you're pre fishing for a
tournament<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.210> don't<00:01:45.450> really<00:01:45.659> spots<00:01:46.380> or<00:01:46.619> not

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
tournament you don't really spots or not

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.620 
tournament you don't really spots or not
really<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.310> big<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.610> deal<00:01:47.880> you<00:01:48.270> know<00:01:48.420> you're

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
really that big a deal you know you're

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:49.850 
really that big a deal you know you're
gonna<00:01:48.720> have<00:01:48.930> your<00:01:49.110> little<00:01:49.229> spots<00:01:49.560> at<00:01:49.740> your

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
gonna have your little spots at your

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.460 
gonna have your little spots at your
favorite<00:01:50.310> but<00:01:50.520> I'll<00:01:51.299> try<00:01:51.659> not<00:01:51.689> to<00:01:51.869> rely<00:01:52.259> on<00:01:52.290> a

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
favorite but I'll try not to rely on a

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.800 
favorite but I'll try not to rely on a
spot<00:01:52.950> I'll<00:01:53.189> try<00:01:53.399> to<00:01:53.460> rely<00:01:53.790> much<00:01:54.000> more<00:01:54.270> on<00:01:54.420> a

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
spot I'll try to rely much more on a

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.389 
spot I'll try to rely much more on a
pattern<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.470> know<00:01:55.590> if<00:01:55.680> I'm<00:01:55.770> catching<00:01:56.070> on<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.189> KO

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
pattern you know if I'm catching on a KO

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.940 
pattern you know if I'm catching on a KO
over<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.759> point<00:01:57.030> or<00:01:57.390> you<00:01:57.990> know<00:01:58.110> windblown<00:01:58.560> point

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
over a point or you know windblown point

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.179 
over a point or you know windblown point
or<00:01:59.280> you<00:02:00.000> know<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> little<00:02:00.360> piece<00:02:00.479> of<00:02:00.630> structure

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
or you know a little piece of structure

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.620 
or you know a little piece of structure
what<00:02:02.189> kind<00:02:02.460> of<00:02:02.520> structure<00:02:02.939> that<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.270> and<00:02:03.540> then

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
what kind of structure that is and then

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.389 
what kind of structure that is and then
what<00:02:03.810> kind<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.049> bait<00:02:04.229> I'm<00:02:04.380> using<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.829> catch

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
what kind of bait I'm using to catch

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.279 
what kind of bait I'm using to catch
them<00:02:05.549> on<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.820> piece<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.180> structure<00:02:09.289> so

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
them on that piece of structure so

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.140 
them on that piece of structure so
pattern<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.830> much<00:02:11.009> more<00:02:11.250> important<00:02:11.730> than<00:02:11.879> a

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
pattern is much more important than a

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.240 
pattern is much more important than a
spot

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.470 

when<00:02:17.250> I'm<00:02:17.340> working<00:02:17.610> in<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:17.730> spook<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.180> like<00:02:18.360> to

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
when I'm working in a spook I like to

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.640 
when I'm working in a spook I like to
work<00:02:18.630> it<00:02:18.780> pretty<00:02:18.960> hard<00:02:19.110> especially<00:02:19.230> when<00:02:19.530> I'm

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
work it pretty hard especially when I'm

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:22.670 
work it pretty hard especially when I'm
covering<00:02:19.980> a<00:02:20.010> lot<00:02:20.160> of<00:02:20.190> water<00:02:20.460> I<00:02:21.440> like<00:02:22.440> it<00:02:22.620> to

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
covering a lot of water I like it to

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.700 
covering a lot of water I like it to
make<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.980> big<00:02:23.190> pop<00:02:23.460> splash<00:02:24.210> I<00:02:24.690> think<00:02:25.650> it

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:25.710 
make that big pop splash I think it

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.640 
make that big pop splash I think it
calls<00:02:25.950> you<00:02:26.070> fish<00:02:26.280> up<00:02:26.520> a<00:02:26.580> little<00:02:26.730> bit<00:02:26.880> better

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
calls you fish up a little bit better

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.200 
calls you fish up a little bit better
