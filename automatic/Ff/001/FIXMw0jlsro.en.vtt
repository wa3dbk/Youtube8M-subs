00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.130 
okay so let's get started

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.700 
okay so let's get started
okay<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.609> as<00:00:17.970> you<00:00:18.210> can<00:00:18.359> see<00:00:18.420> I'm<00:00:18.930> here<00:00:19.260> on<00:00:19.470> my

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
okay so as you can see I'm here on my

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.400 
okay so as you can see I'm here on my
Android<00:00:20.279> device<00:00:20.310> it's<00:00:20.970> running<00:00:21.330> 4.4<00:00:21.900> kitkat

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
Android device it's running 4.4 kitkat

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.859 
Android device it's running 4.4 kitkat
and<00:00:22.699> does<00:00:23.699> not<00:00:23.850> have<00:00:24.090> a<00:00:24.119> pattern<00:00:24.390> lock<00:00:24.630> right

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
and does not have a pattern lock right

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.310 
and does not have a pattern lock right
now<00:00:25.140> it's<00:00:25.769> just<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.730> slide<00:00:26.970> lock<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.900> I'm<00:00:28.170> just

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
now it's just a slide lock so I'm just

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.410 
now it's just a slide lock so I'm just
going<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.529> go<00:00:28.710> ahead<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.250> set<00:00:29.609> up<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:30.029> pattern

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
going to go ahead and set up a pattern

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.310 
going to go ahead and set up a pattern
lock<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.080> this<00:00:33.260> here<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.290> go<00:00:34.620> into<00:00:34.739> security<00:00:35.280> and

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
lock on this here I go into security and

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.729 
lock on this here I go into security and
pattern<00:00:37.430> let's<00:00:38.430> draw<00:00:38.790> random<00:00:39.360> one

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.490 

so<00:00:43.540> now<00:00:44.920> if<00:00:45.920> I<00:00:46.270> feed<00:00:47.270> in<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:47.570> correct<00:00:47.960> pattern

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
so now if I feed in the correct pattern

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.110 
so now if I feed in the correct pattern
the<00:00:49.070> device<00:00:49.660> unlocks<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.050> for<00:00:51.949> any<00:00:52.250> other<00:00:52.579> you

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
the device unlocks and for any other you

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.600 
the device unlocks and for any other you
know<00:00:53.440> pattern<00:00:54.440> it<00:00:55.219> does<00:00:55.579> not<00:00:55.820> take<00:00:56.600> in<00:00:56.809> the

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
know pattern it does not take in the

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.799 
know pattern it does not take in the
pattern<00:00:58.610> so<00:00:58.850> what<00:00:59.180> I'm<00:00:59.300> going<00:00:59.449> to<00:00:59.510> go<00:00:59.690> ahead

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
pattern so what I'm going to go ahead

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.830 
pattern so what I'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:00.140> do<00:01:00.379> here<00:01:00.739> is<00:01:01.750> I'll<00:01:02.750> just<00:01:03.140> make<00:01:03.829> a<00:01:04.840> number

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
and do here is I'll just make a number

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.670 
and do here is I'll just make a number
of<00:01:06.070> incorrect<00:01:07.070> attempts<00:01:07.700> so<00:01:07.850> that<00:01:08.030> Android

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
of incorrect attempts so that Android

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:24.510 
of incorrect attempts so that Android
locks<00:01:09.680> my<00:01:09.950> device

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.690 

okay<00:01:25.210> so<00:01:25.869> now<00:01:26.259> what<00:01:26.439> Android<00:01:26.920> has<00:01:27.159> done<00:01:27.460> is

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
okay so now what Android has done is

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.420 
okay so now what Android has done is
it's<00:01:27.970> a<00:01:28.210> it's<00:01:28.240> got<00:01:28.960> my<00:01:29.320> device<00:01:29.680> locked<00:01:30.159> down

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
it's a it's got my device locked down

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.639 
it's a it's got my device locked down
and<00:01:30.790> if<00:01:30.939> I<00:01:31.119> click<00:01:31.390> on<00:01:31.509> this<00:01:31.659> forgot<00:01:32.079> password
