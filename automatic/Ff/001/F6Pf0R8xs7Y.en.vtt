00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
topic of discussion for this video I

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.969 
topic of discussion for this video I
have<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.500> idea<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:29.329> once<00:01:30.329> you<00:01:30.810> buy<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.619> skin

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
have this idea that once you buy a skin

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.100 
have this idea that once you buy a skin
pack<00:01:32.250> whether<00:01:32.880> it's<00:01:33.150> from<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.509> PlayStation

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
pack whether it's from the PlayStation

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.270 
pack whether it's from the PlayStation
Vita<00:01:34.670> PlayStation<00:01:35.670> 3<00:01:35.909> or<00:01:36.090> Playstation<00:01:36.930> 4

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
Vita PlayStation 3 or Playstation 4

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.310 
Vita PlayStation 3 or Playstation 4
those<00:01:38.280> skins<00:01:38.729> should<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.390> able<00:01:39.509> to<00:01:39.750> transfer

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
those skins should be able to transfer

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.749 
those skins should be able to transfer
from<00:01:40.710> one<00:01:40.920> version<00:01:41.130> to<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.490> other

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
from one version to the other

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.170 
from one version to the other
um<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:43.320> PlayStation<00:01:44.280> Vita<00:01:44.490> is<00:01:44.700> really

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
um I know PlayStation Vita is really

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.330 
um I know PlayStation Vita is really
nice<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.780> it's<00:01:45.869> very<00:01:46.079> convenient<00:01:47.070> to

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
nice and it's very convenient to

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.760 
nice and it's very convenient to
transfer<00:01:47.759> your<00:01:47.850> like<00:01:48.000> your<00:01:48.119> game<00:01:48.390> saved<00:01:48.899> from

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
transfer your like your game saved from

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.800 
transfer your like your game saved from
council<00:01:50.700> council<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.890> I<00:01:52.890> think<00:01:53.610> that<00:01:53.850> maybe

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
council council and I think that maybe

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.660 
council council and I think that maybe
if<00:01:55.200> you<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.799> a<00:01:55.860> PlayStation<00:01:56.399> Network

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
if you have a PlayStation Network

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.789 
if you have a PlayStation Network
account<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.600> can<00:01:57.780> link<00:01:58.159> your<00:01:59.159> Mojang<00:01:59.790> account

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
account you can link your Mojang account

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.260 
account you can link your Mojang account
with<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:02.040> PlayStation<00:02:02.610> account<00:02:02.909> so

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
with that PlayStation account so

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.170 
with that PlayStation account so
wherever<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.649> go<00:02:04.950> you're<00:02:05.700> going<00:02:05.820> to<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:06.000> able

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
wherever you go you're going to be able

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.969 
wherever you go you're going to be able
to<00:02:06.509> use<00:02:06.869> your<00:02:07.350> skin

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
to use your skin

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.460 
to use your skin
and<00:02:08.220> maybe<00:02:08.759> access<00:02:09.390> your<00:02:09.569> worlds<00:02:10.020> or<00:02:10.110> whatnot

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
and maybe access your worlds or whatnot

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.600 
and maybe access your worlds or whatnot
that<00:02:10.739> way<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:12.530> reduces<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.860> amount<00:02:14.010> of<00:02:14.370> money

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
that way it reduces the amount of money

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.699 
that way it reduces the amount of money
you<00:02:14.819> spend<00:02:15.030> on<00:02:15.420> your<00:02:15.510> skin<00:02:16.019> packs<00:02:16.290> I<00:02:16.440> mean<00:02:16.560> how

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
you spend on your skin packs I mean how

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.979 
you spend on your skin packs I mean how
much<00:02:16.830> would<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.099> suck<00:02:17.519> if<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.690> plan<00:02:18.900> on

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
much would that suck if you plan on
