00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
now I have done this in the past because

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.050 
now I have done this in the past because
this<00:02:36.120> is<00:02:36.360> just<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.870> straight-up<00:02:37.140> conditioner

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060

I've done this in the past with other
conditioners<00:02:42.890> but<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:43.920> find<00:02:44.250> that<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.580> aussie

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360

when<00:03:33.780> I<00:03:33.810> was<00:03:33.960> using<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.350> 3<00:03:34.530> minute<00:03:34.770> miracle<00:03:34.890> if

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
when I was using the 3 minute miracle if

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.950 
when I was using the 3 minute miracle if
it<00:03:35.400> looked<00:03:35.640> like<00:03:35.820> I<00:03:35.940> didn't<00:03:36.240> use<00:03:36.360> a<00:03:36.390> lot<00:03:36.660> well

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:36.960 
it looked like I didn't use a lot well

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.760 
it looked like I didn't use a lot well
that<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.860> true<00:03:38.400> because<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.970> actually<00:03:39.570> ran<00:03:40.560> out

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:40.770 
that is true because I actually ran out

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.280 
that is true because I actually ran out
so<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.340> used<00:03:42.030> what<00:03:42.420> I<00:03:42.450> had<00:03:42.540> left<00:03:42.990> in<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:43.290 
so I used what I had left in the

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.370 
so I used what I had left in the
container<00:03:43.650> and<00:03:43.770> then<00:03:44.160> I<00:03:44.430> used<00:03:45.180> about<00:03:45.420> 2<00:03:45.840> or<00:03:45.870> 3<00:03:46.110> I

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
container and then I used about 2 or 3 I

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.820 
container and then I used about 2 or 3 I
guess<00:03:46.709> you<00:03:46.830> could<00:03:46.950> say<00:03:47.070> scoops<00:03:47.610> from<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.990> just

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:49.830 
guess you could say scoops from the just

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.910 
guess you could say scoops from the just
regular<00:03:50.280> old<00:03:50.310> suave<00:03:50.670> conditioner<00:03:51.860> but<00:03:52.860> the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
regular old suave conditioner but the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.250 
regular old suave conditioner but the
amount<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:54.000> conditioner<00:03:54.570> that<00:03:54.690> you<00:03:54.810> want<00:03:55.140> to

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
amount of conditioner that you want to

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.500 
amount of conditioner that you want to
use<00:03:55.410> is<00:03:55.740> typically<00:03:56.580> about<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.880> same<00:03:57.209> that<00:03:57.420> you

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
use is typically about the same that you

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.840 
use is typically about the same that you
do<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.990> would<00:03:58.110> use<00:03:58.320> for<00:03:58.560> a<00:03:58.770> regular<00:03:59.220> pomade<00:03:59.610> so

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
do you would use for a regular pomade so

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.580 
do you would use for a regular pomade so
2<00:04:00.360> to<00:04:00.510> 3<00:04:00.780> scoops<00:04:01.530> so<00:04:02.540> now<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:03.720> all<00:04:03.900> set<00:04:04.230> in<00:04:04.410> my

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
2 to 3 scoops so now it's all set in my

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.980 
2 to 3 scoops so now it's all set in my
