the<00:02:27.990> rest<00:02:28.200> of<00:02:28.350> it<00:02:28.500> and<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:28.920> holds<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.370> there<00:02:29.720> now

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
the rest of it and it holds it there now

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.930 
the rest of it and it holds it there now
this<00:02:30.870> is<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.080> really<00:02:31.560> small<00:02:31.620> chunk<00:02:32.280> compared<00:02:32.850> to

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
this is a really small chunk compared to

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.720 
this is a really small chunk compared to
what<00:02:33.060> I<00:02:33.090> would<00:02:33.210> normally<00:02:33.510> use<00:02:34.190> so<00:02:35.190> once<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.520> get

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
what I would normally use so once I get

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:40.300 
what I would normally use so once I get
it<00:02:35.880> up<00:02:36.000> there<00:02:36.210> I<00:02:37.940> just<00:02:38.940> hold<00:02:39.120> on<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.510> it

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
it up there I just hold on to it

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:48.190 
it up there I just hold on to it
pull<00:02:41.310> the<00:02:41.460> stick<00:02:41.760> out

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:54.729 

and<00:02:49.200> then<00:02:49.769> what<00:02:50.010> I<00:02:50.040> did<00:02:50.250> was<00:02:50.579> just<00:02:51.180> basically

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.929 

anything<00:02:55.739> that<00:02:56.159> I<00:02:56.370> have<00:02:56.730> to<00:02:56.969> do<00:02:58.609> to<00:02:59.609> make<00:02:59.760> it

00:02:59.929 --> 00:02:59.939 
anything that I have to do to make it

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:08.839 
anything that I have to do to make it
stay<00:03:03.590> so<00:03:04.590> that's<00:03:04.769> how<00:03:04.950> I<00:03:04.980> put<00:03:05.250> them<00:03:05.400> in<00:03:07.849> but

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:08.849 
stay so that's how I put them in but

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:14.420 
stay so that's how I put them in but
yeah<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.590> it's<00:03:10.620> pretty<00:03:10.950> simple<00:03:11.189> I<00:03:13.220> hope<00:03:14.220> that

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
yeah so it's pretty simple I hope that

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.550 
yeah so it's pretty simple I hope that
you<00:03:14.519> could<00:03:14.730> see<00:03:15.090> on<00:03:15.329> there<00:03:15.659> what<00:03:16.019> it<00:03:16.109> was<00:03:16.230> I<00:03:16.409> was

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
you could see on there what it was I was

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:27.800 
you could see on there what it was I was
doing<00:03:23.540> okay<00:03:24.540> once<00:03:24.810> more<00:03:26.150> try<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.180> bigger<00:03:27.510> chunk

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
doing okay once more try a bigger chunk

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.979 
doing okay once more try a bigger chunk
this<00:03:28.109> time<00:03:31.730> okay<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.120> I<00:03:33.150> take<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.599> at<00:03:33.689> the<00:03:33.810> end

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
this time okay so I take it at the end

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:44.409 
this time okay so I take it at the end
right<00:03:34.620> here<00:03:41.540> just<00:03:42.540> keep<00:03:42.810> wrapping<00:03:43.109> it<00:03:43.470> around

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:44.419 
right here just keep wrapping it around

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:47.240 
right here just keep wrapping it around
and<00:03:45.419> it's<00:03:45.750> okay<00:03:46.049> if<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.319> go<00:03:46.470> over<00:03:46.859> it<00:03:46.889> doesn't

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
and it's okay if you go over it doesn't

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.750 
and it's okay if you go over it doesn't
really<00:03:47.400> matter<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:48.750> then<00:03:49.230> hold<00:03:50.189> the<00:03:50.519> little

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
really matter and then hold the little

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.809 
really matter and then hold the little
end<00:03:51.269> there<00:03:52.639> and<00:03:53.750> curl<00:03:54.750> this<00:03:55.019> right<00:03:55.440> over<00:03:55.919> it<00:03:56.040> or

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
end there and curl this right over it or

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:02.210 
end there and curl this right over it or
wrap<00:03:57.090> it<00:03:59.989> move<00:04:00.989> the<00:04:01.019> same<00:04:01.290> thing<00:04:01.590> pull<00:04:02.129> this

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
wrap it move the same thing pull this

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.469 
wrap it move the same thing pull this
thing<00:04:02.489> out<00:04:02.729> pin<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:04.699> but<00:04:05.699> that's<00:04:05.819> how<00:04:05.970> I<00:04:06.060> put<00:04:06.389> it

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
thing out pin it but that's how I put it

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.449 
thing out pin it but that's how I put it
in<00:04:06.629> so<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.109> all<00:04:07.440> of<00:04:07.680> this<00:04:07.799> that<00:04:08.129> you<00:04:08.250> wrap

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
in so this all of this that you wrap

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.699 
in so this all of this that you wrap
around<00:04:08.489> it<00:04:09.060> pretty<00:04:09.359> much<00:04:09.510> curls<00:04:09.989> into<00:04:10.229> itself

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
around it pretty much curls into itself

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.680 
around it pretty much curls into itself
that's<00:04:11.519> why<00:04:11.639> I<00:04:11.699> kind<00:04:12.000> of<00:04:12.090> had<00:04:12.239> to<00:04:12.359> pull<00:04:12.599> it

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
that's why I kind of had to pull it

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.060 
that's why I kind of had to pull it
apart<00:04:12.780> when<00:04:13.290> I<00:04:13.319> took<00:04:13.440> it<00:04:13.620> out<00:04:14.389> so<00:04:15.389> I<00:04:15.419> hope<00:04:15.840> that

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
apart when I took it out so I hope that

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:22.850 
apart when I took it out so I hope that
helps<00:04:17.070> some<00:04:17.340> of<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.519> um<00:04:21.409> that's<00:04:22.409> pretty<00:04:22.680> much

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
helps some of you um that's pretty much

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.379 
helps some of you um that's pretty much
I<00:04:23.039> just<00:04:23.070> learned<00:04:23.610> how<00:04:23.729> to<00:04:23.820> do<00:04:24.030> it<00:04:24.150> on<00:04:24.210> my<00:04:24.270> own

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
I just learned how to do it on my own

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.300 
I just learned how to do it on my own
and<00:04:24.840> that<00:04:24.990> was<00:04:25.169> how<00:04:25.349> it<00:04:25.470> worked<00:04:25.620> so<00:04:25.860> that's<00:04:26.130> how

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
and that was how it worked so that's how

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.899 
and that was how it worked so that's how
I<00:04:26.370> always<00:04:26.789> continue<00:04:27.570> to<00:04:27.720> do<00:04:27.900> it<00:04:28.080> I<00:04:29.070> could<00:04:29.699> never

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:29.909 
I always continue to do it I could never

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:32.390 
I always continue to do it I could never
get<00:04:30.389> them<00:04:30.630> in<00:04:30.810> right<00:04:31.139> starting<00:04:31.889> from<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.250> end

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 
get them in right starting from the end

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.339 
get them in right starting from the end
and<00:04:32.639> trying<00:04:33.000> to<00:04:33.120> curl<00:04:33.360> up<00:04:33.630> the<00:04:33.870> way<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.050> would

00:04:34.339 --> 00:04:34.349 
and trying to curl up the way you would

00:04:34.349 --> 00:04:36.620 
and trying to curl up the way you would
with<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.650> curling<00:04:35.099> iron

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
with a curling iron

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.860 
with a curling iron
so<00:04:37.110> that<00:04:37.260> was<00:04:37.500> a<00:04:37.800> little<00:04:38.430> trick<00:04:39.389> I<00:04:39.510> guess<00:04:39.720> you

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:39.870 
so that was a little trick I guess you

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.080 
so that was a little trick I guess you
could<00:04:40.020> say<00:04:40.229> that<00:04:40.440> I<00:04:40.500> managed<00:04:40.979> to<00:04:41.159> figure<00:04:41.820> out

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:42.090 
could say that I managed to figure out

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.529 
could say that I managed to figure out
in<00:04:42.360> order<00:04:42.510> to<00:04:42.720> use<00:04:43.050> them<00:04:44.060> even<00:04:45.060> the<00:04:45.360> ones

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
in order to use them even the ones

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:48.200 
in order to use them even the ones
without<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:46.080> stick<00:04:46.349> I<00:04:46.680> can't<00:04:47.490> seem<00:04:47.789> to<00:04:47.820> use

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
without the stick I can't seem to use

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:49.770 
without the stick I can't seem to use
those<00:04:48.539> for<00:04:48.900> some<00:04:49.050> reason<00:04:49.500> I

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
those for some reason I

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.340 
those for some reason I
cannot<00:04:50.340> get<00:04:51.340> it<00:04:51.520> to<00:04:51.820> curl<00:04:52.210> I<00:04:52.690> can't<00:04:53.080> get<00:04:53.260> my

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:53.350 
cannot get it to curl I can't get my

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.790 
cannot get it to curl I can't get my
hair<00:04:53.590> to<00:04:53.920> wrap<00:04:54.370> around<00:04:54.400> it<00:04:54.880> and<00:04:55.030> stay<00:04:55.270> that<00:04:55.480> way

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
hair to wrap around it and stay that way

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.210 
hair to wrap around it and stay that way
but

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
but

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.820
