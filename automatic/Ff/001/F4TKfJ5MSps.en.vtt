00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
don't know so majority this episode was

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.229 
don't know so majority this episode was
basically<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.890> flashback<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.730> remainder<00:00:36.210> of

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
basically the flashback the remainder of

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.420 
basically the flashback the remainder of
what<00:00:36.450> happened<00:00:36.809> in<00:00:36.870> ketosis<00:00:37.200> past<00:00:37.680> and<00:00:37.980> things

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
what happened in ketosis past and things

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.860 
what happened in ketosis past and things
from<00:00:38.730> his<00:00:38.879> perspective<00:00:39.030> of<00:00:39.510> what<00:00:39.600> happened

from his perspective of what happened
with<00:00:39.960> doflamingo<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.800> guess<00:00:40.950> one<00:00:41.129> of<00:00:41.160> the

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
with doflamingo and I guess one of the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.130 
with doflamingo and I guess one of the
things<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.550> takes<00:00:42.210> away<00:00:42.390> from<00:00:42.540> like<00:00:43.020> you

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
things that takes away from like you

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.660 
things that takes away from like you
know<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.350> shock<00:00:43.590> value<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:44.070> anything<00:00:44.280> is<00:00:44.520> that

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
know the shock value of anything is that

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.790 
know the shock value of anything is that
we've<00:00:45.030> already<00:00:45.210> seen<00:00:45.629> this<00:00:45.960> flashback<00:00:46.289> in<00:00:46.590> a

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
we've already seen this flashback in a

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.350 
we've already seen this flashback in a
way<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.370> it<00:00:47.520> was<00:00:47.550> basically<00:00:47.940> from<00:00:48.270> a

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
way but it was basically from a

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.490 
way but it was basically from a
different<00:00:48.629> perspective<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.410> was

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
different perspective and it was

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.439 
different perspective and it was

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740

like towards the end until when he was
trying<00:01:31.890> to<00:01:32.009> get<00:01:32.100> to<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.280> Flamingo<00:01:32.520> even<00:01:33.060> cut

everything is like uh I think personally

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.460 
everything is like uh I think personally
that<00:03:40.150> it<00:03:40.389> adds<00:03:40.540> a<00:03:40.660> little<00:03:40.750> bit<00:03:40.900> more<00:03:41.169> to<00:03:41.440> the

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
that it adds a little bit more to the

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.319 
that it adds a little bit more to the
you<00:03:42.129> know<00:03:42.190> credibility<00:03:42.790> of<00:03:42.819> the<00:03:43.000> struggle

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
you know credibility of the struggle

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.670 
you know credibility of the struggle
that<00:03:43.359> they<00:03:43.540> went<00:03:43.780> through<00:03:43.930> because<00:03:44.049> like<00:03:44.349> you

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
that they went through because like you

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.470 
that they went through because like you
know<00:03:44.739> Frankie<00:03:45.129> just<00:03:45.340> got<00:03:45.489> dusted<00:03:46.000> he's<00:03:46.209> on<00:03:46.359> the

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
know Frankie just got dusted he's on the

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.939 
know Frankie just got dusted he's on the
ground<00:03:46.660> fucked<00:03:46.989> up<00:03:47.169> bloody<00:03:47.440> and<00:03:47.620> everything

ground fucked up bloody and everything

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:50.009 
ground fucked up bloody and everything
so<00:03:48.190> I<00:03:48.400> think<00:03:48.579> that<00:03:48.790> adds<00:03:48.970> more<00:03:49.239> like<00:03:49.660> holy<00:03:49.900> shit

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
so I think that adds more like holy shit

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:51.960 
so I think that adds more like holy shit
this<00:03:50.260> straw<00:03:50.709> hats<00:03:50.889> are<00:03:51.069> in<00:03:51.099> a<00:03:51.220> bind<00:03:51.400> but<00:03:51.940> I

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.339

was like Frankie he just jokes around
people<00:03:56.349> don't<00:03:56.500> care<00:03:56.650> for<00:03:56.829> his<00:03:56.919> design<00:03:57.280> and

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
people don't care for his design and

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:59.250 
people don't care for his design and
then<00:03:58.000> we<00:03:58.090> come<00:03:58.269> to<00:03:58.299> dress<00:03:58.569> roast<00:03:58.810> and<00:03:58.989> he<00:03:59.049> gets

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
annihilated so yeah and then we got

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:02.490 
annihilated so yeah and then we got
something<00:04:01.569> else<00:04:01.720> instead<00:04:01.959> so<00:04:02.230> so<00:04:02.410> they

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:02.500 
something else instead so so they

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.470

squeezed<00:04:02.859> in<00:04:03.099> towards<00:04:03.489> the<00:04:03.519> end<00:04:03.760> a<00:04:04.030> lot<00:04:04.269> more

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480

liked it a lot of people didn't like

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:13.680 
liked it a lot of people didn't like
this<00:05:11.380> in<00:05:11.560> the<00:05:11.650> manga<00:05:11.860> what<00:05:12.490> usopp<00:05:12.940> I<00:05:13.120> mean<00:05:13.300> they

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
this in the manga what usopp I mean they

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.170 
this in the manga what usopp I mean they
he<00:05:14.169> he<00:05:14.590> kind<00:05:15.010> of<00:05:15.100> accomplished<00:05:15.850> the<00:05:16.000> boat

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
he he kind of accomplished the boat

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.450 
he he kind of accomplished the boat
regardless<00:05:16.810> of<00:05:16.930> how<00:05:16.990> it<00:05:17.260> was<00:05:17.380> done<00:05:17.620> so<00:05:17.950> I<00:05:18.190> think

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:18.460 
regardless of how it was done so I think

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.400 
regardless of how it was done so I think
some<00:05:19.120> credit<00:05:19.480> do<00:05:19.600> not<00:05:19.870> to<00:05:19.990> mention<00:05:20.260> that<00:05:20.290> he

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
some credit do not to mention that he

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.960 
some credit do not to mention that he
brings<00:05:20.650> up<00:05:20.860> a<00:05:20.980> couple<00:05:21.160> episodes<00:05:21.550> ago<00:05:21.610> as<00:05:21.820> well
