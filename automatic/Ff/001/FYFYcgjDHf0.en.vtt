00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:08.880
 Hahaha, please, today, our problem here. 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:12.049
 space will be the reservoir one 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.790
 The reservoir here starts cold. 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:18.539
 well the problem he has here is the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:32.870
 next gasoline is put there 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:40.320
 underneath the car tips below 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:49.829
 probably the bomb is down there 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:53.719
 We need to take the tire here and strip it. 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:01:01.890
 this plastic protection 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:05.600
 so come on now we take out 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.600
 all screws that she has 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:22.170
 so let's not goose goose 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:24.290
 I discovered where the leaking mistake is. 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.290
 gasoline down 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.290
 here in the 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:36.780
 however that Michael is healed 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.780
 a drunken sound also does not see 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.060
 I got here, there is a damn job in 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:02:06.300
 who goes there on top of that tank 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.300
 it was very good 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:16.959
 so I realized what happened 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:20.620
 business that put water inside the 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:25.840
 supply gasoline 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:28.800
 The reservoir, since everything has already been 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.220
 full of water a dirty rotten water 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.110
 mixed with gasoline and it was even good that 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.269
 I did not like it was bad, it's not 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:42.910
 running because that mimimi inject 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:45.370
 water inside the engine still butterfly and 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.640
 business then okay guys with 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.890
 help from my helper who gifted it to us 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.549
 Let's try to show who gets the bomb. 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.549
 it's working 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.010
 on here 

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:13.939
 or else it fills the compartment 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:17.629
 here the main gasoline is the cap and 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:21.640
 It is not leaking but weighs no pump 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.640
 now I just want to go back 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.620
 I tried injecting myself with a mistake to find 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.389
 but I think it will not work 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.500
 room temperature here is very 

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:37.419
 high 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:41.659
 You are doing here about 29 degrees 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:44.109
 I do not think it's going to happen, not much. 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.109
 heat 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.830
 and here is the villain of the smell of 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.220
 gasoline in the car 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:10.959
 It's china is going bad with the smell 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:13.799
 gasoline had been the crowd that 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:16.750
 shorty latest changed by this 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:22.150
 failure only if it arrives the concessionaire asks 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:25.630
 is the sealing rubber of the reservoir 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:32.740
 cold start is from the previous 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:36.600
 she goes in that hole here so here 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:40.289
 the detail of the mangueirinha 

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.289
 The cost I told you
