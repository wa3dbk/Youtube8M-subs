hello this is dan Thyra from logical

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.210 
hello this is dan Thyra from logical
advantage<00:00:03.900> and<00:00:04.080> today<00:00:04.380> I'm<00:00:04.500> going<00:00:04.560> to<00:00:04.770> demo<00:00:05.040> my

squirt gun the squirt gun is controlled

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.620 
squirt gun the squirt gun is controlled
by<00:00:07.709> a<00:00:07.830> net<00:00:08.040> jointed<00:00:08.400> microcontroller<00:00:09.150> that's

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
by a net jointed microcontroller that's

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:11.990 
by a net jointed microcontroller that's
actually<00:00:10.080> inside<00:00:10.349> the<00:00:10.530> house<00:00:10.910> there's<00:00:11.910> a

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
actually inside the house there's a

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.579 
actually inside the house there's a
control<00:00:12.330> panel<00:00:12.540> here<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:13.200> want<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.379> push

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:13.589 
control panel here you want to push

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.820 
control panel here you want to push
these<00:00:13.769> buttons<00:00:15.049> the<00:00:16.049> niche<00:00:16.170> weena<00:00:16.379> tells<00:00:16.710> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
these buttons the niche weena tells the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.450 
these buttons the niche weena tells the
survey<00:00:18.260> with<00:00:19.260> program<00:00:19.650> just<00:00:19.830> runs<00:00:20.039> around<00:00:20.220> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
survey with program just runs around the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.410 
survey with program just runs around the
edge<00:00:20.609> of<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.849> pool

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.570 

and<00:00:25.420> I'll<00:00:26.020> run<00:00:26.140> another<00:00:26.440> program<00:00:26.920> and<00:00:27.220> now<00:00:27.460> if

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:27.580 
and I'll run another program and now if

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:29.840 
and I'll run another program and now if
you<00:00:27.670> could<00:00:27.790> focus<00:00:28.000> a<00:00:28.240> little<00:00:28.330> bit<00:00:28.450> on<00:00:28.750> the

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:29.850 
you could focus a little bit on the

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.450 
you could focus a little bit on the
service<00:00:30.850> itself

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.069 

so<00:00:37.460> the<00:00:37.790> nedwin<00:00:38.180> is<00:00:38.329> telling<00:00:38.630> the<00:00:38.720> server<00:00:38.960> is

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
so the nedwin is telling the server is

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.910 
so the nedwin is telling the server is
where<00:00:39.320> to<00:00:39.410> go<00:00:42.640> and<00:00:44.379> one<00:00:45.379> of<00:00:45.410> the<00:00:45.530> other<00:00:45.559> really

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
where to go and one of the other really

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.430 
where to go and one of the other really
cool<00:00:46.129> features<00:00:46.550> of<00:00:46.730> this<00:00:46.879> is<00:00:47.120> over<00:00:47.900> here<00:00:48.199> is<00:00:48.379> a

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
cool features of this is over here is a

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.130 
cool features of this is over here is a
garden<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:49.820> I<00:00:49.910> can<00:00:50.059> turn<00:00:50.180> the<00:00:50.330> water<00:00:50.449> on<00:00:50.600> in

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
garden and I can turn the water on in

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.880 
garden and I can turn the water on in
the<00:00:51.230> garden<00:00:52.300> by<00:00:53.300> pushing<00:00:53.570> the<00:00:53.780> button<00:00:54.110> but

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:54.890 
the garden by pushing the button but

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.650 
the garden by pushing the button but
also<00:00:55.070> i<00:00:55.280> wrote<00:00:55.580> a<00:00:55.610> program<00:00:55.879> on<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.239> net<00:00:56.480> we

00:00:56.650 --> 00:00:56.660 
also i wrote a program on the net we

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.049 
also i wrote a program on the net we
know<00:00:56.720> that<00:00:57.410> during<00:00:58.220> certain<00:00:58.489> times<00:00:58.610> in<00:00:58.940> the

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
know that during certain times in the

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.819 
know that during certain times in the
day<00:00:59.239> it<00:00:59.570> will<00:00:59.629> run<00:00:59.839> the<00:00:59.960> garden<00:01:00.290> for<00:01:00.320> half<00:01:00.710> an

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
day it will run the garden for half an

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.910 
day it will run the garden for half an
hour<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.220> then<00:01:01.309> turn<00:01:01.640> off<00:01:02.530> okay<00:01:03.530> i'm<00:01:03.739> going<00:01:03.860> to

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
hour and then turn off okay i'm going to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.290 
hour and then turn off okay i'm going to
go<00:01:04.009> upstairs<00:01:04.159> and<00:01:04.489> show<00:01:04.759> you<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.909> really<00:01:05.089> cool

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
go upstairs and show you the really cool

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.850 
go upstairs and show you the really cool
stuff<00:01:05.479> but<00:01:05.930> before<00:01:06.050> I<00:01:06.229> do<00:01:06.380> I'm<00:01:06.530> going<00:01:06.619> to<00:01:06.680> play

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
stuff but before I do I'm going to play

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:22.560 
stuff but before I do I'm going to play
a<00:01:06.890> game<00:01:07.130> with<00:01:07.280> jump<00:01:07.490> rope<00:01:07.700> with<00:01:07.729> the<00:01:08.030> netduino

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:25.810 

so<00:01:23.570> upstairs<00:01:24.080> that<00:01:24.530> has<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.740> connect<00:01:25.160> it

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
so upstairs that has a connect it

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.760 
so upstairs that has a connect it
connect<00:01:26.150> is<00:01:26.330> wired<00:01:26.540> to<00:01:26.840> a<00:01:26.870> computer<00:01:27.260> and<00:01:27.590> to

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
connect is wired to a computer and to

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.680 
connect is wired to a computer and to
Annette<00:01:28.040> dueno<00:01:28.370> he<00:01:28.880> built<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.150> code<00:01:29.360> for<00:01:29.600> the

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
Annette dueno he built a code for the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.380 
Annette dueno he built a code for the
netduino<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:30.979> that<00:01:31.100> he<00:01:31.190> can<00:01:31.490> control<00:01:32.240> the

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
netduino so that he can control the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.480 
netduino so that he can control the
squirt<00:01:32.630> gun<00:01:32.660> with<00:01:33.530> this<00:01:33.740> right<00:01:33.950> hand<00:01:34.220> while

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
squirt gun with this right hand while

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.130 
squirt gun with this right hand while
using<00:01:34.729> his<00:01:34.940> left<00:01:35.150> hand<00:01:35.390> to<00:01:35.630> turn<00:01:35.780> it<00:01:35.900> on<00:01:35.990> and

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
using his left hand to turn it on and

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.070 
using his left hand to turn it on and
off<00:01:36.280> to<00:01:37.280> turn<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.610> off<00:01:37.729> he<00:01:38.540> straightens<00:01:38.960> his

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
off to turn it off he straightens his

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.760 
off to turn it off he straightens his
arm<00:01:39.290> and<00:01:39.470> turn<00:01:39.800> it<00:01:39.890> off<00:01:40.040> up<00:01:40.360> he<00:01:41.360> bends<00:01:42.020> it<00:01:42.170> quite

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
arm and turn it off up he bends it quite

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:53.330 
arm and turn it off up he bends it quite
simply

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.490 

I<00:01:55.039> got<00:01:56.039> squirted<00:01:58.130> there<00:01:59.130> you<00:01:59.310> have
