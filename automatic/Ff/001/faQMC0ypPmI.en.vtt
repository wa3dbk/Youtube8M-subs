00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
so in this rhythm exercise we're going

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:18.680 
so in this rhythm exercise we're going
to<00:00:16.350> practice<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:17.460> rhythmical<00:00:18.060> elements<00:00:18.570> of

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
to practice the rhythmical elements of

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.689 
to practice the rhythmical elements of
the<00:00:18.779> notes<00:00:19.050> which<00:00:19.619> will<00:00:19.770> make<00:00:19.830> an<00:00:19.980> easier<00:00:20.340> when

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
the notes which will make an easier when

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.179 
the notes which will make an easier when
you're<00:00:20.850> reading<00:00:21.060> music<00:00:21.330> in<00:00:21.830> the<00:00:22.830> way<00:00:22.949> we're

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
you're reading music in the way we're

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.790 
you're reading music in the way we're
isolating<00:00:23.550> one<00:00:24.029> specific<00:00:24.720> area<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.470> rhythm

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
isolating one specific area the rhythm

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.400 
isolating one specific area the rhythm
in<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.939> way<00:00:27.119> that<00:00:27.420> will<00:00:27.570> come<00:00:27.750> naturally<00:00:27.930> as

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
in that way that will come naturally as

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.189 
in that way that will come naturally as
you<00:00:28.439> trying<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> find<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:29.760> notes<00:00:30.199> we're

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
you trying to find the notes we're

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.319 
you trying to find the notes we're
dealing<00:00:31.500> with<00:00:31.529> quarter<00:00:32.399> rest<00:00:32.579> and<00:00:32.880> quarter

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
dealing with quarter rest and quarter

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.979 
dealing with quarter rest and quarter
notes<00:00:33.540> let's<00:00:34.020> take<00:00:34.140> a<00:00:34.200> look<00:00:35.540> so<00:00:36.540> here<00:00:36.840> we<00:00:36.960> have

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
notes let's take a look so here we have

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.619 
notes let's take a look so here we have
a<00:00:37.170> quarter<00:00:37.649> note<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.579> here<00:00:39.360> we<00:00:39.510> have<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
a quarter note and here we have a

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.220 
a quarter note and here we have a
quarter<00:00:40.079> rest<00:00:40.320> each<00:00:40.620> of<00:00:40.829> them<00:00:40.920> get<00:00:41.160> one<00:00:41.550> beat

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
quarter rest each of them get one beat

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.229 
quarter rest each of them get one beat
now<00:00:43.789> you'll<00:00:44.789> have<00:00:44.879> here<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.870> half<00:00:46.739> note<00:00:47.670> rest

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
now you'll have here a half note rest

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.430 
now you'll have here a half note rest
half<00:00:49.110> rest<00:00:49.879> sit<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> line<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.750> gets<00:00:52.260> two

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
half rest sit on the line and gets two

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.180 
half rest sit on the line and gets two
beats<00:00:53.510> the<00:00:54.510> half<00:00:54.719> rest<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.500> whole<00:00:55.770> rest

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
beats the half rest and the whole rest

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.729 
beats the half rest and the whole rest
look<00:00:56.610> very<00:00:56.850> similar<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.960> way<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.109> remember<00:00:58.289> it

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
look very similar the way I remember it

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.250 
look very similar the way I remember it
is<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> half<00:00:59.340> rest<00:00:59.699> sits<00:01:00.359> on<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.719> line<00:01:00.930> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
is the half rest sits on the line and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.460 
is the half rest sits on the line and
that<00:01:01.820> whole<00:01:02.820> rest<00:01:03.210> hangs<00:01:03.629> from<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:03.930> line<00:01:04.199> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that whole rest hangs from the line I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.399 
that whole rest hangs from the line I
say<00:01:04.949> to<00:01:05.010> myself<00:01:05.189> half<00:01:05.640> is<00:01:05.939> like<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:06.299> hat<00:01:06.630> looks

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
say to myself half is like a hat looks

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.039 
say to myself half is like a hat looks
like<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> hat<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.400> whole<00:01:08.549> hangs<00:01:09.049> usually

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
like a hat and the whole hangs usually

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.170 
like a hat and the whole hangs usually
once<00:01:10.229> i<00:01:10.350> get<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> half<00:01:10.860> hat<00:01:11.310> part<00:01:11.790> i<00:01:12.030> can

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
once i get the half hat part i can

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.620 
once i get the half hat part i can
remember<00:01:12.360> the<00:01:12.630> whole<00:01:12.810> hangs<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.970> we<00:01:15.150> also<00:01:15.299> have

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
remember the whole hangs so we also have

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.289 
remember the whole hangs so we also have
a<00:01:15.659> whole<00:01:15.990> note<00:01:16.500> here<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.820> whole<00:01:17.970> note<00:01:18.150> gets

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
a whole note here in a whole note gets

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.080 
a whole note here in a whole note gets
four<00:01:18.570> counts<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.979> half<00:01:20.189> note<00:01:20.490> which<00:01:20.850> gets

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
four counts and a half note which gets

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.070 
four counts and a half note which gets
two<00:01:21.659> counts<00:01:22.430> let's<00:01:23.430> try<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:24.330> first<00:01:24.720> line

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
two counts let's try this first line

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.460 
two counts let's try this first line
here<00:01:25.470> together<00:01:25.670> I'll<00:01:26.670> count<00:01:27.420> to<00:01:27.689> four<00:01:28.200> and
