00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:05.040
 sony ericsson w100 useful 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.960
 after boxing we see 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.789
 in detail this small terminal 

00:00:09.789 --> 00:00:13.029
 and cell phone that weighs just 90 grams 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.769
 has a height of 92 millimeters 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.359
 in the richness of 48 with a thickness of about 17,000 of mind 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.779
 at the top there is the entrance to make the headphones deck 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.210
 standard for iphone 5mm 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.700
 on the left side and present entry for names with which one b 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.950
 then to recharge the terminal 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.930
 on the right side it comes out 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:44.280
 d are the pearl keys the der woodsen control 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.240
 at the rear we find a camera 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.680
 from 2 megapixels so clearly photos and videos will not be of great quality 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.140
 and then here instead we have a kit speaker on the contrary is very soft 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.360
 we can see from this w posted es a back but also in the part 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.740
 front is a terminal that is part of the wooden walkman 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.140
 of estonia dixon therefore a terminal suitable especially mom to those who 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.290
 they listen to lots of fields 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.300
 the keys that we find on the front of the phone are dedicated 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:22.369
 just that 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.430
 so we have the key 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.870
 it that pause 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:27.820
 central 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.140
 the keys for certain is changed livescore pevaryl songs a dedicated key 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.710
 own man with this w 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.590
 placed above 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.610
 then we have the function keys on the top of the infinity start keys loved 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.480
 key to cancel and this instead 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.390
 a button that allows us to enter the robbery selection menu 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.600
 I do or see immediately 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.490
 because it is a mobile that this design then slides 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.220
 the keyboard is very small but actually made of thulium becomes 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.659
 you can still write the text of a message in a very convenient way 

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:13.999
 itaca is immediately this. 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.359
 here it is 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:18.100
 the quantity that is accessed precisely 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.100
 with this key also directly dalmine 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:22.629
 with the menu 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.249
 scrolling we have immediately the function 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:26.329
 Walkman 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:28.239
 select 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.969
 and here we are in this - 

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:34.719
 we can insert all the songs that we prefer taking into account however that 

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:39.959
 indispensable for external memory because the internal memory of this 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.349
 morning edit 5 megabasket terminal so we can really insert them 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.269
 very little 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.409
 the done listening and a song 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.259
 p 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:18.269
 huh 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.269
 huh 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:22.489
 here it is 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.689
 claudio you really good 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:30.060
 another function it because we find in this device 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.399
 the most. and this of the three d 

00:03:33.399 --> 00:03:36.040
 is an application that allows you to 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.930
 those moments when we are listening to a song maybe around a center 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:40.889
 commercial 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.869
 and we do not know in the title you come also the artist 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:50.519
 artist world with this applications following an internet connection 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:55.260
 we go out to get the chocolate information 1 reading age we will be able to 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.829
 directly download it 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.869
 from this little end them 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:03.719
 but it must be said, however, that it was still a mobile phone that air 

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:06.109
 simply du albenga 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.559
 that does not support me does not support him for years he makes my two friends if that 

00:04:11.559 --> 00:04:14.779
 simply around 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.909
 hence the somewhat mentan collector 

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:22.949
 it's an old woman looking for me inside 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.500
 a female radio movie 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.230
 there is also the whole blue that is really important considering that 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:34.230
 a pack. very useless data cable 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.350
 and it's a phone that goes together 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.750
 climax I find it quite about freedom 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.930
 there is to consider there is also to consider that 1 excellent relationship 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.039
 quality price 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.050
 in the sense that 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.570
 this device is the blade from 50 euros 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:57.069
 the targeted missions 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:03.120
 up to a maximum of 70 80 euros for other colors 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.879
 the other breakfasts are on the front in white 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.080
 always polished but this niro 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.199
 and the thing that changed was the back side of the keyboard 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:16.469
 that we can find in Rome 

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:17.909
 or in green 

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:20.909
 or in the next one 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:24.639
 it's a cell phone then who is clearly not me 

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:28.290
 for those functions we find today 

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:33.840
 how do you want to do gps or many others because it is also true that 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.419
 and in any case a cell phone that 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:39.910
 act 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:44.460
 they don't look for much from a device but simply need to 

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.199
 that maritime bari 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:49.990
 messages that maybe sometimes listen to that bit of music 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.169
 the one mtv brand beats around a thousand miles inland 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.449
 you can't safely finish a couple of days 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.449
 also with a click on meteo.it 

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:05.749
 other took battery-powered apple for up to 3 days 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:11.439
