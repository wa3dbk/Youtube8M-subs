out is that's your stash goes across all
of<00:01:22.049> your<00:01:22.170> characters<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.009> should<00:01:23.310> save

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
of your characters so you should save

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.730

plan<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.220> keeping<00:01:26.549> for<00:01:26.909> another<00:01:27.090> class<00:01:27.450> that

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
plan on keeping for another class that

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.859 
plan on keeping for another class that
you're<00:01:27.780> gonna<00:01:27.900> level<00:01:28.320> also<00:01:29.070> your<00:01:29.250> professions

because everyone was asking how I had a
different<00:02:06.990> amount<00:02:07.230> of<00:02:07.440> buttons<00:02:08.430> or<00:02:08.550> whatever

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
different amount of buttons or whatever

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.330 
different amount of buttons or whatever
then<00:02:09.150> the<00:02:09.720> default<00:02:10.320> number<00:02:10.619> so<00:02:11.040> I<00:02:11.070> just

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
then the default number so I just

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.470 
then the default number so I just
thought<00:02:11.760> it'd<00:02:11.880> to<00:02:11.970> make<00:02:12.060> this<00:02:12.150> little<00:02:12.390> video

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
thought it'd to make this little video

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.970 
thought it'd to make this little video
showing<00:02:12.720> how<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.050> do<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.470> really<00:02:13.650> quickly

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
showing how to do that really quickly

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.760
