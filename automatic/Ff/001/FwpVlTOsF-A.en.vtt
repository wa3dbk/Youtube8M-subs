00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 good 2 m2 a new video we are in the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.859
 plan is to see your garden worker zombies and 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.460
 well let's go there as you see is a shooter 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.780
 in third person how good it gives 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.790
 being zombie touches you is the pose no 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.619
 you have to go killing and such and such 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.470
 then upload to a gameplay with elias in 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.760
 the cooperative mode and such because in this 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.100
 country that can not be invited is a 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.860
 mega putada 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.270
 and it's a bitch the truth or you can not 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.690
 or I do not have we have no fucking idea 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.690
 how to do it 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.680
 Let's see 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.680
 they are all sites 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.980
 I do not know with care because I do not have 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:43.980
 almost life 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.280
 the plant is not dead 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.539
 we will receive until 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.539
 comes someone true 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.780
 more previous 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:08.410
 around here it seems that all the people are 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:08.410
 cold this young woman who scared 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.770
 when it's supposed that someone already 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.770
 cago 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.140
 with this agenda 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.580
 the farthest you do not know 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.580
 further what can not be 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:32.080
 morel dies or magnesium 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.080
 They are not killing at the same time 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.350
 or the truth that is a game that if you are 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.900
 good you kill is a game that you 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.190
 Pretty reward for your skill 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.700
 something that is appreciated because lately 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.680
 it's not like that or coÃ±a 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.850
 I'm pretty cool because you have a lot 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.479
 multitude of digital skills 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.479
 Let's see 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.420
 in rows 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.220
 they kill me this one was surrounded 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.970
 but what expensive apostles it seems 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.970
 you support 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.830
 a pimp support for the chicken and fierce god 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.610
 an opponent the mouse very the management 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.980
 there is a plant 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.220
 already dead he was hiding eggs 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.220
 and hosts 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.300
 good the failed missile 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.300
 by all 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.680
 let's go up because here 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:05.900
 dead we are also doing 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.900
 Roberto also opens my streak of 5 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.390
 that has killed me 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.989
 I shit on the strain 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.210
 well I do not have much experience with what 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.300
 what if they kill me weird things I do not know what 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:24.890
 balls are 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.170
 it's kind of like typical tics and my niece 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.290
 out there singing like someone who does not want 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.290
 thing 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.750
 if the area 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:48.860
 returned no no no no no no eat me no me 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.860
 commas do not eat me 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.569
 what a bitch 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.500
 the first one is pretty good enough 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.500
 pretty good, nothing more 

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.780
 it's like I say pretty funny there's no 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:05.360
 many maps that many of the 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:07.040
 criticism of the game is that to me what 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.820
 it bothers me, it was not if you invite 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.820
 friends but good 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.650
 above all you know if you like to put it 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.820
 with your like because it is appreciated 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:20.260
 pretty animal 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.260
 work that many people time 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.990
 you die 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:30.490
 quarter 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:33.800
 fuck that killed me unlocked the 

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:35.620
 most valuable marker 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.570
 well, we won 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.020
 overwhelming victory always tend to do 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:45.009
 they are always like that 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.259
 fought is not won here for a long time 

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:48.580
 well first with ten casualties here 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.560
 usually kill like this an average of nine or 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.610
 ten the first so well I hope that 

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:53.319
 you liked to leave the like 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.360
 favorites and nothing see you in the next 

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:58.210
 gameplay that will be the cooperative of 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:00.900
 game by waves and such with elias and nothing 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.900
 until next time 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
 Y 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.229
 two
