the next thing I'd like to share with
you<00:00:04.110> is<00:00:04.350> about<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.609> use<00:00:05.819> of<00:00:05.850> diagonals<00:00:06.779> and

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
you is about the use of diagonals and

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.110 
you is about the use of diagonals and
understanding<00:00:07.890> the<00:00:08.010> diagonals<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:08.820> work

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
understanding the diagonals that work

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.360 
understanding the diagonals that work
within<00:00:09.719> our<00:00:10.019> body<00:00:10.290> when<00:00:10.679> we're<00:00:10.860> moving<00:00:11.219> in

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
within our body when we're moving in

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.820 
within our body when we're moving in
dents<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:12.000> want<00:00:12.929> you<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.110> just<00:00:13.320> think<00:00:13.590> of<00:00:13.679> the

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
dents I want you to just think of the

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.580 
dents I want you to just think of the
most<00:00:14.040> natural<00:00:14.639> thing<00:00:15.000> that<00:00:15.299> you<00:00:15.599> do<00:00:15.870> every<00:00:16.410> day

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
most natural thing that you do every day

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.250 
most natural thing that you do every day
when<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.640> wake<00:00:17.820> up<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.270> get<00:00:18.480> out<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.630> bed<00:00:18.930> and

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
when you wake up you get out of bed and

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.689 
when you wake up you get out of bed and
you<00:00:19.740> walk<00:00:20.660> right<00:00:21.660> just<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.800> natural<00:00:23.100> thing

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
you walk right just the natural thing

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.750 
you walk right just the natural thing
that<00:00:23.910> we<00:00:24.029> all<00:00:24.180> do<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.689> walking<00:00:25.260> if<00:00:25.529> you<00:00:26.310> notice

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
that we all do is walking if you notice

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.790 
that we all do is walking if you notice
when<00:00:26.970> I'm<00:00:27.150> walking<00:00:27.720> what<00:00:28.019> is<00:00:28.170> happening<00:00:28.650> with

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
when I'm walking what is happening with

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.730 
when I'm walking what is happening with
my<00:00:28.980> arms<00:00:29.420> there<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.570> a<00:00:30.599> natural<00:00:30.929> swinging

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
my arms there is a natural swinging

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.700 
my arms there is a natural swinging
going<00:00:31.890> on<00:00:32.189> of<00:00:32.460> my<00:00:32.489> arms<00:00:33.090> right<00:00:34.050> which<00:00:34.500> is

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
going on of my arms right which is

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.250 
going on of my arms right which is
producing<00:00:35.550> an<00:00:35.820> energy<00:00:36.270> this<00:00:36.540> where<00:00:36.960> this

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
producing an energy this where this

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.200 
producing an energy this where this
where<00:00:37.680> this<00:00:37.950> where<00:00:38.280> across<00:00:38.930> my<00:00:39.930> body<00:00:40.760> right<00:00:41.760> we

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
where this where across my body right we

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.750 
where this where across my body right we
don't<00:00:42.360> walk<00:00:42.719> like<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:44.570> and<00:00:46.489> sometimes<00:00:47.489> when

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
don't walk like this and sometimes when

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.150 
don't walk like this and sometimes when
we<00:00:47.789> dance<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.329> think<00:00:48.600> we<00:00:48.899> think<00:00:49.590> have<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> think

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
we dance we think we think have to think

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.130 
we dance we think we think have to think
so<00:00:50.370> much<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.550> posture<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.780> we've<00:00:51.930> become

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
so much of posture that we've become

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.130 
so much of posture that we've become
very<00:00:52.739> very<00:00:53.010> wooden<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:53.670> stiff<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.719> want<00:00:55.079> you

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
very very wooden and stiff so I want you

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.619 
very very wooden and stiff so I want you
to<00:00:55.260> all<00:00:55.500> think<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.399> most<00:00:56.730> natural<00:00:57.390> thing

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
to all think of the most natural thing

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.900 
to all think of the most natural thing
that<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.899> do<00:00:58.140> when<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.530> walk<00:00:58.770> and<00:00:59.190> it's

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
that you do when you walk and it's

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.219 
that you do when you walk and it's
allowing<00:01:00.359> your<00:01:00.989> arms<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.770> swing<00:01:02.960> by<00:01:03.960> your

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
allowing your arms to swing by your

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.219 
allowing your arms to swing by your
sides<00:01:04.589> with<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.339> momentum<00:01:06.000> opposite<00:01:06.960> side<00:01:07.200> of

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
sides with a momentum opposite side of

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.460 
sides with a momentum opposite side of
the<00:01:07.530> body<00:01:07.710> working<00:01:08.610> with<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.240> leg<00:01:09.450> when<00:01:10.320> we

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
the body working with the leg when we

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.830 
the body working with the leg when we
move<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.890> dance<00:01:11.130> we're<00:01:11.460> going<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.820> do<00:01:11.970> exactly

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
move in dance we're going to do exactly

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.109 
move in dance we're going to do exactly
the<00:01:13.110> same<00:01:13.140> thing<00:01:13.770> so<00:01:14.430> when<00:01:14.580> we<00:01:14.700> put<00:01:14.970> our

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
the same thing so when we put our

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.480 
the same thing so when we put our
posture<00:01:15.720> on<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.080> we<00:01:16.170> line<00:01:16.470> our<00:01:16.500> body<00:01:17.009> up<00:01:17.280> and

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
posture on and we line our body up and

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.749 
posture on and we line our body up and
we<00:01:17.610> think<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.150> our<00:01:18.840> Center<00:01:19.470> right<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.369> don't

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
we think of our Center right I don't

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.120 
we think of our Center right I don't
need<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.090> suddenly<00:01:21.450> think<00:01:21.630> huh<00:01:22.130> ballroom

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
need to suddenly think huh ballroom

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.310 
need to suddenly think huh ballroom
dancing<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.759> must<00:01:24.030> stare<00:01:24.270> still<00:01:24.630> that's<00:01:24.990> not

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
dancing I must stare still that's not

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.679 
dancing I must stare still that's not
how<00:01:25.530> we<00:01:25.590> move<00:01:25.890> at<00:01:26.009> all<00:01:26.189> we<00:01:26.700> must<00:01:26.970> never<00:01:27.210> hold

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
how we move at all we must never hold

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.490 
how we move at all we must never hold
our<00:01:27.960> bones

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
our bones

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.280 
our bones
so<00:01:29.240> understanding<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.299> diagonals<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
so understanding the diagonals in the

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.560 
so understanding the diagonals in the
body<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.130> first<00:01:32.460> thing<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.119> walk

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
body the first thing we do is just walk

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.730 
body the first thing we do is just walk
and<00:01:33.930> see<00:01:34.590> how<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.860> arms<00:01:35.490> naturally<00:01:35.820> swing<00:01:36.740> now

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
and see how the arms naturally swing now

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.609 
and see how the arms naturally swing now
what<00:01:38.400> I'd<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.700> you<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:38.939> do<00:01:39.210> is<00:01:39.450> just<00:01:40.049> take<00:01:40.560> a

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
what I'd like you to do is just take a

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.810 
what I'd like you to do is just take a
stationary<00:01:41.369> position<00:01:41.610> and<00:01:42.240> feel<00:01:43.820> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
stationary position and feel the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.260 
stationary position and feel the
diagonal<00:01:45.659> motion<00:01:46.369> working<00:01:47.369> as<00:01:47.520> we<00:01:47.729> compress

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
diagonal motion working as we compress

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.990 
diagonal motion working as we compress
the<00:01:48.509> knee<00:01:48.659> from<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.200> shoulder<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.770> one<00:01:50.640> hip

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the knee from one shoulder to one hip

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.719 
the knee from one shoulder to one hip
and<00:01:51.240> again<00:01:52.049> from<00:01:52.740> another<00:01:52.799> shoulder<00:01:53.549> to<00:01:53.700> the

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
and again from another shoulder to the

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.389 
and again from another shoulder to the
opposite<00:01:54.240> hip<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:54.869> notice<00:01:55.470> my<00:01:56.130> right

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
opposite hip so if you notice my right

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.730 
opposite hip so if you notice my right
shoulder<00:01:56.700> is<00:01:56.969> working<00:01:57.299> with<00:01:57.420> my<00:01:57.570> left<00:01:57.869> hip<00:01:58.110> my

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
shoulder is working with my left hip my

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.440 
shoulder is working with my left hip my
left<00:01:59.070> shoulder<00:01:59.490> is<00:01:59.549> working<00:01:59.880> with<00:02:00.030> my<00:02:00.210> right

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
left shoulder is working with my right

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.670 
left shoulder is working with my right
hip<00:02:00.659> so<00:02:00.990> worth<00:02:01.460> constantly<00:02:02.460> changing<00:02:03.680> through

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
hip so worth constantly changing through

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.399 
hip so worth constantly changing through
compression<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:05.790> diagonal<00:02:06.689> through<00:02:07.110> our<00:02:07.170> body

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
compression a diagonal through our body

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.290 
compression a diagonal through our body
so<00:02:07.649> if<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:07.979> simply<00:02:08.429> try<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:08.879> exercise

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
so if you just simply try this exercise

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.580 
so if you just simply try this exercise
of<00:02:10.489> rotation<00:02:11.489> don't<00:02:12.209> hold<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.900> stern

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
of rotation don't hold the stern

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.449 
of rotation don't hold the stern
so<00:02:14.280> strong<00:02:15.090> that<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:16.050> knees<00:02:16.319> won't<00:02:16.620> Bend<00:02:17.069> and

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
so strong that the knees won't Bend and

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.839 
so strong that the knees won't Bend and
it<00:02:17.610> won't<00:02:17.880> relate<00:02:18.390> with<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.140> natural<00:02:19.860> gravity

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
it won't relate with a natural gravity

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:23.500 
it won't relate with a natural gravity
action<00:02:21.360> taking<00:02:21.810> place<00:02:21.840> into<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.860> legs<00:02:23.130> and

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
action taking place into the legs and

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.330 
action taking place into the legs and
into<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.630> hip<00:02:24.840> so<00:02:25.110> think<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.650> this<00:02:25.860> nice

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
into the hip so think of this nice

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.240 
into the hip so think of this nice
relaxed<00:02:27.150> feeling<00:02:27.530> then<00:02:28.530> what<00:02:28.739> I'd<00:02:28.860> like<00:02:29.040> you

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
relaxed feeling then what I'd like you

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.880 
relaxed feeling then what I'd like you
to<00:02:29.310> do<00:02:29.610> is<00:02:30.170> walk<00:02:31.170> forward<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:33.090> feel<00:02:33.890> how

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
to do is walk forward and just feel how

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.620 
to do is walk forward and just feel how
about<00:02:35.220> diagonal<00:02:36.349> action<00:02:37.489> takes<00:02:38.489> place<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:39.360> the

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
about diagonal action takes place in the

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.530 
about diagonal action takes place in the
body<00:02:39.840> now<00:02:40.830> what<00:02:41.430> I<00:02:41.459> am<00:02:41.580> NOT<00:02:41.970> trying<00:02:42.300> to

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
body now what I am NOT trying to

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.250 
body now what I am NOT trying to
emphasize<00:02:43.110> here<00:02:43.170> is<00:02:44.180> what<00:02:45.180> we<00:02:45.330> call<00:02:45.660> negative

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
emphasize here is what we call negative

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.430 
emphasize here is what we call negative
rotation<00:02:47.030> now<00:02:48.030> if<00:02:48.269> when<00:02:48.480> we<00:02:48.630> walk<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.930> see

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
rotation now if when we walk you see

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.590 
rotation now if when we walk you see
this<00:02:49.650> happen<00:02:50.160> what<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.400> don't<00:02:50.760> want<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.150> do<00:02:51.330> is

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
this happen what I don't want to do is

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.860 
this happen what I don't want to do is
focus<00:02:51.959> on<00:02:52.260> what<00:02:53.190> is<00:02:53.340> going<00:02:53.700> on<00:02:53.850> behind<00:02:54.150> my<00:02:54.660> body

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
focus on what is going on behind my body

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.670 
focus on what is going on behind my body
but<00:02:55.500> simply<00:02:56.130> everything<00:02:56.940> being<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.690> projective

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
but simply everything being a projective

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.830 
but simply everything being a projective
energy<00:02:59.190> moving<00:02:59.580> forward<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.330> when<00:03:00.480> we<00:03:00.599> dance

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
energy moving forward so when we dance

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:03.740 
energy moving forward so when we dance
we<00:03:01.140> even<00:03:01.709> though<00:03:02.069> we<00:03:02.250> have<00:03:02.519> opposite<00:03:03.420> side<00:03:03.720> of

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
we even though we have opposite side of

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.110 
we even though we have opposite side of
the<00:03:04.019> body<00:03:04.170> working<00:03:04.530> with<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.069> moving<00:03:05.400> leg<00:03:05.580> we

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
the body working with the moving leg we

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.820 
the body working with the moving leg we
don't<00:03:06.390> want<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:06.690> think<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:07.049> anything<00:03:07.380> being

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
don't want to think of anything being

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.449 
don't want to think of anything being
negative<00:03:08.549> so<00:03:09.330> as<00:03:09.540> I'm<00:03:09.989> walking<00:03:10.220> forward<00:03:11.220> I'm

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
negative so as I'm walking forward I'm

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.839 
negative so as I'm walking forward I'm
only<00:03:12.150> thinking<00:03:12.720> about<00:03:13.260> what's<00:03:14.130> happening<00:03:14.730> in

00:03:14.839 --> 00:03:14.849 
only thinking about what's happening in

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:17.210 
only thinking about what's happening in
front<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.330> my<00:03:15.510> body<00:03:15.720> I<00:03:16.049> am<00:03:16.590> NOT<00:03:16.860> walking

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
front of my body I am NOT walking

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.330 
front of my body I am NOT walking
thinking<00:03:18.109> this<00:03:19.109> diagonals<00:03:19.769> got<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.130> go<00:03:20.280> to

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
thinking this diagonals got to go to

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.789 
thinking this diagonals got to go to
here<00:03:20.730> this<00:03:21.209> one<00:03:21.510> then<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.870> here<00:03:22.079> I'm<00:03:22.230> only

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
here this one then to here I'm only

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.650 
here this one then to here I'm only
thinking<00:03:23.400> of<00:03:24.590> projective<00:03:27.079> diagonal<00:03:28.370> energy

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
thinking of projective diagonal energy

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.500 
thinking of projective diagonal energy
working<00:03:30.660> across<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.769> body<00:03:31.980> so<00:03:32.730> when<00:03:33.299> you're

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
working across the body so when you're

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.039 
working across the body so when you're
trying<00:03:33.840> this<00:03:34.170> exercise<00:03:35.450> try<00:03:36.450> not<00:03:36.720> to<00:03:36.900> go<00:03:37.019> a

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
trying this exercise try not to go a

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:40.430 
trying this exercise try not to go a
step<00:03:37.440> change<00:03:37.519> step<00:03:38.519> change<00:03:39.090> keep<00:03:39.840> the<00:03:40.049> knees

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
step change step change keep the knees

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.819 
step change step change keep the knees
in<00:03:40.859> a<00:03:41.090> relaxed<00:03:42.090> flex<00:03:42.389> manner<00:03:42.720> connect<00:03:43.680> the

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
in a relaxed flex manner connect the

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:48.970 
in a relaxed flex manner connect the
shoulders<00:03:44.340> down<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:45.049> simply<00:03:46.049> try<00:03:46.500> and<00:03:47.810> feel

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
shoulders down and simply try and feel

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.289 
shoulders down and simply try and feel
this<00:03:50.000> diagonal<00:03:51.650> connection<00:03:52.970> taking<00:03:53.970> place

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
this diagonal connection taking place

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:56.809 
this diagonal connection taking place
and<00:03:54.690> understanding<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.380> diagonals<00:03:56.040> that<00:03:56.670> are

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
and understanding the diagonals that are

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.319 
and understanding the diagonals that are
naturally<00:03:57.600> happening<00:03:58.200> within<00:03:58.590> our<00:03:58.859> body<00:03:59.329> and

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
naturally happening within our body and

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:02.809 
naturally happening within our body and
now<00:04:00.959> what<00:04:01.139> I'd<00:04:01.260> like<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:01.650> show<00:04:01.889> you<00:04:01.920> is<00:04:02.310> a

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:02.819 
now what I'd like to show you is a

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.979 
now what I'd like to show you is a
feeling<00:04:03.690> from<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:05.040> back<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.579> my<00:04:05.760> body<00:04:06.000> so

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
feeling from the back of my body so

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.220 
feeling from the back of my body so
simply<00:04:07.590> what<00:04:07.769> I'd<00:04:07.889> like<00:04:08.069> you<00:04:08.250> to<00:04:08.370> do<00:04:08.579> and<00:04:09.230> take

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
simply what I'd like you to do and take

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.340 
simply what I'd like you to do and take
note<00:04:10.530> of<00:04:10.560> watch<00:04:11.040> is<00:04:11.489> if<00:04:11.819> I<00:04:11.910> put<00:04:12.239> the<00:04:12.510> back<00:04:12.870> of<00:04:13.139> my

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
note of watch is if I put the back of my

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.560 
note of watch is if I put the back of my
hand<00:04:13.739> across<00:04:14.959> my<00:04:15.959> right<00:04:16.289> lat<00:04:16.680> and<00:04:17.299> I'm<00:04:18.299> simply

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
hand across my right lat and I'm simply

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:22.190 
hand across my right lat and I'm simply
going<00:04:18.900> to<00:04:19.109> bring<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.590> arm<00:04:20.070> down<00:04:21.080> across<00:04:22.080> the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
going to bring that arm down across the

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.100 
going to bring that arm down across the
back<00:04:22.650> and<00:04:23.010> up<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.430> other<00:04:23.460> side<00:04:23.640> I'm<00:04:24.630> going<00:04:24.990> to

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
back and up the other side I'm going to

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.170 
back and up the other side I'm going to
change<00:04:25.409> my<00:04:25.650> arms<00:04:25.979> and<00:04:26.159> think

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
change my arms and think

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.930 
change my arms and think
what<00:04:27.479> my<00:04:27.720> lat<00:04:28.050> is<00:04:28.289> doing<00:04:28.740> it's<00:04:29.400> going<00:04:29.639> to<00:04:29.729> keep

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
what my lat is doing it's going to keep

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.379 
what my lat is doing it's going to keep
changing<00:04:30.660> from<00:04:31.050> one<00:04:31.380> side<00:04:31.770> to<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.669> next

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
changing from one side to the next

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.620 
changing from one side to the next
now<00:04:34.110> then<00:04:34.789> sometimes<00:04:35.789> when<00:04:36.000> I'm<00:04:36.150> teaching

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
now then sometimes when I'm teaching

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.890 
now then sometimes when I'm teaching
this<00:04:36.720> exercise<00:04:37.380> people<00:04:38.310> say<00:04:39.150> to<00:04:39.210> me<00:04:39.330> are<00:04:39.780> you

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
this exercise people say to me are you

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.900 
this exercise people say to me are you
thinking<00:04:40.259> about<00:04:40.530> what's<00:04:40.800> going<00:04:41.070> up<00:04:41.370> or<00:04:41.580> what's

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
thinking about what's going up or what's

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.999 
thinking about what's going up or what's
going<00:04:42.270> down<00:04:42.300> and<00:04:42.870> the<00:04:43.410> answer<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:43.889> that

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
going down and the answer to that

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.370 
going down and the answer to that
question<00:04:44.520> is<00:04:44.639> I'm<00:04:44.820> thinking<00:04:45.240> of<00:04:45.360> both<00:04:45.630> but

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
question is I'm thinking of both but

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.129 
question is I'm thinking of both but
everything<00:04:47.039> starts<00:04:47.669> through<00:04:48.300> a<00:04:48.360> connection

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:49.139 
everything starts through a connection

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:52.790 
everything starts through a connection
going<00:04:49.770> down<00:04:50.190> first<00:04:50.699> so<00:04:51.090> the<00:04:51.300> lat<00:04:52.050> is<00:04:52.470> working

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
going down first so the lat is working

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.150 
going down first so the lat is working
down<00:04:53.340> and<00:04:53.850> I'm<00:04:54.389> thinking<00:04:54.990> of<00:04:55.110> the<00:04:55.289> energy<00:04:55.949> that

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
down and I'm thinking of the energy that

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.090 
down and I'm thinking of the energy that
is<00:04:56.669> now<00:04:56.910> going<00:04:57.210> up<00:04:57.449> through<00:04:58.169> that<00:04:58.199> diagonal

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100 
is now going up through that diagonal

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.700 
is now going up through that diagonal
and<00:04:59.460> it's<00:05:00.030> connecting<00:05:00.539> down<00:05:00.840> and<00:05:01.199> going<00:05:01.530> up

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
and it's connecting down and going up

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.950 
and it's connecting down and going up
but<00:05:02.310> I'm<00:05:02.400> not<00:05:02.580> just<00:05:02.849> focused<00:05:03.300> on<00:05:03.479> one<00:05:03.720> I'm

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
but I'm not just focused on one I'm

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.050 
but I'm not just focused on one I'm
focused<00:05:04.440> on<00:05:04.590> them<00:05:04.740> both<00:05:04.979> but<00:05:05.280> it<00:05:05.430> starts<00:05:05.880> by

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
focused on them both but it starts by

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.510 
focused on them both but it starts by
working<00:05:06.539> down<00:05:06.780> then<00:05:07.380> back<00:05:07.710> up<00:05:07.889> the<00:05:08.039> back<00:05:08.250> and

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
working down then back up the back and

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.330 
working down then back up the back and
down<00:05:09.360> and<00:05:09.690> back<00:05:09.870> up<00:05:09.900> the<00:05:10.050> back<00:05:10.349> so<00:05:10.710> if<00:05:10.919> you

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
down and back up the back so if you

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:14.510 
down and back up the back so if you
don't<00:05:11.639> feel<00:05:12.150> the<00:05:12.509> use<00:05:13.259> of<00:05:13.500> diagonals<00:05:14.190> in<00:05:14.370> the

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:14.520 
don't feel the use of diagonals in the

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.100 
don't feel the use of diagonals in the
body<00:05:14.729> by<00:05:14.970> looking<00:05:15.449> at<00:05:15.599> it<00:05:15.720> from<00:05:15.900> the<00:05:16.080> front

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
body by looking at it from the front

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.439 
body by looking at it from the front
view<00:05:16.770> you<00:05:17.009> can<00:05:17.520> actually<00:05:17.550> see<00:05:18.240> what's

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
view you can actually see what's

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:22.279 
view you can actually see what's
happening<00:05:19.199> in<00:05:19.410> the<00:05:20.160> back<00:05:20.370> as<00:05:20.940> I'm<00:05:21.930> changing

00:05:22.279 --> 00:05:22.289 
happening in the back as I'm changing

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:26.779 
happening in the back as I'm changing
from<00:05:23.009> left<00:05:23.849> to<00:05:24.030> right<00:05:24.360> now<00:05:25.199> then<00:05:25.639> when<00:05:26.639> you

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
from left to right now then when you

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:30.020 
from left to right now then when you
first<00:05:27.180> try<00:05:27.599> this<00:05:27.660> and<00:05:28.229> you<00:05:28.919> put<00:05:29.220> the<00:05:29.370> hand<00:05:29.699> on

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
first try this and you put the hand on

exercise that may happen but from from

exercise that may happen but from from
this<00:05:44.310> point<00:05:44.729> if<00:05:44.909> you<00:05:45.030> can<00:05:45.210> see<00:05:45.449> I'm<00:05:45.599> using<00:05:45.630> my

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
this point if you can see I'm using my

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.649 
this point if you can see I'm using my
hands<00:05:46.440> on<00:05:46.560> my<00:05:46.590> back<00:05:46.889> and<00:05:47.729> I'm<00:05:47.849> trying<00:05:48.210> to<00:05:48.389> keep

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
hands on my back and I'm trying to keep

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.420 
hands on my back and I'm trying to keep
my<00:05:48.840> shoulders<00:05:49.470> even<00:05:49.919> though<00:05:50.039> there's<00:05:50.310> an

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
my shoulders even though there's an

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.879 
my shoulders even though there's an
angle<00:05:50.880> coming<00:05:51.270> through<00:05:51.479> the<00:05:51.630> body<00:05:51.810> I'm<00:05:52.050> trying

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
angle coming through the body I'm trying

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:55.010 
angle coming through the body I'm trying
to<00:05:53.130> stop<00:05:53.460> my<00:05:53.729> shoulders<00:05:54.240> from<00:05:54.419> creeping<00:05:54.840> up

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
to stop my shoulders from creeping up

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.990 
to stop my shoulders from creeping up
around<00:05:55.260> my<00:05:55.440> ears<00:05:55.470> that<00:05:55.889> will<00:05:56.070> cause<00:05:56.310> tension

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000 
around my ears that will cause tension

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.749 
around my ears that will cause tension
and<00:05:57.180> stop<00:05:57.930> the<00:05:58.470> range<00:05:58.710> of<00:05:58.889> flexibility<00:05:59.490> being

00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 
and stop the range of flexibility being

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.439 
and stop the range of flexibility being
complete<00:06:00.330> so<00:06:01.020> we're<00:06:01.139> going<00:06:01.259> to<00:06:01.320> relax<00:06:01.770> and

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:02.449 
complete so we're going to relax and

00:06:02.449 --> 00:06:04.790 
complete so we're going to relax and
relax<00:06:03.449> I'll<00:06:03.810> take<00:06:04.080> that<00:06:04.229> from<00:06:04.409> the<00:06:04.590> back<00:06:04.770> again

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:04.800 
relax I'll take that from the back again

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.189 
relax I'll take that from the back again
and<00:06:05.870> one<00:06:06.870> and<00:06:07.789> two<00:06:08.789> so<00:06:09.090> you<00:06:09.180> can<00:06:09.240> feel<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:09.840> use

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
and one and two so you can feel the use

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:15.230 
and one and two so you can feel the use
of<00:06:11.210> diagonals<00:06:12.409> working<00:06:13.409> within<00:06:14.370> the<00:06:14.610> body<00:06:14.820> if

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 
of diagonals working within the body if

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.409 
of diagonals working within the body if
you<00:06:15.900> can<00:06:16.139> feel<00:06:16.560> that<00:06:16.860> natural<00:06:17.490> walking<00:06:17.729> action

00:06:18.409 --> 00:06:18.419 
you can feel that natural walking action

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.159 
you can feel that natural walking action
the<00:06:18.990> crisscross<00:06:19.770> in<00:06:20.159> front<00:06:20.789> of<00:06:20.940> the<00:06:21.000> body<00:06:21.240> no

00:06:22.159 --> 00:06:22.169 
the crisscross in front of the body no

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:24.710 
the crisscross in front of the body no
negative<00:06:22.710> rotation<00:06:23.460> then<00:06:23.639> try<00:06:23.970> the<00:06:24.030> exercise

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
negative rotation then try the exercise

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.200 
negative rotation then try the exercise
by<00:06:25.020> using<00:06:25.680> the<00:06:25.949> back<00:06:26.190> of<00:06:26.220> the<00:06:26.520> hand<00:06:26.759> on<00:06:26.909> the<00:06:27.030> lap

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
by using the back of the hand on the lap

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:30.890 
by using the back of the hand on the lap
muscle<00:06:27.630> to<00:06:28.520> continue<00:06:29.520> to<00:06:29.699> exercise<00:06:30.300> and<00:06:30.599> feel

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
muscle to continue to exercise and feel

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.649 
muscle to continue to exercise and feel
how<00:06:31.169> the<00:06:31.199> back<00:06:31.620> is<00:06:31.860> working<00:06:32.460> like<00:06:33.060> this<00:06:33.360> when

00:06:33.649 --> 00:06:33.659 
how the back is working like this when

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:36.350 
how the back is working like this when
we're<00:06:33.840> dancing<00:06:34.320> that<00:06:34.830> will<00:06:35.130> definitely<00:06:36.090> help

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 
we're dancing that will definitely help
