00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.760 
stone farm I believe you need a level 34
hero<00:01:51.390> but<00:01:51.659> if<00:01:51.750> you're<00:01:51.899> any<00:01:52.259> other<00:01:52.500> type<00:01:52.740> of

hero but if you're any other type of
farm<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.220> believe<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> level<00:01:53.880> 33<00:01:54.149> will<00:01:54.450> cut<00:01:54.630> it<00:01:54.780> I

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
farm I believe a level 33 will cut it I

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.480 
farm I believe a level 33 will cut it I
might<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.500> wrong<00:01:55.680> but<00:01:55.920> that's<00:01:56.100> just<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.310> rough

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
might be wrong but that's just a rough

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.520 
might be wrong but that's just a rough
estimate<00:01:56.939> also<00:01:57.390> doing<00:01:57.899> this<00:01:57.990> allows<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.409> to

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
estimate also doing this allows you to

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.380 
estimate also doing this allows you to
build<00:01:58.740> your<00:01:58.829> resource<00:01:59.490> buildings<00:01:59.880> up<00:01:59.969> faster

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
build your resource buildings up faster

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.760 
build your resource buildings up faster
since<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.719> have<00:02:00.840> construction<00:02:01.229> boosts<00:02:01.590> which

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
since you have construction boosts which

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.859 
since you have construction boosts which
is<00:02:02.040> very<00:02:02.430> helpful<00:02:02.700> when<00:02:02.969> constructing<00:02:03.509> a<00:02:03.600> farm

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
is very helpful when constructing a farm

do this in inverse order because level

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.920 
do this in inverse order because level
three<00:02:42.280> wood<00:02:42.490> production<00:02:42.670> gives<00:02:43.209> way<00:02:43.660> more

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
three wood production gives way more

increased the fastest on your farm is to

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.570 
increased the fastest on your farm is to
start<00:02:50.350> at<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.500> bottom<00:02:50.680> then<00:02:51.010> work<00:02:51.130> backwards

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
start at the bottom then work backwards

and then after your hero levels up quite
a<00:02:53.860> bit<00:02:54.100> you<00:02:54.250> can<00:02:54.370> start<00:02:54.610> putting<00:02:54.820> points<00:02:55.420> and

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
a bit you can start putting points and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.380 
a bit you can start putting points and
silver<00:02:56.050> production<00:02:56.520> because<00:02:57.520> once<00:02:58.090> you

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
silver production because once you

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.780 
silver production because once you

thousand silvered an hour but it's going
to<00:03:17.560> increase<00:03:17.860> and<00:03:18.450> eventually<00:03:19.450> my<00:03:19.690> hero<00:03:19.930> will

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:20.140 
to increase and eventually my hero will

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.630 
to increase and eventually my hero will
level<00:03:20.410> up<00:03:20.500> more<00:03:20.709> and<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:21.040> can<00:03:21.220> just<00:03:21.370> put<00:03:21.519> more

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
level up more and I can just put more

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.570 
level up more and I can just put more
skill<00:03:21.880> points<00:03:21.910> in<00:03:22.300> silver<00:03:22.750> and<00:03:23.190> it'll<00:03:24.190> produce

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
skill points in silver and it'll produce

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.570 
skill points in silver and it'll produce
a<00:03:25.030> decent<00:03:25.720> bit<00:03:25.810> eventually<00:03:26.230> I<00:03:26.430> also<00:03:27.430> might

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
a decent bit eventually I also might

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.710 
a decent bit eventually I also might
want<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.790> note<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.239> you<00:03:28.330> should<00:03:28.360> probably

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:28.720 
want to note that you should probably

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.870 
want to note that you should probably
approach<00:03:29.170> the<00:03:29.380> silver<00:03:29.830> production<00:03:30.430> in<00:03:30.790> the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
approach the silver production in the

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.030 
approach the silver production in the
same<00:03:31.120> technique<00:03:31.660> go<00:03:32.290> for<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.560> level<00:03:32.709> three

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
same technique go for a level three

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.770 
same technique go for a level three
silver<00:03:33.310> production<00:03:33.580> first<00:03:34.060> fill<00:03:34.390> that<00:03:34.510> up<00:03:34.690> and

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
silver production first fill that up and

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.750 
silver production first fill that up and
then<00:03:34.900> work<00:03:35.050> backwards<00:03:35.340> it's<00:03:36.340> gonna<00:03:36.489> take<00:03:36.730> a

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
then work backwards it's gonna take a

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.580 
then work backwards it's gonna take a
pretty<00:03:37.060> high<00:03:37.239> level<00:03:37.300> hero<00:03:37.720> though<00:03:37.959> to<00:03:38.019> get<00:03:38.350> all

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
pretty high level hero though to get all

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.620 
pretty high level hero though to get all
of<00:03:38.800> those<00:03:38.950> filled<00:03:39.220> up<00:03:39.400> so<00:03:40.120> yeah<00:03:40.360> that's<00:03:40.570> about

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
of those filled up so yeah that's about

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.270 
of those filled up so yeah that's about
it<00:03:40.810> guys<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.200> just<00:03:41.350> wanted<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.650> show<00:03:41.830> those<00:03:42.100> of

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
it guys I just wanted to show those of

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.860 
it guys I just wanted to show those of
you<00:03:42.400> who<00:03:42.519> were<00:03:42.610> unaware<00:03:42.880> of<00:03:43.360> how<00:03:43.810> to

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
you who were unaware of how to

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.199 
you who were unaware of how to
efficiently<00:03:44.560> make<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.799> hyper<00:03:45.160> farm<00:03:45.519> the

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
efficiently make a hyper farm the

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.670 
efficiently make a hyper farm the
correct<00:03:46.480> way<00:03:46.630> to<00:03:46.660> do<00:03:46.900> it<00:03:47.080> at<00:03:47.260> least<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.530> way<00:03:47.650> I

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
correct way to do it at least the way I

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.380 
correct way to do it at least the way I
feel<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.160> should<00:03:48.340> be<00:03:48.430> done<00:03:48.580> as<00:03:48.880> I've<00:03:49.209> known

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
feel it should be done as I've known

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.690 
feel it should be done as I've known
this<00:03:49.510> for<00:03:49.750> quite<00:03:50.019> a<00:03:50.049> bit<00:03:50.170> of<00:03:50.290> farms<00:03:50.709> and<00:03:51.010> have

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
this for quite a bit of farms and have

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.340 
this for quite a bit of farms and have
noticed<00:03:52.090> this<00:03:52.150> is<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.420> best<00:03:52.600> way<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.810> produce

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350 
noticed this is the best way to produce

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.910 
noticed this is the best way to produce
the<00:03:53.680> fastest<00:03:54.130> and<00:03:54.400> grow<00:03:54.910> pretty<00:03:55.239> fast<00:03:55.299> -<00:03:55.920> thank

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
the fastest and grow pretty fast - thank

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:58.170 
the fastest and grow pretty fast - thank
you<00:03:57.010> so<00:03:57.160> much<00:03:57.310> for<00:03:57.430> watching<00:03:57.549> you<00:03:57.850> guys<00:03:58.030> are

you so much for watching you guys are

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.230 
you so much for watching you guys are
great<00:03:58.330> we'll<00:03:58.690> see<00:03:58.840> you<00:03:58.900> next<00:03:59.019> time
