00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:04.410
 but I recognize him this right of agreement 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.430
 I grant him you specify that I have 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.250
 ate meat for twenty years m 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.530
 and it will come from something that I have 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:14.700
 often crossed the integrists of the stuff 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:17.039
 and I recognize him this virtue it's 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.090
 that his investigation and argued searched it 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.090
 there are real arguments 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.100
 there are real issues of society 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.949
 world we will say which I adhere 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.300
 I know that tomorrow what I'm doing I 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.640
 am a producer of beef 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.309
 charolais fed on the grass 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.899
 it's a luxury product tomorrow there 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.880
 will have an elite of the world who will 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.260
 to eat that that's another debate that 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.180
 is very interesting you noticed 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.100
 also since you have the book that I 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.200
 pay tribute to what I call the 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.820
 peasants who are doing very well 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.579
 occupation they apparently belonged 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.260
 people who love their animals 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.489
 people do not need it tell us 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.710
 nothing to take our animals to slaughter 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.440
 but it's really I used to 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.660
 vicois she pleaded that the animals 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.340
 have a social conscience and pain 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.690
 and it's a stupid argument but that 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.690
 it's important and why does it explain 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.189
 but because to the animal and and I can 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.990
 to guarantee you that even eva I love them 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.970
 like my kids 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.850
 except that 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.830
 it's meant to be eaten at the 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:14.960
 destination firstly enough made to be 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.120
 ate what why it's made to be 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.210
 ate a bovine granny of doubts born you 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:22.010
 this truth ben because man in 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:24.590
 rock in the construction of 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.990
 humanity existed before even cunin 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.970
 on a species but if it goes wrong this 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.170
 either at rebecca come from europe in the 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.490
 major breakdown major guests like 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.020
 animals because they are 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.220
 needs of the clubs happened he got 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.740
 says what is edible so 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.300
 the weather is always breeds 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.740
 mixed would otherwise be sure that you 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.960
 go back on the history of consciousness 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.490
 animal to tell you that consciousness 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.900
 I'm going to tell you that the hand on 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.630
 the animal is a stupidity 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.570
 we arrive I arrive and all 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.479
 peasants have found it by 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.250
 regular moments by regular noises 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:56.990
 to make sure that our animals 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.190
 understand that is what is 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.259
 to happen in the day 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.520
 the simplest thing but you are and 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.690
 the one who is proving that they 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.320
 have a conscience and I can finish my 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.259
 argumentation 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.970
 the simplest thing is that when 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.369
 the tractor that gives to puff starts 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.360
 the cow goes to bavay one could 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:11.870
 believe she has a soul and a 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.230
 consciousness 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.959
 except that this animal you take it you 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.700
 give him a caesarean section 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.350
 so here we are going to drift on things 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.239
 more technical but when we do a 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.850
 caesarean animal there is anesthesia 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:28.670
 local and speed of intervention 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.239
 do times the anesthetic does not have the 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.610
 time to act 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:32.390
 it hurts him we agree that's him 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.250
 it hurts 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.080
 except that the next day you come back 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.010
 dressed in the same way 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.070
 with the same honors 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.290
 the animal will not be angry at you 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:43.519
 beat an animal the day tomorrow it does not 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.810
 you will not want to stop it in 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:45.620
 wrong if I can afford that 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.120
 all investigations were conducted 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.590
 especially as regards for example 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.989
 foie gras by an association that 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.000
 is called l214 explains you very well 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:56.430
 than the ducks that we give 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.470
 in a rather abominable way withdrew 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.510
 he retired but no I saw the pictures 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.950
 to dishonest intellectual honesty 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.840
 current I saw the pictures I saw the 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.290
 angloys park naturally from 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.000
 figs 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:07.620
 that's how we discovered canada 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.060
 talking about ducks because 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.620
 not because it's still what 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.240
 regards the majority the ducks by 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.860
 example they are made to fatten the liver by 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.560
 say yes to twenty days this 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.420
 which is completely unnatural 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.830
 windsor that we have them we have 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.030
 causes them an illness called 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.260
 fatty liver 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.670
 so stop talking about phenomenon 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.170
 natural ducks when we come for 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:26.820
 force-feed it every day this fall 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.400
 especially not to argue must for 

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.320
 do not receive this treatment 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.970
 so it's not true to say that the animal 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.650
 do not remember the farmer's life 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.940
 which is taking place right now is hurting the 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.860
 book is called no steak 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.090
 he signs aymeric caron he is with 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.770
 we today are going to talk about this 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.180
 perspective actually are we going towards 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:43.590
 a world that we will consume less and 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.840
 less meat what are the reasons 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.530
 also then the economic stake has everything from 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:48.530
 following 32 16
