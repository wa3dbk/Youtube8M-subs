00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.360
 let's go to it 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.160
 hello very good friends from youtube my 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.110
 name was watching and today I bring you the 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:17.240
 guide of jacques the master of weapons 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.920
 I have to say jazz is one of the 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.290
 strongest champions in the one against 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:23.600
 one and as more goes lengthening the 

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.420
 strongest game is this champion 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:28.670
 I also have to say that it is one of 

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:32.390
 my favorite mentor champions and that's why 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.330
 today I bring you the guide of already is well 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.150
 what friends are we going to good friends 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:41.510
 let's start with your passive assault 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.190
 implacable stability what makes 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.680
 the basic attack consecutive of ya 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.230
 increases its attack speed for 2 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.920
 second and a half with a maximum of 6 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.920
 accumulations 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.010
 this that appears here the number of 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.399
 accumulations that we have of our 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.399
 passive 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.080
 let's go now to see his first skill 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.640
 what is your jump hit 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.310
 What this skill does is that 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.740
 jump towards an enemy target and 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.869
 will do more physical damage this skill does 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.869
 scale with ap and conade 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.500
 also this skill can not serve 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.720
 on difficult occasions to escape from 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.630
 enemy since we can jump to a 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:41.289
 Allied unit whether they are champion minions 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:44.229
 war or theme mushrooms in this case I will 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:45.760
 put a guard on the other side of the wall and 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:49.290
 how will they see 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.290
 they will jump the wall 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.470
 Let us now see what your w empowerment 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.900
 that does stability is that it is already loaded 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.380
 his cane and the next basic attack or 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.690
 hit in jump performs magic damage 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.929
 additional this skill scales with 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.929
 ap 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.550
 we see their counter what 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.190
 does this skill is that it is already adopted 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.860
 a defensive position during a maximum 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.620
 of 2 seconds and dodge all 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.740
 attacks you receive suffering 25% 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.630
 less damage past two seconds or if 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.970
 we click again does not extract 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.130
 jacques stuns enemies who 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.800
 surround for a second and inflicts 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.100
 Physical damage also this skill 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.410
 inflicts 20% more light damage per 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.660
 every attack that has already been avoided 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:02.660
 up to a maximum of 100% 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.049
 and finally let's see his last skill 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:21.690
 He refers to its master this skill 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.330
 passively each treats that already 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.069
 inflicts additional magic damage and if the 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.010
 we activate we will obtain armors 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:31.379
 equivalent to a base value at 30% of 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.510
 your attack damage and we will also get 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:35.819
 magic resistance equivalent to a 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.489
 base value to 20% of its power of 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.489
 skill all this for 8 seconds 

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.340
 let's now look at the order in which 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.880
 we should not raise the skills with 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.980
 jacques that will be as it appears in 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:05.570
 the graph giving priority in the 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:07.950
 levels 6 11 and 16 to our ere let's move 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.730
 now to see the masters 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:14.989
 we will be 21 points in attack and 9 in 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:18.870
 defense as it appears on the graph 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:22.079
 and finally the runes in brand 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:26.460
 penetration of armor on stamps 

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:29.790
 armor in tap magic resistance and 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:32.550
 in quintessence attack damage too 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.889
 the quintessence of attack damage the 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.630
 We can substitute quintessentially 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.510
 Life stealing 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:42.240
 good friends now let's see the wii of 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.950
 summoner spell yaks we will choose 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.740
 turn on and flash 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:50.750
 of starting item we can choose several 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.210
 options 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:56.090
 well we can start with some boots 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:58.970
 speed and four potions an armor 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:01.580
 of cloth and five potions a cloak of 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:05.210
 cancellation of magic and two potions a 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:07.310
 sword where does it last what I advise that 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:10.760
 depending on the champion that we 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.980
 tap on the top line choose a cloak 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:15.280
 of magic nullification or an armor of 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.280
 cloth 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:22.940
 after the start time we 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:25.460
 we buy some speed boots 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.340
 after the speed boots we 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:30.800
 we bought a vampiric scepter and then the 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:34.120
 vampire scepter we would climb them to a saber 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.470
 of standing water after the saber 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:38.360
 we need some defense and I 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.020
 I usually buy a belt 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.919
 giant 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:46.710
 after the title the saber will go up 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.040
 to a sheet of the ruined king and then 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:50.050
 from this 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.630
 the belt 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:56.060
 I would upload it to a dewarman armor 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.710
 after the warm armor or the 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:02.510
 boots there were 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.510
 to some mercury boots 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:10.450
 after giving mercury boots 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:10.450
 I get a trinity 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:16.969
 after the trinity 

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:19.759
 I make myself a saber and pistol 

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:21.390
 and after the saber gun an angel of 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:23.700
 the guard 

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:27.680
 now let's see the objects 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:30.980
 situational well for example if the 

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.980
 counter peak 

00:06:31.139 --> 00:06:37.460
 it's up to singer 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:40.440
 before the ruined king blade not 

00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:42.570
 would do more than a phase of bad mortis 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:44.990
 that gives us magic resistance and damage 

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:44.990
 Of attack 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:51.990
 or if for example in the game 

00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:55.300
 our car and enemy is very holiday 

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.420
 we can buy an omen of rne 

00:06:55.300 --> 00:07:00.289
 uy 

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:03.050
 or a heart of ice 

00:07:00.289 --> 00:07:07.909
 also a viable item is a layer of 

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:10.650
 solar fire that gives us life and armor and 

00:07:07.909 --> 00:07:12.930
 also a mesh of thorns 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:16.139
 and as always I tell you about objects 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:18.800
 necessary whenever I give you a 

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:23.990
 little bit of money get us a guard 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.990
 of vision award and total vision 

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:30.680
 So much for the will of yaks 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:37.590
 well now let's see the counter pib 

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:39.360
 of yaks that are bad faith hai xing and 

00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:41.400
