00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.880
 Stork follows 

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:07.060
 Burkhard Kornherr to get the magazine on the weekend at MDS 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.680
 he works today in Bern said exciting it will not believe 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.230
 but today I have an incredibly interesting post about 

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:18.800
 that clearly 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.800
 Well, I'm very curious and pictures 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:27.439
 the bills in the field 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.460
 You never know if you first put the rear wheels in the front corner 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.149
 Movie theaters 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:32.790
 and how to eat "complains 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.970
 in our today's show Meinersen the story the bed with him 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.730
 deal with and find out 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.730
 I never had any form of tutoring in the team 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.670
 if they refer to beds an issue that affects us all 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.480
 in no other situation 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.750
 everyone is allowed to work then pleasure as clearly as here 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.410
 because after all, you can only be made to sleep well. " 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.410
 You have to do it yourself 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.220
 I'm in Hanau 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.560
 how it could go is not exactly 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.550
 a pillow 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:13.810
 so that 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.320
 So now this is who in the life "with pillows 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.020
 Fact is even seen as a gang 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.480
 so the pillow year is a zillion little nose smaller than the ceiling for example 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.760
 or even a mattress so at the beginning of this recognized me that Gesine related 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.500
 and with a specific calculation and once included 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.689
 if the magnifying glass 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:37.720
 he gets it after its inventor 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.920
 Earth Manfred Kampelmann Heinzmann 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.030
 and then this 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.080
 Manfred purely wanted was a home game 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.450
 and in your own 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.290
 Schramm Heimfall dive truck with beds 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.510
 in the flat 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.510
 So he welcomed for the first time heard 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.890
 and prompt her 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.749
 the team to choose from so 

00:01:59.749 --> 00:02:01.640
 archive 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.110
 he had just realized that what was scratching everything was terrible 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.090
 so 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.519
 you can imagine 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:10.779
 completely finished 

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:12.469
 Klaus Reinhard Heinrich 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.149
 to the SR he for his roommates 

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:17.290
 We put them with such small cities 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.109
 together 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:22.969
 and as an energy reserve he covers this construction 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:23.879
 No 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.209
 put 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.599
 for her, that is 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:28.369
 actually native 

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:31.469
 percent in his bed 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.930
 So it is striking that in our hospital most 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.280
 So most of the tests are quite boring also the chainsaw 

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:45.219
 Herne I do not know exactly if it is tradition and the color is white 

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.619
 maybe a piece of symbolism has around 

00:02:47.619 --> 00:02:49.580
 international but correct 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.870
 I'm not going to do that but it's strange that the plan matures here 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.240
 so in the year the color white has spoken of the city if I have now 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:00.670
 Once again, it's a pleasure to demonstrate how to be here in this bed 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.099
 it quite clearly is this luminous white so 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:07.159
 she seems good even without glasses Einstein and then especially compared to 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.579
 Darken your hand now, after all, and rest clearly 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:11.849
 and then 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.269
 you look 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.469
 just as cool as the white sheets get their hallmarks 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:18.509
 from Dr 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.440
 to get in the withdrawal clinic 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.480
 have a very conservative of the referendum policy 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:27.279
 our motto plain text 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:29.029
 if I do not prevent 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:31.189
 Felix himself my bed 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.519
 and we think so too 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.340
 after that 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.239
 after that, do not cure any and no piece 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.629
 it's like it's in my house Sezgin 8 Mining Inc Red Dr 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:47.579
 You can not see me anymore and that's how it is with you 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:50.029
 the space is waiting instead 

00:03:50.029 --> 00:03:51.659
 his 80 1 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.259
 sin 

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:55.829
 I also have to agree today 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.809
 for the time being no doubt 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:58.659
 the angel 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.309
 from 4 in his role on the Saar 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:03.679
 that the Beckhams and persons 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.219
 Whose Tartaglia perpetrate 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.139
 and 8 is 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.950
 There is no libel here 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.499
 fundamentalists 

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:13.789
 as you can see here 

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:15.160
 a merger 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.400
 of three people the 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.699
 She herself likes to come to neat color the corner and a beautiful body 

00:04:21.699 --> 00:04:22.210
 lat 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.210
 but I think copying with it totally revolutionized 

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.539
 in fact 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.849
 the time that it finally car show at 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:33.770
 Percent shows the Marineamt 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.689
 this is a kind of fear opponent 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:39.639
 he said that in Berlin 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:41.229
 not every row 

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:42.440
 therefore works 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.309
 he could but I do not have 

00:04:45.309 --> 00:04:48.879
 and there it is alright unfortunately the signal for Beckham 

00:04:50.099 --> 00:04:53.599
 To clarify the aspects the best car and workers agree 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.820
 At the same time, however, Estonia was the place to go, it just makes you feel easy 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.559
 illuminated 

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:03.719
 Make a decade is very much like 

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:06.729
 in our community aimed at cooperation be at the celebration 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:11.639
 and obscure a terminology and Mendes country about 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:15.020
 in the year that is ours 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:18.919
 our Arthur and ours is expressed that they are not the 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:20.210
 only one though 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:22.460
 a possible 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:24.490
 and with this technique 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.059
 and it seems, of course, is from the well-known name home technology 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.439
 but one has at &amp; s writes that is the absolute of the year 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:37.599
 the span is enough here 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.150
 yes I think it's cool 

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:47.999
 and experts he also knows completely related SpÃ¤th SN everyone likes to 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:51.909
 Soft toys with soft pillows the fluffy bad luck 

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:16.599
 the audience then I should be very enlightening 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.209
 l personally i am a bit disappointed that they are not hired 

00:06:20.209 --> 00:06:23.860
 and other states like Brazil and India will be there until the time has come 

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:25.800
 can not remember anything 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.400
 Adidas want 

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:31.689
 comforting 

00:06:31.689 --> 00:06:34.830
 I believe it is also six months old has matured 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.439
 explodes and now we come to the oldest corrected 

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.499
 Intel calls 

00:06:43.499 --> 00:06:45.599
 So the idea can be gone with it
