because it will sort of see part in the

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.150 
because it will sort of see part in the
sides<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.280> then<00:02:25.030> it<00:02:25.780> will<00:02:25.930> just<00:02:26.110> burst<00:02:26.860> open

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160

over<00:02:32.440> like<00:02:32.709> you're<00:02:32.890> folding<00:02:33.070> it<00:02:33.250> into<00:02:33.550> a

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:33.580 
over like you're folding it into a

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.790 
over like you're folding it into a
triangle<00:02:34.209> so<00:02:34.780> fold<00:02:34.990> it<00:02:35.050> up<00:02:35.170> into<00:02:35.350> the<00:02:35.560> corner

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
triangle so fold it up into the corner

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.070 
triangle so fold it up into the corner
and<00:02:36.240> then<00:02:37.240> give<00:02:38.230> it<00:02:38.260> another<00:02:38.410> fold<00:02:38.920> again<00:02:39.220> into

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
and then give it another fold again into

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.050 
and then give it another fold again into
the<00:02:41.080> other<00:02:41.350> corner<00:02:41.890> so<00:02:42.280> that<00:02:42.310> you've<00:02:42.520> also<00:02:42.730> got

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
the other corner so that you've also got

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.340 
the other corner so that you've also got
a<00:02:44.130> triangle<00:02:45.130> and<00:02:45.280> then<00:02:46.060> if<00:02:46.239> it's<00:02:46.840> quite<00:02:47.110> long

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350 
a triangle and then if it's quite long

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.620 
a triangle and then if it's quite long
to<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:47.890> it<00:02:48.010> one<00:02:48.190> more<00:02:48.400> time<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.910> when<00:02:49.510> that's

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
to do it one more time and when that's

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.949 
to do it one more time and when that's
done<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:50.560> just<00:02:50.800> get<00:02:50.980> some<00:02:51.160> water<00:02:51.420> to<00:02:52.420> seal<00:02:52.750> it

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
done you just get some water to seal it

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.740 
done you just get some water to seal it
at<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.350> edges<00:02:53.739> and<00:02:53.950> just<00:02:54.280> fold<00:02:54.489> it<00:02:54.700> again<00:02:54.850> so

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
at the edges and just fold it again so

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.250 
at the edges and just fold it again so
it's<00:02:55.900> become<00:02:56.260> like<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.470> little<00:02:56.770> parcel<00:02:58.260> there

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
it's become like a little parcel there

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.410 
it's become like a little parcel there
it<00:02:59.380> is<00:02:59.500> so<00:03:00.250> once<00:03:00.459> you've<00:03:00.610> done<00:03:00.790> with<00:03:00.970> that<00:03:01.120> you

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
it is so once you've done with that you

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.190 
it is so once you've done with that you
can<00:03:01.450> flour<00:03:02.250> a<00:03:03.250> tray<00:03:03.880> lay<00:03:04.300> out<00:03:04.420> all<00:03:04.450> the<00:03:04.750> pastry

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
can flour a tray lay out all the pastry

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.900 
can flour a tray lay out all the pastry

I'm just trying to work out which

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.479 
I'm just trying to work out which
position<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:07.660> it<00:03:07.830> gives<00:03:08.830> it<00:03:09.010> each<00:03:09.190> one<00:03:09.459> a

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
position so that it gives it each one a

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:10.229 
position so that it gives it each one a
bit<00:03:09.670> of<00:03:09.790> a<00:03:09.820> run

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239
