milliseconds<00:01:00.200> which<00:01:00.560> is<00:01:00.770> I<00:01:00.980> mean<00:01:01.010> m/s<00:01:01.610> port

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
milliseconds which is I mean m/s port

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:04.179 
milliseconds which is I mean m/s port
and<00:01:02.450> then<00:01:02.570> i'm<00:01:02.690> stacie<00:01:02.960> mara<00:01:03.320> can<00:01:03.650> go<00:01:03.800> all<00:01:04.040> the

00:01:04.179 --> 00:01:04.189 
and then i'm stacie mara can go all the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:07.330

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:09.260 
versus twenty Hertz frequency gaming and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:15.920 
versus twenty Hertz frequency gaming and
Xbox<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:14.310> a<00:02:14.340> 60<00:02:14.880> Hertz<00:02:14.910> monitor<00:02:15.330> will<00:02:15.630> run<00:02:15.810> you

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
Xbox so a 60 Hertz monitor will run you

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.360 
Xbox so a 60 Hertz monitor will run you
about<00:02:16.580> HDMI<00:02:17.580> across<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.150> about<00:02:18.330> 130<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.370> 170

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
about HDMI across you about 130 to 170

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.830 
about HDMI across you about 130 to 170
from<00:02:22.700> 128<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.820> monitor<00:02:24.209> probably<00:02:24.480> jumps<00:02:24.720> to

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
from 128 to monitor probably jumps to

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.420 
from 128 to monitor probably jumps to
about<00:02:25.110> 200<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.180> 340<00:02:27.180> bucks<00:02:27.860> 250<00:02:28.860> bucks

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
about 200 the 340 bucks 250 bucks

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.710 
about 200 the 340 bucks 250 bucks
so<00:02:30.470> so<00:02:31.470> 60<00:02:31.890> Hertz<00:02:32.130> it's<00:02:32.400> only<00:02:32.610> good<00:02:33.060> if<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.510> are

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
so so 60 Hertz it's only good if you are

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.590 
so so 60 Hertz it's only good if you are
on<00:02:34.080> a<00:02:34.140> 60<00:02:34.709> Hertz<00:02:34.739> monitor<00:02:35.190> and<00:02:35.700> you<00:02:36.209> can<00:02:36.360> find

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
on a 60 Hertz monitor and you can find

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.390 
on a 60 Hertz monitor and you can find
that<00:02:36.780> out<00:02:37.019> if<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.260> go<00:02:37.380> your<00:02:37.560> control<00:02:37.950> panel

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
that out if you go your control panel

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.580 
that out if you go your control panel
and<00:02:38.459> stuff<00:02:38.670> like<00:02:38.790> that<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:39.959> if<00:02:40.320> you<00:02:40.380> get

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
and stuff like that so if you get

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.360 
and stuff like that so if you get
anything<00:02:40.860> above<00:02:41.280> 60<00:02:41.580> fps<00:02:42.030> you'll<00:02:42.840> probably

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
anything above 60 fps you'll probably

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.949 
anything above 60 fps you'll probably
get<00:02:44.370> some<00:02:44.430> screen<00:02:45.000> tearing<00:02:45.330> which<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.750> not

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
get some screen tearing which is not

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.949 
get some screen tearing which is not
good<00:02:46.290> hard<00:02:46.410> water<00:02:47.330> pixels<00:02:48.330> will<00:02:48.540> be<00:02:48.570> out<00:02:48.810> of

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
good hard water pixels will be out of

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.580 
good hard water pixels will be out of
place<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:50.269> yeah<00:02:51.269> so<00:02:51.600> that's<00:02:51.810> why<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.290> should

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
place and yeah so that's why you should

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.490 
place and yeah so that's why you should
lock<00:02:52.739> your<00:02:52.860> games<00:02:53.070> at<00:02:53.190> 60<00:02:53.489> fps<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.350> 120<00:02:55.350> here's

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
lock your games at 60 fps and 120 here's

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.120
