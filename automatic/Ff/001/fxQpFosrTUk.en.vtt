are many questions about this but one
question<00:00:45.590> is<00:00:45.920> if<00:00:46.100> you<00:00:46.280> take<00:00:46.520> Genesis<00:00:47.239> in<00:00:47.510> a

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
question is if you take Genesis in a

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.080 
question is if you take Genesis in a
non-literal<00:00:48.829> fashion<00:00:49.520> especially<00:00:49.730> the

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
non-literal fashion especially the

non-literal fashion especially the
creation<00:00:50.480> stories<00:00:51.370> why<00:00:52.370> take<00:00:52.640> anything<00:00:53.030> in

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
creation stories why take anything in

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.420 
creation stories why take anything in
the<00:00:53.480> Bible<00:00:53.840> literally<00:00:54.050> like<00:00:54.380> say<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.950> Gospels

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430

the Bible literally like say the Gospels
do<00:00:56.210> you<00:00:56.300> take<00:00:56.540> the<00:00:56.690> Gospels<00:00:57.110> literally<00:00:57.530> um<00:00:57.920> I

do you take the Gospels literally um I
want<00:00:58.579> to<00:00:58.700> say<00:00:58.910> that<00:00:59.120> the<00:00:59.239> word<00:00:59.540> literal<00:01:00.410> is

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
want to say that the word literal is

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:03.670 
want to say that the word literal is
confusing<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:02.059> word<00:01:02.300> literal<00:01:03.020> like<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:03.500> word

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:03.680 
confusing the word literal like the word

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.980 
confusing the word literal like the word
metaphorical<00:01:04.429> is<00:01:04.609> actually<00:01:05.389> a<00:01:05.420> word<00:01:05.749> which

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
metaphorical is actually a word which

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.709 
metaphorical is actually a word which
refers<00:01:06.439> to<00:01:06.469> the<00:01:07.369> way<00:01:07.579> that<00:01:07.789> words<00:01:08.060> refer<00:01:08.539> to

refers to the way that words refer to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:11.889 
refers to the way that words refer to
things<00:01:08.979> whereas<00:01:09.979> what<00:01:10.189> we<00:01:10.310> often<00:01:10.549> mean<00:01:11.090> is<00:01:11.479> the

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:11.899 
things whereas what we often mean is the

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:13.629 
things whereas what we often mean is the
distinction<00:01:12.590> between<00:01:12.770> concrete<00:01:13.490> and

00:01:13.629 --> 00:01:13.639 
distinction between concrete and

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:15.639 
distinction between concrete and
abstract<00:01:14.109> concrete<00:01:15.109> being<00:01:15.319> something

00:01:15.639 --> 00:01:15.649 
abstract concrete being something

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:18.340

00:01:21.449 --> 00:01:21.459 
being like an idea now you can refer

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:24.370 
being like an idea now you can refer
metaphorically<00:01:22.459> to<00:01:22.789> something<00:01:23.479> concrete<00:01:23.899> if

I call my car the old tin can that's a
metaphorical<00:01:27.409> reference<00:01:27.829> to<00:01:28.310> something<00:01:28.490> it

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
metaphorical reference to something it

is definitely solid or you can refer
literally<00:01:32.359> to<00:01:32.569> something<00:01:32.929> abstract<00:01:33.319> if<00:01:33.649> I<00:01:33.740> say

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
literally to something abstract if I say

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.269 
literally to something abstract if I say
Plato's<00:01:34.520> theory<00:01:35.060> of<00:01:35.179> forms<00:01:35.630> that<00:01:36.130> theory<00:01:37.130> is

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:37.279 
Plato's theory of forms that theory is

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:39.879 
Plato's theory of forms that theory is
itself<00:01:37.670> an<00:01:37.880> abstraction<00:01:38.450> and<00:01:38.810> the<00:01:39.319> forms<00:01:39.679> are

00:01:39.879 --> 00:01:39.889 
itself an abstraction and the forms are

00:01:39.889 --> 00:01:41.499 
itself an abstraction and the forms are
themselves<00:01:40.090> abstracting<00:01:41.090> is<00:01:41.179> doubly

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:41.509 
themselves abstracting is doubly

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:44.169 
themselves abstracting is doubly
abstract<00:01:42.020> but<00:01:42.380> I'm<00:01:42.560> referring<00:01:43.159> literally<00:01:43.909> to

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:44.179 
abstract but I'm referring literally to

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:46.839 
abstract but I'm referring literally to
it<00:01:44.359> so<00:01:44.779> when<00:01:44.990> we<00:01:45.109> say<00:01:45.319> is<00:01:45.560> genesis<00:01:46.069> to<00:01:46.189> be<00:01:46.279> taken

00:01:46.839 --> 00:01:46.849 
it so when we say is genesis to be taken

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:50.409 
it so when we say is genesis to be taken
literally<00:01:47.479> and<00:01:47.719> what<00:01:48.590> i<00:01:48.619> want<00:01:48.829> to<00:01:48.889> say<00:01:49.159> is<00:01:49.429> that

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:50.419 
literally and what i want to say is that

00:01:50.419 --> 00:01:52.149 
literally and what i want to say is that
doesn't<00:01:50.929> settle<00:01:51.200> ahead<00:01:51.560> of<00:01:51.709> time<00:01:51.950> the

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:52.159 
doesn't settle ahead of time the

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:53.830 
doesn't settle ahead of time the
question<00:01:52.399> of<00:01:52.669> what<00:01:52.819> it<00:01:52.939> actually<00:01:53.389> refers<00:01:53.810> to

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
question of what it actually refers to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.529 
question of what it actually refers to
and<00:01:54.380> when<00:01:54.889> we<00:01:55.039> are<00:01:55.159> reading<00:01:55.549> any<00:01:55.789> text<00:01:56.359> it

00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
and when we are reading any text it

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.870 
and when we are reading any text it
ought<00:01:56.779> to<00:01:56.810> be<00:01:56.989> an<00:01:57.139> open<00:01:57.560> question<00:01:57.709> what<00:01:58.549> does

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
ought to be an open question what does

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.479 
ought to be an open question what does
this<00:01:59.090> text<00:01:59.419> intend<00:02:00.020> to<00:02:00.259> refer<00:02:00.560> to<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:00.950> how

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:01.489 
this text intend to refer to and how

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:03.669 
this text intend to refer to and how

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
does it intend to refer to it and

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.159 
does it intend to refer to it and
famously<00:02:04.609> when<00:02:05.270> you<00:02:05.450> read<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:05.810> in<00:02:05.989> the

famously when you read the in the

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:08.469 
famously when you read the in the

Jesus himself tells a parable the point
is<00:02:42.659> not<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.900> this<00:02:43.260> actually<00:02:43.709> happened
