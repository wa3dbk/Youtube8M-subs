all<00:03:02.820> right<00:03:03.410> well<00:03:04.410> it<00:03:04.680> looks<00:03:04.920> like<00:03:05.010> I<00:03:05.340> have<00:03:05.520> a

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:05.550 
all right well it looks like I have a

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:07.460 
all right well it looks like I have a
little<00:03:05.940> bit<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.240> overhead<00:03:06.840> but<00:03:07.080> your<00:03:07.230> defense

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
little bit of overhead but your defense

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.820 
little bit of overhead but your defense
is<00:03:07.950> way<00:03:08.520> up<00:03:08.790> there<00:03:09.060> because<00:03:09.480> all<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:10.140> iron<00:03:10.500> and

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
is way up there because all is iron and

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.650 
is way up there because all is iron and
rock<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.640> guess

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
rock I guess

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.020 
rock I guess
so<00:03:13.530> it's<00:03:13.709> gonna<00:03:13.830> be<00:03:13.920> really<00:03:14.310> hard<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.670> get<00:03:14.850> in

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
so it's gonna be really hard to get in

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.410 
so it's gonna be really hard to get in
