scouts do I really need to explain my
principles<00:00:12.389> yet<00:00:12.749> again

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:23.800 

and<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:22.140> think<00:00:22.199> little<00:00:22.500> dudes<00:00:22.800> get<00:00:23.009> a<00:00:23.039> fighting

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
and I think little dudes get a fighting

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.670 
and I think little dudes get a fighting
power<00:00:24.810> -<00:00:25.110> a<00:00:26.300> good<00:00:27.300> way<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> taking<00:00:28.140> out<00:00:28.380> ships

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
power - a good way of taking out ships

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
that are faze cloaked is doing something

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.850 
that are faze cloaked is doing something
like<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:32.390> probably<00:00:33.390> inefficient<00:00:33.989> it<00:00:34.170> did<00:00:34.350> 24

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
like this probably inefficient it did 24

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.500 
like this probably inefficient it did 24
damage<00:00:35.100> but

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.330

close<00:00:48.640> that<00:00:48.910> up<00:00:49.150> attack<00:00:49.630> Antares<00:00:50.350> that<00:00:50.620> should

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:50.830 
close that up attack Antares that should

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.829 
close that up attack Antares that should
be<00:00:50.980> enough

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839 
be enough

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.009 

you've<00:01:00.309> seen

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.100 

so<00:01:05.619> important<00:01:06.189> note<00:01:06.310> I<00:01:06.490> have<00:01:06.700> taken<00:01:07.060> Terry<00:01:07.899> is

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
so important note I have taken Terry is

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.020 
so important note I have taken Terry is
the<00:01:08.350> smallest<00:01:08.680> Ford<00:01:09.040> of<00:01:09.159> course<00:01:09.670> I've<00:01:09.880> ever

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
the smallest Ford of course I've ever

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:15.630 
the smallest Ford of course I've ever
pulled<00:01:10.329> it<00:01:10.420> off<00:01:10.540> with<00:01:13.290> but<00:01:14.290> I<00:01:14.710> pretty<00:01:15.159> much<00:01:15.280> bet

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
pulled it off with but I pretty much bet

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.280 
pulled it off with but I pretty much bet
the<00:01:15.820> crews<00:01:16.119> are<00:01:16.240> specifically<00:01:16.720> for<00:01:16.990> attacking

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
the crews are specifically for attacking

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.320 
the crews are specifically for attacking
Antares<00:01:18.039> phase<00:01:18.460> and<00:01:18.670> cloak<00:01:18.880> time<00:01:19.149> or

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
Antares phase and cloak time or

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.060 
Antares phase and cloak time or
facilitator<00:01:19.960> all<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.380> cheap<00:01:20.560> stuff<00:01:20.829> you

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
facilitator all the cheap stuff you

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.499 
facilitator all the cheap stuff you
could<00:01:21.220> probably<00:01:23.939> just<00:01:24.939> be<00:01:25.090> a<00:01:25.119> degree<00:01:25.330> of

00:01:25.499 --> 00:01:25.509 
could probably just be a degree of

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.609 
could probably just be a degree of
patience<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:28.720> don't<00:01:28.929> have<00:01:29.080> automated

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
patience they don't have automated

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:40.020 
patience they don't have automated
repair<00:01:29.920> units<00:01:38.459> coupled<00:01:39.459> with<00:01:39.490> a<00:01:39.670> couple<00:01:39.940> other

repair units coupled with a couple other

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:44.999 
repair units coupled with a couple other
technologies<00:01:41.159> there's<00:01:42.159> fruit<00:01:43.860> how<00:01:44.860> do<00:01:44.920> you

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
technologies there's fruit how do you

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:51.670 
technologies there's fruit how do you
feel<00:01:45.190> this<00:01:45.399> battle<00:01:45.880> system<00:01:46.209> is<00:01:46.360> much<00:01:46.600> more

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.910 

all<00:01:51.830> right<00:01:53.350> fire<00:01:54.350> power<00:01:54.560> lifting<00:01:56.740> I'd<00:01:57.740> be

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
all right fire power lifting I'd be

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.620 
all right fire power lifting I'd be
interested<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.430> see<00:01:58.670> if<00:01:58.760> the<00:01:58.910> bull<00:01:59.090> Raffy

00:01:59.620 --> 00:01:59.630 
interested to see if the bull Raffy

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.570 
interested to see if the bull Raffy
would<00:01:59.840> be<00:01:59.990> able<00:02:00.230> to<00:02:00.440> you<00:02:01.430> know<00:02:01.550> use

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
would be able to you know use

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.280 
would be able to you know use
transporters<00:02:02.450> to<00:02:02.570> really<00:02:02.750> take<00:02:02.930> this<00:02:03.050> place

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
transporters to really take this place

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.340 
transporters to really take this place
down<00:02:03.500> they<00:02:03.770> have<00:02:03.860> a<00:02:03.920> huge<00:02:05.020> ground<00:02:06.020> combat

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
down they have a huge ground combat

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.499 
down they have a huge ground combat
books<00:02:06.770> they've<00:02:07.220> got<00:02:07.430> all<00:02:07.670> the<00:02:07.820> technology<00:02:08.000> I

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
books they've got all the technology I

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.180 
books they've got all the technology I
think<00:02:08.570> we<00:02:09.320> need<00:02:09.649> a<00:02:09.800> leader<00:02:10.240> but<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.830> know<00:02:12.830> the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190 
think we need a leader but you know the

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:22.810 
think we need a leader but you know the
bull<00:02:13.340> Raffy<00:02:13.700> could<00:02:13.880> have<00:02:14.030> that<00:02:14.270> too<00:02:14.510> so<00:02:21.520> but<00:02:22.520> I

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
bull Raffy could have that too so but I

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:26.680 
bull Raffy could have that too so but I
would<00:02:23.000> be<00:02:23.120> interested<00:02:24.940> one<00:02:25.940> other<00:02:26.120> fun<00:02:26.420> thing

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
would be interested one other fun thing

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.180 
would be interested one other fun thing
if<00:02:26.959> you<00:02:27.110> really<00:02:27.470> want<00:02:27.650> to<00:02:27.740> gauge<00:02:27.980> the

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
if you really want to gauge the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.710 
if you really want to gauge the
effectiveness<00:02:28.640> of<00:02:29.000> different<00:02:29.060> types<00:02:29.540> of

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
effectiveness of different types of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.560 
effectiveness of different types of
weapons<00:02:30.050> against<00:02:30.500> a<00:02:30.950> generic<00:02:31.640> damage<00:02:32.090> single

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
weapons against a generic damage single

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.600 
weapons against a generic damage single
Antares<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.620> a<00:02:33.650> great<00:02:33.950> thing<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.280> experiment

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
Antares is a great thing to experiment

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.690 
Antares is a great thing to experiment
on<00:02:34.970> because<00:02:35.680> this<00:02:36.680> statement<00:02:36.980> of<00:02:37.250> damage

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
on because this statement of damage

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.940 
on because this statement of damage
14:43<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:41.030> that's<00:02:41.150> pretty<00:02:41.390> good<00:02:41.959> it's<00:02:42.530> faster

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
14:43 and that's pretty good it's faster

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.890 
14:43 and that's pretty good it's faster
than<00:02:43.070> doing<00:02:43.190> the<00:02:43.400> math<00:02:43.580> yourself

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.809 

I've<00:02:48.440> uh<00:02:48.590> loaded<00:02:48.890> up<00:02:49.099> with<00:02:49.489> a<00:02:49.549> bunch<00:02:49.730> of

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
I've uh loaded up with a bunch of

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.309 
I've uh loaded up with a bunch of
stellar<00:02:50.030> converts<00:02:50.569> just<00:02:50.659> to<00:02:50.900> see<00:02:51.080> what<00:02:51.200> would

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
stellar converts just to see what would

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.850 
stellar converts just to see what would
happen

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
happen

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.699 
happen
yeah<00:02:52.190> it's<00:02:52.700> a<00:02:52.819> big<00:02:53.000> number<00:02:53.290> anyway<00:02:54.290> we'll<00:02:54.530> call

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
yeah it's a big number anyway we'll call

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.649 
yeah it's a big number anyway we'll call
it<00:02:54.799> here<00:02:55.040> check<00:02:55.700> the<00:02:55.849> volume<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.510> it's

00:02:56.649 --> 00:02:56.659 
it here check the volume so it's

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:59.050 
it here check the volume so it's
reasonable<00:02:57.110> and<00:02:57.349> then<00:02:57.470> watch<00:02:57.980> the<00:02:58.310> end<00:02:58.459> again

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
reasonable and then watch the end again

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:31.610 
reasonable and then watch the end again
I<00:02:59.090> guess

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.130 

the<00:03:32.620> power<00:03:32.950> of<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.730> Ancients<00:03:34.450> is<00:03:34.599> now<00:03:34.780> yours

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
the power of the Ancients is now yours

and just see how high a score you can

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.420 
and just see how high a score you can
get<00:04:42.980> because<00:04:43.550> you<00:04:44.210> can<00:04:44.420> multiply<00:04:45.140> it<00:04:45.350> by<00:04:45.770> three

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430

twenty<00:04:46.790> four<00:04:47.150> at<00:04:47.420> the<00:04:47.600> end<00:04:47.630> which<00:04:47.900> would<00:04:48.020> put

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:48.320 
twenty four at the end which would put

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.200 
twenty four at the end which would put
even<00:04:48.650> this<00:04:48.860> up<00:04:48.920> into<00:04:49.310> the<00:04:50.500> almost<00:04:51.500> 7,000

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210

even this up into the almost 7,000
anyway<00:04:54.020> maybe<00:04:54.710> you<00:04:54.949> want<00:04:55.160> to<00:04:55.190> try<00:04:55.400> that<00:04:55.430> I<00:04:55.699> for

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
anyway maybe you want to try that I for

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.540 
anyway maybe you want to try that I for
one<00:04:56.360> about<00:04:56.570> a<00:04:56.630> lot<00:04:56.960> of<00:04:56.990> Master<00:04:57.560> of<00:04:57.590> Orion<00:04:57.800> -<00:04:58.310> and

one about a lot of Master of Orion - and

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.930 
one about a lot of Master of Orion - and
I<00:04:58.639> need<00:04:58.699> a<00:04:58.820> break<00:04:59.380> but<00:05:00.380> it's<00:05:00.500> been<00:05:00.680> good<00:05:00.910> so<00:05:01.910> I

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:01.940 
I need a break but it's been good so I

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.680 
I need a break but it's been good so I
hope<00:05:02.180> this<00:05:02.419> was<00:05:02.630> a<00:05:02.660> bit<00:05:03.470> a<00:05:03.710> good<00:05:04.690> alternative

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690

one and I enjoy discovering the strategy

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.879 
one and I enjoy discovering the strategy
a<00:05:13.789> lot<00:05:14.090> because<00:05:15.050> like<00:05:15.289> I<00:05:15.410> said<00:05:15.620> at<00:05:15.770> the

00:05:15.879 --> 00:05:15.889 
a lot because like I said at the

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:18.640 
a lot because like I said at the
beginning<00:05:16.009> I'd<00:05:16.430> never<00:05:16.699> used<00:05:17.530> unification<00:05:18.530> as

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
beginning I'd never used unification as

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:19.850 
a government tape before because I

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.430 
a government tape before because I
couldn't<00:05:20.120> imagine<00:05:20.240> them<00:05:20.750> having<00:05:20.810> morale

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
couldn't imagine them having morale

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.360 
couldn't imagine them having morale
bonuses<00:05:21.979> but<00:05:22.190> I<00:05:22.250> really<00:05:22.699> liked<00:05:22.910> the<00:05:23.030> result

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
bonuses but I really liked the result
