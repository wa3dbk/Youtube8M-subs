 which comes in the form of skewers 

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.640

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.949

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.779

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.000
 carrot tagliatelle right now 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.410
 the ingredients for the recipe for 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.210
 realize this recipe you will need 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.710
 grass freshly here I took some 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.379
 parsley you can also take from 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:37.860
 coriander shallots a little garlic 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:39.510
 1 lime cranberries or you and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.199
 take grapes from the blond grapes 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.329
 some dried raisins 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.820
 here I need carrots legally 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.540
 4.5 carrot a little olive oil a 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.070
 little flour from the chicken breasts though 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:51.660
 you can ask your butcher 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.530
 who wanted it will be even better 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.680
 and finally so a little bit of this soy from the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.010
 brown sugar and spices therefore here 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.930
 so berries of oregano paprika and 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.309
 of the qr step we will realize some 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.890
 chicken dumplings so to do this 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.090
 so ideally ask your butcher 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.399
 who are you worth 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.390
 your your chicken breasts otherwise you 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:16.259
 cut them into pieces and we go 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:20.369
 switch to the mixer so now I'm going 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.289
 h and secular with parsley and 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.009
 shallots so the shallots jelly close 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:25.009
 also cuts 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.450
 and finally so the percier I take the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.440
 half of my curly so there he is 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.410
 enough he is clean 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:46.030
 I cut a little coarsely 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.060
 leaves here during the bubble and stalk 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:56.110
 is the same so I add it here all 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:57.700
 in my mill with art is now 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.920
 so here I have my chopped chicken I'm going 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:04.030
 add everything I just grind 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:09.100
 so parsley with shallots and 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:14.020
 garlic has become a kind of dough 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:19.650
 aromatic nice well here I add 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.650
 also the cranberries 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:35.940
 I m a little round of paprika pepper 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:39.270
 my heart not too much because here's a 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:46.610
 little bit is perfect a little bit 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.610
 from oregano 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.860
 and finally to tie an egg of course 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.490
 full 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:11.560
 so here we go we start an email to 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:13.720
 mix with the fingers then the little 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.110
 trick to recover all the juice from 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.490
 lemon 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.200
 you switch it to the microphone 10 seconds 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.240
 ok and then he'll make it even more 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.940
 of view that usually so there I 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:29.110
 understand that I'm going to squeeze 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:33.310
 quietly in the chicken and 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:34.720
 recover a maximum of judge so the 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.190
 next step is pretty simple we 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.400
 let's go make our chicken meatballs 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.010
 so what I'm doing here I add a little 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.380
 flour therefore the equivalent of 3 good 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.960
 rounded teaspoon in my 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:47.710
 preparation and then to you mix 

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:50.530
 with your fingertips 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.240
 okay well you want the dough and it 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.750
 allows you to make pretty balls 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.750
 chicken 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.560
 so here I am shaping the 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.500
 little balls to two hens and so I 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.970
 simply take a little bit of 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.260
 prepared chicken meat 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.030
 you want that a little bit in the 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.010
 flour it does not stick to the fingers and 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.540
 then you shape your job yourself 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.540
 put it aside and go 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.180
 to make the tagliatelle of 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.760
 carrot it's very simple once 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.320
 you peeled your carrot at a 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:36.690
 other thrifty you just come 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:38.490
 make slats that's like this so 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:40.889
 in a hot pan with a small 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.630
 oil background you add your meatballs 

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:43.680
 of chicken we will make them brown five 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.060
 minutes while turning them over 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.669
 delicately so that they are golden 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:49.669
 that all sides are 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.180
 that's after five minutes dumplings 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.509
 of chicken are golden brown so wanted 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.509
 book 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:09.169
 that's it and we're just going to do the 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:11.380
 icing with soy sauce so in 

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:17.479
 your stove will keep you the same 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:21.620
 you add brown sugar valleys 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:24.139
 is a little bit of fire here is a single 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.970
 brown sugar that starts 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.410
 immediately to caramelize and have 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.190
 ice cream right away so with our 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:30.190
 soya sauce 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:49.460
 this is going to make it a caramel jump 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:56.430
 in which we will come back so drenched to 

00:05:53.250 --> 00:06:01.080
 new our chicken balls and well 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.490
 coat them with this mixture so here 

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.180
 it's too thick you can add a 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.180
 little bit of water 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.610
 that's the result we're going to see it's 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.680
 a pretty patty two chickens lake and 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:30.539
 so with a nice golden color like 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:33.210
 that then the carrots I do them 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:35.940
 come back here fsu and in a little bit of 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:42.349
 butter here in a big few bock 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.349
 minutes later I add a little water 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.970
 I cover and I let them cook for 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.990
 two three minutes steaming like that 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.700
 to make your skewers all 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:58.050
 simply you take the slats of 

00:06:54.700 --> 00:07:00.310
 carrots wanted to roll on itself 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:07.990
 like these so do you in 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:09.640

 the parsley won a nice touch of 

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:31.260
 green and fresh and finally another 

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:34.000
