amazingly blue this water is awesome so
here's<00:01:46.070> the<00:01:46.220> channel<00:01:47.140> between<00:01:48.140> the<00:01:48.320> two

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
here's the channel between the two

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.400 
here's the channel between the two
sections<00:01:49.070> of<00:01:49.310> the<00:01:49.430> island<00:01:52.990> the<00:01:53.990> wind<00:01:54.229> is

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
sections of the island the wind is

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:59.910 
sections of the island the wind is
willing<00:01:54.740> me<00:01:54.830> pretty<00:01:56.020> hard<00:01:57.020> in<00:01:57.290> that<00:01:57.410> direction

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.770 

it's<00:02:00.920> gonna<00:02:01.010> be<00:02:01.190> kind<00:02:01.430> of<00:02:01.490> interesting<00:02:01.940> coming

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
it's gonna be kind of interesting coming

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.590 
it's gonna be kind of interesting coming
back<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.200> little<00:02:03.710> bit<00:02:03.800> tougher<00:02:04.100> but<00:02:04.600> anyway

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
back a little bit tougher but anyway

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.540 
back a little bit tougher but anyway
pretty<00:02:06.470> cool<00:02:08.890> so<00:02:09.890> I'm<00:02:10.009> now<00:02:10.160> through<00:02:10.429> the

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
pretty cool so I'm now through the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.130 
pretty cool so I'm now through the
channel<00:02:10.940> check<00:02:11.150> it<00:02:11.300> out<00:02:11.420> you<00:02:11.630> can<00:02:11.750> see<00:02:11.959> that

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
channel check it out you can see that

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.860 
channel check it out you can see that
water<00:02:12.640> moving<00:02:13.640> along<00:02:13.910> very<00:02:13.940> quickly<00:02:14.360> so

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
water moving along very quickly so

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.300 
water moving along very quickly so
obviously<00:02:15.320> it<00:02:15.440> wasn't<00:02:15.590> just<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.980> wind

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
obviously it wasn't just the wind

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.970 
obviously it wasn't just the wind
pushing<00:02:16.730> me<00:02:16.850> but<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.150> currents<00:02:18.020> there<00:02:18.200> so<00:02:18.920> I'm

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:18.980 
pushing me but the currents there so I'm

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.800 
pushing me but the currents there so I'm
gonna<00:02:19.100> have<00:02:19.250> to<00:02:19.430> paddle<00:02:19.910> back<00:02:20.060> up<00:02:20.360> through

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
gonna have to paddle back up through

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.560 
gonna have to paddle back up through
that<00:02:21.550> it's<00:02:22.550> not<00:02:22.700> that<00:02:22.880> bad<00:02:23.060> though<00:02:23.240> it'll<00:02:23.450> work

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
that it's not that bad though it'll work

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
that it's not that bad though it'll work
out<00:02:23.720> but<00:02:23.959> I'm<00:02:24.190> gonna<00:02:25.190> be<00:02:25.430> the<00:02:26.209> most<00:02:26.390> sore<00:02:26.720> when

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
out but I'm gonna be the most sore when

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.949 
out but I'm gonna be the most sore when
I'm<00:02:27.680> heading<00:02:27.830> back<00:02:27.950> so<00:02:28.340> that'll<00:02:28.550> be<00:02:28.640> a<00:02:28.670> little

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
I'm heading back so that'll be a little

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.229 
I'm heading back so that'll be a little
little<00:02:29.959> challenging<00:02:30.380> this<00:02:31.000> anyway<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.060> you

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
little challenging this anyway so you

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.930 
little challenging this anyway so you
can<00:02:32.270> see<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.660> is<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.900> more<00:02:33.080> populated<00:02:33.940> or

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
can see that is the more populated or

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.790 
can see that is the more populated or
the<00:02:35.150> populated<00:02:35.780> side<00:02:36.230> of<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.410> island<00:02:36.680> and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
the populated side of the island and

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.800 
the populated side of the island and
then<00:02:37.340> over<00:02:37.550> here<00:02:37.580> is<00:02:37.940> the<00:02:38.000> more<00:02:38.239> remote<00:02:38.570> side

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
then over here is the more remote side

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.120 
then over here is the more remote side
island<00:02:39.200> although<00:02:39.320> there<00:02:39.560> are<00:02:39.680> a<00:02:39.709> couple<00:02:39.950> of

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
island although there are a couple of

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.830 
island although there are a couple of
buildings<00:02:40.459> there<00:02:42.790> so<00:02:43.790> I'm<00:02:43.910> gonna<00:02:44.090> scoot<00:02:44.510> on<00:02:44.660> up

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
buildings there so I'm gonna scoot on up

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.160 
buildings there so I'm gonna scoot on up
this<00:02:45.560> way<00:02:46.030> since<00:02:47.030> there's<00:02:47.239> less<00:02:47.540> people<00:02:47.989> and<00:02:48.140> I

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
this way since there's less people and I

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.800 
this way since there's less people and I
haven't<00:02:48.350> seen<00:02:49.190> any<00:02:49.340> of<00:02:49.370> it<00:02:49.459> yet<00:02:49.660> see<00:02:50.660> what<00:02:50.690> I

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.380 

and<00:03:04.019> these<00:03:04.920> waters<00:03:05.430> are<00:03:05.609> looking<00:03:06.000> very<00:03:06.030> very

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
and these waters are looking very very

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:13.030 
and these waters are looking very very
inviting

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.589 

what<00:03:14.040> a<00:03:14.069> cool<00:03:14.400> scene<00:03:14.730> fun<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.209> get<00:03:15.299> out<00:03:15.359> on<00:03:15.540> the

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
what a cool scene fun to get out on the

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:22.099 
what a cool scene fun to get out on the
water<00:03:15.629> here<00:03:16.019> I<00:03:20.569> would<00:03:21.569> not<00:03:21.750> be<00:03:21.900> at<00:03:21.989> all

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:22.109 
water here I would not be at all

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:23.660 
water here I would not be at all
surprised<00:03:22.530> if<00:03:22.829> there<00:03:23.010> were<00:03:23.099> some<00:03:23.250> crocodiles

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
surprised if there were some crocodiles

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.720 
surprised if there were some crocodiles
around<00:03:24.000> here

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.229 

definitely<00:03:29.730> looks<00:03:29.849> like<00:03:29.970> a<00:03:30.000> nice

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
definitely looks like a nice

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.149 
definitely looks like a nice
neighborhood<00:03:31.489> for<00:03:32.489> them<00:03:33.620> good<00:03:34.620> spot<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.010> hide

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 
neighborhood for them good spot to hide

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.860 
neighborhood for them good spot to hide
out<00:03:35.340> in<00:03:35.370> these<00:03:36.379> swamps<00:03:37.379> and<00:03:37.680> mangroves<00:03:38.099> here

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
out in these swamps and mangroves here

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.449 
out in these swamps and mangroves here
there's<00:03:39.870> a<00:03:39.989> street<00:03:40.439> in<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.739> town<00:03:40.920> called

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
there's a street in the town called

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:43.940 
there's a street in the town called
crocodile<00:03:42.000> Street<00:03:42.390> I<00:03:42.680> don't<00:03:43.680> know<00:03:43.739> for

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
crocodile Street I don't know for

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.199 
crocodile Street I don't know for
certain<00:03:44.189> the<00:03:44.250> Darracq<00:03:44.489> lock<00:03:44.609> allows<00:03:44.819> her<00:03:45.000> but

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
certain the Darracq lock allows her but

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.940 
certain the Darracq lock allows her but
I<00:03:45.450> believe<00:03:46.319> so

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
I believe so

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.530 
I believe so
so<00:03:47.879> I<00:03:47.909> probably<00:03:48.180> won't<00:03:48.329> swim<00:03:48.569> here<00:03:53.239> all<00:03:54.239> right

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
so I probably won't swim here all right

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:02.520 
so I probably won't swim here all right
coming<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.019> a<00:03:55.049> nice<00:03:55.290> little<00:03:55.470> bay<00:03:55.680> here
