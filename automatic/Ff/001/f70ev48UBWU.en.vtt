00:00:08.739 --> 00:00:12.649
 fiqas aalsmeer the number two in the handball lords the vision plays tonight 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:14.679
 against the number three 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:17.679
 and that is positive but in sittard borrowing 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:20.779
 although its particularly risky 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.779
 put this place number two in the rankings tonight 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.280
 can strengthen this position more 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.759
 or have to share that place with the limburgers 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.260
 Aalsmeer in the attack and already points the match with a friend of Robin 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.260
 tree cutter 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.300
 thrown in by Feyenoord Stefanovich a good start to the game m good 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.150
 for self-confidence 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.970
 fiqas and under the all but the limburgers actually do not know this well 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.390
 Outside 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.430
 the goal is from remco van dam de 5 2 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.070
 fiqas swedish wife dad to build a head start and put nice in the 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.130
 contest 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:03.170
 also here a hundred before but the aalsmeer coverage stands like a house 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.229
 but because once clearly lag behind in the scoring 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.490
 when the game threatens 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.250
 and then it's where I live 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.260
 put the lead on no less than 4 6 points in the sixteenth minute 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.200
 but then it goes a little less fiqas the least a number of chances comes in the bottom 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.329
 and the set of joris beard from the majeski can be site for at least 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.360
 four points in a row 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.990
 and so brings the limburgers back into the game with a difference of still 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.310
 only two points 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.090
 always good for points exciting match this handball topper 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.330
 Robin Tree Cutter 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:45.040
 well the government is good but manages to score just before the rest 12 8 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.360
 fiqas aalsmeer and the limburg blazing 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.720
 recent duels were settled in favor of the limburgers 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.760
 but this time it may turn out to be a different story 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.550
 the limburgers come in this competition despite all the good ones 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.730
 no further than a 4 five goals deficit 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.540
 all nice goal from ito steins nicely unlocked from the circle 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.530
 the score at 17 13 in the fourteenth minute of the second half 

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:20.680
 limburg lights are getting ready for the final phase of the competition because there 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.169
 must something really happen now 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:25.639
 Nice rescue from Julie Schenk 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.069
 place under the bar with the climber 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.019
 tampere hectic phase of the match went right on they are played 

00:02:33.669 --> 00:02:37.639
 communication being on the limburgers side we have clearly increased 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.569
 after the violation on zoom more go away and 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.849
 but the referee trio waves van dijk thinks it is all nonsense and 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:46.349
 want 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.639
 just play on 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:51.449
 much comment from the audience 

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:53.269
 another violation 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:56.649
 both times two minutes for the ipo steins and so 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.299
 to violations next time 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.920
 fortunately get his study two minutes 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.119
 and a even meter for aalsmeer 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:11.069
 according to the fanc lubotsky in a second attempt the score stayed on 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.869
 22 15 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:16.999
 a big lead for fiqas aalsmeer of seven points 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:20.199
 ball was stopped by pro3 by entering 

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:23.199
 and a break with a fantastic goal for Robin Boomhouwer 

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:27.400
 fiqas aalsmeer is running out of it is actually not a moment 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.270
 been in danger this match only stood ahead 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:36.819
 one and a half minutes left on the clock and loss of ball at the Limburg lights 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.320
 stijn between a lick of stijn 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.069
 Robin Tree Cutter 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:43.389
 runs away with remko van dam 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:46.479
 but will then make half himself robin boomhouwer 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:48.550
 4 the goal with the audience 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.870
 meanwhile fiqas aalsmeer that this competition will win dick 

00:03:53.749 --> 00:03:57.229
 last moment of the competition is for the foxes movie here 

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:59.029
 walk through the circle 

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:02.029
 gets the ball made the last goal of the match 

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:06.089
 the cabinet does not know how this can happen 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:09.760
 I care because the points are in the class 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.059
 fiqas aalsmeer 

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:13.909
 Twenty convincing of the procession blazing 

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:15.739
 be a resounding nature 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:18.669
 strong defense an effective attack 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:21.909
 fiqas aalsmeer and wind with the 26 17 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.990
 a deserved win 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.509
 and a certain advance 

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:30.099
 think you just become very exciting set because for years against la janssen normal 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.469
 that is true 

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:35.110
 if you look at la jensen d tol one of the most scoring team in the 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.860
 Eredivisie but house on seventeen goals and that is what I say 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.750
 Defending the game inside we were standing as a house we went on 

00:04:42.749 --> 00:04:47.499
 right moments from arenda grabbed when the profit went today was the profit with us 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:51.159
 very clear and euro struggling with it for the rest is completely different 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:53.240
 but is nice and included 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.470
 but yes year where the me 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.639
 too much has to happen 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:04:59.389
 and we started a lot 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.759
 finds a whole competition westende very good idea 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:05.860
 in addition, it wants the number of loans 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.279
 yes in the 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:08.560
 no chance to the 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.050
 opponent a given hence those guys very very well 

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:14.180
 but not like that 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.559
 stay there by trade 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:18.439
 I always have to keep track of the points
