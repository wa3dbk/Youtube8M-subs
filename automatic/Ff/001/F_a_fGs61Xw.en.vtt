hon<00:00:45.870> we're<00:00:46.290> really<00:00:46.680> moved<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.780> stick<00:00:48.780> of<00:00:48.899> truth

considering<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.780> source<00:00:51.930> material<00:00:52.140> I<00:00:52.620> can't

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
think of many ways in which it could be

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.990

improved<00:00:54.770> it<00:00:55.770> looks<00:00:55.950> beautifully<00:00:56.460> crappy<00:00:56.850> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
improved it looks beautifully crappy and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000 
improved it looks beautifully crappy and
may<00:00:57.539> well<00:00:57.719> be<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.899> first<00:00:58.260> game<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.590> history<00:00:58.739> in
