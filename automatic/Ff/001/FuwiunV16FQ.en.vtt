00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
want to get to a point like very it

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.250 
want to get to a point like very it
would<00:00:49.110> be<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:50.219> was<00:00:50.340> Robert<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> certain

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260 
would be it was Robert of a certain

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.439 
would be it was Robert of a certain
tension<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.440> urgency<00:00:53.039> so<00:00:53.070> yeah<00:00:53.850> I<00:00:53.879> think

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
tension and urgency so yeah I think

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.150 
tension and urgency so yeah I think
because<00:00:54.930> seriously<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.469> important<00:00:55.829> for<00:00:56.070> the

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
because seriously it's important for the

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.880 
because seriously it's important for the
writers<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.520> try<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.210> maintain<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.410> it's<00:00:58.680> it's

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
writers to try to maintain and it's it's

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.349 
writers to try to maintain and it's it's
a<00:00:58.980> hard<00:00:59.129> thing<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.520> do<00:00:59.640> over<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> period<00:01:00.329> of

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
a hard thing to do over the period of

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.429 
a hard thing to do over the period of
seasons<00:01:01.730> to<00:01:02.730> maintain<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> sense<00:01:04.170> of<00:01:04.290> the

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
seasons to maintain a sense of the

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.230 
seasons to maintain a sense of the
edginess<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:06.080> not<00:01:07.080> fully<00:01:07.530> trusting<00:01:08.240> but

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
edginess and not fully trusting but

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.760 
edginess and not fully trusting but
between<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.750> characters<00:01:10.170> it's<00:01:10.500> really<00:01:10.740> a

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
between the characters it's really a

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.890 
between the characters it's really a
cast<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.220> lost<00:01:11.729> souls<00:01:12.030> when<00:01:12.390> you're<00:01:12.540> when<00:01:12.780> you
