I'm done with the bones Wow and then
they<00:01:08.690> get<00:01:08.810> to<00:01:08.930> the<00:01:09.020> muscular<00:01:09.290> system<00:01:09.440> and<00:01:09.950> they

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
they get to the muscular system and they

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:13.270 
they get to the muscular system and they
go<00:01:10.220> oh<00:01:10.460> I<00:01:11.360> miss<00:01:11.960> the<00:01:12.170> skeletal<00:01:12.829> system

I<00:01:23.930> actually<00:01:24.170> will<00:01:24.560> narrow<00:01:24.799> down<00:01:24.890> the<00:01:25.130> list

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
I actually will narrow down the list

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.459 
I actually will narrow down the list
quite<00:01:25.610> a<00:01:25.640> bit<00:01:25.939> to<00:01:26.479> the<00:01:26.600> muscles<00:01:26.990> that<00:01:27.079> most

muscles are pretty cool the functions of
the<00:01:53.390> muscle<00:01:53.780> are<00:01:53.929> to<00:01:54.170> provide<00:01:54.500> movement<00:01:55.310> both

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
the muscle are to provide movement both

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.490 
the muscle are to provide movement both
internal<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.509> external<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:58.000> extra<00:01:59.000> movement

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
internal and external so extra movement

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.260 
internal and external so extra movement

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
swallowing their internal movement I

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.800 
swallowing their internal movement I
have<00:02:17.959> movement<00:02:18.290> inside<00:02:18.950> my<00:02:19.190> body<00:02:19.400> okay<00:02:20.390> so

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
have movement inside my body okay so

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.119 
have movement inside my body okay so
that's

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
that's

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.160 
that's
that's<00:02:22.760> going<00:02:22.970> on<00:02:23.120> with<00:02:23.299> skeletal<00:02:23.780> system<00:02:24.019> the

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
that's going on with skeletal system the

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.960 
that's going on with skeletal system the
next<00:02:24.319> one<00:02:24.470> we<00:02:24.530> have<00:02:24.560> is<00:02:24.739> stabilizing<00:02:25.489> the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
next one we have is stabilizing the

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.509 
next one we have is stabilizing the

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 
joint previous videos you took a look at

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:30.460 
joint previous videos you took a look at
the<00:02:28.579> joint<00:02:28.819> for<00:02:29.000> example<00:02:29.450> this<00:02:29.959> joint<00:02:30.319> the

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
the joint for example this joint the

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.670 
the joint for example this joint the
glenohumeral<00:02:30.709> joint<00:02:31.280> the<00:02:31.640> shoulder<00:02:32.209> joint<00:02:32.720> we

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
glenohumeral joint the shoulder joint we

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.710 
glenohumeral joint the shoulder joint we
have<00:02:33.980> a<00:02:34.310> group<00:02:34.849> of<00:02:35.000> muscles<00:02:35.180> called<00:02:35.569> the

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
have a group of muscles called the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.080 
have a group of muscles called the
rotator<00:02:36.170> cuff<00:02:36.260> muscles<00:02:36.950> thus<00:02:37.189> it<00:02:37.459> super<00:02:37.849> spin

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
rotator cuff muscles thus it super spin

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:39.379 
is infraspinatus teres minor

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.589 
is infraspinatus teres minor
subscapularis<00:02:40.129> don't<00:02:40.760> worry<00:02:40.970> we'll<00:02:41.209> cover<00:02:41.420> it

subscapularis don't worry we'll cover it

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.140 
subscapularis don't worry we'll cover it
later<00:02:41.810> but<00:02:42.590> this<00:02:42.859> grouping<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.489> muscles<00:02:44.000> the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
you're a baseball fan when they pitch

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.179 
you're a baseball fan when they pitch
the<00:02:51.769> ball

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:52.189 
the ball

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.460

that's<00:02:52.579> the<00:02:52.939> muscles<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.989> they're<00:02:54.200> using

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
that's the muscles that they're using

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.500 
that's the muscles that they're using
against<00:02:54.920> the<00:02:55.069> rotator<00:02:55.489> cuff<00:02:55.730> muscles<00:02:56.150> I<00:02:56.269> know

against the rotator cuff muscles I know
I'm<00:02:56.629> oversimplifying<00:02:56.989> this<00:02:57.530> if<00:02:57.650> your<00:02:57.799> anatomy

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
I'm oversimplifying this if your anatomy

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:59.559 
I'm oversimplifying this if your anatomy
professor<00:02:58.190> out<00:02:58.609> there<00:02:58.819> but<00:02:59.060> you've<00:02:59.299> learned

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
professor out there but you've learned

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.809 
professor out there but you've learned
somewhere<00:03:00.079> to<00:03:00.290> turn<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.489> stabilizes

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:01.819 
somewhere to turn it so it stabilizes

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.710 
somewhere to turn it so it stabilizes
the<00:03:02.599> joint<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.560> will<00:03:03.799> maintain<00:03:04.310> posture<00:03:05.209> okay

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
the joint it will maintain posture okay

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.240 
the joint it will maintain posture okay
if<00:03:05.840> you<00:03:05.959> remember<00:03:06.260> your<00:03:06.590> childhood<00:03:06.620> your

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
if you remember your childhood your

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.649 
if you remember your childhood your
parents<00:03:07.639> told<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:07.879> sit<00:03:08.120> up<00:03:08.209> straight<00:03:08.480> don't

00:03:08.649 --> 00:03:08.659 
parents told you sit up straight don't

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:09.009 
parents told you sit up straight don't
slouch

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
slouch

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:11.440 
slouch
so<00:03:09.769> you<00:03:09.889> set<00:03:10.189> up<00:03:10.280> straight<00:03:10.519> and<00:03:11.150> you<00:03:11.239> walked

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
so you set up straight and you walked

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.720 
so you set up straight and you walked
around<00:03:11.659> with<00:03:11.870> good<00:03:12.019> posture<00:03:12.260> your<00:03:13.010> back<00:03:13.220> erect
