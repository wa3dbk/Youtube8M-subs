going to be for the front I'm going to

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.970 
going to be for the front I'm going to
get<00:00:56.969> started<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.629> cutting<00:00:58.140> out<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.590> middle

get started on cutting out the middle

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.230 
get started on cutting out the middle
section<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:04.500> I'm<00:01:05.040> only<00:01:05.250> concerned<00:01:05.729> with<00:01:06.030> this

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
section and I'm only concerned with this

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.780 
section and I'm only concerned with this
inner<00:01:06.510> part<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:07.920> what<00:01:08.100> I'm<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.520> cut

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
inner part here is what I'm going to cut

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.480 
inner part here is what I'm going to cut
out

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.580 

and<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:18.210> cutout<00:01:18.450> doesn't<00:01:18.840> need<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.110> exact

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
and that cutout doesn't need to be exact

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.230 
and that cutout doesn't need to be exact
because<00:01:20.070> it's<00:01:20.370> going<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.550> be<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:20.730> the<00:01:20.820> inside

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
because it's going to be on the inside

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.970 
because it's going to be on the inside
it's<00:01:21.450> not<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.960> show<00:01:22.140> and<00:01:22.410> now<00:01:22.770> I<00:01:22.800> can

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
it's not going to show and now I can

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.910 
it's not going to show and now I can
attach<00:01:23.340> another<00:01:23.940> template<00:01:24.600> down<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.440> the

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
attach another template down to the

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.040 
attach another template down to the
thinnest<00:01:26.670> board<00:01:27.030> which<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.540> about<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.810> quarter

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:28.050 
thinnest board which is about a quarter

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:45.670 
thinnest board which is about a quarter
inch<00:01:28.380> thick

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.350 

so<00:01:46.680> there's<00:01:46.920> my<00:01:47.070> tone<00:01:47.430> hole<00:01:47.789> which<00:01:48.149> was

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
so there's my tone hole which was

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.240 
so there's my tone hole which was
actually<00:01:48.659> a<00:01:48.840> challenge<00:01:49.320> for<00:01:49.560> me<00:01:49.770> I'm<00:01:49.920> not<00:01:49.950> very

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
actually a challenge for me I'm not very

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.670 
actually a challenge for me I'm not very
good<00:01:50.340> on<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.670> scroll<00:01:50.970> saw<00:01:51.350> just<00:01:52.350> putting<00:01:52.619> a

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
good on the scroll saw just putting a

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.649 
good on the scroll saw just putting a
simple<00:01:53.100> hole<00:01:53.399> in<00:01:53.700> there<00:01:53.939> probably<00:01:54.210> would<00:01:54.600> have

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
simple hole in there probably would have

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.929 
simple hole in there probably would have
been<00:01:54.750> a<00:01:54.810> lot<00:01:54.960> easier<00:01:55.380> now<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.429> blew<00:01:56.670> all

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
been a lot easier now I just blew all

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.669 
been a lot easier now I just blew all
three<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.390> these<00:01:57.479> pieces<00:01:57.750> together<00:01:58.110> in<00:01:58.560> a

00:01:58.669 --> 00:01:58.679 
three of these pieces together in a

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:00.770 
three of these pieces together in a
sandwich<00:01:59.070> I've<00:01:59.310> got<00:01:59.460> my<00:01:59.640> three<00:02:00.149> quarter<00:02:00.539> inch

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
sandwich I've got my three quarter inch

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.230 
sandwich I've got my three quarter inch
piece<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.590> middle<00:02:01.799> and<00:02:02.189> this<00:02:02.700> is<00:02:02.939> just<00:02:03.090> a

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
piece in the middle and this is just a

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.270 
piece in the middle and this is just a
solid<00:02:03.509> piece<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.049> it's<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.799> little<00:02:04.979> over<00:02:05.100> a

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
solid piece and it's a little over a

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.550 
solid piece and it's a little over a
quarter<00:02:05.759> of<00:02:05.939> an<00:02:06.090> inch<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.720> then<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.319> thin

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
quarter of an inch and then the thin

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.240 
quarter of an inch and then the thin
front<00:02:08.069> piece<00:02:08.369> will<00:02:08.869> go<00:02:09.869> on<00:02:10.050> like<00:02:10.229> that

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.370 

that's<00:02:14.250> all<00:02:14.430> glued<00:02:14.700> together<00:02:14.849> now<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.900> can

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
that's all glued together now I can

00:02:16.380 --> 00:03:03.670 
that's all glued together now I can
paste<00:02:17.010> on<00:02:17.340> yet<00:02:18.269> another<00:02:18.480> tip

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.290 

I've<00:03:04.680> got<00:03:04.950> some<00:03:05.190> of<00:03:05.280> these<00:03:05.400> little<00:03:05.910> shaker

pigs<00:03:06.930> that<00:03:07.590> I'm<00:03:07.710> going<00:03:07.830> to<00:03:07.860> glue<00:03:08.160> into<00:03:08.370> these

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
pigs that I'm going to glue into these

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.750 
pigs that I'm going to glue into these
top<00:03:09.030> three<00:03:09.510> holes<00:03:09.810> these<00:03:10.740> will<00:03:10.980> hold<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
top three holes these will hold the

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.760 
top three holes these will hold the
little<00:03:11.940> strikers<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.990> little<00:03:13.230> ball<00:03:13.410> now<00:03:13.710> the

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
little strikers the little ball now the

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.370 
little strikers the little ball now the
way<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.550> tuning<00:03:15.300> mechanism<00:03:16.050> is<00:03:16.170> going

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
way that the tuning mechanism is going

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.610 
way that the tuning mechanism is going
to<00:03:16.530> work<00:03:16.830> is<00:03:17.130> I'm<00:03:17.430> going<00:03:17.610> to<00:03:17.760> drop<00:03:18.030> these<00:03:18.990> bolts

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
to work is I'm going to drop these bolts

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.830 
to work is I'm going to drop these bolts
through<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.070> backside<00:03:20.850> and<00:03:21.240> then<00:03:21.660> these

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
through the backside and then these

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.660 
through the backside and then these
three<00:03:22.170> bolts<00:03:22.530> that<00:03:22.650> have<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:23.070> little<00:03:23.310> holes

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
three bolts that have the little holes

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.580 
three bolts that have the little holes
in<00:03:24.120> them<00:03:24.300> are<00:03:24.480> all<00:03:24.990> going<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.350> go<00:03:25.530> on<00:03:25.800> this<00:03:26.670> side

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:27.590 
in them are all going to go on this side

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:30.290 
in them are all going to go on this side
these<00:03:28.590> screws<00:03:28.980> on<00:03:29.190> this<00:03:29.610> side<00:03:29.910> are<00:03:30.060> going<00:03:30.090> to

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
these screws on this side are going to

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.870 
these screws on this side are going to
be<00:03:30.390> stationary<00:03:31.320> so<00:03:31.590> I<00:03:31.620> can<00:03:31.950> crank<00:03:32.340> these<00:03:32.580> down

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
be stationary so I can crank these down

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.470 
be stationary so I can crank these down
tight<00:03:34.250> so<00:03:35.250> the<00:03:35.340> ones<00:03:35.550> with<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:35.820> holes<00:03:36.000> in<00:03:36.300> them

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
tight so the ones with the holes in them

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.320 
tight so the ones with the holes in them
are<00:03:36.630> my<00:03:36.810> tuning<00:03:37.500> pegs<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.430> I<00:03:38.700> don't<00:03:39.030> want<00:03:39.210> to

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
are my tuning pegs so I don't want to

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:40.910 
are my tuning pegs so I don't want to
tighten<00:03:39.720> this<00:03:39.870> nut<00:03:40.110> down<00:03:40.380> yet

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
tighten this nut down yet

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.430 
tighten this nut down yet
I<00:03:40.950> just<00:03:41.370> want<00:03:41.640> it<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.790> go<00:03:41.910> down<00:03:42.090> beyond<00:03:42.990> the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
I just want it to go down beyond the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.290 
I just want it to go down beyond the
hole<00:03:43.740> it's<00:03:44.310> not<00:03:44.490> going<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.700> start<00:03:44.880> stringing

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
hole it's not going to start stringing

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.240 
hole it's not going to start stringing
this<00:03:45.690> and<00:03:45.990> I'm<00:03:46.380> going<00:03:46.680> to<00:03:46.740> start<00:03:47.010> with<00:03:47.100> the

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
this and I'm going to start with the

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.690 
this and I'm going to start with the
stationary<00:03:48.030> pegs<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:49.040> just<00:03:50.040> start<00:03:50.280> to<00:03:50.400> twist

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
stationary pegs and just start to twist

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.350 
stationary pegs and just start to twist
this<00:03:51.240> around<00:03:51.510> I'm<00:03:52.350> using<00:03:52.680> some<00:03:53.250> guitar<00:03:53.880> string

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
this around I'm using some guitar string

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.510 
this around I'm using some guitar string
this<00:03:54.510> is<00:03:54.630> old<00:03:54.900> guitar<00:03:55.410> string<00:03:55.770> from<00:03:55.980> my<00:03:56.160> son's

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
this is old guitar string from my son's

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.600 
this is old guitar string from my son's
electric<00:03:57.210> guitar<00:03:57.630> I<00:03:58.380> think<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.430> could

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
electric guitar I think you could

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:07.100 
electric guitar I think you could
probably<00:03:59.850> just<00:04:00.210> use<00:04:00.300> wire<00:04:00.780> too<00:04:05.930> now<00:04:06.930> I<00:04:06.959> can

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
probably just use wire too now I can

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.080 
probably just use wire too now I can
take<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.380> other<00:04:07.560> side<00:04:07.920> and<00:04:08.250> fish<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:08.820> through

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
take the other side and fish it through

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.710 
take the other side and fish it through
that<00:04:09.300> hole<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:10.190> I'll<00:04:11.190> again<00:04:11.820> twist<00:04:12.510> this

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:12.720 
that hole and I'll again twist this

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.650 
that hole and I'll again twist this
around<00:04:12.900> itself<00:04:13.740> and<00:04:14.209> don't<00:04:15.209> have<00:04:15.360> to<00:04:15.450> get<00:04:15.570> it

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.660 
around itself and don't have to get it

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.479 
around itself and don't have to get it
too<00:04:15.840> tight<00:04:16.140> just<00:04:16.440> yet<00:04:19.100> using<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.190> screwdriver

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
too tight just yet using a screwdriver

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.180 
too tight just yet using a screwdriver
start<00:04:21.090> to<00:04:21.270> twist<00:04:21.660> this<00:04:22.020> around<00:04:22.260> itself<00:04:22.950> and

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
start to twist this around itself and

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.390 
start to twist this around itself and
tighten<00:04:23.730> up<00:04:23.850> that<00:04:24.270> wire<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:25.230> when<00:04:25.920> I<00:04:25.950> get<00:04:26.100> it

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:26.400 
tighten up that wire and when I get it

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.330 
tighten up that wire and when I get it
as<00:04:26.550> tight<00:04:26.610> as<00:04:27.180> I<00:04:27.390> think<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.780> ought<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:27.930> be<00:04:28.340> I'll

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
as tight as I think it ought to be I'll

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:37.600 
as tight as I think it ought to be I'll
just<00:04:29.640> lock<00:04:29.910> down<00:04:30.270> this<00:04:30.510> nut

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.040 

one<00:04:38.610> thing<00:04:38.759> I<00:04:38.850> decided<00:04:39.210> to<00:04:39.449> do<00:04:39.600> is<00:04:39.750> to<00:04:39.870> put<00:04:40.020> a

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
one thing I decided to do is to put a

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.499 
one thing I decided to do is to put a
split<00:04:40.500> lock<00:04:40.800> washer<00:04:41.100> washer<00:04:41.669> in<00:04:42.120> each<00:04:42.330> of

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
split lock washer washer in each of

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:45.950 
split lock washer washer in each of
these<00:04:42.630> holes<00:04:42.990> just<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.800> help<00:04:44.699> keep<00:04:44.910> this<00:04:45.240> screw

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:45.960 
these holes just to help keep this screw

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.050 
these holes just to help keep this screw
from<00:04:46.259> spinning<00:04:46.590> around<00:04:46.949> even<00:04:47.250> more<00:04:47.280> I<00:04:47.759> picked

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
from spinning around even more I picked

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.090 
from spinning around even more I picked
up<00:04:48.180> some<00:04:48.389> of<00:04:48.419> these<00:04:48.570> wooden<00:04:49.080> balls<00:04:49.380> at<00:04:49.680> a<00:04:49.710> craft

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
up some of these wooden balls at a craft

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.990 
up some of these wooden balls at a craft
store<00:04:50.310> to<00:04:50.850> use<00:04:51.150> for<00:04:51.690> the<00:04:52.050> strikers<00:04:52.729> they<00:04:53.729> come

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
store to use for the strikers they come

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.300 
store to use for the strikers they come
with<00:04:54.240> holes<00:04:54.720> in<00:04:54.990> them<00:04:55.110> at<00:04:55.199> least<00:04:55.320> mine<00:04:55.800> did<00:04:56.130> and

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
with holes in them at least mine did and

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:58.640 
with holes in them at least mine did and
so<00:04:56.430> I<00:04:56.460> just<00:04:56.729> filled<00:04:56.970> those<00:04:57.210> with<00:04:57.630> a<00:04:57.870> piece<00:04:58.259> of<00:04:58.470> a

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
so I just filled those with a piece of a

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.159 
so I just filled those with a piece of a
dowel<00:04:58.949> and<00:04:59.340> now<00:05:00.090> what<00:05:00.240> I'm<00:05:00.330> doing<00:05:00.360> is<00:05:00.750> I've<00:05:00.960> got

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:01.169 
dowel and now what I'm doing is I've got

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:04.939 
dowel and now what I'm doing is I've got
these<00:05:01.440> eyelets<00:05:02.430> that<00:05:02.699> I'm<00:05:03.240> just<00:05:03.509> screwing<00:05:04.410> one

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:04.949 
these eyelets that I'm just screwing one

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.640 
these eyelets that I'm just screwing one
into<00:05:05.370> each<00:05:05.520> one<00:05:05.820> just<00:05:06.539> attaching<00:05:07.110> these<00:05:07.320> with

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 
into each one just attaching these with

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.620 
into each one just attaching these with
some<00:05:07.919> fishing<00:05:08.520> line<00:05:11.030> well<00:05:12.030> the<00:05:12.150> hard<00:05:12.389> part

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
some fishing line well the hard part

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.930 
some fishing line well the hard part
here<00:05:13.080> is<00:05:13.259> trying<00:05:13.710> to<00:05:13.800> tie<00:05:14.070> this<00:05:14.130> in<00:05:14.520> such<00:05:14.699> a<00:05:14.729> way

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
here is trying to tie this in such a way

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:18.830 
here is trying to tie this in such a way
that<00:05:14.970> it's<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:15.419> right<00:05:15.630> length<00:05:16.370> that<00:05:17.840> looks

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
that it's the right length that looks

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.070

like I'm getting it so there's what it

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.999 
like I'm getting it so there's what it
sounds<00:05:22.380> like

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:24.009 
sounds like

00:05:24.009 --> 00:05:25.559 
sounds like
I<00:05:24.099> don't<00:05:24.729> know<00:05:24.789> if<00:05:24.849> you<00:05:24.909> can<00:05:24.999> hear<00:05:25.119> that<00:05:25.240> honey

00:05:33.149 --> 00:05:33.159 
hold it up I can still fuss around with

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:34.439 
hold it up I can still fuss around with
it<00:05:33.399> and<00:05:33.520> tune<00:05:33.699> it<00:05:33.879> a<00:05:33.939> little<00:05:34.119> bit<00:05:34.300> but<00:05:34.389> that

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:34.449 
it and tune it a little bit but that

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:35.909 
it and tune it a little bit but that
sounds<00:05:34.749> pretty<00:05:34.869> good<00:05:35.110> I'm<00:05:35.319> pretty<00:05:35.529> happy<00:05:35.710> with

00:05:35.909 --> 00:05:35.919

sounds pretty good I'm pretty happy with
that

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:36.159 
that

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:37.950 
that
to<00:05:36.520> attach<00:05:36.759> it<00:05:36.939> to<00:05:36.969> the<00:05:37.180> door<00:05:37.419> I've<00:05:37.689> just

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 
to attach it to the door I've just

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.260 
to attach it to the door I've just
picked<00:05:38.409> up<00:05:38.499> a<00:05:38.619> culpable<00:05:39.099> of<00:05:39.369> these<00:05:39.759> kind<00:05:40.149> of

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:40.270 
picked up a culpable of these kind of

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.089 
picked up a culpable of these kind of
cleats<00:05:40.719> that<00:05:40.899> this<00:05:41.229> one<00:05:41.409> will<00:05:41.529> go<00:05:41.680> on<00:05:41.710> the<00:05:41.919> door

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:42.099 
cleats that this one will go on the door

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.100 
cleats that this one will go on the door
and<00:05:42.399> it'll<00:05:42.580> just<00:05:42.819> slide<00:05:43.089> it<00:05:43.270> in<00:05:43.330> like<00:05:43.389> that<00:05:43.839> to

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.110 
and it'll just slide it in like that to

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.769 
and it'll just slide it in like that to
hold<00:05:44.319> it<00:05:44.499> I<00:05:44.710> decided<00:05:45.610> to<00:05:45.759> put<00:05:45.939> it<00:05:45.969> on<00:05:46.119> an<00:05:46.270> inside

00:05:46.769 --> 00:05:46.779 
hold it I decided to put it on an inside

door<00:05:47.139> one<00:05:47.439> that<00:05:47.589> gets<00:05:47.800> used<00:05:48.039> pretty

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:48.339 
door one that gets used pretty

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:50.999 
door one that gets used pretty
frequently<00:05:49.139> because<00:05:50.139> it's<00:05:50.349> really<00:05:50.559> not<00:05:50.770> loud

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:51.009 
frequently because it's really not loud

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:53.369 
frequently because it's really not loud
enough<00:05:51.039> for<00:05:51.369> the<00:05:51.639> outside<00:05:52.149> door<00:05:52.419> I<00:05:52.659> think<00:05:53.139> that

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:53.379 
enough for the outside door I think that

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:55.499 
enough for the outside door I think that
if<00:05:54.009> you<00:05:54.189> were<00:05:54.279> to<00:05:54.399> make<00:05:54.520> the<00:05:54.669> whole<00:05:54.909> different

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:55.509 
if you were to make the whole different

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.869 
if you were to make the whole different
maybe<00:05:55.689> bigger<00:05:56.399> maybe<00:05:57.399> make<00:05:57.610> the<00:05:57.699> whole<00:05:57.849> thing

00:05:57.869 --> 00:05:57.879 
maybe bigger maybe make the whole thing

00:05:57.879 --> 00:05:59.549 
maybe bigger maybe make the whole thing
bigger<00:05:58.330> I<00:05:58.419> don't<00:05:58.659> know<00:05:58.719> play<00:05:58.990> around<00:05:59.199> with<00:05:59.409> it

00:05:59.549 --> 00:05:59.559 
bigger I don't know play around with it

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:01.619 
bigger I don't know play around with it
you<00:05:59.649> probably<00:05:59.860> get<00:06:00.099> louder<00:06:00.430> tones<00:06:00.999> out<00:06:01.360> of<00:06:01.419> it

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:01.629 
you probably get louder tones out of it

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:03.739 
you probably get louder tones out of it
but<00:06:01.899> as<00:06:02.050> it<00:06:02.080> is<00:06:02.229> now<00:06:02.529> it<00:06:02.770> sounds<00:06:02.979> pretty<00:06:03.430> good

00:06:03.739 --> 00:06:03.749 
but as it is now it sounds pretty good

00:06:03.749 --> 00:06:05.879 
but as it is now it sounds pretty good
this<00:06:04.749> is<00:06:04.870> one<00:06:04.960> of<00:06:04.990> those<00:06:05.169> projects<00:06:05.649> that<00:06:05.710> you

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
this is one of those projects that you

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:08.249 
this is one of those projects that you
could<00:06:06.099> take<00:06:06.490> a<00:06:06.550> lot<00:06:06.759> of<00:06:06.909> time<00:06:07.180> and<00:06:07.479> experiment

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.259 
could take a lot of time and experiment

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:10.980 
could take a lot of time and experiment
with<00:06:08.439> you<00:06:08.680> could<00:06:08.919> probably<00:06:09.460> make<00:06:09.990> heavier

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
with you could probably make heavier

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.899 
with you could probably make heavier
Strykers<00:06:11.680> might<00:06:11.919> change<00:06:12.279> it<00:06:12.520> you<00:06:12.639> could<00:06:12.759> add

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
Strykers might change it you could add

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.149 
Strykers might change it you could add
more<00:06:12.939> strings<00:06:13.599> play<00:06:14.229> with<00:06:14.469> the<00:06:14.589> size<00:06:14.800> of<00:06:15.039> the

00:06:15.149 --> 00:06:15.159 
more strings play with the size of the

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:17.159 
more strings play with the size of the
hole<00:06:15.399> there's<00:06:16.240> a<00:06:16.300> lot<00:06:16.449> of<00:06:16.569> variables<00:06:17.020> in

hole there's a lot of variables in

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:22.519 
hole there's a lot of variables in
probably<00:06:17.709> getting<00:06:17.949> a<00:06:18.099> good<00:06:18.339> tone<00:06:18.699> out<00:06:18.939> of<00:06:18.969> this
