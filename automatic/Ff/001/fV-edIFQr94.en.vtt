00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
first Angry Bird there's an angry bird

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.080 
first Angry Bird there's an angry bird
that<00:00:25.740> comes<00:00:25.920> out<00:00:26.130> every<00:00:26.279> week<00:00:26.640> for<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:26.939> next

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
that comes out every week for the next

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.849 
that comes out every week for the next
three<00:00:27.240> weeks<00:00:27.630> and<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.019> event<00:00:28.259> lasts<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.710> month

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.179 
I think in order to get the first bird

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
you need to collect a hundred of the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.540 
you need to collect a hundred of the
Angry<00:00:32.519> Birds<00:00:32.759> tokens<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:34.400> here<00:00:35.400> I'll<00:00:35.519> just

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
Angry Birds tokens and here I'll just

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:36.979 
Angry Birds tokens and here I'll just
gonna<00:00:35.820> tell<00:00:36.000> you<00:00:36.089> a<00:00:36.120> little<00:00:36.210> trick<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.629> get<00:00:36.870> all

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
gonna tell you a little trick to get all

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.020 
gonna tell you a little trick to get all
of<00:00:37.110> them<00:00:37.280> so<00:00:38.280> all<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.489> have<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.640> do<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.909> just

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
of them so all you have to do is just

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.329 
of them so all you have to do is just
play<00:00:39.299> and<00:00:39.750> then<00:00:40.229> once<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.620> get<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.799> token<00:00:41.040> the

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:41.339 
play and then once you get a token the

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:42.680 
play and then once you get a token the
tokens<00:00:41.670> usually<00:00:41.940> show<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.239> within<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.659> first

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
tokens usually show up within the first

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.840 
tokens usually show up within the first
little<00:00:43.619> bit<00:00:43.739> you're<00:00:44.280> gonna<00:00:44.369> pause<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.820> game

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
little bit you're gonna pause the game

little bit you're gonna pause the game
click<00:00:45.299> home<00:00:45.479> and<00:00:45.659> then<00:00:45.750> restart<00:00:46.110> again<00:00:46.430> this

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
click home and then restart again this

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.890 
click home and then restart again this
would<00:00:47.610> allow<00:00:47.790> you<00:00:47.850> to<00:00:48.000> just<00:00:48.180> keep<00:00:48.600> getting<00:00:48.869> the

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:48.900 
would allow you to just keep getting the

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.780 
would allow you to just keep getting the
tokens<00:00:49.350> pretty<00:00:49.680> easily<00:00:49.860> from<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> beginning

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:50.790 
tokens pretty easily from the beginning

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.910 
tokens pretty easily from the beginning
instead<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.629> going<00:00:51.930> through<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.350> potentially

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
instead of going through and potentially

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.270 
instead of going through and potentially
dying<00:00:54.199> and<00:00:55.199> wasting<00:00:55.530> time<00:00:55.680> trying<00:00:55.979> to<00:00:56.010> find

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
dying and wasting time trying to find

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.740 
dying and wasting time trying to find
all<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> other<00:00:56.640> tokens<00:00:57.089> when<00:00:57.269> you<00:00:57.360> know<00:00:57.510> that

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
all the other tokens when you know that

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.210 
all the other tokens when you know that
they're<00:00:57.900> just<00:00:58.260> gonna<00:00:58.350> be<00:00:58.559> showing<00:00:58.890> up<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.210 --> 00:00:59.220 
they're just gonna be showing up in the

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:01.850 
they're just gonna be showing up in the
beginning<00:01:00.080> some<00:01:01.080> of<00:01:01.170> them<00:01:01.260> show<00:01:01.739> up

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:01.860 
beginning some of them show up

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.200 
beginning some of them show up
immediately<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.549> beginning<00:01:02.879> someone<00:01:03.150> to

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
immediately in the beginning someone to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.969 
immediately in the beginning someone to
take<00:01:03.390> a<00:01:03.420> little<00:01:03.629> while<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:03.960> get<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.140> but

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
take a little while to get to but

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.170 
take a little while to get to but
eventually<00:01:05.100> you'll<00:01:05.549> reach<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.880> within<00:01:06.060> like

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
eventually you'll reach it within like

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.690 
eventually you'll reach it within like
five<00:01:06.450> seconds<00:01:06.990> I<00:01:07.140> think<00:01:07.799> in<00:01:07.890> order<00:01:07.979> to<00:01:08.130> in

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
five seconds I think in order to in

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.779 
five seconds I think in order to in

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:11.789 
order for me to get a 100 tokens it only

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:13.910 
order for me to get a 100 tokens it only
took<00:01:11.939> me<00:01:12.000> like<00:01:12.119> 10<00:01:12.479> minutes<00:01:12.509> so<00:01:12.990> you<00:01:13.679> can<00:01:13.740> get

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
took me like 10 minutes so you can get

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.270 
took me like 10 minutes so you can get
