reasons the simple art is nice and
colorful<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.749> as<00:01:49.899> I<00:01:50.049> said<00:01:50.109> the<00:01:50.409> music<00:01:50.709> is

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
awesome although the sound quality could

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.319 
awesome although the sound quality could
really<00:01:53.109> use<00:01:53.380> some<00:01:53.619> work<00:01:53.829> I<00:01:54.189> really<00:01:54.909> like<00:01:55.119> the

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
really use some work I really like the

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.179 
really use some work I really like the
general<00:01:55.719> concepts<00:01:56.319> and<00:01:56.469> the<00:01:56.530> ideas<00:01:56.590> here<00:01:57.069> as

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
general concepts and the ideas here as

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.209 
general concepts and the ideas here as
well<00:01:57.429> it's<00:01:57.969> really<00:01:58.329> a<00:01:58.359> very<00:01:58.569> cool<00:01:58.689> game<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.590> just

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:00.219 
well it's really a very cool game I just

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:01.919 
well it's really a very cool game I just
have<00:02:00.399> a<00:02:00.429> really<00:02:00.670> hard<00:02:00.909> time<00:02:00.969> with<00:02:01.179> it<00:02:01.509> even<00:02:01.869> on

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:01.929 
have a really hard time with it even on

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:04.080 
have a really hard time with it even on
the<00:02:02.079> easy<00:02:02.289> difficulty<00:02:03.069> and<00:02:03.310> I<00:02:03.429> think<00:02:03.700> it's<00:02:03.880> due

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 
the easy difficulty and I think it's due

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.489 
the easy difficulty and I think it's due
to<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.359> random<00:02:04.719> nature<00:02:04.929> of<00:02:05.200> the<00:02:05.319> tower

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:05.499 
to the random nature of the tower

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:07.199 
to the random nature of the tower
building<00:02:06.009> each<00:02:06.579> level<00:02:06.939> has<00:02:07.029> three

00:02:07.199 --> 00:02:07.209 
building each level has three

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:09.449 
building each level has three
difficulties<00:02:08.050> and<00:02:08.200> an<00:02:08.500> endless<00:02:08.770> mode<00:02:09.130> to<00:02:09.310> play

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
difficulties and an endless mode to play

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.179 
difficulties and an endless mode to play
as<00:02:09.670> well<00:02:09.880> this<00:02:10.659> is<00:02:10.840> a<00:02:10.869> solid<00:02:11.349> game<00:02:11.590> but<00:02:11.920> as<00:02:12.040> it

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:12.189 
as well this is a solid game but as it

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:14.580 
as well this is a solid game but as it
is<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:12.549> feel<00:02:12.730> it<00:02:12.790> as<00:02:13.030> too<00:02:13.239> many<00:02:13.360> problems<00:02:13.689> the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
is I feel it as too many problems the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:15.800 
is I feel it as too many problems the
developers<00:02:15.159> have<00:02:15.310> actually
