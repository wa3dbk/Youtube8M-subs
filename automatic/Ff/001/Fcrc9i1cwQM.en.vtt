00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.130 
actually have a physiological response
causes<00:00:53.309> cortisol<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.910> go<00:00:54.030> up<00:00:54.180> which<00:00:54.750> reduces

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
causes cortisol to go up which reduces

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.340 
causes cortisol to go up which reduces
sleep<00:00:55.379> quality<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.600> and<00:00:57.600> makes<00:00:58.230> you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
sleep quality and and makes you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.990

those<00:01:00.120> types<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.480> things<00:01:00.540> so<00:01:00.900> I<00:01:01.110> think<00:01:01.620> knowing

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
those types of things so I think knowing

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.420 
those types of things so I think knowing
that<00:01:03.410> enjoyment<00:01:04.410> as<00:01:04.769> part<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.070> it<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.339> you

that enjoyment as part of it and you

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.280 
that enjoyment as part of it and you
have<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.330> have<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.540> do<00:01:06.720> some<00:01:06.960> things<00:01:07.020> you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
like once in a while don't force

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.260 
like once in a while don't force
yourself<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:09.030> do<00:01:09.320> things<00:01:10.670> like<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:11.940> workout

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
yourself to do things like a workout

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.520 
yourself to do things like a workout
program<00:01:12.660> you<00:01:12.810> don't<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.080> if<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.229> don't<00:01:13.290> like

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
program you don't like if you don't like

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.080 
program you don't like if you don't like
your<00:01:13.680> workout<00:01:14.040> program<00:01:14.400> find<00:01:14.670> when<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.850> do

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
your workout program find when you do

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.150 
your workout program find when you do
like<00:01:15.300> and<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.140> go<00:01:16.410> with<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.649> I<00:01:16.710> think<00:01:17.009> that's

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
like and and go with that I think that's

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.070 
like and and go with that I think that's
really<00:01:17.399> important<00:01:17.759> mentally<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.390> therefore

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
really important mentally and therefore

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.070 
really important mentally and therefore
i<00:01:19.110> think<00:01:19.290> that's<00:01:19.410> not<00:01:19.560> important<00:01:20.220> long-term

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
i think that's not important long-term

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:25.110 
i think that's not important long-term
for<00:01:22.080> home

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.310

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
a lot of them really don't know a lot

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.910 
a lot of them really don't know a lot
about<00:01:35.510> good<00:01:36.260> nutrition<00:01:36.290> and<00:01:36.830> what

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
about good nutrition and what

constitutes good nutrition and that

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.020 
constitutes good nutrition and that
Tamizh<00:01:39.830> are<00:01:39.980> exciting<00:01:40.370> because<00:01:40.520> they're<00:01:40.850> such

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
Tamizh are exciting because they're such

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.880 
Tamizh are exciting because they're such
great<00:01:41.300> athletes<00:01:41.810> at<00:01:41.930> the<00:01:42.080> top<00:01:42.290> of<00:01:42.320> their<00:01:42.500> sport

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
but they've got this untapped potential

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.840 
but they've got this untapped potential
on<00:01:44.900> the<00:01:44.990> table<00:01:45.380> that<00:01:45.560> if<00:01:46.010> they<00:01:46.370> do<00:01:46.640> start

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
on the table that if they do start

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.950 
on the table that if they do start
digging<00:01:47.210> into<00:01:47.330> this<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:47.920> eating<00:01:49.840> some<00:01:50.840> of

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
digging into this and eating some of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.300 
digging into this and eating some of
these<00:01:51.610> suggestions<00:01:52.610> that<00:01:53.210> I'm<00:01:53.570> making<00:01:53.960> and

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:54.310 
these suggestions that I'm making and

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.980 
these suggestions that I'm making and
start<00:01:55.310> getting<00:01:55.400> into<00:01:55.760> that<00:01:55.880> it<00:01:56.210> really<00:01:56.630> will

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
start getting into that it really will

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.750 
start getting into that it really will
boost<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.650> performance<00:01:57.830> will<00:01:58.310> allow<00:01:58.430> them<00:01:58.640> to

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
boost the performance will allow them to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.310 
boost the performance will allow them to
train<00:01:58.940> more<00:01:59.150> and<00:01:59.330> less<00:01:59.450> time<00:01:59.660> so<00:01:59.960> we'll<00:02:00.050> speed

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
train more and less time so we'll speed

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.780 
train more and less time so we'll speed
recovery<00:02:00.590> time<00:02:00.920> and<00:02:01.340> that's<00:02:01.460> going<00:02:01.580> to<00:02:01.640> boost

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:01.790 
recovery time and that's going to boost

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:03.400 
recovery time and that's going to boost
their<00:02:01.910> performance<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.450> good<00:02:03.200> nutrition

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:03.410 
their performance and good nutrition

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.110 
their performance and good nutrition
