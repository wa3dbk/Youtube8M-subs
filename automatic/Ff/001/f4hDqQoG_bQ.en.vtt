00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:04.800
 arrives 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:32.509
 I'm a bit confused how it was 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.430
 announced before it's time to make a 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.650
 medium versus our dearest 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.449
 colorful pegasus against one of the 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.840
 most emblematic characters in both 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:40.840
 games 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.440
 sonic the edison there is no need to discuss 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.660
 person who gives more time before 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.650
 popularity since its first appearance 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.680
 it was in his video game in 1991 instead 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:56.809
 at weddings were October 2010 ago 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.580
 time I wanted to make this video more 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.910
 that nothing for his fan fiction and his 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.910
 crossover 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.330
 both have series 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.340
 both they have comics and both have to 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.640
 that incredible passion for speed 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.890
 It will be very cool to see them compete for the 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.710
 title of the fastest nobody likes 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.619
 lose because they can not stand the defeat 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:32.020
 misfortune the shame the bitter drink 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.380
 from the second place in I think that it 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.180
 he understood the sound design is very 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.330
 aerodynamic as if it were created only 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.060
 to run gives the style of rd is very 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.360
 striking for its incredible colors is 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:49.539
 plus 90% who know the little series 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.789
 pony was thanks to re fashions as his 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:55.410
 server 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.410
 and what do they tell me about their cosplays? 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.009
 in 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:06.270
 If so, but it does not convince me perfect 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:14.920
 I hope it is a photoshop 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.020
 now I have seen many 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.170
 illustrations and fanzines jones that 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.380
 they talk about a possible big breakthrough me what 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.380
 I think 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.750
 and that's not love going back to the 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.870
 competition what would happen 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.300
 susan all their potential or powers already 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.400

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.400
