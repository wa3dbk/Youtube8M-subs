00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.590
 I am not a supporter of the left turns as in 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.230
 city ​​and the federal road 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.910
 because it is very dangerous in the city 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.269
 they still create and which we 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.529
 situations and should be left turns not 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.579
 be present only on edge on 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.310
 crosswalks 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.370
 then we will have 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:39.850
 heavy traffic increased because 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.230
 that practice shows that if 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.120
 the driver turns left and 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.620
 begins to rebuild it for him 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.240
 adjust at least a million to 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.480
 cities where intensively cheaper 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:51.140
 movement is very big big flow 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:59.450
 of transport 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:01:00.860
 although they go straight on 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.260
 New Year holidays from the thirty first 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.050
 numbers we move to the amplified version 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.940
 service drunk driver with us 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:11.420
 this practice was she will continue 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.790
 until we have the last one 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.530
 drivers we will not be able to identify 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.560
 intoxication for what are we 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.720
 do the media so that people understand what's coming 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.670
 raids and at least if we have several 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.560
 the man did not sit down for management spend 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.300
 intoxicated then 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.160
 there will be some kind of result we are in 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.200
 as a preventive, we give 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.600
 information that the operation is going drunk 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.550
 our driver is from practice Friday 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.590
 saturday sunday but it is not excluded 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.330
 that we will and monday tuesday 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.440
 Wednesday 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.270
 give especially on holidays 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.660
 because you know yourself on holidays 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.080
 Our practice shows throughout Russia 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.030
 what 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.490
 New Year's holidays us increasing 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.490
 detectability in a state of alcoholic 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.490
 intoxication 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.710
 when pointing to today's long 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.240
 State traffic inspectorate that if the owner 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.400
 came to the vehicle not 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.410
 must return it but there are small 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:09.130
 nuances that evacuators belong min he 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.840
 not on and it is not in team dress 

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.570
 set tough traffic police 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.370
 vehicle give away also 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.350
 given command from blond gsmart to watch 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.560
 that there were no nuances that there 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.450
 children are and older people and just 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.550
 evacuated according 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.200
 by law 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.510
 the car is not given but now in 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.340
 the State Duma arrived that did not start 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.070
 move the car but we have to transfer 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.930
 work ahead of time if the owner 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:36.700
 I came why he did not give him he will pay 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:44.830
 penalty for breaking the stop rules and 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:47.740
 parking cars will clean us in Rostov 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:50.020
 area 262 driving school 60 branches on 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.090
 got us today 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.430
 the conclusion is 30 percent in total 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.620
 the complexity there is the main problem we have 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:58.660
 these are racing tracks they should be or 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.150
 rented equipped 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:04.230
 today in driving schools this 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:06.730
 I did not attend many I hope that 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.380
 the future when all this will be with us 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:14.070
 drivers will still not produce 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.070
