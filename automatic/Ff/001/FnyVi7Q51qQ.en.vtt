refilled<00:01:51.270> by<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.630> control<00:01:51.960> let's<00:01:52.140> see<00:01:52.259> where

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
refilled by in control let's see where

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.560 
refilled by in control let's see where
he<00:01:52.409> goes<00:01:52.530> with<00:01:52.829> this<00:01:52.979> well<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.759> know<00:01:53.909> it's<00:01:54.210> it

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
he goes with this well you know it's it

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.389 
he goes with this well you know it's it
could<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.110> fact<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.439> he<00:01:55.530> may<00:01:55.979> be<00:01:56.040> doesn't

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
could be the fact that he may be doesn't

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:57.740 
could be the fact that he may be doesn't
want<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.790> use<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.119> RAM<00:01:57.360> because<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
want to just use the RAM because the

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.590 
want to just use the RAM because the
ramp<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.140> pretty<00:01:58.439> wide<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:59.189> his<00:01:59.939> map<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.479> he

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
ramp is pretty wide in his map so he

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.270 
ramp is pretty wide in his map so he
could<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.110> trying<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.500> do<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:01.860> little<00:02:02.100> bit

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
could be just trying to do a little bit

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.810 
could be just trying to do a little bit
more<00:02:02.549> economical<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.950> timely<00:02:04.950> fast<00:02:05.399> expand

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
more economical and timely fast expand

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.310 
more economical and timely fast expand
trying<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.240> see<00:02:06.390> if<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.600> can<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:07.229> know

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
trying to see if you can you know

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.199 
trying to see if you can you know
utilize<00:02:07.829> the<00:02:08.009> Nexus<00:02:08.369> as<00:02:08.520> part<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.000> wall

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
utilize the Nexus as part of the wall

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.059 
utilize the Nexus as part of the wall
and<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.840> know<00:02:09.899> cannon<00:02:10.379> based<00:02:10.590> around<00:02:10.709> that

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
and you know cannon based around that

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.250 
and you know cannon based around that
the<00:02:11.550> only<00:02:11.670> problem<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.239> he's<00:02:12.390> gonna<00:02:12.480> let

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
the only problem is that he's gonna let

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.860 
the only problem is that he's gonna let
in<00:02:13.590> units<00:02:14.430> up<00:02:14.549> the<00:02:14.879> ramp<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:15.360> you<00:02:15.510> can<00:02:15.629> cause

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
in units up the ramp and you can cause

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.360 
in units up the ramp and you can cause
to<00:02:16.049> just<00:02:16.200> kind<00:02:16.379> of<00:02:16.409> keep<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.709> pages<00:02:17.040> on<00:02:17.159> his

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
to just kind of keep the pages on his

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.039 
to just kind of keep the pages on his
opponent<00:02:17.819> we'll<00:02:18.390> have<00:02:18.510> to<00:02:18.629> see<00:02:18.750> how<00:02:18.780> in

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:19.049 
opponent we'll have to see how in

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.569 
opponent we'll have to see how in
control<00:02:19.140> actually<00:02:19.590> balances<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.129> out<00:02:20.340> keep

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
control actually balances that out keep

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:22.069 
control actually balances that out keep
in<00:02:20.670> mind<00:02:20.849> destiny<00:02:21.209> did<00:02:21.360> choose<00:02:21.510> this<00:02:21.599> map<00:02:21.840> it

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:22.079 
in mind destiny did choose this map it

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:24.830 
in mind destiny did choose this map it
is<00:02:22.769> his<00:02:23.189> choice<00:02:23.549> and<00:02:23.879> this<00:02:24.390> is<00:02:24.510> an<00:02:24.629> interesting

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
is his choice and this is an interesting

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.330 
is his choice and this is an interesting
map<00:02:25.200> in<00:02:25.379> general<00:02:25.650> because<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:26.069> way<00:02:26.280> you

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
map in general because the way you

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.309 
map in general because the way you
expand<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.239> kind<00:02:27.480> of<00:02:27.510> have<00:02:27.629> a<00:02:27.659> clockwise

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
expand you kind of have a clockwise

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.250 
expand you kind of have a clockwise
expansion<00:02:29.159> path<00:02:29.370> in<00:02:29.610> a<00:02:29.700> linear<00:02:29.909> formation<00:02:30.599> as

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
expansion path in a linear formation as

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.899 
expansion path in a linear formation as
you<00:02:31.440> can<00:02:31.590> see<00:02:31.739> destiny<00:02:32.010> would<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.370> expanding

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:32.909 
you can see destiny would be expanding

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.729 
you can see destiny would be expanding
towards<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.629> northern<00:02:33.840> right<00:02:34.170> but<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.620> also

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
towards the northern right but you also

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.170 
towards the northern right but you also
have<00:02:34.920> these<00:02:35.010> middle<00:02:35.340> expansions<00:02:35.879> and<00:02:36.000> these

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
have these middle expansions and these

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.789 
have these middle expansions and these
watchtowers<00:02:36.750> with<00:02:36.900> different<00:02:37.200> paths<00:02:37.440> which

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799 
watchtowers with different paths which

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:39.860 
watchtowers with different paths which
is<00:02:38.010> you<00:02:38.760> know<00:02:38.819> actually<00:02:39.060> pretty<00:02:39.420> wide<00:02:39.659> open

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
is you know actually pretty wide open

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.110 
is you know actually pretty wide open
which<00:02:40.260> might<00:02:40.590> help<00:02:40.799> zurk<00:02:41.250> a<00:02:41.370> lot<00:02:41.579> in<00:02:41.700> terms<00:02:41.909> of

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
which might help zurk a lot in terms of

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.610 
which might help zurk a lot in terms of
being<00:02:42.420> able<00:02:42.599> to<00:02:42.810> take<00:02:43.109> different<00:02:43.319> routes

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
being able to take different routes

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.220 
being able to take different routes
counter-attacks<00:02:44.549> and<00:02:44.879> generally<00:02:45.780> have<00:02:45.989> that

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
counter-attacks and generally have that

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.589 
counter-attacks and generally have that
mobility<00:02:46.620> especially<00:02:47.579> destiny<00:02:48.060> loves<00:02:48.390> that

mobility especially destiny loves that

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.020 
mobility especially destiny loves that
Lincoln<00:02:49.290> fester<00:02:49.709> and<00:02:49.950> also<00:02:50.190> Mia<00:02:50.459> type<00:02:50.730> play

just being able to move on to mobility
but<00:02:53.489> hold<00:02:54.420> that<00:02:54.629> thought<00:02:54.810> destiny<00:02:55.260> is

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
but hold that thought destiny is

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.460 
but hold that thought destiny is
actually<00:02:55.620> going<00:02:55.769> for<00:02:55.859> a<00:02:56.010> baby<00:02:56.310> nest<00:02:56.690> hi<00:02:57.690> this

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.330 
now what would you hit which you go for
the<00:03:21.959> pile<00:03:22.199> on<00:03:22.349> which<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:22.769> try<00:03:22.889> to<00:03:22.949> go<00:03:23.069> into<00:03:23.220> the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
the pile on which you try to go into the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.490 
the pile on which you try to go into the
main<00:03:23.489> base<00:03:23.730> yeah<00:03:24.690> you'd<00:03:24.870> ever<00:03:24.989> need<00:03:25.199> a<00:03:25.260> hit

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
main base yeah you'd ever need a hit

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.559 
main base yeah you'd ever need a hit
where<00:03:25.709> the<00:03:26.010> balls<00:03:26.250> weakest<00:03:26.730> just<00:03:27.329> because

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
where the balls weakest just because

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.240 
where the balls weakest just because
there's<00:03:27.750> lots<00:03:27.989> of<00:03:28.139> room<00:03:28.349> and<00:03:28.620> flexibility<00:03:29.190> for

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
there's lots of room and flexibility for

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.069 
there's lots of room and flexibility for
protoss<00:03:29.669> to<00:03:29.849> be<00:03:29.940> able<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.209> manage<00:03:30.720> it<00:03:30.870> if<00:03:30.959> you

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
protoss to be able to manage it if you

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:32.629 
protoss to be able to manage it if you
go<00:03:31.260> for<00:03:31.410> like<00:03:31.500> the<00:03:31.590> huge<00:03:31.829> buildings<00:03:32.250> Protoss

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:32.639 
go for like the huge buildings Protoss

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:35.059 
go for like the huge buildings Protoss
can<00:03:32.849> somehow<00:03:33.090> you<00:03:33.810> know<00:03:33.930> fill<00:03:34.440> up<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.680> gap

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
can somehow you know fill up that gap

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.250 
can somehow you know fill up that gap
again<00:03:35.370> but<00:03:35.609> actually<00:03:36.000> we<00:03:36.419> might<00:03:36.540> not<00:03:36.840> get<00:03:37.139> an

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
again but actually we might not get an

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.039 
again but actually we might not get an
opportunity<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.829> see<00:03:38.099> it<00:03:38.220> because<00:03:38.489> in<00:03:38.639> control

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
opportunity to see it because in control

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:42.319 
opportunity to see it because in control
his<00:03:40.049> wall<00:03:40.530> is<00:03:40.709> really<00:03:41.069> awkward<00:03:41.370> right<00:03:41.819> now<00:03:42.000> but

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
his wall is really awkward right now but

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:43.909 
his wall is really awkward right now but
it's<00:03:42.540> somehow<00:03:42.900> gonna<00:03:43.440> work<00:03:43.650> he's<00:03:43.799> gonna

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
it's somehow gonna work he's gonna

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:45.619 
it's somehow gonna work he's gonna
definitely<00:03:44.250> place<00:03:44.519> another<00:03:44.970> building<00:03:45.359> right

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
definitely place another building right

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.659 
definitely place another building right
here<00:03:45.660> or<00:03:46.230> probably<00:03:46.799> just<00:03:47.099> seal<00:03:47.250> it<00:03:47.280> off<00:03:47.489> on

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
here or probably just seal it off on

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:48.890 
here or probably just seal it off on
this<00:03:47.819> little<00:03:47.970> corner<00:03:48.150> but<00:03:48.359> he<00:03:48.419> sees<00:03:48.569> a<00:03:48.599> lot<00:03:48.810> of

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
this little corner but he sees a lot of

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.750 
this little corner but he sees a lot of
servings<00:03:49.349> and<00:03:49.500> he<00:03:49.980> actually<00:03:50.069> used<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.489> probe

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
servings and he actually used the probe

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.339 
servings and he actually used the probe
to<00:03:50.970> wall<00:03:51.150> off<00:03:51.180> here<00:03:51.510> but<00:03:51.720> he<00:03:51.840> actually<00:03:51.989> lets

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
to wall off here but he actually lets

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.129 
to wall off here but he actually lets
deservings<00:03:52.889> in<00:03:53.129> a<00:03:53.340> moment<00:03:54.030> of<00:03:54.180> actually

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
deservings in a moment of actually

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.319 
deservings in a moment of actually
because<00:03:55.680> he<00:03:55.769> wasn't<00:03:56.010> careful<00:03:56.370> and<00:03:56.790> all<00:03:57.209> of<00:03:57.239> a

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
because he wasn't careful and all of a

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.420 
because he wasn't careful and all of a
sudden<00:03:57.359> in<00:03:57.659> controlled<00:03:58.109> has<00:03:58.379> a<00:03:58.409> lahzar<00:03:59.010> in<00:03:59.310> his

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
sudden in controlled has a lahzar in his

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.089 
sudden in controlled has a lahzar in his
base<00:03:59.639> and<00:03:59.790> he<00:03:59.879> realizes<00:04:00.359> destiny<00:04:01.019> is<00:04:01.169> doing

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
base and he realizes destiny is doing

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:03.439 
base and he realizes destiny is doing
some<00:04:02.400> kind<00:04:02.609> of<00:04:02.669> all<00:04:02.819> in<00:04:02.940> because<00:04:03.000> you<00:04:03.180> don't

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:03.449 
some kind of all in because you don't

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:04.460 
some kind of all in because you don't
make<00:04:03.599> that<00:04:03.690> Missouri<00:04:04.019> think<00:04:04.199> this<00:04:04.290> really

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
make that Missouri think this really

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.680 
make that Missouri think this really
enough<00:04:04.799> but<00:04:05.519> he<00:04:05.609> can<00:04:05.760> just<00:04:05.940> forfeit<00:04:06.359> the<00:04:06.480> space

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
enough but he can just forfeit the space

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.129 
enough but he can just forfeit the space
that's<00:04:06.959> completely<00:04:07.500> fine<00:04:07.799> in<00:04:08.040> control<00:04:09.139> can

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
that's completely fine in control can

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.050 
that's completely fine in control can
just<00:04:10.349> go<00:04:10.500> to<00:04:10.560> his<00:04:10.680> natural<00:04:10.889> and<00:04:11.370> you<00:04:11.819> know<00:04:11.909> get

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.399 
just go to his natural and you know get
that<00:04:12.209> base<00:04:12.389> set<00:04:12.629> up<00:04:12.720> he<00:04:12.840> still<00:04:13.049> has<00:04:13.229> all<00:04:13.260> his

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:13.409 
that base set up he still has all his

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:14.930

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:23.789 
the main base is gonna fall but like i

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.790 
the main base is gonna fall but like i
said<00:04:23.820> earlier<00:04:24.150> in<00:04:24.479> control<00:04:24.810> is<00:04:24.990> not<00:04:25.620> gonna

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800

oh man Destiny's making how many base

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.950 
oh man Destiny's making how many base
seven<00:04:50.340> banelings<00:04:50.850> and<00:04:51.090> he's<00:04:51.540> actually<00:04:51.690> making

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
seven banelings and he's actually making

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.810 
seven banelings and he's actually making
a<00:04:52.230> lot<00:04:52.410> more<00:04:52.590> now<00:04:52.740> he's<00:04:52.860> making<00:04:52.950> 11<00:04:53.370> banelings

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
a lot more now he's making 11 banelings

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.120 
a lot more now he's making 11 banelings
total<00:04:54.150> so<00:04:54.330> we<00:04:54.780> do<00:04:54.960> sit<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.140> destiny<00:04:55.740> and<00:04:55.950> in

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.130 
total so we do sit a destiny and in

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.030 
total so we do sit a destiny and in
control<00:04:56.310> I<00:04:56.960> mean<00:04:57.960> this<00:04:58.080> is<00:04:58.350> just<00:04:58.380> very<00:04:58.680> unique

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
control I mean this is just very unique

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.560 
control I mean this is just very unique
and<00:04:59.190> controls<00:04:59.580> probably<00:04:59.850> not<00:04:59.970> used<00:05:00.300> to<00:05:00.450> this

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
and controls probably not used to this

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.480 
and controls probably not used to this
but<00:05:00.780> I<00:05:00.960> like<00:05:01.170> how<00:05:01.320> he's<00:05:01.440> responding<00:05:01.980> trying<00:05:02.400> to

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:02.490 
but I like how he's responding trying to

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:04.370 
but I like how he's responding trying to
really<00:05:02.730> make<00:05:03.000> his<00:05:03.180> wall<00:05:03.420> really<00:05:03.900> really<00:05:04.110> tight

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:04.380

here a lot of the main core parts of his
wall<00:05:07.620> have<00:05:07.920> huge<00:05:08.580> hair<00:05:08.820> points<00:05:09.240> of<00:05:09.360> banelings

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
wall have huge hair points of banelings

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.780 
wall have huge hair points of banelings
and<00:05:10.230> here<00:05:10.830> we<00:05:10.860> go<00:05:10.950> and<00:05:11.280> Lillian<00:05:11.550> is<00:05:11.640> it<00:05:11.700> gonna

that's<00:05:21.750> also<00:05:22.050> gonna<00:05:22.169> be<00:05:22.350> a<00:05:22.380> really<00:05:22.620> good<00:05:22.740> trick

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:22.020 
trying to prioritize his pro production

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:23.480 
trying to prioritize his pro production
because<00:06:22.169> he<00:06:22.229> realizes<00:06:22.680> he's<00:06:22.950> just<00:06:23.130> caught<00:06:23.370> in

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
because he realizes he's just caught in

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.490 
because he realizes he's just caught in
a<00:06:23.550> very<00:06:23.729> tough<00:06:23.820> situation<00:06:23.880> now<00:06:24.870> that's<00:06:25.140> a<00:06:25.290> much

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
a very tough situation now that's a much

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.590 
a very tough situation now that's a much
better<00:06:25.530> force<00:06:26.040> field<00:06:26.310> just<00:06:26.520> too<00:06:26.729> yeah<00:06:27.330> that's

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 
better force field just too yeah that's

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.300 
better force field just too yeah that's
a<00:06:27.720> beautiful<00:06:27.960> force<00:06:28.410> field<00:06:28.620> actually<00:06:28.770> so<00:06:29.130> in

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
a beautiful force field actually so in

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.740 
a beautiful force field actually so in
control<00:06:29.490> does<00:06:29.850> know<00:06:30.060> how<00:06:30.300> to<00:06:30.330> throw<00:06:30.720> down

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
control does know how to throw down

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:32.780 
control does know how to throw down
force<00:06:31.140> fields<00:06:31.410> properly<00:06:31.770> I<00:06:31.950> wonder<00:06:32.610> what

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:32.790 
force fields properly I wonder what

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.550 
force fields properly I wonder what
happened<00:06:33.450> there<00:06:33.600> maybe<00:06:33.930> just<00:06:34.080> a<00:06:34.200> slight

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:34.560 
happened there maybe just a slight

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.219 
happened there maybe just a slight
misclick<00:06:35.099> before<00:06:35.490> cannon<00:06:36.360> can<00:06:36.840> happen<00:06:37.050> to<00:06:37.080> the

00:06:37.219 --> 00:06:37.229 
misclick before cannon can happen to the

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:37.830 
misclick before cannon can happen to the
best

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 
best

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.200 
best
it<00:06:38.260> does<00:06:38.500> and<00:06:38.800> you<00:06:39.190> know<00:06:39.250> destiny<00:06:39.699> he<00:06:39.850> still

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:40.210 
it does and you know destiny he still

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.700 
it does and you know destiny he still
follows<00:06:40.660> up<00:06:40.900> with<00:06:40.930> more<00:06:41.199> servings<00:06:41.590> and

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:41.710 
follows up with more servings and

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.590 
follows up with more servings and
banelings<00:06:42.160> in<00:06:42.280> fact<00:06:42.490> he's<00:06:42.610> making<00:06:42.940> nine<00:06:43.210> more

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:43.600 
banelings in fact he's making nine more

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.860 
banelings in fact he's making nine more
and<00:06:44.460> in<00:06:45.460> controls<00:06:45.790> really<00:06:46.060> exposed<00:06:46.479> on<00:06:46.690> his

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:46.870 
and in controls really exposed on his

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:50.100 
and in controls really exposed on his
left<00:06:47.530> side<00:06:47.800> and<00:06:48.520> you<00:06:48.850> know<00:06:48.940> he's<00:06:49.090> he's<00:06:49.330> still

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:50.110 
left side and you know he's he's still

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.830 
left side and you know he's he's still
extremely<00:06:50.740> open<00:06:51.550> to<00:06:51.970> these<00:06:52.180> banelings<00:06:52.720> and<00:06:52.810> I

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
extremely open to these banelings and I

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.580 
extremely open to these banelings and I
don't<00:06:53.020> think<00:06:53.139> he<00:06:53.199> can<00:06:53.290> do<00:06:53.380> anything

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
don't think he can do anything

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:55.590 
don't think he can do anything
essentially<00:06:54.100> can't<00:06:54.370> really<00:06:54.639> force<00:06:54.850> field<00:06:55.150> for

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 
essentially can't really force field for

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:56.820 
essentially can't really force field for
another<00:06:55.780> one<00:06:56.050> second<00:06:56.530> and<00:06:56.590> he's<00:06:56.710> gonna

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
another one second and he's gonna

00:06:56.830 --> 00:06:59.460 
another one second and he's gonna
utilize<00:06:57.130> immediately<00:06:57.850> but<00:06:58.120> I<00:06:58.330> know<00:06:59.110> gosh<00:06:59.290> is

gonna be horrible ooh nice force field

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:05.850 
gonna be horrible ooh nice force field
though<00:07:03.850> but<00:07:04.000> this<00:07:04.210> many<00:07:04.510> banelings<00:07:04.860> there's

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
though but this many banelings there's

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:07.200 
though but this many banelings there's
just<00:07:06.070> not<00:07:06.190> enough<00:07:06.250> stuff<00:07:06.639> out<00:07:06.790> there's<00:07:07.030> only

just not enough stuff out there's only
two<00:07:07.449> cannons<00:07:07.870> left<00:07:08.110> and<00:07:08.320> only<00:07:08.650> one<00:07:08.800> of<00:07:08.889> the

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:08.979 
two cannons left and only one of the

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:10.230 
two cannons left and only one of the
pendants<00:07:09.280> is<00:07:09.340> gonna<00:07:09.520> be<00:07:09.669> able<00:07:09.850> to<00:07:09.910> cover<00:07:10.090> the

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
pendants is gonna be able to cover the

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.090 
pendants is gonna be able to cover the
mineral<00:07:10.540> line<00:07:10.660> oh<00:07:10.840> my<00:07:11.200> god<00:07:11.410> I<00:07:11.440> mean<00:07:11.650> in<00:07:11.770> control

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:12.100 
mineral line oh my god I mean in control

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:14.010 
mineral line oh my god I mean in control
our<00:07:12.280> race<00:07:12.490> senses<00:07:13.000> the<00:07:13.090> fact<00:07:13.300> that<00:07:13.360> his<00:07:13.570> probes

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:14.020 
our race senses the fact that his probes

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:15.690 
our race senses the fact that his probes
are<00:07:14.260> doing<00:07:14.680> this<00:07:14.830> is<00:07:14.979> like<00:07:15.100> a<00:07:15.130> very<00:07:15.460> poor

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:15.700 
are doing this is like a very poor

00:07:15.700 --> 00:07:17.219 
are doing this is like a very poor
horror<00:07:15.910> movie<00:07:16.120> are<00:07:16.240> we<00:07:16.419> sending<00:07:16.630> one<00:07:16.900> probe<00:07:17.110> at

00:07:17.219 --> 00:07:17.229 
horror movie are we sending one probe at

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.440 
horror movie are we sending one probe at
a<00:07:17.290> time<00:07:17.530> here<00:07:17.830> and<00:07:17.979> in<00:07:18.580> control<00:07:18.760> realizes<00:07:19.419> that

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:19.450 
a time here and in control realizes that

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:21.030 
a time here and in control realizes that
that<00:07:19.660> was<00:07:19.990> actually<00:07:20.169> a<00:07:20.350> nice<00:07:20.560> little<00:07:20.710> catch

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:21.040 
that was actually a nice little catch

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.860 
that was actually a nice little catch
there<00:07:21.280> but<00:07:21.760> the<00:07:21.940> probes<00:07:22.210> are<00:07:22.360> fancifully

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:22.870 
there but the probes are fancifully

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:24.090 
there but the probes are fancifully
trying<00:07:23.110> to<00:07:23.169> run<00:07:23.380> a<00:07:23.410> lot<00:07:23.740> of<00:07:23.800> them<00:07:23.889> actually

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:24.100 
trying to run a lot of them actually

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.750 
trying to run a lot of them actually
waste<00:07:24.580> and<00:07:26.280> looks<00:07:27.280> like<00:07:27.370> the<00:07:27.460> rest<00:07:27.580> of<00:07:27.700> the
