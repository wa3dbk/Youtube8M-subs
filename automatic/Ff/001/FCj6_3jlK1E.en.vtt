00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.290
 good this look to begin with I bring a 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.810
 efe style dress that is a brand 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.150
 that supports the foundation that if you buy 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.760
 some garment of sant mark contributes 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.800
 money to the foundation so we were 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.760
 supporting is the dress today I bring some 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.739
 I like little aggressive say that if you 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.280
 I kick someone with these or with 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:32.280
 more weapons 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.170
 karina that water for the very ones of the 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.840
 20 tell me a little bit because you put yourself 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:48.330
 this there I do not know how I always like 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.940
 be different and today as with the 

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:52.560
 eclipse I felt like this very bright air 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.750
 I want to shine 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.850
 so I like these colors that 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.500
 sand are also very fashionable 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:01.090
 roses is that as they soften 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.430
 also very much and at the same time 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.980
 so I like that touch as casual 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.230
 funny but sweet at the same time 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.200
 that's why I decided obviously these shoes 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.840
 that drove me crazy because they are from 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.550
 snake 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.450
 we separated from Carmen all the 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:18.970
 same 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:23.069
 but normally I even have fun 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:23.069
 always with the bag is not much 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.390
 they liked it because we still have more looks 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.069
