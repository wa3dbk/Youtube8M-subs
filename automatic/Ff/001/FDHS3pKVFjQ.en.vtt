00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.490 
diverted the path why have you done that
yeah<00:02:16.160> well<00:02:16.370> it<00:02:16.459> took<00:02:16.610> decision<00:02:17.150> last<00:02:17.959> winter

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
yeah well it took decision last winter

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.640 
yeah well it took decision last winter
to<00:02:18.860> winter<00:02:19.430> just<00:02:20.090> gone<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.450> divert<00:02:20.840> the<00:02:21.440> path

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
to winter just gone to divert the path

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.199 
to winter just gone to divert the path
and<00:02:22.690> because<00:02:23.690> we've<00:02:23.870> been<00:02:24.170> advised<00:02:24.830> that

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:25.209 
and because we've been advised that

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.660 
and because we've been advised that
continual<00:02:26.620> passage<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:27.739> people<00:02:28.069> with<00:02:28.220> feet<00:02:28.489> up

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
continual passage of people with feet up

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.059 
continual passage of people with feet up
and<00:02:28.849> down<00:02:29.000> there<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:29.989> sign<00:02:30.260> was<00:02:30.440> compacting

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
and down there the sign was compacting

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.140 
and down there the sign was compacting
the<00:02:31.099> soil<00:02:31.220> and<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:33.410> therefore<00:02:34.099> would<00:02:34.640> in<00:02:34.940> time

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
the soil and and therefore would in time

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.699 
the soil and and therefore would in time
cause<00:02:35.510> damage<00:02:35.930> to<00:02:35.959> the<00:02:36.140> roofs<00:02:36.319> because<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.650> the

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
cause damage to the roofs because of the

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:42.770 
cause damage to the roofs because of the
lack<00:02:36.860> of<00:02:36.890> beer<00:02:37.130> in<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.370> soil<00:02:37.640> zone

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.480 

so<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.470> probably<00:02:43.740> know<00:02:43.920> your<00:02:44.069> way<00:02:44.220> around<00:02:44.340> the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
so you probably know your way around the

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:46.580 
so you probably know your way around the
garden<00:02:44.819> blindfold<00:02:45.390> but<00:02:45.690> can<00:02:46.110> you<00:02:46.230> tell<00:02:46.440> where

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
garden blindfold but can you tell where

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.860 
garden blindfold but can you tell where
you<00:02:46.680> are<00:02:46.709> by<00:02:46.830> sense<00:02:47.310> of<00:02:47.520> smell<00:02:47.730> certainly<00:02:48.660> can

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
you are by sense of smell certainly can

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.650 
you are by sense of smell certainly can
today<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:50.490> know<00:02:50.580> always<00:02:51.300> on<00:02:51.420> days<00:02:51.630> like

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
today and you know always on days like

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.630 
today and you know always on days like
today<00:02:51.870> this<00:02:52.530> time<00:02:52.800> of<00:02:52.950> year<00:02:52.980> when<00:02:53.310> it's<00:02:53.430> warm

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
today this time of year when it's warm

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.570 
today this time of year when it's warm
sunny<00:02:54.150> and<00:02:54.740> we<00:02:55.740> must<00:02:55.890> be<00:02:56.069> near<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.340> skunk

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
sunny and we must be near the skunk

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.010

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
America and swampy regions of Florida

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.300 
America and swampy regions of Florida
places<00:03:00.900> like<00:03:01.080> that<00:03:01.110> it's<00:03:01.560> pretty<00:03:01.709> swampy<00:03:02.130> here

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
places like that it's pretty swampy here

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.430 
places like that it's pretty swampy here
it<00:03:02.520> is<00:03:02.700> yeah<00:03:02.970> they've<00:03:03.180> adapted<00:03:03.420> really<00:03:04.260> well

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
it is yeah they've adapted really well

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.740 
it is yeah they've adapted really well
here<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.550> suppose<00:03:06.209> they<00:03:06.569> were<00:03:06.630> probably

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
here and I suppose they were probably

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.930 
here and I suppose they were probably
introduced<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.650> the<00:03:07.739> gardens<00:03:08.160> about<00:03:08.489> 60<00:03:08.850> odd

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
introduced to the gardens about 60 odd

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.880 
introduced to the gardens about 60 odd
years<00:03:09.209> ago<00:03:09.420> when<00:03:09.720> Lord<00:03:09.989> fairhaven<00:03:10.590> first

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
years ago when Lord fairhaven first

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:12.979 
years ago when Lord fairhaven first
started<00:03:11.250> developing<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.940> sense<00:03:12.630> of<00:03:12.750> smell

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
started developing the sense of smell

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:19.509 
started developing the sense of smell
woodland<00:03:13.410> yeah<00:03:13.830> yeah<00:03:14.430> that's<00:03:14.760> well<00:03:15.060> yeah<00:03:15.330> ah

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:22.190 

rhododendron<00:03:20.519> looks<00:03:20.730> nice<00:03:20.970> yeah<00:03:21.780> this<00:03:21.989> is

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
rhododendron looks nice yeah this is

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.490 
rhododendron looks nice yeah this is
usually<00:03:22.980> one<00:03:23.340> of<00:03:23.370> the<00:03:23.489> first<00:03:23.820> that<00:03:24.120> flowers<00:03:24.630> in

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
usually one of the first that flowers in

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.350 
usually one of the first that flowers in
the<00:03:25.709> year<00:03:25.980> a<00:03:26.160> little<00:03:26.580> bit<00:03:26.790> later<00:03:27.000> this<00:03:27.300> year

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
spring and so one of the early varieties

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.070 
spring and so one of the early varieties
in<00:03:32.310> the<00:03:32.430> garden<00:03:32.790> there's<00:03:33.060> two<00:03:33.269> or<00:03:33.360> three<00:03:33.569> sort

of clumps around and but surrounded by

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.199 
of clumps around and but surrounded by
other<00:03:37.380> varieties<00:03:38.190> which<00:03:38.489> will<00:03:38.700> come<00:03:38.910> out<00:03:39.030> of

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
other varieties which will come out of

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.120 
other varieties which will come out of
various<00:03:39.569> stages<00:03:39.840> over<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.410> next<00:03:40.709> sort<00:03:40.920> to
