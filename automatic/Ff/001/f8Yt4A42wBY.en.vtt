00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.989
 good idea 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.210
 I started immediately he is hyper breast clubs and understood it is 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.150
 we have and that the city this superb game 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.680
 facebook was released just a month ago and it's a big box so 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.220
 now% and so you have you understood that you need to tickle 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.880
 but that it was difficult can he sign with the keys inside 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.200
 these free and open source which I could have targeted trichet for the 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.840
 scene more to use also 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.510
 he told me the first time that percent and you will need it for them 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.000
 to cheat 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.340
 e 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.149
 what to do if I'm still going to try it works 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.189
 we just suffered a little technical inconvenience about facebook toilets but 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.359
 rest assured nothing serious do not panic we are always present this is 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:22.969
 simply alstom if the p'tite there is one that took off at 1gb uses this word 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:24.240
 excuse me 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.980
 relaxed 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.620
 the test simply the mouse that no longer answered the doubt the most 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:30.030
 possibility of cheating 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.770
 given that we will build 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.320
 solid foundations 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.409
 to rebuild a beautiful tutorial I could not venture 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.229
 further I had to put an end to the race to the previous video for 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.000
 ascend 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.190
 for this part 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.380
 so let's go 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.130
 happy to show how are we cheating so I go first so go 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.650
 the impossibility of such here 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.409
 So here is basic céline club 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.310
 ok I wonder how it works 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.630
 so you happen like that you go in found beheaded 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.800
 to the right 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.560
 you will buy 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.999
 in the goal it is very clearly to earn money 

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:06.149
 for 100 euros 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.350
 but in fact we are going 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.429
 concerned about objects that we will be able to sell 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.429
 and we're going to have a hundred items to sell and so what strikes us 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:16.789
 nothing less if you do not know if it is the payment of $ 150 per object that 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:21.120
 get back so it goes down 250 times that's twenty-five thousand and you can 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:25.579
 repeat the operation as many times as you want so the net is 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.930
 potentially can occupy and 5 million 5 million dollars in 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.219
 the goal of difference and everything depends on the time after you will grant I 

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.510
 start again without delay to make me this demonstration then I will 

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:39.539
 take for example this shelf I've spent years 

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:43.049
 times here I make room a difficult second time than before prostate 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:45.409
 it's the same for the English four 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.039
 pope any 

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:49.149
 here they will be fine here 

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:52.289
 that's fine now what I'm doing I'm going into the tories 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:55.899
 and I will return his four objects 

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:06.039
 to me from their debt a trick here 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:08.909
 because I had three hours 

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:12.530
 here I was looking forward to four tables and here we had four as well and as we 

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:15.889
 will accuse of city-dwellers I did not want it to have everything from city to city 

00:03:15.889 --> 00:03:19.150
 values ​​tumbling a bad no need to do what I did not panic 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:25.629
 I will go in titanic immediately very simply Thursday bis hop 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:31.090
 always this little beast blinking 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.640
 here we have to go double click on what makes us appear the 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.709
 process of simply you have to take the window that does not fit 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.620
 cursed the pair force recognizes by its small logo 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.620
 so that way we do not ask any question it's really simple 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.009
 double click on it 

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:50.469
 So now what must be done 

00:03:50.469 --> 00:03:55.329
 we came back we went out at the table i go back on a catalyst site so it takes 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.219
 make 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:57.850
 he was at table 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.600
 you have neither more nor less than to enter the number 4 below the bayou 

00:04:02.729 --> 00:04:05.719
 and then then bankruptcy has been rarely it's mostly not to have been 

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:08.209
 from our side also you happen nothing else to do 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.469
 I click erste cannes 

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:14.959
 I had some comments that people were having trouble following utoeya 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.090
 and I will do my best, believe me 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.829
 I'm trying to be clear after the draw 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:21.199
 as clear as possible 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:25.190
 % the stopping of the series loses five places normally it should not have any 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.160
 problem if you have any, do not hesitate to contact us 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:31.690

 so here we go in the es4 moyer that the flat south majors simply 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.370
 there are only three 

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.039
 what I hope is I'm going to do I'm going to get three here 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.430
 and I hope that with this framework what will bring us the values ​​here 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.229
 always the same it is always there the same strategy one then skims 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.330
 that here I did on the three days I'm over two years old 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.569
 I do the same in 2006 and I do nextag 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.419
 expensive value journeys it's great because we have more than two 

00:04:57.419 --> 00:05:00.150
 tables so what to do is their passion here 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.759
 pop i get in 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.129

 boubou rolls leave them he will appear downstairs on this line 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.820
 but if you are 4 m then we had to leave the small body 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.120
 It's not more complicated than that 

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:22.980
 and instead of May 1st was 9999 and we will see 99 table 

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:25.500
 right here 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:28.500
 you will be left with a table 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.870

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:41.470
 $ 5000 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.389
 here we do not do buried 

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:46.900
 okay well I will not do it indefinitely because for them 

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.340
 it's not worth veiling the principle I play very convincingly the east side 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.340
 dollars 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:58.680
 and that's so it works perfectly 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.669
 e yes do it indefinitely 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:04.159
 worse and then that's all 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:05.159
