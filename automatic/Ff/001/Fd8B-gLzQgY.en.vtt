00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.460
 Hello ladies and gentlemen of the 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.030
 games here praises 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.429
 It's okay that you're good because I'm 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.529
 seeing the difference in the person 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.930
 that another person is not I am 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.029
 Landim still only that the team took photos 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.880
 for my graduation for the invitation of 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.380
 graduation so I've come so we have 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.359
 videos and vote so the video does not 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.160
 I would vote depending on the subject but I 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.019
 I know the subject I wanted to tell you about. 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.079
 your team but I need to talk about this 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:37.200
 Man, I need to talk about this because I 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.040
 I find it very bizarrely ridiculous that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.550
 is happening 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.870
 a lot of people have seen the video of the crown 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.090
 big and cushion where I talk about 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.980
 final on the final acrid smell that 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.829
 took me by surprise because I 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.649
 was not feeling finning of the thing and 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.270
 if you have no idea what I am 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.059
 talking about the end of the night when you 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.219
 not watched're watching guy is 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.070
 watch the first whole whole series 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.989
 after watching the mythical I did, right from the end 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.290
 of the year after this video exists 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.250
 is a reflection of the final data of the 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.189
 run right 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.220
 so it's a very curious thing that 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:17.189
 some people are not understanding 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.549
 the order of leather law and this 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.780
 repeated in the disclosure that in addition to 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.439
 run the first and second seasons 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.939
 are confirmed will be passed on sbt 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:32.460
 in burundi the company finally fucks 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.860
 cool and cool tv open design that 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.430
 long time we had not seen a 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.310
 Drawing after a long time is them 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.140
 another put other programs in the 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.810
 range and take away the problems of 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.689
 drawing what I think this very beige 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.869
 but it is about another video denounced besides 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.409
 thigh that when announced it would have 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:02:00.240
 as well as casting as part of the 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:04.439
 grade have reported some portals 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:08.160
 have reported the addition of run by the party 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:12.819
 which was controversial, which was the final and 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.459
 ended up commenting on the ending and 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.349
 letting it run as if it were a 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.349
 deviation in yuri this improvement 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.709
 and it is not to go to those who do not know who 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.140
 in yuri i there is a culture of who 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.489
 assists in half and otto drawings with 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.660
 gay theme 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.940
 yuri are lesbian-themed drawings and 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:44.090
 besides Cuba does not have this thematic the 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.610
 focus is not on the subject by a chance they 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.150
 decided to develop something in the 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:53.180
 last season still on the fourth that I 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.769
 I did not notice a model too many people. 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.400
 surprise with this end 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:03:01.160
 and the end is not magic at all 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.040
 but let's say the cup on the open tv of 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.830
 a child we have nothing to do 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.920
 one thing with the other is a year and a half 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:14.390
 which speaks of the relations between people 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:16.549
 about the connection of avatars and everything 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.019
 more to the story of the journey of 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:22.280
 run afn the focus is on animation and with 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:27.019
 This I miss 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.450
 the journey of the race as beauty avatar 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.329
 not so much that each season has a 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.609
 central theme in the case 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:36.530
 if she turned out to be a character 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.660
 main a lesbian character I did 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.390
 part of the investment swearing more 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.609
 not the focus of the business so much 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.640
 people are already twisting their noses with 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:48.560
 series because it is a series that hurts 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:51.680
 I do not die, people do not 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.930
 and even if it was a series of themes 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.500
 half yuri 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.290
 I do not see anything much but if there is 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:02.690
 It's already a very, very catchy thing. 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:05.840
 scale 4 do not also put these things 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.540
 in the morning in an independent of the 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.560
 objective of the animal segment and 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:14.630
 yuri is straight and look what I 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.049
 I mean, do we have this controversy? 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:20.180
 around mat match because 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.120
 it's an animation that does not have anything more 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:27.350
 and that treats the sexuality of the crown of 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:30.410
 very subtle way too subtle is not 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.580
 the focus has been the focus is the 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.460
 character 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.500
 your self discovery with avatar 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.890
 by chance they want to develop 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.920
 at the end of the 45 of the last time I 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:46.070
 caught by surprise this beauty the rain 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.380
 I liked the courage, I just think it should. 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.270
 have had another day to develop 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.290
 a better way, as I said in the 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.240
 past video 

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:55.820
 if you take a look I still carry on 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.800
 with the same opinion but I do not think 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:58.940
 besides things be a drawing in heat 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.730
 morning pursuit drawing 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.350
 super cool as per the battle in the 

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:05.450
 truth the series of a series avatar 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.980
 It's very cool, some people think 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.750
 still happens but to say that besides 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.390
 diana and everything else but they are issues 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:13.460
 of the series of script more mas 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.500
 I think together the franchise avatar 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.630
 very cool of very teachings 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:22.100
 Nice and I do not see anything else this 

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:24.880
 People my sky god killing himself 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:27.050
 It's very fresh and there's something else. 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.090
 I want to warn you that I'm talking 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.850
 this is not a majority is not the 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.860
 majority still knew that 

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:36.230
 did not you know you know what the fuck is a series 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.450
 and not offensive because I think there is in the 

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:40.400
 the way the news was spread from the 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:43.190
 unhappy series 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.990
 the series she has much more to show 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:50.360
 that only the end that the end by chance 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:55.790
 the controversial a little bad and bad news 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:59.060
 distributed poorly with one with final 

00:05:55.790 --> 00:06:01.160
 controversial then think that it would be a 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:04.250
 something else and has nothing to do with 

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.490
 beginning of the series and then I know that 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.470
 Most do not think it does not think that the 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.310
 law is now running and running at 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:17.330
 even know that the goal would be another 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:22.090
 but for those who think that the goal of 

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:24.110
 series is a value of life if it were not 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.120
 there would be no problem 

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:28.669
 I just wanted my last hour 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:30.979
 as well as any animation that has 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:33.020
 and stuff like that 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:34.700
 I think after that it should not be 

00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:37.400
 past the open tv or should be 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.840
 spent a lot of time predicts that the 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:41.090
 first of the band né 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:45.680
 in fact my fear I can not speak to that 

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:47.630
 band had predicted r team at last that was 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:48.529
 My opinion if you are in the 

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.019
 belief of faith 

00:06:48.529 --> 00:06:53.209
 if I have the same opinion the 

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:55.639
 comments to agree to express 

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:57.949
 but remembering with respect to beauty the 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:59.779
 People, I 'm going to stay here and I 'll wait. 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:01.909

00:07:03.499 --> 00:07:07.189
 register 

00:07:04.309 --> 00:07:09.709
 the guy spoke of games animation 

00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:11.869
