00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
is working on yesterday but six-speed

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.250 
is working on yesterday but six-speed
transmission<00:04:31.670> and<00:04:32.390> how<00:04:32.540> does<00:04:32.600> this<00:04:32.810> feel<00:04:33.020> on

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
transmission and how does this feel on

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.310 
transmission and how does this feel on
the<00:04:33.380> highway<00:04:33.800> this<00:04:34.490> six<00:04:35.210> speeding<00:04:35.600> off<00:04:35.780> or<00:04:36.110> not

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320 
the highway this six speeding off or not

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.710 
the highway this six speeding off or not
enough<00:04:36.650> it's<00:04:37.250> not<00:04:37.340> enough<00:04:37.400> a<00:04:37.940> militia<00:04:38.270> to

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
enough it's not enough a militia to

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.450 
enough it's not enough a militia to
seven<00:04:40.060> so<00:04:41.060> it's<00:04:41.360> torquey<00:04:41.750> a<00:04:42.230> lot<00:04:42.620> of<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:43.040> the

fun<00:04:44.840> factor<00:04:45.350> of<00:04:45.500> this<00:04:45.680> car<00:04:45.950> is<00:04:46.190> in<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.550> gearing

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:47.180 
fun factor of this car is in the gearing

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.360 
fun factor of this car is in the gearing
is<00:04:47.360> pretty<00:04:47.600> short<00:04:47.900> so<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:48.770> go<00:04:49.100> through<00:04:49.280> the

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
is pretty short so you go through the

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.070 
is pretty short so you go through the
gears<00:04:49.700> and<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.150> feel<00:04:50.330> like<00:04:50.480> you<00:04:50.600> really<00:04:50.750> take

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
gears and you feel like you really take

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.590 
gears and you feel like you really take
it<00:04:51.260> off<00:04:51.440> but<00:04:51.800> once<00:04:52.010> you<00:04:52.130> get<00:04:52.310> up<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.730> speed<00:04:53.510> you

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
it off but once you get up to speed you

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.600 
it off but once you get up to speed you
know<00:04:53.720> highway<00:04:54.080> speeds<00:04:54.470> it<00:04:54.950> feels<00:04:55.220> like<00:04:55.400> it's

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:55.610 
know highway speeds it feels like it's

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.159 
know highway speeds it feels like it's
not<00:04:55.850> quite<00:04:55.910> enough<00:04:56.300> so<00:04:56.480> at<00:04:56.690> least<00:04:56.840> it<00:04:57.020> is<00:04:57.140> a

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
not quite enough so at least it is a

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:59.860 
not quite enough so at least it is a
six-speed<00:04:57.770> so<00:04:57.950> that's<00:04:58.130> cool<00:04:58.419> to<00:04:59.419> open<00:04:59.780> the

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
six-speed so that's cool to open the

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.600 
six-speed so that's cool to open the
hood<00:05:00.050> on<00:05:00.350> this<00:05:00.530> one<00:05:00.740> or<00:05:00.860> any<00:05:00.919> other<00:05:01.070> one<00:05:01.280> you

hood on this one or any other one you

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.820 
hood on this one or any other one you
got<00:05:01.760> to<00:05:01.880> get<00:05:02.000> on<00:05:02.150> this<00:05:02.960> little<00:05:03.140> gap<00:05:03.470> that's

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:03.830 
got to get on this little gap that's

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.130 
got to get on this little gap that's
between<00:05:04.160> the<00:05:04.430> headlight<00:05:04.850> where<00:05:05.660> my<00:05:05.780> index

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:06.140 
between the headlight where my index

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:08.200 
between the headlight where my index
finger<00:05:06.560> is<00:05:06.740> I'm<00:05:07.100> pushing<00:05:07.640> on<00:05:07.760> that<00:05:08.000> little

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
finger is I'm pushing on that little

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.540 
finger is I'm pushing on that little
yellow<00:05:08.450> tab<00:05:08.870> and<00:05:09.590> that<00:05:09.620> gets<00:05:10.040> you<00:05:10.190> in<00:05:10.310> the<00:05:10.400> hood

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
yellow tab and that gets you in the hood

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:12.820 
yellow tab and that gets you in the hood
one<00:05:11.240> of<00:05:11.360> the<00:05:11.450> damn<00:05:11.690> things<00:05:12.050> of<00:05:12.230> this<00:05:12.380> is<00:05:12.590> that

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
got it on the air filter box so one

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.430 
got it on the air filter box so one
other<00:05:21.800> thing<00:05:22.070> that's<00:05:22.280> on<00:05:22.520> the<00:05:22.729> intercooler

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
other thing that's on the intercooler

but the little weather stripping or

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.590 
but the little weather stripping or
whatever<00:05:27.860> just<00:05:28.400> barks<00:05:28.760> that<00:05:29.030> all<00:05:29.210> up<00:05:29.450> and

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.600 
whatever just barks that all up and

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.600 
whatever just barks that all up and
makes<00:05:29.840> it<00:05:29.990> look<00:05:30.140> not<00:05:30.380> nice<00:05:30.650> and<00:05:31.220> that's<00:05:31.370> not

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:31.610 
makes it look not nice and that's not

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.340 
makes it look not nice and that's not
just<00:05:31.669> gives<00:05:32.060> it<00:05:32.120> a<00:05:32.240> poem<00:05:32.510> but<00:05:32.750> you<00:05:32.870> get<00:05:33.020> dust

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350 
just gives it a poem but you get dust

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.250 
just gives it a poem but you get dust
and<00:05:33.650> dirt<00:05:33.890> and<00:05:33.950> grit<00:05:34.400> because<00:05:35.090> it's<00:05:35.479> a<00:05:35.660> ram<00:05:35.990> air

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.260 
and dirt and grit because it's a ram air

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.170 
and dirt and grit because it's a ram air
you<00:05:36.740> know<00:05:36.860> it<00:05:36.979> goes<00:05:37.190> in<00:05:37.400> through<00:05:37.610> the<00:05:37.700> hood<00:05:37.940> a

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:38.180 
you know it goes in through the hood a

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.080 
you know it goes in through the hood a
little<00:05:38.660> scoop<00:05:38.990> on<00:05:39.169> it<00:05:39.380> to<00:05:39.950> get<00:05:40.130> every<00:05:40.760> kind<00:05:40.940> of

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
little scoop on it to get every kind of

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.940 
little scoop on it to get every kind of
debris<00:05:41.450> and<00:05:41.660> dirt<00:05:41.870> this<00:05:42.200> basically<00:05:42.680> gets

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
debris and dirt this basically gets

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.650 
debris and dirt this basically gets
every<00:05:43.190> bit<00:05:43.340> as<00:05:43.430> dirty<00:05:43.640> as<00:05:43.790> an<00:05:43.910> air<00:05:44.090> filter<00:05:44.300> does

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
every bit as dirty as an air filter does

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:46.900 
every bit as dirty as an air filter does
and<00:05:44.930> then<00:05:45.530> it<00:05:45.680> just<00:05:45.860> kind<00:05:46.100> of<00:05:46.160> barks<00:05:46.460> that<00:05:46.700> up

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
and then it just kind of barks that up

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:47.740 
and then it just kind of barks that up
and<00:05:47.180> makes<00:05:47.419> it

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
and makes it

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:52.870 
and makes it
kind<00:05:48.020> of<00:05:48.110> rough<00:05:50.620> this<00:05:51.620> one<00:05:51.890> still<00:05:52.430> has<00:05:52.610> a<00:05:52.640> good

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:52.880 
kind of rough this one still has a good

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.220 
kind of rough this one still has a good
AC<00:05:53.090> compressor<00:05:53.570> so<00:05:54.080> really<00:05:54.920> proud<00:05:55.160> of<00:05:55.370> it<00:05:56.230> and

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
AC compressor so really proud of it and

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:59.830 
AC compressor so really proud of it and
this<00:05:57.380> is<00:05:57.440> where<00:05:57.740> your<00:05:57.920> AC<00:05:58.220> tag<00:05:58.730> is<00:05:59.030> one<00:05:59.660> of<00:05:59.780> the

00:05:59.830 --> 00:05:59.840

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:01.760 
most common things for these cars to

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.970 
most common things for these cars to
encounter<00:06:02.330> is<00:06:02.390> to<00:06:02.600> have<00:06:02.780> this<00:06:03.050> radiator

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
encounter is to have this radiator

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.790 
encounter is to have this radiator
support<00:06:04.280> that<00:06:04.880> goes<00:06:05.030> all<00:06:05.240> the<00:06:05.270> way<00:06:05.480> down<00:06:05.800> this

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 
support that goes all the way down this

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.200 
support that goes all the way down this
is<00:06:06.980> the<00:06:07.010> one<00:06:07.190> that<00:06:07.370> I<00:06:07.430> showed<00:06:07.670> in<00:06:07.790> service

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:08.210 
is the one that I showed in service

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:09.820 
is the one that I showed in service
position<00:06:08.690> and<00:06:08.840> that<00:06:08.900> other<00:06:09.110> video<00:06:09.470> on<00:06:09.530> that

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 
position and that other video on that

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.320 
position and that other video on that
are<00:06:10.130> 52<00:06:11.110> but<00:06:12.110> basically<00:06:13.040> these<00:06:13.610> get<00:06:13.910> replaced

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:14.330 
are 52 but basically these get replaced

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.620 
are 52 but basically these get replaced
and<00:06:14.780> then<00:06:15.110> once<00:06:15.350> you<00:06:15.440> put<00:06:15.470> a<00:06:15.650> new<00:06:15.860> one<00:06:15.890> in<00:06:16.630> then

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
and then once you put a new one in then

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:20.590 
and then once you put a new one in then
it<00:06:17.780> doesn't<00:06:18.080> have<00:06:18.290> the<00:06:18.530> AC<00:06:18.710> tag<00:06:19.220> so<00:06:20.090> the<00:06:20.300> charge

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
it doesn't have the AC tag so the charge

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.510 
it doesn't have the AC tag so the charge
is<00:06:20.690> really<00:06:21.170> small<00:06:21.560> on<00:06:21.590> this<00:06:22.100> it's<00:06:22.490> only<00:06:24.130> 0.9<00:06:25.130> t1
