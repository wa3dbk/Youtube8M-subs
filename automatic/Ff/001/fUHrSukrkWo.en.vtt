won't get the lighter fluid taste in it
what<00:02:18.730> I<00:02:18.760> like<00:02:18.970> to<00:02:19.090> do<00:02:19.239> is<00:02:19.420> I'll<00:02:19.569> use<00:02:19.599> about<00:02:20.049> a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
what I like to do is I'll use about a

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.430 
what I like to do is I'll use about a
quarter<00:02:20.470> bottle<00:02:20.650> depending<00:02:21.160> how<00:02:21.280> much<00:02:21.430> of

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
quarter bottle depending how much of

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.620 
quarter bottle depending how much of
charcoal<00:02:23.440> I<00:02:23.530> have<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:25.000> charcoal<00:02:25.359> right<00:02:25.480> here

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630 
charcoal I have this charcoal right here

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:26.940 
charcoal I have this charcoal right here
that<00:02:25.750> I<00:02:25.780> have<00:02:25.840> right<00:02:26.079> here<00:02:26.109> should<00:02:26.530> be<00:02:26.680> enough

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
that I have right here should be enough

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.069 
that I have right here should be enough
once<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.280> see<00:02:27.459> it<00:02:27.519> turning<00:02:28.510> width<00:02:28.810> right

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:29.079 
once you see it turning width right

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:31.440 
once you see it turning width right
there<00:02:29.319> you<00:02:30.280> should<00:02:30.340> be<00:02:30.549> pretty<00:02:30.730> much<00:02:30.850> good<00:02:31.209> and

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
there you should be pretty much good and

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.349 
there you should be pretty much good and
set<00:02:31.720> what<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.739> like<00:02:32.950> to<00:02:33.099> do<00:02:33.190> is<00:02:33.310> to<00:02:33.519> let<00:02:33.819> it<00:02:33.880> sit<00:02:34.329> a

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
set what I like to do is to let it sit a

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.990 
set what I like to do is to let it sit a
little<00:02:34.720> bit<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.319> they<00:02:35.500> can<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.709> soak<00:02:36.639> in<00:02:36.670> the

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
little bit so they can a soak in the

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.360 
little bit so they can a soak in the
lighter<00:02:37.180> fluid<00:02:37.389> into<00:02:37.750> the<00:02:37.780> actual<00:02:38.370> charcoal

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
lighter fluid into the actual charcoal

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.300 
lighter fluid into the actual charcoal
itself<00:02:39.730> because<00:02:40.359> if<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.599> just<00:02:41.190> put<00:02:42.190> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
itself because if you just put the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:43.860 
itself because if you just put the
lighter<00:02:42.489> fluid<00:02:42.639> on<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.060> then<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.299> spark<00:02:43.720> it

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
lighter fluid on and then you spark it

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.220 
lighter fluid on and then you spark it
up

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
up

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:45.930 
up
what<00:02:44.349> happens<00:02:44.739> is<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.099> didn't<00:02:45.310> let<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.579> soak

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
what happens is you didn't let it soak

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.020 
what happens is you didn't let it soak
into<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.419> actual<00:02:46.720> charcoal<00:02:47.200> so<00:02:47.500> if<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.700> fires

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
into the actual charcoal so if the fires

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.490 
into the actual charcoal so if the fires
going<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.329> turn<00:02:49.480> off<00:02:49.630> on<00:02:49.810> your<00:02:49.930> like<00:02:50.079> really

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.190 
going to turn off on your like really
quick<00:02:50.739> so<00:02:51.730> by<00:02:51.880> letting<00:02:52.120> it<00:02:52.209> set<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.750> helps<00:02:53.019> out

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
quick so by letting it set it helps out

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.599 
quick so by letting it set it helps out
with<00:02:53.440> with<00:02:53.980> a<00:02:54.010> lasting<00:02:54.549> laughing<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.150> longer

but he does are kind of tricky sometimes
like<00:02:59.919> I<00:03:00.010> was<00:03:00.130> saying<00:03:00.340> a<00:03:00.430> minute<00:03:00.700> ago<00:03:01.919> depending

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:02.919 
like I was saying a minute ago depending

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.690 
like I was saying a minute ago depending
on<00:03:03.040> the<00:03:03.160> cut<00:03:03.400> that<00:03:03.549> you<00:03:03.609> have<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:05.709> skirts<00:03:06.069> you

on the cut that you have the skirts you

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.770 
on the cut that you have the skirts you
want<00:03:06.880> to<00:03:06.970> look<00:03:07.150> at<00:03:07.329> them<00:03:07.480> when<00:03:07.630> you're

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
want to look at them when you're

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.680 
want to look at them when you're
choosing<00:03:08.230> them<00:03:08.639> look<00:03:09.639> at<00:03:09.760> the<00:03:09.880> packs<00:03:10.150> most<00:03:10.540> of

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
choosing them look at the packs most of

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.420 
choosing them look at the packs most of
the<00:03:10.750> time<00:03:11.019> they'll<00:03:11.530> always<00:03:11.739> hide<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.190> fat

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
the time they'll always hide the fat

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.099 
the time they'll always hide the fat
part<00:03:12.700> towards<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.090> bottom<00:03:13.269> everything<00:03:13.630> clean

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
part towards the bottom everything clean

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:16.259 
part towards the bottom everything clean
them<00:03:14.260> off<00:03:14.440> take<00:03:15.220> that<00:03:15.370> memory<00:03:15.579> that<00:03:15.790> I'm<00:03:16.000> going

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:16.269 
them off take that memory that I'm going

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.059 
them off take that memory that I'm going
to<00:03:16.329> put<00:03:16.450> off<00:03:16.630> of<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.410> you<00:03:17.680> should<00:03:17.889> have<00:03:18.010> a

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.069 
to put off of it and you should have a

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.740 
to put off of it and you should have a
good<00:03:18.519> backup<00:03:18.940> also<00:03:19.510> a<00:03:19.690> little

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
good backup also a little

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.300 
good backup also a little
what<00:03:21.050> makes<00:03:21.380> a<00:03:21.500> big<00:03:21.680> difference<00:03:21.980> is<00:03:22.100> the<00:03:22.190> way

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
what makes a big difference is the way

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.520 
what makes a big difference is the way
that<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.580> cut<00:03:22.850> them<00:03:23.000> if<00:03:23.660> you<00:03:23.870> have<00:03:24.050> the<00:03:24.230> skirt

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
that you cut them if you have the skirt

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:26.610 
that you cut them if you have the skirt
coming<00:03:24.590> out<00:03:25.040> like<00:03:25.160> this<00:03:25.340> and<00:03:25.610> you<00:03:25.670> have<00:03:25.910> the

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
coming out like this and you have the

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.950 
coming out like this and you have the
way<00:03:27.620> that<00:03:27.650> we<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.190> or<00:03:28.550> is<00:03:28.640> vertical<00:03:29.420> it<00:03:29.480> is<00:03:29.690> what

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
way that we is or is vertical it is what

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.270 
way that we is or is vertical it is what
you<00:03:30.110> want<00:03:30.320> to<00:03:30.410> do<00:03:30.530> is<00:03:30.650> you<00:03:30.770> want<00:03:30.950> to<00:03:30.980> cut<00:03:31.190> it

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
you want to do is you want to cut it

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.220 
you want to do is you want to cut it
horizontal<00:03:31.970> don't<00:03:32.300> cut<00:03:32.540> it<00:03:32.660> vertical<00:03:33.140> with

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
horizontal don't cut it vertical with

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.930 
horizontal don't cut it vertical with
meat<00:03:33.560> strands<00:03:34.130> the<00:03:34.280> way<00:03:34.400> that<00:03:34.580> they're<00:03:34.730> going

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
meat strands the way that they're going

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.090 
meat strands the way that they're going
across<00:03:35.240> this<00:03:35.630> way<00:03:35.840> because<00:03:36.410> then<00:03:36.680> you<00:03:36.860> end<00:03:37.010> up

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
across this way because then you end up

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.560 
across this way because then you end up
getting<00:03:37.280> the<00:03:37.459> strands<00:03:37.910> of<00:03:38.000> meat<00:03:38.209> and<00:03:38.420> it's

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:38.570 
getting the strands of meat and it's

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:40.270 
getting the strands of meat and it's
hard<00:03:38.810> to<00:03:38.870> actually<00:03:39.080> try<00:03:39.560> to<00:03:39.620> break<00:03:39.890> them<00:03:40.070> off

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
hard to actually try to break them off

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.550 
hard to actually try to break them off
and<00:03:40.490> eat<00:03:40.610> it<00:03:40.790> if<00:03:41.330> you<00:03:41.390> cut<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:41.690> horizontal<00:03:42.380> then
