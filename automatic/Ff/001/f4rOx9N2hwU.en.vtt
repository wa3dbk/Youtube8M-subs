 and in the forest the group of 10 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.190
 completely apart 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.160
 we are looking for the first in this group 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:54.989

 sit there as towards the beach 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.210
 walk and then men are already 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.500
 seen sloppy from the beach 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:16.020

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.549

 and there is a front-runner for erwin harmes 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.070
 from Middelburg has the naughty shoes 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.409
 attracted and do something against it 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.299
 all coastal marathon rules are in violation 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.299
 in the lead so early in the race 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.530

 for the women it is leonie ton 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.369
 too soon they must release in this group 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.960
 here in the black of ash run hard 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.960
 man in yellow agnes skipper 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:59.510

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.650

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.230
 Middelburg 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.020
 el ouazizi then just step aside 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:11.880
 probably for a sanitary stop 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.380
 and these men pass the 10 km plan 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.390
 always have many spectators 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.390
 like today along the entire route 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.660
 that will be the fast course 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.620
 harmen demolished his own match he 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.850
 wants to end the top three and still dream 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.870
 of more 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.870
 but the question is whether that will work 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.200
 hopeful time in the match note 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.790

 lost him too much and will follow 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.270
 would do too little head work 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.270
 two years of actually arguing 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:50.310

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.360
 He must already get off the Veerse Gatdam 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.360

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.709
 it is well 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.710
 the following group then falls out 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.120
 each other 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:12.370

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.400
 at the beach between woman one 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.750
