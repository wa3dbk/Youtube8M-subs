00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
can see to stop his flippers from

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.590 
can see to stop his flippers from
warping<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:02.860> Papo<00:01:03.670> quite<00:01:03.940> often<00:01:04.119> do<00:01:04.420> this

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
warping and Papo quite often do this

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.749 
warping and Papo quite often do this
with<00:01:04.780> their<00:01:04.930> dinosaurs<00:01:05.500> now<00:01:06.159> with<00:01:06.340> this<00:01:06.490> one

with their dinosaurs now with this one
it<00:01:07.090> serves<00:01:07.420> quite<00:01:07.780> nice<00:01:08.049> nicely<00:01:08.500> as<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:09.189> display

world
it's<00:01:56.469> interesting<00:01:56.709> to<00:01:57.039> note<00:01:57.069> because<00:01:57.399> you

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
it's interesting to note because you

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.340 
it's interesting to note because you
quite<00:01:57.700> often<00:01:57.850> see<00:01:58.179> them<00:01:58.299> pictured<00:01:58.689> in<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:59.079> both

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
quite often see them pictured in in both

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.050 
quite often see them pictured in in both
variations<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.429> might<00:02:00.609> think<00:02:00.639> that

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
variations and you might think that

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.550 
variations and you might think that
maybe<00:02:01.209> the<00:02:01.420> sculpt<00:02:01.779> was<00:02:01.990> wrong<00:02:02.229> on<00:02:02.409> this<00:02:02.499> one

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
maybe the sculpt was wrong on this one

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.399 
maybe the sculpt was wrong on this one
but<00:02:02.889> it's<00:02:03.009> not<00:02:03.219> it's<00:02:03.729> actually<00:02:04.179> the<00:02:04.659> the<00:02:05.259> more

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
but it's not it's actually the the more

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.210 
but it's not it's actually the the more
predatory<00:02:05.969> version<00:02:06.969> of<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.270> plays<00:02:07.569> yes<00:02:07.810> or<00:02:08.220> so

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
actually this looks very similar to the

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.480 
actually this looks very similar to the
skin<00:03:34.860> of<00:03:35.010> a<00:03:35.100> whale<00:03:35.660> or<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.720> dolphin<00:03:37.250> it's<00:03:38.250> almost

like<00:03:38.700> these<00:03:38.850> little<00:03:39.420> imperfections<00:03:40.170> on<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.380> an

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
like these little imperfections on a an

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.760 
like these little imperfections on a an
otherwise<00:03:41.370> perfect<00:03:42.060> surface<00:03:42.440> so<00:03:43.440> it's<00:03:43.560> mainly

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:43.770 
otherwise perfect surface so it's mainly

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:45.230 
otherwise perfect surface so it's mainly
smooth<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.610> then<00:03:44.700> it's<00:03:44.820> just<00:03:44.910> got<00:03:45.090> these

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:45.240 
smooth and then it's just got these

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.970 
smooth and then it's just got these
little<00:03:45.570> striations<00:03:46.230> all<00:03:46.410> over<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:46.740> place

little striations all over the place

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.740 
little striations all over the place
which<00:03:47.700> i<00:03:47.820> think<00:03:47.880> is<00:03:48.150> really<00:03:48.330> good<00:03:48.570> they've

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
which i think is really good they've

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.230 
which i think is really good they've
obviously<00:03:48.870> referenced<00:03:49.670> natural<00:03:50.670> history<00:03:51.030> for

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.240 
obviously referenced natural history for

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:54.830 
obviously referenced natural history for
that<00:03:52.670> there's<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.700> nice<00:03:53.850> contrast<00:03:54.330> of<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.660> blue

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
that there's a nice contrast of the blue

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.530 
that there's a nice contrast of the blue
and<00:03:55.050> the<00:03:55.140> white<00:03:55.700> and<00:03:56.700> then<00:03:56.790> as<00:03:56.910> we<00:03:57.030> go<00:03:57.150> down<00:03:57.300> to

and the white and then as we go down to

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.870 
and the white and then as we go down to
the<00:03:57.660> flippers<00:03:58.050> it's<00:03:58.770> a<00:03:58.830> nice<00:03:59.010> gradiation<00:03:59.520> from

it's<00:04:08.220> always<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.430> balance<00:04:08.820> with<00:04:09.060> sea<00:04:09.300> creatures

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:09.830 
it's always a balance with sea creatures

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:12.980 
it's always a balance with sea creatures
when<00:04:10.830> you<00:04:11.010> see<00:04:11.220> sea<00:04:11.850> creatures<00:04:12.270> sculpted<00:04:12.840> like

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:12.990 
when you see sea creatures sculpted like

when you see sea creatures sculpted like
this<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.470> want<00:04:13.680> to<00:04:13.740> make<00:04:13.800> them<00:04:14.100> smooth

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
this you want to make them smooth

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.520 
this you want to make them smooth
because<00:04:14.820> they<00:04:15.210> have<00:04:15.420> to<00:04:15.570> you<00:04:16.380> know<00:04:16.440> be

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
because they have to you know be

00:04:22.099 --> 00:04:22.109 
sense of detail and you can see here

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:23.390 
sense of detail and you can see here
they've<00:04:22.260> tried<00:04:22.440> to<00:04:22.590> preserve<00:04:22.740> that<00:04:23.130> with<00:04:23.280> all

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
they've tried to preserve that with all

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.010 
they've tried to preserve that with all
of<00:04:23.430> these<00:04:23.640> striations<00:04:24.270> all<00:04:24.480> over<00:04:24.690> the<00:04:24.810> surface

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
of these striations all over the surface

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.510 
of these striations all over the surface
got<00:04:26.010> some<00:04:26.190> little<00:04:26.340> lumps<00:04:26.760> and<00:04:26.910> bumps<00:04:27.000> there

got some little lumps and bumps there

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:30.860 
got some little lumps and bumps there
got<00:04:29.520> some<00:04:29.670> nice<00:04:29.850> creases<00:04:30.420> in<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:30.660> back

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
got some nice creases in the back

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.710 
got some nice creases in the back
flipper<00:04:31.260> there<00:04:32.000> you<00:04:33.000> just<00:04:33.210> get<00:04:33.330> the<00:04:33.419> feeling

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
flipper there you just get the feeling

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.300 
flipper there you just get the feeling
that<00:04:33.840> these<00:04:33.990> flippers<00:04:34.470> are<00:04:34.590> pushed<00:04:34.830> back<00:04:35.070> and

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:35.310 
that these flippers are pushed back and

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.100 
that these flippers are pushed back and
you<00:04:35.400> just<00:04:35.550> get<00:04:35.669> that<00:04:35.820> nice<00:04:36.060> bulge<00:04:36.450> along<00:04:36.960> the

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
you just get that nice bulge along the

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.450 
you just get that nice bulge along the
back

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:37.460 
back

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:45.370 
back
they're<00:04:37.639> very<00:04:38.270> nice<00:04:41.530> beautiful<00:04:42.530> and<00:04:44.259> then<00:04:45.259> you

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
they're very nice beautiful and then you

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.490 
they're very nice beautiful and then you
can<00:04:45.560> see<00:04:45.710> the<00:04:45.860> short<00:04:46.160> stubby<00:04:46.669> tail<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:48.380> the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
can see the short stubby tail and the

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:54.010 
can see the short stubby tail and the
plasia<00:04:48.740> sore<00:04:49.130> would<00:04:49.310> have<00:04:49.430> had<00:04:51.370> very<00:04:52.370> nice<00:04:53.020> so

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
plasia sore would have had very nice so

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.749 
plasia sore would have had very nice so
overall<00:04:54.440> I<00:04:54.590> think<00:04:54.740> this<00:04:54.949> is<00:04:55.130> a<00:04:55.160> cracking

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:55.759 
overall I think this is a cracking

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:57.879 
overall I think this is a cracking
sculpt<00:04:56.300> and<00:04:56.479> actually<00:04:57.050> I<00:04:57.080> think<00:04:57.110> that<00:04:57.500> the

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
sculpt and actually I think that the

00:04:57.889 --> 00:04:59.469 
sculpt and actually I think that the
head<00:04:58.099> sculpt<00:04:58.520> is<00:04:58.639> probably<00:04:58.910> my<00:04:59.060> favorite

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
head sculpt is probably my favorite

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.150 
head sculpt is probably my favorite
aspect<00:04:59.930> of<00:05:00.080> this<00:05:00.199> creature<00:05:00.530> because<00:05:00.860> it<00:05:00.979> just

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
aspect of this creature because it just

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.219 
aspect of this creature because it just
looks<00:05:01.370> so<00:05:01.610> sinister<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:02.419> as<00:05:02.810> I<00:05:02.840> said<00:05:02.990> this

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
looks so sinister and as I said this

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.320 
looks so sinister and as I said this
would<00:05:03.440> have<00:05:03.530> been<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:03.740> carnivorous<00:05:04.330> version

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:05.330 
would have been the carnivorous version

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.420 
would have been the carnivorous version
of<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.569> plays<00:05:05.780> you<00:05:05.990> saw<00:05:06.229> so<00:05:06.560> it<00:05:06.979> makes<00:05:07.190> sense

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
of the plays you saw so it makes sense

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.730 
of the plays you saw so it makes sense
that<00:05:07.580> he<00:05:07.789> looks<00:05:07.970> a<00:05:08.120> little<00:05:08.210> bit<00:05:08.479> sinister<00:05:08.810> so

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:09.740 
that he looks a little bit sinister so

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.620 
that he looks a little bit sinister so
as<00:05:09.949> I<00:05:10.070> explained<00:05:10.550> this<00:05:10.669> is<00:05:10.820> quite<00:05:11.030> a<00:05:11.060> sizeable

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
as I explained this is quite a sizeable

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.300 
as I explained this is quite a sizeable
beast<00:05:11.900> and<00:05:12.139> I've<00:05:12.199> got<00:05:12.380> the<00:05:12.470> tape<00:05:12.680> measure<00:05:12.889> here

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 
beast and I've got the tape measure here

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.240 
beast and I've got the tape measure here
to<00:05:13.610> tell<00:05:14.539> you<00:05:14.630> exactly<00:05:15.110> how<00:05:15.410> big<00:05:15.650> he<00:05:15.949> is<00:05:15.979> so

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
to tell you exactly how big he is so

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.890 
to tell you exactly how big he is so
we're<00:05:16.400> looking<00:05:16.669> at<00:05:16.759> about<00:05:16.820> nine<00:05:17.270> inches<00:05:17.479> long

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
we're looking at about nine inches long

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:20.920 
we're looking at about nine inches long
which<00:05:18.349> is<00:05:18.410> about<00:05:18.620> 23<00:05:19.099> centimeters<00:05:19.789> and<00:05:20.030> a<00:05:20.780> lot

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
which is about 23 centimeters and a lot

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.610 
which is about 23 centimeters and a lot
of<00:05:20.960> you<00:05:21.080> been<00:05:21.229> asking<00:05:21.349> with<00:05:21.710> Heights<00:05:22.720> so<00:05:23.720> it's

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
about four inches tall just under so

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.370

between nine and ten centimeters it's

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.649 
between nine and ten centimeters it's
time<00:05:30.620> for<00:05:30.889> a<00:05:30.919> size<00:05:31.190> comparison<00:05:31.460> we've<00:05:32.270> got<00:05:32.509> the
