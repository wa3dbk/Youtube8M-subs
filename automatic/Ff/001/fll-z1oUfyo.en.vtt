the American Revolution has to do with

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
the American Revolution has to do with
the<00:00:49.020> fact<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> in<00:00:49.410> Revolution<00:00:49.860> is

basically a revolution of the enslaved
right<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.020> mean<00:00:52.140> others<00:00:52.379> participate

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
right I mean others participate

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.860 
right I mean others participate
obviously<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.789> at<00:00:53.910> the<00:00:54.000> core<00:00:54.239> it's<00:00:54.600> that

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
obviously but at the core it's that

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.630 
obviously but at the core it's that
uprising<00:00:55.559> of<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.710> slaves<00:00:56.039> and<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.340> kind<00:00:56.550> of

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
uprising of the slaves and the kind of

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.939 
uprising of the slaves and the kind of
fight<00:00:57.000> for<00:00:57.030> freedom<00:00:57.600> that<00:00:58.199> really<00:00:58.500> defines

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
fight for freedom that really defines

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.340 
fight for freedom that really defines
what<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.520> Haitian<00:00:59.760> Revolution<00:00:59.789> is<00:01:00.239> about<00:01:00.480> but

what the Haitian Revolution is about but

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.930 
what the Haitian Revolution is about but

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
Revolution but it happens in a very

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.020 
Revolution but it happens in a very
different<00:01:05.129> way<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.280> partly<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
different way and partly the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
situation it was different but what's

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.359

example of basically a planter class
that<00:01:31.530> kind<00:01:31.829> of<00:01:31.920> was<00:01:32.040> able<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.340> free<00:01:32.549> itself

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
that kind of was able to free itself

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.569 
that kind of was able to free itself
from<00:01:32.970> from<00:01:33.509> a<00:01:33.600> metropolitan<00:01:34.259> control<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:35.400> so

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
from from a metropolitan control and so

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.590 
from from a metropolitan control and so
there's<00:01:35.759> a<00:01:35.850> whole<00:01:36.000> there's<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.240> bunch<00:01:36.450> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
there's a whole there's a bunch of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.590 
there's a whole there's a bunch of

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
which people are sort of looking to the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.350 
which people are sort of looking to the
to<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> US<00:01:44.009> as<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.490> as<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> kind<00:01:44.939> of<00:01:45.000> model<00:01:45.240> for

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
how you kind of escape some of the bonds

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.350 
how you kind of escape some of the bonds
of<00:01:47.960> basically<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.110> rules<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.649> Imperial<00:01:50.579> Iike

the Imperial economy that they feel

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.920 
the Imperial economy that they feel
disadvantages<00:01:53.729> them<00:01:53.909> if<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.509> look<00:01:54.720> at<00:01:54.840> the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
disadvantages them if you look at the

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:56.600 
disadvantages them if you look at the
Atlantic<00:01:55.320> during<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.649> period<00:01:55.890> North

Atlantic during this period North
America<00:01:57.030> is<00:01:57.119> actually<00:01:57.240> kind<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:57.960> edge

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
America is actually kind of on the edge

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.749 
America is actually kind of on the edge
of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.920> system<00:01:59.250> right<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.490> actually

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
of the of the system right is actually

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.880 
of the of the system right is actually
not<00:01:59.880> creating<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.450> same<00:02:00.659> density<00:02:01.380> of<00:02:01.469> profits

not creating the same density of profits

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.560 
not creating the same density of profits
and<00:02:02.100> it's<00:02:02.189> not<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.670> not<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:03.090> right<00:02:03.270> it's<00:02:03.299> not

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
and it's not it's not a right it's not

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.030 
and it's not it's not a right it's not
receiving<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.110> same<00:02:04.259> number<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.560> slaves

receiving the same number of slaves

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.069 
receiving the same number of slaves
either<00:02:05.360> because<00:02:06.360> of<00:02:06.390> crop<00:02:06.689> difference

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
either because of crop difference

either because of crop difference
because<00:02:07.409> of<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:08.160> different<00:02:08.429> forms<00:02:08.610> of

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
because of the different forms of

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.979 
because of the different forms of
settlement<00:02:09.060> there's<00:02:09.209> all<00:02:09.479> kinds<00:02:09.750> of<00:02:09.780> reasons

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
settlement there's all kinds of reasons

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:10.880 
settlement there's all kinds of reasons
but<00:02:10.679> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
but the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.890 
but the
fact<00:02:11.069> is<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:11.550> within<00:02:11.850> both<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.510> British<00:02:12.630> and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
fact is that within both the British and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.020 
fact is that within both the British and
the<00:02:12.960> French<00:02:12.990> Empire<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:14.010> Caribbean<00:02:14.550> colonies

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
the French Empire the Caribbean colonies

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.210 
the French Empire the Caribbean colonies
are<00:02:15.690> kind<00:02:15.990> of<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.170> economic<00:02:16.680> powerhouses

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
are kind of the economic powerhouses

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.890 
are kind of the economic powerhouses
right<00:02:17.580> and<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.030> result<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.450> that<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.750> that

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
right and the result of that is that

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.290 
right and the result of that is that
this<00:02:19.050> slave<00:02:19.319> importation<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:20.250> hugely<00:02:20.819> focused

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
this slave importation is hugely focused

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.570 
this slave importation is hugely focused
on<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.750> the<00:02:21.930> Caribbean<00:02:22.380> many<00:02:23.250> more<00:02:23.459> numbers

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
on on the Caribbean many more numbers

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.850 
on on the Caribbean many more numbers
going<00:02:24.090> there<00:02:24.240> it's<00:02:24.990> also<00:02:25.200> true<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.620> the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
going there it's also true that the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.110 
going there it's also true that the
death<00:02:26.040> rates<00:02:26.310> are<00:02:26.459> much<00:02:26.610> higher<00:02:26.670> in<00:02:27.030> the

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
death rates are much higher in the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.820 
death rates are much higher in the
Caribbean<00:02:27.540> so<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.200> have<00:02:28.470> a<00:02:28.500> massive

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
Caribbean so you have a massive

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.530 
Caribbean so you have a massive
importation<00:02:29.370> of<00:02:29.580> slaves<00:02:29.730> and<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.120> send<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.360> Meg

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
importation of slaves and to send a Meg

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.510 
importation of slaves and to send a Meg
but<00:02:30.990> very<00:02:31.290> very<00:02:31.440> high<00:02:31.650> death<00:02:31.830> rates<00:02:32.100> right<00:02:32.310> so

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
but very very high death rates right so

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.430 
but very very high death rates right so
that<00:02:32.700> over<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.660> course<00:02:33.780> say<00:02:34.080> over<00:02:34.320> the<00:02:34.410> course

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
that over the course say over the course

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.710 
that over the course say over the course
of<00:02:34.650> the<00:02:34.709> 18th<00:02:34.980> century<00:02:35.150> we're<00:02:36.150> talking<00:02:36.480> about

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
of the 18th century we're talking about

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.060 
of the 18th century we're talking about
eight<00:02:37.140> hundred<00:02:37.200> eight<00:02:37.500> hundred<00:02:37.770> thousand

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
eight hundred eight hundred thousand

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.820 
eight hundred eight hundred thousand
perhaps<00:02:38.310> more<00:02:38.610> brought<00:02:39.270> in<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:40.410> at<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.680> end

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
perhaps more brought in and at the end

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.870 
perhaps more brought in and at the end
of<00:02:41.010> that<00:02:41.100> time<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.489> have<00:02:41.580> five<00:02:41.760> hundred

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
of that time you have five hundred

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.970 
of that time you have five hundred
thousand<00:02:42.330> slave<00:02:42.959> population<00:02:43.530> or<00:02:43.680> less

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
thousand slave population or less

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
thousand slave population or less
actually

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
actually

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.510 
actually
so<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.959> number<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.380> deaths<00:02:46.650> are<00:02:46.890> extremely

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
so so the number of deaths are extremely

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.210 
so so the number of deaths are extremely
high<00:02:47.670> and<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.750> basically<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:50.040> also

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
high and and basically that that also

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.830 
high and and basically that that also
creates<00:02:50.640> a<00:02:50.730> demographic<00:02:51.060> reality<00:02:51.660> that's

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
creates a demographic reality that's

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.630 
creates a demographic reality that's
really<00:02:52.170> important<00:02:53.040> during<00:02:53.220> the<00:02:53.400> Haitian

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
really important during the Haitian

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.070 
really important during the Haitian
Revolution<00:02:54.060> which<00:02:54.180> is<00:02:54.300> that<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.600> majority<00:02:54.870> of

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
Revolution which is that the majority of

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.390 
Revolution which is that the majority of
people<00:02:55.230> in<00:02:56.010> Haiti<00:02:56.390> in<00:02:57.390> 1804<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.350> in<00:02:58.709> sentiment

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
people in Haiti in 1804 and in sentiment

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.820 
people in Haiti in 1804 and in sentiment
in<00:02:59.519> 1791<00:03:00.090> are<00:03:00.390> African<00:03:01.080> born<00:03:01.230> right<00:03:01.560> these<00:03:01.709> are

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
in 1791 are African born right these are

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.280 
in 1791 are African born right these are

40,000 you know arrivals a year so we

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.530 
40,000 you know arrivals a year so we
talking<00:03:38.340> about<00:03:38.459> massive<00:03:38.850> numbers<00:03:39.180> and<00:03:39.360> that

talking about massive numbers and that

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.660 
talking about massive numbers and that
all<00:03:39.780> shapes<00:03:40.170> the<00:03:40.380> context<00:03:40.829> very<00:03:41.310> much<00:03:41.459> of<00:03:41.610> the

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:43.950 
revolution so the first two declarations

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:45.410 
revolution so the first two declarations
of<00:03:44.310> independence<00:03:44.459> in<00:03:44.790> the<00:03:44.880> world<00:03:45.030> are<00:03:45.269> the

of independence in the world are the

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.819

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
American and the Haitian right those are

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:48.500 
American and the Haitian right those are
the<00:03:46.980> first<00:03:47.190> two<00:03:47.340> texts<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.820> that<00:03:47.970> type<00:03:48.150> and<00:03:48.329> yet

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
the first two texts of that type and yet

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.819 
the first two texts of that type and yet
they<00:03:48.630> couldn't<00:03:48.870> be<00:03:49.079> more<00:03:49.320> different<00:03:49.620> in<00:03:49.739> a

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
they couldn't be more different in a

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.699 
they couldn't be more different in a
sense<00:03:50.010> they're<00:03:50.190> very<00:03:50.459> different<00:03:50.670> in<00:03:50.910> tone<00:03:51.709> one

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
sense they're very different in tone one

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.440 
sense they're very different in tone one
crucial<00:03:53.070> difference<00:03:53.549> is<00:03:53.700> that<00:03:53.850> one<00:03:54.180> of<00:03:54.299> those

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
crucial difference is that one of those

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.030 
crucial difference is that one of those
you<00:03:54.840> know<00:03:54.870> one<00:03:55.079> of<00:03:55.110> them<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.500> American<00:03:55.920> is

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
you know one of them the American is

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.920 
you know one of them the American is

written at the beginning of a war in a

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.270 
written at the beginning of a war in a
sense<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.440> other<00:03:58.709> is<00:03:58.890> written<00:03:59.100> at<00:03:59.190> the

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
sense and the other is written at the

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.009 
sense and the other is written at the
end<00:03:59.310> of<00:03:59.549> war<00:03:59.730> and<00:03:59.970> so<00:04:00.540> the<00:04:00.690> Haitian

devastating consequences on the capacity

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.500

in<00:06:38.750> the<00:06:38.900> broader<00:06:39.140> sense<00:06:39.410> though<00:06:39.650> what's

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:39.860 
in the broader sense though what's

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.740 
in the broader sense though what's
interesting<00:06:40.070> is<00:06:40.370> how<00:06:40.520> fundamental<00:06:41.180> Haiti<00:06:41.480> was

interesting is how fundamental Haiti was

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.260 
interesting is how fundamental Haiti was
towards<00:06:42.200> the<00:06:42.350> kind<00:06:42.530> of<00:06:42.560> progress<00:06:42.830> of<00:06:43.250> of<00:06:43.910> ante

slavery in the in the long term now
there's<00:06:46.700> debates<00:06:47.000> about<00:06:47.150> immediately<00:06:47.990> what

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:48.290 
there's debates about immediately what

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:50.830 
there's debates about immediately what
what<00:06:48.470> effect<00:06:48.740> it<00:06:48.860> had<00:06:49.040> on<00:06:49.300> British<00:06:50.300> abolition

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840

what effect it had on British abolition
and<00:06:50.960> and<00:06:51.170> French<00:06:51.350> abolition<00:06:51.800> and<00:06:51.920> so<00:06:52.010> forth

Revolution to kind of fundamentally

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.730 
Revolution to kind of fundamentally
changed<00:06:55.760> the<00:06:55.970> conversation<00:06:56.720> in<00:06:56.870> a<00:06:57.380> way<00:06:57.410> that's

00:06:57.730 --> 00:06:57.740 
changed the conversation in a way that's

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.040 
changed the conversation in a way that's
kind<00:06:58.010> of<00:06:58.040> irreversible<00:06:58.700> I<00:06:59.330> mean<00:06:59.660> after<00:06:59.810> the

00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.050 
kind of irreversible I mean after the

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:01.300 
kind of irreversible I mean after the
Haitian<00:07:00.260> Revolution<00:07:00.710> you<00:07:00.740> have<00:07:00.980> kind<00:07:01.160> of

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:03.410 
established as a very strong argument

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:05.470 
established as a very strong argument
that<00:07:03.800> there's<00:07:04.340> simply<00:07:04.550> no<00:07:04.850> way<00:07:04.880> to<00:07:05.090> claim

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:05.480 
that there's simply no way to claim

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.210 
that there's simply no way to claim
universal<00:07:06.050> rights<00:07:06.260> while<00:07:06.500> continuing<00:07:07.190> to

Maine slave maintain slavery like the
Haitian<00:07:09.020> revolutionary<00:07:09.500> is<00:07:09.650> that<00:07:09.740> kind<00:07:09.919> of<00:07:09.980> I

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:10.190 
Haitian revolutionary is that kind of I

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:12.070 
Haitian revolutionary is that kind of I
think<00:07:10.610> pushed<00:07:10.850> forward<00:07:11.330> the<00:07:11.360> kind<00:07:11.600> of<00:07:11.750> idea<00:07:12.020> of

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:12.080 
think pushed forward the kind of idea of

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:14.770 
think pushed forward the kind of idea of
universalism<00:07:12.590> in<00:07:12.860> a<00:07:12.919> fundamental<00:07:13.790> way<00:07:13.820> and

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:14.780 
universalism in a fundamental way and

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.180 
universalism in a fundamental way and
afterwards<00:07:15.290> everybody<00:07:15.530> has<00:07:15.830> to<00:07:15.980> kind<00:07:16.160> of

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:16.190 
afterwards everybody has to kind of

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.010 
afterwards everybody has to kind of
reconfigure<00:07:16.700> their<00:07:16.850> arguments<00:07:17.300> and<00:07:17.419> in<00:07:17.840> some

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
reconfigure their arguments and in some

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.170 
reconfigure their arguments and in some
ways<00:07:18.169> in<00:07:18.260> relationship<00:07:18.800> to<00:07:18.830> that<00:07:19.030> and<00:07:20.030> they're

00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.180 
ways in relationship to that and they're

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.460 
ways in relationship to that and they're
gonna<00:07:20.240> often<00:07:20.630> represent<00:07:21.140> Haiti

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:21.470 
gonna often represent Haiti

in either positive or negative ways as

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.060 
in either positive or negative ways as
part<00:07:23.810> of<00:07:23.900> their<00:07:24.050> own<00:07:24.200> arguments<00:07:24.710> about<00:07:24.830> how

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.070 
part of their own arguments about how

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:27.100 
part of their own arguments about how
slavery<00:07:25.490> should<00:07:26.330> be<00:07:26.480> dealt<00:07:26.690> with<00:07:26.750> in<00:07:27.050> the

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:27.110 
slavery should be dealt with in the

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:28.480 
slavery should be dealt with in the
United<00:07:27.260> States<00:07:27.590> that's<00:07:27.770> very<00:07:27.980> much<00:07:28.130> the<00:07:28.190> case

00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:28.490 
United States that's very much the case

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:30.610 
United States that's very much the case
and<00:07:29.120> in<00:07:29.270> fact<00:07:29.450> Haiti's<00:07:30.110> referred<00:07:30.470> to

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:30.620 
and in fact Haiti's referred to

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.260 
and in fact Haiti's referred to
constantly<00:07:31.130> in<00:07:31.310> the<00:07:31.430> debates<00:07:31.730> about<00:07:32.030> slavery

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:32.270 
constantly in the debates about slavery

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.580 
constantly in the debates about slavery
in<00:07:32.360> the<00:07:32.450> United<00:07:32.660> States<00:07:32.840> in<00:07:33.110> the<00:07:33.200> 19th<00:07:33.500> century

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:33.590 
in the United States in the 19th century

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:36.280 
in the United States in the 19th century
so<00:07:34.010> there's<00:07:35.000> a<00:07:35.090> kind<00:07:35.270> of<00:07:35.330> way<00:07:35.510> in<00:07:35.570> which<00:07:35.780> the
