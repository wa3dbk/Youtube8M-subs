I<00:01:23.759> guess<00:01:23.970> he<00:01:24.090> has<00:01:24.209> magic<00:01:25.080> fucking<00:01:25.289> powers<00:01:25.830> that

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I guess he has magic fucking powers that

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.090 
I guess he has magic fucking powers that
the<00:01:26.369> ball<00:01:26.550> just<00:01:26.869> hits<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:28.200> guess<00:01:28.649> it<00:01:28.800> hits<00:01:28.950> the

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
the ball just hits I guess it hits the

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.770 
the ball just hits I guess it hits the
ref<00:01:29.280> which<00:01:29.810> I'm<00:01:30.810> actually<00:01:31.050> surprised<00:01:32.450> is<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.660> I

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
ref which I'm actually surprised is it I

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.300 
ref which I'm actually surprised is it I
don't<00:01:34.020> think<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.470> actually<00:01:34.619> interacts<00:01:35.190> with

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
don't think it actually interacts with

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.080 
don't think it actually interacts with
the<00:01:35.429> ref<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.000> couldn't<00:01:36.450> tell<00:01:36.569> right<00:01:36.780> there

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.150 

no<00:01:43.090> I<00:01:43.120> did<00:01:43.390> it<00:01:43.570> was<00:01:44.140> just<00:01:44.170> a<00:01:44.500> weird<00:01:44.650> angle<00:01:44.860> I

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:45.160 
no I did it was just a weird angle I

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.190 
no I did it was just a weird angle I
didn't<00:01:45.340> really<00:01:45.430> interact<00:01:45.790> with<00:01:46.030> the<00:01:46.120> ref<00:01:46.330> but

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
didn't really interact with the ref but

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.550 
didn't really interact with the ref but
really<00:01:47.500> like<00:01:47.740> the<00:01:48.640> ball<00:01:48.850> bounces<00:01:49.360> rolls<00:01:49.720> it's

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
really like the ball bounces rolls it's

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.340 
really like the ball bounces rolls it's
going<00:01:50.860> out<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:50.980> bounds<00:01:51.660> he<00:01:52.660> takes<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:53.110> weird

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
going out of bounds he takes a weird

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.620 
going out of bounds he takes a weird
angle<00:01:53.740> I<00:01:54.220> mean<00:01:54.580> he<00:01:54.730> has<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:55.060> take<00:01:55.210> that<00:01:55.390> weird

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
angle I mean he has to take that weird

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.950 
angle I mean he has to take that weird
angle<00:01:56.020> because<00:01:56.800> because<00:01:57.670> these<00:01:57.850> people<00:01:58.090> know

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
angle because because these people know

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.810 
angle because because these people know
he<00:01:59.590> doesn't<00:01:59.770> have<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.040> take<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.310> weird<00:02:00.490> angle

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:00.820 
he doesn't have to take the weird angle

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.700 
he doesn't have to take the weird angle
apparently<00:02:01.630> cuz<00:02:01.900> he<00:02:02.110> could<00:02:02.260> walk<00:02:02.410> through

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
apparently cuz he could walk through

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.030

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
he why did he take the weird angle

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.730 
he why did he take the weird angle
whenever<00:02:08.020> he<00:02:08.170> could<00:02:08.290> just<00:02:08.530> walk<00:02:08.710> through

first the trajectory is totally off

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.020 
first the trajectory is totally off
because<00:05:25.960> it<00:05:25.990> goes<00:05:26.350> through<00:05:26.860> my<00:05:27.040> arm<00:05:27.280> instead

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:28.030

of bouncing out or below like above

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.870 
of bouncing out or below like above
going<00:05:31.420> like<00:05:31.960> he<00:05:32.440> hits<00:05:32.650> it<00:05:32.770> with<00:05:32.890> his<00:05:33.010> helmet<00:05:33.250> it

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
going like he hits it with his helmet it

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.140

out<00:05:37.510> and<00:05:37.930> go<00:05:38.410> forward<00:05:38.830> it<00:05:39.010> could<00:05:39.130> go<00:05:39.250> any

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
out and go forward it could go any

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.370
