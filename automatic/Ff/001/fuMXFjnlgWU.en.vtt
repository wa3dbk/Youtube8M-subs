kind<00:02:21.269> of<00:02:21.360> like<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> tank<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.620> highly<00:02:22.830> technical

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
kind of like a tank but highly technical

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.270 
kind of like a tank but highly technical
that's<00:02:24.090> simply<00:02:24.780> what<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.260> Batmobile<00:02:25.830> should

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.250 
that's simply what the Batmobile should
be<00:02:26.610> so<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.269> kind<00:02:27.510> of<00:02:27.599> the<00:02:27.720> mix<00:02:27.989> of<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
be so it's kind of the mix of the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.530 
be so it's kind of the mix of the
tumbler<00:02:28.709> from<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.069> Dark<00:02:29.310> Knight<00:02:29.489> films<00:02:29.909> but

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
we've seen in even previous Arkham games

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.100 
we've seen in even previous Arkham games
such<00:02:35.549> as<00:02:35.579> arkham<00:02:36.000> asylum's<00:02:36.420> opening<00:02:36.870> cutscene
