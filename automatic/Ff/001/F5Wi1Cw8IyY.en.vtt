00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
on a recent ski trip I had a symptom

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.499 
on a recent ski trip I had a symptom
where<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.219> washer<00:00:11.219> pump<00:00:11.490> for<00:00:12.210> the<00:00:12.300> wiper

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
where the washer pump for the wiper

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:14.720 
where the washer pump for the wiper
blades<00:00:12.900> though<00:00:13.650> with<00:00:13.920> that<00:00:13.950> wiper<00:00:14.429> washer

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
blades though with that wiper washer

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.900 
blades though with that wiper washer
fluid<00:00:15.020> the<00:00:16.020> pump<00:00:16.230> wasn't<00:00:16.560> pumping<00:00:16.710> fluid<00:00:17.699> on

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
fluid the pump wasn't pumping fluid on

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.090 
fluid the pump wasn't pumping fluid on
the<00:00:18.029> front<00:00:18.359> or<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:18.570> back<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.990> my<00:00:19.109> 1999<00:00:19.859> Toyota

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
the front or the back of my 1999 Toyota

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.970 
the front or the back of my 1999 Toyota
Sienna<00:00:20.640> and<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.720> wash<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.230> wipers<00:00:22.710> worked

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
Sienna and the wash the wipers worked

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.320 
Sienna and the wash the wipers worked
but<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.000> pumps<00:00:24.300> didn't<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.910> it<00:00:26.910> turns<00:00:27.180> out

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
but the pumps didn't and it turns out

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.790 
but the pumps didn't and it turns out
doing<00:00:27.630> some<00:00:27.750> research<00:00:27.900> apparently<00:00:28.529> that's<00:00:28.619> on

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
doing some research apparently that's on

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.849 
doing some research apparently that's on
the<00:00:28.890> same<00:00:29.039> circuit<00:00:29.429> breaker<00:00:29.640> so<00:00:30.529> or<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:31.710> same

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
the same circuit breaker so or the same

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.479 
the same circuit breaker so or the same
fuse<00:00:32.189> so<00:00:32.550> with<00:00:33.210> what<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.050> suspected<00:00:34.710> was<00:00:35.309> that

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
fuse so with what I suspected was that

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.130 
fuse so with what I suspected was that
the<00:00:35.610> pumps<00:00:35.910> something<00:00:36.360> was<00:00:36.780> wrong<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.079> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
the pumps something was wrong with the

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.350 
the pumps something was wrong with the
pumps<00:00:37.530> and<00:00:37.920> with<00:00:38.550> both<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.030> front<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.329> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
pumps and with both the front in the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.260 
pumps and with both the front in the
back<00:00:39.540> out<00:00:39.840> at<00:00:40.559> the<00:00:40.739> same<00:00:40.950> time<00:00:41.090> that<00:00:42.090> was<00:00:42.210> a

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
back out at the same time that was a

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.299 
back out at the same time that was a
little<00:00:42.570> suspect<00:00:43.410> to<00:00:43.559> actually<00:00:43.829> having<00:00:44.100> frozen

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
little suspect to actually having frozen

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.000 
little suspect to actually having frozen
pump<00:00:44.700> so<00:00:44.820> here's<00:00:45.000> I<00:00:45.149> how<00:00:45.780> I<00:00:45.809> fixed<00:00:46.350> it<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.770> it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
pump so here's I how I fixed it and it

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.410 
pump so here's I how I fixed it and it
was<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> really<00:00:47.399> a<00:00:47.430> pretty<00:00:47.969> simple<00:00:48.270> solution

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
was a really a pretty simple solution

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.150 
was a really a pretty simple solution
before<00:00:49.200> you<00:00:49.410> go<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.590> a<00:00:49.649> dealer<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.420> have<00:00:51.420> him

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
before you go to a dealer and have him

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.410 
before you go to a dealer and have him
go<00:00:53.160> through<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:53.430> Hawkins<00:00:53.789> expenses<00:00:54.210> try<00:00:54.360> to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
go through all Hawkins expenses try to

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.540 
go through all Hawkins expenses try to
try<00:00:54.750> to<00:00:54.780> troubleshoot<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.680> issue

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
try to troubleshoot with this issue

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.450 
try to troubleshoot with this issue
first<00:00:57.120> so<00:00:57.930> here's<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.649> washer<00:00:59.010> fluid<00:00:59.190> it

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
first so here's the the washer fluid it

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.430 
first so here's the the washer fluid it
was<00:00:59.579> full<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.210> was<00:01:00.600> showing<00:01:00.899> liquid<00:01:01.230> at<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
was full and was showing liquid at the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.100 
was full and was showing liquid at the
top<00:01:01.910> but<00:01:02.910> in<00:01:03.030> fact<00:01:03.300> with<00:01:03.510> the<00:01:03.600> cold<00:01:03.809> weather<00:01:03.930> we

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
top but in fact with the cold weather we

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.850 
top but in fact with the cold weather we
had<00:01:04.290> here<00:01:04.470> in<00:01:04.530> North<00:01:04.710> Carolina<00:01:05.540> and<00:01:06.860> probably

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
had here in North Carolina and probably

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.740 
had here in North Carolina and probably
some<00:01:08.130> suspects<00:01:08.700> washer<00:01:09.030> fluid<00:01:09.439> it<00:01:10.439> ended<00:01:10.740> up

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
some suspects washer fluid it ended up

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.590 
some suspects washer fluid it ended up
freezing<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> pumps<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:14.100> right<00:01:14.520> here<00:01:14.939> you've

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
freezing the pumps so right here you've

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.320 
freezing the pumps so right here you've
got<00:01:15.780> two<00:01:15.960> fasteners<00:01:16.500> on<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.740> on<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
got two fasteners on the on the the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.020 
got two fasteners on the on the the
wheel<00:01:19.049> well<00:01:19.470> cover<00:01:19.950> okay<00:01:20.520> here's<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.850> here's

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
wheel well cover okay here's the here's

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.740 
wheel well cover okay here's the here's
the<00:01:21.119> fender<00:01:21.740> two<00:01:22.740> fasteners<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.509> you<00:01:24.509> can

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
the fender two fasteners that you can

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.660 
the fender two fasteners that you can
undo<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.040> get<00:01:26.729> at<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.979> pump<00:01:28.979> housing<00:01:29.310> in

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
undo and get at the pump housing in

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.039 
undo and get at the pump housing in
there<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:29.939> I'll<00:01:30.000> take<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> picture<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.750> see<00:01:31.020> a

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
there and I'll take a picture that see a

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.380 
there and I'll take a picture that see a
little<00:01:31.259> better<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:32.490> undo<00:01:32.820> these<00:01:32.939> two<00:01:33.000> has

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
little better so undo these two has

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.630 
little better so undo these two has
these<00:01:33.810> two<00:01:34.049> screws<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.770> get<00:01:35.159> at<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.310> pump<00:01:35.520> if

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
these two screws to get at the pump if

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.800 
these two screws to get at the pump if
you<00:01:35.700> need<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.939> replace<00:01:36.240> the<00:01:36.420> pumps<00:01:36.720> well

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
you need to replace the pumps well

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.450 
you need to replace the pumps well
that's<00:01:36.960> a<00:01:37.049> little<00:01:37.140> more<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.439> an<00:01:37.530> in-depth<00:01:38.159> job

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
that's a little more of an in-depth job

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.550 
that's a little more of an in-depth job
but<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.180> got<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.479> it'll<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:39.930> you<00:01:40.079> started

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
but it got just it'll get you started

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.810 
but it got just it'll get you started
and<00:01:40.710> then<00:01:40.799> you'll<00:01:41.340> least<00:01:41.520> be<00:01:41.640> able<00:01:41.729> to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
and then you'll least be able to

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.359 
and then you'll least be able to
troubleshoot<00:01:42.229> so<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.259> put<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.560> hair<00:01:43.799> dryer<00:01:44.130> in

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
troubleshoot so I put a hair dryer in

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.569 
troubleshoot so I put a hair dryer in
there<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.270> warmed<00:01:46.079> up<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.380> pumps<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.920> then

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
there and warmed up the pumps and then

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.319 
there and warmed up the pumps and then
the<00:01:47.670> fluid<00:01:47.970> flows<00:01:48.470> flowed<00:01:49.470> freely<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.520> I'll

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the fluid flows flowed freely and I'll

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.410 
the fluid flows flowed freely and I'll
put<00:01:51.540> in<00:01:51.630> better<00:01:51.899> washer<00:01:52.860> fluid<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:54.000> next<00:01:54.240> time

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
put in better washer fluid the next time

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.649 
put in better washer fluid the next time
around<00:01:54.570> so<00:01:55.549> I'll<00:01:56.549> show<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.850> it<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.390> just<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
around so I'll show you it in just a

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.980 
around so I'll show you it in just a
second<00:01:58.159> with<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.340> screws<00:01:59.850> off<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.810> that

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
second with the screws off this is that

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
those were in fact frozen so just that

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.240 
those were in fact frozen so just that
one<00:02:32.990> fastener<00:02:33.440> then<00:02:33.590> we'll<00:02:33.709> probably<00:02:33.830> get<00:02:34.100> you

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
one fastener then we'll probably get you

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.920 
one fastener then we'll probably get you
enough<00:02:34.400> room<00:02:34.580> to<00:02:34.790> get<00:02:35.180> a<00:02:35.239> hair<00:02:35.420> dryer<00:02:35.660> in<00:02:35.810> there

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
enough room to get a hair dryer in there

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.720 
enough room to get a hair dryer in there
get<00:02:36.110> some<00:02:36.140> warmth<00:02:36.560> or<00:02:36.860> maybe<00:02:37.130> a<00:02:37.220> heat<00:02:37.370> lamp<00:02:37.400> or

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
get some warmth or maybe a heat lamp or

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.600 
get some warmth or maybe a heat lamp or
something<00:02:37.760> but<00:02:39.100> always<00:02:40.100> be<00:02:40.250> tending<00:02:40.580> that

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:40.610 
something but always be tending that

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.590 
something but always be tending that
heat<00:02:40.910> source<00:02:41.209> so<00:02:41.770> nothing<00:02:42.770> bad<00:02:42.950> happens<00:02:43.600> but

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.600 
heat source so nothing bad happens but

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.509 
heat source so nothing bad happens but
anyway<00:02:44.840> just<00:02:44.870> thought<00:02:45.410> it<00:02:45.800> off<00:02:45.950> and<00:02:46.280> then<00:02:46.370> they

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
anyway just thought it off and then they

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.000 
anyway just thought it off and then they
worked<00:02:46.730> fine<00:02:46.970> if<00:02:47.959> you<00:02:48.080> need<00:02:48.200> to<00:02:48.290> undo<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:48.769> one

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:21.950 
fastener here which is a bolt it's a

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.440 
fastener here which is a bolt it's a
bold<00:03:22.190> actually<00:03:22.579> that's<00:03:22.850> a<00:03:22.940> different<00:03:23.269> screw

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
bold actually that's a different screw

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.420 
bold actually that's a different screw
so<00:03:23.630> make<00:03:23.780> sure<00:03:23.900> you<00:03:23.989> keep<00:03:24.140> track<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.650> and<00:03:25.250> we

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
so make sure you keep track of it and we

so make sure you keep track of it and we
keep<00:03:25.730> track<00:03:25.910> of<00:03:25.970> which<00:03:26.180> screws<00:03:26.480> go<00:03:26.660> and<00:03:26.810> where

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
keep track of which screws go and where

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:28.539 
keep track of which screws go and where
because<00:03:27.200> they<00:03:27.290> do<00:03:27.350> actually<00:03:27.860> there's<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.519> few

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
because they do actually there's a few

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.140 
because they do actually there's a few
differences<00:03:29.829> right<00:03:30.829> here's<00:03:31.280> that<00:03:31.549> last<00:03:31.820> one

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
differences right here's that last one

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.259 
differences right here's that last one
this<00:03:32.540> one<00:03:32.750> has<00:03:32.870> a<00:03:32.930> rubber<00:03:33.230> gasket<00:03:33.470> that<00:03:33.920> the

this one has a rubber gasket that the

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.170 
this one has a rubber gasket that the
the<00:03:35.269> cover<00:03:35.510> stays<00:03:36.290> attached<00:03:36.680> to<00:03:36.709> I<00:03:37.190> don't<00:03:38.090> know

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
the cover stays attached to I don't know

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.699 
the cover stays attached to I don't know
if<00:03:38.269> you<00:03:38.360> need<00:03:38.480> to<00:03:38.540> pull<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.989> if<00:03:39.200> you<00:03:39.260> need<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.530> a

if you need to pull the if you need to a

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.620 
if you need to pull the if you need to a
lot<00:03:40.100> of<00:03:40.130> room<00:03:40.430> you<00:03:40.459> can<00:03:40.790> pull<00:03:41.030> that<00:03:41.060> cover<00:03:41.390> off

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
lot of room you can pull that cover off

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.690 
lot of room you can pull that cover off
but<00:03:41.840> it<00:03:41.900> is<00:03:41.959> kind<00:03:42.739> of<00:03:42.769> a<00:03:42.860> bear<00:03:43.040> getting<00:03:43.250> it<00:03:43.430> back

off that there's a little rubber gasket
and<00:03:45.620> you'll<00:03:45.739> see<00:03:45.890> what<00:03:46.040> I'm<00:03:46.130> talking<00:03:46.459> about<00:03:46.519> if

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
and you'll see what I'm talking about if

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.090 
and you'll see what I'm talking about if
you<00:03:46.820> ever<00:03:46.940> try<00:03:47.180> it<00:03:47.209> anyway<00:03:48.140> so<00:03:48.170> that's<00:03:48.590> that's

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
you ever try it anyway so that's that's

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.860 
you ever try it anyway so that's that's
it<00:03:49.400> it<00:03:49.610> was<00:03:49.730> a<00:03:49.760> pretty<00:03:49.880> easy<00:03:50.120> fix

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
it it was a pretty easy fix

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.050 
it it was a pretty easy fix
