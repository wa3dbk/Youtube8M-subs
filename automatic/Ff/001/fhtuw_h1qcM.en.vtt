00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.850
 and the presence of bacteria and algae are 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.280
 The main danger of a pool 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.169
 when we look at the water in the 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.599
 nature we see that it is the main 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:18.800
 means to facilitate life of all kinds 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:21.020
 of organisms in the pools we 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.960
 we must deactivate that kind of 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.940
 behaviors when we do not get the 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.530
 Our water quality is bad and we 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.210
 we are forced to do a treatment 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:35.030
 Shock with large loads 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:36.980
 chemicals together with a good 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.750
 cleaning background and walls 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.030
 main aspects that we must take care of 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.030
 in a pool are the filtration 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.920
 the chlorination and the ph level is 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.350
 essential that chlorine and ph are 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.809
 always balanced the chlorine is a 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.760
 very powerful disinfectant agent but 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.480
 It is also unstable and affected 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.480
 by various factors 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.740
 one of them is the ph a high or low ph 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:10.780
 blocks to a large extent the action of 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.780
 chlorine and causes problems for the bathroom 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.790
 also when the chlorine degrades 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:24.220
 produces clear mines a derivative that is 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.220
 irritant and produces a bad smell in the water 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.900
 until a few years ago the solution was a 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.730
 good control and a good hand to 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.580
 add the different products without 

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.200
 pass or fall short now and the 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.120
 pools have learned to take care 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.960
 practically alone this is the 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:43.580
 alternative saline coloration 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.440
 we add salt in a lot of concentration 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.630
 lower than sea ​​water but 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.600
 enough to add your advantages to 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.130
 the skin and mucous membranes at the same time 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.570
 this is the one that allows us to 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.970
 operation of our team 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.490
 electrolysis with this process we perform 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.560
 a necessary disinfection producing 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.820
 a chlorine that does not degrade but rather 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.380
 removed by the effect of the sun's rays 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.840
 this team you may incorporate a 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.850
 ph controller that assures us a 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.770
 optimal water acidity both for your 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.900
 disinfection as for our own 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.940
 organism there are other teams that what 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.920
 they are already 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.290
 the installation of the chlorinator is very 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.760
 simple the cell is placed in the tube 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.760
 making a couple of holes 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.680
 each 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.890
 the pool specialists we choose 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.600
 this type of equipment that guarantee us 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:38.970
 a long life of the electrodes 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.310
 responsible in this process the chlorinator 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.860
 saline of zodiac has some electrodes 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.300
 self-cleaning long life and account 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.580
 with two years of unconditional guarantee 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.310
 the cristinas with good coloration 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.050
 output are easy to detect 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.330
 enough alerts or especially 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.350
 immerse yourself in them to notice 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.350
 immediately the difference
