think but it was $11 it and you have to

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.600 
think but it was $11 it and you have to
split<00:01:55.840> it<00:01:55.990> like<00:01:56.080> that<00:01:56.320> e<00:01:56.530> and<00:01:57.040> then<00:01:57.670> space<00:01:58.510> LD

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
split it like that e and then space LD

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.220 
split it like that e and then space LD
flip<00:02:00.610> color<00:02:01.830> soft<00:02:02.830> touch<00:02:03.130> here<00:02:03.930> soft<00:02:04.930> touch

suppose<00:03:34.340> buttes<00:03:34.849> and<00:03:37.359> stand<00:03:38.359> a<00:03:39.010> case<00:03:40.010> so<00:03:40.940> as

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
suppose buttes and stand a case so as

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:48.550 
suppose buttes and stand a case so as
you<00:03:41.450> can<00:03:41.569> see<00:03:43.480> it's<00:03:44.480> like<00:03:44.660> show<00:03:45.019> you<00:03:47.560> suppose

you can see it's like show you suppose
what<00:03:48.799> extent<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:50.709> mean<00:03:51.709> you<00:03:51.829> could<00:03:51.950> do<00:03:52.099> it<00:03:52.190> that

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
what extent I mean you could do it that

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.410 
what extent I mean you could do it that
way<00:03:54.489> you<00:03:55.489> could<00:03:55.640> do<00:03:55.790> it<00:03:55.909> this<00:03:56.090> way<00:03:58.239> but<00:03:59.239> this

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
way you could do it this way but this

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.990 
way you could do it this way but this
way<00:03:59.569> there's<00:03:59.870> not<00:04:00.049> a<00:04:00.079> lot<00:04:00.260> of<00:04:00.290> grip<00:04:00.590> early<00:04:02.920> any

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:15.229 

sixy<00:04:08.859> just<00:04:09.859> works<00:04:10.130> fine<00:04:10.400> this<00:04:10.669> way

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:19.550 

overall<00:04:16.239> the<00:04:16.420> case<00:04:16.660> is<00:04:17.520> doing<00:04:18.520> its<00:04:18.670> job

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
overall the case is doing its job

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:26.030 
overall the case is doing its job
covering<00:04:20.560> the<00:04:20.890> screen<00:04:22.590> covering<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:23.680> body

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.380 

everything<00:04:27.040> seems<00:04:27.420> well<00:04:28.440> manufactured<00:04:30.390> as

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
everything seems well manufactured as

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.330 
everything seems well manufactured as
you<00:04:31.540> can<00:04:31.690> see<00:04:31.900> directly<00:04:32.470> right<00:04:33.250> on<00:04:33.550> it<00:04:35.340> nothing

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
you can see directly right on it nothing

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:42.690 
you can see directly right on it nothing
covering<00:04:36.700> nothing<00:04:39.270> the<00:04:40.270> front<00:04:41.520> you<00:04:42.520> can<00:04:42.580> see

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:42.700 
covering nothing the front you can see

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.550 
covering nothing the front you can see
that<00:04:42.970> right<00:04:43.600> there

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.900 

but<00:04:49.560> that's<00:04:49.950> about<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:50.280> I<00:04:52.580> would<00:04:53.580> recommend

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:53.910 
but that's about it I would recommend

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.000 
but that's about it I would recommend
this<00:04:54.390> case<00:04:56.090> over<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.600> stock<00:04:58.170> Samsung<00:04:58.770> case

00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.010 
this case over the stock Samsung case

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:00.980 
this case over the stock Samsung case
that<00:04:59.340> you<00:04:59.370> got<00:04:59.640> to<00:04:59.760> take<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.480> battery<00:05:00.810> cover

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
that you got to take the battery cover

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.660 
that you got to take the battery cover
off<00:05:03.560> because<00:05:04.560> this<00:05:04.710> is<00:05:04.830> real<00:05:05.100> solve<00:05:05.400> real

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:05.670 
off because this is real solve real

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:08.710 
off because this is real solve real
comfortable<00:05:06.090> it<00:05:06.330> doesn't<00:05:06.600> stick<00:05:06.840> to<00:05:06.870> nothing

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720
