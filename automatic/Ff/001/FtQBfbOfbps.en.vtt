a<00:03:40.769> bit<00:03:40.950> more<00:03:40.980> challenging<00:03:41.849> than<00:03:42.090> Mario<00:03:42.450> Kart

00:03:47.949 --> 00:03:47.959 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:58.610

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:48.030 

and<00:04:44.040> then<00:04:45.040> you<00:04:45.250> got<00:04:45.490> the<00:04:45.850> opportunity<00:04:46.000> to<00:04:47.040> take
