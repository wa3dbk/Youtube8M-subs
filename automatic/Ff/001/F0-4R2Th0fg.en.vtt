the<00:04:24.830> yellow<00:04:25.130> chalk<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:25.700> what<00:04:25.850> I<00:04:25.880> do<00:04:26.060> to<00:04:26.240> apply

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
the yellow chalk and what I do to apply

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.900 
the yellow chalk and what I do to apply
chalk<00:04:27.050> into<00:04:27.290> my<00:04:27.440> hair<00:04:27.650> is<00:04:27.860> to<00:04:28.010> mix<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.520> with<00:04:28.880> a

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:28.910 
chalk into my hair is to mix it with a

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.700 
chalk into my hair is to mix it with a
bit<00:04:29.060> of<00:04:29.090> styling<00:04:29.570> cream<00:04:29.780> in<00:04:30.050> order<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.500> get<00:04:30.620> the

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:30.710 
bit of styling cream in order to get the

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.320 
bit of styling cream in order to get the
most<00:04:30.860> pigmentation<00:04:31.580> out<00:04:31.700> of<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.880> chalk<00:04:32.120> if

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
most pigmentation out of the chalk if

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.690 
most pigmentation out of the chalk if
you<00:04:32.450> apply<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:32.750> onto<00:04:32.990> dry<00:04:33.350> hair<00:04:33.650> it<00:04:34.280> will<00:04:34.490> take

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
you apply it onto dry hair it will take

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.880 
you apply it onto dry hair it will take
ages<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:35.180> build<00:04:35.450> the<00:04:35.540> color<00:04:35.720> up<00:04:35.810> so<00:04:36.170> I<00:04:36.200> mix<00:04:36.680> it

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:36.890 
ages to build the color up so I mix it

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:38.500 
ages to build the color up so I mix it
with<00:04:36.920> a<00:04:37.310> little<00:04:37.580> bit<00:04:37.700> of<00:04:37.760> my<00:04:37.970> Moroccan<00:04:38.420> oil

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:38.510

styling<00:04:38.990> cream<00:04:39.170> first<00:04:39.470> and<00:04:39.800> then<00:04:40.160> apply<00:04:40.370> it

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
styling cream first and then apply it

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:42.130 
styling cream first and then apply it
into<00:04:40.850> the<00:04:40.940> hair<00:04:41.090> with<00:04:41.210> my<00:04:41.330> fingers<00:04:41.360> and<00:04:41.960> blend

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 
it in that was starting with yellow to

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.580 
it in that was starting with yellow to
create<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.270> very<00:04:44.480> tip<00:04:44.810> of<00:04:44.990> the<00:04:45.050> flame<00:04:45.260> a

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
create the very tip of the flame a

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.500 
create the very tip of the flame a
little<00:04:45.980> bit<00:04:46.130> higher<00:04:46.370> than<00:04:46.640> the<00:04:47.090> ends<00:04:47.390> of<00:04:47.480> your

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
hair and then I'm moving on to orange

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.920 
hair and then I'm moving on to orange
and<00:04:49.580> I'm<00:04:49.940> just<00:04:50.150> going<00:04:50.390> to<00:04:50.600> apply<00:04:50.870> this

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
and I'm just going to apply this

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.020 
and I'm just going to apply this
slightly<00:04:51.860> underneath<00:04:52.370> where<00:04:52.640> apply<00:04:52.970> the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
slightly underneath where apply the

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:54.580 
slightly underneath where apply the
yellow<00:04:53.390> so<00:04:53.450> that<00:04:53.570> you<00:04:53.720> get<00:04:53.870> that<00:04:53.990> effect<00:04:54.140> of

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:54.590 
yellow so that you get that effect of

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:57.370 
yellow so that you get that effect of
the<00:04:55.520> flame<00:04:55.880> like<00:04:56.330> in<00:04:56.540> the<00:04:56.720> tips<00:04:56.990> of<00:04:57.170> your<00:04:57.200> hair
