00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:09.600
 how to make a bottle cartridge 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.600
 Water 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:14.010
 clean for what 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.869
 and look at the whole process 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.060
 let's do is cut the bottle 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.330
 the air 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.130
 I'm going to cut in one way 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.730
 and bada 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.730
 if they were 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.989
 why 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.610
 then after we continue we proceed to 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.100
 paint it 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.290
 let's paint it inside in the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.930
 past tutorial we already look at how to paint 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.990
 the bottle and then after I go to 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.579
 have it 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:19.810
 painted let's proceed to bend towards 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:19.810
 outside the shore 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.550
 an art form 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.780
 for many of the time we are going to 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.020
 open up a bit when we feel very 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.509
 forced the bottle of the shores let's go 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.350
 to give a small opening nothing more 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.350
 to give him play 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.830
 to the bottle then it's going very cut 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.790
 I died here sometimes it opens too 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.790
 a little more 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.270
 to be able to have flexible audio 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:59.560
 without fear of opening the bottle 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.609
 to double 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.420
 and then we throw again 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.299
 and the parts that are very bent or 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.049
 that opened then we're going to 

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.049
 do now 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.239
 come and round with the scissors 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.320
 until there is no more we continue to mold 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.870
 and then follow them 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.060
 Y 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.709
 the bottle will turn us 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.709
 until we go shaping 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.770
 now we have it on the folded bank 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.610
 and then what we are going to do is 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:43.020
 make a hole and I have the right 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.530
 hot gun 7 what can I do 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.530
 hole 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.370
 I enter the wire to top 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.600
 to give the center 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.910
 so that it fits him 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.970
 the center of 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:28.450
 of the cartridge I'm going to bend the wire 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:28.450
 down to make it wide 

00:04:28.529 --> 00:04:33.259
 most remarkable 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.259
 center 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.700
 here already process 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.190
 I work the plastic 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.690
 and then the procedure to follow 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.690
 is to wait a while 

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:08.570
 so that we stay like this and then 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.910
 after this we already proceed to the 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.430
 height of this just about us and everything 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:16.540
 already after that we painted it 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.540
 we decorated the center 

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:25.590
 and then this already after that 

00:05:23.039 --> 00:05:28.340
 we have him 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.340
 glued 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:37.430
 we can and we can decorate this 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:39.710
 we can not paint it the color that 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:42.920
 we want something then the 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:44.390
 following the process after putting it 

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:47.000
 the leaves that also come out of the 

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:48.310
 bottle we cut them in the video 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.200
 previous 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:52.690
 and this 

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.850
 and we already have it ready 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:57.430
 also the other option that we have is 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:59.710
 we introduce it, we introduce the 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:01.510
 wire all inside but we have 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:05.260
 this other option that also leaves 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:09.370
 empty paste nothing more in the shell 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:11.710
 in the cover the wire to 7 that here I 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:14.760
 I have the option of putting the part of 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:14.760
 in as center 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:22.750
 a bent wire or a cardboard tube 

00:06:19.629 --> 00:06:24.789
 decorated painted as I want it to be or 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:26.860
 that's quite personal and I already 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:31.379
 we introduce there we leave it a high 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:31.379
 that is remarkable and we have it ready 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:37.270
 How are we recycling? 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:40.950
 here I also have a bottle that I 

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:40.950
 I have this one 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.440
 7 which is where I'm going to put 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:55.500
 cartridges 

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:56.639
 come on let's look at how to decorate 123 

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:59.490
 post later 

00:06:56.639 --> 00:07:01.530
 first god and this then this is it 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.969
 how are we going to work the cartridges and 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.969
 this was the idea of the cartridges 

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:10.770
 if it helps them and well here it was 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:13.520
 work 

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:13.520
 cartridges 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:19.050
