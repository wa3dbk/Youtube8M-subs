00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.759
 there was diego sandoval whoever 

00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:04.990
 We appreciate of course for that good 

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:06.910
 Interview with Juan Diego Ramírez 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.620
 It also leaves us all the anecdotes that 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.330
 may not pick up in so many years in the 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.030
 cycling these 25 years of career 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:15.190
 sports are 25 years the same can be 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.689
 congratulations for what he did so 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.489
 that he achieved by national cycling in 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.079
 so much sport career time now 

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:21.759
 let's go to the tips of cycling 

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:23.800
 that of course they are going to bring us a theme 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:26.189
 very interesting and that 's when you have the 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.079
 bicycle has suspension as it should 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.609
 accommodate square depending on one of 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:32.710
 its sides very simple tips and 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:34.750
 practical so pay attention to 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:38.490
 what are the tips cycling 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.490
 thanks to gvt as 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.890
 good evening everyone and welcome to 

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.629
 the tips of the wheel my name is daniel 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.430
 álvarez director of said hand to 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.469
 Colombia and we will explain them in 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.680
 Jorge Paez's company how to throw a 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.589
 suspension applies to if your bicycle 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.479
 they are only suspended front apply the 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:08.450
 same theory being fired in back 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:10.100
 follow all the same steps this for 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.840
 the suspension is that they are air that we 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.460
 allow the weight to be squared 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.399
 Air pressure forgiveness according to weight 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.310
 very accurate athlete to start them 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.110
 is going to explain what is the sac the sag is 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.270
 what the suspension is compressed with 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.819
 weight of the true sportsman that we're going 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.979
 to measure with these with these bits that 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:32.390
 have the extensions here if we talk 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.340
 of a discrete cross-country view is 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.130
 between 20 of that subject are from 20 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.630
 percent hard bread roughly 25 and in 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.090
 Downhill can be up to 30 per 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.799
 hundred or 25 depending on the track and 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.090
 needs of one that we're going to start 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.570
 with 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.479
 jorge runs stile for fa then the 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.130
 crystal has been assembled and is going to move 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.289
 on the bicycle to seat the 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.229
 suspensions then it stays still in 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.259
 a position like it's going down and 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:02.659
 let's put the marks at the point that 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.610
 it must be here I hold the bicycle 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.130
 why come down please support it 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.349
 so they do not go to me out of position the 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.780
 brands here we're going to measure this 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.569
 suspension has 13 centimeters of 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.370
 travel or 130 millimeters what he wants 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.380
 say that 20 percent is 26 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.319
 millimeters let's measure 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.209
 here are 34 then you need a 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.720
 pound of pressure we are going to look 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.380
 how many pounds 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.630
 this 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.530
 this piston so to speak has 5 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.960
 centimeters 50 millimeters what he wants 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.760
 say that the sag the tour that we 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.550
 must make 1 centimeter which is 20 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.460
 in this case we are just 2 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.819
 millimeters that we have the point that 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.890
 it is then we are going to put it 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.720
 about ten pounds or so to try 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.390
 at this moment the suspension has 100 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.390
 pressure pounds télam up to 110 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.680
 then we go to the front suspension 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:06.130
 we remove the air cap 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.010
 and we are going to do the same 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.680
 here we need to be in 26 millimeters 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.349
 they were 30 then we're going in on this 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.720
 moment we have 50 pounds of pressure 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:20.269
 let's do 65 and we'll do it again 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.610
 the exercise with Jorge Ar as soon as we 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:27.069
 that hike 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.290
 we repeat the exercise jorges please 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:31.540
 you're going to do the same thing you're going to 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.090
 jump to remove the expression you 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.280
 is in the attack position or 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.650
 decline 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.650
 I hold it and I killed please 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:45.280
 and we are going to measure it here 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.850
 there is 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.950
 in 25 millimeters we're fine for a 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.950
 millimeter nothing happens 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.910
 and here 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.910
 we are in 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.110
 a centimeter and a half of what he wants 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.310
 to say that I'm missing a little more than 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.310
 pressure in the rear suspension 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.130
 we just squared already the pound g that 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:15.330
 we were missing in the rear suspension 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.640
 we proceed to put the covers and 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.709
 Finally very important that whenever 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:22.410
 let's do this the suspensions we have 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.880
 unblocking altogether is very important 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:25.480
 to regret that we always have them 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.030
 unlocked 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.670
 in these things and blocked you have to give 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.530
 two clicks down to make it 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:35.230
 blocked at all if they do not do this 

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.320
 they lose all the work and finally 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:40.840
 before we finish we are going to square the 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.910
 bounce of what we want with the 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.730
 rebound is that it is neither too slow nor too 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.920
 fast if the bicycle is too slow 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.290
 will be ready for the second blow 

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:52.390
 then the second blow we're going to 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:53.920
 absorb us but the bicycle what 

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.690
 same the rear screen and if it is very 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:57.370
 Quick 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.020
 the bicycle is going to behave like 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.940
 saying it so crazy is going to bounce a lot 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.800
 in the curves you can skid very 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.020
 easy because the tire bounces very fast 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.920
 you have to look for a point where it's fast 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:11.090
 but controlled 

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.090
 and we squared from here 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.440
 we give one more click to the outside so that 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:20.440
 a little faster 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:25.750
 there are we feel that regulates and the same the 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.570
 be back 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:31.420
 at this moment it's fine there where the 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.240
 we have those are the concepts 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:35.350
 basic to withdraw a suspension I hope 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:38.310
 that you have liked any question 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:38.310
 or form are written
