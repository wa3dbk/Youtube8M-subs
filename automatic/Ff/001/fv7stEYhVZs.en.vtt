00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.230 
good but I'd say it's average there's
not<00:01:43.409> real<00:01:43.649> major<00:01:43.979> in<00:01:44.310> dent<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:44.759> do<00:01:44.820> feel<00:01:45.210> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
not real major in dent I do feel a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.030 
not real major in dent I do feel a
little<00:01:45.630> bit<00:01:45.869> here<00:01:46.079> in<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.200> ceiling<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:46.649> you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
little bit here in the ceiling but you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.830 
little bit here in the ceiling but you
know<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.189> sit<00:01:47.430> tall<00:01:47.700> I'm<00:01:47.970> really<00:01:48.450> close<00:01:48.689> to

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
know I sit tall I'm really close to

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.960 
know I sit tall I'm really close to
hitting<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.350> that<00:01:49.950> being<00:01:50.220> said<00:01:50.490> if<00:01:50.790> you're

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
hitting it so that being said if you're

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.450 
hitting it so that being said if you're
over<00:01:51.360> six<00:01:51.659> foot<00:01:51.869> one<00:01:52.079> six<00:01:52.350> foot<00:01:52.530> two<00:01:52.710> you<00:01:53.220> may

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
over six foot one six foot two you may

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.950 
over six foot one six foot two you may
have<00:01:53.729> some<00:01:53.970> problems<00:01:54.119> in<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.479> back<00:01:54.659> seat<00:01:54.930> but

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
have some problems in the back seat but

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.380 
have some problems in the back seat but
I<00:01:55.110> think<00:01:55.470> that<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.219> seating<00:01:56.700> surface<00:01:57.060> makes

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
I think that the seating surface makes

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.060 
I think that the seating surface makes
up<00:01:57.600> for<00:01:57.780> some<00:01:57.930> of<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.049> maybe<00:01:58.829> if<00:01:58.950> you're

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
up for some of that maybe if you're

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.260 
up for some of that maybe if you're
shorter<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.460> makes<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.759> for<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.030> because

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
shorter it makes up for that because

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.270 
shorter it makes up for that because
this<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.540> extremely<00:02:00.780> comfortable<00:02:01.280> for

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
this is extremely comfortable for

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.249 
this is extremely comfortable for
passengers<00:02:02.460> you<00:02:03.240> also<00:02:03.420> have<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.659> climate

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
passengers you also have a climate

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.020 
passengers you also have a climate
control<00:02:04.590> for<00:02:04.799> both<00:02:04.920> passengers<00:02:05.520> back<00:02:05.700> here

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
we're talking about the difference

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.840 
we're talking about the difference
between<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.380> hybrid<00:02:43.860> Avalon<00:02:44.280> cargo<00:02:44.730> volume

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
between the hybrid Avalon cargo volume

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.120 
between the hybrid Avalon cargo volume
versus<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.480> regular<00:02:45.870> non-hybrid<00:02:46.560> you're

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
versus the regular non-hybrid you're

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.560 
versus the regular non-hybrid you're
going<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.340> lose<00:02:47.430> about<00:02:47.520> two<00:02:47.910> cubic<00:02:48.330> feet<00:02:48.450> of

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
going to lose about two cubic feet of

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.780 
going to lose about two cubic feet of
volume<00:02:48.840> right<00:02:49.350> here<00:02:49.380> 14<00:02:50.250> cubic<00:02:50.430> feet<00:02:50.610> of

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
volume right here 14 cubic feet of

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.020 
volume right here 14 cubic feet of
volume<00:02:51.060> versus<00:02:51.360> 16<00:02:51.870> in<00:02:52.110> a<00:02:52.530> non<00:02:52.769> hybrid<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.519> we

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
volume versus 16 in a non hybrid so we

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.479 
volume versus 16 in a non hybrid so we
can<00:02:54.150> still<00:02:54.390> manage<00:02:55.050> to<00:02:55.080> put<00:02:55.320> our<00:02:55.470> luggage<00:02:56.100> back

can still manage to put our luggage back
here<00:02:56.850> in<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.570> hybrid<00:02:58.110> version<00:02:58.730> like<00:02:59.730> so<00:03:00.620> yeah

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
here in the hybrid version like so yeah

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.620 
here in the hybrid version like so yeah

that now of course you have no
pass-through<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.220> seats<00:03:11.430> don't<00:03:11.580> fold

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
pass-through and the seats don't fold

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.550 
pass-through and the seats don't fold
down<00:03:12.060> because<00:03:12.420> right<00:03:12.930> here<00:03:13.170> in<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.320> backend

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
down because right here in the backend

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.860 
down because right here in the backend
is<00:03:13.950> where<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.190> have<00:03:14.400> all<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.150> electrical

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
is where you have all the electrical

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
and you can't even hear a startup in

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.800 
and you can't even hear a startup in
fact<00:03:45.660> if<00:03:46.049> I<00:03:46.140> hit<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.410> accelerator<00:03:47.720> there's<00:03:48.720> a

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
fact if I hit the accelerator there's a

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.070 
fact if I hit the accelerator there's a
little<00:03:49.230> bit<00:03:49.380> of<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.650> purr<00:03:50.010> and<00:03:50.400> that's<00:03:50.519> about<00:03:50.700> it

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:54.080 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.149 

now<00:03:55.080> there<00:03:55.230> are<00:03:55.349> three<00:03:55.620> driving<00:03:55.980> modes

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:56.159 
now there are three driving modes

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:59.240 
now there are three driving modes
there's<00:03:56.549> evey<00:03:56.970> mode<00:03:57.239> eco<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.140> sport<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.890> you

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
there's evey mode eco and sport and you

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.020 
there's evey mode eco and sport and you
can<00:03:59.430> drive<00:03:59.700> an<00:03:59.879> Eevee<00:04:00.269> mode<00:04:00.510> for<00:04:00.920> up<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.129> 2025

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
can drive an Eevee mode for up to 2025

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.770 
can drive an Eevee mode for up to 2025
miles<00:04:03.950> per<00:04:04.950> hour<00:04:05.129> before<00:04:05.579> it<00:04:05.879> kicks<00:04:06.239> over<00:04:06.450> into

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
miles per hour before it kicks over into

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.649 
miles per hour before it kicks over into
eco<00:04:07.340> so<00:04:08.340> if<00:04:08.489> you<00:04:08.610> are<00:04:08.790> an<00:04:08.909> Eevee<00:04:09.269> mode<00:04:09.480> it's

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:09.659 
eco so if you are an Eevee mode it's

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:11.149 
eco so if you are an Eevee mode it's
completely<00:04:10.140> electric<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.680> then<00:04:10.769> you<00:04:10.890> jump

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
completely electric and then you jump

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:14.059 
completely electric and then you jump
into<00:04:11.599> gasoline<00:04:12.599> and<00:04:12.810> economy<00:04:13.590> mode<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:13.799> mean<00:04:14.010> if

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
into gasoline and economy mode I mean if

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.430 
into gasoline and economy mode I mean if
you<00:04:14.129> want<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.310> go<00:04:14.430> all<00:04:14.640> power<00:04:15.269> with<00:04:15.569> fuel<00:04:15.930> then

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
you want to go all power with fuel then

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.229 
you want to go all power with fuel then
you're<00:04:16.650> in<00:04:16.919> sport<00:04:17.400> mode<00:04:17.430> and<00:04:17.850> you're<00:04:18.000> having<00:04:18.180> a

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 
you're in sport mode and you're having a

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:18.890 
you're in sport mode and you're having a
good<00:04:18.359> time

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
good time

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.840

between you and the car in front of you

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.960 
between you and the car in front of you
so<00:05:21.870> if<00:05:22.260> you're<00:05:22.470> set<00:05:22.770> at<00:05:22.919> 55<00:05:23.220> miles<00:05:23.639> per<00:05:23.789> hour

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:23.970 
so if you're set at 55 miles per hour

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.070 
so if you're set at 55 miles per hour
and<00:05:24.449> you<00:05:24.979> set<00:05:25.979> it<00:05:26.099> to<00:05:26.610> where<00:05:26.820> it's<00:05:27.539> the<00:05:27.780> full

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
and you set it to where it's the full

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.689 
and you set it to where it's the full
distance<00:05:28.620> let<00:05:28.919> me<00:05:29.010> set<00:05:29.220> this<00:05:29.310> in<00:05:29.460> right<00:05:29.610> now

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:29.699 
distance let me set this in right now

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:32.210 
distance let me set this in right now
right<00:05:29.970> already<00:05:30.349> you<00:05:31.349> can<00:05:31.530> have<00:05:31.740> it<00:05:31.889> to<00:05:32.039> where

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
right already you can have it to where

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.750 
right already you can have it to where
it's<00:05:32.780> radar<00:05:33.780> dynamic<00:05:34.680> radar<00:05:34.949> cruise<00:05:35.099> is<00:05:35.610> what

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
it's radar dynamic radar cruise is what

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.040 
it's radar dynamic radar cruise is what
they<00:05:35.849> call<00:05:36.090> it<00:05:36.210> so<00:05:36.360> you<00:05:36.419> can<00:05:36.599> set<00:05:36.780> the<00:05:36.870> distance

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:37.050 
they call it so you can set the distance

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:38.839 
they call it so you can set the distance
between<00:05:37.320> you<00:05:37.620> and<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.770> car<00:05:37.979> ahead<00:05:38.070> of<00:05:38.220> you<00:05:38.400> so

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:38.849 
between you and the car ahead of you so

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:41.689 
between you and the car ahead of you so
it'll<00:05:39.090> slow<00:05:39.539> down<00:05:39.620> based<00:05:40.620> on<00:05:40.830> that<00:05:41.010> distance<00:05:41.520> I

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:41.699 
it'll slow down based on that distance I

00:05:41.699 --> 00:05:44.149 
it'll slow down based on that distance I
hope<00:05:41.940> that<00:05:42.120> makes<00:05:42.300> sense<00:05:42.500> otherwise<00:05:43.500> you<00:05:44.039> know

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
hope that makes sense otherwise you know

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:46.219 
hope that makes sense otherwise you know
front-wheel<00:05:44.669> drive<00:05:44.699> it's<00:05:45.449> a<00:05:45.599> really<00:05:45.930> light

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
front-wheel drive it's a really light

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.040 
front-wheel drive it's a really light
steering<00:05:46.710> feel<00:05:47.250> I<00:05:47.520> find<00:05:48.210> it<00:05:48.330> very<00:05:48.360> controlled

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
steering feel I find it very controlled

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.100 
steering feel I find it very controlled
very<00:05:49.199> smooth<00:05:49.919> I<00:05:50.250> like<00:05:50.820> the<00:05:51.479> acceleration

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
very smooth I like the acceleration

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.920 
very smooth I like the acceleration
around<00:05:52.380> corners<00:05:52.940> overall<00:05:53.940> I<00:05:54.120> almost<00:05:54.599> would

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
around corners overall I almost would

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.469 
around corners overall I almost would
say<00:05:55.080> this<00:05:55.260> vehicle<00:05:55.650> floats<00:05:56.099> so<00:05:56.370> to<00:05:56.610> speak<00:05:56.909> when

00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 
say this vehicle floats so to speak when

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.170 
say this vehicle floats so to speak when
you're<00:05:57.599> driving<00:05:57.990> it's<00:05:58.380> a<00:05:58.889> semi<00:05:59.370> large<00:05:59.669> vehicle

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:00.180 
you're driving it's a semi large vehicle

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.170 
you're driving it's a semi large vehicle
less<00:06:00.840> than<00:06:01.050> 4,000<00:06:01.770> pounds<00:06:02.250> but<00:06:02.760> it<00:06:02.849> does<00:06:02.969> feel

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:03.180 
less than 4,000 pounds but it does feel

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:05.450 
less than 4,000 pounds but it does feel
nimble<00:06:03.719> and<00:06:03.840> light<00:06:04.139> on<00:06:04.349> its<00:06:04.500> feet

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:05.460 
nimble and light on its feet

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:11.450 
nimble and light on its feet
I<00:06:09.500> mentioned<00:06:10.500> this<00:06:10.590> earlier<00:06:10.830> about<00:06:11.100> the

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:11.460 
I mentioned this earlier about the

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.240 
I mentioned this earlier about the
sunscreen<00:06:12.449> the<00:06:12.660> back<00:06:12.900> here's<00:06:13.289> that<00:06:13.440> button

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
sunscreen the back here's that button

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:17.029 
sunscreen the back here's that button
and<00:06:14.460> there<00:06:15.060> pops<00:06:15.389> up<00:06:15.630> the<00:06:15.750> screen<00:06:16.110> cool<00:06:16.830> thing

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:17.039 
and there pops up the screen cool thing

00:06:17.039 --> 00:06:19.040 
and there pops up the screen cool thing
is<00:06:17.220> when<00:06:17.490> you<00:06:17.610> pop<00:06:17.849> it<00:06:18.030> into<00:06:18.150> reverse<00:06:18.330> that

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
is when you pop it into reverse that

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.870 
is when you pop it into reverse that
drops<00:06:19.440> down<00:06:19.650> to<00:06:20.039> increase<00:06:20.580> your<00:06:20.759> visibility

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
drops down to increase your visibility

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:22.879 
drops down to increase your visibility
so<00:06:21.539> if<00:06:21.630> it<00:06:21.750> is<00:06:21.840> a<00:06:21.870> hot<00:06:22.080> day<00:06:22.110> you<00:06:22.289> have<00:06:22.620> it<00:06:22.770> up

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:22.889 
so if it is a hot day you have it up

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:25.309 
so if it is a hot day you have it up
well<00:06:23.400> you<00:06:23.910> put<00:06:24.090> it<00:06:24.180> reverse<00:06:24.449> that<00:06:24.870> goes<00:06:25.110> down

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 
well you put it reverse that goes down

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:28.100 
well you put it reverse that goes down
kind<00:06:25.979> of<00:06:26.009> cool<00:06:26.160> for<00:06:27.150> demonstration<00:06:27.750> purposes

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:28.110 
kind of cool for demonstration purposes

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:29.749 
kind of cool for demonstration purposes
we're<00:06:28.259> going<00:06:28.380> to<00:06:28.440> drive<00:06:28.650> an<00:06:28.800> e<00:06:29.069> V<00:06:29.250> mode<00:06:29.550> just

00:06:29.749 --> 00:06:29.759 
we're going to drive an e V mode just

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:32.809 
we're going to drive an e V mode just
for<00:06:30.030> a<00:06:30.060> few<00:06:30.870> moments<00:06:31.259> we're<00:06:31.380> at<00:06:31.500> 23<00:06:32.009> 24<00:06:32.580> miles

00:06:32.809 --> 00:06:32.819 
for a few moments we're at 23 24 miles

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:36.230 
for a few moments we're at 23 24 miles
per<00:06:33.000> hour<00:06:33.419> I<00:06:33.870> accelerate<00:06:34.830> and<00:06:35.039> just<00:06:35.639> as<00:06:35.819> I<00:06:36.000> pass

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
per hour I accelerate and just as I pass

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.670 
per hour I accelerate and just as I pass
25<00:06:36.750> miles<00:06:37.139> per<00:06:37.410> hour

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:37.680 
25 miles per hour

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.060 
25 miles per hour
it<00:06:37.979> kicks<00:06:38.910> off<00:06:39.090> and<00:06:39.449> goes<00:06:39.870> into<00:06:40.080> Eco<00:06:40.560> mode<00:06:40.770> so

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:41.070 
it kicks off and goes into Eco mode so

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.060 
it kicks off and goes into Eco mode so
you<00:06:41.280> can<00:06:41.789> drive<00:06:42.090> on<00:06:42.120> electricity<00:06:42.720> up<00:06:43.139> to<00:06:43.530> 25

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.070 
you can drive on electricity up to 25

00:06:44.070 --> 00:06:46.700 
you can drive on electricity up to 25
miles<00:06:44.370> per<00:06:44.550> hour<00:06:44.729> and<00:06:45.180> save<00:06:45.810> all<00:06:46.050> the<00:06:46.259> gas<00:06:46.470> you

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:46.710 
miles per hour and save all the gas you

00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.740 
miles per hour and save all the gas you
want<00:06:46.949> but<00:06:47.160> once<00:06:47.370> you<00:06:47.520> go<00:06:47.639> over<00:06:47.669> 25<00:06:48.210> miles<00:06:48.570> per

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:48.750 
want but once you go over 25 miles per

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.439 
want but once you go over 25 miles per
hour<00:06:48.900> then<00:06:49.650> you're<00:06:49.830> into<00:06:50.070> econ<00:06:50.430> mode<00:06:50.669> I'm

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:51.449

00:06:51.449 --> 00:06:52.969 
hour then you're into econ mode I'm
probably<00:06:51.750> tipping<00:06:52.110> my<00:06:52.199> hat<00:06:52.229> a<00:06:52.410> little<00:06:52.590> bit<00:06:52.830> by

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 
probably tipping my hat a little bit by

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.460 
probably tipping my hat a little bit by
telling<00:06:53.370> you<00:06:53.520> I<00:06:53.729> do<00:06:54.030> like<00:06:54.599> how<00:06:54.900> comfortable

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:55.470 
telling you I do like how comfortable

telling you I do like how comfortable
the<00:06:55.620> Avalon<00:06:56.220> drives<00:06:56.639> I<00:06:57.060> know<00:06:57.449> it's<00:06:57.870> an<00:06:58.020> older

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
the Avalon drives I know it's an older

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.680 
the Avalon drives I know it's an older
demographic<00:06:59.430> but<00:06:59.610> that's<00:07:00.120> where<00:07:00.300> I<00:07:00.330> fit<00:07:00.659> in

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:00.690 
demographic but that's where I fit in

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:03.170 
demographic but that's where I fit in
now<00:07:00.960> as<00:07:01.139> an<00:07:01.289> a<00:07:01.409> person<00:07:02.039> 40<00:07:02.430> and<00:07:02.550> over<00:07:02.699> which<00:07:03.000> I

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
now as an a person 40 and over which I

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:05.870 
now as an a person 40 and over which I
know<00:07:03.389> many<00:07:03.630> of<00:07:03.840> you<00:07:04.050> who<00:07:04.530> are<00:07:04.560> watching<00:07:04.889> are<00:07:05.370> in

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:05.880 
know many of you who are watching are in

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.939 
know many of you who are watching are in
that<00:07:06.060> demographics<00:07:06.840> most<00:07:07.319> of<00:07:07.440> you<00:07:07.530> are<00:07:07.710> based

that demographics most of you are based
on<00:07:08.069> analytics<00:07:08.550> so<00:07:09.030> this<00:07:09.360> is<00:07:09.509> probably<00:07:09.780> a<00:07:09.840> car

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
on analytics so this is probably a car
