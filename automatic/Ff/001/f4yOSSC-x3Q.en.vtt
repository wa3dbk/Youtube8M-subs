 we also organized a kind of 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.200
 provincial coordination of three schools 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.910
 and we have also contacted gods 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.950
 university groups in this way 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.809
 we can throw bases for a 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.700
 coordination a little more spent the formula 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.739
 found agree teachers and 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.200
 students show tolerance also the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.960
 school manager anna rita durantini 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.829
 that recognizes a formative value 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.989
 at the initiative the boys are 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.210
 responsibly organized and you are 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.780
 busy cleaning up the classrooms after the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.530
 night 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.539
 we must of course be careful 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.010
 watch over I have to say that there 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.780
 they are also surveillance groups 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.340
 of course by even the guys I 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.250
 last night they came saw that 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.560
 in short, there is a sense of responsibility 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.570
 less protection for public schools and cuts 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.460
 continue the principal confirms that the 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.799
 event has motivations 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.259
 shareable schools are always more 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.540
 poor and could be because now 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.610
 we must see them on paper in short 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.700
 also for remedial courses for 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.570
 example it is indisputable that the support 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.190
 who give us 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.440
 and with their contributions it begins to 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.870
 become meaningful to us 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.450
 for example very busy with 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.640
 IT innovation also in the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.760
 teaching that we are always gearing up for 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.990
 more also in terms of investments 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.810
 just no type and interactive whiteboards 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.150
 to yield this, however, of course 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.160
 means an investment then money 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.990
 that we must find somewhere 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.600
 we don't want to hold back 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:00.100
 we want school to always be like 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.970
 it is said to be in step with the times 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.970
