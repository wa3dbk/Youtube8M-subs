00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 it seems that the week has been 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.270
 presented with many to the being of 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.160
 order is on everyone's lips except in the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:11.000
 I started the review of the news 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.000
 of the week 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:30.490
 we start strong with the typical question 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.850
 that breaks couples beach or mountain that in 

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.190
 playstation 4 or xbox one we put the 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.410
 pasta glasses we caught the calculator and 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.050
 the time machine and you're here 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.809
 we are in 2019 with some statistics 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.970
 who hiccup a report of 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.260
 strategy analytics reveals that console 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.290
 will be the most sold according to 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.989
 forecasts for this year to see the redoubled 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.550
 of drums then and playstation 4 will 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.370
 He would boost the top spot since 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.850
 estimate that it will sell 80 million 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.800
 Xbox consoles would stay at 57 million 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.899
 for the price problems at 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.000
 start of generation both consoles 

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:09.130
 improve the pace of sales that their 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.070
 predecessors fact that we must highlight 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.440
 there's no wii data but you're also 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.190
 recovering so my summary after 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.259
 of this is long life to consoles and 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.780
 you know this is like the dog of 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.030
 gardener who neither eats nor lets eat but 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.550
 this time the dog is a chicken dog 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.350
 giant, yes, even if it bothers us 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.240
 we all want to see it once and for all 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.790
 all so please 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.770
 to play with our feelings as 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.390
 already happened before in 2012 to 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.340
 be more accurate good and lost the mark 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.409
 of the game you already know that the theme of 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.210
 records there are expiration dates then 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.250
 well this week are and has denied that 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.470
 pass pickles of guardian fabrics and has 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.750
 returned to recover it in addition to confirm 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.520
 that is still in development without having to 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.830
 be very clever we intuit that this 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.899
 game will be if God wants to 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.090
 playstation 4 although it was announced for 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.100
 playstation3 but clear to this step 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.740
 maybe we play them in holograms in 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.490
 playstation 5 who knows how to dadle 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.920
 chips since we have it already light fire 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.220
 destruction all-in-one and also in 2d 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.500
 the alien returns with monkey tail 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.810
 good good good and preparing yours 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.250

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.690
 someone has gathered the seven balls of 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.910

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.730
