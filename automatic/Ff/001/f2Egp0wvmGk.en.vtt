00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
with the front the solar panels tell me

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:33.809 
with the front the solar panels tell me
in<00:03:26.290> the<00:03:26.409> cab<00:03:26.620> actually<00:03:31.530> and<00:03:32.530> they<00:03:32.650> just<00:03:33.189> help

you<00:03:38.560> know<00:03:38.680> and<00:03:39.040> that's<00:03:39.190> good<00:03:39.400> for<00:03:39.579> a<00:03:39.640> long<00:03:39.819> life

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
you know and that's good for a long life

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.360 
you know and that's good for a long life
to<00:03:40.269> a<00:03:40.299> battery<00:03:40.540> oh<00:03:40.930> yeah<00:03:41.109> absolutely<00:03:41.560> he's

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
to a battery oh yeah absolutely he's

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.369 
to a battery oh yeah absolutely he's
just<00:03:42.489> doing<00:03:42.790> five<00:03:43.030> miles<00:03:43.389> maybe<00:03:43.720> I<00:03:43.989> don't<00:03:44.200> need

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:44.379 
just doing five miles maybe I don't need

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:45.899 
just doing five miles maybe I don't need
to<00:03:44.470> do<00:03:44.680> this<00:03:44.829> you<00:03:45.010> know<00:03:45.099> how<00:03:45.190> it<00:03:45.250> works<00:03:45.489> yeah<00:03:45.879> I

00:03:45.899 --> 00:03:45.909 
to do this you know how it works yeah I

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:47.339 
to do this you know how it works yeah I
know<00:03:45.970> if<00:03:46.269> you're<00:03:46.450> if<00:03:46.659> you're<00:03:46.750> driving<00:03:46.989> five

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:47.349 
know if you're if you're driving five

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:49.860 
know if you're if you're driving five
miles<00:03:47.680> and<00:03:48.159> then<00:03:48.700> it<00:03:48.909> sits<00:03:49.209> in<00:03:49.389> the<00:03:49.480> Sun<00:03:49.690> all

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
miles and then it sits in the Sun all

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.539 
miles and then it sits in the Sun all
day<00:03:49.900> would<00:03:50.440> it<00:03:50.470> probably<00:03:50.829> charge<00:03:51.040> it<00:03:51.190> back<00:03:51.220> up

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
day would it probably charge it back up

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.420 
day would it probably charge it back up
at<00:03:52.060> five<00:03:52.359> miles<00:03:52.629> so<00:03:52.959> that's<00:03:53.109> three<00:03:53.590> mile<00:03:54.040> about

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
at five miles so that's three mile about

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.270 
at five miles so that's three mile about
300<00:03:55.000> watts<00:03:55.239> yeah<00:03:56.019> so<00:03:56.319> if<00:03:56.409> you<00:03:56.530> read<00:03:56.769> close<00:03:57.099> in

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
300 watts yeah so if you read close in

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.729 
300 watts yeah so if you read close in
five<00:03:57.459> oil<00:03:57.760> today<00:03:58.030> you<00:03:58.900> could<00:03:59.079> probably<00:03:59.319> get<00:03:59.590> by

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
five oil today you could probably get by

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:02.339 
five oil today you could probably get by
with<00:03:59.920> just<00:03:59.950> the<00:04:00.250> solar<00:04:00.840> that's<00:04:01.840> cool<00:04:02.109> if

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:02.349 
with just the solar that's cool if

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:03.839 
with just the solar that's cool if
you're<00:04:02.530> just<00:04:02.680> doing<00:04:02.859> the<00:04:03.040> five<00:04:03.280> or<00:04:03.430> six<00:04:03.639> miles

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:03.849 
you're just doing the five or six miles

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.599 
you're just doing the five or six miles
a<00:04:04.030> day<00:04:04.090> hey<00:04:04.810> let's<00:04:05.049> take<00:04:05.170> a<00:04:05.200> quick<00:04:05.409> drive<00:04:05.650> put
