00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.130
 speaks guys who beauty to the other 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.870
 cardoso showing in this video here to 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:21.000
 you the difference between a led bulb 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:01:32.520
 blue and yellow 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:02:09.229
 then I'll show you common and 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:02:13.340
 store because with the lamp lock then 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.340
 if you look down there 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.900
 and that brown film is precisely 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.200
 that connector I'm going to have to take 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.300
 to change the show lamp so pulled 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.400
 It is very easy to have no lock 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.460
 only generate a little by one 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.350
 side to the other just to take a spin 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.650
 even to help him out there 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.650
 folks 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:48.690
 I removed an ac adapter 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:52.740
 You can see that I really try. 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:03:02.190
 show you an ac adapter 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:03:04.500
 The connector on the connector has two 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.310
 there you will fit the 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.430
 led bulb 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.790
 tip if you have removed this connector 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.940
 the lighthouse tries to pull straight is not good to come 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.709
 not to leave the crooked angle because the 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.810
 The lamp may twist and fall inside the 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.910
 lighthouse to get out of the forum only 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.940
 taking out beyond the headlight that is glued etc 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.680
 give a job depending on the money 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:31.050
 that you can spend and or if you do not 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.880
 know how to do this will end up getting 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.350
 inside the lighthouse so be careful okay 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.630
 on a crooked wrist 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.070
 I'll put another light here and come back 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.070
 to the connector inside 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.420
 I already put the lamp here 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.530
 before actually putting in I do not know if 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.459
 I said now just before I put it there. 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.799
 inside 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.420
 I see a silver pole is positive and 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.850
 negative 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.560
 so if you're not sure which 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.390
 positive and negative places 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.440
 The lamp entered the car and the 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:11.610
 alloy car there yes you fit 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:13.350
 I could show a cell phone and it will not 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:18.410
 be very easy to achieve with the 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:18.410
 wiring and with this forum cat 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.930
 the people 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.030
 I changed 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:31.120
 there the two actually the raw lamp 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.830
 flashlight for the headlight under this lamp 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.590
 higher up behind this 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.669
 protection then hire when the land 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.669
 is with the penguin band 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:52.660
 the two also say destroyed 

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:54.430
 We need to change it can be observed by 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:05:00.240
 because of the slow 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.240
 the protection in account 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:10.810
 I put the lamp more or less 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:14.820
 same way down the side of the other 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.820
 so crossed 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.830
 two-sided 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.400
 the guys until the next video a hug and 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.400
 bye
