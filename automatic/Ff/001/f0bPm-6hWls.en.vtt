00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.880
 Hello everyone and welcome to our 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.590
 Paraguayan food preparation video 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.540
 now we are going to teach you how to make a 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.870
 typical Paraguayan dish that is the one 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.870
 you must 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.240
 and here we have pumpkin 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.710
 we have oil 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.520
 Salt 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:32.070
 cream cheese corn flour 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:36.890
 water and sugar 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:43.140
 the particularity of this dish our 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:45.810
 is that they carry the salt and carry the sugar 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.620
 when you are going to eat 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:54.360
 with meat or beef is that it is an option 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:58.100
 you put more salt and when 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:03.460
 is going to eat as dessert gets more 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:07.299
 amount of sugar generally 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:11.440
 it takes half and half as long as 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:15.240
 that is a semi sweet and salty too 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.240
 pumpkin tonight 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.210
 that now we're going 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.210
 to download 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.210
 10 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.520
 so that this softens here there is a very 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.860
 important to keep in mind 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.150
 the pumpkin when cooking long enough 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.490
 water then 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.490
 the water that we are going to use 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:47.240
 only until the food is cured 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:56.790
 well only without any other 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:02:01.310
 Water and pumpkin ingredient we take to 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.310
 fire until the pumpkin softens 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.740
 here we have 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.509
 the mashed pumpkin 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.189
 so 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.189
 we are doing more 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.740
 a poor fine 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:26.180
 we are adding to play the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.180
 pumpkin 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.240
 we make our mash 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.280
 eibar 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.940
 let say 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.280
 in the pumpkin 1 

00:02:52.470 --> 00:03:00.660
 this as you see is boiling 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.480
 we go throwing the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.990
 if this is seasoning here we have 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.990
 our oil 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.890
 always stirring 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.280
 we miss 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.280
 our salt 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:26.799
 Y 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.799
 the sugar 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.480
 up here as we always say and 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.000
 We emphasize that if you want it as a dessert 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.900
 more amount is put 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.900
 to sugar 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.000
 and it is served cold 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:52.790
 now we are going to add it little by little 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.790
 corn flour 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.670
 and stirring 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.430
 then he is cooking 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.430
 constantly stirring 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.680
 It's like a polenta 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.320
 but with the pumpkin 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:33.660
 as you were seeing it is becoming 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.660
 more solid 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.950
 is cooking 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.380
 a little more 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:49.309
 and here we add the cream cheese 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.389
 two 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:01.830
 we are constantly stirring 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:01.830
 until 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:07.340
 mixing whales melting the 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.340
 cheese 

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:15.029
 and at this point 

00:05:10.569 --> 00:05:15.029
 and all our baby is already 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.190
 all the cheese melted 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:30.250
 there is 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:41.789
 everything is also cooked 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.789
 amount of mike flour that carries 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:50.250
 and at this point we turn off 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:02.759
 let's make fire 

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:13.759
 and this we overturn in a 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:13.759
 container 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.949
 there 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:23.949
 the finished dish 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:32.930
 this if they go or if they are going to eat with meat 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.270
 then so hot and if they want 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:38.030
 as it is preferred as dessert then 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.720
 this is carried to the wood and served 

00:06:38.030 --> 00:06:44.520
 very cold 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.520
 our command is finished
