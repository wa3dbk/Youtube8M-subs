00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:10.780
 friends , welcome to another video of this 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.630
 I would like to recommend a game to 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.980
 you a game that I paid around 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.320
 One hundred reais 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.789
 It's a game that incredibly delivers 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.669
 just what he promises 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.380
 deliver're an experienced experience 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.659
 the next generation of the largest 

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.060
 games and do not forget that it's written 

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.630
 here and be aware of what I'm going 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.539
 speak 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:34.090
 we're talking about less game simulator 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.500
 released yesterday to inesting it was also 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.720
 released to the console only to 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:40.270
 consolidate a wrong version of the game in 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.400
 That a silly little game of fighting is more 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.280
 if you're a guy like me who got the 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.930
 version for pc you will finish 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.750
 noting that the game is the least 

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.320
 simulator and - simulator whatever it is 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:55.210
 simulator - you enter the game and 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.670
 when the flight the more you stay in 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.890
 menu or more points of anger you win 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.500
 It's because you can not do it. 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.740
 other things besides being on the menu 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.390
 The game the deadly kombat game because as 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.700
 said that at least one reader 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.549
 He saw the cat completely and what 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.469
 It gets really annoying but at the same time I 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.999

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.549
 opportunity to play this thing

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.689
 streaming installation that allows 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.639

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.140

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:37.599
 Because this is just the boy, are you? 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.580

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.250
 things like that and this is all 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.799
 fun that the staff at least 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:53.920
 the year in contact and in the forums of 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:56.110
 Steam managed to have it's game he was 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.720

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.690

 today, day 14 as a day of delay 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.690
 only unfortunately the steam promised 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.430
 something and could not deliver everything 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.640
 each well that happens we try 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.980
 enter here in single fight the game 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.049
 simply closes because because it is 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:22.780
 the simulator menu is what is the 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.489
 game that simulates - and if you try to do 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.680
 something different from staying 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.920
 inside the menu you end up being expelled 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.780
 kicked of the game which is very well legal of 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.480
 But the crowd stays here, my 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:36.910
 small criticism the people of the extinct 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.640
 All the game is released, but it's okay. 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.160
 this is it this release date 13 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.480

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.579
 Too bad she was let in the comments

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.569
 you can play the game and also 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:06.459
 leave it here if you have contained the problem and 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.290
 got some sort of solution because 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.150
 This way I can move forward but 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.670

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.530
