00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.249 
was gonna end the game because it shows
on<00:04:38.360> the<00:04:38.389> kill<00:04:38.629> feed<00:04:38.780> right<00:04:38.960> there<00:04:39.139> that

00:04:39.249 --> 00:04:39.259 
on the kill feed right there that

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:41.740 
on the kill feed right there that
somebody<00:04:39.560> got<00:04:39.680> another<00:04:39.889> kill<00:04:40.159> and<00:04:40.479> I<00:04:41.479> thought

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
somebody got another kill and I thought

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:42.790 
somebody got another kill and I thought
this<00:04:41.870> was<00:04:41.990> going<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.169> end<00:04:42.259> the<00:04:42.440> game<00:04:42.470> but
