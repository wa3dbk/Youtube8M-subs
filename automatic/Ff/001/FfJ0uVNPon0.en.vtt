little bit of advice on equipment and
how<00:00:21.000> to<00:00:21.060> scuba<00:00:21.390> dive<00:00:21.859> okay<00:00:22.859> let's<00:00:23.070> take<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.310> look

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
how to scuba dive okay let's take a look

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.230 
how to scuba dive okay let's take a look
at<00:00:23.640> how<00:00:23.820> scuba<00:00:24.570> regulators<00:00:25.109> work<00:00:26.090> we've<00:00:27.090> got<00:00:27.210> a

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
at how scuba regulators work we've got a

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.890 
at how scuba regulators work we've got a
tank<00:00:27.510> here<00:00:27.750> BCD<00:00:28.439> and<00:00:29.060> some<00:00:30.060> regs<00:00:30.269> attached<00:00:30.630> to

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
tank here BCD and some regs attached to

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.940 
tank here BCD and some regs attached to
it<00:00:32.149> firstly<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:34.050> first<00:00:34.350> stage<00:00:34.710> is

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
it firstly that the the first stage is

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.560 
it firstly that the the first stage is
we<00:00:35.070> call<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.430> up<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> regulator<00:00:35.969> screws<00:00:36.360> into

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
we call you up the regulator screws into

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.660 
we call you up the regulator screws into
the<00:00:36.690> tank<00:00:36.989> itself<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.770> what<00:00:37.920> that's<00:00:38.129> doing<00:00:38.309> is

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
the tank itself and what that's doing is

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.060 
the tank itself and what that's doing is
its<00:00:39.239> connecting<00:00:40.020> all<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.379> various<00:00:40.680> hoses

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
its connecting all of the various hoses

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.209 
its connecting all of the various hoses
up<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.399> tank<00:00:41.700> and<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.930> also<00:00:43.219> reducing

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
up to the tank and it's also reducing

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.090 
up to the tank and it's also reducing
the<00:00:44.250> pressure<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.850> tank<00:00:44.879> from<00:00:45.539> about<00:00:46.410> 200

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
the pressure in the tank from about 200

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.040 
the pressure in the tank from about 200
times<00:00:47.309> atmospheric<00:00:48.030> pressure<00:00:48.270> down<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.660> about

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
times atmospheric pressure down to about

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.290 
times atmospheric pressure down to about
10<00:00:49.350> times<00:00:49.649> atmospheric<00:00:50.579> pressure<00:00:50.820> so<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
10 times atmospheric pressure so it's a

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.750 
10 times atmospheric pressure so it's a
it's<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.809> pressure<00:00:52.079> reducing<00:00:53.039> device<00:00:53.460> if<00:00:53.730> you

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
it's a pressure reducing device if you

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.090 
it's a pressure reducing device if you
like<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.629> that<00:00:54.660> then<00:00:54.989> as<00:00:55.230> we<00:00:55.350> said<00:00:55.590> a<00:00:55.770> second

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
like and that then as we said a second

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.750 
like and that then as we said a second
ago<00:00:56.160> feeds<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.960> air<00:00:58.230> out<00:00:58.530> to<00:00:58.859> all<00:00:59.129> the<00:00:59.340> gas<00:00:59.520> out

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
ago feeds the air out to all the gas out

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.729 
ago feeds the air out to all the gas out
to<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> various<00:01:00.449> regulators<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.410> main<00:01:01.590> one

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
to the various regulators the main one

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:02.959 
to the various regulators the main one
that<00:01:01.770> we<00:01:01.890> put<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.160> our<00:01:02.250> mouth<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.609> just<00:01:02.640> there

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
that we put in our mouth is just there

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.070 
that we put in our mouth is just there
you<00:01:03.090> can<00:01:03.239> see<00:01:03.359> that's<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.690> slightly<00:01:03.960> shorter

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
you can see that's on a slightly shorter

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.730 
you can see that's on a slightly shorter
black<00:01:04.619> hose<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.570> will<00:01:06.810> give<00:01:07.020> you<00:01:07.170> air<00:01:07.380> at

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
black hose and this will give you air at

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.200 
black hose and this will give you air at
the<00:01:08.070> same<00:01:08.310> pressure<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.880> you're<00:01:09.060> at

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
the same pressure that you're at

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.850 
the same pressure that you're at
wherever<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.840> are<00:01:09.869> in<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> water<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:10.710> on<00:01:10.740> the

regulator<00:01:29.030> scuba-diving<00:01:30.030> is<00:01:30.210> an<00:01:30.270> incredibly

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
regulator scuba-diving is an incredibly

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.330 
regulator scuba-diving is an incredibly
safe<00:01:30.900> sport<00:01:31.229> one<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.710> ways<00:01:31.860> that<00:01:31.890> we<00:01:32.159> make

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
safe sport one of the ways that we make

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.810 
safe sport one of the ways that we make
it<00:01:32.520> safe<00:01:32.790> is<00:01:33.299> we<00:01:33.840> always<00:01:33.990> carry<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:35.009> spare

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
it safe is we always carry a spare

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.740 
it safe is we always carry a spare
emergency<00:01:38.090> version<00:01:39.090> of<00:01:39.150> everything<00:01:39.479> that<00:01:39.600> we

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
emergency version of everything that we

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.870 
emergency version of everything that we
need<00:01:39.990> you<00:01:40.710> know<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.920> keep<00:01:41.040> a<00:01:41.189> safe<00:01:41.369> underwater

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
need you know to keep a safe underwater

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.149 
need you know to keep a safe underwater
so<00:01:42.270> should<00:01:42.899> our<00:01:42.960> body's<00:01:43.320> regulator<00:01:43.740> not<00:01:43.979> work

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
so should our body's regulator not work

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.520 
so should our body's regulator not work
they<00:01:44.369> can<00:01:44.520> come<00:01:44.729> over<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.180> use<00:01:45.450> our<00:01:45.990> regulator

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
they can come over and use our regulator

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.499 
they can come over and use our regulator
our<00:01:46.770> spare<00:01:47.159> regulator<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.909> that's<00:01:48.090> that<00:01:48.299> one

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
our spare regulator so that's that one

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.960 
our spare regulator so that's that one
there<00:01:49.040> again<00:01:50.040> very<00:01:50.070> similar<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.820> first

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
there again very similar to the first

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.179 
there again very similar to the first
one<00:01:51.119> does<00:01:51.420> the<00:01:51.570> same<00:01:51.780> job<00:01:51.920> over<00:01:52.920> on<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.070> other

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189

side<00:01:53.460> we<00:01:53.640> have<00:01:53.759> a<00:01:53.790> pressure<00:01:54.060> gauge<00:01:54.329> which

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
side we have a pressure gauge which

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.020 
side we have a pressure gauge which
tells<00:01:54.960> us<00:01:55.110> how<00:01:55.290> much<00:01:55.500> air<00:01:56.460> we've<00:01:56.700> got<00:01:56.850> in<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
tells us how much air we've got in the

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.330 
tells us how much air we've got in the
tank<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.420> can<00:01:57.540> see<00:01:57.689> that's<00:01:57.869> reading<00:01:58.170> 250<00:01:59.159> bar

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
tank you can see that's reading 250 bar

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.249 
tank you can see that's reading 250 bar
and<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.700> went<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.000> full<00:02:00.270> tank<00:02:00.540> of<00:02:00.659> gas<00:02:00.719> there

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and I went to a full tank of gas there

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.920 
and I went to a full tank of gas there
and<00:02:01.530> also<00:02:02.159> some<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.640> them<00:02:02.729> have<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:02.939> fairly

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
and also some of them have a fairly

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.149 
and also some of them have a fairly
basic<00:02:04.140> kind<00:02:04.680> of<00:02:04.770> depth<00:02:05.280> gauge<00:02:05.579> that

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
basic kind of depth gauge that

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.880 
basic kind of depth gauge that
how<00:02:06.369> deep<00:02:06.640> you<00:02:06.789> are<00:02:06.850> in<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.179> water<00:02:07.359> okay<00:02:08.140> also

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
how deep you are in the water okay also

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.400 
how deep you are in the water okay also
attached<00:02:09.429> to<00:02:09.849> the<00:02:10.030> the<00:02:10.569> first<00:02:10.810> stage<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.290> the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
attached to the the first stage of the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:13.860 
attached to the the first stage of the
regulator<00:02:11.769> you<00:02:12.129> have<00:02:12.340> a<00:02:12.670> hose<00:02:13.060> going<00:02:13.420> down<00:02:13.629> to

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
regulator you have a hose going down to

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.380 
regulator you have a hose going down to
the<00:02:14.019> inflator<00:02:14.769> on<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.129> BCD<00:02:15.489> on<00:02:15.819> your<00:02:15.910> buoyancy

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
the inflator on the BCD on your buoyancy

the inflator on the BCD on your buoyancy
compensation<00:02:17.170> device<00:02:17.440> and<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:19.239> bottom<00:02:19.540> there

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
compensation device and the bottom there

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.020 
compensation device and the bottom there
puts<00:02:20.500> air<00:02:20.709> in<00:02:20.920> and<00:02:21.310> normally<00:02:21.790> there's<00:02:21.970> a

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
puts air in and normally there's a

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.030 
puts air in and normally there's a
button<00:02:22.209> on<00:02:22.360> top<00:02:22.599> or<00:02:22.810> just<00:02:22.959> on<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.140> side<00:02:23.440> which

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 
button on top or just on the side which

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.009 
button on top or just on the side which
lets<00:02:24.310> air<00:02:24.580> out<00:02:24.819> so<00:02:25.360> basically<00:02:25.750> we're<00:02:25.989> using

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
lets air out so basically we're using

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:29.280 
lets air out so basically we're using
this<00:02:26.620> in<00:02:27.459> to<00:02:28.180> explain<00:02:28.510> in<00:02:28.660> simple<00:02:28.840> terms<00:02:29.170> we're

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
this in to explain in simple terms we're

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.150 
this in to explain in simple terms we're
using<00:02:29.410> this<00:02:29.590> like<00:02:29.769> kind<00:02:29.920> of<00:02:30.010> like<00:02:30.129> a

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
using this like kind of like a

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.890 
using this like kind of like a
lifejacket<00:02:30.430> when<00:02:31.030> we're<00:02:31.150> on<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.269> surface<00:02:31.780> to

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
lifejacket when we're on the surface to

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.470 
lifejacket when we're on the surface to
keep<00:02:32.019> us<00:02:32.170> afloat<00:02:32.290> and<00:02:33.040> when<00:02:33.220> we're<00:02:33.370> underwater

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
keep us afloat and when we're underwater

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.640 
keep us afloat and when we're underwater
we're<00:02:34.480> putting<00:02:34.750> little<00:02:34.959> bits<00:02:35.110> of<00:02:35.230> air<00:02:35.379> in<00:02:35.530> and

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
we're putting little bits of air in and

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.229 
we're putting little bits of air in and
out<00:02:35.769> to<00:02:35.980> keep<00:02:36.160> us<00:02:36.340> at<00:02:36.489> the<00:02:36.580> right<00:02:36.700> level<00:02:37.060> in<00:02:37.150> the

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
out to keep us at the right level in the

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.699 
out to keep us at the right level in the
water<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.720> we're<00:02:37.989> what<00:02:38.440> we<00:02:38.530> call

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
water so that we're what we call

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.650 
water so that we're what we call
neutrally<00:02:39.250> buoyant<00:02:39.280> so<00:02:40.180> that's<00:02:40.329> a<00:02:40.420> little

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
neutrally buoyant so that's a little

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.050 
neutrally buoyant so that's a little
