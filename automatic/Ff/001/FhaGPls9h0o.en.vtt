00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.240
 my father died of a heart attack 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.410
 the age of 55 I wanted to know what 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.880
 are the risks of having a heart attack 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.170
 knowing that I inherited the temperament 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.170
 anxious and that the rhone my dad 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.740
 that's it before answering your question 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.510
 I would like to know dr gas if all 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.040
 anxious and stressed temperaments have 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.689
 more risk than others to do 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:26.670
 a heart attack or if it's just an idea 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.590
 received will of course have many 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.480
 studies have shown that stressed people 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.680
 had a little luck of course of 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.629
 to contract problems 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.500
 cardiovascular among other diseases 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.199
 but there we talk about diseases 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.480
 cardiovascular it takes a little bit 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.980
 dissociate the good from the bad stress the 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.629
 good stress is the business leader 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.699
 who has his business that works well he 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.290
 works 20 hours a day 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.940
 that's the good stress and the bad 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.010
 stress is the business leader who 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.879
 owes a lot of money and who knows he 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.769
 can not refund them 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.970
 that's the bad stress not 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:55.680
 I hope for you it's good stress 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:56.879
 but in fact your real question is 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.589
 is what are the risks for me of 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.650
 to make an infarction knowing that my dad 

00:00:58.589 --> 00:01:04.589
 died at age 55 then it's true 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:05.909
 that heredity counts a little bit when 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.630
 even 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.700
 concerning diseases 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.960
 cardiovascular we have a little bit more 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.460
 chance to contract a pathology 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.119
 cardiovascular when we have a parent 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.590
 live who have been hit ben on 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.970
 will still reassured paul all 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.470
 infarction do not occur so 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.700
 massive and brutal there are signs 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.540
 before runners of course not then 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.010
 on the one hand once in a 20 infarction 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.330
 and massive on the other hand 9 pains 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.890
 thoracic in ten are not 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.200
 of cardiac origin - on a little bit 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.780
 people otherwise I will work until 6 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.280
 am daily 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.800
 the pains on which one must be 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.050
 vigilant these are pains that 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.360
 occur earlier in the effort 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.580
 pain of all types of burns 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.360
 sensations of two genes from 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.420
 compression etc 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.520
 but of course massive infarction 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.080
 thankfully it's relatively rare 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.640
 in any case, there is no 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.409
 fatality in all this so have a 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.370
 good hygiene and especially stay 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.370
 Zen and everything will be fine
