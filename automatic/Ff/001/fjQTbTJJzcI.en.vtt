gun<00:01:24.539> because<00:01:24.780> to<00:01:24.990> me<00:01:25.140> playing<00:01:25.979> with<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.610> full

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
gun because to me playing with a full

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.550 
gun because to me playing with a full
team<00:01:27.119> playing<00:01:27.420> with<00:01:27.569> subscribers<00:01:27.780> it's<00:01:28.350> too

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
team playing with subscribers it's too

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.469 
team playing with subscribers it's too
easy<00:01:28.590> for<00:01:29.280> me<00:01:29.399> to<00:01:29.429> flank<00:01:29.789> behind<00:01:30.149> the<00:01:30.270> enemy

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
easy for me to flank behind the enemy

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.109 
easy for me to flank behind the enemy
team<00:01:30.690> and<00:01:30.960> start<00:01:31.289> going<00:01:31.440> ham<00:01:31.770> on<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> on<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
team and start going ham on the on the

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
team and start going ham on the on the
enemies<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.560> would<00:01:34.830> put<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.069> an<00:01:35.159> assault

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
enemies so I would put on an assault

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.370 
enemies so I would put on an assault
rifle<00:01:35.460> which<00:01:35.850> forces<00:01:36.210> me<00:01:36.360> into<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.659> slower<00:01:37.080> pace

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
rifle which forces me into a slower pace

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.999 
rifle which forces me into a slower pace
more<00:01:37.679> defensive<00:01:38.340> role<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:39.770> especially<00:01:40.770> when

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
more defensive role and especially when

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.290 
more defensive role and especially when
you're<00:01:41.099> using<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.429> class<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.819> this<00:01:41.849> I<00:01:42.149> mean<00:01:42.239> I

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:42.300 
you're using a class like this I mean I

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.650 
you're using a class like this I mean I
got<00:01:42.539> ak-47s<00:01:43.819> ounce<00:01:44.819> or<00:01:45.030> an<00:01:45.119> extended<00:01:45.420> mag

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:45.660 
got ak-47s ounce or an extended mag

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.229 
got ak-47s ounce or an extended mag
which<00:01:45.959> is<00:01:46.590> pretty<00:01:46.860> good<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.670> I<00:01:47.729> also<00:01:47.970> got

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:48.239 
which is pretty good and then I also got

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:50.839 
which is pretty good and then I also got
the<00:01:48.420> m16<00:01:49.080> red<00:01:49.319> dot<00:01:49.530> rapid<00:01:49.920> fire<00:01:50.129> so<00:01:50.610> I<00:01:50.640> don't

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
the m16 red dot rapid fire so I don't

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:53.150 
the m16 red dot rapid fire so I don't
even<00:01:50.970> have<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.179> suppressor<00:01:51.690> on<00:01:51.750> this<00:01:51.979> red<00:01:52.979> dot

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
even have a suppressor on this red dot

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.790 
even have a suppressor on this red dot
rapid<00:01:53.459> fire<00:01:53.610> m16<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.300> probably<00:01:54.599> the<00:01:54.869> best<00:01:55.140> m16

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
rapid fire m16 is probably the best m16

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.740 
rapid fire m16 is probably the best m16
setup<00:01:56.459> that<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.729> can<00:01:56.849> put<00:01:57.030> out<00:01:57.060> there<00:01:57.360> other

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
setup that you can put out there other

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.809 
setup that you can put out there other
than<00:01:57.929> maybe<00:01:58.319> red<00:01:58.770> dot<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:58.979> sound<00:01:59.340> sir

00:01:59.809 --> 00:01:59.819 
than maybe red dot and sound sir

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.389 
than maybe red dot and sound sir
I<00:01:59.849> don't<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.810> silencer<00:02:01.440> rapid<00:02:01.830> fire<00:02:02.039> on<00:02:02.280> them

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
I don't like silencer rapid fire on them

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.359 
I don't like silencer rapid fire on them
16<00:02:02.819> for<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.209> simple<00:02:03.569> fact<00:02:03.599> that<00:02:04.220> when<00:02:05.220> you

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
16 for the simple fact that when you

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.820 
16 for the simple fact that when you
when<00:02:05.729> you<00:02:05.879> uh<00:02:05.910> when<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.869> put<00:02:07.019> on<00:02:07.110> silencer<00:02:07.590> it

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
when you uh when you put on silencer it

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.499 
when you uh when you put on silencer it
kind<00:02:08.039> of<00:02:08.099> takes<00:02:08.310> away<00:02:08.550> a<00:02:08.580> little<00:02:08.759> bit<00:02:08.879> of<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
kind of takes away a little bit of the

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.570 
kind of takes away a little bit of the
power<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:10.050> feels<00:02:10.289> like<00:02:10.500> and<00:02:10.739> then<00:02:11.190> on<00:02:11.310> top<00:02:11.519> of

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
power it feels like and then on top of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.330 
power it feels like and then on top of
that<00:02:12.110> you<00:02:13.110> don't<00:02:13.200> have<00:02:13.379> a<00:02:13.410> red<00:02:13.620> dot<00:02:13.800> so<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.010> lose

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
that you don't have a red dot so I lose

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.190 
that you don't have a red dot so I lose
a<00:02:14.370> lot<00:02:14.730> of<00:02:14.760> accuracy<00:02:15.180> like<00:02:15.599> when<00:02:15.720> I<00:02:15.780> have<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.959> red

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
a lot of accuracy like when I have a red

when<00:03:15.840> you're<00:03:15.959> using<00:03:16.110> a<00:03:16.260> gun<00:03:16.440> like<00:03:16.620> the<00:03:16.739> m16

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
when you're using a gun like the m16

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.120 
when you're using a gun like the m16
especially<00:03:18.090> look<00:03:19.019> at<00:03:19.080> that<00:03:19.200> quad<00:03:19.410> feed<00:03:19.650> when

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
especially look at that quad feed when

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.920 
especially look at that quad feed when
usually<00:03:20.280> gun<00:03:20.550> like<00:03:20.700> the<00:03:20.790> m16<00:03:21.239> especially<00:03:21.720> you

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
usually gun like the m16 especially you

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:23.720 
usually gun like the m16 especially you
don't<00:03:22.140> want<00:03:22.470> the<00:03:22.590> spawn<00:03:22.830> slipping<00:03:23.310> very<00:03:23.489> much

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
don't want the spawn slipping very much

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.509 
don't want the spawn slipping very much
I<00:03:23.970> mean<00:03:24.269> the<00:03:24.540> gun<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.870> not<00:03:25.080> good<00:03:25.470> when<00:03:25.739> you<00:03:26.370> have

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 
I mean the gun is not good when you have

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:28.490 
I mean the gun is not good when you have
to<00:03:26.670> mix<00:03:26.850> you<00:03:27.330> know<00:03:27.420> split-second<00:03:28.019> decisions

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
to mix you know split-second decisions

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.900

and<00:04:05.850> that<00:04:06.150> way<00:04:06.299> they<00:04:06.540> they<00:04:06.840> spawn<00:04:07.170> inside<00:04:07.799> the

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:07.890 
and that way they they spawn inside the

building<00:04:08.220> well<00:04:08.340> there's<00:04:08.459> only<00:04:08.519> two<00:04:08.670> openings

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.150

building well there's only two openings
but<00:04:09.269> actually<00:04:09.660> sometimes<00:04:10.320> I<00:04:10.620> do<00:04:10.680> like<00:04:11.010> when

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
but actually sometimes I do like when

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.560 
but actually sometimes I do like when
they<00:04:11.280> spawn<00:04:11.489> a<00:04:11.670> because<00:04:12.000> they<00:04:12.090> spawn<00:04:12.329> in<00:04:12.390> this

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
they spawn a because they spawn in this

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.420 
they spawn a because they spawn in this
dome<00:04:12.840> area<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.380> it's<00:04:13.500> really<00:04:13.890> hard<00:04:14.160> it's

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
dome area and it's really hard it's

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.710 
dome area and it's really hard it's
really<00:04:14.519> hard<00:04:14.700> for<00:04:15.000> them<00:04:15.120> to<00:04:15.269> kill<00:04:15.450> you<00:04:15.600> because

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
really hard for them to kill you because

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.719 
really hard for them to kill you because
they<00:04:15.959> have<00:04:16.140> low<00:04:16.380> ground<00:04:16.709> and<00:04:16.979> you<00:04:17.370> have<00:04:17.519> high

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:17.729 
they have low ground and you have high

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:19.250 
they have low ground and you have high
ground<00:04:18.000> advantage<00:04:18.090> like<00:04:18.660> this<00:04:18.810> right<00:04:19.019> here<00:04:19.200> I

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
ground advantage like this right here I

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.960 
ground advantage like this right here I
mean<00:04:19.530> they<00:04:20.039> have<00:04:20.190> to<00:04:20.310> actually<00:04:20.430> shoot<00:04:20.760> up

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
mean they have to actually shoot up

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.250 
mean they have to actually shoot up
towards<00:04:21.390> you<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.660> can<00:04:21.780> just<00:04:21.930> shoot<00:04:22.079> down

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
towards you and you can just shoot down

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.990 
towards you and you can just shoot down
on<00:04:22.440> top<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.650> them<00:04:22.830> but<00:04:22.979> anyways<00:04:23.310> hope<00:04:23.729> you<00:04:23.850> guys
