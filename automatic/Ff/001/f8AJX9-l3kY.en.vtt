one<00:02:04.630> other<00:02:04.750> thing<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.230> want<00:02:05.470> to<00:02:05.530> note<00:02:05.740> also

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
one other thing to I want to note also

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.740 
one other thing to I want to note also
the<00:02:07.180> transmission<00:02:07.930> got<00:02:08.229> a<00:02:08.290> slight<00:02:08.680> slip<00:02:09.220> in<00:02:09.460> it

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
the transmission got a slight slip in it

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.120 
the transmission got a slight slip in it
like<00:02:10.750> in<00:02:10.960> second<00:02:11.440> gear<00:02:11.620> so<00:02:11.890> when<00:02:12.010> you're

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
like in second gear so when you're

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.800 
like in second gear so when you're
pulling<00:02:12.310> off<00:02:12.580> that<00:02:12.640> say<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.180> traffic<00:02:13.600> light<00:02:13.720> and

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
pulling off that say a traffic light and

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.840 
pulling off that say a traffic light and
you<00:02:13.900> kind<00:02:14.110> of<00:02:14.200> step<00:02:14.440> on<00:02:14.650> a<00:02:14.680> little<00:02:14.950> bit<00:02:15.100> first

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
you kind of step on a little bit first

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.460 
you kind of step on a little bit first
gear<00:02:16.090> it's<00:02:16.240> fine<00:02:16.450> then<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.960> seconds<00:02:17.320> got

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
gear it's fine then you the seconds got

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.040 
gear it's fine then you the seconds got
like<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.680> little<00:02:17.920> lag<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:19.210> it<00:02:19.540> takes<00:02:19.750> about<00:02:19.900> a

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
like a little lag and it takes about a

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:21.720 
like a little lag and it takes about a
second<00:02:20.470> or<00:02:20.530> two<00:02:20.710> it<00:02:20.740> needs<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.130> catch<00:02:21.370> up<00:02:21.400> and

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
second or two it needs to catch up and

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.060 
second or two it needs to catch up and
then<00:02:21.790> there<00:02:22.000> to<00:02:22.090> go<00:02:22.270> but<00:02:22.930> once<00:02:23.260> you<00:02:23.470> get<00:02:23.680> say

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
then there to go but once you get say

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.670 
then there to go but once you get say
like<00:02:24.280> up<00:02:24.490> to<00:02:24.640> say<00:02:25.120> 60<00:02:25.480> miles<00:02:25.660> an<00:02:25.810> hour<00:02:25.930> rpm<00:02:26.350> tend

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
like up to say 60 miles an hour rpm tend

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.070 
like up to say 60 miles an hour rpm tend
to<00:02:26.740> run<00:02:26.890> a<00:02:26.920> little<00:02:27.040> bit<00:02:27.160> high<00:02:27.400> for<00:02:28.120> some<00:02:28.660> reason

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
to run a little bit high for some reason

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.620 
to run a little bit high for some reason
at<00:02:29.260> about<00:02:29.530> 60<00:02:29.980> you<00:02:30.160> are<00:02:30.340> right<00:02:30.820> at<00:02:31.000> a<00:02:31.300> little

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
at about 60 you are right at a little

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.960 
at about 60 you are right at a little
old<00:02:31.720> 4000<00:02:32.410> rpm<00:02:32.860> 65<00:02:33.460> miles<00:02:33.850> an<00:02:34.060> hour<00:02:34.180> you<00:02:34.480> about

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
old 4000 rpm 65 miles an hour you about

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.780 
old 4000 rpm 65 miles an hour you about
4,500<00:02:37.080> rpms<00:02:38.080> and<00:02:38.230> you<00:02:38.470> cruising<00:02:38.890> at<00:02:38.980> about<00:02:39.160> 70

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
4,500 rpms and you cruising at about 70

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.110 
4,500 rpms and you cruising at about 70
you<00:02:40.330> right<00:02:40.810> at<00:02:40.990> about<00:02:41.260> maybe<00:02:41.620> 48<00:02:42.490> you<00:02:43.000> know<00:02:43.090> a

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
you right at about maybe 48 you know a

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.600 
you right at about maybe 48 you know a
thousand<00:02:43.660> rpm<00:02:44.080> so<00:02:44.290> I<00:02:44.560> think<00:02:44.860> maybe<00:02:45.400> you<00:02:45.580> might

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
thousand rpm so I think maybe you might

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.420 
thousand rpm so I think maybe you might
have<00:02:45.790> to<00:02:46.150> synchronize<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.990> transmission<00:02:47.770> or

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
have to synchronize the transmission or

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:51.300 
have to synchronize the transmission or
the<00:02:48.820> RPMs<00:02:49.420> with<00:02:49.600> the<00:02:49.690> axle<00:02:50.110> or<00:02:50.200> whatever<00:02:50.560> but

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
the RPMs with the axle or whatever but

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.760 
the RPMs with the axle or whatever but
the<00:02:51.850> transit<00:02:52.240> does<00:02:52.420> shift<00:02:52.750> out<00:02:52.959> okay<00:02:53.410> but<00:02:53.680> it

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
the transit does shift out okay but it

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.710 
the transit does shift out okay but it
does<00:02:53.920> have<00:02:54.130> that<00:02:54.310> slight<00:02:54.580> slip<00:02:55.000> in<00:02:55.209> second

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
does have that slight slip in second

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.780 
does have that slight slip in second
gear<00:02:56.250> what<00:02:57.250> I'm<00:02:57.340> gonna<00:02:57.430> do<00:02:57.520> I'm<00:02:57.640> gonna<00:02:57.700> go

you before we run out of time there you
go<00:03:59.950> sounds<00:04:00.950> good<00:04:01.840> okay<00:04:02.840> this<00:04:03.020> is<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.290> way<00:04:03.440> I

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
go sounds good okay this is the way I

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:17.440 
go sounds good okay this is the way I
picked<00:04:03.830> up<00:04:03.920> about<00:04:15.340> those<00:04:16.340> steam<00:04:17.000> cleaners
