let them do the gay so so it would be a
lot<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.050> extra<00:00:52.469> work<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.920> get<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> gazel

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that's in the open slot because I

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.369 
that's in the open slot because I
decided<00:01:01.770> I'm<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> use<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.719> primer

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379

spray using a primer spray works really

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.649 
spray using a primer spray works really
well<00:01:07.290> because<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.070> phone<00:01:08.460> doesn't<00:01:08.850> get<00:01:09.600> a

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
well because the phone doesn't get a

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.719 
well because the phone doesn't get a
chance<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.990> really<00:01:10.140> soak<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.830> and<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.549> gives

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
chance to really soak it up and it gives

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.940 
chance to really soak it up and it gives
you<00:01:11.820> a<00:01:11.850> nice<00:01:12.060> surface<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.479> paint<00:01:12.840> on<00:01:12.990> however<00:01:13.619> I

the<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.820> the<00:01:48.060> next<00:01:48.450> picture<00:01:49.159> again<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.670> white

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
the in the next picture again the white

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.550 
the in the next picture again the white
primer<00:01:51.630> would<00:01:51.869> have<00:01:51.960> been<00:01:52.049> better<00:01:52.259> because<00:01:52.409> I

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
primer would have been better because I

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.200 
primer would have been better because I
wanted<00:01:52.860> these<00:01:52.950> colors<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.399> really<00:01:53.670> pop<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:53.939> I

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
wanted these colors to really pop so I

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.450 
wanted these colors to really pop so I
ended<00:01:54.689> up<00:01:54.750> having<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.170> use<00:01:55.200> a<00:01:55.649> lot<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.250> extra

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
ended up having to use a lot of extra

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.609 
ended up having to use a lot of extra
paint<00:01:56.969> in<00:01:57.210> order<00:01:57.360> to<00:01:57.600> make<00:01:57.750> the<00:01:57.899> colors<00:01:58.259> much

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
paint in order to make the colors much

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.679 
paint in order to make the colors much
brighter<00:01:58.950> it's<00:01:59.790> best<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.119> take<00:02:00.329> your<00:02:00.509> time

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
brighter it's best to take your time

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.240 
brighter it's best to take your time
when<00:02:00.899> you're<00:02:01.020> actually<00:02:01.229> doing<00:02:01.439> the<00:02:01.799> painting

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
when you're actually doing the painting

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.950 
when you're actually doing the painting
part<00:02:02.520> because<00:02:02.759> if<00:02:02.880> you<00:02:02.969> rush<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.810> end

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
part because if you rush it you can end

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.230 
part because if you rush it you can end
up<00:02:04.079> ruining<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:05.159> hard<00:02:05.460> work<00:02:05.670> that<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.060> did

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
up ruining the hard work that you did

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
up ruining the hard work that you did
you<00:02:07.079> want<00:02:07.229> to<00:02:07.290> make<00:02:07.409> sure<00:02:07.439> you<00:02:07.860> do<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.160> primer

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
you want to make sure you do the primer

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.249 
you want to make sure you do the primer
at<00:02:08.700> various<00:02:09.209> angles<00:02:09.450> to<00:02:09.780> get<00:02:09.899> into<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
at various angles to get into the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.930 
at various angles to get into the
different<00:02:10.379> crevices<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.129> cracks<00:02:11.430> this<00:02:11.760> is

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
different crevices and cracks this is

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.150 
different crevices and cracks this is
why<00:02:12.090> it's<00:02:12.270> good<00:02:12.480> to<00:02:12.510> do<00:02:12.840> light<00:02:13.620> coats<00:02:13.920> because

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
why it's good to do light coats because

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.330 
why it's good to do light coats because
if

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
if

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.400 
if

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
you do a heavy coat it's going to drip

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.170 
you do a heavy coat it's going to drip
everywhere<00:02:16.590> it's<00:02:17.250> going<00:02:17.430> to<00:02:17.489> clog<00:02:17.730> up<00:02:17.910> stuff

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
everywhere it's going to clog up stuff

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.720 
everywhere it's going to clog up stuff
and<00:02:18.480> you<00:02:18.599> can<00:02:18.780> even<00:02:19.019> lose<00:02:19.170> the<00:02:19.410> detail<00:02:19.730> that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
and you can even lose the detail that

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.759 
and you can even lose the detail that
you<00:02:20.849> have<00:02:20.879> on<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.390> sword<00:02:21.660> now<00:02:22.319> if<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.560> wanted

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
you have on the sword now if you wanted

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.210 
you have on the sword now if you wanted
to<00:02:22.860> use<00:02:23.040> other<00:02:23.310> spray<00:02:24.180> paint<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:25.110> use<00:02:25.950> the

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
to use other spray paint to use the

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.490 
to use other spray paint to use the
color<00:02:26.670> your<00:02:26.849> items<00:02:27.690> then<00:02:27.870> you<00:02:28.019> can<00:02:28.170> use<00:02:28.290> that

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
color your items then you can use that

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.039 
color your items then you can use that
you<00:02:29.160> know<00:02:29.250> it's<00:02:29.670> not<00:02:29.849> that<00:02:30.090> hard<00:02:30.360> and<00:02:30.660> some<00:02:30.930> of

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
you know it's not that hard and some of

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:32.089 
you know it's not that hard and some of
the<00:02:31.110> spray<00:02:31.319> paint<00:02:31.500> actually<00:02:31.920> has<00:02:32.069> a

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
the spray paint actually has a

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.130 
the spray paint actually has a
self-leveling

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
self-leveling

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.449 
self-leveling
attribute<00:02:34.140> to<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.410> so<00:02:34.590> that<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.860> get<00:02:35.099> a<00:02:35.160> much

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
attribute to it so that you get a much

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.339 
attribute to it so that you get a much
nicer<00:02:35.700> smoother<00:02:36.360> surface<00:02:36.750> but<00:02:36.989> you<00:02:37.140> got<00:02:37.260> to

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
nicer smoother surface but you got to

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:39.740 
nicer smoother surface but you got to
remember<00:02:37.530> your<00:02:38.519> item<00:02:38.849> needs<00:02:39.000> be<00:02:39.150> laying<00:02:39.360> flat

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
remember your item needs be laying flat

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:41.330 
remember your item needs be laying flat
in<00:02:39.989> order<00:02:40.230> for<00:02:40.379> that<00:02:40.470> smooth<00:02:40.709> surface<00:02:41.129> to

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
in order for that smooth surface to

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.610 
in order for that smooth surface to
really<00:02:41.970> look<00:02:42.360> good<00:02:42.569> one<00:02:43.049> of<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.230> things<00:02:43.440> that

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
really look good one of the things that

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.080 
really look good one of the things that
was<00:02:43.739> really<00:02:43.920> hard<00:02:44.190> about<00:02:44.400> prepping<00:02:44.790> for<00:02:44.940> this

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
was really hard about prepping for this

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.690 
was really hard about prepping for this
bright<00:02:45.360> paint<00:02:45.599> was<00:02:46.200> covering<00:02:46.590> the<00:02:46.709> gems<00:02:46.980> the

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
bright paint was covering the gems the

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.430 
bright paint was covering the gems the
the<00:02:48.120> tape<00:02:48.299> really<00:02:48.630> didn't<00:02:49.019> want<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.230> stick<00:02:49.380> to

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
the tape really didn't want to stick to

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:50.690 
the tape really didn't want to stick to
the<00:02:49.530> gems<00:02:49.799> I<00:02:49.920> didn't<00:02:50.220> really<00:02:50.370> have<00:02:50.459> anything

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
the gems I didn't really have anything

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.270 
the gems I didn't really have anything
else<00:02:50.910> to<00:02:51.120> put<00:02:51.450> on<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.870> gems<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.230> cover<00:02:52.950> them<00:02:53.160> up

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
else to put on the gems to cover them up

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.839 
else to put on the gems to cover them up
and<00:02:53.519> make<00:02:53.790> them<00:02:54.049> stay<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:56.010> it<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.489> took<00:02:56.610> time

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
and make them stay so it just took time

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.970 
and make them stay so it just took time
doing<00:02:57.390> a<00:02:57.660> tape<00:02:57.989> over<00:02:58.230> and<00:02:58.530> over<00:02:58.739> and<00:02:58.799> over

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
doing a tape over and over and over

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.410 
doing a tape over and over and over
again<00:02:59.069> until<00:02:59.220> we<00:02:59.400> finally<00:02:59.730> got<00:02:59.819> them<00:03:00.030> covered

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
again until we finally got them covered

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.360 
again until we finally got them covered
so<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:00.989> can<00:03:01.110> see<00:03:01.319> here<00:03:01.620> I've<00:03:01.890> got<00:03:02.099> them<00:03:02.250> all

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
and as you see here spraying it I'm just

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.400 
and as you see here spraying it I'm just
doing<00:03:58.410> passes<00:03:58.980> back<00:03:59.160> and<00:03:59.430> forth<00:03:59.900> one<00:04:00.900> side<00:04:01.139> and

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
doing passes back and forth one side and

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:02.870 
doing passes back and forth one side and
I'll<00:04:01.590> flip<00:04:01.799> it<00:04:01.829> and<00:04:02.040> do<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.280> on<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.519> other<00:04:02.549> side

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880

and<00:04:03.239> you<00:04:03.389> know<00:04:03.510> you'd<00:04:03.780> be<00:04:03.959> careful<00:04:04.319> you<00:04:04.440> will

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
and you know you'd be careful you will

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.129 
and you know you'd be careful you will
get<00:04:04.739> paint<00:04:04.980> on<00:04:05.130> yourself<00:04:05.549> it's<00:04:05.760> it's<00:04:06.750> hard<00:04:06.989> to

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
get paint on yourself it's it's hard to

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.170 
get paint on yourself it's it's hard to
avoid<00:04:07.290> that<00:04:07.680> the<00:04:08.609> thing<00:04:08.819> that<00:04:09.000> was<00:04:09.150> really

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
avoid that the thing that was really

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.970 
avoid that the thing that was really
nice<00:04:09.599> is<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:10.049> with<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.380> amount<00:04:10.799> of<00:04:10.829> spray

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
nice is that with the amount of spray

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.800 
nice is that with the amount of spray
paint<00:04:11.040> I<00:04:11.280> was<00:04:11.400> able<00:04:11.549> to<00:04:11.700> put<00:04:12.030> on<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.359> edge<00:04:12.510> here

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:12.810 
paint I was able to put on the edge here

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.909 
paint I was able to put on the edge here
I<00:04:12.959> really<00:04:13.829> got<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.040> nice<00:04:14.400> smooth<00:04:15.269> edge<00:04:15.930> on<00:04:16.769> the

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
I really got a nice smooth edge on the

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.599 
I really got a nice smooth edge on the
blade<00:04:17.479> it<00:04:18.479> didn't<00:04:19.289> have<00:04:19.620> any<00:04:19.829> of<00:04:19.979> the<00:04:20.099> defects

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
blade it didn't have any of the defects

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.279 
blade it didn't have any of the defects
or<00:04:20.820> divots<00:04:21.239> or<00:04:21.419> you<00:04:21.539> can<00:04:21.690> really<00:04:21.900> notice<00:04:22.049> the

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
or divots or you can really notice the

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.930 
or divots or you can really notice the
divots<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.770> stuff<00:04:22.950> and<00:04:23.190> the<00:04:23.520> texture<00:04:23.909> was

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
divots and stuff and the texture was

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.870 
divots and stuff and the texture was
nice<00:04:24.270> and<00:04:24.570> smooth<00:04:25.219> unlike<00:04:26.219> the<00:04:26.400> other<00:04:26.550> parts

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
nice and smooth unlike the other parts

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:27.340 
nice and smooth unlike the other parts
of<00:04:26.969> the<00:04:27.090> store

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
of the store

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.860 
of the store
where<00:04:27.530> it's<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.770> more<00:04:28.160> textured<00:04:28.520> in<00:04:28.760> rough<00:04:29.090> like

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
where it's a more textured in rough like

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:33.610 
where it's a more textured in rough like
a<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.770> it's<00:04:31.550> an<00:04:31.730> effect<00:04:32.000> I<00:04:32.120> wanted<00:04:32.450> as<00:04:33.290> you<00:04:33.470> can

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
a and it's an effect I wanted as you can

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.620 
a and it's an effect I wanted as you can
see<00:04:33.830> here<00:04:34.130> I<00:04:34.160> started<00:04:34.610> painting<00:04:34.850> the<00:04:35.150> inside

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:35.630 
see here I started painting the inside

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.630 
see here I started painting the inside
of<00:04:35.750> the<00:04:35.840> sword<00:04:36.110> so<00:04:36.620> as<00:04:36.860> I<00:04:36.980> said<00:04:37.190> the<00:04:37.370> colors

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:37.640 
of the sword so as I said the colors

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.280 
of the sword so as I said the colors
will<00:04:37.760> come<00:04:37.910> out<00:04:38.030> darker<00:04:38.480> so<00:04:38.720> I<00:04:38.750> started<00:04:39.140> with

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
will come out darker so I started with

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.740 
will come out darker so I started with
blue<00:04:39.530> and<00:04:39.740> one<00:04:40.610> of<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:40.760> things<00:04:41.000> that<00:04:41.180> I<00:04:41.210> really

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
blue and one of the things that I really

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.690 
blue and one of the things that I really
notice<00:04:42.080> is<00:04:42.260> that<00:04:42.290> you<00:04:42.740> end<00:04:42.800> up<00:04:42.980> using<00:04:43.040> a<00:04:43.430> lot<00:04:43.460> of

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:43.700 
notice is that you end up using a lot of

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.060 
notice is that you end up using a lot of
acrylic<00:04:44.180> paint<00:04:44.420> when<00:04:44.600> hand<00:04:44.840> painting<00:04:45.290> because

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
acrylic paint when hand painting because

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.610 
acrylic paint when hand painting because
it<00:04:46.280> just<00:04:46.460> it's<00:04:46.820> harder<00:04:47.240> to<00:04:47.390> paint<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:48.410> then<00:04:48.560> I

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
it just it's harder to paint and then I

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.490 
it just it's harder to paint and then I
use<00:04:48.770> the<00:04:48.920> lighter<00:04:49.130> blue<00:04:49.340> on<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:49.610> inside<00:04:49.640> and

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
use the lighter blue on the inside and

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.020 
use the lighter blue on the inside and
really<00:04:51.500> it's<00:04:51.770> probably<00:04:52.220> better<00:04:52.370> to<00:04:52.460> water<00:04:52.820> it

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
really it's probably better to water it

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.660 
really it's probably better to water it
down<00:04:53.560> will<00:04:54.560> help<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.920> acrylic<00:04:55.280> lasting

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:55.670 
down will help the acrylic lasting

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:57.280 
down will help the acrylic lasting
longer<00:04:55.880> and<00:04:56.240> you<00:04:56.600> can<00:04:56.750> paint<00:04:56.900> it<00:04:57.020> but<00:04:57.080> you<00:04:57.170> got

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
longer and you can paint it but you got

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:58.900 
longer and you can paint it but you got
