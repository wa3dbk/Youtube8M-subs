00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.559
 a year is not it - for runners 

00:00:19.339 --> 00:00:20.419
 see 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:23.449
 no monday 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.649
 1 

00:00:26.649 --> 00:00:27.720
 12 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.289
 on Monday 

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.289
 not see 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.900
 hello everyone and welcome to this video today we learn picking 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.930
 this technique will allow us to create much richer music 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.570
 is much more complex 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.010
 will leave him more rhythmic than before with them chords forget 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.260
 immediately with simultaneous players 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.270
 for to learn the techniques 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.110
 2 we will avoid tablatures 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.570
 which will complicate our life or more than anything else 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.810
 and we will rather rely on agreements 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.810
 stake play separately 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.950
 no panic over the melody or introduction actually it's just 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.520
 by the sequence of this rope a8 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.680
 play in loop 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.490
 it may seem complicated at first glance but you will see that it 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.490
 must break down it's really very very simple 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.360
 at first part of the kander more serious to knock out the 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.240
 second 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.240
 it's the fifth string 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.080
 we will always start again from the beginning the end of well memorized piece 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.690
 we then come to save the third string 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.880
 for the third step we will ring link 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.530
 no problem 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
 when we come back to the second string 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.460
 well added it is a few euros thereafter 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:19.639
 we add the third string 

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.669
 but then we come back the first step of the beginning, that is to say, we will 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:33.980
 ring the rope 2 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.980
 but in israel 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.609
 but here we went around our little melody picking 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.159
 Nebout on the ground to produce a brennan fluid game 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.849
 renault who will give us these 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:19.579
 so for chords I advise you before mastering the 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.799
 Milliyet 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.799
 the sword of the minor 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:32.080
 so here it's really simple we're just going to implement the agreements 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.269
 the little swimming melody we made just 

00:03:39.779 --> 00:03:43.899
 and there as if by magic applying the back we will sponsor the say rather 

00:03:43.899 --> 00:03:46.899
 nice laurels 

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:55.769
 then we will apply times to what we learned from the previous mans 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.699
 and then we're going to be born on laminaria 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.319
 we get 7 melodist 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.800
 the hardest here is to synchronize perfectly between the right side and 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.680
 the left part 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.680
 at each end of measures like these 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.699
 it will be necessary to change the agreement 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.430
 we can then buy other young people 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.189
 by adding posh chord variants 

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:06.189
 that is, instead of playing these 

00:05:08.559 --> 00:05:10.699
 1 5 

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:11.680
 1 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.680
 reims marne it takes two variants are given 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:22.439
 we love and motivate us 

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:25.439
 the 2010 invasion much more ambitious than the previous 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:28.870
 even 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.319
 m 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.319
 the 

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:46.699
 a mother 

00:05:46.699 --> 00:05:49.229
 but 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.229
 the nba 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.789
 no
