try to discover where the correct

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.770 
try to discover where the correct
directory<00:01:05.350> is<00:01:05.619> for<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.920> registry<00:01:06.399> entries<00:01:06.820> it

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
directory is for the registry entries it

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.540 
directory is for the registry entries it
will<00:01:07.930> give<00:01:08.140> you<00:01:08.320> what<00:01:08.530> it<00:01:08.680> thinks<00:01:08.890> it<00:01:09.100> is<00:01:09.220> if

you don't know for sure it's different

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.200 
you don't know for sure it's different
just<00:01:13.810> leave<00:01:14.050> the<00:01:14.610> configuration<00:01:15.610> as<00:01:15.759> is<00:01:15.970> and

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
just leave the configuration as is and

just leave the configuration as is and
hit<00:01:16.360> enter<00:01:22.170> next<00:01:23.170> thing<00:01:23.259> that's<00:01:23.320> going<00:01:23.440> to<00:01:23.590> do

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
hit enter next thing that's going to do

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.200 
hit enter next thing that's going to do
is<00:01:23.860> you're<00:01:23.979> going<00:01:24.130> to<00:01:24.190> figure<00:01:24.700> out<00:01:24.910> if<00:01:25.060> you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
is you're going to figure out if you

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.120 
is you're going to figure out if you
want<00:01:25.360> to<00:01:25.420> do<00:01:25.539> a<00:01:25.570> password<00:01:26.110> reset<00:01:26.140> or<00:01:26.770> go<00:01:26.920> into

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
want to do a password reset or go into

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.580 
want to do a password reset or go into
the<00:01:27.220> recovery<00:01:27.520> console<00:01:28.210> to<00:01:28.810> do<00:01:28.929> some<00:01:29.140> software

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:29.590 
the recovery console to do some software

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.160 
the recovery console to do some software
changes<00:01:29.979> on<00:01:30.160> parameters<00:01:30.700> in<00:01:31.450> this<00:01:31.660> case<00:01:31.899> we're

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
changes on parameters in this case we're

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.539 
changes on parameters in this case we're
just<00:01:32.439> going<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.590> do<00:01:32.680> the<00:01:32.770> password<00:01:33.159> reset

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
just going to do the password reset

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:43.360 
just going to do the password reset
which<00:01:33.790> works<00:01:34.030> with<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.360> same

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:43.370 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.860 

so<00:01:44.370> it's<00:01:44.490> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> load<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.000> Sam<00:01:45.240> system

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:45.870 
so it's going to load the Sam system

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.750 
so it's going to load the Sam system
security<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:47.010> it's<00:01:47.190> going<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.370> ask<00:01:47.460> you

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.460 
security and now it's going to ask you
if<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.970> want<00:01:48.180> again<00:01:48.390> use<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.960> registry

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
if you want again use the registry

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.310 
if you want again use the registry
editor<00:01:49.830> on<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.610> or<00:01:50.790> if<00:01:50.940> you<00:01:51.090> just<00:01:51.120> want<00:01:51.660> to<00:01:51.720> do

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
editor on it or if you just want to do

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.950 
editor on it or if you just want to do
user<00:01:52.920> data<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.430> passwords<00:01:53.940> in<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.510> case<00:01:54.720> I

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
user data and passwords in this case I

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.840 
user data and passwords in this case I
just<00:01:55.020> want<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.530> do<00:01:55.710> user<00:01:56.010> data<00:01:56.310> and<00:01:56.460> password

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
just want to do user data and password

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:04.720 
just want to do user data and password
so<00:01:56.880> I'll<00:01:57.150> select<00:01:57.300> one<00:01:57.720> and<00:01:57.930> hit<00:01:58.260> enter

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.820 

so<00:02:05.390> now<00:02:05.510> let's<00:02:05.660> see<00:02:05.780> a<00:02:05.810> list<00:02:06.050> of<00:02:06.170> users<00:02:06.500> on<00:02:06.680> this

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830 
so now let's see a list of users on this

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.670 
so now let's see a list of users on this
box<00:02:07.390> there's<00:02:08.390> administrator<00:02:09.020> guest<00:02:09.380> home

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:09.680 
box there's administrator guest home

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.130 
box there's administrator guest home

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
to work well it works sometimes

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.770
