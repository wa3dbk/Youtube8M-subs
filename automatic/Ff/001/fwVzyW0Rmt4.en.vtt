00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.799
 welcome friends from androidworld.it today 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:13.530
 we are here to show you hoover hoover 

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:15.509
 that the new version of halo a new one 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.240
 different version from the previous one 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:21.660
 not only for the name of course but also 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.700
 and above all for the features 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.410
 it is always a matter of managing notifications 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.820
 that come to our smartphone in 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.649
 so that they are always visible in 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.590
 overlay over the rest of the 

00:00:28.649 --> 00:00:32.850
 content but compared to halo paranoid 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.850
 android has changed completely 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.230
 the approach to verify there 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.120
 I show that we are precisely with 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.940
 the latest version of android paranoid is 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.960
 released tonight 4.3 beta 1 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.660
 based on android 4.4.2 how it works 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.670
 so hoover we have to go into the 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.010
 notifications panel is this here is 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.230
 the button to activate hoover the fact 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.570
 that the functionality is activated is indicated 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.570
 precisely from this bar that is colored and 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.460
 so instead it is deactivated note that the 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.500
 Hoover button is present only in the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.659
 notifications panel and not in that 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.800
 so we go to the quick settings 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.510
 enable hoover 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.850
 we remain here in our home 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.550
 screen and using another smartphone 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.200
 let's send us for example to a hangouts in 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.780
 this case you see that if we don't do 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.180
 nothing comes the notification of the layout after 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.920
 little disappears and we find it here 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.530
 exactly in the midst of all the others 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.240
 notifications in this way if also 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.070
 we have applications for example a 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.750
 all running screen we'll see 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.970
 however the presence of a notification e 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.820
 then we will decide whether to exploit it 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.619
 or less what happens if we try instead to 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.680
 interact with the notification we can 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.930
 drag down you see it 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.110
 in this case it was not expandable though 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.000
 but instead we click on it 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.640
 we find that we can access in 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.900
 this floating window 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.880
 to the application that generated precisely 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.520
 this notifies in this case hangouts 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.810
 this was some we say 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.090
 trial notifications as you will have 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.700
 understood not always did what 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:08.149
 they had to but the app now 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.149
 it works and is perfectly usable 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:18.599
 if we answer, I too have the greeting 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.549
 and from here on our wico the eu from here 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.160
 We sent messages has arrived 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.599
 answer promptly this is one 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.220
 window that as you see in 

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.799
 overlay with respect to the rest of the 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:31.049
 content you can't move it you see 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.780
 even if I press there is no drag 

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:36.480
 it's hangouts in every way 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.579
 you can go just to see the 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.079
 classic hangout options that 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:41.989
 you would have the normal screen 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.579
 application by pressing the key 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:46.650
 simply exit the app in 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:49.260
 running at that time so much for 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.870
 check how things work with 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.269
 a full screen application starts 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.660
 angry birds hoping it 's a 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:03:02.220
 lucky charm for oak that maybe 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.620
 you will have read must also with angry birds 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.980
 in the background we go a little bit 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.079
 we have the possibility to silence it 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.540
 answer in this window to note 

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:14.250
 that the application in the background continues 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.160
 its execution therefore in the case of a 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.350
 game will not pause in the case of a 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.970
 browser will continue uploading yours 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.230
 arab are running into 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.540
 Contemporary 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.180
 then you will decide which one 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.880
 of the two use by clicking then on 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.800
 out of the screen 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.620
 the floating window of over yes 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.240
 just go back to the application that 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.530
 on background 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.510
 this in short with regards to 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:41.820
 hoover what a different approach indeed 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.100
 to the management of notifications and that 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.780
 however being still in beta it will go 

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.880
 finished but in any case there is a sum 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.040
 liked this idea let's say new to 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.590
 have notifications up instead of 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.360
 the bubble that was then shift around 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.000
 for the screen it seems like an experience 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.890
 a little more substantial at the moment 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.570
 it is not possible for example to scroll 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.440
 among the various notifications you can interact 

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:07.110
 only with the last one though anyway 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.910
 in short, we liked the approach quickly 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.380
 tour also some small news of 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:12.390
 latter version of words of 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.660
 android you see for example that present 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.660
 the resume and the pause for i 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:21.150
 downloads in this way very easy 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.670
 applies to any type of download that 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:25.890
 either from the play store or out early 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.200
 same you can pause it and 

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.850
 however re-starting them there are also some 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.330
 more options for example for the 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:36.120
 multitasking button the first time 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.090
 we press it we are asked if we want 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.250
 that the button to access the point le 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.650
 Recent apps also serve to empty them 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.800
 the list you see becomes with this form 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.200
 and we can just empty the list 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.580
 of the recent apps in this way the 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.530
 second time we press it 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:55.140
 for example for a long time we have the option of 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.880
 quick lunch, that is, holding down a 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.880
 along the multitasking button will come 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.730
 launched the previous application 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.860
 let 's say present and yes let's take it 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.360
 long and you see that the 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:08.190
 play store 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.470
 if the first stretch we return to the 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.270
 toys back home screen 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:19.140
 same cesino was quite an easy one 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:22.440
 ok let's go for example in the calendar 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.040
 we return to the home and return to the 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.050
 calendar 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.940
 in short, as you can see, it is quite easy 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.480
 switch from one app to another in this one 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.790
 way 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.160
 if you are already 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.380
 in a move application 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.420
 another example in this one 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.610
 way 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:42.960
 see that you return to the application 

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:45.450
 previous therefore if you are used to do 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.190
 maybe a switch and quick more 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:50.100
 this is multitasking applications 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:51.360
 certainly a very useful function 

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:53.490
 then we have small changes 

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.130
 also on paranoid ota I must be 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.450
 I don't really remember exactly how 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.800
 it was the interface of before however a 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.210
 defense of the cause of paranoid android e 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.070
 I say that this interface of comparison 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:08.280
 I like the division into tabs 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.380
 very functional year settings 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:12.800
 this photo maybe a little thin but 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.800
 in short, in every excuse anyway 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:19.860
 the application turns out to be sorry 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:22.470
 functional with regard to the novelties 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:26.190
 precisely of this last update of 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:28.590
 paranoid android I repeat 4.3 beta 1 the 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.360
 our short tour ends here 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.480
 as for hoover and the 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:34.590
 its development is just beginning 

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:36.180
 we will see in the coming weeks if 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:37.920
 other features will be added 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.930
 however for the moment it seemed to us 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.540
 all in all rather stable and 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:44.160
 reliable i 'll show you that it works 

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:46.470
 also with any type of notification for 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.750
 example the screenshot that in this case 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.070
 is an expandable notification and you see that 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.870
 we have the classic options for 

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:54.030
 share or cancel 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.730
 if we do nothing after a while 

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:58.560
 notification will disappear by itself the last 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.270
 what I wanted to show you I go out for a moment 

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.730
 of room to mask the address 

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:05.100
 email is the fact that here in the entry 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:08.700
 backup and restore you will have the 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:10.230
 possibility to reset preferences 

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:12.870
 presenting preferences means that 

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:15.540
 for example if we have decided to 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:16.980
 attribute to the multitasking button the 

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.770
 function to switch between apps 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.000
 here we could present it and ditto the fans 

00:07:19.770 --> 00:07:22.830
 if we have decided to attribute to 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.100
 multitasking function to cancel 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:28.610
 all the apps here we can reset it 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:30.289
 same thing applies for example 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:32.810
 we interacted with the sidebar 

00:07:30.289 --> 00:07:34.490
 in this case if we want the edge 

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.949
 side of the status bar show le 

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.139
 quick settings the reset option 

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:40.430
 will always appear in the entry backup e 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:42.229
 restoration to this is a small one 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.780
 advice that maybe not all yet 

00:07:42.229 --> 00:07:46.520
 they know it is true even in the 

00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:48.830
 previous versions of words from android 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.129
 for this our hoover test then 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:54.129
 it's all a nicola ii gas salute for 

00:07:51.129 --> 00:07:54.129
