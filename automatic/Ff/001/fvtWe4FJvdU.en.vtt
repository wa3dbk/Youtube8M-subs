always want to have a thermometer

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.630 
always want to have a thermometer
I<00:00:24.330> recommend<00:00:24.960> the<00:00:25.050> digital<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:25.830> since<00:00:26.340> my

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
I recommend the digital but since my

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.340 
I recommend the digital but since my
eggs<00:00:26.820> haven't<00:00:27.150> come<00:00:27.300> yet<00:00:27.330> as<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.869> can<00:00:27.990> see<00:00:28.170> I

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:28.350 
eggs haven't come yet as you can see I

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.740 
eggs haven't come yet as you can see I
just<00:00:29.280> use<00:00:29.430> this<00:00:29.580> one<00:00:29.790> just<00:00:30.090> to<00:00:30.210> regulate<00:00:30.570> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
just use this one just to regulate the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.930 
just use this one just to regulate the
temp<00:00:31.020> I<00:00:31.290> would<00:00:32.070> recommend<00:00:32.550> getting<00:00:32.880> your

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
temp I would recommend getting your

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.000 
temp I would recommend getting your
incubator<00:00:33.420> started<00:00:33.870> before<00:00:34.020> your<00:00:34.739> snake

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
incubator started before your snake

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.720 
incubator started before your snake
laser<00:00:35.220> your<00:00:35.640> eggs<00:00:35.820> so<00:00:36.950> just<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:38.070> get<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.340> temp

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
laser your eggs so just to get the temp

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.350 
laser your eggs so just to get the temp
regulated<00:00:39.330> and<00:00:39.570> get<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.110> all<00:00:40.230> set<00:00:40.470> up<00:00:40.500> okay<00:00:41.370> so

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
regulated and get it all set up okay so

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.990

this is my pro light you can get it at
your<00:00:45.030> garden<00:00:45.300> store<00:00:45.750> looks<00:00:46.500> pretty<00:00:46.770> good<00:00:47.010> I'll

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
make sure it has no fertilizer because

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.860 
make sure it has no fertilizer because
that<00:00:53.460> will<00:00:53.580> suffocate<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.089> eggs<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.540> you<00:00:54.600> want

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
that will suffocate the eggs so you want

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.560 
that will suffocate the eggs so you want
to<00:00:54.930> make<00:00:55.050> sure<00:00:55.080> no<00:00:55.650> fertilizer<00:00:56.339> and<00:00:56.699> this

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
to make sure no fertilizer and this

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.360 
to make sure no fertilizer and this
stuff<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.960> actually<00:00:58.199> very<00:00:58.530> sticky<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.250> don't

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
stuff is actually very sticky so I don't

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.110 
stuff is actually very sticky so I don't
want<00:00:59.519> to<00:00:59.580> touch<00:00:59.850> it

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
want to touch it

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.439 
want to touch it
but<00:01:00.780> um<00:01:01.019> for<00:01:01.440> corn<00:01:02.040> bags<00:01:02.309> the<00:01:03.030> main<00:01:03.210> goal

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
but um for corn bags the main goal

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.660 
but um for corn bags the main goal
pretty<00:01:03.720> much<00:01:03.900> is<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.290> maintain<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.979> humidity<00:01:05.460> of

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
pretty much is to maintain a humidity of

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.060 
pretty much is to maintain a humidity of
100<00:01:06.180> degrees<00:01:06.620> so<00:01:08.750> do<00:01:09.750> this<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.320> want<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.860> soak

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
100 degrees so do this you want to soak

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.480 
100 degrees so do this you want to soak
your<00:01:11.100> vermi<00:01:11.490> your<00:01:12.150> perlite<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.810> make<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.680> a

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
your vermi your perlite and make and a

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.390 
your vermi your perlite and make and a
trick<00:01:14.760> that<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.060> use<00:01:15.330> is<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:16.050> put<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.500> piece<00:01:17.250> of

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
trick that I use is you put a piece of

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.100 
trick that I use is you put a piece of
paper<00:01:17.580> towel<00:01:17.850> or<00:01:18.120> a<00:01:18.180> newspaper<00:01:19.100> on<00:01:20.100> top<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:21.110> as

paper towel or a newspaper on top and as
you<00:01:22.700> integrate<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> eggs<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.960> stuff<00:01:25.470> will

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
you integrate the eggs your stuff will

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.770 
you integrate the eggs your stuff will
turn<00:01:26.010> your<00:01:26.490> paper<00:01:26.910> towel<00:01:27.210> will<00:01:27.480> let<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:27.720> know

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
or let it sit out so right now this

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.200 
or let it sit out so right now this
paper<00:01:35.370> towel<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:36.320> moderately<00:01:37.320> wet<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:38.790> mean

paper towel is moderately wet so I mean

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.380 
paper towel is moderately wet so I mean
the<00:01:39.630> humidity<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.230> pretty<00:01:40.470> good<00:01:40.650> so<00:01:41.430> I<00:01:41.760> don't

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the humidity is pretty good so I don't

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.080 
the humidity is pretty good so I don't
need<00:01:42.510> to<00:01:42.570> mess<00:01:42.780> with<00:01:42.930> this<00:01:43.110> right<00:01:43.500> now<00:01:43.530> so

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
need to mess with this right now so

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.390 
need to mess with this right now so
always<00:01:45.090> make<00:01:45.300> sure<00:01:45.480> your<00:01:45.840> aid<00:01:46.380> box<00:01:46.980> has<00:01:47.370> a

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.400 
always make sure your aid box has a

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.790 
always make sure your aid box has a
couple<00:01:47.790> tiny<00:01:47.970> holes<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.780> it<00:01:48.930> they<00:01:49.530> don't<00:01:49.620> need

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
couple tiny holes in it they don't need

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.940 
couple tiny holes in it they don't need
to<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.040> more<00:01:50.250> than<00:01:50.430> three<00:01:50.760> millimeters<00:01:51.300> wide

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
to be more than three millimeters wide

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.250 
to be more than three millimeters wide
so<00:01:52.950> make<00:01:53.100> sure<00:01:53.130> that<00:01:53.930> you<00:01:54.930> want<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.170> make<00:01:55.350> sure

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
so make sure that you want to make sure

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.920 
so make sure that you want to make sure
you<00:01:58.260> keep<00:01:58.650> the<00:01:58.830> temp<00:01:59.190> between<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.390> think<00:02:00.780> it's

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
you keep the temp between I think it's

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.580 
you keep the temp between I think it's
82<00:02:01.620> to<00:02:01.950> 90<00:02:02.460> degrees<00:02:02.820> you<00:02:03.120> don't<00:02:03.930> want<00:02:04.050> it<00:02:04.140> too

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
82 to 90 degrees you don't want it too

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:12.370 
82 to 90 degrees you don't want it too
high<00:02:05.510> like<00:02:06.510> Leos<00:02:07.470> yukky<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.310> can't<00:02:08.670> um<00:02:09.830> make<00:02:10.830> a

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
high like Leos yukky you can't um make a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.070 
high like Leos yukky you can't um make a
one<00:02:13.380> sex<00:02:13.740> of<00:02:13.890> a<00:02:14.180> corn<00:02:15.180> snake<00:02:15.330> pretty<00:02:15.900> much

one sex of a corn snake pretty much
you'll<00:02:16.260> just<00:02:16.380> get<00:02:16.530> 50/50<00:02:17.280> and<00:02:19.670> incubator<00:02:20.670> is

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
you'll just get 50/50 and incubator is

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.070 
you'll just get 50/50 and incubator is
pretty<00:02:21.270> smart<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.720> will<00:02:21.959> just<00:02:23.569> do<00:02:24.569> this<00:02:24.720> thing

pretty smart it will just do this thing
you<00:02:25.500> don't<00:02:25.590> need<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.890> turn<00:02:26.100> these<00:02:26.280> reptile

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
you don't need to turn these reptile

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.760 
you don't need to turn these reptile
eggs<00:02:26.970> because<00:02:27.450> just<00:02:27.690> kill<00:02:27.959> them<00:02:28.140> actually<00:02:28.560> so

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
eggs because just kill them actually so

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.880 
eggs because just kill them actually so
make<00:02:28.980> sure<00:02:29.010> try<00:02:29.580> not<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.030> turn<00:02:30.750> them<00:02:31.080> when<00:02:31.739> you

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
make sure try not to turn them when you

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.490 
make sure try not to turn them when you
put<00:02:32.040> them<00:02:32.160> in<00:02:32.780> they<00:02:33.780> usually<00:02:33.930> stay<00:02:34.319> in<00:02:34.350> the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
put them in they usually stay in the

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.280 
put them in they usually stay in the
incubator<00:02:34.800> for<00:02:35.340> about<00:02:35.780> six<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.870> eight<00:02:36.959> weeks

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
incubator for about six to eight weeks

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.309 
incubator for about six to eight weeks
and<00:02:37.590> once<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.790> eggs<00:02:38.970> start<00:02:39.180> kind<00:02:39.989> of<00:02:40.050> dimpling

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
and once the eggs start kind of dimpling

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.030 
and once the eggs start kind of dimpling
in<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:40.980> it's<00:02:41.459> past<00:02:41.790> a<00:02:41.910> six-week<00:02:42.450> process<00:02:43.040> that

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
in and it's past a six-week process that

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.300 
in and it's past a six-week process that
means<00:02:44.400> it's<00:02:44.700> a<00:02:45.290> maybe<00:02:46.290> two<00:02:46.470> three<00:02:46.650> six<00:02:47.070> day

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
means it's a maybe two three six day

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.120 
means it's a maybe two three six day
prior<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.850> hatching<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:49.230> hatchlings<00:02:49.980> are

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
prior to hatching the hatchlings are

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.400 
prior to hatching the hatchlings are
just<00:02:50.370> soaking<00:02:51.330> up<00:02:51.480> all<00:02:51.630> that<00:02:51.690> yolk<00:02:52.080> and
