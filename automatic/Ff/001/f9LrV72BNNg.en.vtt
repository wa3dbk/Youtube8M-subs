just a few things and so I'm gonna show
you<00:00:17.160> some<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.550> pitfalls<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:18.180> things<00:00:18.420> that

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
you some of the pitfalls of things that

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.679 
you some of the pitfalls of things that
I<00:00:18.779> found<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.830> be<00:00:19.859> my<00:00:20.279> issues<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.449> then<00:00:21.570> maybe

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
I found to be my issues so then maybe

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.019 
I found to be my issues so then maybe
you<00:00:21.779> don't<00:00:21.869> repeat<00:00:22.320> them<00:00:22.519> it's<00:00:23.519> not<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.670> it's

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
you don't repeat them it's not that it's

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.939 
you don't repeat them it's not that it's
not<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.300> this<00:00:24.480> floor<00:00:25.050> won't<00:00:25.170> work<00:00:25.410> now<00:00:25.619> it

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
not that this floor won't work now it

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.439 
not that this floor won't work now it
said<00:00:26.340> it<00:00:26.430> just<00:00:26.580> takes<00:00:26.730> more<00:00:26.910> work<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.269> get<00:00:27.420> done

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
said it just takes more work to get done

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.929 
said it just takes more work to get done
so<00:00:27.949> one<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> first<00:00:29.250> things<00:00:29.369> I<00:00:29.490> noticed<00:00:29.789> was

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
so one of the first things I noticed was

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.290 
so one of the first things I noticed was
that<00:00:30.289> whenever<00:00:31.289> I<00:00:31.470> laid<00:00:31.619> the<00:00:31.740> floor<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.250> had<00:00:32.940> not

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
that whenever I laid the floor I had not

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.709 
that whenever I laid the floor I had not
put<00:00:33.690> my<00:00:33.809> my<00:00:34.290> sub<00:00:34.950> floor<00:00:35.190> joist<00:00:35.460> my<00:00:35.940> two<00:00:36.630> by

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
put my my sub floor joist my two by

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.280 
put my my sub floor joist my two by
fours<00:00:36.930> I<00:00:37.550> did<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.700> put<00:00:38.940> them<00:00:39.059> in<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.170> way

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
fours I did not put them in so that way

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.410 
fours I did not put them in so that way
there<00:00:40.469> would<00:00:40.530> be<00:00:40.590> one<00:00:40.860> at<00:00:41.010> each<00:00:41.129> seam<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.820> so

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
there would be one at each seam and so

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.690 
there would be one at each seam and so
what<00:00:42.540> that<00:00:42.570> meant<00:00:42.870> was<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.350> was<00:00:44.340> thinking<00:00:44.670> that

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
what that meant was I was thinking that

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.060 
what that meant was I was thinking that
you<00:00:45.030> know<00:00:45.149> I'll<00:00:45.329> just<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:45.719> ahead<00:00:45.930> and<00:00:46.110> cut<00:00:46.860> the

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
you know I'll just go ahead and cut the

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.400 
you know I'll just go ahead and cut the
the<00:00:47.390> plywood<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.660> way<00:00:48.750> it<00:00:48.840> would<00:00:48.930> you

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
the plywood so that way it would you

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.439 
the plywood so that way it would you
know<00:00:49.530> fit<00:00:49.860> accordingly<00:00:50.399> but<00:00:50.640> really<00:00:51.300> what<00:00:51.420> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
know fit accordingly but really what I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.760 
know fit accordingly but really what I
should<00:00:51.480> have<00:00:51.629> done<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:51.930> just<00:00:51.960> taken<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
should have done is just taken the the

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.560 
should have done is just taken the the
easy<00:00:53.010> route<00:00:53.340> which<00:00:53.550> was<00:00:53.670> putting<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.390> joists

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
easy route which was putting the joists

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.299 
easy route which was putting the joists
where<00:00:54.780> they<00:00:54.870> belong

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
where they belong

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.459 
where they belong
however<00:00:57.090> I<00:00:57.149> didn't<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:57.719> and<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.109> took<00:00:58.289> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
however I didn't do that and I took the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.319 
however I didn't do that and I took the
hard<00:00:58.710> route<00:00:58.920> which<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.550> cut<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> joist<00:01:00.090> or

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
hard route which is to cut the joist or

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.869 
hard route which is to cut the joist or
the<00:01:00.570> plywood<00:01:01.230> up<00:01:01.320> into<00:01:01.590> several<00:01:01.800> pieces<00:01:01.980> which

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
the plywood up into several pieces which

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.090 
the plywood up into several pieces which
once<00:01:03.719> again<00:01:03.930> it's<00:01:04.350> not<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.710> won't<00:01:04.830> work

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
once again it's not that it won't work

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.649 
once again it's not that it won't work
it's<00:01:05.400> just<00:01:05.489> that<00:01:05.760> you<00:01:05.909> end<00:01:06.090> up<00:01:06.180> with<00:01:06.330> a<00:01:06.360> lot

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
alright so first things first I bought a

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.030 
alright so first things first I bought a
piece<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.210> plywood<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.380> I<00:01:22.590> should<00:01:22.860> not<00:01:23.009> have

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
piece of plywood that I should not have

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.340 
piece of plywood that I should not have
bought<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.820> was<00:01:24.240> slightly<00:01:24.420> des<00:01:24.720> laminated<00:01:25.229> I

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
bought it was slightly des laminated I

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.420 
bought it was slightly des laminated I
thought<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.680> would<00:01:25.770> be<00:01:25.860> fine<00:01:26.009> but<00:01:26.220> it's<00:01:26.340> been

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
thought it would be fine but it's been

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.800 
thought it would be fine but it's been
raining<00:01:26.759> a<00:01:26.820> lot<00:01:26.909> here<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.299> even<00:01:27.509> though<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
raining a lot here and even though the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:28.940 
raining a lot here and even though the
floor<00:01:28.140> was<00:01:28.320> covered<00:01:28.500> up

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
floor was covered up

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.300 
floor was covered up
it<00:01:29.430> was<00:01:29.810> the<00:01:30.810> humidity<00:01:31.259> caused<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:31.979> to

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
it was the humidity caused it to

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.910 
it was the humidity caused it to
delaminate<00:01:32.689> even<00:01:33.689> more<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.590> what

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
delaminate even more and so what

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.289 
delaminate even more and so what
happened<00:01:35.280> is<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.700> actually<00:01:36.090> have<00:01:36.210> this

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
happened is you actually have this

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.870 
happened is you actually have this
bowing<00:01:36.750> effect<00:01:37.079> that<00:01:37.710> caused<00:01:38.250> from<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.670> and

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
bowing effect that caused from that and

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.910 
bowing effect that caused from that and
there's<00:01:39.090> also<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.900> know<00:01:40.020> bubbling<00:01:40.259> down

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
there's also you know bubbling down

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.260 
there's also you know bubbling down
along<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> way<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.850> makes<00:01:42.000> it<00:01:42.119> completely

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
along the way it makes it completely

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.700 
along the way it makes it completely
unusable<00:01:42.810> so<00:01:43.110> I<00:01:43.170> can't<00:01:43.350> really<00:01:43.470> do<00:01:43.649> anything

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
unusable so I can't really do anything

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.590 
unusable so I can't really do anything
about<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:44.939> went<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.180> buy<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.329> new<00:01:45.450> piece

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
about that so I went to buy a new piece

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.510 
about that so I went to buy a new piece
of<00:01:45.630> 3<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.619> 1/4<00:01:47.030> plywood<00:01:48.030> which<00:01:48.420> means<00:01:48.750> that

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
of 3 and 1/4 plywood which means that

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.190 
of 3 and 1/4 plywood which means that
you<00:01:50.520> know<00:01:50.610> I'm<00:01:50.670> out<00:01:50.790> another<00:01:51.090> 25<00:01:51.210> bucks<00:01:51.659> you

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
you know I'm out another 25 bucks you

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.810 
you know I'm out another 25 bucks you
know<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.560> there<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:52.950> can<00:01:53.100> see<00:01:53.280> actually<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
know and there you can see actually the

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.139 
know and there you can see actually the
bubbling<00:01:54.210> right<00:01:54.329> there<00:01:55.399> so<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.790> part<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
bubbling right there so that part is

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.319 
bubbling right there so that part is
just<00:01:57.840> completely<00:01:58.170> unusable<00:01:58.640> so<00:01:59.640> the<00:02:00.210> other

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
just completely unusable so the other

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.760 
just completely unusable so the other
part<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:00.630> did<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.049> this<00:02:01.259> whole<00:02:01.469> thing<00:02:01.649> is

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
part I did was that this whole thing is

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.850 
part I did was that this whole thing is
supposed<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.450> six<00:02:03.450> solid<00:02:03.899> pieces<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.740> are

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
supposed to be six solid pieces that are

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.310 
supposed to be six solid pieces that are
just<00:02:04.890> cut<00:02:05.280> to<00:02:05.549> fit<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.540> what<00:02:06.659> I<00:02:06.689> did<00:02:06.869> wrong<00:02:07.079> was

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
just cut to fit but what I did wrong was

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.960 
just cut to fit but what I did wrong was
that<00:02:07.350> whenever<00:02:07.649> I've<00:02:07.799> installed<00:02:08.250> my<00:02:08.369> joists<00:02:08.729> I

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
that whenever I've installed my joists I

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.639 
that whenever I've installed my joists I
installed<00:02:09.539> them<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.140> they<00:02:10.259> fit<00:02:10.500> on<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
installed them so they fit on the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.140 
installed them so they fit on the
trailer<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.009> then<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.310> didn't<00:02:11.580> go<00:02:11.670> back<00:02:11.879> and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
trailer and then I didn't go back and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.809 
trailer and then I didn't go back and
make<00:02:12.720> sure<00:02:12.930> that<00:02:13.080> I<00:02:13.170> had<00:02:13.319> joy

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
make sure that I had joy

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.440 
make sure that I had joy
at<00:02:13.909> eight<00:02:14.599> feet<00:02:14.989> intervals<00:02:15.500> to<00:02:16.129> fit<00:02:16.519> an<00:02:16.849> 8<00:02:17.209> foot

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
at eight feet intervals to fit an 8 foot

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.110 
at eight feet intervals to fit an 8 foot
long<00:02:17.690> piece<00:02:18.110> of<00:02:18.260> plywood<00:02:18.440> so<00:02:18.950> what<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.610> did<00:02:19.730> was

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
long piece of plywood so what I did was

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:21.550 
long piece of plywood so what I did was
I<00:02:20.269> thought<00:02:20.420> well<00:02:20.629> you<00:02:20.930> know<00:02:20.959> I'll<00:02:21.110> just<00:02:21.290> cut

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
I thought well you know I'll just cut

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.580 
I thought well you know I'll just cut
some<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.159> I'll<00:02:22.940> cut<00:02:23.180> it<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:24.170> know<00:02:24.260> make

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
some and I'll cut it and you know make

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.500 
some and I'll cut it and you know make
sure<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.769> can<00:02:24.950> lay<00:02:25.099> it<00:02:25.190> in<00:02:25.280> there<00:02:25.459> correctly<00:02:25.580> the

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
sure I can lay it in there correctly the

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.300 
sure I can lay it in there correctly the
downside<00:02:26.900> to<00:02:27.019> doing<00:02:27.049> that<00:02:27.379> is<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:27.739> I<00:02:27.920> end<00:02:28.010> up

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.310 
downside to doing that is that I end up

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.850 
downside to doing that is that I end up
with<00:02:28.370> a<00:02:28.640> lot<00:02:28.909> more<00:02:28.940> work<00:02:29.450> because<00:02:30.379> now<00:02:30.500> I<00:02:30.530> have

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
with a lot more work because now I have

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.119 
with a lot more work because now I have
extra<00:02:31.730> pieces<00:02:31.910> along<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.390> way<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:33.680> also<00:02:33.799> means

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
extra pieces along the way it also means

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.520 
extra pieces along the way it also means
that<00:02:34.510> you<00:02:35.510> know<00:02:35.599> I<00:02:35.629> might<00:02:35.840> have<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:36.290> buy<00:02:36.410> an

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
that you know I might have to buy an

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.440 
that you know I might have to buy an
extra<00:02:36.590> piece<00:02:36.890> I<00:02:37.190> didn't<00:02:37.760> have<00:02:37.879> to<00:02:38.060> originally

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
extra piece I didn't have to originally

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.330 
extra piece I didn't have to originally
until<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.780> delamination<00:02:39.319> problem<00:02:39.769> of<00:02:40.099> one<00:02:40.250> of

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
until the delamination problem of one of

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.729 
until the delamination problem of one of
them<00:02:40.599> but<00:02:41.599> it<00:02:41.720> is<00:02:41.810> a<00:02:41.840> problem<00:02:42.170> you<00:02:42.260> could<00:02:42.560> run

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:42.739 
them but it is a problem you could run

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.250 
them but it is a problem you could run
into<00:02:43.450> other<00:02:44.450> than<00:02:44.629> that<00:02:44.720> everything<00:02:45.079> is<00:02:45.140> going

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
into other than that everything is going

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.949 
into other than that everything is going
pretty<00:02:45.409> well<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:46.069> have<00:02:46.640> the<00:02:47.329> floor<00:02:47.569> going<00:02:47.720> in

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 
pretty well I have the floor going in

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.539 
pretty well I have the floor going in
it's<00:02:48.260> going<00:02:48.410> in<00:02:48.590> fine<00:02:48.769> it<00:02:48.950> just<00:02:48.980> takes<00:02:49.280> extra

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
it's going in fine it just takes extra

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:50.940 
it's going in fine it just takes extra
work<00:02:49.670> because<00:02:49.790> I'm<00:02:50.030> having<00:02:50.299> to<00:02:50.450> do<00:02:50.569> more

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
work because I'm having to do more

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.589 
work because I'm having to do more
nailing<00:02:51.950> and<00:02:52.069> more<00:02:52.250> measuring<00:02:53.030> the<00:02:53.480> other

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
nailing and more measuring the other

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.000 
nailing and more measuring the other
thing<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.840> did<00:02:54.079> do<00:02:54.260> and<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.620> can<00:02:54.739> hear<00:02:54.890> my

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
thing I did do and you can hear my

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.979 
thing I did do and you can hear my
neighbors<00:02:55.459> screaming<00:02:55.849> like<00:02:56.090> crazy<00:02:56.510> right<00:02:56.870> now

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
neighbors screaming like crazy right now

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:58.569 
neighbors screaming like crazy right now
sorry<00:02:57.410> about<00:02:57.440> that

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:58.579 
sorry about that

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:00.630 
sorry about that
the<00:02:59.329> other<00:02:59.450> thing<00:02:59.569> I<00:02:59.660> did<00:02:59.720> do<00:03:00.019> is<00:03:00.230> I<00:03:00.260> actually

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
the other thing I did do is I actually

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.170 
the other thing I did do is I actually
put<00:03:01.640> in<00:03:01.790> Center<00:03:03.069> Center<00:03:04.099> joists<00:03:04.700> and<00:03:04.970> that's

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
put in Center Center joists and that's

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.720 
put in Center Center joists and that's
just<00:03:05.629> because<00:03:06.349> I<00:03:06.379> felt<00:03:06.769> that<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.099> 16<00:03:07.430> inches

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
just because I felt that the 16 inches

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.289 
just because I felt that the 16 inches
apart<00:03:08.540> while<00:03:08.750> it<00:03:08.870> was<00:03:09.049> fine<00:03:09.379> for<00:03:09.590> a<00:03:09.650> 3/4<00:03:10.160> inch

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
apart while it was fine for a 3/4 inch

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.300 
apart while it was fine for a 3/4 inch
for<00:03:11.299> a<00:03:11.329> 3/4<00:03:11.660> inch<00:03:11.690> floor<00:03:12.019> it<00:03:12.560> just<00:03:12.769> I<00:03:12.890> wanted<00:03:13.220> a

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
for a 3/4 inch floor it just I wanted a

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.280 
for a 3/4 inch floor it just I wanted a
little<00:03:13.489> bit<00:03:13.640> more<00:03:13.700> sturdiness<00:03:14.359> along<00:03:15.049> the

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
little bit more sturdiness along the

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.410 
little bit more sturdiness along the
center<00:03:16.160> length<00:03:16.370> of<00:03:16.579> this<00:03:16.730> floor<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:17.239> that's

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
center length of this floor so that's
