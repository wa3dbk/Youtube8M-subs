does affect how the media appears in

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
does affect how the media appears in
your<00:01:22.920> final<00:01:23.130> video<00:01:23.340> that's<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.659> while

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
your final video that's because while

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.719 
your final video that's because while

appears in the video it also shows the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.190 
appears in the video it also shows the
order<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.820> which<00:01:29.850> media<00:01:30.360> is<00:01:30.540> stacked<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.170> top

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
of each other in the video you can think

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.530 
of each other in the video you can think
of<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.770> timeline<00:01:35.040> almost<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:35.909> sideways

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
of the timeline almost as a sideways

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.260 
of the timeline almost as a sideways
view<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.049> media<00:01:37.350> while<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.490> canvas<00:01:39.000> is<00:01:39.210> a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
view of the media while the canvas is a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.460 
view of the media while the canvas is a
top-down<00:01:40.079> view<00:01:40.140> of<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.280> timeline<00:01:41.670> tracks<00:01:42.470> so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
top-down view of the timeline tracks so

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.590 
top-down view of the timeline tracks so
because<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.250> timeline<00:01:44.640> shows<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.119> stacking

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
because the timeline shows the stacking

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.389 
because the timeline shows the stacking
order<00:01:45.720> this<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.619> sometimes<00:01:46.860> called<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
order this is sometimes called the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.389 
order this is sometimes called the
z-order<00:01:48.259> placing<00:01:49.259> any<00:01:49.409> media<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.070> higher

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
z-order placing any media on a higher

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.460 
z-order placing any media on a higher
track<00:01:50.790> on<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.060> timeline<00:01:51.270> will<00:01:52.170> move<00:01:52.320> it

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
track on the timeline will move it

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.130 
track on the timeline will move it
higher<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.310> stacking<00:01:53.729> order<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.149> thus

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
higher in the stacking order and thus

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.069 
higher in the stacking order and thus
moving<00:01:55.950> media<00:01:56.280> up<00:01:56.490> in<00:01:56.790> the<00:01:57.149> timeline<00:01:57.390> will

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
moving media up in the timeline will

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.039
