00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.710
 york and I'm on tv rola 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.080
 when 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.810
 again see those palms for example that 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.150
 they seem to reach the sky 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:18.690
 these are wax palms my dad says 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:18.690
 well, only 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.410
 he imagines what they achieve that is 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:25.410
 100 meters 100 more 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.770
 it's a very very happy moment for me is 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:42.620
 a giant achievement to have nominations in 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:46.550
 tv and novels in india catalina and 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.580
 I'm very proud that you found it 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.600
 won the nomination of those two awards 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:56.079
 so cool and the truth 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:59.620
 what I have already experienced in recording to 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:01.750
 yachts but already returning to Colombia to 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.170
 record the capo and I feel pretty 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.970
 winner the truth then I do not know if I 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.560
 is going to play a prize or not but only 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.110
 will be there celebrating with everyone will be 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.110
 a very very funny very happy moment 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.299
 I thought I'm going to say no 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.700
 why 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.850
 and for many things 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.549
 I do not know maybe I'm a little bit 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.930
 prevented with everything that what has 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:39.290
 past 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.290
 but on the other hand asking for it with me was 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.930
 force her to give up her family I do not 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:48.350
 knew what to expect or from the project to 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.689
 yachts but neither of the character 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.310
 I had never worked in Colombia or in 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:55.700
 a novel or anything then did not have 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.440
 as a knowledge of the thing what 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.770
 I can say is that I got a lot of heart 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:02.960
 there to the character we both the 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.630
 we really live very strong things and very 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.600
 chÃ©veres because as much as for david 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.239
 where there was to love was the 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.700
 First moment working in Colombia 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:15.440
 so we both mix a lot and 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.690
 we share some things in life 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.000
 real that was like 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.480
 copying itself into the novel if it 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.480
 can you say so 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:37.560
 to this criminal now but I wanted to 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.560
 consult something important 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.660
 my character in the field is 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.150
 completely different where it was was 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.550
 a very tender person very very 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.260
 grid and this character that I do 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.570
 in the field he is an agent of the dea but 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.940
 with an agent as already more rebellious than 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.250
 break all the schemes and it goes like 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.650
 quitting from area iii and then to 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.620
 to fight 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:06.390
 in his own way then he presented 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:11.519
 like some other challenges is a one 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:14.450
 person as more let's say military in 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:17.930
 some senses stronger 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.290
 and the truth was it was very funny 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:26.290
 have another character in Spanish in the 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.290
 Latin format to enjoy 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.790
 I think the most important thing of each 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:47.379
 person that one is like forming is 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.299
 look for something similar that the 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:51.370
 person that I have for example with the 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:54.010
 character that is something thematic that is 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.379
 be a shared story that is a 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.349
 motivation to be able to relate 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.659
 personally with the character then there is 

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:03.959
 what to look for as the way of speaking the 

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:07.510
 way to walk the way 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:09.549
 relate to people in the case of 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:13.000
 this agent of the dea that says for the 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:15.400
 capo was to study the police and the 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.650
 agents of the dea to talk to them about 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.989
 your work on about your motivations 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.570
 to take that into account when one 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:24.759
 it goes like forming someone who is a 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.199
 little vagina hello I'm the doctor 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:28.780
 open the door and I've been 10 years 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:30.820

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.169
 theory of weight and chronic diseases 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.659
 associated with the ub 

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:38.419
 Colombia now has a very market 

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:40.729
 strong are doing a lot of content 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:44.419
 for television they are making movies 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:47.240
 the world is growing more and more 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:50.330
 smaller and the things that are 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.939
 making colombia go for usa they go for 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.219
 europe go to other countries latina in 

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.919
 Latin America there is a lot of opportunity and 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:05:01.370
 you have to study you have to work hard 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:04.820
 and you have to arrive wanting to do the 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:09.620
 things well to your intelligence 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.620
