00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.050 

all<00:00:01.020> right<00:00:01.260> the<00:00:01.800> very<00:00:02.010> first<00:00:02.310> step<00:00:02.399> of<00:00:02.730> solving

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
all right the very first step of solving

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.269 
all right the very first step of solving
the<00:00:03.090> rubik's<00:00:03.389> cube<00:00:03.629> is<00:00:03.840> to<00:00:03.990> get<00:00:04.140> across<00:00:04.680> on<00:00:05.069> one

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
the rubik's cube is to get across on one

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.070 
the rubik's cube is to get across on one
side<00:00:05.490> for<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:05.970> sake<00:00:06.150> of<00:00:06.180> simplicity<00:00:06.450> i<00:00:06.839> will

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:07.080 
side for the sake of simplicity i will

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.580 
side for the sake of simplicity i will
start<00:00:07.290> at<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.410> green<00:00:07.589> side<00:00:08.960> but<00:00:09.960> what<00:00:10.559> you

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
start at the green side but what you

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.129 
start at the green side but what you
want<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.860> do<00:00:10.980> as<00:00:11.219> well<00:00:12.059> as<00:00:12.240> get<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.630> cross<00:00:12.870> you

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
want to do as well as get the cross you

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.330 
want to do as well as get the cross you
want<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.349> make<00:00:13.440> sure<00:00:13.469> that<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:14.070> cross

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
want to make sure that the cross

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.150 
want to make sure that the cross
connects<00:00:15.000> to<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.330> middle<00:00:15.599> piece<00:00:15.830> for<00:00:16.830> example

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
connects to the middle piece for example

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.120 
connects to the middle piece for example
here<00:00:17.190> it's<00:00:17.490> white<00:00:17.820> why<00:00:18.330> green<00:00:19.050> green<00:00:19.470> here

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
here it's white why green green here

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.790 
here it's white why green green here
you're<00:00:20.340> going<00:00:20.490> to<00:00:20.550> want<00:00:20.730> blue<00:00:21.119> blue<00:00:21.900> green

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
you're going to want blue blue green

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.679 
you're going to want blue blue green
green<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.490> then<00:00:23.730> here<00:00:24.000> you'd<00:00:24.180> want<00:00:24.420> orange

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
green and then here you'd want orange

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.700 
green and then here you'd want orange
orange<00:00:25.080> green<00:00:25.470> green<00:00:26.039> so<00:00:27.230> this<00:00:28.230> part<00:00:28.500> is

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
orange green green so this part is

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.890 
orange green green so this part is
actually<00:00:29.279> I<00:00:29.880> can't<00:00:30.150> really<00:00:30.330> teach<00:00:30.599> it<00:00:30.869> you

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
actually I can't really teach it you

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.330 
actually I can't really teach it you
really<00:00:31.349> just<00:00:31.500> have<00:00:31.619> to<00:00:31.740> mess<00:00:31.890> with<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.130> cube

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
really just have to mess with the cube

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.010 
really just have to mess with the cube
for<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.059> couple<00:00:33.270> hours<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.719> your<00:00:33.899> own

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
for for a couple hours on your own

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.940 
for for a couple hours on your own
figure<00:00:34.950> it<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.130> and<00:00:36.290> once<00:00:37.290> you<00:00:37.469> go<00:00:37.620> from<00:00:37.770> there

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
figure it out and once you go from there

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.030 
figure it out and once you go from there
it<00:00:38.129> just<00:00:38.160> gets<00:00:38.520> simpler<00:00:38.879> it's<00:00:39.870> all<00:00:40.110> about<00:00:40.140> user

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
it just gets simpler it's all about user

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.080 
it just gets simpler it's all about user
experience<00:00:41.129> here<00:00:41.820> so<00:00:43.430> an<00:00:44.430> easy<00:00:44.640> way<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.059> I

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
experience here so an easy way that I

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.270 
experience here so an easy way that I
might<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.390> able<00:00:45.450> to<00:00:45.570> help<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.930> is<00:00:46.200> to<00:00:46.260> get<00:00:46.620> tell

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
might be able to help you is to get tell

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.299 
might be able to help you is to get tell
you<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.520> get<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:48.570> Green<00:00:48.750> Peace<00:00:48.930> Center<00:00:49.770> up

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
you to get the Green Peace Center up

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.459 
you to get the Green Peace Center up
here<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:50.969> then<00:00:51.539> rotate<00:00:51.930> it<00:00:52.020> all<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.379> way

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
here and then rotate it all the way

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.799 
here and then rotate it all the way
around<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.160> it's<00:00:53.460> at<00:00:53.640> the<00:00:53.760> bottom<00:00:53.940> see

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
around so that it's at the bottom see

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.080 
around so that it's at the bottom see
and<00:00:55.079> then<00:00:55.710> rotate<00:00:56.100> it<00:00:56.250> once<00:00:56.730> it's<00:00:56.879> at<00:00:56.969> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
and then rotate it once it's at the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.880 
and then rotate it once it's at the
bottom<00:00:57.710> one<00:00:58.789> two<00:00:59.789> three<00:01:00.320> rotate<00:01:01.320> it<00:01:01.469> until<00:01:01.559> it

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
bottom one two three rotate it until it

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.889 
bottom one two three rotate it until it
matches<00:01:02.039> up<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.760> peace<00:01:03.059> in<00:01:03.390> the<00:01:03.600> center

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
matches up with the peace in the center

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.960 
matches up with the peace in the center
then<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.290> needs<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.680> be<00:01:04.769> then<00:01:05.729> there's<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
then it needs to be then there's the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.140 
then it needs to be then there's the
green<00:01:06.210> and<00:01:06.510> it's<00:01:06.630> middle<00:01:07.100> silver<00:01:08.100> lode<00:01:08.670> rotate

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
green and it's middle silver lode rotate

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.390 
green and it's middle silver lode rotate
it<00:01:09.240> twice<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.590> catches<00:01:10.799> up<00:01:10.979> with<00:01:11.100> here

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it twice so that it catches up with here

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.940 
it twice so that it catches up with here
and<00:01:11.549> now<00:01:12.119> you've<00:01:12.240> got<00:01:12.420> silver<00:01:13.229> silver<00:01:13.680> green

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
and now you've got silver silver green

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.679 
and now you've got silver silver green
green<00:01:14.990> white<00:01:15.990> white<00:01:16.320> green<00:01:16.740> green<00:01:17.689> there's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
green white white green green there's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.690 
green white white green green there's
really<00:01:18.990> absolutely<00:01:19.560> no<00:01:19.890> algorithms<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.520> need

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
really absolutely no algorithms you need

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.580 
really absolutely no algorithms you need
to<00:01:20.820> know<00:01:20.939> for<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.270> situation<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.409> all

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
to know for this situation and it's all

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.710 
to know for this situation and it's all
logic<00:01:23.369> okay<00:01:23.780> for<00:01:24.780> example<00:01:25.200> right<00:01:25.350> here<00:01:25.560> is

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:26.720 
logic okay for example right here is

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.840 
logic okay for example right here is
orange<00:01:27.720> green<00:01:27.990> here's<00:01:28.500> an<00:01:28.619> orange<00:01:28.950> if<00:01:29.100> you

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
orange green here's an orange if you

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.560 
orange green here's an orange if you
want<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.240> turn<00:01:30.450> it<00:01:30.659> once<00:01:30.990> like<00:01:31.229> this<00:01:31.970> and<00:01:32.970> it

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
want to turn it once like this and it

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.270 
want to turn it once like this and it
will<00:01:33.600> match<00:01:33.840> up<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.259> orange<00:01:34.920> then<00:01:35.220> you

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
will match up with the orange then you

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.890 
will match up with the orange then you
can<00:01:35.430> turn<00:01:35.549> it<00:01:35.700> once<00:01:35.820> more<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.630> you'll<00:01:36.750> match

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
can turn it once more and you'll match

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.660 
can turn it once more and you'll match
up<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.229> green<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:40.159> just<00:01:41.159> you've<00:01:41.460> only

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
up with the green and just you've only

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.950 
up with the green and just you've only
got<00:01:41.850> one<00:01:41.880> more<00:01:42.119> side<00:01:42.329> do<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.659> there's<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
got one more side do and there's the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.660 
got one more side do and there's the
green<00:01:43.110> that<00:01:43.290> has<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.560> go<00:01:43.710> there<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.549> I'm<00:01:44.610> going

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
green that has to go there so I'm going

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.020 
green that has to go there so I'm going
to<00:01:44.790> turn<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.149> screen<00:01:45.590> over<00:01:46.590> then<00:01:47.340> rotate<00:01:47.759> what

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
to turn the screen over then rotate what

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.719 
to turn the screen over then rotate what
until<00:01:48.960> I've<00:01:49.020> got<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.259> cross<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:50.430> step<00:01:50.610> is

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
until I've got the cross this step is

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.109 
until I've got the cross this step is
very<00:01:50.880> simple<00:01:51.680> of<00:01:52.680> course<00:01:53.280> when<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:53.670> first<00:01:53.939> try

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
very simple of course when you first try

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.959 
very simple of course when you first try
it<00:01:54.210> will<00:01:54.720> be<00:01:54.869> difficult<00:01:55.079> but<00:01:55.770> just<00:01:56.670> keep

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
it will be difficult but just keep
