to 350 I'm going to Greece on this pan

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:33.219 
to 350 I'm going to Greece on this pan
and<00:05:30.590> then<00:05:31.280> we'll<00:05:31.460> flower<00:05:31.939> it<00:05:32.270> so<00:05:32.689> it<00:05:32.810> comes<00:05:33.020> out

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
and then we'll flower it so it comes out

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.879 
and then we'll flower it so it comes out
really<00:05:33.469> easy<00:05:33.860> just<00:05:34.789> make<00:05:35.060> sure<00:05:35.710> you<00:05:36.710> do<00:05:36.860> it

00:05:36.879 --> 00:05:36.889 
really easy just make sure you do it

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.999 
really easy just make sure you do it
kind<00:05:37.129> of<00:05:37.219> generously<00:05:37.879> I<00:05:38.319> run<00:05:39.319> my<00:05:39.529> neighbor<00:05:39.740> hot

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
kind of generously I run my neighbor hot

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:43.390 
kind of generously I run my neighbor hot
water<00:05:40.250> and<00:05:40.610> then<00:05:40.729> just<00:05:40.939> use<00:05:41.919> organic<00:05:42.919> butter

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.400 
water and then just use organic butter

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:45.249 
water and then just use organic butter
over<00:05:43.729> it<00:05:43.849> I<00:05:44.029> think<00:05:44.330> it's<00:05:44.449> a<00:05:44.539> little<00:05:44.659> bit<00:05:44.840> easier

00:05:45.249 --> 00:05:45.259 
over it I think it's a little bit easier

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:48.550 
over it I think it's a little bit easier
than<00:05:45.469> spraying<00:05:46.159> or<00:05:46.900> anything<00:05:47.900> like<00:05:47.960> that<00:05:48.080> so

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
than spraying or anything like that so

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.879 
than spraying or anything like that so
how<00:05:49.430> I<00:05:49.460> do<00:05:49.669> it<00:05:50.020> you<00:05:51.020> can<00:05:51.169> add<00:05:51.349> a<00:05:51.379> little<00:05:51.650> bit<00:05:51.830> of

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:51.889 
how I do it you can add a little bit of

00:05:51.889 --> 00:06:00.450 
how I do it you can add a little bit of
flour<00:05:52.219> in<00:05:52.490> here<00:05:58.120> and<00:05:59.120> just<00:05:59.629> got<00:05:59.930> it<00:05:59.960> around

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:00.460 
flour in here and just got it around

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:02.830 
flour in here and just got it around
make<00:06:01.460> sure<00:06:01.520> you<00:06:01.759> get<00:06:01.879> all<00:06:02.029> the<00:06:02.060> sides<00:06:02.449> and

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 
make sure you get all the sides and

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:08.559 
make sure you get all the sides and
everything<00:06:03.289> so<00:06:03.740> nothing<00:06:04.370> sticks<00:06:07.330> okay<00:06:08.330> and

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:08.569 
everything so nothing sticks okay and

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:10.769 
everything so nothing sticks okay and
we're<00:06:09.229> just<00:06:09.319> going<00:06:09.440> to<00:06:09.560> pour<00:06:09.889> our<00:06:10.190> mixture

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:10.779 
we're just going to pour our mixture

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:38.990 
we're just going to pour our mixture
into<00:06:11.779> here

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.610 

okay<00:06:40.000> and<00:06:40.270> it<00:06:40.660> looks<00:06:40.810> like<00:06:40.900> that<00:06:41.200> I'm<00:06:41.440> going<00:06:41.530> to

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:41.620 
okay and it looks like that I'm going to

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:42.930 
okay and it looks like that I'm going to
throw<00:06:41.740> it<00:06:41.830> in<00:06:41.890> the<00:06:41.950> oven<00:06:42.010> and<00:06:42.490> you<00:06:42.730> want<00:06:42.880> to

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
throw it in the oven and you want to

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.110 
throw it in the oven and you want to

bake it at 350 for about 60 minutes keep

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.320 
bake it at 350 for about 60 minutes keep
checking<00:06:46.150> it<00:06:46.570> you<00:06:46.690> don't<00:06:46.870> want<00:06:46.900> it<00:06:47.050> to<00:06:47.140> get<00:06:47.260> too
