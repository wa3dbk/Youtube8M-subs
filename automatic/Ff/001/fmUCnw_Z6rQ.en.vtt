prior<00:00:19.860> to<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.369> a<00:00:20.939> double<00:00:21.180> moment<00:00:21.590> they're<00:00:22.590> all

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
prior to and a double moment they're all

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.600 
prior to and a double moment they're all
a<00:00:22.710> little<00:00:22.830> bit<00:00:22.920> different<00:00:23.310> they<00:00:23.369> all<00:00:23.400> have

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.610 
a little bit different they all have

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.890 
a little bit different they all have
different<00:00:23.910> features<00:00:24.060> and<00:00:24.510> different

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
different features and different

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.260 
different features and different
construction<00:00:25.860> so<00:00:26.520> first<00:00:26.730> let's<00:00:26.880> talk<00:00:27.000> about

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:27.270 
construction so first let's talk about

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.749 
construction so first let's talk about
how<00:00:27.390> they're<00:00:27.540> supported<00:00:28.400> the<00:00:29.400> double<00:00:29.669> rainbow

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:29.759 
how they're supported the double rainbow

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.790 
how they're supported the double rainbow

the stripes part two right here the
general<00:00:56.039> design<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.730> double<00:00:56.969> rainbow<00:00:57.089> is

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
general design of the double rainbow is

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.200 
general design of the double rainbow is
what<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:57.989> would<00:00:58.170> call<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.530> hyper<00:00:58.769> double<00:00:59.250> wall<00:00:59.429> so

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
what I would call a hyper double wall so

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.779 
what I would call a hyper double wall so
there<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> vestibule<00:01:01.079> on<00:01:01.260> both<00:01:01.530> sides<00:01:01.800> and

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
there is a vestibule on both sides and

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.960 
there is a vestibule on both sides and
then<00:01:02.910> inside<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.480> is<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.780> mesh<00:01:04.680> wall<00:01:05.190> it<00:01:05.760> gets

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
then inside that is a mesh wall it gets

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.370 
then inside that is a mesh wall it gets
you<00:01:06.030> in<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.240> out<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.450> interior<00:01:06.780> up
