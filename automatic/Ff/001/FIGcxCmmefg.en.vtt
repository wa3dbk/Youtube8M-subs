 minecraft that is man's love well 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.190
 all know that there are certain such 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:42.890
 Minecraft skins 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:44.690
 each of them has a head like this 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.440
 you can get your head because 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.010
 minecraft 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.520
 as far as the wave from version 15 or 14 were 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.180
 added such a head here is a skull 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.390
 Tomsk is 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:01.670
 if this zombie mate is an ordinary head 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:05.470
 Steve is such a head 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:10.159
 the creeper will now show you her too and 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:13.120
 running here and the goal creeper but with 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:17.120
 version 1 7 2 both added feature 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.140
 getting the heads of any players a 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.020
 minecraft 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.510
 without plug-ins without mods without anything 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:30.850
 in a single world or on a server it doesn't matter 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:34.220
 so now let's set the time set 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.250
 just so that we could not 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.920
 disturbed like this well let's get down to 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:43.549
 general look now can see such 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.140
 stand with heads it's different heads 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.720
 players on the top row are heads 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.299
 players all feet on some who 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.340
 play on bald server by the way from 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:55.340
 server players watching it found itself 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.409
 then put like that here just 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.259
 random some skins nectar heads 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.990
 which is just so randomly I decided 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:07.229
 add something to demonstrate that 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:10.619
 so many goals can 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.420
 be and so get any head 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.250
 Player including its you 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.200
 which command will be 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.870
 description for this video 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.629
 she will be right in the description below 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.290
 immediately see this command optimal 

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.060
 version 1 7 2 or higher 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:30.360
 if below she wakes up works in general 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:36.000

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:50.549
 nickname minecraft 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.230
 that's the way I did not register my 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.530
 nickname 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.450

 she is the same as mine now i will press f5 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:22.680
 what could you compare here these heads here 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.569
 so they look it my heads if o 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.660
 then of course they will be infinite 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.400
 amount and so such a cola can 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.489
 get any person including 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.930
 your if only you had a weight of 12 not 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:40.049
 creative well there or one certainly doesn’t matter 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.310
 so well that, let's move on me 

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:47.310
 really liked the idea of ​​putting heads on 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.370
 these are carved stone bricks and 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:52.290
 on a block of oak or there is birch 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.040
 they look really good because 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:56.730
 they look like you see 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.370
 frames 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.900
 it's very cool so and what kind of head 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:03.840
 can do on the server let's say 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.150
 some stand let your trophies 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.510
 if there 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:11.799
 if it is allowed to sowing or else where 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:15.620
 it does not matter here is a good combination 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:18.039
 so go ahead you can make different 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.120
 creepy things like you see such a 100 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:22.430
 sacrifice that is here here 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.520
 redstone in the form of blood can 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.850
 use also hatchet everlasting it 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:32.240
 just because the skull and the usual skull 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:33.889
 head night and because cast 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.949
 minecraft development also in chests 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.380
 you can also put your head signed 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:41.479
 yes here at night here in this case but 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.850
 when skull rotten flesh spider eyes 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.389
 this is just where I would like you 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.979
 show also different server types 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:52.720
 hipixel and you could see 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:55.639
 and here are these stands skinny pedestals 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:57.740
 correctly call them with different 

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.780
 in some places on leasing above 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.460
 so here you can on your server the same 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.930
 the most to do if you have a server 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:06.199
 with mini games or something like that 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:08.180
 that is, you can just find out some 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:10.160
 players who you think are there 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.860
 first second third place here 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.190
 such here is the stand it is iron gold blocks 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.630
 diamond and sign here is the third place 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.260
 first place second place and so on 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:23.240
 so on 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.000
 the last one wanted to say is that 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:27.620
 head can be placed in any absolutely 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.380
 position that is, they can be different 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:37.099
 twist the video here as shown with 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.260
