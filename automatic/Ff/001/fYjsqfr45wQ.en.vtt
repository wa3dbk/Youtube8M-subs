00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.340
 well I have a common problem today 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:19.869
 typical of computers on 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:22.660
 table is that it is a problem caused by a 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.790
 small simple detail also we who 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.009
 happens a lot on these machines first 

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.599
 I'll tell you what's happening in the 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:31.560
 order of service the customer gave me that 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:33.850
 the machine is turning off after 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.910
 12 minutes on 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.340
 so we'll turn on the computer and see 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:41.680
 if this really comes or raise a 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.449
 the camera here I got here in 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.920
 down in the bottom corner of the screen 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.140
 can see if the computer is 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:53.010
 initiating 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.010
 he opened the part of the beaux beginning 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:00.010
 Let's see if this problem is continues if 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.399
 the machine really shuts off after 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.399
 few seconds 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.100
 so that's right there the machine after 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:21.540
 After a few seconds she hung up. 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.190
 Just a few people, what can be the 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.260
 this problem 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:30.870
 the internal might even be more if it were 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.380
 internal and it was going to take a long time 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:36.690
 disconnect that piece of aluminum 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:39.630
 sink it's warm it would take time 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.190
 enough time to warm up and then 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.470
 he is turning off 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:49.670
 I believe this after 23 minutes 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:49.670
 maybe even more of a personal problem is 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.630
 the pain is loose 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:27.570
 good staff is now removed 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:29.550
 problem here is the problem to break 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.959
 two beams 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:38.430
 here is profit from the heatsink and the cooler 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:41.280
 they break this cooler guys here 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:45.060
 very easy to happen this is very easy 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.410
 no spoon of the original intel is already common 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:52.800
 to break 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:55.470
 generally port is by not being handled 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.030
 correctly this one then he 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.340
 happens much more often 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:03.300
 because these plastics here are not of 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:05.730
 good quality and I listened with time and 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.810
 with time is able to act of the time he 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.050
 ends up drying out and breaking too 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.239
 so that's the extra bonus I always get 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.120
 Have a lot here, by the way. 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.970
 breaking I was going to replace more 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.430
 unfortunately 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.580
 this computer here will have to receive 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:29.140
 a new club sink and a cooler 

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:30.940
 I'm new to the right customer 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.410
 So that's it, this is the 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:37.120
 basic problem is that is when you 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:40.440
 have a computer that is doing 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.250
 this basically basically 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.700
 instantly 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:48.670
 You started the machine in 1520 seconds. 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.550
 she turns off do not insist on wanting to stay 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:54.310
 trying to start the machine 

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:56.800
 to turn off the switch Sa machine as 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.240
 club is properly if you do not have 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.620
 experience in making yourself 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.410
 forwards the machine with a 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.690
 and see the possibility of this 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:06.520
 part has the same problem as this one. 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.400
 here then here 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.709
 the replacement will connect the customer will 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.680
 pass him the problem is accepting 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.380
 I put the new piece there in the 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:21.190
 place and test to see if this 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.150
 problem there has not affected other parts 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:24.460
 from the computer 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.020
 one because the customer told me that they 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:28.390
 insisted and tried to connect to the 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.090
 machine right then this is it 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:34.450
 I'll be back to show you soon. 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:35.169
 you there if it was really that 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.510
 problem 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:40.120
 good people then where the client is 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:44.740
 I told him about the problem and the 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:48.729
 his colleague and he decided to radicalize 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:50.950
 He asked me for a cooler. It 's good that I 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:54.280
 I would have to be there for him 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.740
 the buffalo that is a cooler there that he is 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:59.020
 very good for those looking to do 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.300
 listen on the machine but for a 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.640
 so he is very good computer 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.240
 it to work with a processor 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:09.520
 original mode it gives you account of the 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:11.320
 message then there is beauty there and then 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.050
 I come back to do the tests. 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.960
 now yes, personal cooler is already 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:21.790
 installed the buffalo as I had 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.880
 commented previously and doing tests 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:29.169
 the computer did not shut down on the machine 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:29.900
 but the temperature and operating temperature 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.229
 stay in 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.870
 30 and 30 and 34 degrees 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:39.710
 there is a variation there according to the 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:44.090
 what is being made in the machine here 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:46.669
 personal eye cooler as not 

00:05:44.090 --> 00:05:49.300
 it was not bad I ended up 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:52.610
 voting for him here, behind the chance to 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.800
 auxiliary and heat exchange 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:06:00.139
 together with the processor cooler 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:06.770
 so like I said in the video the air 

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:09.229
 enter here and pass to where this 

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:14.750
 teaspoon here assists the chassis and 

00:06:09.229 --> 00:06:19.030
 in on the drive out to the the hot 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:21.860
 out of the personal cabinet then the 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:25.210
 now machine did not turn off but one 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:29.050
 A god's system works nice and 

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:32.330
 cleiton and radicalized a vienna cooler 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.849
 Relatively cool to put in the machine. 

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.250
 this machine does not see anything and that 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:39.349
 cycle will be well ball show and the 

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.669
 here's another course to do what 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:43.580
 it broke 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:46.940
 For those who do not know the drilling of 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.599
 fixing it is 80 by 80 millimeters and 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.610
 you can put the chassis of your 

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:55.039
 he is not a special club and 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.639
 do not reap normal like any other 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:57.949
 course 

00:06:55.639 --> 00:07:02.479
 so you can settle in your 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:04.280
 cabinet no problems no right 

00:07:02.479 --> 00:07:08.960
 guys then just hope this tip 

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:10.130
 It has been useful and do not let dashu 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:13.340
 he is already cool 

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:16.159
 If you liked the video, did you like it even more? 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:18.919
 favorite shares these people in their 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:22.550
 social networks that gives me a strength 

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:25.250
 cool in the channel have questions questions 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:29.650
 Leave the comments thanks guys too 

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.650
 Thank you and see you next video
