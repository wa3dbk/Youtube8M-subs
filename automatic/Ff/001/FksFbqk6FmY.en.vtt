started I want to make six layers one
for<00:00:32.369> each<00:00:32.579> body<00:00:33.300> part<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.110> I<00:00:34.410> start<00:00:35.219> by<00:00:35.430> writing

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
for each body part so I start by writing

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:44.670 
for each body part so I start by writing
names

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.010

well<00:04:07.800> a<00:04:08.660> ski<00:04:09.660> will<00:04:09.900> probably<00:04:10.470> move<00:04:10.650> the<00:04:10.920> legs

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
well a ski will probably move the legs

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:19.250 
well a ski will probably move the legs
when<00:04:11.880> he<00:04:11.910> walk<00:04:12.030> so<00:04:12.540> ah<00:04:17.299> alright<00:04:18.299> I<00:04:18.570> think<00:04:18.840> this

when he walk so ah alright I think this

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.940 
when he walk so ah alright I think this
will<00:04:19.470> work<00:04:19.850> well<00:04:20.850> this<00:04:21.150> will<00:04:21.830> pretty<00:04:22.830> much
