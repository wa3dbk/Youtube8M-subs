gonna slow it on down right now we can
see<00:01:39.079> didn't<00:01:40.079> get<00:01:40.170> an<00:01:40.259> early<00:01:40.500> game<00:01:40.590> zealot<00:01:40.979> as<00:01:41.100> I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
see didn't get an early game zealot as I

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:42.530 
see didn't get an early game zealot as I
mentioned<00:01:41.579> he<00:01:41.640> opened<00:01:41.909> up<00:01:41.939> with<00:01:42.060> two<00:01:42.299> gateways

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
mentioned he opened up with two gateways

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.960 
mentioned he opened up with two gateways
going<00:01:42.899> stalker<00:01:43.200> heavy<00:01:43.530> this<00:01:44.340> opening<00:01:44.909> is

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
going stalker heavy this opening is

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.460 
going stalker heavy this opening is
actually<00:01:45.299> pretty<00:01:45.450> solid<00:01:45.960> because<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.320> bill

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
actually pretty solid because the bill

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.170 
actually pretty solid because the bill
it<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.770> allow<00:01:46.890> you<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.189> deny<00:01:47.430> scouting<00:01:48.030> but

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
it can allow you to deny scouting but

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.429 
it can allow you to deny scouting but
also<00:01:48.299> do<00:01:48.540> a<00:01:48.570> little<00:01:48.750> bit<00:01:48.899> of<00:01:48.930> early<00:01:49.110> aggression

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
also do a little bit of early aggression

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.710 
also do a little bit of early aggression
a<00:01:49.770> lot<00:01:50.250> of<00:01:50.280> time<00:01:50.490> players<00:01:50.820> early<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.420> will<00:01:51.689> be

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
a lot of time players early on will be

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.510 
a lot of time players early on will be
sitting<00:01:52.049> marine<00:01:52.409> heavy<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.950> early<00:01:53.220> on<00:01:53.250> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
sitting marine heavy and early on the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.670 
sitting marine heavy and early on the
stalker<00:01:53.790> tis<00:01:54.090> very<00:01:54.299> well<00:01:54.540> at<00:01:54.780> softening<00:01:55.590> up

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
stalker tis very well at softening up

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.020 
stalker tis very well at softening up
the<00:01:55.710> marine<00:01:56.040> and<00:01:56.219> taking<00:01:56.549> them<00:01:56.670> out<00:01:56.790> without

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the marine and taking them out without

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.639 
the marine and taking them out without
much<00:01:57.329> issue<00:01:57.360> but<00:01:57.750> I'm<00:01:57.869> going<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.020> pause<00:01:58.229> just

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
much issue but I'm going to pause just

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.530 
much issue but I'm going to pause just
really<00:01:58.799> quickly<00:01:59.100> because<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.549> do<00:01:59.610> want<00:01:59.850> to<00:01:59.909> run

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
really quickly because I do want to run

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.300 
really quickly because I do want to run
over<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.869> billboard<00:02:01.320> order<00:02:01.710> very<00:02:01.979> quick

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
over the billboard order very quick

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.880 
over the billboard order very quick
alright<00:02:02.880> so<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> opening<00:02:03.390> was<00:02:03.509> 9<00:02:03.689> pylon<00:02:04.259> 13

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
alright so the opening was 9 pylon 13

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.429 
alright so the opening was 9 pylon 13
gateway<00:02:05.369> 16<00:02:06.030> supply<00:02:06.600> went<00:02:06.990> for<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> double

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
gateway 16 supply went for a double

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.199 
gateway 16 supply went for a double
assimilator<00:02:08.160> one<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.550> each<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.060> two

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
assimilator one on each of the two

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.809 
assimilator one on each of the two
vespene<00:02:09.629> geysers<00:02:10.080> 16<00:02:10.920> supply<00:02:11.280> was<00:02:11.459> also<00:02:11.700> that

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
vespene geysers 16 supply was also that

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.559 
vespene geysers 16 supply was also that
cybernetics<00:02:12.510> core<00:02:12.780> and<00:02:12.959> then

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
cybernetics core and then

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.899 
cybernetics core and then
18<00:02:14.290> supply<00:02:14.680> was<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.069> second<00:02:15.549> gateway<00:02:15.730> so

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
18 supply was that second gateway so

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:18.869 
18 supply was that second gateway so
started<00:02:16.480> building<00:02:17.159> started<00:02:18.159> building<00:02:18.489> some

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
started building started building some

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:20.580 
started building started building some
more<00:02:19.030> workers<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:19.659> then<00:02:19.749> 18<00:02:20.079> supply<00:02:20.349> was<00:02:20.499> the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
more workers and then 18 supply was the

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.229 
more workers and then 18 supply was the
second<00:02:20.950> gateway<00:02:21.099> now<00:02:21.730> basically<00:02:21.939> what's

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
second gateway now basically what's

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.309 
second gateway now basically what's
going<00:02:22.359> to<00:02:22.420> happen<00:02:22.689> is<00:02:22.810> as<00:02:22.959> soon<00:02:23.109> as<00:02:23.230> the

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
going to happen is as soon as the

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.379 
going to happen is as soon as the
CyberKnife<00:02:23.799> score<00:02:24.010> finishes<00:02:24.459> start<00:02:25.060> coming

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:25.389 
CyberKnife score finishes start coming

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:26.819 
CyberKnife score finishes start coming
out<00:02:25.480> with<00:02:25.719> the<00:02:25.959> stalkers<00:02:26.349> we<00:02:26.469> can<00:02:26.590> see<00:02:26.680> those

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
out with the stalkers we can see those

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:28.530 
out with the stalkers we can see those
are<00:02:26.980> being<00:02:27.129> chrono<00:02:27.340> boosted<00:02:27.670> out<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.030> also

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
are being chrono boosted out and also

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.089 
are being chrono boosted out and also
obviously<00:02:28.930> start<00:02:29.230> that<00:02:29.379> warp<00:02:29.590> gate<00:02:29.769> research

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
obviously start that warp gate research

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:32.250 
obviously start that warp gate research
the<00:02:30.579> idea<00:02:30.879> at<00:02:30.969> this<00:02:31.090> early<00:02:31.269> stage<00:02:31.659> of<00:02:32.019> the<00:02:32.139> game

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.260 
the idea at this early stage of the game

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:34.080 
the idea at this early stage of the game
is<00:02:32.530> going<00:02:32.590> to<00:02:32.859> be<00:02:32.950> map<00:02:33.219> control<00:02:33.609> use<00:02:33.909> the

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
is going to be map control use the

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.420 
is going to be map control use the
stalkers<00:02:34.540> to<00:02:34.719> deny<00:02:34.989> scouting<00:02:35.500> of<00:02:35.680> your<00:02:36.129> Terran

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
stalkers to deny scouting of your Terran

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.550 
stalkers to deny scouting of your Terran
opponent<00:02:36.879> and<00:02:37.000> then<00:02:37.420> once<00:02:37.659> you<00:02:37.780> have<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.019> few

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
opponent and then once you have a few

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.890 
opponent and then once you have a few
actually<00:02:39.400> pushing<00:02:39.790> out<00:02:39.939> with<00:02:40.150> your<00:02:40.329> force<00:02:40.599> and

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
actually pushing out with your force and

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.330 
actually pushing out with your force and
try<00:02:41.290> and<00:02:41.349> do<00:02:41.500> a<00:02:41.530> little<00:02:41.769> bit<00:02:41.889> of<00:02:41.919> aggression

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
try and do a little bit of aggression

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.679 
try and do a little bit of aggression
and<00:02:42.489> we<00:02:42.609> are<00:02:42.760> also<00:02:42.969> going<00:02:43.209> to<00:02:43.269> see<00:02:43.419> him<00:02:43.510> so<00:02:43.599> we

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:43.689 
and we are also going to see him so we

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.569 
and we are also going to see him so we
can<00:02:43.749> see<00:02:43.930> right<00:02:44.079> now<00:02:44.109> how<00:02:44.739> easy<00:02:45.099> it<00:02:45.370> is<00:02:45.519> to

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:45.579 
can see right now how easy it is to

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:47.699 
can see right now how easy it is to
actually<00:02:46.090> be<00:02:46.329> able<00:02:46.359> to<00:02:46.480> stomp<00:02:46.840> that<00:02:47.079> scout<00:02:47.500> and

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
actually be able to stomp that scout and

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.500 
actually be able to stomp that scout and
we<00:02:48.040> have<00:02:48.129> that<00:02:48.250> seconds<00:02:48.639> to<00:02:48.790> those<00:02:48.939> second

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
we have that seconds to those second

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.940 
we have that seconds to those second
faster<00:02:49.840> stalkers<00:02:50.200> coming<00:02:50.500> out<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.739> I'll<00:02:50.829> be

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
faster stalkers coming out and I'll be

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.559 
faster stalkers coming out and I'll be
able<00:02:51.010> to<00:02:51.099> take<00:02:51.280> out<00:02:51.489> this<00:02:51.879> as<00:02:52.090> well<00:02:52.239> but<00:02:52.419> he's

00:02:52.559 --> 00:02:52.569 
able to take out this as well but he's

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:53.970 
able to take out this as well but he's
not<00:02:52.719> actually<00:02:52.900> showing<00:02:53.319> and<00:02:53.530> that's<00:02:53.650> actually

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
not actually showing and that's actually

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.860 
not actually showing and that's actually
very<00:02:54.010> important<00:02:54.819> that<00:02:54.909> you<00:02:54.939> note<00:02:55.150> that<00:02:55.419> all

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
with this warp prism the biggest thing

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.300 
with this warp prism the biggest thing
that<00:05:44.320> we're<00:05:44.410> going<00:05:44.500> to<00:05:44.560> see<00:05:44.740> him<00:05:44.830> do<00:05:44.980> though<00:05:45.160> is

that we're going to see him do though is

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.940 
that we're going to see him do though is
make<00:05:45.760> proper<00:05:46.150> use<00:05:46.180> of<00:05:46.300> force<00:05:46.690> fields<00:05:47.110> and<00:05:47.230> look

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
make proper use of force fields and look

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.010 
make proper use of force fields and look
at<00:05:48.130> that<00:05:48.160> so<00:05:48.610> realize<00:05:49.060> why<00:05:49.330> this<00:05:49.390> situation

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
at that so realize why this situation

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.410 
at that so realize why this situation
