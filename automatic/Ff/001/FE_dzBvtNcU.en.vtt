00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.079
 twice I'll show you the here 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.350
 proceed by looking at these two 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:43.350
 countries 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:52.480

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.470
 it is very easy 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.450
 on the first band you draw three pearls 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:24.940
 which you then evenly on the 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:28.060
 align the band then you take that 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.080
 next band on which you now two 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.080
 beads up 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:42.140
 Add number 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:48.560
 number two in which order the 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:50.959
 beads on the tapes is pulling 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.879
 actually no matter I recommend that 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.459
 her always a steady order 

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:57.739
 between the colors or effects world 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.750
 after he raised the two pearls 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:03.470
 you also straightened them evenly 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:07.090

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:07.090
 eight countries 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:15.280

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:17.539
 Glued these in the caps 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.250

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.109
 multipurpose adhesive but you can 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:23.060
