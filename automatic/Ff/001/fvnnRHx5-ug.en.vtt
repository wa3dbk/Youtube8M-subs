the Arctic does melt badly it's gonna

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:47.469 
the Arctic does melt badly it's gonna
push<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.069> Gulf<00:01:46.280> current<00:01:46.700> and<00:01:46.880> farther<00:01:47.209> down

push the Gulf current and farther down
the<00:01:47.720> Atlantic<00:01:48.259> and<00:01:48.950> it<00:01:49.039> will<00:01:49.160> affect<00:01:49.429> this

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
the Atlantic and it will affect this

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.219 
the Atlantic and it will affect this
country<00:01:49.970> in<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:50.119> hold<00:01:50.300> of<00:01:50.420> northern<00:01:50.780> Europe<00:01:51.080> and

country in a hold of northern Europe and

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.870 
country in a hold of northern Europe and
then<00:01:51.440> if<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.649> does<00:01:51.830> start<00:01:52.069> to<00:01:52.130> snow<00:01:52.399> a<00:01:52.429> lot<00:01:52.610> I

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
then if it does start to snow a lot I

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.370 
then if it does start to snow a lot I
was<00:01:53.090> looking<00:01:53.360> forward<00:01:53.509> to<00:01:53.630> a<00:01:53.690> lot<00:01:53.840> of<00:01:53.869> skin<00:01:54.170> in

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
was looking forward to a lot of skin in

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.910 
was looking forward to a lot of skin in
the<00:01:55.369> UK<00:01:55.610> we<00:01:56.030> will<00:01:56.270> suffer<00:01:56.750> colder<00:01:57.619> weather<00:01:57.830> a

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
the UK we will suffer colder weather a

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.180 
the UK we will suffer colder weather a
longer<00:01:58.369> and<00:01:58.520> longer<00:01:58.550> period

00:01:59.180 --> 00:01:59.190 
longer and longer period
