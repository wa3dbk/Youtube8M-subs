 It's been a long time since the United States finally realized that 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:15.299
 Managers have talent but 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.829
 they do not necessarily have to brown it according to the language they write 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.449
 and there is very little use of generic books that take all twentieth century all 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:25.939
 20th century fiction 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:29.960
 iago map with her and a guide and see how fiction has gone 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.630
 enriching itself with advertising with the cinema 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.450
 with science throughout the twentieth century and therefore good was a 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.219
 need 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:40.739
 for my students the university for my sectors as a literary critic 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.850
 and the result is a kind of ambassador and his daughter in the iss but 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.250
 omar intense and very complete and I believe 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.290
 to move through the territory of the contemporary fiction of this one kafka 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.539
 the avant-garde two years 10 15 20 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:58.539
 up and sure the current fiction has added 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.660
 to 2005 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.199
 chronologies crowns that allow contextualizing each of the authors 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.730
 of each of the readings with the library proposal that at all 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.690
 pa claims to be a canon but an honest library of encouragement ask 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.110
 what big books do I really have to read 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.090
 a dull user you think I like to read from the fiction of intimacy 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.770
 opus 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.150
 by the way that is the library and some introductions that are thought not 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.340
 for the deaf only for the French ps ristas 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.690
 if not for the hidden people who are habitual readers of fiction 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.480
 and who need 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.170
 good to lean on something 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.039
 and all that is this book vii both your book with a vocation to be useful 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:42.420
 ii on 20th century finally seen in a multidisciplinary way 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.390
 I control old topics such as national theaters 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.580
 oo like the old topic also that genre fiction 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.909
