the<00:00:07.170> idea<00:00:07.439> here<00:00:07.680> is<00:00:07.710> we're<00:00:07.890> going<00:00:08.069> to<00:00:08.189> remove

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
the idea here is we're going to remove

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.850 
the idea here is we're going to remove
this<00:00:09.030> the<00:00:09.809> top<00:00:09.990> of<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.200> stump<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:10.590> make<00:00:10.740> it

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
this the top of the stump and make it

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.220 
this the top of the stump and make it
flush<00:00:11.129> with<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.430> ground<00:00:11.660> so<00:00:12.660> that's<00:00:12.870> easier

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
flush with the ground so that's easier

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.850 
flush with the ground so that's easier
for<00:00:13.260> mowing<00:00:13.639> so<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.699> start<00:00:14.940> with<00:00:15.440> we<00:00:16.440> just<00:00:16.470> dug

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
for mowing so to start with we just dug

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.460 
for mowing so to start with we just dug
out<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.279> grass<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:18.060> little<00:00:18.900> distance<00:00:19.350> away

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
out the grass a little distance away

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.550 
out the grass a little distance away
here<00:00:19.890> so<00:00:20.070> we<00:00:20.160> can<00:00:20.279> work<00:00:20.310> on<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> stump<00:00:20.970> and<00:00:21.560> I

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
here so we can work on the stump and I

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.320 
here so we can work on the stump and I
don't<00:00:23.340> have<00:00:23.550> different<00:00:23.760> Alice<00:00:23.970> to<00:00:24.060> show<00:00:24.240> you

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
don't have different Alice to show you

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.330 
don't have different Alice to show you
I'm<00:00:24.420> going<00:00:24.450> to<00:00:24.600> mark<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:24.990> stump<00:00:25.320> so<00:00:26.220> what

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
I'm going to mark this stump so what

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.760 
I'm going to mark this stump so what
I've<00:00:26.430> done<00:00:26.580> here<00:00:26.640> let's<00:00:27.180> look<00:00:28.140> at<00:00:28.260> a<00:00:28.289> sharpie

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
I've done here let's look at a sharpie

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.250 
I've done here let's look at a sharpie
wrap<00:00:29.190> some<00:00:29.400> masking<00:00:29.850> tape<00:00:30.030> around<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.420> fit<00:00:31.140> it

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
wrap some masking tape around it fit it

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.970 
wrap some masking tape around it fit it
inside<00:00:31.410> this<00:00:31.800> old<00:00:32.039> tent<00:00:32.279> stake<00:00:32.610> or<00:00:32.910> tent<00:00:33.510> pole

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
inside this old tent stake or tent pole

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.959 
inside this old tent stake or tent pole
and<00:00:34.980> then<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.129> can<00:00:35.250> just<00:00:35.399> go<00:00:35.489> along<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.820> ground

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
and then we can just go along the ground

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.350 
and then we can just go along the ground
like<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.449> a<00:00:37.699> flush

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.350 

so<00:00:42.290> we<00:00:42.410> have<00:00:42.530> a<00:00:42.560> nicer<00:00:42.770> line<00:00:43.070> to<00:00:43.220> cut

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
so we have a nicer line to cut

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.060 
so we have a nicer line to cut
keeping<00:00:46.020> this<00:00:46.140> on<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.470> ground<00:00:46.710> of<00:00:46.890> course

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
keeping this on the ground of course

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.100 
keeping this on the ground of course
you've<00:00:47.820> got<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:48.000> line<00:00:48.210> run<00:00:48.480> around<00:00:48.630> all<00:00:48.990> the<00:00:49.080> way

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
you've got a line run around all the way

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.140 
you've got a line run around all the way
around<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.620> now<00:00:49.740> but<00:00:50.520> what<00:00:50.790> I<00:00:50.850> think<00:00:51.000> I'm<00:00:51.060> going

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.150
