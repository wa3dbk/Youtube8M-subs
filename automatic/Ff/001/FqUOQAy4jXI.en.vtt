drop the backpack as well like the
zombies<00:00:36.540> used<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.950> so<00:00:37.950> that's<00:00:38.100> pretty<00:00:38.309> nice

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
zombies used to so that's pretty nice

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.209 
zombies used to so that's pretty nice
they<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.140> so<00:00:40.379> much<00:00:40.500> more<00:00:40.739> help<00:00:40.950> from<00:00:41.070> the

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
they have so much more help from the

they have so much more help from the
zombies<00:00:41.610> it<00:00:41.700> seems<00:00:44.570> ok<00:00:45.570> before<00:00:45.750> arrows<00:00:46.200> old

one shot zombies that Lisa wolves get
two<00:00:50.160> shots<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:58.500> Bears<00:00:58.739> seem<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.250> regular

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
two shots the Bears seem like regular

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:10.670 
two shots the Bears seem like regular
bears<00:01:01.309> you<00:01:02.309> head<00:01:02.850> shot<00:01:03.090> done<00:01:09.530> alright<00:01:10.530> so

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
bears you head shot done alright so

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.039 
bears you head shot done alright so
here's<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.159> new<00:01:11.310> metal<00:01:12.350> resource<00:01:14.900> let's<00:01:15.900> see

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
here's the new metal resource let's see

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.149 
here's the new metal resource let's see
what<00:01:16.140> this<00:01:16.259> looks<00:01:16.320> like<00:01:16.590> when<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.890> break<00:01:17.130> it

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
what this looks like when you break it

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:22.670 
what this looks like when you break it
down<00:01:20.960> so<00:01:21.960> it's<00:01:22.049> pretty<00:01:22.200> much<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> same

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
down so it's pretty much the same

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.450 
down so it's pretty much the same
graphic<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.369> the<00:01:23.549> solver<00:01:25.009> whole<00:01:26.009> animation

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
graphic as the solver whole animation

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.030 
graphic as the solver whole animation
release

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:31.040 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:46.730 

and<00:01:32.040> then<00:01:32.160> here's<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.490> new<00:01:32.700> wood<00:01:32.970> piles<00:01:45.740> they

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
and then here's the new wood piles they

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.560 
and then here's the new wood piles they
seem<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:46.980> have<00:01:47.190> more<00:01:47.370> stages<00:01:47.760> than<00:01:50.540> why<00:01:51.540> I

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
seem to have more stages than why I

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.170 
seem to have more stages than why I
guess<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.870> should<00:01:52.020> counter<00:01:52.850> that's<00:01:53.850> pretty

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
guess I should counter that's pretty

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:16.750 
guess I should counter that's pretty
neat<00:02:14.690> alright<00:02:15.690> so<00:02:15.840> let's<00:02:15.990> test<00:02:16.230> out<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.500> new

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
neat alright so let's test out the new

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.920 
neat alright so let's test out the new
speed<00:02:17.760> of<00:02:17.910> the<00:02:18.060> workbench<00:02:18.709> so<00:02:19.709> let's<00:02:19.920> see

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
speed of the workbench so let's see

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.199 
speed of the workbench so let's see
wooden<00:02:21.930> shelter<00:02:22.560> to<00:02:23.280> make<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.459> wooden<00:02:23.700> shelter

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
wooden shelter to make a wooden shelter

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.530 
wooden shelter to make a wooden shelter
it<00:02:24.330> takes<00:02:24.540> 30<00:02:24.930> seconds<00:02:25.440> and<00:02:26.270> then<00:02:27.270> when<00:02:27.510> i

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
it takes 30 seconds and then when i

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.580 
it takes 30 seconds and then when i
place<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.930> workbench<00:02:28.320> down<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:31.140> get<00:02:31.290> buff

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
place the workbench down you get buff

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.520 
place the workbench down you get buff
says<00:02:31.860> you've<00:02:32.100> near<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.459> workbench<00:02:33.380> it<00:02:34.380> only

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
says you've near the workbench it only

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.729 
says you've near the workbench it only
takes<00:02:34.770> 10<00:02:35.760> seconds<00:02:37.580> that's<00:02:38.580> pretty<00:02:38.850> nice<00:02:39.739> so

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
takes 10 seconds that's pretty nice so

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:47.270 
takes 10 seconds that's pretty nice so
the<00:02:40.830> sleeping<00:02:41.250> bag<00:02:41.459> takes<00:02:42.239> 10<00:02:42.510> seconds<00:02:46.160> one<00:02:47.160> or

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
the sleeping bag takes 10 seconds one or

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.420 
the sleeping bag takes 10 seconds one or
my<00:02:47.430> takes<00:02:47.670> 30<00:02:48.290> so<00:02:49.290> three<00:02:49.709> times<00:02:49.920> as<00:02:50.160> fast<00:02:52.430> what

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
my takes 30 so three times as fast what

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:58.699 
my takes 30 so three times as fast what
else<00:02:53.580> can<00:02:53.760> we<00:02:53.910> test<00:02:54.120> out<00:02:54.420> oh<00:02:57.050> wow<00:02:58.050> loger<00:02:58.620> it

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
else can we test out oh wow loger it

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.750 
else can we test out oh wow loger it
feels<00:02:59.010> like<00:02:59.190> instant

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:11.350

all right large rooms let's see which
day<00:03:11.510> it<00:03:11.780> takes<00:03:11.930> seven<00:03:12.320> seconds<00:03:13.480> what's<00:03:14.480> it

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
day it takes seven seconds what's it

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.530 
day it takes seven seconds what's it
without<00:03:14.780> how<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.470> need<00:03:15.740> a<00:03:15.770> workbench<00:03:16.540> all

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
without how you need a workbench all

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:34.650 
without how you need a workbench all
right<00:03:27.670> let's<00:03:28.670> see<00:03:28.820> cloth<00:03:29.180> here<00:03:29.890> 10<00:03:30.890> seconds<00:03:33.550> 30

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
right let's see cloth here 10 seconds 30

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.800 
right let's see cloth here 10 seconds 30
all<00:03:35.660> right<00:03:35.900> that's<00:03:36.470> pretty<00:03:36.770> nice<00:03:40.690> so<00:03:41.690> the

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
all right that's pretty nice so the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.390 
all right that's pretty nice so the
workbench<00:03:42.200> makes<00:03:42.740> you<00:03:42.860> cry<00:03:43.010> from<00:03:43.160> time

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
workbench makes you cry from time

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:55.990 
workbench makes you cry from time
increase<00:03:43.940> by<00:03:44.810> three<00:03:45.230> times<00:03:45.440> as<00:03:45.590> fast<00:03:54.790> then<00:03:55.790> to

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
increase by three times as fast then to

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.480 
increase by three times as fast then to
make<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.150> handmade<00:03:56.660> lock<00:03:57.020> pick<00:03:57.320> it<00:03:57.800> takes<00:03:58.070> eight

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:58.490 
make a handmade lock pick it takes eight

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:02.290 
make a handmade lock pick it takes eight
low<00:03:58.910> quality<00:03:59.180> metal<00:03:59.660> and<00:04:00.020> five<00:04:00.740> cloth<00:04:01.300> and

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
low quality metal and five cloth and

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.390 
low quality metal and five cloth and
then<00:04:02.450> you<00:04:02.540> could<00:04:02.660> use<00:04:02.900> this<00:04:03.110> to<00:04:03.350> loot<00:04:03.830> people's

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
then you could use this to loot people's

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.920 
then you could use this to loot people's
backpacks<00:04:05.060> when<00:04:05.870> they<00:04:05.990> self<00:04:06.230> password<00:04:06.770> on<00:04:06.890> it
