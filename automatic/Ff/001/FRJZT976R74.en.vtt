what I always say is that when you shoot

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:39.889 
what I always say is that when you shoot
a<00:01:37.840> woman<00:01:38.170> and<00:01:38.319> you're<00:01:38.560> a<00:01:38.590> woman<00:01:39.130> and<00:01:39.250> you<00:01:39.460> have

a woman and you're a woman and you have

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.169 
a woman and you're a woman and you have
a<00:01:40.899> different<00:01:41.440> outlook<00:01:41.830> on<00:01:42.399> femininity<00:01:43.060> and

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
a different outlook on femininity and

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.149
