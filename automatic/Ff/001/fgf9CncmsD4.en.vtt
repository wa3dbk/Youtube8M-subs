00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.060 
targets now I'm this team is going to be
very<00:00:15.389> heavily<00:00:16.139> reliant<00:00:16.529> on<00:00:16.680> whether<00:00:16.920> or<00:00:17.010> not

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
very heavily reliant on whether or not

very heavily reliant on whether or not
bail<00:00:17.369> stays<00:00:17.760> if<00:00:17.970> he<00:00:18.390> goes<00:00:18.570> I<00:00:18.840> think<00:00:19.050> it<00:00:19.140> will<00:00:19.199> be

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
bail stays if he goes I think it will be

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.840 
bail stays if he goes I think it will be
completely<00:00:19.710> different<00:00:20.010> than<00:00:20.279> strengthen<00:00:20.760> in

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
completely different than strengthen in

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.070 
completely different than strengthen in
different<00:00:21.150> areas<00:00:21.449> they'll<00:00:21.600> have<00:00:21.689> more<00:00:21.869> money

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
different areas they'll have more money

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.310 
different areas they'll have more money
to<00:00:22.199> spend<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.710> all<00:00:23.189> that<00:00:23.369> good<00:00:23.550> stuff<00:00:23.609> but

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
to spend and all that good stuff but

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.689 
to spend and all that good stuff but
this<00:00:25.320> in<00:00:25.529> my<00:00:25.680> opinion<00:00:25.980> could<00:00:26.250> be<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.519> team

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
this in my opinion could be the team

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.519 
this in my opinion could be the team
they'll<00:00:26.880> be<00:00:26.970> using<00:00:27.000> next<00:00:27.510> season<00:00:27.779> if<00:00:27.930> they

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529

in I did go for Dawson in the end I kind

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:31.750 
in I did go for Dawson in the end I kind
of<00:02:30.410> get<00:02:30.530> the<00:02:30.560> feeling<00:02:30.800> that<00:02:30.920> he<00:02:31.070> will<00:02:31.370> still<00:02:31.610> be

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
of get the feeling that he will still be

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:32.950 
of get the feeling that he will still be
partnering<00:02:32.120> for<00:02:32.210> tongue<00:02:32.450> and<00:02:32.600> when<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.840> two

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
partnering for tongue and when the two

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.090 
partnering for tongue and when the two
have<00:02:33.080> played<00:02:33.290> together<00:02:33.440> they've<00:02:33.800> been<00:02:33.950> pretty

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100

solid<00:02:34.400> at<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.700> back<00:02:34.880> and<00:02:35.320> yeah<00:02:36.320> I<00:02:36.350> think<00:02:36.710> it'll

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
solid at the back and yeah I think it'll

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:38.710 
solid at the back and yeah I think it'll
be<00:02:37.220> him<00:02:37.400> that<00:02:37.610> plays<00:02:37.820> there<00:02:38.090> next<00:02:38.420> season

season<00:02:42.650> if<00:02:43.010> I'm<00:02:43.190> correct<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.820> was<00:02:44.240> looking<00:02:44.540> at

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.750 
season if I'm correct I was looking at
some<00:02:44.750> stats<00:02:45.020> and<00:02:45.230> stuff<00:02:45.350> and<00:02:45.530> obviously<00:02:46.490> I

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:46.760 
some stats and stuff and obviously I

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.310 
some stats and stuff and obviously I
can't<00:02:47.060> see<00:02:47.180> any<00:02:47.330> reason<00:02:47.480> for<00:02:47.660> him<00:02:47.870> not<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:48.140> be

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
can't see any reason for him not to be

quite as good to the previous season but
he's<00:02:52.430> still<00:02:52.640> been<00:02:52.790> a<00:02:52.850> very<00:02:53.150> very<00:02:53.240> solid<00:02:53.990> right

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
he's still been a very very solid right

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.090 
he's still been a very very solid right
back<00:02:54.850> over<00:02:55.850> into<00:02:56.000> left<00:02:56.420> mid<00:02:56.600> and<00:02:56.810> we<00:02:57.110> have<00:02:57.320> not

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
back over into left mid and we have not

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.710 
back over into left mid and we have not
the<00:02:58.250> one<00:02:58.370> you<00:02:58.490> think<00:02:58.640> is<00:02:58.790> to<00:02:59.030> start<00:02:59.300> with<00:02:59.540> and

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
the one you think is to start with and

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.050 
the one you think is to start with and
it<00:02:59.810> is<00:02:59.900> Dempsey<00:03:00.470> Clint<00:03:00.800> Dempsey<00:03:01.190> he<00:03:01.820> has<00:03:01.910> been

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
it is Dempsey Clint Dempsey he has been

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.220 
it is Dempsey Clint Dempsey he has been
very<00:03:02.240> good<00:03:02.390> for<00:03:02.540> them<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:02.780> year<00:03:02.840> as<00:03:03.110> well

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
very good for them this year as well

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.590 
very good for them this year as well
played<00:03:03.500> quite<00:03:03.800> a<00:03:03.860> few<00:03:04.160> games<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.880> can't<00:03:05.360> see<00:03:05.480> any

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
played quite a few games I can't see any

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.000 
played quite a few games I can't see any
reason<00:03:05.780> for<00:03:05.959> him<00:03:06.140> not<00:03:06.170> to<00:03:06.380> be<00:03:06.530> Eva<00:03:06.770> on<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:06.950> left

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
reason for him not to be Eva on the left

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.190 
reason for him not to be Eva on the left
or<00:03:07.370> just<00:03:07.640> inside<00:03:07.820> maybe<00:03:08.270> rotating<00:03:08.870> with<00:03:08.990> bail

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
or just inside maybe rotating with bail

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:11.199 
or just inside maybe rotating with bail
I'm<00:03:09.740> pretty<00:03:10.010> sure<00:03:10.160> he<00:03:10.340> will<00:03:10.550> be<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:10.910> the<00:03:11.000> squad

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
I'm pretty sure he will be in the squad

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.140 
I'm pretty sure he will be in the squad
next<00:03:12.170> up<00:03:12.320> we<00:03:12.590> have<00:03:12.620> where<00:03:13.250> is<00:03:13.370> he<00:03:13.490> we<00:03:13.790> have<00:03:13.940> 0

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
it seems like it's almost done like soon

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.210 
it seems like it's almost done like soon
as<00:03:35.510> the<00:03:35.600> confederations<00:03:36.230> cup<00:03:36.290> is<00:03:36.620> over<00:03:36.890> it

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.009 
next season and not a lot else to say
about<00:03:50.450> that<00:03:50.870> really<00:03:51.580> into<00:03:52.580> left<00:03:53.209> well<00:03:53.600> left

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
about that really into left well left

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:55.570 
about that really into left well left
attacking<00:03:54.500> midfield<00:03:54.830> really<00:03:55.100> and<00:03:55.250> I've<00:03:55.340> gone

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
attacking midfield really and I've gone

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.729 
attacking midfield really and I've gone
40<00:03:56.120> not<00:03:56.510> Cristiano<00:03:56.989> Ronaldo<00:03:57.380> they'd<00:03:57.560> love

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
40 not Cristiano Ronaldo they'd love

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:00.130 
40 not Cristiano Ronaldo they'd love
that<00:03:57.799> but<00:03:58.580> oh<00:03:58.880> I'm<00:03:59.360> messing<00:03:59.690> it<00:03:59.750> up<00:03:59.780> still

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.140 
that but oh I'm messing it up still

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:02.620 
that but oh I'm messing it up still
they've<00:04:00.350> gone<00:04:00.590> for<00:04:01.070> obviously<00:04:01.580> Gareth<00:04:02.360> Bale

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
they've gone for obviously Gareth Bale

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.140 
they've gone for obviously Gareth Bale
because<00:04:03.110> I<00:04:03.140> can't<00:04:03.620> see<00:04:03.739> any<00:04:03.890> reason<00:04:04.100> for<00:04:04.400> well

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
because I can't see any reason for well

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.750 
because I can't see any reason for well
I<00:04:05.420> say<00:04:05.959> that<00:04:06.200> this<00:04:06.709> is<00:04:06.769> heavily<00:04:07.190> dependent<00:04:07.370> on

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:07.760 
I say that this is heavily dependent on

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:09.759 
I say that this is heavily dependent on
whether<00:04:08.000> or<00:04:08.060> not<00:04:08.209> he<00:04:08.360> stays<00:04:08.600> if<00:04:08.840> he<00:04:08.959> goes<00:04:09.200> this

00:04:09.759 --> 00:04:09.769 
whether or not he stays if he goes this

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:11.380 
whether or not he stays if he goes this
will<00:04:09.950> be<00:04:10.040> completely<00:04:10.400> different<00:04:10.640> obviously

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
will be completely different obviously

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:12.400 
will be completely different obviously
the<00:04:11.510> whole<00:04:11.690> team<00:04:11.900> will<00:04:12.049> be<00:04:12.140> shaped

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
the whole team will be shaped

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:14.140 
the whole team will be shaped
differently<00:04:12.560> they'll<00:04:12.950> have<00:04:13.100> a<00:04:13.130> new<00:04:13.400> central

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
differently they'll have a new central

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.699 
differently they'll have a new central
man<00:04:14.299> they'll<00:04:14.630> focus<00:04:14.900> all<00:04:15.200> their<00:04:15.290> play<00:04:15.500> around

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
man they'll focus all their play around

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.830 
man they'll focus all their play around
but<00:04:15.980> if<00:04:16.220> he<00:04:16.459> does<00:04:16.669> stay<00:04:16.910> he'll<00:04:17.450> play<00:04:17.630> a<00:04:17.660> more

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
but if he does stay he'll play a more

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.930 
but if he does stay he'll play a more
central<00:04:18.260> role<00:04:18.290> next<00:04:18.560> season<00:04:19.010> but<00:04:19.040> like<00:04:19.700> that

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
central role next season but like that

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.000 
central role next season but like that
central<00:04:20.419> attacking<00:04:20.630> mid<00:04:20.959> there<00:04:21.200> on<00:04:21.349> the<00:04:21.770> left

central attacking mid there on the left

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.159 
central attacking mid there on the left
side<00:04:22.310> of<00:04:22.580> it<00:04:22.729> and<00:04:22.910> that<00:04:22.940> he'll<00:04:23.479> be<00:04:23.660> incredible

side of it and that he'll be incredible

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:26.290
