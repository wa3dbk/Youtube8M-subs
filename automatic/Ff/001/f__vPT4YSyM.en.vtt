 Are you a non-vegan with questions about veganism? Are you a vegan and unsure how to ask 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.049
 of people have to answer? Do you want to answer vegan but refuse to read books that 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:15.030
 don't have nice pictures? Are you rather cheap? Then I have the book for you! 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.840
 Hi, here Emily from Bite Size Vegan and welcome to a new 'vegan nugget'! I want some time 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.449
 to tell you some exciting news - my free ebook is finally out! It is called 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:33.449
 Vegan Answers to Common Questions and Objections. (I can't really see it here, you know ... 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.890
 I pretend for you). Anyway, I wrote this book as a simple help for the many 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.800
 questions and concerns people have about veganism. I'm talking about questions like why are vegan 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.720
 and not vegetarian, how do vegans get protein, calcium, iron, B12? Isn't becoming a vegan difficult? 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.460
 Is it not expensive? And more! Plus it has nice colors and pictures! It's so nice, 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.360
 you don't even realize you're learning! And the best of the book?
