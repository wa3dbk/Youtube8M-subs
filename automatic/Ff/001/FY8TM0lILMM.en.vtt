00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.160
 good evening to all and graphics 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.990
 dozen 87 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.090
 we meet tonight for a 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:39.260
 eighth tutorials and I hope you 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.750
 simplify a little bit of life in 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.760
 4d cinema mainly to create 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.630
 logos therefore already exist for example 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.890
 in vector or directly in images 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:52.070
 so as you can find out in 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.690
 cinema 4d we have course tools from 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.950
 beziers etc but they are not great 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.930
 simple to use to reproduce 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.040
 directly the image so the simplest 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.270
 often for those who are used to 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.340
 it went through software 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.650
 conventional like photoshop or 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:06.560
 illustrator so software that can 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.720
 provide you with electoral traces so 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.640
 I chose to reproduce the logo of 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.560
 assassin's creed so simply 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:18.380
 I imported an image under photoshop and 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.750
 then I have laps and so the logo 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:25.130
 with the tool plus a little bit like 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.800
 these are these kinds of things that 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.170
 you make the whole plot both 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.240
 parts is you take your logo so 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.960
 then simply do you 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.090
 green trace export files 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:41.120
 illustrator there you choose your 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.930
 contract this is there once you are 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:46.850
 there you save it so that their 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.490
 registered mark thus had a size 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.770
 illustrator then so you go 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:56.450
 in junior cinema where the ag have already created 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:02:00.850
 a scene so you prepare your scene 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:03.470
 then you make media window 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.270
 so here I am in my media library and 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:07.580
 there for example I have my path that is 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.100
 here is what I'm going to do is that 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.810
 I am going to merge factor 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.320
 of scale a flight guard and we'll see what 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.140
 that gives 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.799
 and there you can see that my path 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:22.130
 done under photoshop appeared 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:25.070
 directly here so here I have both 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.600
 parts and maintenance that remains to 

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.820
 to do is that now you are 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.989
 traces in spleen is so everything 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.709
 simply want to apply the 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.610
 different things 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:38.799
 so I'm going to duplicate the extrusion 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.799
 and I'm going to put both tracks in 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.060
 and that's just so I'm going 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:52.920
 finish logo to show you what that 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:54.840
 gives and so you really see that 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.060
 the interest is to facilitate the task 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.220
 is to save time mainly 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.489
 because we do not always have the time to 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.959
 to make a leap from the towers to day is 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.989
 good it always takes less time to 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:12.600
 have fun doing the form directly 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:16.100
 in 4d cinema not what I'm going to do 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.100
 it's reduced a little bit in size 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.489
 ladder 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:46.520
 but I can reduce it again a little 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:49.730
 very few even that's it that's me 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:54.470
 already seems much better so you 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:59.170
 do this what am I going to do what 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.170
 I like in place and won more cameras 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.220
 there is a little bit like that we're going to 

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.220
 earn a little more 05 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.900
 so here is then you create a 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:21.090
 material so I have already worried the 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.960
 sas and the bottom so I'm going to make it a 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:32.250
 new one so I'm going to put it in 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:33.150
 white I could apply a reflection on 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.390
 will look a little what it gives 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.390
 quickly 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:47.040
 here we have a logo of assassin's creed 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.680
 and you can make your own 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.020
 logo like this I hope this little 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.730
