00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:10.560
 I would like to attach a scoop to the figure 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:15.360
 It is a scope of any sound, but it is a process to make this hang here 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:17.120
 The suburbs are becoming sticky and rice fields are becoming. If you just put here 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.500

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.410
 Say this 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:28.439
 It is a now room in the same way as 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:32.240
 I'm stuck on this part of the belt 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:36.200
 Well , I want to attach it to the end of here 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:41.480
 I think there are various materials to put a loop though 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:49.329
 I would like to make that one with this king tape this time 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:52.920

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.920
 Garage masking tape 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.600
 Bridge of this much

 Well, when I turn over this adhesive side 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.870
 There in the 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.590
 This 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.560
 Cut out the same length 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.500
 th 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:30.630
 We start to hear a ridge 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:30.630
 Bond the bonding sides of each sound bonding side together 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.540
 There was 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.850
 Raise 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:43.810
 Something like this 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:47.330

 I cut it thin and attach this 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.030
 The back of this scoop is also a little scooped and it's curved 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:20.280
 Since we want to sell close contact in gouge and then to a second 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.660
 Kito length of the rim tape 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.500

 Stop with 8 instant glue 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.550
