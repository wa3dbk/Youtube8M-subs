00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 while the devices of the n series htcs 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.150
 upper class should cover new this 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.730
 Models stir up the middle class 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.160
 this includes the desire 610 with quadcore 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.620
 processor and 4 7 inch display the for 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:27.119
 just under 300 euros in the sale goes something 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:28.769
 it can tell you in the test the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.240
 front reminds with the above 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.859
 and attached below the display 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.809
 and stereo speakers and the 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.329
 black performance with htc logo on dibon 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.950
 series at the back hear the 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.570
 similarities to them, however 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.010
 equipped with plastic and plan 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.920
 while in the case of smartphones 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.059
 curved aluminum is used 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.640
 Nevertheless, there is the processing of the 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.739
 desire 610 nothing to complain about 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.780
 all components work together cleanly 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.699
 above and in total makes the device one 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.500
 robust impression 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.180
 The backside is smooth though 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.879
 but not slippery to the roughened 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.280
 pages make the device even more handy 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.409
 in relation to the 47 inch display falls 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.060
 The housing is very large from here to 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.320
 compare google nexus 4 with that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.510
 Equipped with a display of the same size 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.549
 Overall, however, is essential 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.750
 more compact therefore comes the largest 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.409
 complicates the operation with one hand 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.530
 substantially 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:19.170
 the display itself solves with 540 x 960 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.330
 Pixelate on that is a bit disappointing 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.650
 the middle class is likely at 4.7 inches 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.049
 already hd 720 x 1280 pixels in it 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.610
 this is how individual pixels become in particular 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.210
 with smaller symbols and writings 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.040
 visible 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.990
 Overall, with the resolution 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.780
 live well but it works too 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.189
 better color representation and brightness 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.860
 the display are in order 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.570
 Of course, colors are likely to work 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.900
 like something brighter and intense 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.910
 are displayed 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.260
 as far as the speed of work is concerned 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.770
 the smartphone leaves a good mark 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.230
 impression 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.030
 although he only belongs to 1 2 gigahertz 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.980
 clocked quad-core processor not too 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.480
 the fastest in the operation goes 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.010
 however, everything is fluid and fast from the 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.780
 hand 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.920
 hertz states fast games run without 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.920
 jerk what you want more 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.440
 The internal memory is 8 gigabytes in size 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.060
 more than half of them are from 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.950
 System files taken so that the 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.050
 users only about 3 8 gigabytes 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.230
 stay who needs more memory 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.799
 can this by micro sd card up to 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.239
 Expand 128gb 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.920
 the camera delivers pictures with up to 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.140
 eight megapixels and they look pretty 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.879
 especially good in contrast and contrast 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.470
 Dynamics can convince you, too 

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.030
 it comes here and there to color noise 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.030
 the camera delivers nice pictures 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.379
 less convincing are the 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.150
 stereo speakers on the front 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.190
 like the towering loudspeaker of the 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.830
 Although they have the bonner power over the 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:51.810
 so-called and technology they sound 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.340
 but much worse the 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.140
 sound is quite alright for a smartphone 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.360
 good and the stereo factor affects 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.459
 Positive from who but the voluminous 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.610
 sound of the one series is expected 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.610
 disappointed 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:10.829
 the htc desire 610 comes to one 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.000
 recommended retail price of 299 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:14.069
 euro in the trade 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.200
 the street price should be a bit lower 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.940
 lie for the buyer gets a good 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.440
 equipped mid-range smartphone 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.840
 that does not weaken any noticeable ones 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.760
 does not render the display resolution 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.890
 quite as high as it is not that dramatic 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.310
 The housing is very large 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.260
 out at this point should be noted 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.000
 that the housing is big htc 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.040
 but with the sim card in the place saves 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.959
 so instead of a micro sim a must 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.519
 slightly smaller awo sim card 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:40.409
 be used for many users 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.000
 does that mean they are either from 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.069
 need to disconnect your old sim card 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.400
 or at its own risk manage 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.400
 support
