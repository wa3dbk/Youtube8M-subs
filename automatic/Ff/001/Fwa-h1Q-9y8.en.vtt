the proper the q3 product we're
introducing<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.590> couple<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:49.950> new<00:00:50.039> things<00:00:50.070> one

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
introducing a couple of new things one

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.720 
introducing a couple of new things one
of<00:00:50.910> them<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.149> a<00:00:51.510> SATA<00:00:51.960> nice<00:00:52.829> combination<00:00:53.550> a

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
of them is a SATA nice combination a

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.209 
of them is a SATA nice combination a
SATA<00:00:54.000> USB<00:00:54.300> port<00:00:54.960> so<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.289> get<00:00:55.649> transfer<00:00:56.070> rate

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
SATA USB port so you get transfer rate

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.740 
SATA USB port so you get transfer rate
on<00:00:56.370> five<00:00:56.579> times<00:00:56.789> faster<00:00:57.210> it's<00:00:57.360> great<00:00:57.570> for

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
on five times faster it's great for

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.470 
on five times faster it's great for
external<00:00:58.140> hard<00:00:58.440> drives<00:00:58.789> other<00:00:59.789> things<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.420> a

external hard drives other things is a

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.119 
external hard drives other things is a
pin<00:01:01.140> tuna<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:02.010> feel<00:01:02.820> use<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> FM<00:01:03.510> tuner<00:01:04.129> radio

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
pin tuna so feel use a FM tuner radio
