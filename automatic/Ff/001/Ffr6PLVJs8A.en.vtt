00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.480
 from the moment it is lit 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.859
 that is, police services 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.150

 micro is where a mobile phone 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.960
 becomes a micron it's well understood 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.529
 it's not a problem 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.240
 technically it's very easy to do

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.550
 new best friends the famous ones 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.860
 smartphones 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.300
 not so obvious if you believe two 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.370
 recent demonstrations by 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.809
 pirates in the united states actually the

 most phones connected to the internet 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.829

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.300
 their owners it would seem that 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.920
 the data the conversations the

 messages can be hijacked with a 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.879
 disconcerting ease match to 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.660

 american viewers michael 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.690
 greg is an expert in hacking 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.640
 data processing 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.530

 personal like codes for example 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.040
 the specialist finally decides to go 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.720
 listen to voicemail messages 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.009
 of this passerby taken at random 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.210
 the young woman is stunned yesterday 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.190
 today the multimedia notebooks ap 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.899
 smartphones are on the rise 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.550
 it sold 55 million in the 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.179
 world this year but unlike 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.280
 what is believed 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.210
 a smartphone is not simply connected 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.610
 internet 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.259
 these are all smartphones owned 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.940
 to the same operator who are networked 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.319
 between them in France for example a 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.459
 portable island communicates in 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.709
 permanence with another in marseille 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.390
 even if their interlocutors do not 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.130
 do not know and it's this broad group 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.200
 mobile phone that is then connected to the 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.760
 global internet network in the suburbs 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.280
 from washington very low on the turn 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.600
 another expert in computer security 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.100
 sounds the alarm bell 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.720
 smartphones also allow track 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.440
 is very easily the position of their 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.930
 users 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.820
 example with this unknown that trevor has 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.900
 identified on an online game of his 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.670
 simple office 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.380
 the expert will be able to reconstitute all 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.829
 journeys made by this person 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.480
 during the last 30 days 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.220
 the laptop is the most 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:41.519
 staff that every one of us 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.110
 are 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.790
 people have it all the time with them and 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:45.989
 we can track people 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.510
 are worried that the government 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.950
 prefer to track me citizens I 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.510
 say that they should be concerned about this 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.489
 that commercial companies can 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.109
 do with this information to get 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.420
 protect the specialists give three 

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:58.320
 advice first do not crack his 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.549
 cellphone 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.320
 by changing the operator or 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.900
 downloading illegal software 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:04.859
 then do not open e-mails or 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.290
 unknown sites 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:11.510
 finally pay attention to online games 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.510
 especially those at which your children play
