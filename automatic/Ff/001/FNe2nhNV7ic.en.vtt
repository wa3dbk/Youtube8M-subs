thousand dollars instead of five
thousand<00:00:55.770> dollars<00:00:56.160> you<00:00:56.699> won't<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:57.059> able<00:00:57.149> to

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
thousand dollars you won't be able to

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.930 
thousand dollars you won't be able to
manifest<00:01:00.680> the<00:01:01.680> moment<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.370> are<00:01:02.399> able<00:01:02.730> to

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
manifest the moment you are able to

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.690 
manifest the moment you are able to
conceive<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:04.110> you<00:01:04.320> can<00:01:04.650> make<00:01:04.920> ten<00:01:05.189> thousand

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
conceive that you can make ten thousand

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.410 
conceive that you can make ten thousand
a<00:01:05.790> month<00:01:07.220> then<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.250> will<00:01:08.729> be<00:01:09.090> able<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.630> make<00:01:09.810> it

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
a month then you will be able to make it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.660 
a month then you will be able to make it
so<00:01:12.420> why<00:01:12.689> are<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.500> not<00:01:13.979> able<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.580> conceive<00:01:14.970> I

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
so why are you not able to conceive I

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.539 
so why are you not able to conceive I
think<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:17.970> a<00:01:18.000> question<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:18.479> everybody

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
think this is a question that everybody

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.109 
think this is a question that everybody
has<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.580> ask<00:01:21.890> himself<00:01:22.890> or<00:01:23.310> herself<00:01:23.460> at

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
has to ask himself or herself at

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.100 
has to ask himself or herself at
different<00:01:24.930> levels<00:01:25.909> the<00:01:26.909> millionaire<00:01:27.450> can<00:01:27.720> ask

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
different levels the millionaire can ask

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.230 
different levels the millionaire can ask
the<00:01:28.500> same<00:01:28.710> question<00:01:29.189> why<00:01:29.400> I<00:01:29.430> am<00:01:29.759> NOT<00:01:30.210> a

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the same question why I am NOT a

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.230 
the same question why I am NOT a
billionaire<00:01:30.990> why<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.860> am<00:01:32.130> NOT<00:01:32.490> able<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:35.210> make<00:01:36.210> a

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
billionaire why I am NOT able to make a

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.780 
billionaire why I am NOT able to make a
billion<00:01:36.659> dollar<00:01:38.329> it<00:01:39.329> is<00:01:39.540> because<00:01:40.250> there<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
billion dollar it is because there is a

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.530 
billion dollar it is because there is a
problem<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.140> conception<00:01:44.119> there<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.329> a

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
problem in conception there is a

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:51.319 
problem in conception there is a
conceptual<00:01:47.720> constraint<00:01:50.030> where<00:01:51.030> does<00:01:51.180> the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
conceptual constraint where does the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.289 
conceptual constraint where does the
constraint<00:01:51.840> come<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.700> how<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.939> we<00:01:54.119> help

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
constraint come from and how can we help

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.289 
constraint come from and how can we help
it

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
it

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.609 
it
the<00:01:55.930> constraint<00:01:56.530> comes<00:01:56.920> from<00:01:57.579> a<00:01:58.619> certain

00:01:59.609 --> 00:01:59.619 
the constraint comes from a certain

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:10.130 
the constraint comes from a certain
limitation<00:02:01.049> imposed<00:02:02.049> by<00:02:04.170> certain<00:02:05.170> inbuilt

structure of cause and effect you are

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:53.850 
structure of cause and effect you are
able<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:46.739> believe<00:02:47.739> in<00:02:47.920> 5000<00:02:50.580> because<00:02:52.799> do<00:02:53.799> you

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
able to believe in 5000 because do you

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.430 
able to believe in 5000 because do you
think<00:02:54.190> that<00:02:54.400> is<00:02:54.549> my<00:02:54.760> salary<00:02:55.269> because<00:02:55.540> who

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
think that is my salary because who

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.360 
think that is my salary because who
thick<00:02:56.739> enough<00:02:57.599> there's<00:02:58.599> also<00:02:58.870> a<00:02:59.019> cause

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
thick enough there's also a cause

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.080 
thick enough there's also a cause
because<00:03:00.370> that's<00:03:00.910> my<00:03:01.090> salary<00:03:02.760> why<00:03:03.760> you<00:03:03.820> are<00:03:04.030> not

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
because that's my salary why you are not

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.160 
because that's my salary why you are not
able<00:03:04.900> to<00:03:05.260> make<00:03:05.560> 10,000<00:03:06.390> because<00:03:07.390> that<00:03:07.840> is<00:03:07.989> not

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
able to make 10,000 because that is not

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.840 
able to make 10,000 because that is not
my<00:03:08.230> salary<00:03:10.620> so<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.680> have<00:03:12.100> to<00:03:12.280> change<00:03:12.609> the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:12.850 
my salary so you have to change the

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
my salary so you have to change the
cause<00:03:15.480> if<00:03:16.480> you<00:03:16.690> change<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.380> cause<00:03:17.739> which<00:03:18.670> is

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
cause if you change the cause which is

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.580 
cause if you change the cause which is
the<00:03:20.970> concept<00:03:21.970> and<00:03:22.120> notion<00:03:22.359> that<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:23.049> have

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.480 

really<00:03:26.590> based<00:03:27.010> on<00:03:27.250> certain

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:30.490 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:34.990 

notion<00:03:31.490> or<00:03:31.640> believe<00:03:32.540> or<00:03:32.810> you<00:03:33.550> may<00:03:34.550> even<00:03:34.760> call

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
notion or believe or you may even call

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.610 
notion or believe or you may even call
it<00:03:35.150> a<00:03:35.240> reality

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.259 

all<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.489> you<00:03:40.610> need<00:03:40.790> to<00:03:40.940> do<00:03:41.090> is<00:03:41.360> just<00:03:41.980> know<00:03:43.269> how

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
all that you need to do is just know how

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:55.479 
all that you need to do is just know how
you<00:03:44.330> can<00:03:46.510> change<00:03:47.510> that<00:03:47.840> concept<00:03:48.830> and<00:03:50.709> be<00:03:54.190> in<00:03:55.190> a

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489 
you can change that concept and be in a

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.860 
you can change that concept and be in a
position<00:03:56.019> that<00:03:57.019> you<00:03:57.709> can<00:03:58.040> grow<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.700> alter<00:03:59.420> the
