down low unique angles for videography

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.209 
down low unique angles for videography
and<00:01:59.780> then<00:02:00.780> again<00:02:01.170> I'll<00:02:01.320> twist<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.950> and

shorten<00:02:03.090> it<00:02:03.740> and<00:02:04.740> that's<00:02:04.920> how<00:02:05.070> easy<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.610> to

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
shorten it and that's how easy it is to

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.690 
shorten it and that's how easy it is to
use<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.329> istabilizer<00:02:06.719> monopod<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.039> some<00:02:08.580> of

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
use the istabilizer monopod so some of

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.249 
use the istabilizer monopod so some of
the<00:02:08.759> scenarios<00:02:09.090> where<00:02:09.539> you<00:02:09.660> would<00:02:09.810> use<00:02:10.050> this

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
the scenarios where you would use this

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.199 
the scenarios where you would use this
if<00:02:10.500> you're<00:02:10.619> traveling<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.430> you're<00:02:11.940> walking

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
if you're traveling and you're walking

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.010 
if you're traveling and you're walking
and<00:02:12.569> you<00:02:12.660> want<00:02:12.840> to

and you want to

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.720 
and you want to
film<00:02:13.200> you<00:02:13.920> know<00:02:14.010> if<00:02:14.100> you're<00:02:14.220> trying<00:02:14.340> to<00:02:14.460> film

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
film you know if you're trying to film

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.370 
film you know if you're trying to film

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
yourself while you're walking on a hike

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.950 
yourself while you're walking on a hike
for<00:02:16.710> example<00:02:17.250> you<00:02:17.760> can<00:02:17.970> capture<00:02:18.210> footage<00:02:18.570> to

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
for example you can capture footage to

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.440 
for example you can capture footage to
do<00:02:19.080> that<00:02:19.260> if<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:20.010> want<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.310> capture<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> unique

do that if I want to capture a unique

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.380 
do that if I want to capture a unique
angle<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.650> same<00:02:22.950> hike<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.550> can<00:02:24.030> have<00:02:24.210> it

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
angle on that same hike I can have it

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.140 
angle on that same hike I can have it
down<00:02:24.630> low<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.650> know<00:02:26.280> something<00:02:26.670> kind<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.970> down

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
down low you know something kind of down

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.050 
down low you know something kind of down
low<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.750> it's<00:02:27.930> filming<00:02:28.550> the<00:02:29.550> feet<00:02:29.820> for

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
low and it's filming the feet for

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.120 
low and it's filming the feet for
example<00:02:30.150> that's<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.780> really<00:02:31.080> neat<00:02:31.230> angle<00:02:31.650> or

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
example that's a really neat angle or

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.040 
example that's a really neat angle or
just<00:02:32.370> for<00:02:32.520> photography<00:02:33.150> if<00:02:33.300> I<00:02:33.420> want<00:02:33.630> to<00:02:33.750> use<00:02:33.870> it

just for photography if I want to use it

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.250 
just for photography if I want to use it

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
that you can use an app that has a timer

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.610 
that you can use an app that has a timer
the<00:02:44.970> native<00:02:45.330> app<00:02:45.600> on<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.050> iPhone<00:02:46.380> doesn't

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
the native app on the iPhone doesn't

have<00:02:46.890> one<00:02:47.360> some<00:02:48.360> androids<00:02:48.780> do<00:02:49.080> but<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.130> can

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
have one some androids do but you can

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.470 
also if you're using an iPhone you can
also<00:02:52.500> consider<00:02:52.980> using<00:02:53.250> our<00:02:53.730> shutter<00:02:54.150> remote

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
also consider using our shutter remote

bluetooth and then you can just push a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.680 
bluetooth and then you can just push a
button<00:02:58.260> and<00:02:58.650> take<00:02:58.890> pictures<00:02:59.240> or<00:03:00.240> start<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.660> a

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
that you would do on a GoPro this does

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.110 
that you would do on a GoPro this does
work<00:03:41.310> underwater<00:03:41.820> as<00:03:42.810> does<00:03:43.470> the<00:03:43.620> GoPro<00:03:44.120> but

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
work underwater as does the GoPro but

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.080 
work underwater as does the GoPro but
you<00:03:45.240> can<00:03:45.420> use<00:03:45.570> this<00:03:45.720> with<00:03:45.930> other<00:03:46.250> cameras<00:03:47.250> POV

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
you can use this with other cameras POV

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.050 
you can use this with other cameras POV
cameras<00:03:48.510> like<00:03:48.690> the<00:03:48.840> GoPro<00:03:49.320> the<00:03:49.350> contour<00:03:50.190> so

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
cameras like the GoPro the contour so

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.060
