of instructions you'll see how to get

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:28.819 
of instructions you'll see how to get
ready<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.290> get<00:01:28.409> set<00:01:28.680> up

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
ready and get set up

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.310 
ready and get set up
I<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.460> play<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.700> game<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:30.150> how<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.420> play<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
I just play the game and how to play a

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.600 
I just play the game and how to play a
lot<00:01:31.560> of<00:01:31.650> them<00:01:31.799> more<00:01:31.950> challenging<00:01:32.490> I<00:01:32.579> think

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
lot of them more challenging I think

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.370 
lot of them more challenging I think
about<00:01:32.909> older<00:01:33.240> off<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.540> find<00:01:33.750> it<00:01:33.930> just<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.200> lot

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
about older off you find it just a lot

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.120 
about older off you find it just a lot
easier

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
easier

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:36.890 
easier
so<00:01:35.549> we'll<00:01:35.909> just<00:01:36.090> we'll<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.360> ahead<00:01:36.479> and<00:01:36.630> get

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
so we'll just we'll go ahead and get

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.649 
so we'll just we'll go ahead and get
this<00:01:37.110> working<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:38.100> so<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> board

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
this working up so this is the board

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.840 
this working up so this is the board
game<00:01:39.869> here<00:01:40.200> this<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.710> very<00:01:40.860> simple<00:01:41.310> self<00:01:41.579> it's

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
game here this is very simple self it's

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.370 
game here this is very simple self it's
just<00:01:42.060> like<00:01:42.210> other<00:01:42.420> one<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.659> the<00:01:42.840> games<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.170> just

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
just like other one of the games we just

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.889 
just like other one of the games we just
since<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.649> unfold<00:01:44.070> that<00:01:44.250> and<00:01:44.360> for<00:01:45.360> evening

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
so if you want to make this game a

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.950 
so if you want to make this game a
little<00:04:52.400> more<00:04:52.700> challenging<00:04:53.150> and<00:04:53.450> you<00:04:53.540> can't<00:04:53.780> do

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
little more challenging and you can't do

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.110 
little more challenging and you can't do
so<00:04:54.200> for<00:04:55.010> example<00:04:55.100> you<00:04:55.610> could<00:04:55.730> try<00:04:55.850> different

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
so for example you could try different

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:59.560 
so for example you could try different
real<00:04:56.480> such<00:04:56.750> as<00:04:57.020> if<00:04:57.620> you<00:04:57.980> have<00:04:58.250> two<00:04:58.940> of<00:04:59.180> the<00:04:59.210> same

00:04:59.560 --> 00:04:59.570 
real such as if you have two of the same

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.380 
real such as if you have two of the same
color<00:04:59.840> of<00:05:00.430> sweetheart<00:05:01.430> that<00:05:01.610> you<00:05:01.760> own<00:05:02.000> it<00:05:02.240> so

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
color of sweetheart that you own it so

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.270 
color of sweetheart that you own it so
in<00:05:02.510> London<00:05:02.690> you<00:05:03.200> could<00:05:03.380> charge<00:05:03.650> them<00:05:03.860> double

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
in London you could charge them double

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.510 
in London you could charge them double
from<00:05:04.460> London<00:05:04.820> Square<00:05:05.479> or<00:05:06.290> you<00:05:06.680> could<00:05:06.890> do<00:05:07.070> you

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:07.520 
from London Square or you could do you

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.210 
from London Square or you could do you
could<00:05:07.640> swap<00:05:08.000> screen<00:05:08.570> cards<00:05:08.930> for<00:05:09.169> example<00:05:09.680> if<00:05:09.890> I

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
could swap screen cards for example if I

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.310 
could swap screen cards for example if I
had<00:05:10.820> two<00:05:10.940> pink<00:05:11.180> one<00:05:11.450> I'm<00:05:11.690> somebody<00:05:12.140> had<00:05:12.290> a

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:12.320 
had two pink one I'm somebody had a

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.960 
had two pink one I'm somebody had a
green<00:05:12.560> one<00:05:12.680> and<00:05:12.860> I<00:05:12.950> went<00:05:13.160> to<00:05:13.280> be<00:05:13.400> one<00:05:13.580> I<00:05:13.760> could

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
green one and I went to be one I could

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.390 
green one and I went to be one I could
swap<00:05:14.320> cards<00:05:15.320> with<00:05:15.440> means<00:05:15.620> I<00:05:15.800> would<00:05:15.950> also<00:05:16.130> have

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 
swap cards with means I would also have

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:17.740 
swap cards with means I would also have
to<00:05:16.430> swap<00:05:16.850> with<00:05:17.000> you<00:05:17.090> know<00:05:17.240> parents<00:05:17.570> that<00:05:17.690> you

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
to swap with you know parents that you

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.080 
to swap with you know parents that you
can't<00:05:18.020> see<00:05:18.620> the<00:05:18.680> time<00:05:19.010> but<00:05:19.610> that's<00:05:19.700> not<00:05:19.910> bad

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
can't see the time but that's not bad

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.150 
can't see the time but that's not bad
thing<00:05:20.270> because<00:05:20.390> like<00:05:20.540> I<00:05:20.690> see<00:05:20.930> if<00:05:21.200> you<00:05:21.320> have<00:05:21.500> too

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:22.160 
thing because like I see if you have too

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.070 
thing because like I see if you have too
busy<00:05:22.370> on<00:05:22.490> clothing<00:05:22.970> you<00:05:23.090> can<00:05:23.360> charge<00:05:23.720> more

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
busy on clothing you can charge more

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.950 
busy on clothing you can charge more
money<00:05:24.760> so<00:05:25.760> that's<00:05:25.940> basically<00:05:26.330> the<00:05:26.450> idea<00:05:26.540> of

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
money so that's basically the idea of

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.050 
money so that's basically the idea of
the<00:05:27.050> game<00:05:27.290> is<00:05:27.410> to<00:05:27.590> try<00:05:27.620> and<00:05:27.979> collect<00:05:28.160> as<00:05:28.640> many

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.960 
the game is to try and collect as many
muscle<00:05:29.479> University<00:05:29.900> want<00:05:30.110> as<00:05:30.500> much<00:05:30.729> money<00:05:31.729> as
