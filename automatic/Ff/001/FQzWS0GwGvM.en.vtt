Hi, everybody Joey here again, and welcome back so in today's video

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.319
I'm going to show you how to filter [to] aquariums with one filter now

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.559
This is actually a project that many people are interested in but are sometimes faced with the only real option being to

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.990
Drill the tanks have some sort of overflow then stack them on top of each other however

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.459
Most of you are looking to filter a pair of tanks [that] are actually side by side

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.640
And that's exactly what we're going to cover in today's video first

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.380
I want to jump right into this project

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.630
Then we'll come [back] and talk about cost how to size the filter tank sizes I recommend this for

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.960
Flow rates and cover some of the pros and cons as well

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.950
The biggest challenge might appear to be how to keep the water level in both tanks level with each other while allowing water to easily

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.149
Transfer from one to the other and while this might seem [like] the biggest challenge is actually

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.669
Not in fact you already know how to do this because in the past I did a video on how to build a water bridge

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.580
A popular project that will allow you to connect to tanks and watch your 5th limb from one tank to [the] other

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.989
We'll be using that exact idea yet using PVC to create it

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.819
All you need is a couple of elbows and enough PVC pipe to span the difference of both tanks

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:10.750
creating a small

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:18.059
U-Shape with it ensuring that you cement it together as well now ideally you'll want the PVC to enter the aquarium by a few inches

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.779
Especially if you have a turbid water surface that could break the seal we're going to create to prime the bridge and to create that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.770
seal I like to use a couple of

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:27.270
PVC

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.280
End caps to cover the ends once I fill it with water you could also use the palms of your hands though

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.489
now water will stay inside of the bridge as the atmospheric pressure on the outside of the pipe is actually greater than

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.429
Inside and I explain [all] the details as well as how is it works in the water bridge video that I mentioned [earlier]

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.939
So make sure you check that video if you haven't seen something like this before

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.259
Now if water is added to one tank it equalizes in the other for example

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.089
If I remove water from one tank and add it to the other both tanks will stay in

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.129
Equilibrium the parts to create this small bridge actually only cost me [$3] however

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.360
We're [going] to get the flow rates and sizing it later on in the video [as] for the filter

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.369
Well, we could do almost anything at this point

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.769
but I figured that if we're going to be filtering [two] tanks at once while of course keeping it fully customized full and

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:20.010
Cost-effective, so I went with the overhead filter. It's actually something that I like to call the overhead sump luckily

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.870
I showed you how to build one of these in the past as well

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.870
So we'll keep this simple [I] use the plastic planner now

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.370
These come in a variety of sizes

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.190
But I want to focus on the 18 inch 24 inch and 36 inch versions as guideline for this example

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.589
I use the 18 inch size I drilled the hole in the bottom the size I needed according to the flow Rate [I]

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.719
Needed to flow through it again. I'm going to get to the sizing this as well later on I took a male and female

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.149
PVC adapter and created a makeshift bulkhead however since this will be [over] the tank

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.840
I just added a dab of silicone to seal it this will act as my drain

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.780
I then took a small piece [of] PVC pipe and heated it up with a heat gun until I could bend it this will allow

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.660
Me to direct the flow of the water into the tank then I took a couple of spare sponges and created Baffles basically

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.529
That's just an easy way for me to separate my plumbing from the media from there

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:13.169
I used a small power head to act as my pump to deliver water to the filter and you can use whatever pump you want

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.060
Though or even an airlift will work

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.160
I use some sea PVC that I also heated up with a heat gun to form the [U] for the return again

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.429
We'll talk about flow rate soon for [biological] Media

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.209
I use some basic Lav arak a very porous and lightweight type of rock with an excellent biological filtering capacity

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.699
I bought a 7-pound bag for [5] bucks

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.989
Enough for five of these filters in this example and just to give you a visual idea

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:38.970
I added it in loose however

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.749
I would suggest adding yours and [2] mesh bags for easier removal later on now as a side [note] the lab rocks were actually labeled

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.179
For barbecues however with a quick rinse. It's still lav iraq regardless of the name you put in front of it

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:55.080
Keep that [in] mind next time you're looking for a cheap effective and long-lasting

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.959
Biological filter Media the entire filter cost me $3 for the planter $2 for the bulkhead

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.269
$1 where the [see] PVC and a dollar worth a LAv arak so seven dollars total?

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.269
This doesn't include the sponge that I already had nor the pump now depending on the pump you use that cost [will] fluctuate

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:15.809
Anyways plus I already had this so in total I invested

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:22.320
$10 however with all do it yourself projects costs always fluctuate depending on where you are. So how does this work?

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.999
Well as water is delivered to the top of the filter the water first flows through the sponge

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.389
Where it is mechanically filtered followed by flowing through the biological?

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:35.609
Media or whatever else you decide to add to it the water then flows through the last sponge before

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:41.699
Overflowing into the second tank now at this point the water is in the second tank and can begin to flow back through

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:45.629
To the other side through the water bridge finishing the cycle to clean it

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.239
I simply remove the sponges and give them a quick [rinse] then add them back in and that's pretty much it now my suggestion would

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:57.690
Also be to add in some pozos plants to the filter to not only hide it, but also help remove nitrates now

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.149
I've talked about the pozos plants in many other videos, so I'll put some links in the description to all of these videos

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:06.419
I'm talking about so you can watch them later on for a filter like this

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:11.549
I would recommend a flow rate of [4] to [6] times per hour for example a pair of 25 gallon

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:17.789
Tanks will give you 50 gallons total so you'll want a flow rate [of] 200 300 gallons per hour for a setup like that to

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:22.199
Size the filter I suggest using the 18 inch version for two tanks totaling up to

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:26.460
75 gallons the 24 inch version for two tanks totaling up to

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:31.169
120 [gallons] and the 36 inch version for two tanks totaling up to

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:32.440
200 gallons

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:39.299
[the] Bridge flow rates that I've tested were one inch one and a half inch and 2 inch I found that the ideal flow rates

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.120
to be 300 600 and 900 gallons per hour

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.340
Were ideal before the bridge?

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:50.189
struggled to keep the water levels even now some of your smaller fish will still be able to travel up [through] the bridge and if

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.880
You don't want that to happen

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.829
I suggest adding a little bit of mesh to each end to stop that from [happening] and maybe hold it in place with some

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:02.039
Elastics or a few dabs of silicone as for the drain these are actually [size] the same as normal bulkheads [wood]?

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:04.978
however for all of the sizes of filters I've listed them the

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.159
Recommended flow rates a one-inch bulkhead seems to work for all of them the good thing about this filter is you can actually filter two?

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:12.580
tanks in a sump like

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.449
Fashion for very little money [you] [also] have very little equipment in the tank if you plan [to] add a heater to it though

00:06:18.449 --> 00:06:23.968
[I] would add a small pipe to the drain to ensure [that] the planner doesn't fully drain when the power goes out

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.849
Now the downside to this filter is it's not very

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:30.329
Pretty however adding some of those poe those plants to cover

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:36.599
It will make it look a lot nicer while serving a meaningful purpose the other downside is you have no control over

00:06:36.969 --> 00:06:39.479
Transmission of disease if something is in one [too]

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:44.249
Think it's going to get to the other so I was suggest using this on tanks with fish that were properly

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:48.270
Quarantined [on] that note what I personally like about this setup

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:50.270
The most is using it for breeding

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:56.249
The pair in one tank and the fry in the second tank and this ensures that all water perimeters are actually identical

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:02.790
In both tanks which can be vital especially for sensitive fry anyways. I hope that you guys enjoyed this video

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.730
I also want to thank you for watching and I'll see you guys next Sunday

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
for a new project
