00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.240
 I already bought 2 and it was the best thing I 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.420
 I did it because I lost this nigga I lost 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.439

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.770
 hit somewhere 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:55.890
 This is where it comes from, it 's actually a 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.020
 padded to the phone and depending on 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.000
 I cell recording and putting 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.500
 depending on the phone if you take it 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.240
 stay here only in the iron 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.680
 there can escape forward so he 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.020
 She's half insured. 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.489
 here he also has a dinha cushion 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.940
 what is to hold the cell phone so that 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.060
 To slide forward on this tripod he is 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.640
 semi professional 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.220
 I've had this tripod for more than five 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.599
 years of the time I was studying 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.730
 of photography 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.790
 so he's regular and he gets super 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:28.450
 tall he arrives almost five feet and 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:32.530
 he is super regular is great and is one of the 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.690
 best tripod at the time I paid 70 or 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.610
 90 reais in it now should be around 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.810
 130 130 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.519
 so I put the iphone in the front 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.830
 and I recorded the videos what I said to 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.930
 you get the cell phone fire of a quality 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.870
 too bad the front of the camera you 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.989
 can put upside down and ask to 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.690
 that a person on the side of there or if you 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:03:00.580
 I have it on my own, it's more or less 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:03.010
 where you will stay and and has no record 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.410
 there is not much choice there after 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:08.049
 edit time you cut then you 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.200
 you can push the play to sit and be 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.150
 and then you cut the edit 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:15.250
 I 'm doing this until I send my 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.350
 camera for assistance when I send it 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:19.120
 my camera for assistance there I 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.640
 I record with that little camera again. 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.989
 So what was I talking about for you? 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.519
 I'll send my phone for 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:30.280
 assistance because he is still in the 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:32.709
 warranty is 2017 and 2017 by samsung 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.620
 it is under warranty for two years or 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.239
 be until 2016 and then I made the guarantee 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.579
 extended so it is under warranty for 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.799
 three years and he is giving an error in 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:43.959
 so I'm recording the phone is 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.840
 the quality is not bad after you can 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.930
 edit help help is not equal to one 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.910
 light camera but soon more to 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:57.310
 front I intend to buy a camera myself 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:59.440
 she had a canon she did not lower it 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.209
 price is still around one thousand reais 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.400
 so it 's her that I want to buy again 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.530
 and I'm going to collect a buck and I'm going 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.239
 Buy her but for now I 'm 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.510

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:12.790
 for you and it's been really cool if not ok 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.489

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:18.609
