00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390 
care so first I'll talk about one thing

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.630 
care so first I'll talk about one thing
here's<00:00:17.630> my<00:00:17.869> my<00:00:18.350> pedalboard<00:00:18.710> setting<00:00:19.490> this<00:00:19.580> up

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:19.640 
here's my my pedalboard setting this up

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.779 
here's my my pedalboard setting this up
here<00:00:20.029> so<00:00:20.390> I<00:00:20.630> really<00:00:21.589> don't<00:00:22.099> know<00:00:22.220> what<00:00:22.400> half<00:00:22.609> of

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:22.789 
here so I really don't know what half of

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.929 
here so I really don't know what half of
these<00:00:22.910> things<00:00:23.119> do<00:00:23.480> but<00:00:24.349> there<00:00:25.220> I<00:00:25.249> like<00:00:25.759> the

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:25.939 
these things do but there I like the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.210 
these things do but there I like the
colors<00:00:26.470> polytene<00:00:27.470> I'm<00:00:27.679> assuming<00:00:28.039> that<00:00:28.130> has

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.220 
colors polytene I'm assuming that has

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.339 
colors polytene I'm assuming that has
something<00:00:28.460> to<00:00:28.550> do<00:00:28.699> with<00:00:28.789> tuning<00:00:29.150> put<00:00:30.050> that<00:00:30.230> in

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:30.349 
something to do with tuning put that in

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.290 
something to do with tuning put that in
front<00:00:30.650> because<00:00:31.009> it's<00:00:31.220> a<00:00:31.279> nice<00:00:31.460> white<00:00:31.820> and<00:00:32.150> it

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
front because it's a nice white and it

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.930 
front because it's a nice white and it
matches<00:00:32.540> real<00:00:33.050> well<00:00:33.230> black<00:00:33.670> then<00:00:34.670> what<00:00:34.820> I<00:00:34.850> do

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
matches real well black then what I do

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.910 
matches real well black then what I do
also<00:00:35.180> i<00:00:35.360> put<00:00:35.660> some<00:00:35.840> tape<00:00:36.050> on<00:00:36.230> there<00:00:36.440> that<00:00:36.620> makes

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
also i put some tape on there that makes

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.320 
also i put some tape on there that makes
it<00:00:37.040> look<00:00:37.250> like<00:00:37.670> I've<00:00:37.790> actually<00:00:37.970> gone<00:00:38.270> through

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
it look like I've actually gone through

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.650 
it look like I've actually gone through
and<00:00:38.870> I<00:00:39.860> know<00:00:39.890> what<00:00:40.520> my<00:00:40.610> settings<00:00:41.060> are<00:00:41.180> I<00:00:41.360> really

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:41.660 
and I know what my settings are I really

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.540 
and I know what my settings are I really
don't<00:00:41.750> know<00:00:41.870> what<00:00:42.080> the<00:00:42.140> hell<00:00:42.260> that<00:00:42.290> I<00:00:42.410> mean<00:00:42.710> you

don't know what the hell that I mean you
could<00:00:43.670> do<00:00:43.790> that<00:00:43.940> I<00:00:44.150> don't<00:00:44.360> know<00:00:44.480> what<00:00:44.750> that

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
could do that I don't know what that

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.970 
could do that I don't know what that

does OCD I have that so I figure man

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.070 
does OCD I have that so I figure man
might<00:00:49.340> as<00:00:49.400> well<00:00:49.580> get<00:00:50.090> that<00:00:50.240> going<00:00:50.450> riot<00:00:50.810> I

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:57.500 
me covered I don't even have this one

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.890 
me covered I don't even have this one
plugged<00:00:57.740> in<00:00:57.950> they<00:00:58.700> misspelled<00:00:59.150> wild<00:00:59.570> that's

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
plugged in they misspelled wild that's

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.780 
plugged in they misspelled wild that's
why<00:01:00.080> I<00:01:00.380> don't<00:01:00.680> trust<00:01:00.800> that<00:01:01.100> they<00:01:01.430> came<00:01:01.640> and

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
why I don't trust that they came and

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.679 
why I don't trust that they came and
spill<00:01:02.000> that<00:01:02.180> right<00:01:03.500> that<00:01:04.479> this<00:01:05.479> one's

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:05.689 
spill that right that this one's

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.170 
spill that right that this one's
green<00:01:05.930> right<00:01:06.650> more<00:01:06.979> tape<00:01:07.220> and<00:01:07.880> there's<00:01:08.060> some

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
green right more tape and there's some

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.690 
green right more tape and there's some
cool<00:01:08.359> knobs<00:01:08.780> there<00:01:09.140> this<00:01:10.070> one's<00:01:10.249> a<00:01:10.340> darker

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
cool knobs there this one's a darker

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.160 
cool knobs there this one's a darker
green<00:01:10.729> so<00:01:11.149> I<00:01:11.210> figure<00:01:11.539> lighter<00:01:12.439> darker<00:01:14.170> could

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
green so I figure lighter darker could

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.410 
green so I figure lighter darker could
be<00:01:15.259> better<00:01:15.469> I<00:01:15.740> don't<00:01:16.340> know<00:01:16.429> again<00:01:16.729> it's<00:01:16.909> got<00:01:17.329> an

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
be better I don't know again it's got an

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.880 
be better I don't know again it's got an
extra<00:01:17.630> button<00:01:17.869> here<00:01:18.140> I<00:01:18.320> don't<00:01:18.619> really<00:01:18.710> know

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
extra button here I don't really know

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.039 
extra button here I don't really know
what<00:01:19.009> that<00:01:19.039> does<00:01:19.159> some<00:01:19.909> custom<00:01:20.240> cables<00:01:20.630> here<00:01:20.840> I

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:21.049 
what that does some custom cables here I

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:22.300 
what that does some custom cables here I
don't<00:01:21.229> know<00:01:21.289> if<00:01:21.380> they<00:01:21.469> work<00:01:21.679> probably<00:01:22.039> wire

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:22.310 
don't know if they work probably wire

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.789 
don't know if they work probably wire

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950 
play as badly as I do I pass these out

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.400
