00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.620 
after that substitution he was directly
involved<00:02:56.490> having<00:02:56.880> this<00:02:57.090> shot<00:02:57.330> from<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.600> edge

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
involved having this shot from the edge

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.360 
involved having this shot from the edge
of<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.810> box<00:02:57.990> but<00:02:58.140> unfortunately<00:02:58.680> all<00:02:59.100> of<00:02:59.160> the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
of the box but unfortunately all of the

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.890 
of the box but unfortunately all of the
place<00:02:59.580> was<00:02:59.790> taken<00:02:59.970> out<00:03:00.270> of<00:03:00.390> that<00:03:00.480> effort<00:03:00.600> but

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
place was taken out of that effort but

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.660 
place was taken out of that effort but
he<00:03:01.290> made<00:03:01.440> an<00:03:01.590> instant<00:03:01.920> impact<00:03:02.010> so<00:03:02.430> I<00:03:02.460> thought

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
he made an instant impact so I thought

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.520 
he made an instant impact so I thought
well<00:03:02.820> if<00:03:03.030> he's<00:03:03.210> had<00:03:03.390> been<00:03:03.690> able<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.990> making

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
well if he's had been able to making

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.990 
well if he's had been able to making
it's<00:03:04.650> an<00:03:04.770> impact<00:03:05.040> maybe<00:03:05.220> two<00:03:05.520> more<00:03:05.670> people

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
it's an impact maybe two more people

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.400 
it's an impact maybe two more people
might<00:03:06.120> be<00:03:06.240> able<00:03:06.330> to<00:03:06.510> as<00:03:06.630> well<00:03:06.660> Ross<00:03:06.990> Barkley

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
might be able to as well Ross Barkley

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:08.930 
might be able to as well Ross Barkley

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
tactical genius for me perhaps or maybe

tactical genius for me perhaps or maybe
I<00:03:49.170> was<00:03:49.260> just<00:03:49.530> a<00:03:49.830> little<00:03:49.980> bit<00:03:50.160> lucky<00:03:50.430> with<00:03:50.580> the

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
I was just a little bit lucky with the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.920 
I was just a little bit lucky with the
fact<00:03:50.850> that<00:03:50.910> they<00:03:51.090> were<00:03:51.150> involved<00:03:51.420> medially

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
fact that they were involved medially

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.420 
fact that they were involved medially
and<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.140> may<00:03:52.230> just<00:03:52.470> happen<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.920> be<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.040> people

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
and it may just happen to be the people

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.370 
and it may just happen to be the people
on<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.730> end<00:03:53.850> of<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.090> passes<00:03:54.510> but<00:03:54.660> a<00:03:54.870> good<00:03:55.170> shot

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
on the end of the passes but a good shot

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.600 
on the end of the passes but a good shot
by<00:03:55.500> cos<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.860> bending<00:03:56.100> it<00:03:56.220> around<00:03:56.459> the

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
by cos the bending it around the

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:57.770 
by cos the bending it around the

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
tried to drill it low I think it would

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:00.590 
tried to drill it low I think it would
have<00:03:59.489> just<00:03:59.520> smashed<00:03:59.730> it<00:04:00.030> straight<00:04:00.270> into<00:04:00.420> the

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
have just smashed it straight into the

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.760 
have just smashed it straight into the
legs<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:00.959> defender<00:04:01.290> trying<00:04:01.500> to<00:04:01.560> make<00:04:01.680> the

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
legs of the defender trying to make the

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.740 
legs of the defender trying to make the
block<00:04:01.980> but<00:04:02.250> luckily<00:04:02.459> for<00:04:02.760> me<00:04:02.880> they<00:04:03.360> bent<00:04:03.600> it

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
block but luckily for me they bent it

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.270 
block but luckily for me they bent it
around<00:04:04.020> him<00:04:04.230> and<00:04:04.350> that<00:04:04.500> was<00:04:04.620> able<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:04.950> make<00:04:05.100> it

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
around him and that was able to make it

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.800 
around him and that was able to make it
to<00:04:05.489> 12<00:04:05.790> what's<00:04:05.940> really<00:04:06.209> nice<00:04:06.330> football<00:04:06.630> here
