00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:13.990
 First of all using this glue gun 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.990
 We attach motif of flower and Kurume button of 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.430
 Women and teams 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.700
 Ny 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.700
 of 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.360
 What 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.020
 what 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.140
 I will put on 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.820
 This is already 

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:44.420
 Easily 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.420
 arrived 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:56.430
 Next, this leaf motif and this small degree 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.430
 I will put on the bond 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:06.770
 Be this way, dirty hands and go put across with a pair of tweezers 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.950
 As work is hard to get dirty, too 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.060
 I think it is easy to do 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.060
 Adhesive 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.570
 Just like putting on the contact side 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.740
 I want to add 12 minutes 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.740
 I will stick 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:34.190
 light 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.190
 The part that is not attached while checking the processing attached to the front is 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.369
 Masu as 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.369
 Even the chief of 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.619
 And or 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.840
 Apply the adhesive 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.720
 I will adhere 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.240
 Put this and this here 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:02:01.260
 That's why 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:03.860
 I think it is easier to put it on this side , so on the other side of this 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.860
 Glue 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.450
 top 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.110
 Hold it lightly 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.130
 I'm sticking 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.130
 This is done 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:37.130
 Like this 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.130
 I also made various color patterns 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:50.850
 I think I can use such a pearl or even a button on hand 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.890
 Various things such as putting on shush 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.770
 Because it can be used for accessories 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:03:01.940
 Even in the Toka Hair 10 days patching pin Please try to make using all means 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:05.710
 I think it is cute 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.710
 It ends with above
