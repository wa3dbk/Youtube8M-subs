his face and I put him a little bit
closer<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.490> front<00:01:30.770> so<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:32.220> looks<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.460> little

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 
closer on front so it looks a little

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:44.330 
closer on front so it looks a little
more<00:01:32.820> movie<00:01:33.150> accurate<00:01:42.860> I'm<00:01:43.860> gonna<00:01:44.010> get<00:01:44.190> a<00:01:44.220> look

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
more movie accurate I'm gonna get a look

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.150 
more movie accurate I'm gonna get a look
at<00:01:44.400> that<00:01:45.290> and<00:01:46.290> uh<00:01:48.050> I'm<00:01:49.050> gonna<00:01:49.200> see<00:01:49.650> clearly

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
at that and uh I'm gonna see clearly

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.690 
at that and uh I'm gonna see clearly
here<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:50.850> uh<00:01:50.880> yeah<00:01:51.420> she<00:01:51.600> has<00:01:51.720> red<00:01:52.020> eyes<00:01:52.700> maybe

here but uh yeah she has red eyes maybe

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.190 
here but uh yeah she has red eyes maybe
it<00:01:53.910> bounces<00:01:54.390> off<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.510> light<00:01:54.780> you<00:01:54.900> can<00:01:54.930> maybe

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
it bounces off the light you can maybe

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.490 
it bounces off the light you can maybe
see<00:01:55.470> it<00:01:57.920> right<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.250> can<00:01:59.400> see<00:01:59.550> it<00:01:59.640> maybe

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:00.500 
see it right there you can see it maybe

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.550 
see it right there you can see it maybe
that's<00:02:01.500> clear<00:02:01.920> blue<00:02:02.130> clear<00:02:02.550> red<00:02:03.080> so<00:02:04.080> it<00:02:04.200> gives

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
that's clear blue clear red so it gives

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.720 
that's clear blue clear red so it gives
off<00:02:04.680> night<00:02:05.270> velocity<00:02:06.270> look<00:02:06.830> and<00:02:10.490> other<00:02:11.490> than

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
off night velocity look and other than

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.420 
off night velocity look and other than
that<00:02:11.850> I<00:02:14.780> changed<00:02:15.780> his<00:02:15.900> murder<00:02:16.170> arm<00:02:16.470> as<00:02:16.739> you<00:02:17.280> can

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
that I changed his murder arm as you can

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.210 
that I changed his murder arm as you can
see<00:02:17.610> I<00:02:17.880> gave<00:02:18.450> it<00:02:18.780> up<00:02:18.840> ball<00:02:19.140> joints<00:02:19.680> you<00:02:20.040> could

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
see I gave it up ball joints you could

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.100 
see I gave it up ball joints you could
rotate<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.850> so<00:02:21.120> that<00:02:21.150> being<00:02:21.450> stiff<00:02:21.959> and

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
rotate it so that being stiff and

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.780 
rotate it so that being stiff and
everything<00:02:27.530> since<00:02:28.530> since<00:02:29.190> it's<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.550> ball

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
everything since since it's on a ball

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.890 
everything since since it's on a ball
joint<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.530> also<00:02:31.530> have<00:02:32.010> an<00:02:32.880> alternative<00:02:33.420> arm<00:02:33.630> for

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
joint I also have an alternative arm for

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:34.570 
joint I also have an alternative arm for
him

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
him

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.500 
him
so<00:02:35.580> one<00:02:35.820> knees<00:02:35.940> doesn't<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.630> this<00:02:37.310> mess<00:02:38.510> bun

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
so one knees doesn't have this mess bun

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:46.360 
so one knees doesn't have this mess bun
on<00:02:39.660> his<00:02:39.780> hand<00:02:39.989> he<00:02:40.170> has<00:02:40.970> just<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.090> regular<00:02:42.890> and

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:48.970 

so<00:02:47.180> now<00:02:47.360> the<00:02:48.200> rhyming<00:02:48.500> throughout<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.860> whole

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
so now the rhyming throughout the whole

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.930 
so now the rhyming throughout the whole
movie<00:02:49.420> most<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.599> the<00:02:50.660> times<00:02:50.870> anyway<00:02:51.280> so<00:02:52.280> this

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
movie most of the times anyway so this

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.400 
movie most of the times anyway so this
made<00:02:53.180> more<00:02:53.330> sense<00:02:53.599> to<00:02:53.780> give<00:02:54.110> him<00:02:54.260> in<00:02:54.349> the

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
made more sense to give him in the

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.380 
made more sense to give him in the
second<00:02:54.739> hand<00:02:54.950> and<00:02:55.160> this<00:02:55.489> hand<00:02:55.550> is<00:02:55.879> from<00:02:56.120> the

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
second hand and this hand is from the

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.240 
second hand and this hand is from the
first<00:02:56.510> movie<00:02:56.930> Megatron<00:02:57.379> also<00:03:00.160> other<00:03:01.160> than

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
first movie Megatron also other than

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.670 
first movie Megatron also other than
that<00:03:01.519> it<00:03:01.790> was<00:03:01.849> just<00:03:02.000> a<00:03:02.300> straight-up<00:03:02.629> paint<00:03:03.379> job

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
that it was just a straight-up paint job

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.360 
that it was just a straight-up paint job
I<00:03:04.010> painted<00:03:04.970> him<00:03:05.150> first<00:03:05.750> flat<00:03:06.379> black<00:03:06.799> all<00:03:07.069> over

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
all the knobs and random gear parts I

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:28.270 
all the knobs and random gear parts I
painted<00:04:19.070> a<00:04:19.130> gold<00:04:19.669> over<00:04:23.590> the<00:04:24.590> back

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.180 

you<00:04:29.280> see<00:04:29.460> his<00:04:29.640> uh<00:04:29.670> thrusters<00:04:30.300> in<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:30.510> back<00:04:31.190> and

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
you see his uh thrusters in the back and

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:35.810 
you see his uh thrusters in the back and
then<00:04:32.340> his<00:04:32.580> little<00:04:32.670> black<00:04:34.430> details<00:04:35.430> coming<00:04:35.670> out

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
then his little black details coming out

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.600 
then his little black details coming out
of<00:04:35.940> here<00:04:36.150> like<00:04:36.510> from<00:04:36.960> the<00:04:37.260> burning<00:04:37.800> or

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
of here like from the burning or

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.600 
of here like from the burning or
something<00:04:39.120> from<00:04:39.210> the<00:04:39.270> first<00:04:39.630> there's<00:04:40.340> more<00:04:41.340> go

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
something from the first there's more go

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.850 
something from the first there's more go
than<00:04:41.880> the<00:04:41.910> nubs<00:04:42.240> in<00:04:42.690> the<00:04:42.840> gears<00:04:43.140> there<00:04:43.710> went

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
than the nubs in the gears there went

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.350 
than the nubs in the gears there went
nuts<00:04:44.600> so<00:04:45.600> I<00:04:45.630> think<00:04:45.750> I<00:04:46.050> came<00:04:46.290> out<00:04:46.410> pretty<00:04:46.530> well

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:47.360 
nuts so I think I came out pretty well

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.090 
nuts so I think I came out pretty well
um<00:04:48.360> yeah<00:04:48.900> I<00:04:48.930> definitely<00:04:49.050> is<00:04:49.620> definitely<00:04:50.070> a

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
um yeah I definitely is definitely a

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.820 
um yeah I definitely is definitely a
shell<00:04:50.400> figure<00:04:50.820> right<00:04:51.630> after<00:04:51.960> I<00:04:52.020> painted<00:04:52.380> him<00:04:52.530> I

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
shell figure right after I painted him I

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.040 
shell figure right after I painted him I
quoted<00:04:53.370> him<00:04:53.580> with<00:04:54.230> krylon<00:04:55.230> crystal<00:04:55.890> clear<00:04:56.160> I

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
quoted him with krylon crystal clear I

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.690 
quoted him with krylon crystal clear I
think<00:04:58.050> I<00:04:58.140> actually<00:04:58.320> did<00:04:58.560> a<00:04:58.620> twice<00:04:58.920> with<00:04:59.280> gloss

00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.700 
think I actually did a twice with gloss

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.660 
think I actually did a twice with gloss
and<00:05:00.180> then<00:05:00.270> after<00:05:00.540> that<00:05:00.720> I<00:05:00.750> used<00:05:01.050> matte<00:05:01.530> so<00:05:02.460> he

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:02.670 
and then after that I used matte so he

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.430 
and then after that I used matte so he
had<00:05:02.850> the<00:05:02.970> shiny<00:05:03.300> effect<00:05:03.480> but<00:05:03.990> then<00:05:04.140> with<00:05:04.290> the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
had the shiny effect but then with the

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.170 
had the shiny effect but then with the
matte<00:05:04.680> over<00:05:05.040> it<00:05:05.190> and<00:05:05.460> gave<00:05:05.670> him<00:05:05.850> a<00:05:05.970> better

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
matte over it and gave him a better

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.960 
matte over it and gave him a better
texture<00:05:06.840> and<00:05:07.680> feel<00:05:07.920> so<00:05:08.190> he<00:05:08.310> wasn't<00:05:08.460> so<00:05:08.640> shiny

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
texture and feel so he wasn't so shiny

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.080 
texture and feel so he wasn't so shiny
and<00:05:09.120> why<00:05:10.020> not<00:05:10.290> so<00:05:11.160> he<00:05:11.250> feels<00:05:11.460> pretty<00:05:11.640> good<00:05:11.880> and

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
and why not so he feels pretty good and

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:16.070 
and why not so he feels pretty good and
smooth<00:05:13.550> yeah<00:05:14.550> other<00:05:14.820> than<00:05:14.940> that<00:05:15.090> um<00:05:15.660> he's

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
smooth yeah other than that um he's

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.210 
smooth yeah other than that um he's
definitely<00:05:16.500> one<00:05:16.590> of<00:05:16.620> my<00:05:16.680> favorite<00:05:17.010> shell

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 
definitely one of my favorite shell

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:25.159 
definitely one of my favorite shell
figures<00:05:17.670> I<00:05:17.790> have

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:29.809 

let's<00:05:25.710> show<00:05:26.699> him<00:05:26.909> next<00:05:27.509> to<00:05:27.840> a<00:05:28.340> default<00:05:29.340> version

00:05:29.809 --> 00:05:29.819 
let's show him next to a default version

of him not painted so you can really
tell<00:05:32.849> a<00:05:32.879> difference

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.230 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:58.830
