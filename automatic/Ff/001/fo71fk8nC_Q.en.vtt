00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.490
 today in our gardening space 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.889
 let's talk about one of the plants 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.670
 most common interior in homes the 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.410
 trunk of brazil 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.660
 The trunk of Brazil is a plant 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.119
 perennial 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.200
 with such a look shape and with a 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.810
 height that can reach 2 meters 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.660
 of height has a trunk as you can 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.040
 see that it has vertical grooves and 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.590
 horizontal rings brown 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.239
 clarito and a finite straight trunk and the 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.129
 leaves are lanceolate leaves of 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.140
 bright green color they have some 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.960
 bands of green color more clarito 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.640
 longitudinal are the leaves that can 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.550
 measuring between 8 centimeters and one meter 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.100
 height come out in tufts from the trunk 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.540
 This plant is ideal for salons 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.370
 because it is a plant as we have said 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.340
 with a very large bearing with some leaves 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.960
 very beautiful and dresses a lot a room or a 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.820
 patio lights does not require many 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.800
 care is a pretty rustic plant 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.390
 and the first thing you need is a lot 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.860
 lighting if we have it in a room 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.600
 there has to be an area near the 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.430
 window or the patio landslides that has 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.869
 a lot of lighting when you do not have 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.100
 enough lighting the sheets are 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.490
 they turn dark green and 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.720
 disappear the longitudinal bands do not 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.280
 they should never give him the roosters of 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.229
 direct because it causes burns in 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.240
 the leaves with which to be protected from 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.220
 the area with some curtains does not need 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.350
 not much water with which we add 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.440
 once a week would be worth at the time 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.960
 of 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.760
 and twice in summer it would be enough 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.290
 the best thing is to see what is when the 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.900
 substrate is starting to dry in that 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.920
 moment you have to water her big 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.080
 problems usually come by 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.120
 waterlogging with excess water that 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.200
 rots the relative humidity at the roots 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.490
 he also has to be a man of 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.050
 relative high because it is a plant 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.090
 tropical that comes in areas where 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.610
 there is a lot of humidity in the environment 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:48.490
 then we can have a pot with 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.520
 gravel and water under the pot or 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.840
 just spray the very often 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.370
 when we pulverize it simply 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.180
 While the leaves get wet 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.740
 water worth 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.600
 another more important is that we have to 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.550
 have very clean leaves are leaves 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.380
 very large then just with a 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.270
 cloth and similar to the one we just 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.979
 spray with a cloth we clean well 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.680
 the leaves removing all the dust that 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.540
 it accumulates in this way we open the 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.150
 pores and we let the plant breathe 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.220
 well the fertilizer you need is in the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.900
 time of growth to be a subscription 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.120
 special for green leaf plants 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.520
 these fertilizers usually always have something 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:26.740
 of iron that prevents us from having 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.550
 deficiencies in the plant then the form 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.550
 to pay is 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.090
 It is best to pour it into the irrigation water 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:38.769
 we simply put the dose of fertilizer 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.769
 What the manufacturer tells us 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.260
 and we move it a little to mix it 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.610
 well and we just water with this 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.490
 water our plant 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:48.940
 we will do this once a month 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.620
 about the time of 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.170
 growth as we have said 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.690
 we could from the third bud 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:00.330
 green then 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.910
 would be the first the second and the third 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.710
 from this point we could prune 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.660
 the when you have an excess of growth 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.500
 always remove the sheets that are 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:12.890
 brown or withered 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.220
 with a pruning shear we would cut the 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.220
 leaves 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.010
 withered 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.200
 leaving the plant clean 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.160
 It is not a plant that tolerates well 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.170
 Transplants should not be transplanted 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.300
 night that is very necessary between the 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.400
 transplant case and masters every four or 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.020
 five years and it's a very plant 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.870
 resistant has few problems of 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:44.400
 pests and diseases in pests more 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.070
 common that you can have are the fly 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.810
 white the aphid the cochineal the best 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.640
 As soon as we see that any 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:53.070
 pest problem treat it with a 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.040
 specific product and always following 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.150
 very indications of the manufacturer 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.630
 good and I hope that with these tips 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.630
 have some plants in our house 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.630
 spectacular
