family member or a friend or something

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.090 
family member or a friend or something

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.670 
out my hair so it doesn't look as
perfect<00:03:35.389> and<00:03:35.629> then<00:03:36.139> I'm<00:03:36.230> just<00:03:36.409> going<00:03:36.530> to<00:03:36.560> be

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
perfect and then I'm just going to be

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.530 
perfect and then I'm just going to be
playing<00:03:36.950> a<00:03:37.099> little<00:03:37.340> bit<00:03:37.489> more<00:03:37.700> hairspray<00:03:38.120> and

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
playing a little bit more hairspray and

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:52.479 
playing a little bit more hairspray and
that<00:03:39.019> is<00:03:39.200> the<00:03:39.349> finished<00:03:39.680> look<00:03:50.980> this<00:03:51.980> next<00:03:52.370> look

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
that is the finished look this next look

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.940 
that is the finished look this next look
is<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.329> simple<00:03:54.109> what<00:03:54.379> I'm<00:03:54.499> doing<00:03:54.799> is<00:03:54.919> just

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
is so simple what I'm doing is just

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.860 
is so simple what I'm doing is just
taking<00:03:55.310> some<00:03:55.669> front<00:03:55.909> pieces<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.450> basically

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
taking some front pieces and basically

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.629 
taking some front pieces and basically
just<00:03:57.109> braiding<00:03:57.500> them<00:03:57.650> back<00:03:57.859> but<00:03:58.400> I'm<00:03:58.519> just

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
just braiding them back but I'm just

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.399 
just braiding them back but I'm just
making<00:03:58.790> sure<00:03:59.030> that<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.659> can't<00:03:59.870> see<00:04:00.049> my<00:04:00.200> ears

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:00.409 
making sure that you can't see my ears

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:01.899 
making sure that you can't see my ears
because<00:04:00.769> I<00:04:00.889> think<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.069> looks<00:04:01.370> a<00:04:01.519> little<00:04:01.700> bit

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:01.909 
because I think that looks a little bit

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:04.300 
because I think that looks a little bit
weird<00:04:02.150> so<00:04:02.750> yeah<00:04:02.900> I'm<00:04:03.049> just<00:04:03.199> taking<00:04:03.560> a<00:04:03.799> piece<00:04:04.069> on

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
weird so yeah I'm just taking a piece on

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.500 
weird so yeah I'm just taking a piece on
at<00:04:04.519> this<00:04:04.639> side<00:04:04.909> and<00:04:05.150> I'm<00:04:05.209> going<00:04:05.359> to<00:04:05.449> be

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
at this side and I'm going to be

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.300 
at this side and I'm going to be
braiding<00:04:05.870> it<00:04:05.989> back<00:04:06.290> and<00:04:06.590> then<00:04:06.799> securing<00:04:07.219> it

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
braiding it back and then securing it

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.069 
braiding it back and then securing it
with<00:04:07.340> a<00:04:07.489> hair<00:04:07.639> tie<00:04:07.669> it<00:04:07.909> for<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.359> meantime<00:04:08.569> and

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
with a hair tie it for the meantime and

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:10.750 
with a hair tie it for the meantime and
then<00:04:09.650> I'm<00:04:09.739> pretty<00:04:10.099> much<00:04:10.250> just<00:04:10.310> doing<00:04:10.669> the

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 
then I'm pretty much just doing the

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.670 
then I'm pretty much just doing the
exact<00:04:11.090> same<00:04:11.180> thing<00:04:11.540> on<00:04:11.719> the<00:04:11.840> other<00:04:11.870> side<00:04:12.349> and

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
exact same thing on the other side and

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.670 
exact same thing on the other side and
I'm<00:04:13.219> just<00:04:13.400> going<00:04:13.639> to<00:04:14.030> connect<00:04:14.750> these<00:04:15.079> two<00:04:15.139> at

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
I'm just going to connect these two at

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.379 
I'm just going to connect these two at
the<00:04:15.859> back<00:04:16.039> and<00:04:16.370> secure<00:04:16.489> it<00:04:16.759> with<00:04:16.849> a<00:04:16.910> hair<00:04:17.150> tie

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:17.389 
the back and secure it with a hair tie

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:19.960 
the back and secure it with a hair tie
and<00:04:17.630> I<00:04:18.019> love<00:04:18.259> this<00:04:18.470> it's<00:04:18.769> so<00:04:19.340> good<00:04:19.549> for<00:04:19.609> work

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
and I love this it's so good for work

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.370 
and I love this it's so good for work
and<00:04:20.180> stuff<00:04:20.389> because<00:04:20.539> it<00:04:20.750> just<00:04:20.840> gets<00:04:21.049> the<00:04:21.169> hair

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
and stuff because it just gets the hair

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:23.200 
and stuff because it just gets the hair
out<00:04:21.560> of<00:04:21.590> your<00:04:21.739> face<00:04:21.829> but<00:04:22.340> you<00:04:22.430> can<00:04:22.580> still<00:04:22.820> wear

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
out of your face but you can still wear

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.240 
out of your face but you can still wear
it<00:04:23.240> down<00:04:24.050> so<00:04:24.349> it<00:04:24.440> still<00:04:24.650> looks<00:04:24.800> nice<00:04:25.009> and

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
it down so it still looks nice and

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:33.750 
it down so it still looks nice and
pretty<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:25.789> that<00:04:26.330> is<00:04:26.449> the<00:04:26.570> finished<00:04:26.870> look

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.450 

this<00:04:34.330> next<00:04:34.600> look<00:04:34.750> is<00:04:34.960> also<00:04:35.260> very<00:04:35.860> similar<00:04:36.190> I

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:36.460 
this next look is also very similar I

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:38.310 
this next look is also very similar I
forgot<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.060> actually<00:04:37.210> film<00:04:37.690> it<00:04:37.810> but<00:04:38.170> basically

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
forgot to actually film it but basically

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.530 
forgot to actually film it but basically
all<00:04:38.590> I<00:04:38.740> did<00:04:38.860> is<00:04:39.190> took<00:04:39.430> the<00:04:39.580> top<00:04:40.000> half<00:04:40.240> of<00:04:40.480> my

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
all I did is took the top half of my

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.590 
all I did is took the top half of my
hair<00:04:40.900> and<00:04:41.110> put<00:04:41.890> it<00:04:41.980> up<00:04:42.100> into<00:04:42.370> this<00:04:42.760> ponytail

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
hair and put it up into this ponytail

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.420 
hair and put it up into this ponytail
but<00:04:43.840> then<00:04:44.020> at<00:04:44.230> the<00:04:44.260> end<00:04:44.380> I<00:04:44.740> only<00:04:44.920> pulled<00:04:45.280> it

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
but then at the end I only pulled it

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.340 
but then at the end I only pulled it
through<00:04:45.460> halfway<00:04:46.030> if<00:04:46.450> that<00:04:46.630> makes<00:04:46.840> sense<00:04:46.960> and

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
through halfway if that makes sense and

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.440 
through halfway if that makes sense and
then<00:04:47.890> I'm<00:04:48.010> just<00:04:48.220> messing<00:04:48.700> it<00:04:48.820> up<00:04:49.000> so<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.390> looks

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
then I'm just messing it up so it looks

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:51.720

really<00:04:49.750> messy<00:04:49.990> and<00:04:50.380> I'm<00:04:50.800> taking<00:04:51.190> a<00:04:51.310> couple<00:04:51.640> of
