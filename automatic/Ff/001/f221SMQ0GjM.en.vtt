00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
doing in the next week as we r heat

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.490 
doing in the next week as we r heat
extracting<00:00:08.519> and<00:00:08.990> tinkering<00:00:09.990> at<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> same

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
extracting and tinkering at the same

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.129 
extracting and tinkering at the same
time<00:00:10.740> these<00:00:11.010> herbs<00:00:11.280> on<00:00:12.000> these<00:00:12.330> chinese<00:00:12.900> one's

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
time these herbs on these chinese one's

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.970 
time these herbs on these chinese one's
easier<00:00:13.530> for<00:00:14.480> these<00:00:15.480> are<00:00:15.690> for<00:00:15.900> bum<00:00:16.320> robert

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
easier for these are for bum robert

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.210 
easier for these are for bum robert
there<00:00:18.260> there<00:00:19.260> i<00:00:19.289> think<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.619> heat<00:00:19.830> extraction

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
there there i think the heat extraction

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.340 
there there i think the heat extraction
herbs<00:00:20.550> but<00:00:20.789> they're<00:00:20.970> on<00:00:21.029> this<00:00:21.240> just<00:00:22.109> like

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
heat extraction which i have i watch

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.790 
heat extraction which i have i watch
stuff<00:00:33.000> like<00:00:33.239> this<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.260> said<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.590> turn

that<00:00:53.190> time<00:00:53.430> seems<00:00:53.879> very<00:00:54.149> wicked<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.750> me<00:00:54.870> even

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
that time seems very wicked to me even

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.459 
that time seems very wicked to me even
though<00:00:55.140> if<00:00:56.570> one<00:00:57.570> of<00:00:57.660> them<00:00:57.780> heard<00:00:57.960> me<00:00:58.079> say<00:00:58.289> that

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
though if one of them heard me say that

though if one of them heard me say that
they're<00:00:58.649> probably<00:00:58.920> consider<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.520> quite

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
they're probably consider that quite

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.119 
they're probably consider that quite
blasphemous<00:01:00.420> but<00:01:01.020> anyways<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.890> what<00:01:02.039> I'm

saying is um she's talking about these

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.950 
saying is um she's talking about these
extractions<00:01:04.890> they're<00:01:05.100> being<00:01:05.309> done<00:01:05.720> she<00:01:06.720> turns

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
tomorrow the ones that are in the copper

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.149 
tomorrow the ones that are in the copper
caps<00:01:17.490> easily<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:18.390> seizure<00:01:18.600> Roberts<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.290> so

caps easily and seizure Roberts and so

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.380 
caps easily and seizure Roberts and so
um<00:01:21.860> the<00:01:22.860> heat<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.400> heat<00:01:23.430> thing<00:01:23.820> goes<00:01:24.030> off<00:01:24.150> in

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
um the heat the heat thing goes off in

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.660 
um the heat the heat thing goes off in
the<00:01:24.509> night<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.080> comes<00:01:25.290> back<00:01:25.380> on<00:01:25.770> because

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the night and then comes back on because

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.179 
the night and then comes back on because
until<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.960> I<00:01:28.049> haven't<00:01:28.290> seen<00:01:28.530> this<00:01:28.680> yet<00:01:28.740> on

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
until you and I haven't seen this yet on

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.190 
until you and I haven't seen this yet on
anywhere<00:01:29.820> life<00:01:30.090> that<00:01:30.479> I've<00:01:30.630> looked<00:01:30.930> about

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
anywhere life that I've looked about

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.190 
anywhere life that I've looked about
turning<00:01:31.979> meter<00:01:32.340> off<00:01:32.810> during<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> day<00:01:34.079> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
turning meter off during the day and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.380 
turning meter off during the day and
it's<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.680> think<00:01:35.340> ultimately<00:01:35.460> she<00:01:36.090> would<00:01:36.240> take

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
it's I think ultimately she would take

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.890 
it's I think ultimately she would take
some<00:01:36.659> of<00:01:36.750> these<00:01:37.070> super<00:01:38.070> powerful<00:01:38.400> ones

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
some of these super powerful ones

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.380 
some of these super powerful ones
and<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.770> keep<00:01:40.920> doing<00:01:41.220> this<00:01:41.340> but<00:01:41.520> anyways<00:01:41.910> so

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
and just keep doing this but anyways so

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.080 
and just keep doing this but anyways so
the<00:01:43.290> herb<00:01:43.440> contracts<00:01:44.010> when<00:01:44.340> it<00:01:44.430> cools<00:01:44.700> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
the herb contracts when it cools that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.030 
the herb contracts when it cools that
night<00:01:45.300> and<00:01:45.600> then<00:01:46.170> when<00:01:46.320> the<00:01:46.410> Sun<00:01:46.620> comes<00:01:46.830> up

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
night and then when the Sun comes up

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.470 
night and then when the Sun comes up
then<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.370> turn<00:01:47.550> the<00:01:47.670> heater<00:01:47.850> back<00:01:48.030> on<00:01:48.270> in<00:01:48.450> the

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:48.480 
then you turn the heater back on in the

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.600 
then you turn the heater back on in the
herb<00:01:48.690> expands<00:01:49.140> and<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.160> there<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.430> have<00:01:50.460> the

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
herb expands and so there you have the

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.240 
herb expands and so there you have the
whole<00:01:51.110> yin<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.290> Yan<00:01:52.440> might<00:01:52.710> be<00:01:52.860> in<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.070> heat

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
whole yin and Yan might be in the heat

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.470 
whole yin and Yan might be in the heat
extraction<00:01:53.720> but<00:01:54.720> um<00:01:55.700> you<00:01:56.700> know<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.180> anyways

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.230 
or just trying to find like setting more
of<00:03:47.440> a<00:03:47.500> realistic<00:03:47.860> goal<00:03:48.100> of<00:03:48.460> looking<00:03:48.790> into<00:03:49.090> the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:49.240 
of a realistic goal of looking into the

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:51.780 
of a realistic goal of looking into the
history<00:03:49.960> and<00:03:50.050> science<00:03:50.320> between<00:03:50.770> behind<00:03:51.640> a

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
history and science between behind a

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.380 
history and science between behind a
herb<00:03:51.940> like<00:03:52.650> like<00:03:53.650> two<00:03:54.460> or<00:03:54.700> three<00:03:54.730> a<00:03:55.000> day<00:03:55.060> on

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
herb like like two or three a day on

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:56.970 
herb like like two or three a day on
i'll<00:03:55.630> make<00:03:55.780> a<00:03:55.810> decision<00:03:56.320> i'll<00:03:56.470> start<00:03:56.710> three

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
i'll make a decision i'll start three

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.670 
i'll make a decision i'll start three
hours<00:03:57.310> have<00:03:57.700> a<00:03:57.730> tendency<00:03:58.270> to<00:03:58.300> set<00:03:58.570> us<00:03:59.320> at<00:03:59.500> high

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
hours have a tendency to set us at high

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.520 
hours have a tendency to set us at high
so<00:04:00.610> like<00:04:01.540> I've<00:04:01.690> been<00:04:01.720> telling<00:04:02.110> you<00:04:02.140> I'm<00:04:02.320> not

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:02.530 
so like I've been telling you I'm not

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:04.230 
so like I've been telling you I'm not
like<00:04:02.710> I<00:04:02.740> don't<00:04:02.950> retain<00:04:03.460> a<00:04:03.520> lot<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:03.910> that<00:04:04.030> like<00:04:04.210> I

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:04.240 
like I don't retain a lot of that like I

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:06.180 
like I don't retain a lot of that like I
just<00:04:04.390> wind<00:04:05.080> up<00:04:05.170> reading<00:04:05.470> about<00:04:05.620> something<00:04:06.070> and

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
just wind up reading about something and

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.040 
just wind up reading about something and
then<00:04:06.310> I<00:04:06.400> I<00:04:06.700> know<00:04:06.970> something's<00:04:07.480> important<00:04:07.930> and

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:08.050 
then I I know something's important and

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:10.500 
then I I know something's important and
then<00:04:08.170> I<00:04:08.230> sort<00:04:08.800> of<00:04:08.860> forget<00:04:09.130> it<00:04:09.280> so<00:04:09.489> now<00:04:10.180> I<00:04:10.209> guess

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:10.510 
then I sort of forget it so now I guess

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:12.360 
then I sort of forget it so now I guess
it<00:04:10.690> looks<00:04:10.720> like<00:04:11.050> the<00:04:11.530> universe<00:04:11.860> is<00:04:11.890> steering

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
it looks like the universe is steering

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.960 
it looks like the universe is steering
me<00:04:12.489> in<00:04:12.610> a<00:04:12.670> direction<00:04:12.790> where<00:04:14.489> who<00:04:15.489> knows<00:04:15.670> I<00:04:15.820> can

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
me in a direction where who knows I can

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:17.580 
me in a direction where who knows I can
wind<00:04:16.150> up<00:04:16.270> becoming<00:04:16.419> a<00:04:16.720> health<00:04:16.900> practitioner<00:04:17.109> I

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:17.590 
wind up becoming a health practitioner I

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.620 
wind up becoming a health practitioner I
don't<00:04:17.770> know<00:04:17.859> I'm<00:04:18.430> not<00:04:18.640> closing<00:04:18.910> any<00:04:19.150> doors<00:04:19.239> I
