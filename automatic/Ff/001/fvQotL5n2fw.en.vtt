00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
feel like that's not a lot of pressure

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.149 
feel like that's not a lot of pressure

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.830 
on my back I just felt like I just need
to<00:01:55.219> follow<00:01:55.369> the<00:01:55.579> road<00:01:55.759> that<00:01:55.999> he's<00:01:56.149> paid<00:01:56.450> for<00:01:56.780> it
