walls of your painted surfaces if you

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.840 
walls of your painted surfaces if you
don't<00:00:54.930> like<00:00:55.110> using<00:00:55.320> chemicals<00:00:56.039> another<00:00:56.640> way

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
don't like using chemicals another way

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.119 
don't like using chemicals another way
to<00:00:56.910> get<00:00:57.420> that<00:00:57.600> paint<00:00:57.960> off<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.440> just<00:00:58.739> to<00:00:58.920> take<00:00:59.100> a

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
to get that paint off is just to take a

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.800 
to get that paint off is just to take a
razor<00:00:59.430> blade<00:00:59.670> and<00:01:00.739> gently<00:01:01.739> scrape<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.579> paint

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.550 

until<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.020> comes<00:01:07.290> right<00:01:07.650> off<00:01:09.500> now<00:01:10.500> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
until that comes right off now you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.440 
until that comes right off now you
probably<00:01:11.070> don't<00:01:11.580> want<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.880> use<00:01:11.939> lacquer

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
probably don't want to use lacquer

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.200 
probably don't want to use lacquer
thinner<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:13.220> would<00:01:14.220> work<00:01:14.460> because<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.060> will

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
thinner on would work because it will

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.230 
thinner on would work because it will
take<00:01:15.509> the<00:01:15.689> finish<00:01:16.049> off<00:01:16.580> so<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.700> just<00:01:17.970> want<00:01:18.180> to

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
take the finish off so you just want to

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.580 
take the finish off so you just want to
be<00:01:18.330> real<00:01:18.570> careful<00:01:18.600> with<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.259> you're

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
be real careful with what you're

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.830 
be real careful with what you're
actually<00:01:19.799> using<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.640> on<00:01:22.009> the<00:01:23.009> next<00:01:23.189> way<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
actually using this on the next way to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.020 
actually using this on the next way to
make<00:01:24.840> our<00:01:25.049> bathroom<00:01:25.860> would<00:01:26.100> work<00:01:26.310> look<00:01:26.909> a
