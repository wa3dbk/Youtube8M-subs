start<00:01:34.790> there<00:01:35.030> I<00:01:35.210> know<00:01:35.840> a<00:01:35.960> lot<00:01:36.170> of<00:01:36.290> parallels

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
start there I know a lot of parallels

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.900 
start there I know a lot of parallels
that<00:01:37.400> I<00:01:37.430> do

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:37.910 
that I do

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.820 
that I do
I<00:01:37.940> could<00:01:38.450> start<00:01:38.720> them<00:01:38.930> on<00:01:39.080> that<00:01:39.230> very<00:01:39.560> easily

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
I could start them on that very easily

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.590 
I could start them on that very easily
and<00:01:40.250> they'd<00:01:40.640> be<00:01:40.700> very<00:01:40.820> comfortable<00:01:41.360> to<00:01:41.570> use

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
and they'd be very comfortable to use

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.960 
and they'd be very comfortable to use

the tungsten carbide coating on this

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.610 
the tungsten carbide coating on this
knife<00:01:44.180> is<00:01:44.390> one<00:01:44.570> of<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.750> best<00:01:44.960> coatings<00:01:45.410> on<00:01:45.530> the

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:45.620 
knife is one of the best coatings on the

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.710 
knife is one of the best coatings on the
market<00:01:45.950> that<00:01:46.040> I've<00:01:46.190> used<00:01:46.460> I<00:01:46.760> put<00:01:47.360> this<00:01:47.480> knife

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
market that I've used I put this knife

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.960 
market that I've used I put this knife
through<00:01:47.900> its<00:01:47.990> paces<00:01:48.200> gutting<00:01:48.770> fish

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
through its paces gutting fish

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.340 
through its paces gutting fish
processing<00:01:49.970> wood<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.480> taking<00:01:51.170> it<00:01:51.260> on

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
processing wood and taking it on

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:53.530 
processing wood and taking it on
backpacking<00:01:51.980> trips<00:01:52.250> and<00:01:52.490> it's<00:01:53.180> come<00:01:53.510> through

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
backpacking trips and it's come through

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.590 
backpacking trips and it's come through
for<00:01:53.990> me<00:01:54.170> it<00:01:54.920> almost<00:01:55.250> has<00:01:55.520> a<00:01:55.550> slicker<00:01:56.120> filling

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
for me it almost has a slicker filling

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.540 
for me it almost has a slicker filling
to<00:01:56.810> it<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.470> it<00:01:57.560> makes<00:01:57.680> it<00:01:57.830> very<00:01:57.890> easy<00:01:58.160> to<00:01:58.370> get

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
to it so it makes it very easy to get

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.540 
to it so it makes it very easy to get
through<00:01:58.760> sappy<00:01:59.240> wood<00:01:59.390> like<00:01:59.630> pine<00:02:00.220> one<00:02:01.220> thing<00:02:01.430> I

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
through sappy wood like pine one thing I

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:03.160 
through sappy wood like pine one thing I
will<00:02:01.760> say<00:02:01.790> about<00:02:02.150> the<00:02:02.330> coating<00:02:02.720> it<00:02:02.840> makes<00:02:03.020> it

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
will say about the coating it makes it

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.200 
will say about the coating it makes it
very<00:02:03.320> difficult<00:02:03.710> to<00:02:04.130> strike<00:02:04.340> a<00:02:04.400> fire<00:02:04.730> still<00:02:05.030> on

very difficult to strike a fire still on
it<00:02:05.390> so<00:02:06.110> be<00:02:06.260> aware<00:02:06.350> of<00:02:06.560> that<00:02:06.800> I<00:02:07.010> ended<00:02:07.550> up<00:02:07.760> going

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
it so be aware of that I ended up going

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.400 
it so be aware of that I ended up going
to<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.330> jumping<00:02:08.690> part<00:02:08.929> of<00:02:09.019> the<00:02:09.080> knife<00:02:09.259> and

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 
to the jumping part of the knife and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.320 
to the jumping part of the knife and
using<00:02:09.649> that<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.830> strike<00:02:10.310> and<00:02:10.880> that<00:02:11.030> seemed<00:02:11.240> to

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
using that to strike and that seemed to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.840 
using that to strike and that seemed to
work<00:02:11.360> pretty<00:02:11.480> well<00:02:11.930> a<00:02:12.280> lot<00:02:13.280> of<00:02:13.310> people<00:02:13.700> in<00:02:13.760> the
