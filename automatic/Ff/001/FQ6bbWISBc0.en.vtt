00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.680 
see that it has pretty good damage 49
damage<00:02:21.290> up<00:02:21.440> close<00:02:21.769> and<00:02:22.010> it<00:02:22.430> drops<00:02:22.700> down<00:02:22.820> to<00:02:22.970> 25

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
damage up close and it drops down to 25

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.810 
damage up close and it drops down to 25
damage<00:02:24.079> now<00:02:24.260> when<00:02:24.560> does<00:02:24.739> that<00:02:24.920> occur<00:02:25.310> alright

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
damage now when does that occur alright

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.610 
damage now when does that occur alright
if<00:02:25.940> you<00:02:26.030> go<00:02:26.209> over<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.359> the<00:02:26.660> blue<00:02:26.959> column<00:02:27.410> you'll

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
if you go over to the blue column you'll

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.910 
if you go over to the blue column you'll
see<00:02:27.829> that<00:02:27.950> up<00:02:28.160> to<00:02:28.959> 1090<00:02:29.959> units<00:02:30.380> it's<00:02:30.590> going<00:02:30.859> to

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
see that up to 1090 units it's going to

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.599 
see that up to 1090 units it's going to
do<00:02:31.070> that<00:02:31.250> 49<00:02:31.730> damage<00:02:32.329> per<00:02:32.900> bullet<00:02:33.410> now<00:02:34.310> from

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
do that 49 damage per bullet now from

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:37.509 
do that 49 damage per bullet now from
the<00:02:34.730> 1090<00:02:35.329> to<00:02:35.510> the<00:02:35.650> 1675<00:02:36.650> that's<00:02:37.070> where<00:02:37.370> the

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
the 1090 to the 1675 that's where the

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:40.240 
the 1090 to the 1675 that's where the
actual<00:02:37.760> damage<00:02:38.209> starts<00:02:38.660> dropping<00:02:39.170> off<00:02:39.620> and<00:02:40.100> so

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
actual damage starts dropping off and so

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.090 
actual damage starts dropping off and so
when<00:02:40.400> it<00:02:40.489> gets<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.959> 1675<00:02:41.959> it's<00:02:42.590> only<00:02:42.920> going<00:02:43.040> to

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:43.100 
when it gets to 1675 it's only going to

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.640 
when it gets to 1675 it's only going to
be<00:02:43.250> doing<00:02:43.400> that<00:02:43.700> 25<00:02:44.299> damage<00:02:44.690> from<00:02:44.959> there<00:02:45.410> on

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
be doing that 25 damage from there on

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.650 
be doing that 25 damage from there on
out<00:02:45.680> all<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.190> way<00:02:46.400> across<00:02:46.519> the<00:02:46.850> map<00:02:47.329> you<00:02:47.359> know

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
out all the way across the map you know

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.330 
out all the way across the map you know
the<00:02:47.810> bullets<00:02:48.049> never<00:02:48.380> disappear<00:02:48.980> or<00:02:49.069> anything

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
the bullets never disappear or anything

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.819 
the bullets never disappear or anything
like<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:49.549> so<00:02:49.970> if<00:02:50.209> you<00:02:50.660> look<00:02:50.930> at<00:02:51.049> that<00:02:51.230> 1090<00:02:51.739> in

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
like that so if you look at that 1090 in

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:54.520 
like that so if you look at that 1090 in
1675<00:02:52.640> halfway<00:02:53.540> in<00:02:53.780> between<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:54.290> range

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
1675 halfway in between that range

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.050 
1675 halfway in between that range
you're<00:02:54.890> going<00:02:55.010> to<00:02:55.069> get<00:02:55.190> halfway<00:02:55.579> in<00:02:56.030> between

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
you're going to get halfway in between

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.080 
you're going to get halfway in between
that<00:02:56.600> damage<00:02:57.109> range<00:02:57.350> of<00:02:57.560> that<00:02:57.680> 49<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.400> 25<00:02:58.880> so

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
that damage range of that 49 and 25 so

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.610 
that damage range of that 49 and 25 so
keep<00:02:59.269> in<00:02:59.390> mind<00:02:59.600> it<00:02:59.720> just<00:02:59.780> kind<00:03:00.079> of<00:03:00.109> literally

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
keep in mind it just kind of literally

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.069 
keep in mind it just kind of literally
drops<00:03:01.519> off<00:03:01.790> until<00:03:02.180> up<00:03:02.359> until<00:03:02.630> the<00:03:02.750> point<00:03:02.900> and

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
drops off until up until the point and

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.590 
drops off until up until the point and
then<00:03:03.199> go<00:03:03.380> straight<00:03:03.650> on<00:03:03.889> with<00:03:04.070> that<00:03:04.190> 25<00:03:04.760> now<00:03:05.389> in

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
then go straight on with that 25 now in

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.280 
then go straight on with that 25 now in
the<00:03:05.720> next

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
the next

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.140 
the next
last<00:03:06.530> column<00:03:06.920> in<00:03:07.040> that<00:03:07.189> red<00:03:07.400> section<00:03:07.670> there<00:03:08.000> is

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
last column in that red section there is

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.940 
last column in that red section there is
a<00:03:08.180> headshot<00:03:08.689> multiplier<00:03:08.870> obviously<00:03:09.739> if<00:03:09.860> you

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
the ak-12 it's going to do 49 damage x

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.809 
the ak-12 it's going to do 49 damage x
1.4<00:03:15.260> whatever<00:03:15.709> that<00:03:16.040> is<00:03:16.250> I<00:03:16.280> don't<00:03:16.519> know<00:03:16.670> maybe

fire type so say for instance the ak-12

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.020 
fire type so say for instance the ak-12
as<00:03:30.590> soon<00:03:30.890> as<00:03:31.010> you<00:03:31.129> add<00:03:31.220> the<00:03:31.340> attachment<00:03:31.879> and

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
as soon as you add the attachment and

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.339 
as soon as you add the attachment and
change<00:03:32.269> it<00:03:32.389> from<00:03:32.480> a<00:03:32.629> full<00:03:32.840> auto<00:03:33.049> to<00:03:33.319> a

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:33.349 
change it from a full auto to a

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.410 
change it from a full auto to a
semi-automatic<00:03:34.099> weapon<00:03:34.519> it<00:03:34.639> changes<00:03:35.090> a<00:03:35.150> lot

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:35.420 
semi-automatic weapon it changes a lot

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.479 
semi-automatic weapon it changes a lot
of<00:03:35.480> the<00:03:35.750> characteristics<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.950> damage<00:03:37.280> goes

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
of the characteristics the damage goes

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:40.089 
of the characteristics the damage goes
up<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:38.120> fire<00:03:38.329> rate<00:03:38.569> obviously<00:03:39.260> goes<00:03:39.560> down<00:03:39.859> so

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 
up the fire rate obviously goes down so

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:42.069 
up the fire rate obviously goes down so
just<00:03:40.250> keep<00:03:40.549> that<00:03:40.609> in<00:03:40.819> mind<00:03:41.060> I<00:03:41.209> do<00:03:41.269> not<00:03:41.599> have<00:03:41.810> all

MSBs that the first three rounds that

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:03.550 
MSBs that the first three rounds that

come out of this weapon come out super

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.379 
come out of this weapon come out super
fast<00:04:03.590> up<00:04:04.040> in<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:04.370> 800<00:04:04.849> rounds<00:04:05.000> per<00:04:05.269> minute

fast up in the 800 rounds per minute

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.149 
fast up in the 800 rounds per minute
mark<00:04:05.689> but<00:04:06.200> by<00:04:06.409> the<00:04:06.470> time<00:04:06.530> you<00:04:06.829> pull<00:04:07.069> the

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 
mark but by the time you pull the

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:08.830 
mark but by the time you pull the
trigger<00:04:07.310> wait<00:04:07.790> for<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.090> trigger<00:04:08.299> delay<00:04:08.599> and

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
trigger wait for the trigger delay and

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.689 
trigger wait for the trigger delay and
pull<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.139> trigger<00:04:09.169> again<00:04:09.680> that<00:04:10.159> brings<00:04:10.489> that

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:10.699 
pull the trigger again that brings that

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:12.909 
pull the trigger again that brings that
average<00:04:11.209> speed<00:04:11.510> way<00:04:12.049> down<00:04:12.349> so<00:04:12.590> that's<00:04:12.709> why

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:12.919 
average speed way down so that's why

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:15.099 
average speed way down so that's why
that<00:04:13.099> number<00:04:13.310> is<00:04:13.639> so<00:04:13.970> low<00:04:14.329> but<00:04:14.690> I<00:04:14.720> want<00:04:14.959> to<00:04:14.989> move

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
that number is so low but I want to move

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:16.479 
that number is so low but I want to move
on<00:04:15.229> to<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.560> last<00:04:15.739> two<00:04:15.919> columns<00:04:16.130> in<00:04:16.370> this

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
on to the last two columns in this

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.580 
on to the last two columns in this
category<00:04:16.789> time<00:04:17.449> to<00:04:17.599> kill<00:04:17.750> minimum<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:18.409> time

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:18.590 
category time to kill minimum and time

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.289 
category time to kill minimum and time
to<00:04:18.709> kill<00:04:18.859> maximum<00:04:19.340> these<00:04:19.789> are<00:04:19.970> numbers<00:04:20.120> that

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
to kill maximum these are numbers that

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.420 
to kill maximum these are numbers that
if<00:04:20.659> you<00:04:20.840> were<00:04:20.959> to<00:04:21.019> shoot<00:04:21.349> somebody<00:04:21.680> this<00:04:22.220> is

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
if you were to shoot somebody this is

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.890 
if you were to shoot somebody this is
how<00:04:22.610> long<00:04:22.820> it's<00:04:23.000> going<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.240> take<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.720> actually

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
how long it's going to take to actually

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.680 
how long it's going to take to actually
drop<00:04:24.590> them<00:04:24.979> so<00:04:25.669> that<00:04:25.880> first<00:04:25.909> number<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.539> you

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:26.690 
drop them so that first number that you

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.320 
drop them so that first number that you
see<00:04:26.720> there<00:04:27.139> is<00:04:27.349> at<00:04:27.680> its<00:04:27.949> best<00:04:28.130> range<00:04:28.849> with<00:04:29.120> its

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
see there is at its best range with its

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.390 
see there is at its best range with its
best<00:04:29.630> damage<00:04:30.050> and<00:04:30.260> that<00:04:30.349> second<00:04:30.770> number<00:04:30.949> is<00:04:31.130> at

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
best damage and that second number is at

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.760 
best damage and that second number is at
is<00:04:31.639> worse<00:04:32.000> stranger<00:04:32.570> with<00:04:32.750> its<00:04:32.990> worst<00:04:33.380> damage

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
is worse stranger with its worst damage

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.320 
is worse stranger with its worst damage
so<00:04:34.039> you<00:04:34.130> can<00:04:34.250> see<00:04:34.400> that<00:04:34.430> how<00:04:34.760> that<00:04:34.789> drops<00:04:35.210> down

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
so you can see that how that drops down

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.750 
so you can see that how that drops down
now<00:04:36.080> it<00:04:36.409> would<00:04:36.530> appear<00:04:36.560> that<00:04:36.860> the<00:04:37.099> f<00:04:37.220> ad<00:04:37.400> would

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
now it would appear that the f ad would

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.610 
now it would appear that the f ad would
be<00:04:37.880> a<00:04:37.909> better<00:04:38.180> weapon<00:04:38.449> compared<00:04:39.080> to<00:04:39.289> like<00:04:39.440> the

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
be a better weapon compared to like the

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.230 
be a better weapon compared to like the
Remington<00:04:40.159> even<00:04:40.400> though<00:04:40.520> the<00:04:40.639> Remington<00:04:41.060> is

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
Remington even though the Remington is

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.930 
Remington even though the Remington is
higher<00:04:41.510> damage<00:04:41.780> but<00:04:42.470> this<00:04:42.830> does<00:04:43.130> not<00:04:43.159> consider

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
higher damage but this does not consider

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.330 
higher damage but this does not consider
range<00:04:44.570> as<00:04:44.930> soon<00:04:45.229> as<00:04:45.349> you<00:04:45.470> start<00:04:45.770> moving<00:04:45.949> out

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
range as soon as you start moving out

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.089 
range as soon as you start moving out
from<00:04:46.550> that<00:04:46.699> 650<00:04:47.419> range<00:04:47.659> with<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:47.900> f<00:04:48.110> ad<00:04:48.349> the

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099 
from that 650 range with the f ad the

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.950 
from that 650 range with the f ad the
bullets<00:04:49.520> on<00:04:49.729> that<00:04:49.940> weapons<00:04:50.300> start<00:04:50.510> getting<00:04:50.840> a

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
bullets on that weapons start getting a

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.050 
bullets on that weapons start getting a
lot<00:04:51.289> weaker<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:51.979> it<00:04:52.130> takes<00:04:52.430> longer<00:04:52.820> to

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
lot weaker and it takes longer to

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.850 
lot weaker and it takes longer to
actually<00:04:53.389> drop<00:04:53.630> somebody<00:04:53.930> whereas<00:04:54.409> with<00:04:54.710> the

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
actually drop somebody whereas with the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.040 
actually drop somebody whereas with the
Remington<00:04:55.370> you've<00:04:55.820> got<00:04:56.090> that<00:04:56.270> nice<00:04:56.570> strong

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
Remington you've got that nice strong

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.439 
Remington you've got that nice strong
number<00:04:57.500> that<00:04:57.710> nice<00:04:57.949> strong<00:04:58.280> time<00:04:58.849> to<00:04:59.030> kill<00:04:59.240> up

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
number that nice strong time to kill up

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.089 
number that nice strong time to kill up
until<00:04:59.750> twelve<00:05:00.169> hundred<00:05:00.380> and<00:05:00.710> eighty<00:05:00.889> five

00:05:01.089 --> 00:05:01.099 
until twelve hundred and eighty five

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:02.680 
until twelve hundred and eighty five
units<00:05:01.490> so<00:05:01.669> you<00:05:01.729> have<00:05:02.150> to<00:05:02.330> take<00:05:02.539> into

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
units so you have to take into

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.439 
units so you have to take into
consideration<00:05:03.650> the<00:05:03.860> range<00:05:04.610> at<00:05:04.909> which<00:05:05.150> these

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:05.449 
consideration the range at which these

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.420 
consideration the range at which these
guns<00:05:05.780> are<00:05:05.960> firing<00:05:06.199> in<00:05:06.530> the<00:05:06.620> targets<00:05:07.039> that<00:05:07.190> you

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 
guns are firing in the targets that you

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.939 
guns are firing in the targets that you
are<00:05:07.639> shooting<00:05:07.970> now<00:05:08.810> speaking<00:05:09.139> of<00:05:09.440> range<00:05:09.770> we

00:05:09.939 --> 00:05:09.949 
are shooting now speaking of range we

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:11.620 
are shooting now speaking of range we
already<00:05:10.159> kind<00:05:10.310> of<00:05:10.430> talked<00:05:10.849> about<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.330> range

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
already kind of talked about the range

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.779 
already kind of talked about the range
drop<00:05:12.080> off<00:05:12.320> start<00:05:12.710> and<00:05:13.009> the<00:05:13.070> range<00:05:13.250> drop<00:05:13.580> off

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
drop off start and the range drop off

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:15.580 
drop off start and the range drop off
end<00:05:14.060> but<00:05:14.270> once<00:05:14.539> again<00:05:14.719> you<00:05:15.020> know<00:05:15.110> that<00:05:15.260> first

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:15.590 
end but once again you know that first

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.159 
end but once again you know that first
number<00:05:15.950> is<00:05:16.130> the<00:05:16.190> range<00:05:17.029> at<00:05:17.240> which<00:05:17.389> it<00:05:17.599> does<00:05:17.810> max

00:05:18.159 --> 00:05:18.169 
number is the range at which it does max

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:19.790 
number is the range at which it does max
damage<00:05:18.560> so<00:05:19.010> speaking<00:05:19.550> of

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800

three<00:06:24.150> bullets<00:06:24.779> now<00:06:24.990> the<00:06:25.050> thing<00:06:25.349> to<00:06:25.380> keep<00:06:25.620> in

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 
three bullets now the thing to keep in

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.279 
three bullets now the thing to keep in
mind<00:06:25.860> though<00:06:26.250> is<00:06:26.370> like<00:06:26.940> look<00:06:27.210> at<00:06:27.330> the<00:06:27.479> fa<00:06:27.870> d<00:06:27.930> it

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:28.289 
mind though is like look at the fa d it

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:29.659

bullets up until six hundred and fifty

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.439 
bullets up until six hundred and fifty
units<00:06:32.069> where<00:06:32.610> you<00:06:32.729> compare<00:06:32.849> that<00:06:33.090> to<00:06:33.240> the

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:33.449 
units where you compare that to the

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:35.240 
units where you compare that to the
Remington<00:06:33.930> and<00:06:34.110> that<00:06:34.319> thing<00:06:34.620> is<00:06:34.650> dropping

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
Remington and that thing is dropping

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.399 
Remington and that thing is dropping
people<00:06:35.430> at<00:06:35.699> seventeen<00:06:36.449> hundred<00:06:36.840> and<00:06:36.990> fifty

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409 
people at seventeen hundred and fifty

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:39.409 
people at seventeen hundred and fifty
eight<00:06:37.560> units<00:06:37.889> with<00:06:38.370> only<00:06:38.639> three<00:06:39.029> bullets<00:06:39.330> so

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:39.419 
eight units with only three bullets so

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:40.820 
eight units with only three bullets so
that's<00:06:39.659> why<00:06:39.779> I<00:06:39.810> said<00:06:40.050> you<00:06:40.229> really<00:06:40.560> have<00:06:40.710> to

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
that's why I said you really have to

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:42.740 
that's why I said you really have to
take<00:06:41.069> into<00:06:41.219> consideration<00:06:42.090> the<00:06:42.120> range<00:06:42.569> that

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:42.750 
take into consideration the range that

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.629 
take into consideration the range that
it's<00:06:43.050> doing<00:06:43.349> these<00:06:43.440> damage<00:06:43.830> that<00:06:44.009> and<00:06:44.279> if<00:06:44.550> you

00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 
it's doing these damage that and if you

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:46.459 
it's doing these damage that and if you
want<00:06:44.789> to<00:06:44.849> see<00:06:45.000> how<00:06:45.240> that<00:06:45.449> range<00:06:45.840> kind<00:06:46.289> of

00:06:46.459 --> 00:06:46.469 
want to see how that range kind of

00:06:46.469 --> 00:06:48.830 
want to see how that range kind of
equates<00:06:47.190> to<00:06:47.340> in-game<00:06:47.729> look<00:06:48.330> at<00:06:48.419> that<00:06:48.569> map

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:48.840 
equates to in-game look at that map

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:50.749 
equates to in-game look at that map
below<00:06:49.139> that<00:06:49.349> there<00:06:49.560> is<00:06:49.680> a<00:06:49.710> map<00:06:49.979> of<00:06:50.009> strikes<00:06:50.610> on

00:06:50.749 --> 00:06:50.759 
below that there is a map of strikes on

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:53.749 
below that there is a map of strikes on
the<00:06:51.270> area<00:06:51.569> on<00:06:51.750> the<00:06:51.900> top<00:06:52.199> left<00:06:52.710> is<00:06:53.009> the<00:06:53.310> part

00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 
the area on the top left is the part

00:06:53.759 --> 00:06:55.879 
the area on the top left is the part
that's<00:06:53.819> open<00:06:54.449> with<00:06:54.599> the<00:06:54.690> statue<00:06:55.020> and<00:06:55.469> the<00:06:55.620> van

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
that's open with the statue and the van

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:59.240 
that's open with the statue and the van
and<00:06:56.219> each<00:06:56.789> of<00:06:56.969> those<00:06:57.090> big<00:06:57.509> squares<00:06:57.990> is<00:06:58.259> 500

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
and each of those big squares is 500

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.830 
and each of those big squares is 500
units<00:06:59.550> so<00:06:59.729> you<00:06:59.789> can<00:06:59.940> kind<00:07:00.150> of<00:07:00.210> see<00:07:00.449> the<00:07:00.599> range

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840 
units so you can kind of see the range

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.570 
units so you can kind of see the range
for<00:07:01.050> the<00:07:01.110> weapons<00:07:01.440> and<00:07:01.590> kind<00:07:02.219> of<00:07:02.370> get<00:07:02.550> a

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:02.580 
for the weapons and kind of get a

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:05.570 
for the weapons and kind of get a
feeling<00:07:02.940> for<00:07:03.090> how<00:07:03.300> far<00:07:03.629> that<00:07:04.349> is<00:07:04.680> now<00:07:04.979> the<00:07:05.009> area

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
feeling for how far that is now the area

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.129 
feeling for how far that is now the area
and<00:07:05.759> yellow<00:07:06.210> and<00:07:06.389> the<00:07:06.449> chart<00:07:06.690> that<00:07:06.870> is<00:07:06.990> the

00:07:07.129 --> 00:07:07.139 
and yellow and the chart that is the

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:08.930 
and yellow and the chart that is the
reload<00:07:07.529> characteristics<00:07:08.310> or<00:07:08.460> the<00:07:08.580> reload

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:08.940 
reload characteristics or the reload

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:11.809 
reload characteristics or the reload
times<00:07:09.180> that<00:07:09.779> is<00:07:09.930> pretty<00:07:10.110> self-explanatory<00:07:10.819> to

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 
times that is pretty self-explanatory to

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:13.730 
times that is pretty self-explanatory to
the<00:07:11.940> right<00:07:12.210> of<00:07:12.330> that<00:07:12.360> I've<00:07:12.659> got<00:07:12.900> recoil<00:07:13.529> plots

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:13.740 
the right of that I've got recoil plots

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.589 
the right of that I've got recoil plots
that's<00:07:14.310> when<00:07:14.490> you<00:07:14.580> pull<00:07:14.819> the<00:07:14.940> trigger<00:07:15.090> how<00:07:15.539> the

00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 
that's when you pull the trigger how the

00:07:15.599 --> 00:07:17.360 
that's when you pull the trigger how the
gun<00:07:16.020> is<00:07:16.139> going<00:07:16.319> to<00:07:16.379> jump<00:07:16.650> up<00:07:16.800> and<00:07:16.949> down<00:07:17.039> and

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:17.370 
gun is going to jump up and down and

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:18.769 
gun is going to jump up and down and
everything<00:07:17.580> like<00:07:17.879> that<00:07:17.940> now<00:07:18.389> keep<00:07:18.629> in<00:07:18.719> mind

00:07:18.769 --> 00:07:18.779 
everything like that now keep in mind

00:07:18.779 --> 00:07:20.959 
everything like that now keep in mind
though<00:07:19.110> that<00:07:19.289> is<00:07:19.889> normally<00:07:20.490> how<00:07:20.669> the<00:07:20.729> gun

00:07:20.959 --> 00:07:20.969 
though that is normally how the gun

00:07:20.969 --> 00:07:23.180 
though that is normally how the gun
shoots<00:07:21.270> if<00:07:21.479> you<00:07:21.659> add<00:07:21.870> a<00:07:21.900> grip<00:07:22.379> to<00:07:22.620> it<00:07:22.650> or<00:07:22.949> if<00:07:23.069> you

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.190 
shoots if you add a grip to it or if you

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:24.980 
shoots if you add a grip to it or if you
had<00:07:23.310> something<00:07:23.610> else<00:07:23.819> that<00:07:24.360> is<00:07:24.569> going<00:07:24.629> to

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:24.990 
had something else that is going to

00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:27.709 
had something else that is going to
change<00:07:25.319> the<00:07:25.740> recoil<00:07:26.340> plot<00:07:26.789> now<00:07:27.180> over<00:07:27.539> on<00:07:27.569> the

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:27.719 
change the recoil plot now over on the

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:29.480 
change the recoil plot now over on the
bottom<00:07:28.169> left<00:07:28.320> I've<00:07:28.500> got<00:07:28.649> a<00:07:28.680> few<00:07:28.919> notes<00:07:29.159> like<00:07:29.339> if

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:29.490 
bottom left I've got a few notes like if

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:31.279 
bottom left I've got a few notes like if
you<00:07:29.580> had<00:07:29.699> a<00:07:29.729> silencer<00:07:30.060> you're<00:07:30.899> going<00:07:31.020> to<00:07:31.080> lose

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:31.289 
you had a silencer you're going to lose

00:07:31.289 --> 00:07:33.140 
you had a silencer you're going to lose
twenty<00:07:31.830> five<00:07:32.039> percent<00:07:32.070> of<00:07:32.789> your

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.150 
twenty five percent of your

00:07:33.150 --> 00:07:35.480 
twenty five percent of your
range<00:07:33.300> because<00:07:34.140> of<00:07:34.260> that<00:07:34.410> silencer<00:07:35.040> whereas

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:35.490 
range because of that silencer whereas

00:07:35.490 --> 00:07:37.160 
range because of that silencer whereas
if<00:07:35.700> you<00:07:35.790> put<00:07:35.970> a<00:07:36.000> muzzle<00:07:36.330> brake<00:07:36.630> on<00:07:36.780> a<00:07:36.810> weapon

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:37.170 
if you put a muzzle brake on a weapon

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:39.230 
if you put a muzzle brake on a weapon
that<00:07:37.530> actually<00:07:37.590> adds<00:07:38.250> twenty<00:07:38.670> percent<00:07:39.000> to

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 
that actually adds twenty percent to

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:40.400 
that actually adds twenty percent to
your<00:07:39.360> range<00:07:39.510> so<00:07:39.720> make<00:07:39.900> sure<00:07:39.930> you<00:07:40.080> check<00:07:40.260> out

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:40.410 
your range so make sure you check out

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:41.870 
your range so make sure you check out
those<00:07:40.650> notes<00:07:40.950> I've<00:07:41.130> also<00:07:41.280> got<00:07:41.580> some<00:07:41.730> other

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:41.880 
those notes I've also got some other

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:43.430 
those notes I've also got some other
