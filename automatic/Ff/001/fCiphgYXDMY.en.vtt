00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 so hello everybody friends with you again me and 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.099
 today we will look again at 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.950
 someone's sleep card for a transformer so 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.830
 we have three such packs here 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.650
 they can't a little bit other little 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.650
 green medium red or even here 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:25.340
 I saw such a blue big and let's 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.689
 start again with the T-shirt itself chips 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:35.969
 let's call them pizza-flavored chips 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:39.739
 here is such a transformer and off-screen 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.739
 also the height of them so basically 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:54.649
 through this is just awesome 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:58.859
 we repeat such a bentley we had already 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.190
 in the previous issue, but there will be 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.149
 now 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:05.129
 code that I rather want from me 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.939
 while 10 points only on the site I want though 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.570
 would be 15 to the first first level of prizes 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.930
 in the first stage 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.860
 there is 15 points should be so focus here 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.990
 such a bentley 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.110
 and behind this is the code 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.869
 activated so you can not try 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:30.360
 so well let's unpack now the card 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:32.430
 which I have just eaten and the 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.770
 too profile photo 1 card three packs and 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:40.829
 here not at a time I can't eat i'm not in 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:45.240
 generally dry out without vacuum so next 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:48.390
 we have a card by the way transformer 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.430
 edge of extraction is just part 4 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.040
 Transformers which I did not see therefore 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.200
 I did not know that this film is exactly part 4 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.229
 I'm over 6 there era of extermination 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.490
 here but I just did not look though all three 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.969
 parts I looked at always very 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.880
 liked 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.439
 I had long since they are old as this 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.509
 series in principle in childhood 1 more I 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:06.940
 watched but I really transformers 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.869
 like 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.840
 so actually this is cool 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:19.180
 The thing here is written a transformer and she is 24 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.460
 with 26 here's a code card again 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:25.750
 you may not even try but 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:36.960
 the most annoying please your here 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:36.960
 not so and this is ours 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:48.450
 then it doesn’t look like optimus prime 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:57.270
 look i see it already optimus 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:59.500
 class it's cool so now wait a second 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:09.450
 not very convenient not open not 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:10.709
 surrounded it is not scary for us and 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:15.130
 take a look 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:17.320
 the second card of the series is the optimus 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.640
 prime and even written in english and in 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.459
 I like Russian when I write 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.970
 title in English and in Russian and here 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.450
 such code and let's go ahead open 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:30.310
 offscreen 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:40.180
 I have prepared a card for you 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:42.160
 look at it still open by the way 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.140
 this is a sticker that I remembered wanted to say 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.970
 still add light to fakie I didn't know everything 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:50.970
 it is written here because now 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.970
 will focus 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.920
 here is a looking picture sticker and 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:03.950
 cardboard card with a unique code 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:08.370
 there is this sticker so here is our next 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:10.860
 Bambolbi look Bambolbi and cool 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.410
 Generally it was 3 optimus was the second 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:15.560
 card this card is 3 bambolbs like this 

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.060
 he looks to give a little closer 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.459
 again the same code with the card code all 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.640
 see the same code 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:27.480
 but don't try and output it 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:31.410
 useless so already 2 open 2 2 2 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.260
 open pieces and generally spirals there 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:45.240
 will be . I have a huge spiral with Russia 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:46.800
 not I do not know that's now try and it 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.560
 here these spirals together with not very 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.100
 like know why niki if you eat 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:59.790
 lot 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:05:07.560
 they melt in your mouth right here the car became 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:12.360
 there again would not be turning some 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:15.419
 in a homogeneous mess in your mouth why not 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.680
 very damn there cards here to me 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.700
 why do you know it seems like to close 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.700
 cap should be 2 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:27.310
 but I just think 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.750
 this is the maximum number of points will be 

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:34.590
 so this card is not worth it 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.590
 supernatural something to wait from there 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:46.740
 so well and let's this little so 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:59.190
 let's open now 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:59.190
 what is it hard to open 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:17.670
 go ahead and we dug look I don't 

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:20.170
 I remember this probably we have 4 parts pure 

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:23.260
 it will be necessary to look later 

00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:25.150
 on the gun but I didn't get in; unfortunately I didn't 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:28.420
 I know he went out right now in rent or 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:31.200
 no, is it just possible to look here 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:35.770
 actually here and so our looks 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:38.380
 card number 17 and we still have 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:42.280
 Here I have the last third of the frame 3 

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:45.580
 voice-over, unfortunately, replay 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:50.830
 let's calmly look at the scoreboard first 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:54.840
 parts so it looks like this 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:58.780
 strife just the same 14 card code 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:03.250
 arranging and kicking up the code well and 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:05.950
 actually generally on this all all pitching 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:10.150
 showed but let me now you them 

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:12.550
 show more closer here so go ahead and 

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:15.670
 batches of today's cards look like 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:20.570
 actually here so i can even tell you 

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:27.509
 I can show everything closer 

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:29.009
 It looks like that's all principle 

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:31.500
 pretty beautiful cards I don’t 

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:34.320
 I can not like as much as I have them there 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:37.020
 but then we count the possibilities of general 

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:39.419
 here on this all thanks for all 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:41.900
 viewing put likes waiting for new videos and 

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:41.900
 bye everyone
