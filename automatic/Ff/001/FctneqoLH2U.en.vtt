because I hear that these shoes are

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.240 
because I hear that these shoes are
pretty<00:02:14.090> high<00:02:14.270> quality<00:02:14.320> so<00:02:15.320> basically<00:02:15.680> I<00:02:15.770> don't

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
pretty high quality so basically I don't

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.310 
pretty high quality so basically I don't
really<00:02:16.460> have<00:02:16.550> an<00:02:16.790> all<00:02:16.940> black<00:02:17.150> dress<00:02:17.540> formally

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320

really have an all black dress formally
type<00:02:18.680> shoes<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.160> picked<00:02:19.460> it<00:02:19.550> up<00:02:19.610> for<00:02:19.790> about

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
type shoes I picked it up for about

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.480 
type shoes I picked it up for about
twenty-four<00:02:20.360> dollars<00:02:20.830> which<00:02:21.830> i<00:02:22.070> think<00:02:22.130> is

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
twenty-four dollars which i think is

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.120 
twenty-four dollars which i think is
unreasonable<00:02:23.330> but<00:02:23.720> I<00:02:24.080> don't<00:02:24.470> argue<00:02:24.800> because

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
unreasonable but I don't argue because

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.850 
unreasonable but I don't argue because
well<00:02:25.580> Brandon<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:26.690> in<00:02:26.930> good<00:02:27.110> condition<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.590> I

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
well Brandon and in good condition so I

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.670 
well Brandon and in good condition so I
guess<00:02:28.100> that's<00:02:28.310> sort<00:02:28.580> of<00:02:28.700> worth<00:02:28.880> it<00:02:29.170> but<00:02:30.170> yeah

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680
