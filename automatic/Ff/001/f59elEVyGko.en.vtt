were<00:03:20.579> legitimized<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.569> we<00:03:21.690> could

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
were legitimized and that we could

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.720 
were legitimized and that we could
create<00:03:22.170> a<00:03:22.260> sport<00:03:22.620> out<00:03:22.799> of<00:03:22.860> it<00:03:23.040> and<00:03:23.190> so<00:03:23.549> it
