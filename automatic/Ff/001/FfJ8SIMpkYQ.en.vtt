a couple of months ago as much as this
looks<00:00:33.120> cool<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:34.290> actually<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:35.010> know

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
looks cool and it actually you know

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.750 
looks cool and it actually you know
looks<00:00:35.399> somewhat<00:00:36.000> presentable<00:00:37.219> again<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
looks somewhat presentable again the

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.510 
looks somewhat presentable again the
font<00:00:39.030> doesn't<00:00:39.360> look<00:00:39.480> right<00:00:39.980> the<00:00:40.980> background

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
font doesn't look right the background

font doesn't look right the background
and<00:00:41.610> whatnot<00:00:41.910> just<00:00:41.940> doesn't<00:00:42.390> feel<00:00:42.540> great<00:00:42.840> and

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
best chance probably sunday night out of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.350 
best chance probably sunday night out of
all<00:01:33.600> three<00:01:33.930> of<00:01:34.020> those<00:01:34.490> last<00:01:35.490> time<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.090> leaked

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
all three of those last time it leaked

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.170 
all three of those last time it leaked
on<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> 10th<00:01:36.900> in<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.259> morning<00:01:37.880> so<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.030> would

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
on the 10th in the morning so that would

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.789 
on the 10th in the morning so that would
make<00:01:39.329> sense<00:01:39.390> if<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.170> was<00:01:40.290> like<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.680> know

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
make sense if it was like you know

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.530 
make sense if it was like you know
Sunday<00:01:41.130> night<00:01:41.280> /<00:01:41.579> monday<00:01:41.820> morning<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.390> be

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
Sunday night / monday morning that be

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.170 
Sunday night / monday morning that be
the<00:01:43.470> night<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.890> 9th<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.850> morning<00:01:45.090> of

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
the night of the 9th and the morning of

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.319 
the night of the 9th and the morning of
the<00:01:45.270> 10th<00:01:45.509> so<00:01:45.960> we<00:01:46.200> should<00:01:46.439> most<00:01:47.250> likely<00:01:47.729> expect

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
the 10th so we should most likely expect

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.520 
the 10th so we should most likely expect
it<00:01:48.570> then<00:01:48.979> what<00:01:49.979> could<00:01:50.220> we<00:01:50.399> see<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.060> know<00:01:51.810> YT<00:01:52.049> yeah

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
I have no idea if we're gonna see any

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.510 
I have no idea if we're gonna see any
more<00:01:54.990> mega<00:01:55.229> evolutions<00:01:55.799> or<00:01:55.920> not<00:01:56.040> in<00:01:56.130> pokemon

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
more mega evolutions or not in pokemon

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.370 
more mega evolutions or not in pokemon
omega<00:01:56.610> ruby<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.119> alpha<00:01:57.149> sapphire<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.840> really

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
omega ruby and alpha sapphire be really

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.370 
omega ruby and alpha sapphire be really
weird<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:59.070> we<00:01:59.759> didn't<00:02:00.240> like<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.750> know<00:02:00.869> there's<00:02:01.320> a

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
weird if we didn't like I know there's a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.940 
weird if we didn't like I know there's a
lot<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.619> evidence<00:02:01.890> seeing<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:03.719> know<00:02:03.869> a<00:02:04.290> lot<00:02:04.920> of

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
lot of evidence seeing you know a lot of

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.649 
lot of evidence seeing you know a lot of
evidence<00:02:05.189> showing<00:02:05.579> how<00:02:05.909> we<00:02:05.969> might<00:02:06.390> not<00:02:06.600> see

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
evidence showing how we might not see

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.710 
evidence showing how we might not see
more<00:02:07.110> mega

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
more mega

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.270 
more mega
shins<00:02:07.900> and<00:02:08.020> Omega<00:02:08.350> room<00:02:08.500> enough<00:02:08.740> sapphire

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
shins and Omega room enough sapphire

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.420 
shins and Omega room enough sapphire
again<00:02:10.180> I<00:02:10.360> hope<00:02:10.600> that<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:10.960> completely<00:02:11.620> false

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
again I hope that is completely false

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.030 
again I hope that is completely false
but<00:02:13.210> there's<00:02:14.170> good<00:02:14.350> evidence<00:02:14.730> anyways<00:02:15.730> um<00:02:16.510> I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
but there's good evidence anyways um I

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.470 
but there's good evidence anyways um I
don't<00:02:18.040> know<00:02:18.220> what<00:02:18.460> we<00:02:18.610> would<00:02:18.790> actually<00:02:18.940> end<00:02:19.210> up

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
don't know what we would actually end up

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.110 
don't know what we would actually end up
seeing<00:02:19.810> in<00:02:20.080> this<00:02:20.440> issue<00:02:21.160> of<00:02:21.430> core<00:02:21.670> pro<00:02:21.910> if

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.730 
seeing in this issue of core pro if
there<00:02:22.300> are<00:02:22.420> actually<00:02:22.780> no<00:02:22.960> my<00:02:22.990> evolutions

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
there are actually no my evolutions

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.830 
there are actually no my evolutions
because<00:02:24.700> with<00:02:24.940> that's<00:02:25.180> kind<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.390> weird<00:02:25.600> you

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:25.840 
because with that's kind of weird you

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.290 
because with that's kind of weird you
know<00:02:25.870> because<00:02:26.320> every<00:02:26.800> time<00:02:27.070> we<00:02:27.610> have<00:02:28.000> gotten

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
know because every time we have gotten

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.220 
know because every time we have gotten
something<00:02:28.510> from<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.840> coracle<00:02:29.760> ever<00:02:30.760> since

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
something from a coracle ever since

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.810 
something from a coracle ever since
except<00:02:32.230> for<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:32.410> time<00:02:32.680> where<00:02:32.980> they<00:02:33.100> announced

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
except for the time where they announced

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.880 
except for the time where they announced
the<00:02:33.910> games<00:02:34.120> every<00:02:34.930> time<00:02:35.080> we<00:02:35.230> got<00:02:35.410> in<00:02:35.500> something

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
the games every time we got in something

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.130 
the games every time we got in something
there's<00:02:36.370> at<00:02:36.610> least<00:02:36.640> been<00:02:36.970> one<00:02:37.240> mega<00:02:37.480> evolution

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
there's at least been one mega evolution

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.680 
there's at least been one mega evolution
so<00:02:39.030> why<00:02:40.030> not<00:02:40.240> know<00:02:40.800> why<00:02:41.800> release<00:02:42.490> all<00:02:42.730> of<00:02:42.790> these

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 
so why not know why release all of these

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:46.830 
so why not know why release all of these
mega<00:02:43.900> evolutions<00:02:44.470> right<00:02:45.420> before<00:02:46.420> the<00:02:46.600> gains

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
mega evolutions right before the gains

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:49.260 
mega evolutions right before the gains
and<00:02:47.290> not<00:02:47.770> show<00:02:48.040> any<00:02:48.340> of<00:02:48.550> them<00:02:48.730> right<00:02:49.060> before

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:49.270 
and not show any of them right before

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.660 
and not show any of them right before
the<00:02:50.260> games<00:02:50.290> come<00:02:50.770> out<00:02:50.920> like<00:02:51.130> a<00:02:51.340> couple<00:02:51.459> of

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
the games come out like a couple of

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.910 
the games come out like a couple of
weeks<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.120> you<00:02:52.900> know<00:02:52.930> ones<00:02:53.560> that<00:02:53.740> we<00:02:53.800> can

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
weeks and you know ones that we can

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:55.560 
weeks and you know ones that we can
actually<00:02:54.040> find<00:02:54.459> hidden<00:02:54.820> in<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.150> games<00:02:55.360> like

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
actually find hidden in the games like

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:57.780 
actually find hidden in the games like
with<00:02:55.750> Pokemon<00:02:56.140> x/y<00:02:56.410> there<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.010> about<00:02:57.190> six<00:02:57.550> mega

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
with Pokemon x/y there is about six mega

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.760 
with Pokemon x/y there is about six mega
evolutions<00:02:58.390> now<00:02:59.020> we<00:02:59.080> did<00:02:59.350> not<00:02:59.500> know<00:02:59.650> about

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
evolutions now we did not know about

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.560 
evolutions now we did not know about
until<00:03:00.040> you<00:03:00.250> actually<00:03:00.370> play<00:03:00.730> the<00:03:00.880> games<00:03:01.090> so

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
until you actually play the games so

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.350 
until you actually play the games so
we'll<00:03:02.380> just<00:03:02.470> have<00:03:02.770> to<00:03:02.890> see<00:03:02.920> and<00:03:03.459> I<00:03:03.640> hope<00:03:03.940> like<00:03:04.209> I

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
we'll just have to see and I hope like I

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.290 
we'll just have to see and I hope like I
said<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.900> hope<00:03:05.170> all<00:03:05.410> the<00:03:06.100> evidence<00:03:06.370> is<00:03:06.670> just<00:03:07.090> I

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
said I hope all the evidence is just I

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.750 
said I hope all the evidence is just I
mean<00:03:07.570> it's<00:03:08.020> there<00:03:08.320> it's<00:03:08.500> evidence<00:03:09.250> but<00:03:09.459> I<00:03:09.490> hope

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
mean it's there it's evidence but I hope

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.420 
mean it's there it's evidence but I hope
you<00:03:09.940> know<00:03:10.380> of<00:03:11.380> course<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.890> know<00:03:12.010> junichi

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
you know of course you know junichi

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.280 
you know of course you know junichi

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
Masuda said in his interview that they

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.930 
Masuda said in his interview that they
were<00:03:14.350> still<00:03:14.620> putting<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:15.070> lot<00:03:15.519> more<00:03:15.700> mega

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
were still putting a lot more mega

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.300 
were still putting a lot more mega
evolutions<00:03:16.420> in<00:03:16.570> this<00:03:16.840> game<00:03:17.050> and<00:03:17.320> he<00:03:17.980> said<00:03:18.190> that

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
evolutions in this game and he said that

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.070 
evolutions in this game and he said that
right<00:03:18.519> before<00:03:18.550> the<00:03:18.910> demo<00:03:19.330> came<00:03:19.570> out<00:03:19.750> right

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
right before the demo came out right

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.810 
right before the demo came out right
before<00:03:20.290> we<00:03:20.590> learned<00:03:20.800> of<00:03:20.950> mega<00:03:21.190> steelix<00:03:21.640> and

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:21.820 
before we learned of mega steelix and

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.509 
before we learned of mega steelix and
make<00:03:21.910> it<00:03:22.030> clearly<00:03:22.300> so<00:03:22.630> we<00:03:22.750> should<00:03:23.519> should

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
make it clearly so we should should

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.610 
make it clearly so we should should
expect<00:03:24.910> more<00:03:25.090> and<00:03:25.420> we<00:03:25.690> also<00:03:25.840> should<00:03:26.260> it<00:03:26.380> I

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620 
expect more and we also should it I

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:29.550 
expect more and we also should it I
don't<00:03:27.130> know<00:03:27.250> I<00:03:27.610> really<00:03:28.600> hope<00:03:28.900> we<00:03:28.930> do<00:03:29.170> get<00:03:29.350> more

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
don't know I really hope we do get more

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.720 
don't know I really hope we do get more
mega<00:03:29.739> evolutions<00:03:30.130> I<00:03:30.250> would<00:03:30.370> love<00:03:30.459> to<00:03:30.519> see<00:03:30.700> a

mega evolutions I would love to see a

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.290 
mega evolutions I would love to see a
mega<00:03:30.940> flygon<00:03:31.390> mega<00:03:31.660> milotic<00:03:33.000> we'll<00:03:34.000> just<00:03:34.209> have

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.300 
mega flygon mega milotic we'll just have

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.570 
mega flygon mega milotic we'll just have
to<00:03:34.390> wait<00:03:34.480> and<00:03:34.540> find<00:03:34.690> out<00:03:35.190> Sunday<00:03:36.190> Monday
