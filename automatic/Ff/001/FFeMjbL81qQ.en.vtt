00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:14.630
 So day 2 of the renovation phase begins we are 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.630
 just about to tint the discs 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.020
 maybe problematic because of it 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.310
 damn it very high and trek 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.320
 has the construction height 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.039
 that is new for the guys everything works out 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.960
 good so far can like this 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.740
 We seem in the dark because yes 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.740
 cool from innermost 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.950
 so i promised that we would be in 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.390
 direct suction out of the 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.000
 Trecker and the breakfast must be clean 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.609
 I have to stop telling you about it 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.899
 have set the four inches high here and 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:24.179
 straight out of the trecker normal 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.679
 he sucks over here over there because giants 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.380
 Air filter system then we need 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.179
 we do not need sound for that 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.569
 we'll take care of the thing here 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:36.869
 and that looks pretty fancy , too 

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:43.259
 believe me there are areas there dreaming 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:55.739
 Every trekker front fits wobbles 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:57.299
 and has air on we go we need 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:01:59.280
 a little bit bigger tool and he 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.299
 must also 600 newton meters per 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.009
 tighten the screw 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.390
 We did something like show us 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.219
 that makes me pretty funny and 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.110
 exciting 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:08.670
 we have almost the whole axis 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.799
 doubled with such a pot of 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.019
 we drove the front laser driven 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:20.489
 ball bearing that they are very very 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:22.950
 turn it slightly and then at the reader 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.150
 send dishes here they come too 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.859
 no longer on it must show so synonymous 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.639
 what you have a real 400 ps 

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:33.380
 Only then will the road traffic know 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:33.380
 What's up is what's on Bach 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.320
 similar to the following through the ball bearing 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.210
 the axis turns with colorful 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.510
 weights attached to it so that this 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:54.240
 slice always horizontal I stay 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:55.310
 think that's pretty cool, I'm yes 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.670
 usually used 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:59.160
 fender widenings to it 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.740
 screw in the case here in the skids 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.790
 widening unscrewed 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.580
 why do we say the same thing 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.200
 see more of the monza moderate tires 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.330
 but no dome at all 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.100
 drive spread but only us 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.930
 they found here they are 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.450
 a bit narrower and show that 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.450
 potential of the beast is 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.100
 that's clear and clear 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:37.960
 I see a lot of running here now 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.420
 so if that would go in the car would 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.190
 But it's not just a dream 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:45.280
 Trecker see that done too 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.720
 so what's more monster her 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.720
 said fed it must be
