00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 good morning beautiful people I am well that 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.970
 avoided welcome to my new blog 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.330
 and video today I want to tell you about 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.190
 cartoon mouse in fact in Greece le 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.590
 adventures of mouse and company not 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:16.020
 will be put on sale by nerds a 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.340
 who has the Hellenic publishing house has 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.859
 in fact announced the stop by 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.240
 Mickey Mouse publishing also have 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.580
 added for us was definitely one 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.500
 easy decision and have tried to hold 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.029
 the testata mila until the last that it 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.740
 flat tvs ports of the deep crisis 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.580
 economy that is going through the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.500
 Greece 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.230
 they even sell in supermarkets 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.140
 expired foods and then to make them 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.280
 expenses are also the comic-book world 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.350
 in fact it was not his headline 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.180
 little mouse to quito directs but others 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.610
 comic books obviously are 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.010
 consequently closing the crisis when 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.360
 there is no money even to eat 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.350
 obviously the comics pass in second 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.640
 plan 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.739
 however in this period they are 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.940
 carrying on negotiations to do 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.710
 so that mouse comes back to be 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.090
 published in Greece 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.920
 I hope with all my heart that these 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.750
 negotiations aimed at a good end because 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.120
 topolino was a childhood companion for 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.860
 millions of children and not just children 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.869
 because you are not just for children 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.970
 they read that adults maybe when 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.040
 I'm in the bathroom doing things and so here 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.390
 I hope with all my heart that I invite you to 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.610
 pass start over at 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.080
 Mickey Mouse publications this crisis 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.420
 economic is touching quite a bit 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.130
 Europe in other countries obviously the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.080
 world of comics is hearing its own 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.360
 crisis also in Italy some houses 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.549
 Million publishers are closing like that 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.170
 for example I read a little while ago that the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.210
 publishing house published the adventures of 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.560
 snoopy and charlie brown had to 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.090
 close for the economic crisis 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.460
 and then other publishers have made us 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.229
 independent surely this is not a 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.240
 happy period for Italian families 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.920
 from an economic point of view and therefore 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.810
 with the difficulty of hribar end of the month 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.479
 even 10 euros a month that you spend 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.210
 for topolino because it costs to 53 comes out 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.649
 once a week they can always 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.750
 many that those that is not to mention 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.729
 with the other comics made examples manga 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.729
 manga for example are very expensive 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.170
 some constant editions 590 and they are not 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.180
 not even the most expensive 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.250
 so with those three comics 5 euros and 90 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.020
 buying for comics turns off already at 18 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.090
 euro and is not a figure from nothing 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.680
 especially first cats 19 years old 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.580
 maybe he is studying then that of 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.229
 money to parents 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.239
 I believe and transforming the child e 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.459
 personal that sales in manga 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.410
 going forward they will always decrease by 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.360
 more and this for the high price that 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:20.370
 have these volumes really are 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.400
 blessings that cost 7 euros and 50 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.840
 volume and even some 12 euros e 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.790
 understand for a boy that we study it 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.319
 even the person who works do not have 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.760
 spent indifferently buying remains 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.860
 because in any case they have a cost 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.209
 I for the moment stopped buying missing 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.400
 little since I was really leaving 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.989
 too much money in the facts since many 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.330
 guys are stopping to buy i 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.830
 manga and I read the wohlen scanner say 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.390
 who read the wrong stairs because 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.430
 actually he is painting a work 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.989
 without buying it but unfortunately not all of them 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.450
 have the opportunity to spend at 6 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.530
 euros for a single and then nothing then 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.190
 especially what I wanted to tell you in 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.019
