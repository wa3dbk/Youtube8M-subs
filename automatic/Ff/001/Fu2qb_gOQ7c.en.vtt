00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 How likely is it that humanity will destroy itself? 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:09.300
 I say, looking at the next 100 years, that there are two trends in today's world. 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.500
 The first trend is towards what we call a 'Type I civilization': 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.100
 a planetary civilization. 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.200
 A civilization that looks like something from Buck Rogers or Flash Gordon. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 A 'Type II civilization' is stellar. 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.900
 They consume so much energy that they can play with stars. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.200
 That is, for example, the Federation of Planets in Star Trek. 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.600
 "Star Trek" would represent a typical Type II civilization. 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.700
 Then we have 'Type III', which is galactic. 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:42.500
 Such as the Borg, or Independence Day, or The Empire of The Empire Strikes Back. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.700
 That is a Type III civilization who is truly galactic. 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.600
 Now, by the time you reach Type II, you are immortal. 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.700
 Nothing known in science can destroy a Type II civilization. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 Comets, meteors, earthquakes, even a supernova! 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.700
 A Type II civilization would be able to survive even a supernova. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.600
 The danger is: the transition between 'Type 0' and 'Type I'. 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.300
 And there we are today: we are a 'Type 0 civilization'. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.300
 We get our energy from dead plants: oil and coal. 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.200
 But if you take a calculator, you can calculate when we will reach Type I status. 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.000
 The answer is: we will become planetary in about 100 years. 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.700
 We will be able to use all energy generation from planet Earth. 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.200
 We will play with the weather! 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.000
 Earthquakes, volcanoes; we will play with all the planetary. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.100
 The danger period is now. 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.200
 Because we still have the savage, we still have all the passions. 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.500
 We have all sectarian, fundamentalist ideas circulating, but we also have nuclear weapons. 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.700
 We have chemical, biological weapons that can wipe out all life on Earth. 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.900
 So I see two trends in the current world. 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.900
 The first trend is towards a multicultural, scientific, tolerant society. 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.500
 And everywhere I go I see aspects of that birth. 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.600
 For example: what is the internet? 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.700
 Many people have written about the internet. Billions and billions of words written over the internet. 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.800
 But for me as a physicist, the internet is the start of a Type I telephone system. 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.600
 A * planetary * telephone system. 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.700
 So we are privileged to witness the birth of Type I technology during our lifetime: a planetary telephone system. 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
 What is english? 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.000
 English is the start of a Type I language. 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.200
 Everywhere I go on Earth, people speak English because 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.500
 that is the lingua franca of science, technology, business ... They all speak English! 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.400
 It is the No. 1 second language on planet Earth. 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.700
 And what is the European Union? 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.300
 The European Union is the start of a Type I economy. 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.300
 And how is it that the European countries - who have always slaughtered each other since the ice began to melt 100,000 years ago - 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.100
 how is it that they joined forces, put aside their differences to found the European Union? 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.500
 Well, to compete with us! 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.600
 And who are 'we'? We are: NAFTA. 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.800
 So we are also starting to see the start of a Type I economy. 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.400
 Then we begin to see the beginning of a Type I culture. 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.500
 Everywhere I go, you can turn on the radio, what do you hear? Rock and roll. You hear rap music, you hear youth music. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.900
 Youth music is now planetary, knows no boundaries about planet Earth. 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.400
 Everywhere I go I see high fashion. Chanel, Gucci bags ... 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.600
 We are witnessing the birth of planetary fashion. 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.800
 Sports too! Look at the Olympic Games. Watch football. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:57.700
 We see the beginning of a tribal initiation ritual, called "sport," that becomes a planetary initiation ritual, 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.100
 that unites the entire planet. 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.400
 So, every time I open the newspaper, every headline I see points 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.600
 to the pangs of a Type I civilization in the making. 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:16.900
 However, every time I open the newspaper, I also see the opposite trend. 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.700
 What is terrorism? 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.800
 Terrorism is, in a way, a reaction against the creation of a Type I civilization. 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.600
 Well, most terrorists cannot express this, 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.600
 they don't have a clue what I'm talking about, 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.900
 but to which they respond is not "modernism"; what they respond to is the fact that 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000
 we are moving towards a multicultural, tolerant, scientific society. And they don't want that. 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.800
 They don't want science, they want a theocracy. 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.900
 They do not want multiculturalism, they want "monoculturalism." 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.500
 So instinctively they despise the march towards a Type I civilization. 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.800
 But which trend will win? 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.800
 I do not know. 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.900
 But I hope we come out as a Type I civilization. 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.100
 And in space, we look for signs of intelligent life in space. 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.600
 So far we find nothing. 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.600
 Civilizations such as Type I should be common in the galaxy. 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.400
 Some people therefore assume that Type 0 civilizations occur fairly often. 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.700
 But only a few of them achieve Type I. 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.600
 Because for the first time in its history such a society has the ability to commit planetary suicide. 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.100
 So perhaps that is why we don't see aliens in space. 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.800
 Maybe they never made it. 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.700
 We may have starships and visit them once, 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.400
 and see atmospheres that are full of radiation because they have had a nuclear war. 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.900
 Atmospheres that are too hot to sustain life because they had a derailed greenhouse effect. 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.500
 Maybe we go into space and see the corpses of Type I civilizations that never really made it. 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.500
 Who knows.
