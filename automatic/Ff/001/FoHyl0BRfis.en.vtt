00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
stuff there's not a whole lot of classes

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.499 
stuff there's not a whole lot of classes
in<00:01:28.500> from<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.710> shell<00:01:28.890> ZeniMax<00:01:29.700> has<00:01:29.820> not<00:01:30.000> released

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
in from a shell ZeniMax has not released

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.240 
in from a shell ZeniMax has not released
a<00:01:30.750> lot<00:01:30.960> information<00:01:31.140> except<00:01:31.799> for<00:01:31.950> their<00:01:32.040> only

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
a lot information except for their only

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.069 
a lot information except for their only
two<00:01:32.460> classes<00:01:32.640> that<00:01:32.970> we<00:01:33.060> know<00:01:33.270> for<00:01:33.600> sure<00:01:33.659> as

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
two classes that we know for sure as

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.719 
two classes that we know for sure as
dragon<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.070> in<00:01:35.159> Templar<00:01:35.810> and<00:01:36.810> even<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:37.979> could

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
dragon on in Templar and even that could

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.480 
dragon on in Templar and even that could
be<00:01:38.970> changed<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.540> little<00:01:39.780> bit<00:01:40.140> but<00:01:42.110> otherwise

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
be changed a little bit but otherwise

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.460 
be changed a little bit but otherwise
those<00:01:44.490> are<00:01:44.640> the<00:01:44.729> classes<00:01:45.119> that<00:01:45.630> we<00:01:46.140> know<00:01:46.259> so

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
those are the classes that we know so

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.950 
those are the classes that we know so
far<00:01:46.500> but<00:01:47.460> I'm<00:01:47.640> assuming<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.420> it's<00:01:48.720> gonna<00:01:48.869> be

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
far but I'm assuming that it's gonna be

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.389 
far but I'm assuming that it's gonna be
since<00:01:49.290> it's<00:01:49.409> going<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.649> be<00:01:49.710> an<00:01:49.770> MMO<00:01:50.100> it's<00:01:50.280> going

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
since it's going to be an MMO it's going

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.350 
since it's going to be an MMO it's going
to<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> lot<00:01:50.820> of<00:01:50.850> classes<00:01:51.180> that<00:01:51.210> are

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to be have a lot of classes that are

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.889 
to be have a lot of classes that are
very<00:01:51.450> soon<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.960> what<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.409> see<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:52.770> Wow<00:01:53.070> and

very soon to what you see on Wow and

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:55.789 
very soon to what you see on Wow and

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
elder scrolls and though all those

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.440

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.390 
Dragon Knight seems really cool I think
the<00:02:09.840> dragon<00:02:10.110> eyes<00:02:10.229> is<00:02:10.649> very<00:02:10.979> similar<00:02:11.190> to<00:02:11.280> the

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
the dragon eyes is very similar to the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.150 
the dragon eyes is very similar to the
Paladin<00:02:11.879> so<00:02:12.120> it<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.390> kind<00:02:12.690> of

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
Paladin so it is kind of

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.070 
Paladin so it is kind of
kind<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.760> tank<00:02:15.460> but<00:02:16.460> so<00:02:17.360> I'm<00:02:17.480> kind<00:02:18.020> of

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
kind of a tank but so I'm kind of

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.330 
kind of a tank but so I'm kind of
getting<00:02:18.260> into<00:02:18.530> more<00:02:18.680> into<00:02:18.860> the<00:02:18.950> ticking<00:02:19.220> so<00:02:19.310> I

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
getting into more into the ticking so I

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.060 
getting into more into the ticking so I
might<00:02:19.550> try<00:02:19.760> to<00:02:19.850> taking<00:02:20.540> in<00:02:20.630> this<00:02:20.780> game<00:02:20.990> on<00:02:21.920> the

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
might try to taking in this game on the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.630 
might try to taking in this game on the
other<00:02:22.220> side<00:02:22.610> note<00:02:23.140> this<00:02:24.140> class<00:02:25.130> is<00:02:25.280> not<00:02:25.400> even
