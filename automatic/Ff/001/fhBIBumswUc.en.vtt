00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.760
 house 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.580
 Welcome to the revenue with 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.700
 dear , the notes were beautiful that you 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.790
 be back for the third episode 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.560
 from my limit to the relaunch and a 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.950
 small historic day after two 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.690
 years, so to speak, about two years ago 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.369
 now comes the relaunch of the long 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.470
 we had announced since autumn 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.940
 no more videos posted online 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.379
 good reason we just wanted to go 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.720
 we wanted a little bit of time for us 

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:42.960
 synonymous a bit the whole format 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.710
 and the simply show sometimes 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.300
 rethink 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.380
 and then we have our learnings 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.559
 I also noticed somehow 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.890
 so that one loop as a drinbleibt 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.980
 and take a look around later on the journey 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.809
 now looks like at the end it was 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.149
 First of all, let's start with that 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.129
 the show to the show as such that is 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.530
 It will be very important to me that she stays 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.509
 very large component of wine on 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.880
 limit it is a big part of this 

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:11.369
 It will continue to be exciting here 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.440
 Guests receive people of whom I have one 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.840
 have high opinion or people whose 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.850
 opinion not interested that gives me 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.290
 also a completely different spectrum 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.290
 completely different possibilities 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:27.390
 the guardrails will be tighter 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.759
 harder at the same time informative and me 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.470
 would also say more direct and pure and 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.330
 that's my wish because that's the way it is 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.890
 I see myself or I just see 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:37.439
 also this format 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.400
 there are many good legs but what we do 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.770
 Do it here where we want 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.049
 interesting the exciting illuminate 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.860
 and then accordingly 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.259
 cry again 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.460
 You can discuss it well 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.500
 it is not worth arguing 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.420
 So the show as such is completely mine 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.750
 important, of course, advertise my course 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.299
 cry that we here in our shop the 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.920
 we have, so to speak, now with us 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.270
 Of course we also cry from it 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.820
 but it is not necessarily 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.320
 necessarily continue it will be just as 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:08.220
 that for a good mix have 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.140
 and i think i can profit myself as well 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.510
 I have also shown that in 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.640
 the many streams we had are 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:15.959
 yes already on the friday 16 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.170
 We now that I am well 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.450
 am willing to discuss that my opinion 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.310
 not a dictator, but 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.890
 I also clearly your opinions 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.870
 listen and of course we still on 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.250
 end or what is very important of course 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.830
 Stay at the bottom of my opinion 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.540
 but that's just the show and this one 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.069
 show the passion is from 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.379
 driven by passion and she is mine 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.480
 very important that they are in this form 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.239
 Who wants to accuse me what 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.909
 he should do that but I have the following 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.739
 Stepped up because you always like that 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.280
 again the roomers herd and therefore 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.209
 I said on the other side 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.110
 I have to live my life with more 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.150
 give transparency 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.239
 Transparency I have before some 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:58.829
 years ago started to import wines 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:01.069
 meanwhile for the gastronomy 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:03.120
 But I learned that more and more customers 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.200
 Consumers simply know our wines 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.340
 want to learn and you want them too 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.989
 Do not buy somewhere you want them 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.640
 just buy here I guess 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:10.530
 a bit out of gratitude a bit 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.870
 sympathy and that is how we understand each other 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.540
 also as a specialist dealer in the internet as 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.859
 fold behind which is also ready with 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.510
 to go by the time that is you 

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:21.180
 can always facebook us via twitter 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.980
 on the side of murder and we are 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.959
 ready to talk we are ready to talk 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.519
 that's important to us too, that's why he has 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.989
 also no prices for example prices 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.329
 First of all, I do not think so 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.370
 decisively clear in the end it must fit 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.870
 but it is important first contact the 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.060
 So please write the wine 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.040
 on the notepad and dagmar and janka 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.269
 I too will answer you 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.799
 and maybe we'll give you some tips 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.359
 give will be different 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:43.919
 maybe not there as well 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:44.579
 partly also very limited 

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.169
 stories 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:47.819
 accordingly it is important that we 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:49.650
 here in personal contact but have 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:50.700
 just to the modern conditions 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.349
 we see ourselves so far as a small 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.819
 I am a trader looking like an aunt 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:55.079
 Emma continues to invite a little one 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:57.329
 believe the corner but just one 

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.650
 plays a little different and we need 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:01.109
 not like the big ones we need 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.849
 no 60 on our wines that are 

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:04.980
 We also calculate cleanly 

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:07.139
 no glasses we give away this too 

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.819
 not and no not no apron no 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.160
 bock on it you get a good glass 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.060
 wine in our opinion at least like that 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.799
 think about it 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.000
 and if you do not like it then you are 

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:16.440
 we ready for it with you 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.780
 discuss and also with it too 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.820
 to talk to you so that's the shop 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:22.560
 transparency is important to me close 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:24.510
 guardrails on one side for the 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.470
 show and now in this combination 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.510
 on 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:30.510
 I think that's a bit where 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.900
 The alpha-phase should be from wine on 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.789
 limit 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.110
 the beta phase was two years ago 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:36.390
 it started we are now 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.830
 actually arrived where I mean 

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:39.419
 that this little format is a good one 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.660
 Chance may have in the German market 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.120
 to insist in the resin 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.560
 German wine market here but it works 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.020
 above all things to the person 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.970
 it makes the industry so special 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:50.410
 interesting personalities that were 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.450
 we illuminate we want great wines 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:54.160
 and above all, we are too 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:55.750
 interested in what you have to say 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.330
 So it's not a one- way street here 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.240
 dialogue in times of web 2.0 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.920
 this is important dialog with you 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.960
 our people already know this format 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:07.060
 have brought to where it says what 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.860
 nobody would have suspected even if he had one 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.060
 is another want to be happy hush 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.560
 us still and I am happy now 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.420
 I am really curious half to the ground 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.280
 what happens look a bit 

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:17.410
 the page still gives us feedback 

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:18.460
 we look what we can change or 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:20.950
 what we can do 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.870
 but important is first look at you 

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.460
 let it work on you today 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.590
 as I said no wine to taste 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.630
 that's why the flu got me out of it 

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:31.000
 like the Santa Claus but I am like that 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.430
 curious and ganga and dagmar us 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.360
 finally wanted to go online today 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.300
 That's why I have a small one 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:39.310
 as you said no 60 for you 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.710
 There is a bit of a percent gift 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:44.320
 what the first orderers of today 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:45.520
 shopping five songs in our shop 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.610
 get this sixth bottle and 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.860
 at least 5 one so any I'd say so 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.470
 every sixth bottle is that wine 

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.650

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:59.260
 also been spoken is a yuck 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:01.690
 a leg from southwestern France unique 

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.850
 he finds the time fits and also great 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:06.640
 tastes good and certainly too 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:08.230
 affordable and as I said who 

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.580
 he ordered more 

00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:12.220
 we said long ago said 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:16.930
 The first 50 I am Eisenhardt is 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:18.880
 but the first 5,000 if not 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.850
 does not matter we are happy too 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.860
 thank the first five thank you dear 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.210
 thank you dear was behind and

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:30.520
 comments I've seen are over 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:31.930
 7,000 are several million individuals 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.340
 Clicks have been here 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:35.440
 we are writing a new chapter now 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.090
 I hope we write the chapter with 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.590
 you maybe one or the other 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.760
 i say goodbye maybe 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:41.890
 one or the other but now 

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.290

00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.810
 that's why the new year is coming 

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.660
 if you have the flu, get well soon 

00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:50.080
 and otherwise continue to have fun in the 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.680
 Glass 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.680
 that 's the point
