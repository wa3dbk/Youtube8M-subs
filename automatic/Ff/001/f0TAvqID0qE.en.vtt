home so it's good to to get away and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.980 
home so it's good to to get away and
allow<00:01:11.490> yourself<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.909> train<00:01:12.210> properly<00:01:12.570> all

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.360 
allow yourself to train properly all
three<00:01:13.229> disciplines<00:01:13.710> whereas<00:01:14.010> at<00:01:14.100> home<00:01:14.250> you

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
three disciplines whereas at home you

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.460 
three disciplines whereas at home you
might<00:01:14.520> give<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:14.820> more<00:01:15.000> restricted<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.840> lot<00:01:16.290> less

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
might give it more restricted a lot less

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.870 
might give it more restricted a lot less
riding<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.100> lot<00:01:17.220> more<00:01:17.400> running<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.790> the

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
riding a lot more running on the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.940 
riding a lot more running on the
treadmill<00:01:18.060> so<00:01:18.570> it's<00:01:19.200> a<00:01:19.260> big<00:01:19.440> difference<00:01:19.620> to

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
treadmill so it's a big difference to

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.469 
treadmill so it's a big difference to
come<00:01:20.100> out<00:01:20.190> here<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.460> have<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.790> freedom<00:01:20.940> to<00:01:21.210> do

a<00:03:24.400> drill<00:03:24.790> focus<00:03:25.210> session<00:03:25.600> and<00:03:25.930> it's<00:03:26.050> great<00:03:26.320> so

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
a drill focus session and it's great so

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.350 
a drill focus session and it's great so
you're<00:03:27.220> not<00:03:27.340> worrying<00:03:27.550> about<00:03:27.670> making<00:03:27.910> times

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
you're not worrying about making times

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:29.880 
you're not worrying about making times
or<00:03:28.660> turnarounds<00:03:29.170> are<00:03:29.260> getting<00:03:29.440> volume<00:03:29.620> in

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
or turnarounds are getting volume in

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.110 
or turnarounds are getting volume in
you're<00:03:30.040> just<00:03:30.190> cracking<00:03:30.400> down<00:03:30.610> on<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.850> stroke

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
you're just cracking down on the stroke

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.090 
you're just cracking down on the stroke
in<00:03:31.300> it<00:03:31.420> it<00:03:31.660> is<00:03:31.900> really<00:03:32.200> important<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.710> stay<00:03:33.070> on

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
in it it is really important to stay on

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.560 
in it it is really important to stay on
top<00:03:33.190> of<00:03:33.340> that<00:03:33.520> swimming<00:03:33.790> is<00:03:33.970> such<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.210> a

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
top of that swimming is such a a

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.110 
top of that swimming is such a a
technical<00:03:35.350> sport<00:03:35.620> when<00:03:36.400> you're<00:03:36.580> racing<00:03:36.730> in

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
technical sport when you're racing in

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.660 
technical sport when you're racing in
the<00:03:37.930> elite<00:03:38.290> races<00:03:38.680> in<00:03:38.830> the<00:03:39.010> world<00:03:39.310> champs

the elite races in the world champs

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.930 
the elite races in the world champs
races<00:03:40.150> or<00:03:40.480> World<00:03:40.810> Cups<00:03:41.080> you<00:03:42.010> do<00:03:42.220> hope<00:03:42.670> that

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
races or World Cups you do hope that

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.000 
races or World Cups you do hope that
everyone's<00:03:43.300> going<00:03:43.450> the<00:03:43.600> right<00:03:43.750> way<00:03:43.810> but<00:03:44.230> it

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
everyone's going the right way but it

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.310 
everyone's going the right way but it
can<00:03:45.250> go<00:03:45.430> wrong<00:03:45.640> and<00:03:45.910> our<00:03:46.000> race<00:03:46.330> in<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.750> Gold

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
can go wrong and our race in the Gold

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.580 
can go wrong and our race in the Gold
Coast<00:03:47.590> in<00:03:48.040> 2009<00:03:48.940> we<00:03:49.240> actually<00:03:49.540> all<00:03:50.170> follow<00:03:50.440> the

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
Coast in 2009 we actually all follow the

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.990 
Coast in 2009 we actually all follow the
leader<00:03:50.800> and<00:03:51.070> we're<00:03:51.160> heading<00:03:51.430> in<00:03:51.550> more<00:03:51.670> clearly

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
leader and we're heading in more clearly

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.670 
leader and we're heading in more clearly
the<00:03:52.090> wrong<00:03:52.210> direction<00:03:52.450> because<00:03:52.960> the<00:03:53.200> Sun<00:03:53.440> was

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:53.680 
the wrong direction because the Sun was

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.980 
the wrong direction because the Sun was
a<00:03:53.890> lot<00:03:54.340> lower<00:03:54.520> than<00:03:54.820> it<00:03:54.910> had<00:03:55.180> been<00:03:55.360> earlier

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
a lot lower than it had been earlier

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:57.990 
a lot lower than it had been earlier
when<00:03:56.260> we'd<00:03:56.410> all<00:03:56.560> practice<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.370> course<00:03:57.580> so<00:03:57.880> you

00:03:57.990 --> 00:03:58.000 
when we'd all practice the course so you

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.760 
when we'd all practice the course so you
really<00:03:58.840> do<00:03:58.960> have<00:03:59.140> to<00:03:59.200> take<00:03:59.290> the<00:03:59.530> initiative

00:03:59.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
really do have to take the initiative

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.650 
really do have to take the initiative
and<00:04:00.190> make<00:04:00.640> sure<00:04:00.790> you're<00:04:00.940> checking<00:04:01.150> as<00:04:01.480> well

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.660 
and make sure you're checking as well

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:03.540 
and make sure you're checking as well
just<00:04:01.990> to<00:04:02.140> be<00:04:02.230> sure<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.920> know<00:04:03.160> the<00:04:03.310> course

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
just to be sure and know the course

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.010 
just to be sure and know the course
strumming<00:04:03.940> it<00:04:04.000> in<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.180> warm-up<00:04:04.540> can<00:04:04.750> really

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
strumming it in the warm-up can really

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.870 
strumming it in the warm-up can really
help<00:04:05.170> just<00:04:05.530> so<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.740> can<00:04:06.130> know<00:04:06.190> where<00:04:06.520> to<00:04:06.670> sign

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
help just so you can know where to sign

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.700 
help just so you can know where to sign
up<00:04:06.910> and<00:04:07.270> not<00:04:07.420> just<00:04:07.990> really<00:04:08.260> hang<00:04:08.440> on<00:04:08.560> that

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:08.710 
up and not just really hang on that

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:10.680 
up and not just really hang on that
person<00:04:09.100> you<00:04:09.190> might<00:04:09.340> be<00:04:09.490> in<00:04:09.580> front<00:04:09.820> I<00:04:10.120> could

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
person you might be in front I could

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.270 
person you might be in front I could
realize<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.350> sighting<00:04:11.740> is<00:04:11.860> when<00:04:12.010> you<00:04:12.100> get

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
realize you the sighting is when you get

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.460 
realize you the sighting is when you get
to<00:04:12.430> do<00:04:12.520> open<00:04:12.640> water<00:04:12.970> practice

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:14.470 
to do open water practice

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.160 
to do open water practice
try<00:04:15.070> looking<00:04:15.580> at<00:04:15.880> tracking<00:04:16.570> start<00:04:16.870> you<00:04:17.110> start

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.170 
try looking at tracking start you start

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:18.960 
try looking at tracking start you start
strimmin<00:04:17.590> and<00:04:17.799> either<00:04:18.040> you<00:04:18.370> look<00:04:18.489> up<00:04:18.700> after

00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:18.970 
strimmin and either you look up after

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:20.820 
strimmin and either you look up after
six<00:04:19.180> straight<00:04:19.450> and<00:04:19.870> then<00:04:20.170> you<00:04:20.260> look<00:04:20.410> up<00:04:20.500> after

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:20.830 
six straight and then you look up after

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.290 
six straight and then you look up after
nine<00:04:21.010> and<00:04:21.040> then<00:04:21.400> you<00:04:21.459> look<00:04:21.610> up<00:04:21.670> after<00:04:22.030> twelve

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
nine and then you look up after twelve

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.870 
nine and then you look up after twelve
and<00:04:22.930> then<00:04:23.050> you<00:04:23.140> look<00:04:23.290> up<00:04:23.400> after<00:04:24.400> fifteen<00:04:24.760> and

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
and then you look up after fifteen and

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.370 
and then you look up after fifteen and
you<00:04:24.970> start<00:04:25.210> trusting<00:04:25.480> yourself<00:04:25.750> more<00:04:26.230> and

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
you start trusting yourself more and

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.930 
you start trusting yourself more and
then<00:04:26.500> you<00:04:26.590> try<00:04:26.800> and<00:04:26.830> look<00:04:26.980> if<00:04:27.070> only<00:04:27.340> every<00:04:27.550> 15

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
then you try and look if only every 15

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.790 
then you try and look if only every 15
so<00:04:28.270> they're<00:04:29.020> letting<00:04:29.320> you<00:04:29.380> look<00:04:29.410> at<00:04:29.680> the

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
so they're letting you look at the

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.620 
so they're letting you look at the
better<00:04:29.980> and<00:04:30.280> I<00:04:30.580> think<00:04:30.730> doing<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.300> helps<00:04:31.480> you

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
better and I think doing that helps you

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.080 
better and I think doing that helps you
practice<00:04:31.780> and<00:04:32.110> straight<00:04:32.380> to<00:04:33.000> atmosphere<00:04:34.000> in

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
practice and straight to atmosphere in

practice and straight to atmosphere in
club<00:04:34.300> we<00:04:34.450> do<00:04:34.600> most<00:04:34.930> fast<00:04:35.170> forming<00:04:35.440> from<00:04:35.740> a

club we do most fast forming from a
time-based<00:04:36.250> interval<00:04:37.030> we<00:04:37.690> will<00:04:38.170> record<00:04:38.440> heart

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
time-based interval we will record heart

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.160 
time-based interval we will record heart
rate<00:04:38.920> in<00:04:39.100> specific<00:04:39.610> sessions<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:40.450> the<00:04:40.960> heart

rate in specific sessions and the heart
rate<00:04:41.230> sessions<00:04:41.740> like<00:04:42.040> the<00:04:42.490> 21<00:04:42.940> hundreds<00:04:43.390> and

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
rate sessions like the 21 hundreds and

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:45.420 
rate sessions like the 21 hundreds and
they'll<00:04:44.170> be<00:04:44.290> recorded<00:04:44.740> every<00:04:44.950> time<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.250> do

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
they'll be recorded every time you do

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.730 
they'll be recorded every time you do
them<00:04:45.640> but<00:04:45.910> most<00:04:46.510> of<00:04:46.630> the<00:04:46.720> time<00:04:46.930> it<00:04:47.140> is<00:04:47.290> just<00:04:47.590> off

e<00:04:58.740> 3<00:04:59.740> and<00:04:59.800> E<00:04:59.920> 4<00:04:59.950> so<00:05:00.370> like<00:05:00.640> that's<00:05:00.760> my<00:05:00.970> zone<00:05:01.270> and

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
e 3 and E 4 so like that's my zone and

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.980 
e 3 and E 4 so like that's my zone and
so<00:05:03.100> again<00:05:03.370> that<00:05:03.430> faster<00:05:03.970> Notaro<00:05:04.390> so<00:05:04.510> equals

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:04.990 
so again that faster Notaro so equals

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.750 
so again that faster Notaro so equals
working<00:05:05.380> pretty<00:05:05.530> hard<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:06.130> then<00:05:06.250> when<00:05:06.670> we

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
working pretty hard and then when we

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:08.070 
working pretty hard and then when we
drop<00:05:06.940> down<00:05:06.970> from<00:05:07.330> that<00:05:07.540> and<00:05:07.690> I<00:05:07.750> think<00:05:07.810> that's

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 
drop down from that and I think that's

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.440 
drop down from that and I think that's
quite<00:05:08.230> a<00:05:08.320> nice<00:05:08.500> way<00:05:08.710> to<00:05:08.740> work<00:05:09.090> and<00:05:10.090> again<00:05:10.360> we

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
quite a nice way to work and again we

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.570 
quite a nice way to work and again we
work<00:05:10.630> on<00:05:10.780> interval<00:05:11.110> based<00:05:11.260> attune<00:05:11.650> so<00:05:11.980> it's

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
work on interval based attune so it's

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.100 
work on interval based attune so it's
good<00:05:12.760> to<00:05:12.850> mix<00:05:12.970> it<00:05:13.150> up<00:05:13.210> like<00:05:13.420> that<00:05:13.570> when<00:05:14.020> I'm

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
good to mix it up like that when I'm

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.720 
good to mix it up like that when I'm
swimming<00:05:14.290> in<00:05:14.380> a<00:05:14.500> wetsuit<00:05:14.710> and<00:05:14.890> definitely<00:05:15.670> a

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
swimming in a wetsuit and definitely a

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.540 
swimming in a wetsuit and definitely a
lot<00:05:15.940> faster<00:05:16.480> in<00:05:16.930> a<00:05:16.990> race<00:05:17.290> tend<00:05:18.010> to<00:05:18.100> be<00:05:18.220> about<00:05:18.490> a

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
lot faster in a race tend to be about a

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.640 
lot faster in a race tend to be about a
minute<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:19.300> a<00:05:19.570> minute<00:05:19.630> and<00:05:19.900> a<00:05:19.990> half<00:05:20.110> faster

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:20.650 
minute to a minute and a half faster

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:23.280 
minute to a minute and a half faster
1,500<00:05:21.580> I<00:05:21.790> haven't<00:05:22.330> I<00:05:22.360> should<00:05:22.510> tie<00:05:22.690> myself<00:05:22.900> in<00:05:23.230> a

1,500 I haven't I should tie myself in a

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.380 
1,500 I haven't I should tie myself in a
pool<00:05:23.500> but<00:05:23.800> on<00:05:24.280> average<00:05:24.490> red<00:05:24.880> tears<00:05:25.150> are<00:05:25.330> about

pool but on average red tears are about

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.170 
pool but on average red tears are about
two<00:05:25.840> seconds<00:05:26.290> faster<00:05:26.470> a<00:05:26.830> hundred<00:05:27.460> in<00:05:27.820> the<00:05:27.970> pool

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
two seconds faster a hundred in the pool

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.970 
two seconds faster a hundred in the pool
four<00:05:28.390> hundred<00:05:28.660> reps<00:05:28.900> how<00:05:29.410> many<00:05:29.590> when<00:05:29.710> I<00:05:29.740> put<00:05:29.950> a

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
four hundred reps how many when I put a

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:32.610 
four hundred reps how many when I put a
wetsuit<00:05:30.370> on<00:05:30.520> in<00:05:31.419> a<00:05:31.570> race<00:05:31.780> again<00:05:32.200> will<00:05:32.380> swim

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:32.620 
wetsuit on in a race again will swim

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.800 
wetsuit on in a race again will swim
minute<00:05:33.100> minute<00:05:33.370> and<00:05:33.460> half<00:05:33.550> quicker<00:05:33.970> and<00:05:34.120> M

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
minute minute and half quicker and M

I've<00:05:35.050> been<00:05:35.200> arrested<00:05:35.410> before<00:05:35.710> and<00:05:36.070> a<00:05:36.100> hundred

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
I've been arrested before and a hundred

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.340 
I've been arrested before and a hundred
session<00:05:36.820> and<00:05:36.970> I've<00:05:37.480> dropped<00:05:37.660> my<00:05:37.780> time<00:05:38.050> down<00:05:38.320> to

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
session and I've dropped my time down to

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:41.190 
session and I've dropped my time down to
63<00:05:38.800> so<00:05:39.310> for<00:05:39.460> me<00:05:39.580> it<00:05:39.730> cannot<00:05:40.030> knock<00:05:40.750> over<00:05:40.930> five

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:41.200 
63 so for me it cannot knock over five

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.870 
63 so for me it cannot knock over five
seconds<00:05:41.620> off<00:05:41.680> their<00:05:41.920> hundred<00:05:42.340> so<00:05:42.550> from<00:05:42.790> here

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
seconds off their hundred so from here

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.230 
seconds off their hundred so from here
it<00:05:42.970> makes<00:05:43.120> a<00:05:43.570> massive<00:05:44.020> difference
