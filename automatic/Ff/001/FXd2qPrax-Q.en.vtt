00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:08.870
 welcome here in the clear 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.090
 I have the bun becker 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.559
 Do you know that you would like to enter 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.559
 or bake two buns 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.619
 No problem baking oven to preheat 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.849
 costs a lot of time but also a lot of energy 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.670
 here with these buns becker 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:25.130
 use only five percent of 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:27.560
 energy versus a normal 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.060
 oven and how does it work ? 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.580
 Actually, I can tell you 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.480
 Of course, this bun becker 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.150
 much smaller 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.760
 but you do not have to blame here 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.360
 we have here in this clip 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.110
 cover 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.780
 here we have a waveform and 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.250
 this wave form creates a 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.309
 recirculation principle 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.150
 you know, heat rises and so does 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:55.400
 then arises here this air circulation principle 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:58.309
 what can they do in here? 

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.280
 Not only do they bake baking 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.059
 bake refreshen ready to bake 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.450
 baked everything possible think about it 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:13.719
 rolls think of a sausage roll 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:16.930
 or croissants or small mini pizzas 

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:21.289
 Of course, everything is possible 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.340
 Of course, this device is baking 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.670
 warm 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:29.420
 so beware but the handles the 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:32.719
 cent heat insulated here from the capped 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:35.149
 but also from the bug right here 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:40.119
 they can grow at the same time 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:43.789
 use to much of the bun 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.819
 cleaning is also very easy for us 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:49.969
 you have a green one here 

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:52.759
 drawer so also the clean of 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.579
 This bun becker is very light 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.469
 even stowing is easy because we 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:01.119
 have below a fact 

00:01:57.469 --> 00:02:04.840
 cable winder as you see here then 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:07.780
 of course, a nice frosted 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.540
 stainless steel housing then we have here 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:14.629
 a timer with minutes 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.010
 hint a light and what 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:18.110
 is also important 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.299
 if the rolls are done then listen 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:26.930
 she and then gorgeous of 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:30.049
 baked fresh baked bread 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.549
 baked in the bun becker 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:33.549
