00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
to my bad company two days where

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.630 
to my bad company two days where
basically<00:01:21.530> everything<00:01:22.530> in<00:01:22.740> that<00:01:22.890> game<00:01:23.159> was

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
basically everything in that game was

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.880 
basically everything in that game was
fully<00:01:23.939> destructible<00:01:24.390> you<00:01:24.840> fired<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.380> rocket<00:01:25.560> at

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
fully destructible you fired a rocket at

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.160 
fully destructible you fired a rocket at
a<00:01:25.920> building<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.610> could<00:01:26.820> take<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.210> down<00:01:27.450> and<00:01:27.810> I

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
a building you could take it down and I

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.870 
a building you could take it down and I
know<00:01:28.290> that<00:01:28.470> was<00:01:28.590> a<00:01:28.619> very<00:01:28.799> large<00:01:29.130> critique<00:01:29.700> of

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
know that was a very large critique of

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.760 
know that was a very large critique of
battlefield<00:01:30.509> 3<00:01:30.720> the<00:01:30.869> previous<00:01:31.259> game<00:01:31.439> where

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
battlefield 3 the previous game where

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.350 
battlefield 3 the previous game where
there<00:01:31.920> wasn't<00:01:32.159> that<00:01:32.310> type<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.640> destruction

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
there wasn't that type of destruction

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.300 
there wasn't that type of destruction
and<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.990> it's<00:01:34.110> nice<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.500> see<00:01:34.680> that<00:01:34.710> it's<00:01:35.100> kind

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
and so it's nice to see that it's kind

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.460 
and so it's nice to see that it's kind
of<00:01:35.490> been<00:01:35.670> added<00:01:36.150> back<00:01:36.299> into<00:01:36.360> battle<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.200> and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
of been added back into battle for and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.830 
of been added back into battle for and
while<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.340> every<00:01:39.030> single<00:01:39.240> map<00:01:39.600> like

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
while it's not on every single map like

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.149 
while it's not on every single map like
you<00:01:39.960> can't<00:01:40.200> bring<00:01:40.380> down<00:01:40.560> every<00:01:40.860> single

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
you can't bring down every single

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.280 
you can't bring down every single
skyscraper<00:01:41.420> it's<00:01:42.420> nice<00:01:42.630> to<00:01:42.780> see<00:01:42.930> that<00:01:42.960> there

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
skyscraper it's nice to see that there

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.410 
skyscraper it's nice to see that there
are<00:01:43.320> buildings<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.159> there<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.880> have<00:01:45.119> that

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
are buildings in there that have that

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.899 
are buildings in there that have that
fully<00:01:45.780> destructible<00:01:46.380> capabilities<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.549> I

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
fully destructible capabilities and I

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.210 
fully destructible capabilities and I
think<00:01:48.149> it's<00:01:48.270> actually<00:01:48.540> even<00:01:49.070> advanced<00:01:50.070> or

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
think it's actually even advanced or

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.770 
think it's actually even advanced or
there's<00:01:50.399> even<00:01:50.700> more<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.420> in<00:01:51.540> the

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
there's even more of it in the

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.630 
there's even more of it in the
battlefield<00:01:52.079> 4<00:01:52.259> compared<00:01:52.829> a<00:01:52.920> bad<00:01:53.070> company<00:01:53.490> 2

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
battlefield 4 compared a bad company 2

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.749 
battlefield 4 compared a bad company 2
where<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> buildings<00:01:54.869> have<00:01:55.320> more<00:01:55.890> walls<00:01:56.310> to

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
where the buildings have more walls to

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.039 
where the buildings have more walls to
destroy<00:01:57.210> their<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.540> little<00:01:57.750> bit<00:01:57.840> larger

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
destroy their a little bit larger

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.050 
destroy their a little bit larger
there's<00:01:58.590> more<00:01:58.860> kind<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.700> just<00:01:59.880> more

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
there's more kind it is just more

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.450 
there's more kind it is just more
surfaces<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.380> can<00:02:01.560> blow<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.399> it

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
surfaces that you can blow up and it

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.219 
surfaces that you can blow up and it
gives<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.759> more<00:02:02.969> options<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:03.689> love<00:02:04.020> that

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
gives you more options and I love that

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.639 
gives you more options and I love that
but<00:02:05.009> as<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.880> major<00:02:06.360> LEvolution<00:02:07.170> moment<00:02:07.530> I

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
but as for a major LEvolution moment I

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.529 
but as for a major LEvolution moment I
think<00:02:07.740> my<00:02:08.280> favorite<00:02:08.640> is<00:02:08.849> going<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.270> to<00:02:09.390> go

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
think my favorite is going to have to go

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.190 
think my favorite is going to have to go
to<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:10.440> IEDs<00:02:11.220> on<00:02:11.580> Golmud<00:02:11.970> railway<00:02:12.000> zaz<00:02:12.540> well

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
to the IEDs on Golmud railway zaz well

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.229 
to the IEDs on Golmud railway zaz well
there<00:02:13.650> isn't<00:02:13.980> many<00:02:14.069> things<00:02:14.459> cooler<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.090> this

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
there isn't many things cooler in this

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:17.720 
there isn't many things cooler in this
game<00:02:15.450> at<00:02:15.629> least<00:02:15.810> in<00:02:15.930> my<00:02:16.050> opinion<00:02:16.200> then<00:02:17.160> seen

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
game at least in my opinion then seen

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.250 
game at least in my opinion then seen
one<00:02:17.970> of<00:02:18.060> those<00:02:18.150> things<00:02:18.360> go<00:02:18.629> off<00:02:18.840> and<00:02:19.140> then

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
one of those things go off and then

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.350 
one of those things go off and then
having<00:02:19.739> someone<00:02:20.220> die<00:02:20.370> to<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.700> like<00:02:20.940> it<00:02:21.269> doesn't

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
having someone die to it like it doesn't

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.880 
having someone die to it like it doesn't
happen<00:02:21.599> very<00:02:21.750> often<00:02:22.140> and<00:02:22.470> I<00:02:22.560> think<00:02:22.739> that's

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
happen very often and I think that's

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.530 
happen very often and I think that's
what<00:02:23.069> makes<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.340> so<00:02:23.519> magical<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.150> so<00:02:24.330> cool

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
what makes it so magical and so cool

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.660 
what makes it so magical and so cool
when<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.810> actually<00:02:24.989> happens<00:02:25.560> but<00:02:26.099> seeing<00:02:26.459> the

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
when it actually happens but seeing the

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.420 
when it actually happens but seeing the
massive<00:02:27.000> explosion<00:02:27.629> seeing<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.560> tank<00:02:28.920> burst

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
massive explosion seeing a tank burst

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.270 
massive explosion seeing a tank burst
into<00:02:29.970> a<00:02:30.000> fiery<00:02:30.450> ball<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:31.140> flames<00:02:31.500> there<00:02:32.130> are

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
into a fiery ball of flames there are

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.650 
into a fiery ball of flames there are
many<00:02:32.550> things<00:02:32.640> cooler<00:02:33.030> than<00:02:33.209> that<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.540> I<00:02:33.630> know

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
many things cooler than that and I know

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.780 
many things cooler than that and I know
what's<00:02:33.959> known<00:02:34.110> as<00:02:34.290> flashy<00:02:34.590> as<00:02:34.800> a<00:02:34.980> massive

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
what's known as flashy as a massive

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.970 
what's known as flashy as a massive
skyscraper<00:02:36.360> falling<00:02:36.690> down<00:02:36.900> or<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.709> damn

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
skyscraper falling down or a damn

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:40.100 
skyscraper falling down or a damn
exploding<00:02:38.700> or<00:02:38.790> anything<00:02:39.060> like<00:02:39.090> that<00:02:39.269> but<00:02:39.930> when

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
exploding or anything like that but when

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.539 
exploding or anything like that but when
you're<00:02:40.200> able<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.560> pull<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.739> off<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.220> you<00:02:41.310> see

00:02:41.539 --> 00:02:41.549 
you're able to pull it off and you see

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:43.430 
you're able to pull it off and you see
the<00:02:41.700> explosion<00:02:42.209> happening<00:02:42.629> it's<00:02:43.080> extremely

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
the explosion happening it's extremely

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.530 
the explosion happening it's extremely
satisfying<00:02:44.129> and<00:02:44.400> so<00:02:44.549> I<00:02:44.580> would<00:02:44.849> say<00:02:45.030> that<00:02:45.060> that

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
satisfying and so I would say that that

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.050 
satisfying and so I would say that that
is<00:02:45.750> my<00:02:46.170> favorite<00:02:46.620> LEvolution<00:02:47.549> as<00:02:47.700> of<00:02:47.910> right

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
is my favorite LEvolution as of right

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.750 
is my favorite LEvolution as of right
now<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:49.049> next<00:02:49.260> question<00:02:49.410> comes<00:02:49.769> from<00:02:50.040> a<00:02:50.370> 12

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
now the next question comes from a 12

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:52.819 
now the next question comes from a 12
Mustang<00:02:51.360> and<00:02:51.540> it<00:02:51.690> is<00:02:51.810> how<00:02:52.260> would<00:02:52.470> you<00:02:52.590> feel

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
Mustang and it is how would you feel

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.100 
Mustang and it is how would you feel
about<00:02:52.890> a<00:02:53.190> system<00:02:53.430> put<00:02:53.819> in<00:02:53.849> place<00:02:53.970> to<00:02:54.660> see<00:02:54.900> how

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
about a system put in place to see how

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.839 
about a system put in place to see how
many<00:02:55.349> classes<00:02:55.860> are<00:02:55.980> being<00:02:56.220> played<00:02:56.430> on<00:02:56.640> your

00:02:56.839 --> 00:02:56.849 
many classes are being played on your

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:58.580 
many classes are being played on your
team<00:02:57.060> I<00:02:57.329> feel<00:02:57.750> this<00:02:57.870> could<00:02:58.019> encourage<00:02:58.319> players

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
team I feel this could encourage players

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.160 
team I feel this could encourage players
to<00:02:58.829> play<00:02:59.099> a<00:02:59.340> class<00:02:59.670> that<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.239> team<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.540> lacking

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
to play a class that the team is lacking

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:03.559 
to play a class that the team is lacking
however<00:03:01.769> it<00:03:02.130> won't<00:03:02.489> be<00:03:02.730> a<00:03:02.760> requirement<00:03:03.299> to

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
however it won't be a requirement to

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.300 
however it won't be a requirement to
play<00:03:03.840> something<00:03:04.140> else<00:03:04.410> outside<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.099> class

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
play something else outside the class

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.800 
play something else outside the class
that<00:03:05.459> you<00:03:05.549> want<00:03:05.700> to<00:03:05.790> play<00:03:05.940> what<00:03:06.630> are<00:03:06.690> your

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
that you want to play what are your

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.170 
that you want to play what are your
thoughts<00:03:07.049> on<00:03:07.319> this<00:03:07.560> I<00:03:07.829> think<00:03:08.730> that<00:03:08.760> this<00:03:08.940> is<00:03:09.150> a

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
thoughts on this I think that this is a

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.870 
thoughts on this I think that this is a
phenomenal<00:03:09.780> idea<00:03:10.349> as<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:11.250> say<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.760> won't

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
phenomenal idea as you say it won't

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.180 
phenomenal idea as you say it won't
force<00:03:12.329> people<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:12.780> play<00:03:13.019> a<00:03:13.049> certain<00:03:13.349> role<00:03:13.500> but

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
force people to play a certain role but

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
know to get into a mash I've heard some

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.340 
know to get into a mash I've heard some
people<00:05:40.330> are<00:05:40.420> even<00:05:40.450> having<00:05:40.870> problems<00:05:41.230> with

I think many other people out there are

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.520 
I think many other people out there are
pretty<00:05:45.970> disappointed<00:05:46.600> with<00:05:46.840> what<00:05:46.870> DICE<00:05:47.500> has

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
pretty disappointed with what DICE has

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.220 
pretty disappointed with what DICE has

done so far the next question comes from
shriven<00:05:50.890> and<00:05:51.070> it<00:05:51.160> is<00:05:51.280> what<00:05:51.730> do<00:05:51.850> you<00:05:51.910> think<00:05:52.210> that

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:52.420 
shriven and it is what do you think that

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:54.420

people's necks for takedowns and rapidly

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:02.880 
people's necks for takedowns and rapidly
throwing<00:06:01.270> punches<00:06:01.510> instead<00:06:02.140> of<00:06:02.290> slowly

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:02.890 
throwing punches instead of slowly

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.370 
throwing punches instead of slowly
swinging<00:06:03.430> your<00:06:03.520> blade<00:06:03.760> well<00:06:04.690> it<00:06:04.930> would<00:06:05.080> it

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
swinging your blade well it would it

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.810 
swinging your blade well it would it
would<00:06:05.440> definitely<00:06:05.680> be<00:06:05.890> it<00:06:06.610> would<00:06:06.670> definitely

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:06.820 
would definitely be it would definitely

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:08.520 
would definitely be it would definitely
be<00:06:07.000> very<00:06:07.210> interesting<00:06:07.780> if<00:06:07.990> they<00:06:08.170> did<00:06:08.380> have

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.530 
be very interesting if they did have

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:09.960 
be very interesting if they did have
this<00:06:08.680> in<00:06:08.830> there<00:06:09.070> and<00:06:09.250> I<00:06:09.280> mean<00:06:09.640> it<00:06:09.760> wouldn't

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
this in there and I mean it wouldn't

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.670 
this in there and I mean it wouldn't
change<00:06:10.210> anything<00:06:10.660> dramatically<00:06:11.380> it<00:06:11.590> would

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
change anything dramatically it would

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.190 
change anything dramatically it would
basically<00:06:11.860> just<00:06:12.310> be<00:06:12.640> a<00:06:12.910> different<00:06:13.630> animation

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:14.200 
basically just be a different animation

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.010 
basically just be a different animation
and<00:06:14.470> while<00:06:15.400> I<00:06:15.430> wouldn't<00:06:16.030> be<00:06:16.210> completely

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
and while I wouldn't be completely

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.590 
and while I wouldn't be completely
opposed<00:06:17.830> to<00:06:18.100> it<00:06:18.280> honestly<00:06:19.090> what<00:06:19.300> I<00:06:19.360> would

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
opposed to it honestly what I would

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.300 
opposed to it honestly what I would
prefer<00:06:19.810> more<00:06:20.170> is<00:06:20.380> just<00:06:20.410> to<00:06:20.650> have<00:06:20.800> maybe<00:06:20.950> some

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
prefer more is just to have maybe some

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.270 
prefer more is just to have maybe some
slight<00:06:21.640> variations<00:06:22.390> to<00:06:22.530> the<00:06:23.530> existing

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:24.280 
slight variations to the existing

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.830 
slight variations to the existing
animations<00:06:24.820> that<00:06:24.880> we<00:06:25.030> have<00:06:25.210> for<00:06:25.510> knifes

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
animations that we have for knifes

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:28.380 
animations that we have for knifes
already<00:06:26.230> like<00:06:26.500> I<00:06:26.680> unlocked<00:06:27.310> the<00:06:27.520> the<00:06:28.030> machete

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:28.390 
already like I unlocked the the machete

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:29.910 
already like I unlocked the the machete
which<00:06:28.630> you<00:06:28.750> get<00:06:28.930> through<00:06:29.200> i<00:06:29.230> think<00:06:29.620> the<00:06:29.890> the

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:29.920 
which you get through i think the the

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:31.980 
which you get through i think the the
campaign<00:06:30.730> the<00:06:30.880> single-player<00:06:31.210> campaign<00:06:31.750> and

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:31.990 
campaign the single-player campaign and

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:34.620 
campaign the single-player campaign and
i<00:06:32.380> was<00:06:32.500> expecting<00:06:32.890> it<00:06:33.100> to<00:06:33.310> be<00:06:33.340> this<00:06:33.790> awesome

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:34.630 
i was expecting it to be this awesome

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.330 
i was expecting it to be this awesome
new<00:06:34.870> weapon<00:06:35.620> that<00:06:35.740> have<00:06:35.950> a<00:06:35.980> different

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:36.340 
new weapon that have a different

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.040 
new weapon that have a different
animation<00:06:36.820> where<00:06:37.000> you<00:06:37.180> maybe<00:06:37.360> go<00:06:37.600> for<00:06:37.630> more<00:06:37.990> of

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
animation where you maybe go for more of

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.820 
animation where you maybe go for more of
a<00:06:38.170> hacker

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:38.830

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:40.840 
flash on the enemy but you use it the

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:42.840 
flash on the enemy but you use it the
same<00:06:41.110> way<00:06:41.320> as<00:06:41.560> you<00:06:41.740> do<00:06:41.890> the<00:06:42.340> shank<00:06:42.640> where<00:06:42.790> you

have<00:06:59.740> a<00:07:00.040> different<00:07:00.400> animation<00:07:00.850> was<00:07:01.000> a<00:07:01.060> little

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:01.300 
have a different animation was a little

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.180 
have a different animation was a little
disappointing<00:07:01.780> for<00:07:01.930> me<00:07:01.960> and<00:07:02.200> so<00:07:02.590> what<00:07:02.980> I<00:07:03.010> would

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:03.190 
disappointing for me and so what I would

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.010 
disappointing for me and so what I would
kind<00:07:03.340> of<00:07:03.460> like<00:07:03.580> to<00:07:03.640> see<00:07:03.910> is<00:07:04.120> to<00:07:04.360> maybe<00:07:04.660> have

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:05.020 
kind of like to see is to maybe have

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:07.470 
kind of like to see is to maybe have
just<00:07:05.890> a<00:07:05.980> couple<00:07:06.010> variations<00:07:06.610> of<00:07:07.060> the

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:07.480 
just a couple variations of the

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:10.110 
just a couple variations of the
animations<00:07:08.080> for<00:07:08.350> the<00:07:08.800> existing<00:07:09.580> knives<00:07:09.790> and

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 
animations for the existing knives and

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.580 
animations for the existing knives and
you<00:07:10.270> know<00:07:10.420> if<00:07:10.600> they<00:07:10.870> don't<00:07:11.050> have<00:07:11.350> the

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
you know if they don't have the

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.560 
you know if they don't have the
resources<00:07:11.740> to<00:07:12.250> do<00:07:12.550> this<00:07:12.790> you<00:07:13.000> know<00:07:13.120> we<00:07:13.330> already

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:13.570 
resources to do this you know we already

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:14.820 
resources to do this you know we already
talked<00:07:13.750> about<00:07:13.870> how<00:07:14.350> they're<00:07:14.590> already

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.830 
talked about how they're already

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.230 
talked about how they're already
struggling<00:07:15.190> with<00:07:15.460> the<00:07:15.550> resources<00:07:16.030> and<00:07:16.150> they

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:16.240 
struggling with the resources and they

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.840 
struggling with the resources and they
have<00:07:16.420> then<00:07:16.960> don't<00:07:17.230> do<00:07:17.530> this<00:07:17.560> but<00:07:18.310> you<00:07:18.430> know<00:07:18.550> for

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:18.850 
have then don't do this but you know for

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.600 
have then don't do this but you know for
a<00:07:19.180> future<00:07:19.540> DLC<00:07:20.320> or<00:07:20.710> way<00:07:21.100> off<00:07:21.280> in<00:07:21.520> the<00:07:21.550> distance

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:21.610 
a future DLC or way off in the distance

00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:24.360 
a future DLC or way off in the distance
if<00:07:22.090> they<00:07:22.240> had<00:07:22.450> in<00:07:22.720> some<00:07:23.080> just<00:07:23.860> some<00:07:23.980> different

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370 
if they had in some just some different

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:25.980 
if they had in some just some different
animations<00:07:24.940> it<00:07:25.180> could<00:07:25.330> make<00:07:25.570> some<00:07:25.840> of<00:07:25.930> the

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:25.990 
animations it could make some of the

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.960 
animations it could make some of the
knives<00:07:26.170> just<00:07:26.470> feel<00:07:26.740> more<00:07:27.040> unique<00:07:27.550> it<00:07:27.760> wouldn't

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:27.970 
knives just feel more unique it wouldn't

00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:29.580 
knives just feel more unique it wouldn't
just<00:07:28.090> be<00:07:28.120> the<00:07:28.270> same<00:07:28.480> animation<00:07:28.900> over<00:07:29.350> and<00:07:29.470> over

00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:29.590 
just be the same animation over and over

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.900 
just be the same animation over and over
and<00:07:29.830> I<00:07:30.220> think<00:07:30.400> that<00:07:30.520> would<00:07:30.580> be<00:07:30.670> a<00:07:30.700> nice

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:30.910 
and I think that would be a nice

00:07:30.910 --> 00:07:33.090 
and I think that would be a nice
addition<00:07:31.170> but<00:07:32.170> yeah<00:07:32.350> guys<00:07:32.530> that<00:07:32.590> is<00:07:32.830> it<00:07:33.070> for

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:33.100
