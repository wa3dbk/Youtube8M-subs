00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.279
 Hello sir I toupee how is it I 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.280
 very well 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:10.470
 welcome another day more to mamani month and 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.970
 Well, I'm going to tell you good, well, 

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.770
 another day I was in private classes and 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.780
 instead of doing in my comment of 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.060
 I philosophy and micro single 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.610
 We decided to talk about the pros and 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.070
 against the drawings from before and the 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.080
 drawings of now and I said I already for 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.119
 a good blog okay let's start 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.340
 because if we do not, we never start and the 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.650
 video just lasts what lasts and finally 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.109
 I'm tired of me and we're going to 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.030
 start with the drawings before the 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:38.370
 years of our childhood at least 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.590
 those of us from '93 I grew up watching 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.620
 May 10 among other drawings and the truth 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.020
 is that it seems that spread we go that well 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:47.190
 well no longer but think about it I was 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.260
 investigating and actually in the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.989
 conversation we talked about the drawings of 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.750
 before they introduced classics in the life of 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.129
 the children explained to me because in mind the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.780
 vinillo now if you have fixed 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.000
 practically all the drawings of 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.059
 disney in this case are adaptations of 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.920
 classics to cartoons so that 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.110
 Children see us and get in touch 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.610
 with the culture of other countries of others 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.940
 ways of thinking 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.250
 etc. Normally this company used to 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.710
 because now I no longer pick classics from the 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.480
 Greek mythology and adapt them to what 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.490
 it's been in the cartoons 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.320
 for children that is the movie of 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.450
 pocahontas more than a reference to the 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.850
 Greek goddess is silent and is the movie of 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.250
 disney atlantis more than the history of 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.470
 the atlantis that lost city that 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.180
 it sank under the sea because of the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.670
 fury of the gods that is snow white 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.890
 more than a representation of the apple 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.140
 of the Greek discord that unleashed 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.210
 the trojan war later but disney 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.520
 not only took advantage of mythology 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.750
 Greek to get inspiration as well 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.060
 say it also adapted classics 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.190
 literary something that is being the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.200
 cartoon that is the lion king ' more 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.060
 what a shakespeare hamlet that is the lady 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.040
 and the vagabond more than an adaptation of 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.660
 romeo and julieta of this same author the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.820
 part of these drawings also we 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.479
 series are thousands more like and 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.490
 that is left mayer or heidi or frame by 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.710
 example the caves of these movies and 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.690
 series from before is that they introduced you 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.090
 values ​​to come from Greek mythology 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.160
 most resemble the fables that 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.000
 they are short stories that end with a 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.760
 moral 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.590
 and a value for you to learn in life 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.900
 pocahontas introduced the value of the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.850
 tolerance and love before people who do not 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.350
 is of your same race even in a 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.960
 totally entity scope and is and 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.240
 also ecologist robin hood introduced 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.070
 the value of justice and equality 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.360
 gabriela best at introduced the value of 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.310
 that beauty really is in the 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.770
 inside rather than outside as 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.900
 he imagined the hunchback of notredame and by 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.430
 example heidi introduces you the value of 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.959
 friendship and I also think that you 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.450
 enter the value of how you could 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.520
 Milking a goat like god 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.590
 come on, the girl takes me out of my 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.450
 boxes because she pulls me by the 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.780
 ravines that she likes and 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:57.450
 appear animal flowers that surround her 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.900
 and everything is great when I shot in the 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.690
 town I stumble over silvas stones and 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.780
 I end up in the river with a broken hand and 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.760
 well no no heidi we are going to be 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.140
 consistent if you throw yourself down a ravine 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.000
 but although it is a leg and also 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.160
 boat is entered the value that the 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.680
 love can travel any distance 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.180
 and that he would do anything to help 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.010
 his mother and also introduces us the 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.330
 value that an erasmus can make without 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.940
 a hard in the pocket and having to 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.770
 look after 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.900
 and that is called medium but obviously 

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:27.760
 everything has its bad part and wrote in 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.770
 these drawings was considered to 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.320
 traumatizes go to children in some 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.720
 occasions to me when I saw alicia in 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.250
 the wonderland ' I thought 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.350
 that the girl was drugged and in fact 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.150
 I was drugged, I would smoke some of them 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.760
 before going to sleep under the 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.400
 tree cited because the girl did not know 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.620
 you're welcome, the princess and the toad, my mother 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.570
 that's all filia bambi the death of the 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.820
 mother but how the children stay 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.370
 after watching an hour and the 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.230
 mother and the child, giving everything for 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.910
 the forest suddenly they catch and kill the 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.680
 mother but how can a child be left 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.870
 after that the hunchback of notredame 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.180
 but you have seen that movie 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.800
 whole for the love of god 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.900
 the poor little man I do not know how not to 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:10.270
 suicidal in the first ten minutes of 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.790
 the movie for the love of god look at you 

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:14.800
 I propose that you watch the song one day 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.450
 and I do not know what it's called but this 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.700
 song in which she sings quasimodo 

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:22.410
 when it's older, let's start, love 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:25.980

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:28.920

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.450
 I am here, I am another, there is no voucher 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.790
 well he is already being called marginalized 

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.290
 poor kid that is the summer and over 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.050

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.730

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:40.440

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.819
 and then the funny thing is that they go up 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:03.740
 of the bell tower and something like that goes behind 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:05.599
 in plan it does not happen of everything 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.090

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:09.500
 staircase you're deformed and quasiimodo I'm 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.439
 of fire 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.569
 but everything and very clear almost module is 

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:16.490
 singing a song to insult you 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:18.620

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.719

 all ugly child in the world I do not know how 

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:23.779
 almost when I had so much stamina 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:25.310
 after that song I took here and I 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.319
 threw down the first balcony of notredame 

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:29.120
 I love that is called abuse 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:30.830
 psychological and you quasimodo do not be silly 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.569
 and goal to report it because it seems is 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.729

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:37.699

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:39.550
 day treat children as if they were 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.920
 subnormal

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.850
 child to learn another language in this case 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.490

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.160

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:12.580

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.710
 girl is that for a child knows what it is 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:18.520
 a mountain so the next time 

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:20.280
 you get to where the mountain is, please 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.050
 try to prevent producers 

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.940

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.160

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:29.650
 mountain begins to talk I'm here I am 

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.170

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:34.840
 I am a mountain, do not you make a mistake, boy 

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:36.940
 Fuck the house of Mickey Mouse 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.010
 to see I put you in situation because it is 

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:41.440
 that I do not know how to describe this scene 

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.270
 There is a ravine and I have to spend it 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.080
 because on the other side this girl and I 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.319

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:57.680
 children and you good and you prepare for the 

00:06:55.159 --> 00:07:00.400

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.699
 with the bridge see with the rest the 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.699
 lookout 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:12.150
 You really have a child who believes 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:14.580
 that you can pass a ravine with a 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:16.890
 screwdriver does not and then use it 

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:19.380
 know is the tool say pepper 

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:20.880
 you can say paprika or you could 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.200
 say cinnamon or any of the 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:24.540
 spices that come to me in the 

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.220
 cojones ley chaitén happens that because it is 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.310
 an easy rhyme we have to use 

00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:32.220
 her conclusion of this blog parents 

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.670
 mothers of the world and of the tele to the 

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:37.530
 children when they are little and have them read 

00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:40.260
 classics but please do not do your 

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:42.090
 children grow watching cartoons that 

00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:44.070
 they tell the kid every now and then how 

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.470
 he has to clean his ass or how he has 

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:49.460
 to open a door as this is all 

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.460
 for today I hope you liked it 

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:55.279
 I do not have more full land I'm pretty 

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:56.330
 comforting to say goodbye so I think 

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:59.779
 that I 'm going to be looking at the horizon 

00:07:56.330 --> 00:08:02.029
 while I say goodbye you've had the 

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:04.219
 pleasure to see my man and month the channel 

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:06.370
 youtube in which sanity shines through 

00:08:04.219 --> 00:08:06.370
 your absence 

00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.539
 yes I am honest yes
