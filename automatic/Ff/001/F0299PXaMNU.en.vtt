window screen was outside as well and

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.600 
window screen was outside as well and
MBK<00:02:06.200> was<00:02:06.350> outside<00:02:06.590> so<00:02:06.890> they're<00:02:07.130> going<00:02:07.250> to<00:02:07.310> go

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
MBK was outside so they're going to go

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
through the vents area and existence is

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:11.740 
through the vents area and existence is
going<00:02:10.789> to<00:02:10.879> go<00:02:10.940> up<00:02:10.970> happen<00:02:11.269> after<00:02:11.450> getting<00:02:11.659> that

they<00:03:43.240> did<00:03:43.390> this<00:03:43.480> strategically<00:03:44.050> so<00:03:44.890> that<00:03:45.160> they

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:45.790 
they did this strategically so that they

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.900 
they did this strategically so that they
would<00:03:45.940> force<00:03:46.270> nip<00:03:46.600> into<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.110> third<00:03:47.500> round<00:03:47.650> by

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
would force nip into a third round by

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.820 
would force nip into a third round by
not<00:03:48.910> force<00:03:49.180> them<00:03:49.330> but<00:03:49.570> but<00:03:50.110> let<00:03:50.320> nip<00:03:50.530> think

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:50.830 
not force them but but let nip think

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:53.070 
not force them but but let nip think
that<00:03:51.040> they<00:03:51.190> could<00:03:51.250> throw<00:03:51.670> ground<00:03:51.910> by<00:03:52.060> and<00:03:52.330> when

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:53.080 
that they could throw ground by and when

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.160 
that they could throw ground by and when
pretty<00:03:53.350> easily<00:03:53.530> against<00:03:54.040> really<00:03:54.280> shitty<00:03:54.460> guns

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
pretty easily against really shitty guns

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.020 
pretty easily against really shitty guns
so<00:03:56.170> nip<00:03:56.410> does<00:03:56.770> third<00:03:57.220> round<00:03:57.430> by<00:03:57.580> even<00:03:57.940> though

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.030 
so nip does third round by even though

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.610 
so nip does third round by even though
they<00:03:58.150> didn't<00:03:58.330> get<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.510> bomb<00:03:58.690> down<00:03:58.900> first
