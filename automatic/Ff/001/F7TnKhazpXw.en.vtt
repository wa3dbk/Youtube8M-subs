picture<00:03:16.910> frame<00:03:17.410> so<00:03:18.410> it's<00:03:18.560> more<00:03:18.830> the<00:03:19.040> picture

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
picture frame so it's more the picture

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:21.640 
picture frame so it's more the picture
frame<00:03:19.730> than<00:03:20.000> an<00:03:20.150> actual<00:03:20.630> clock

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
frame than an actual clock

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.040 
frame than an actual clock
and<00:03:21.739> it<00:03:22.430> doesn't<00:03:22.730> have<00:03:22.820> numbers<00:03:23.450> on<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:23.930> it's

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:24.050 
and it doesn't have numbers on so it's

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:25.770 
and it doesn't have numbers on so it's
impossible<00:03:24.709> to<00:03:24.860> tell<00:03:25.070> what<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.340> time<00:03:25.730> is

completely<00:05:03.090> different<00:05:03.300> to<00:05:03.600> the<00:05:03.780> first<00:05:04.080> nice

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
completely different to the first nice

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.880 
completely different to the first nice
look<00:05:04.560> at<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:05.480> I'll<00:05:06.480> just<00:05:07.020> quickly<00:05:07.320> hopefully

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:07.890 
look at that I'll just quickly hopefully

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:10.040 
look at that I'll just quickly hopefully
can<00:05:08.280> see<00:05:08.490> the<00:05:08.610> cause<00:05:08.820> okay<00:05:09.090> from<00:05:09.630> that<00:05:09.690> to

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
can see the cause okay from that to

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.040 
can see the cause okay from that to
distance<00:05:10.530> because<00:05:11.420> it's<00:05:12.420> going<00:05:12.540> to<00:05:12.630> take<00:05:12.750> way

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:13.050 
distance because it's going to take way

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:15.920 
distance because it's going to take way
too<00:05:13.110> long<00:05:13.320> to<00:05:13.470> go<00:05:13.710> over<00:05:13.920> all<00:05:14.520> the<00:05:15.210> cards

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
too long to go over all the cards

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:19.130 
too long to go over all the cards
so<00:05:17.000> that's<00:05:18.000> good<00:05:18.150> enough<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.450> king<00:05:18.660> can<00:05:18.840> speak

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140
