00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.510
 our definition of sustainability 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.910
 means that we inherit the company 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.080
 able to lead the company is develey 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.380
 in Unterhaching 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.300
 These glasses are in a hurry because 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.380
 they want would be filled with the best 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:29.779
 Sweet white sausage mustard was invented 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.570
 In 1854 by Konrad evtl three years later 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.489
 followed by the white sausage and the Bavarian 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.160
 every time was born 

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.040
 the villa is today as a company 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.079
 and as a brand difficult to access on the 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.660
 one side we are as a company 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.579
 a brand and have product brands there 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.020
 Of course we are in Bavaria 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.680
 our regionality very strong 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.870
 represent 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.460
 on the other side we have the 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.559
 many other regional brands like 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.510
 baur lions fight woodpeckers where we go again 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.670
 in a completely different world quite different 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.190
 be perceived why try 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.829
 we will be very clear and the brands 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.180
 clean separate with own 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.399
 Production sites with their own 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.250
 strategies if own products 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.979
 each on the target group and on the 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.860
 markets tailored to nature and nature 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.229
 regionality of brands and locations 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.300
 the three pillars are straight at develey 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.940
 The mustard is one of the regional ones 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.190
 food ever any mustard and 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:28.009
 is the beautiful mustard and it is the 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.800
 reason why we too in the sam too 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.929
 Engage every mustard needs homeland and 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.929
 if you are the consumer and today 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:38.569
 give mustard homeland then they are turn 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.240
 relevant so you appreciate him sharp and 

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:44.090
 sweet dÃ¼sseldorf in bavaria or as 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.310
 universal spice in the east 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.549
 and that's how the grains are made 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.770
 We paint with spices like turmeric 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:55.159
 that makes the sharp mustard nice yellow 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.170
 then add water to it then 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.659
 he is allowed to mature before bottling 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.899
 The product will be available in two locations 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.369
 already produces co2 neutral but 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.880
 not only by compensating but 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:11.120
 that we once massively emit the co2 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.739
 have reduced completely new technologies 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.840
 We have used a complete one 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.720
 new 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.390
 refrigeration concept we have developed 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.319
 our production switched to 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.720
 geothermie Develey was founded in 1845 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:30.019
 was a royal bavarian court supplier 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.239
 The months went by and stayed with him 

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.379
 give them the family business and that 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.580
 should stay like this 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.920
 We have a family as one 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.470
 where exactly one 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.519
 succession regulation is regulated at the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.720
 we have another side 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:47.540
 successor program for each area and 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.940
 for any executive that us too 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.829
 there in the long term that we too there 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.989
 These are well positioned in the long term 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.140
 achieves a high training rate 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:59.299
 the fluctuation is low necessary 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.670
 Investments are mainly from the 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.319
 ongoing cash flow settled naturally 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.390
 we also finance one or the other 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:07.549
 history but primarily for 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:08.750
 We care that we are so fast 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:09.590
 grow as we do ourselves 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.750
 can finance 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.599
 Here is the viscosity of the mustard 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.860
 tested 5 inches in 30 seconds 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:18.140
 must create 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.690
 for the optimal plate performance 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:23.030
 almost a trifle but theirs 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:25.489
 contribution to the achievement of the goal makes 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:28.010
 that we are not just the consumer 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.079
 are in the head but also in the heart and 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.700
 that every product is a consumer 

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.170
 has relevance if we have these things 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.769
 we are also sustainable 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.769
 successfully
