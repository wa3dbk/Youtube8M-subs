00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
to a LED t8 lamp the reason we're going

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.330 
to a LED t8 lamp the reason we're going
to<00:00:10.260> do<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.710> we're<00:00:10.860> going<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.010> eliminate

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
to do this is we're going to eliminate

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.629 
to do this is we're going to eliminate
the<00:00:11.490> ballast<00:00:11.880> and<00:00:12.090> we're<00:00:12.990> going<00:00:13.110> to<00:00:13.200> use<00:00:13.639> 40%

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the ballast and we're going to use 40%

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.310 
the ballast and we're going to use 40%
less<00:00:14.759> energy<00:00:15.210> and<00:00:15.719> we're<00:00:15.870> going<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.049> convert

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
less energy and we're going to convert

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.310 
less energy and we're going to convert
to<00:00:16.440> LED<00:00:16.800> here's<00:00:17.640> how<00:00:17.789> we're<00:00:17.910> going<00:00:18.000> to<00:00:18.090> do<00:00:18.150> it

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.300 

first<00:00:22.320> thing<00:00:22.470> we're<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> proud<00:00:22.980> we're<00:00:23.189> going

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
first thing we're to proud we're going

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.130 
first thing we're to proud we're going
to<00:00:23.369> have<00:00:23.460> to<00:00:23.550> change<00:00:23.730> the<00:00:23.910> sockets<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.869> we<00:00:24.990> have

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
to have to change the sockets so we have

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.370 
to have to change the sockets so we have
three<00:00:25.740> non<00:00:26.160> shunted<00:00:26.789> sockets<00:00:27.300> because<00:00:28.050> this

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
three non shunted sockets because this

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.550 
three non shunted sockets because this
is<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> three<00:00:28.830> tube<00:00:29.039> fixture<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.439> we're<00:00:31.439> going

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
is a three tube fixture so we're going

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.580 
is a three tube fixture so we're going
to<00:00:31.640> take<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.700> wire<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.510> we<00:00:33.719> robbed<00:00:33.960> off<00:00:34.170> of<00:00:34.380> one

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
to take a wire that we robbed off of one

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.799 
to take a wire that we robbed off of one
of<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.739> ballast

ballast

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.199 

and<00:03:42.830> let's<00:03:43.340> put<00:03:43.580> the<00:03:44.180> positive<00:03:45.140> wire<00:03:46.150> on<00:03:47.150> one

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
and let's put the positive wire on one

00:03:47.209 --> 00:04:11.280 
and let's put the positive wire on one
side<00:03:51.430> and<00:03:52.430> the<00:03:53.330> negative<00:03:53.510> wire<00:03:54.790> on<00:03:55.790> this<00:03:56.000> side

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.400 

so<00:04:12.290> take<00:04:12.500> a<00:04:12.530> look<00:04:12.680> at<00:04:12.830> what<00:04:13.069> we<00:04:13.310> have<00:04:13.519> here<00:04:14.410> we

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
so take a look at what we have here we

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:19.240 
so take a look at what we have here we
have<00:04:16.419> the<00:04:17.419> positive<00:04:17.660> side<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.500> black<00:04:18.739> wire<00:04:18.979> is

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250 
have the positive side the black wire is

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.420 
have the positive side the black wire is
actually<00:04:19.970> going<00:04:20.570> to<00:04:21.410> the<00:04:21.590> left<00:04:21.950> side<00:04:22.160> of<00:04:22.220> the

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
actually going to the left side of the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.150 
actually going to the left side of the
socket<00:04:22.669> to<00:04:23.030> that<00:04:23.180> side<00:04:23.479> to<00:04:24.350> that<00:04:24.470> side<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:24.800> to

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
socket to that side to that side and to

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.879 
socket to that side to that side and to
that<00:04:25.310> side<00:04:25.580> through<00:04:26.240> this<00:04:26.360> wiring<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:26.990> the

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
that side through this wiring and the

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.270 
that side through this wiring and the
white<00:04:28.639> wire<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.450> common<00:04:29.870> wire<00:04:30.050> is<00:04:30.350> on<00:04:31.160> the

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
white wire the common wire is on the

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.129 
white wire the common wire is on the
right<00:04:31.460> side<00:04:31.700> of<00:04:31.790> the<00:04:31.850> socket<00:04:32.090> going<00:04:32.720> to<00:04:32.990> that

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:33.139 
right side of the socket going to that

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:36.850 
right side of the socket going to that
wire<00:04:33.380> to<00:04:34.160> that<00:04:34.190> side<00:04:34.580> and<00:04:35.180> to<00:04:35.270> that<00:04:35.419> side<00:04:35.860> okay

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
wire to that side and to that side okay

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.000 
wire to that side and to that side okay
so<00:04:37.700> let's<00:04:38.510> fold<00:04:38.750> our<00:04:38.900> wires<00:04:39.110> up<00:04:39.440> and<00:04:39.710> we'll

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
so let's fold our wires up and we'll

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:46.670 
so let's fold our wires up and we'll
install<00:04:40.220> this<00:04:40.520> we're<00:04:40.940> ready<00:04:41.120> to<00:04:41.210> go

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:54.439 

I<00:04:51.620> folded<00:04:52.620> all<00:04:52.770> the<00:04:52.860> wires<00:04:53.040> so<00:04:53.940> it's<00:04:54.060> nice<00:04:54.240> and

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:54.449 
I folded all the wires so it's nice and

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:59.779 
I folded all the wires so it's nice and
neat<00:04:54.540> so<00:04:55.289> we<00:04:55.410> could<00:04:55.530> just<00:04:55.620> put<00:04:55.830> that<00:04:55.949> up<00:04:58.669> we<00:04:59.669> are

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
neat so we could just put that up we are

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.330 
neat so we could just put that up we are
all<00:04:59.970> wired<00:05:00.300> up<00:05:00.600> and<00:05:01.229> let's<00:05:01.710> put<00:05:01.949> those<00:05:02.039> lamps

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:02.340 
all wired up and let's put those lamps

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.580 
all wired up and let's put those lamps
in<00:05:02.580> now<00:05:03.889> so<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:05.490> lamps<00:05:06.060> have<00:05:06.270> an<00:05:06.479> L<00:05:06.930> and<00:05:07.289> an<00:05:07.410> N

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
in now so the lamps have an L and an N

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:10.520 
in now so the lamps have an L and an N
over<00:05:07.949> here<00:05:08.370> which<00:05:08.759> is<00:05:08.789> loaded<00:05:09.150> neutral<00:05:09.660> so<00:05:10.169> the

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
over here which is loaded neutral so the

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.320 
over here which is loaded neutral so the
positive<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:11.100> negative<00:05:11.400> wires<00:05:11.430> that<00:05:12.210> we

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
positive and negative wires that we

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.090 
positive and negative wires that we
connect<00:05:12.630> it<00:05:12.780> to<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.050> side<00:05:13.289> will<00:05:13.740> go<00:05:13.860> to<00:05:13.919> this

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
connect it to the side will go to this

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.490 
connect it to the side will go to this
side<00:05:14.310> not<00:05:15.150> to<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.479> side<00:05:15.720> because<00:05:15.960> this<00:05:16.259> side

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
side not to the side because this side

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.950 
side not to the side because this side
is<00:05:16.710> now<00:05:16.860> just<00:05:17.190> supporting<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.639> lamp<00:05:17.910> so<00:05:18.750> here

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
is now just supporting the lamp so here

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:34.610 
is now just supporting the lamp so here
we<00:05:19.050> go<00:05:32.630> now<00:05:33.630> you<00:05:33.690> know<00:05:33.810> what<00:05:34.020> we<00:05:34.169> forgot<00:05:34.289> to<00:05:34.440> put
