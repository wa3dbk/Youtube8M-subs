00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.769
 friends how are the birds are and 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.599
 they will be reptiles or at least so 

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:09.599
 consider the biological system 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.119
 systematics is a branch of the 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.750
 biology that studies the classification of 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:22.660
 species based on their evolutionary history 

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:26.200
 the classification is to be able to determine a 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:28.450
 kingdom division class order family 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.550
 agent and species by the 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:34.420
 characteristics that are assigned to each 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.790
 group for example all mammals or 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.699
 six moms three bones in the middle video 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.269
 and a bony mandible or the 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.879
 dinosaurs have three or four fingers 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.920
 less developed upper limbs 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.500
 skull day have been terrestrial habitat 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.780
 among many other features 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.390
 with the different groups you can 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.150
 create ordered trees called clear 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.850
 dramas that are used to approximate and 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.770
 associate genera or species based on their 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.230
 similarities 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.940
 since the birds share a lot of 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.670
 characteristics with some groups of 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:13.730
 reptiles would be logical to think and the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.550
 fossil record thus proves that some 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.690
 organisms that gave rise to the birds 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.690
 they were reptiles 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.460
 these individuals that give rise to one or 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.800
 more groups of organisms through 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.630
 evolutionary processes are called 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.390
 common ancestor 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.250
 nowadays the term birds is very 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.799
 used to define animals with 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.130
 feathers but not very appropriate since 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:44.320
 there have been reptiles with feathers the beak 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.610
 neither is it exclusive of what we 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.610
 we call birds 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.340
 but because we say that man does not 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.230
 Descends from the chimpanzee monkey 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.260
 simply because no monkey would be 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.880
 able to give light to a human as well as 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.920
 no chimpanzee would be able to 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.630
 become a human throughout 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.120
 his life 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.550
 we are different species and as such 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.370
 we just have a common ancestor that we 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.560
 links with the rest of the domains 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:17.080
 I know that most think of humans 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.269
 when I say minimum but for the same 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.030
 reason that the birds are a group of 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.080
 reptiles the domains are a group 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:28.069
 formed by 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:31.830
 orangutans gorillas chimpanzees and humans 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.870
 and if we look at clear grama are the 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.330
 chimpanzees the closest to the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:39.709
 men and where the link would be 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.709
 lost here 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.750
 for years it was thought that man 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.240
 presented more similarities with the 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.520
 common chimpanzee making it our group 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.560
 closest but there has always been 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.160
 controversy because of the behavior 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.030
 little peaceful of the chimpanzees 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.680
 characteristics that the experts 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.680
 they consider little human 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.860
 in recent years it has been studied 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.019
 a lot to the special good bonus of 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:13.870
 Chimps that presents the same level 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:16.810
 of genetic similarity and behavior 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:20.760
 social similar to human based on 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.410
 sex although this is just a theory 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.930
 as another one where it is proposed that the 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.190
 humans are a larval state of the 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:33.849
 chimpanzees known as neotenia tal 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:37.840
 as well as a nymph to a dragonfly or a 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:41.080
 absolute to a salamander 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.540
 to finish two curious facts about 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.370
 all humans of all men 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.640
 that have existed on the face of the 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.780
 land 93 percent of them have 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.930
 dead 

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:55.390
 and it is not new that the age of man 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.510
 it increases every century but 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:02.800
 statistically it is very likely that the 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:06.100
 longest man for the year 2100 be 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.670
 I live at this moment and be some of 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.280
 we 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.310
 and keep being human we see the 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.310
 next 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.500
 do not
