to<00:05:59.000> me<00:05:59.090> to<00:05:59.330> fight<00:05:59.570> run<00:06:00.020> around<00:06:00.230> the<00:06:00.290> lots<00:06:00.530> so<00:06:01.520> if

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:01.670 
to me to fight run around the lots so if

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.660 
to me to fight run around the lots so if
so<00:06:02.450> if<00:06:02.480> maaga<00:06:02.840> will<00:06:03.380> get<00:06:03.530> royalty<00:06:04.250> if<00:06:04.370> he<00:06:04.490> does

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.670 
so if maaga will get royalty if he does

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:07.480

get<00:06:04.820> tired<00:06:05.120> I'm<00:06:05.360> going<00:06:05.390> to<00:06:05.570> be<00:06:06.370> kind<00:06:07.370> of

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
get tired I'm going to be kind of

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.040 
get tired I'm going to be kind of
screwed<00:06:07.820> I<00:06:08.060> guess<00:06:08.330> if<00:06:08.480> you<00:06:08.570> want<00:06:08.720> to<00:06:08.780> say<00:06:08.870> that

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:09.050 
screwed I guess if you want to say that

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:10.750 
screwed I guess if you want to say that
but<00:06:09.800> the<00:06:09.890> thinking<00:06:10.040> I<00:06:10.190> can<00:06:10.370> always<00:06:10.610> use<00:06:10.730> the

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
but the thinking I can always use the

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.390 
but the thinking I can always use the
defense<00:06:11.270> from<00:06:11.450> the<00:06:11.600> uke<00:06:11.810> so<00:06:12.370> which<00:06:13.370> is

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:13.400 
defense from the uke so which is

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:17.860 
defense from the uke so which is
basically<00:06:13.910> impregnable<00:06:16.090> Thunder<00:06:17.090> Road<00:06:17.300> we
