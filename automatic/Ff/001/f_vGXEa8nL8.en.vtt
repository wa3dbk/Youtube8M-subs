just give you a quick looks like on the

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:25.100 
just give you a quick looks like on the
tank<00:01:20.600> I'll<00:01:21.600> let<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> camera<00:01:22.290> just<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:23.960> likes<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
tank I'll let the camera just it likes a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.260 
tank I'll let the camera just it likes a
tank<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.560> credibly<00:01:25.920> well<00:01:26.540> does<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.570> good<00:01:27.780> job

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
tank and credibly well does a good job

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.840 
tank and credibly well does a good job
right<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.450> tank<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:30.930> think<00:01:31.670> don't<00:01:32.670> know<00:01:32.820> a

right in the tank I think don't know a
lot<00:01:33.090> too<00:01:33.329> much<00:01:33.479> about<00:01:33.630> LEDs<00:01:34.049> per<00:01:34.880> arrived<00:01:35.880> in

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
lot too much about LEDs per arrived in

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.179 
lot too much about LEDs per arrived in
some

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
slowly though for my SPS is there and my

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.520 
slowly though for my SPS is there and my
money<00:01:46.880> poorer<00:01:47.240> the<00:01:48.020> one<00:01:48.140> at<00:01:48.259> the<00:01:48.289> back<00:01:48.469> of

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
money poorer the one at the back of

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.169 
money poorer the one at the back of
bleach<00:01:48.829> that<00:01:49.219> that's<00:01:49.429> been<00:01:49.579> bleached<00:01:49.880> for<00:01:50.119> a

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
doing well I think he's these two birds

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:58.209 
doing well I think he's these two birds
nest<00:01:54.939> but<00:01:55.939> great<00:01:56.299> growth<00:01:56.990> this<00:01:57.709> one<00:01:57.890> here

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
nest but great growth this one here

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.179 
nest but great growth this one here
beyond<00:01:58.789> the<00:01:58.880> clowns<00:01:59.170> I'm<00:02:00.170> not<00:02:00.469> sure<00:02:00.770> what<00:02:00.979> late

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
beyond the clowns I'm not sure what late

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.309 
beyond the clowns I'm not sure what late
at<00:02:01.609> some<00:02:01.789> kind<00:02:02.060> of<00:02:02.090> SPS<00:02:02.509> but<00:02:02.750> that's<00:02:02.990> growing

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
at some kind of SPS but that's growing

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.410 
at some kind of SPS but that's growing
and<00:02:04.159> crusting<00:02:04.579> onto<00:02:04.819> the<00:02:04.880> rocks<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:05.270> looks

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
and crusting onto the rocks that looks

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.850 
and crusting onto the rocks that looks
like<00:02:05.569> it's<00:02:05.719> growing<00:02:05.869> every<00:02:06.079> day

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:08.860 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.030 

LPS<00:02:10.090> softies<00:02:11.090> are<00:02:11.239> doing<00:02:11.480> all<00:02:11.569> right<00:02:12.040> being

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
LPS softies are doing all right being

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.670 
LPS softies are doing all right being
soft<00:02:13.370> knees<00:02:13.519> have<00:02:13.670> got<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.819> new<00:02:14.379> another<00:02:15.379> green

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
soft knees have got a new another green

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.360 
soft knees have got a new another green
montipora

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
montipora

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.080 
montipora
I've<00:02:16.610> only<00:02:17.120> just<00:02:17.209> put<00:02:17.480> in<00:02:17.599> the<00:02:17.690> tank<00:02:18.519> but<00:02:19.519> yeah

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
I've only just put in the tank but yeah

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.839 
I've only just put in the tank but yeah
I<00:02:20.470> think<00:02:21.470> it<00:02:21.739> does<00:02:21.860> like<00:02:22.099> this<00:02:22.310> like<00:02:22.700> the

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
I think it does like this like the

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.280 
I think it does like this like the
aquarium<00:02:23.209> losses<00:02:23.540> this<00:02:23.780> is<00:02:23.930> 200<00:02:24.470> liter<00:02:24.620> tank

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
aquarium losses this is 200 liter tank

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.619 
aquarium losses this is 200 liter tank
and<00:02:27.290> I<00:02:27.410> think<00:02:27.620> it<00:02:27.709> lights<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.420> lights<00:02:29.420> up

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
and I think it lights it lights up

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:35.190 
and I think it lights it lights up
incredibly<00:02:30.140> well<00:02:32.950> that's<00:02:33.950> all<00:02:34.099> it<00:02:34.220> is<00:02:34.310> they're

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
incredibly well that's all it is they're

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.960 
incredibly well that's all it is they're
not<00:02:36.200> very<00:02:36.379> big<00:02:36.560> fixture<00:02:36.980> but<00:02:37.340> for<00:02:37.549> the<00:02:37.609> like<00:02:37.819> it

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
not very big fixture but for the like it

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.190 
not very big fixture but for the like it
sticks<00:02:38.239> out<00:02:38.390> I<00:02:38.450> think<00:02:38.599> it's<00:02:38.870> quite<00:02:39.079> incredible

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
sticks out I think it's quite incredible

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.099 
sticks out I think it's quite incredible
really<00:02:40.959> extends<00:02:41.959> on<00:02:42.049> these<00:02:42.200> arms<00:02:43.900> go<00:02:44.900> right

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:45.109 
really extends on these arms go right

00:02:45.109 --> 00:02:48.520 
really extends on these arms go right
out<00:02:45.430> that's<00:02:46.430> how<00:02:46.489> big<00:02:46.670> you<00:02:47.349> cleanse<00:02:48.349> every

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
out that's how big you cleanse every

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.699 
out that's how big you cleanse every
good<00:02:48.680> tank<00:02:49.040> is<00:02:49.900> but<00:02:50.900> yeah<00:02:52.599> bulbs<00:02:53.599> inside<00:02:54.049> and

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
good tank is but yeah bulbs inside and

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:58.030 
good tank is but yeah bulbs inside and

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.849 
flew high for ties or if that's true or
not<00:03:06.079> is<00:03:06.290> a<00:03:06.319> different<00:03:06.680> story<00:03:07.489> but<00:03:07.970> I<00:03:08.739> think<00:03:09.739> it

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
not is a different story but I think it

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:12.839 
not is a different story but I think it
looks<00:03:10.010> looks<00:03:10.519> pretty<00:03:10.790> good<00:03:11.030> really<00:03:11.269> the

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849
