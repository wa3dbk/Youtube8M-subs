is exactly what I was looking for and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.550 
is exactly what I was looking for and
what<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.000> shows<00:00:27.240> is<00:00:27.269> if<00:00:27.720> you<00:00:27.930> take<00:00:28.140> the<00:00:28.260> stills

what it shows is if you take the stills

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.580 
what it shows is if you take the stills
from<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.039> and<00:00:29.599> you<00:00:30.599> plug<00:00:30.869> them<00:00:31.019> into<00:00:31.199> this

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
from this and you plug them into this

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.069 
from this and you plug them into this
photo<00:00:32.340> forensics<00:00:32.910> as<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.660> can<00:00:33.780> see<00:00:33.930> right

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
photo forensics as you can see right

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.610 
photo forensics as you can see right
here<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:35.070> take<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.430> original<00:00:36.380> you<00:00:37.380> can<00:00:37.410> get

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
here you take the original you can get

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.090 
here you take the original you can get
all<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.829> information<00:00:37.950> on<00:00:38.460> it<00:00:38.520> size<00:00:39.300> JPEG

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
all the information on it size JPEG

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.850 
all the information on it size JPEG
bytes<00:00:41.510> but<00:00:42.510> when<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.719> break<00:00:42.930> it<00:00:43.079> down<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.829> can

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
bytes but when you break it down you can

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.029 
bytes but when you break it down you can
see<00:00:44.040> clearly<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.120> check<00:00:45.450> that<00:00:45.690> out<00:00:47.719> that<00:00:49.039> it

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
see clearly and check that out that it

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.420 
see clearly and check that out that it
just<00:00:50.670> stands<00:00:51.329> out<00:00:51.600> bigger<00:00:52.190> than<00:00:53.190> anything

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
just stands out bigger than anything

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.900 
just stands out bigger than anything
that<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.660> whole<00:00:54.870> thing<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.440> different<00:00:56.430> and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
that this whole thing is different and

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.380 
that this whole thing is different and
this<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:57.870> when<00:00:58.170> this<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:58.949> what<00:00:59.309> experts<00:01:00.180> would

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
this is when this is what experts would

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.459 
this is when this is what experts would
look<00:01:00.570> for<00:01:00.780> if<00:01:00.870> they<00:01:01.020> were<00:01:01.050> going<00:01:01.350> through

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
look for if they were going through

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.770 
look for if they were going through
looking<00:01:01.980> for<00:01:02.219> manipulation<00:01:02.879> looking<00:01:03.600> for

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
looking for manipulation looking for

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.929 
looking for manipulation looking for
Photoshop<00:01:04.530> things<00:01:05.430> that<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.670> nature

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
Photoshop things that that nature

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.179 
Photoshop things that that nature
drastic<00:01:06.659> differences<00:01:07.350> now<00:01:07.680> yes<00:01:07.950> they're

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
drastic differences now yes they're

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.649 
drastic differences now yes they're
birds<00:01:08.400> they<00:01:08.640> give<00:01:08.820> off<00:01:08.970> heat<00:01:09.240> but<00:01:09.479> there's

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
birds they give off heat but there's

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:10.850 
birds they give off heat but there's
also<00:01:09.810> other<00:01:10.049> things<00:01:10.170> out<00:01:10.500> there<00:01:10.530> that<00:01:10.770> will

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
also other things out there that will

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.710 
also other things out there that will
give<00:01:10.890> off<00:01:11.159> heat<00:01:11.689> in<00:01:12.689> in<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:14.010> daytime<00:01:14.720> there's

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
give off heat in in the daytime there's

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.570 
give off heat in in the daytime there's
going<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> be<00:01:15.990> materials<00:01:16.890> concrete<00:01:17.460> and

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
going to be materials concrete and

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.370 
going to be materials concrete and
things<00:01:17.759> out<00:01:17.939> there<00:01:18.090> that<00:01:18.240> hold<00:01:18.479> more<00:01:18.810> heat<00:01:18.869> in

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
things out there that hold more heat in

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.039 
things out there that hold more heat in
them<00:01:20.000> than<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.090> birds<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.479> the<00:01:21.540> atmosphere

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
them than the birds in the atmosphere

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.350 
them than the birds in the atmosphere
and<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:22.860> thing<00:01:23.070> that<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.400> you<00:01:24.090> should<00:01:24.270> be

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
and the one thing that you you should be

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.420 
and the one thing that you you should be
able<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.780> here<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.890> birds<00:01:26.130> are

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
able to see here is that the birds are

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.060 
able to see here is that the birds are
obviously<00:01:27.270> thicker<00:01:27.659> in<00:01:27.930> some<00:01:28.140> spots<00:01:28.470> very

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
obviously thicker in some spots very

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.700 
obviously thicker in some spots very
thin<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.790> others<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.390> right<00:01:30.630> up<00:01:30.750> here<00:01:31.110> on

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
thin and others like right up here on

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.550 
thin and others like right up here on
this<00:01:31.979> right<00:01:32.220> side<00:01:32.250> at<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:32.729> top<00:01:32.939> very<00:01:33.840> few<00:01:34.290> but

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
this right side at the top very few but

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.370 
this right side at the top very few but
yet<00:01:35.180> the<00:01:36.180> whole<00:01:36.360> blob<00:01:36.659> remains<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.320> same<00:01:39.380> this

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
yet the whole blob remains the same this

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.440 
yet the whole blob remains the same this
is<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.920> type<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.130> evidence<00:01:41.579> you're<00:01:42.180> looking

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
is the type of evidence you're looking

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.679 
is the type of evidence you're looking
for<00:01:42.659> so<00:01:42.930> for<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:44.130> folks<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.759> shot<00:01:45.420> this

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
for so for the folks that shot this

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.810 
for so for the folks that shot this
video<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:47.340> they've<00:01:47.460> got<00:01:47.490> like<00:01:47.790> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
video and that they've got like a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.420 
video and that they've got like a
million<00:01:48.390> or<00:01:48.630> more<00:01:48.780> views<00:01:49.140> on<00:01:49.770> it<00:01:50.070> out<00:01:50.189> there

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
million or more views on it out there

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.100 
million or more views on it out there
and<00:01:50.700> I<00:01:51.090> think<00:01:51.420> it's<00:01:51.720> only<00:01:51.840> 11<00:01:52.200> seconds<00:01:52.530> long

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
and I think it's only 11 seconds long

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.910 
and I think it's only 11 seconds long
you<00:01:55.110> can<00:01:55.290> take<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:55.740> back<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.310> them<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.759> in

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
you can take this back to them and in

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.310 
you can take this back to them and in
try<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:58.950> get<00:01:59.100> an<00:01:59.250> answer<00:02:02.030> here<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.180> go<00:02:03.360> okay
