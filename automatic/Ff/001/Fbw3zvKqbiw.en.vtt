00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
order to take the special move because

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.080

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
go for hidden power rice because I feel

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.160

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
guess he expected me to go for an

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.630 
guess he expected me to go for an
electric<00:01:21.630> move<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.140> here<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:22.710> just<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.460> case

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
predicted that and went for the hidden

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.050 
predicted that and went for the hidden
power<00:01:30.390> fire<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:31.229> hidden<00:01:31.770> power<00:01:32.100> fire<00:01:32.400> with

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
power fire but hidden power fire with

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.510 
power fire but hidden power fire with
screens<00:01:33.570> does<00:01:34.020> not<00:01:34.229> do<00:01:34.470> a<00:01:34.500> lot<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.950> Pharaoh<00:01:35.220> see

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
screens does not do a lot to Pharaoh see

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.219 
screens does not do a lot to Pharaoh see
it<00:01:35.579> at<00:01:35.729> all<00:01:35.759> because<00:01:36.180> Pharaoh<00:01:36.659> seed<00:01:36.990> is<00:01:37.200> a

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
it at all because Pharaoh seed is a

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.760 
it at all because Pharaoh seed is a
beast<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.729> decide<00:01:39.420> here's<00:01:39.900> a<00:01:40.229> good

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
beast so I decide here's a good

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.069 
beast so I decide here's a good
opportunity<00:01:41.070> for<00:01:41.490> me<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:41.850> set<00:01:42.150> up<00:01:42.180> my<00:01:42.299> spikes<00:01:42.780> I

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
opportunity for me to set up my spikes I

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.800 
opportunity for me to set up my spikes I
know<00:01:43.560> he<00:01:43.920> has<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.220> rapid<00:01:44.909> spinner<00:01:45.149> on<00:01:45.270> his<00:01:45.479> team

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
know he has a rapid spinner on his team

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.139 
know he has a rapid spinner on his team
centuries<00:01:46.649> probably<00:01:47.040> his<00:01:47.159> rapid<00:01:47.549> spinner<00:01:47.790> but

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
centuries probably his rapid spinner but

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.539 
centuries probably his rapid spinner but
I<00:01:48.450> can<00:01:48.960> easily<00:01:49.200> block<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.890> with<00:01:50.040> frill<00:01:50.369> ish

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
I can easily block that with frill ish

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.359 
I can easily block that with frill ish
so<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:50.820> feel<00:01:51.149> safe<00:01:51.479> just<00:01:51.930> letting<00:01:52.439> Pharaoh<00:01:53.040> seat

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369

still<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:41.180> i<00:02:41.209> switch<00:02:41.870> into<00:02:42.200> carb<00:02:42.530> and<00:02:42.830> I<00:02:43.100> switch

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 
still so i switch into carb and I switch

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.150 
still so i switch into carb and I switch
carvanha<00:02:43.910> into<00:02:44.720> gliscor<00:02:45.560> fearing<00:02:46.040> the

carvanha into gliscor fearing the
electric<00:02:46.670> move<00:02:46.910> and<00:02:47.180> he<00:02:47.510> does<00:02:47.750> go<00:02:47.989> for<00:02:48.260> both

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:48.440 
electric move and he does go for both

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.199 
electric move and he does go for both
switch<00:02:48.800> so<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.130> doesn't<00:02:49.459> affect<00:02:49.730> Gliscor

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
switch so it doesn't affect Gliscor

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.720 
switch so it doesn't affect Gliscor

like he's going to try and rapid spin
away<00:03:05.870> on<00:03:06.230> my<00:03:06.440> entry<00:03:06.830> hazards<00:03:07.250> and<00:03:07.810> here<00:03:08.810> I

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
away on my entry hazards and here I

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.600 
away on my entry hazards and here I
decided<00:03:09.260> to<00:03:09.350> go<00:03:09.470> for<00:03:09.709> will-o-wisp<00:03:10.280> with

decided to go for will-o-wisp with

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.580 
decided to go for will-o-wisp with
relish<00:03:11.239> because<00:03:11.630> sanctuary<00:03:12.230> is<00:03:12.290> probably

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
relish because sanctuary is probably

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.970 
relish because sanctuary is probably
physical<00:03:13.160> and<00:03:13.510> he<00:03:14.510> is<00:03:14.630> physical<00:03:15.230> so<00:03:15.500> his<00:03:15.680> night

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:15.980 
physical and he is physical so his night

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.520 
physical and he is physical so his night
/<00:03:16.340> does<00:03:16.610> not<00:03:16.820> do<00:03:17.060> anything<00:03:17.390> and<00:03:17.720> unfortunately

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
/ does not do anything and unfortunately

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.130 
/ does not do anything and unfortunately
for<00:03:18.860> him<00:03:19.010> night<00:03:19.489> /<00:03:19.880> was<00:03:20.120> disabled<00:03:20.690> by<00:03:20.750> cursed

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
for him night / was disabled by cursed

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.470 
for him night / was disabled by cursed
body<00:03:21.500> I<00:03:21.799> think<00:03:22.340> cursed<00:03:22.610> body<00:03:22.940> has<00:03:23.239> like<00:03:23.450> a

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
body I think cursed body has like a

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.930 
body I think cursed body has like a
thirty<00:03:23.810> percent<00:03:24.230> chance<00:03:24.560> of<00:03:24.860> being<00:03:25.130> disabled

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
thirty percent chance of being disabled

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.120 
thirty percent chance of being disabled
so<00:03:26.510> he<00:03:26.630> goes<00:03:26.780> into<00:03:27.110> squirtle<00:03:27.590> fearing<00:03:28.010> the

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
so he goes into squirtle fearing the

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.880 
so he goes into squirtle fearing the
water<00:03:28.400> move<00:03:28.760> and<00:03:29.110> squirtle<00:03:30.110> does<00:03:30.290> resist<00:03:30.739> it

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
water move and squirtle does resist it

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.440 
water move and squirtle does resist it
but<00:03:31.040> it<00:03:31.130> still<00:03:31.400> does<00:03:31.610> a<00:03:31.640> decent<00:03:32.120> amount<00:03:32.209> of

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 
but it still does a decent amount of

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:35.320 
but it still does a decent amount of
damage<00:03:32.870> and<00:03:33.049> he<00:03:34.040> does<00:03:34.280> have<00:03:34.459> Oran<00:03:34.880> berry<00:03:35.150> on

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.330 
damage and he does have Oran berry on

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.539 
damage and he does have Oran berry on
squirtle<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.200> I<00:03:36.500> decided<00:03:37.040> to<00:03:37.160> just<00:03:37.190> hit

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
squirtle so I decided to just hit

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.630 
squirtle so I decided to just hit
squirtle<00:03:38.269> right<00:03:39.079> now<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.709> see<00:03:40.400> what<00:03:40.549> he<00:03:40.610> has

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
squirtle right now and see what he has

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.220 
squirtle right now and see what he has
because<00:03:41.120> I<00:03:41.209> don't<00:03:41.360> really<00:03:41.480> think<00:03:41.720> he<00:03:41.900> can<00:03:42.019> hit

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
because I don't really think he can hit

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.319 
because I don't really think he can hit
me<00:03:42.380> and<00:03:42.560> he<00:03:42.680> does<00:03:42.950> go<00:03:43.190> for<00:03:43.459> ice<00:03:43.610> punch<00:03:44.030> and<00:03:44.269> I

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
me and he does go for ice punch and I

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.390 
me and he does go for ice punch and I
sponge<00:03:44.690> does<00:03:44.900> not<00:03:45.170> do<00:03:45.380> anything<00:03:45.650> at<00:03:45.920> all<00:03:46.070> to<00:03:46.280> me

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
sponge does not do anything at all to me

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.729 
sponge does not do anything at all to me
and<00:03:46.700> he<00:03:47.239> sends<00:03:47.510> on<00:03:47.660> me<00:03:47.810> out<00:03:47.930> predicting<00:03:48.530> me<00:03:48.620> to

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
and he sends on me out predicting me to

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:50.590 
and he sends on me out predicting me to
go<00:03:48.860> for<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.070> Shadow<00:03:49.370> Ball<00:03:49.579> again<00:03:49.910> and<00:03:50.239> because

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:50.600 
go for the Shadow Ball again and because

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.229 
go for the Shadow Ball again and because
meows<00:03:51.170> is<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.560> normal<00:03:52.040> type<00:03:52.310> and<00:03:52.670> shadow<00:03:52.970> ball

affect<00:03:55.160> him<00:03:55.640> and<00:03:55.880> I<00:03:56.540> go<00:03:56.720> into<00:03:56.900> my<00:03:57.110> Gliscor

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440

fearing<00:03:58.160> a<00:03:58.250> physical<00:03:58.760> move<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.239> it<00:03:59.329> goes

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
fearing a physical move and it goes

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.690 
fearing a physical move and it goes
through<00:03:59.690> a<00:03:59.720> u-turn<00:04:00.140> so<00:04:00.560> being<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.310> Flying<00:04:01.610> type

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
through a u-turn so being a Flying type

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.150 
through a u-turn so being a Flying type
I<00:04:02.000> also<00:04:02.239> resists<00:04:03.019> that<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:04.250> it<00:04:04.400> goes<00:04:04.640> in<00:04:05.030> to

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
I also resists that and it goes in to

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.370 
I also resists that and it goes in to
squirtle<00:04:07.570> probably<00:04:08.570> trying<00:04:08.930> to<00:04:09.019> go<00:04:09.170> for

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:09.380 
squirtle probably trying to go for

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.530 
squirtle probably trying to go for
another<00:04:09.500> ice<00:04:09.890> punch<00:04:10.340> but<00:04:10.610> I<00:04:10.670> stay<00:04:10.970> in<00:04:11.150> because

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
another ice punch but I stay in because

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.600 
another ice punch but I stay in because
I<00:04:11.690> figure<00:04:12.019> I<00:04:12.049> can<00:04:12.200> maybe<00:04:12.530> live<00:04:12.860> at<00:04:13.040> least<00:04:13.280> one

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:13.610 
I figure I can maybe live at least one

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.140 
I figure I can maybe live at least one
because<00:04:14.120> I'm<00:04:14.329> evo<00:04:14.780> late<00:04:15.100> so<00:04:16.100> I<00:04:16.549> actually<00:04:16.820> out

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
because I'm evo late so I actually out

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.479 
because I'm evo late so I actually out
speed<00:04:17.540> it<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.900> go<00:04:18.049> for<00:04:18.320> an<00:04:18.410> aerialist<00:04:18.859> and<00:04:19.400> he

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
speed it and go for an aerialist and he

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.099 
speed it and go for an aerialist and he
sends<00:04:19.789> in<00:04:19.970> Joel<00:04:20.330> ticks

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
sends in Joel ticks

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.089 
sends in Joel ticks
I<00:04:21.169> figure<00:04:21.979> I'm<00:04:22.219> going<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.490> switch<00:04:22.939> because

00:04:24.089 --> 00:04:24.099 
I figure I'm going to switch because

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:26.980 
I figure I'm going to switch because
clogger<00:04:25.099> cannot<00:04:25.580> take<00:04:25.879> special<00:04:26.270> hits<00:04:26.659> very

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.559 
clogger cannot take special hits very
well<00:04:27.289> it's<00:04:27.560> more<00:04:27.800> of<00:04:27.889> a<00:04:27.949> physical<00:04:28.159> and<00:04:28.699> I<00:04:29.389> go

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:29.569 
well it's more of a physical and I go

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.570 
well it's more of a physical and I go
into<00:04:29.719> my<00:04:29.900> foolish<00:04:30.409> thinking<00:04:30.919> maybe<00:04:31.159> hidden

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580 
into my foolish thinking maybe hidden

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.959 
into my foolish thinking maybe hidden
power<00:04:31.819> ice<00:04:32.120> again<00:04:32.960> on<00:04:33.289> glist<00:04:33.830> scores<00:04:34.159> so<00:04:34.580> he

00:04:34.959 --> 00:04:34.969 
power ice again on glist scores so he

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:36.640 
power ice again on glist scores so he
actually<00:04:35.120> predicts<00:04:35.780> that<00:04:35.870> and<00:04:36.199> goes<00:04:36.349> for<00:04:36.379> an

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
actually predicts that and goes for an

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.950 
actually predicts that and goes for an
energy<00:04:37.039> ball<00:04:37.449> unfortunately<00:04:38.449> the<00:04:38.599> energy

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
energy ball unfortunately the energy

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.050 
energy ball unfortunately the energy
ball<00:04:39.139> gets<00:04:39.349> disabled<00:04:40.009> by<00:04:40.129> cursed<00:04:40.460> body<00:04:40.729> so

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
ball gets disabled by cursed body so

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.580 
ball gets disabled by cursed body so
he's<00:04:41.180> left<00:04:41.449> his<00:04:41.599> struggle<00:04:42.139> because<00:04:42.409> he's

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
he's left his struggle because he's

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.369 
he's left his struggle because he's
choice<00:04:42.949> and<00:04:43.400> i<00:04:44.240> just<00:04:44.449> finished<00:04:44.840> him<00:04:44.990> off<00:04:45.110> with

00:04:45.369 --> 00:04:45.379 
choice and i just finished him off with

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:48.249 
choice and i just finished him off with
his<00:04:45.560> surf<00:04:45.860> and<00:04:46.189> that's<00:04:47.090> the<00:04:47.360> end<00:04:47.479> of<00:04:47.659> gel<00:04:47.990> tick

00:04:48.249 --> 00:04:48.259 
his surf and that's the end of gel tick

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.320 
his surf and that's the end of gel tick
so<00:04:48.770> he<00:04:48.949> sends<00:04:49.189> on<00:04:49.370> me<00:04:49.520> out<00:04:49.610> again<00:04:49.849> probably

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:50.330 
so he sends on me out again probably

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.149 
so he sends on me out again probably
going<00:04:50.750> to<00:04:50.810> go<00:04:50.960> for<00:04:51.199> a<00:04:51.229> dark-type<00:04:51.530> move<00:04:51.979> I

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:52.159 
going to go for a dark-type move I

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:54.850 
going to go for a dark-type move I
figure<00:04:52.460> I'm<00:04:52.580> going<00:04:52.789> to<00:04:52.849> stay<00:04:53.090> in<00:04:53.120> since<00:04:53.750> I<00:04:54.050> died

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
figure I'm going to stay in since I died

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.219 
figure I'm going to stay in since I died
to<00:04:55.099> stealth<00:04:55.430> rocks<00:04:55.819> if<00:04:56.090> I<00:04:56.240> switched<00:04:56.629> anyway

and frill ish is taken out and I go into
my<00:05:03.110> Gliscor<00:05:03.860> again<00:05:04.520> because<00:05:05.090> I'm<00:05:05.330> physical

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
my Gliscor again because I'm physical

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.980 
my Gliscor again because I'm physical
I'll<00:05:06.259> be<00:05:06.560> able<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:06.979> take<00:05:07.219> any<00:05:07.430> move<00:05:07.699> he<00:05:07.879> has<00:05:07.990> and

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:08.990 
I'll be able to take any move he has and

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.050 
I'll be able to take any move he has and
I've<00:05:09.080> take<00:05:09.529> it<00:05:09.740> fairly<00:05:10.099> well<00:05:10.490> and<00:05:10.759> he's<00:05:10.879> going

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
I've take it fairly well and he's going

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.390 
I've take it fairly well and he's going
to<00:05:11.120> die<00:05:11.330> to<00:05:11.389> live<00:05:11.719> for<00:05:12.110> I<00:05:12.319> should<00:05:12.770> have<00:05:12.860> roosted

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
to die to live for I should have roosted

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.010 
to die to live for I should have roosted
here<00:05:13.879> but<00:05:14.120> I<00:05:14.150> wasn't<00:05:14.509> actually<00:05:14.659> paying

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
here but I wasn't actually paying

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.860 
here but I wasn't actually paying
attention<00:05:15.139> to<00:05:15.650> the<00:05:15.770> life<00:05:15.949> orb<00:05:16.250> damage<00:05:16.639> so<00:05:17.569> he

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
attention to the life orb damage so he

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:20.469 
attention to the life orb damage so he
sends<00:05:18.110> in<00:05:18.259> bagon<00:05:18.770> I'm<00:05:19.009> thinking<00:05:19.490> outrage<00:05:20.270> is

00:05:20.469 --> 00:05:20.479 
sends in bagon I'm thinking outrage is

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:22.719 
sends in bagon I'm thinking outrage is
going<00:05:20.659> to<00:05:20.719> come<00:05:20.990> my<00:05:21.229> way<00:05:21.259> so<00:05:21.889> I'm<00:05:22.400> going<00:05:22.550> to<00:05:22.610> go

going to come my way so I'm going to go

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:25.059 
going to come my way so I'm going to go

unfortunately borough see it actually

unfortunately borough see it actually
goes<00:05:30.080> down<00:05:30.409> to<00:05:30.680> that<00:05:30.830> so<00:05:31.360> judging<00:05:32.360> by<00:05:32.389> the

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:32.509 
goes down to that so judging by the

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.209 
goes down to that so judging by the
amount<00:05:32.690> of<00:05:32.930> damage<00:05:33.289> it<00:05:33.409> did<00:05:33.560> i'm<00:05:33.740> thinking

00:05:34.209 --> 00:05:34.219 
amount of damage it did i'm thinking

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:38.050 
amount of damage it did i'm thinking
it's<00:05:34.370> probably<00:05:35.560> choice<00:05:36.560> choice<00:05:37.069> banded<00:05:37.430> so

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
it's probably choice choice banded so

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.079 
it's probably choice choice banded so
i'm<00:05:38.569> going<00:05:38.839> to<00:05:38.990> go<00:05:39.139> into<00:05:39.289> my<00:05:39.529> carvanha<00:05:40.129> and<00:05:40.580> go

00:05:41.079 --> 00:05:41.089 
i'm going to go into my carvanha and go

00:05:41.089 --> 00:05:43.570 
i'm going to go into my carvanha and go
for<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.389> protect<00:05:41.810> in<00:05:42.050> order<00:05:42.770> to<00:05:42.919> stall<00:05:43.190> out<00:05:43.370> his

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
for a protect in order to stall out his

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.809 
for a protect in order to stall out his
outrage<00:05:44.089> and<00:05:44.529> get<00:05:45.529> my<00:05:45.680> speed<00:05:46.009> boost<00:05:46.250> up<00:05:46.460> so<00:05:46.789> i

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:46.819 
outrage and get my speed boost up so i

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:48.369 
outrage and get my speed boost up so i
can<00:05:46.969> guarantee<00:05:47.300> that<00:05:47.659> i'm<00:05:48.020> going<00:05:48.139> to<00:05:48.199> be

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:48.379 
can guarantee that i'm going to be

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:51.820 
can guarantee that i'm going to be
faster<00:05:48.949> than<00:05:48.979> it<00:05:49.360> so<00:05:50.360> i<00:05:50.389> substitute<00:05:51.169> down<00:05:51.439> in

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
faster than it so i substitute down in

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.890 
faster than it so i substitute down in
order<00:05:52.129> to<00:05:52.279> stall<00:05:52.550> it<00:05:52.699> out<00:05:52.849> a<00:05:52.879> bit<00:05:53.060> more<00:05:53.419> just<00:05:53.719> in

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
order to stall it out a bit more just in

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.540 
order to stall it out a bit more just in
case<00:05:54.050> he<00:05:54.199> hurts<00:05:54.439> himself<00:05:54.650> and<00:05:55.039> he<00:05:55.099> does<00:05:55.279> hurt

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
case he hurts himself and he does hurt

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.209 
case he hurts himself and he does hurt
himself<00:05:55.729> and<00:05:56.360> I<00:05:56.479> get<00:05:56.659> another<00:05:56.900> speed<00:05:57.319> boost<00:05:57.620> so

00:05:58.209 --> 00:05:58.219 
himself and I get another speed boost so

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:01.360 
himself and I get another speed boost so
I<00:05:58.520> will<00:05:59.360> be<00:05:59.599> able<00:05:59.779> to<00:06:00.110> outspeed<00:06:00.800> it<00:06:00.949> for<00:06:01.159> sure

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:01.370 
I will be able to outspeed it for sure

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.760 
I will be able to outspeed it for sure
and<00:06:01.639> hit<00:06:01.789> it<00:06:01.909> with<00:06:02.060> a<00:06:02.089> crunch<00:06:02.479> and<00:06:03.050> so<00:06:03.289> big<00:06:03.589> on

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:06.050 
goes down and I get one more speed boost

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.439 
goes down and I get one more speed boost
as<00:06:06.289> he<00:06:06.800> goes<00:06:06.979> until<00:06:07.250> his<00:06:07.370> last<00:06:07.580> pokemon<00:06:08.000> which
