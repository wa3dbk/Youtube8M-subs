00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 bah this hold that's good can you 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.730
 even be a little bit more by 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.620
 the traffic something that it's 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:17.550
 difficult even if we have a girl 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:20.910
 extraordinary is fine but here I am 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.650
 sense like a lot of women and that's to 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.330
 to say that in the morning when I woke up I 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.220
 always feel like not seeing this 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.160
 thing and then not know what to 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.570
 put for a very long time me 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.949
 always said that I was the 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.809
 Parisian type 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.370
 I do not want the impression that 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.510
 Parisian meant something 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.809
 that's why I made a book 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.489
 with sophie gachet duel to try to 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.620
 to know what a Parisian woman was 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:46.860
 it really is different from 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.329
 other women but yes in fact I'm 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.300
 I'm seen buying clothes 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.340
 it's a little bit the cupboard 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.629
 of a crazy madwoman because I 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.850
 tendency to always buy the same 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.850
 thing for example navy blue sweater 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.270
 white shirts from mariniÃ¨res 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.640
 never know exactly the same 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:07.860
 but at the same time its meaning like that a 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.869
 kind of two sons 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.130
 it's a bit like belmont sheets 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.860
 Babel fashion has either b bell and you are here 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.760
 it's done 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.590
 today I am asked what is my 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.110
 role in the house roger vivier 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.850
 I mainly take care of the 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.770
 decoration of all the shops in 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.200
 the world to buy furniture since 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.920
 it will be vintage furniture so 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.380
 different each time 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.060
 always of communication even 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.680
 always what is vivacious what he 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.780
 is not good I can have the cut 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.780
 like we laugh a super natural thing 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.760
 with her from a long story huh 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.700
 when I became a model 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.369
 next day my agency sent me to see 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.720
 odile sarron who was the very person 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.760
 important who chose the 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.680
 mannequins for is there and who 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.229
 get involved on the spot for a session 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:00.090
 photos of the week after and so 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.509
 I had this first photo shoot 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:06.210
 with oliviero toscani who said with 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.660
 his strong italian accent star is born 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.709
 which means in Italian that really 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:12.990
 I was not very developed 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.720
 there was a little bit of irony in his 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.930
 voice and so I worked 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.510
 immediately for her and that was 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:24.680
 really the first magazine for which 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:27.930
 I took pictures then there was 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.900
 pictures of me as a model 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:33.600
 but then pregnant after with my 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.100
 children my first daughter my second 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.070
 girl 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.720
 that's the story of my life the she if I 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:42.630
 lose my family albums just 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:45.570
 to go for old albums 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:49.680
 so it's to tell you that my life 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:52.050
 personal and the newspaper all that is 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.110
 bound I have a lot of friends 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:58.260
 within writing so at a real 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.680
 confidence and a real cheerfulness already then 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.220
 know that if you take a picture 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:07.290
 now have made my time no 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:09.840
 now it's like that I 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.960
 the impression that women who have a 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.170
 certain age and who read it since 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.720
 always have a kind of complicity of 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.210
 complicity in common because 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.810
 she always keeps a little bit of 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:27.390
 youth of frivolity but who 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.730
 does not prevent the depth and it is this 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.480
 paradox that amuses me that I like it is at 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.480
 l1
