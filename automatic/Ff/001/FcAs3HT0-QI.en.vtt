00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:20.829
 we find the presence of a small part of production and a iphone com 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:23.499
 mechanically also I d 

00:00:23.499 --> 00:00:26.499
 we are details of particular series 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.019
 in the first case 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:32.019
 we see curaro scale 200 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.590
 with dial 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.530
 a4 written 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.140
 this makes it very special because this quadrant a4 written 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.130
 it was produced not only for a year 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.550
 besides the peculiarity of the chateau that appears on different models 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.680
 of those years that is the early 90s 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.750
 let's see. the peculiarity of this quadrant 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.030
 sms to 200 of the united kingdom 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.710
 It is very difficult to send for the union 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.380
 in the second case 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.640
 instead we present one quite rare this today because apart 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.719
 who has a stock fund so part 3 has never been worn 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.020
 that the dials the counters 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.230
 they are browned so I don't love anymore 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.350
 the initial feature but for the perfect travel expenses of paint 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.280
 of those years 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.950
 I meant dead to become brown we look even if turned upside down 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.550
 particular that 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.550
 we carry on for the early 90s 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.090
 which makes this watch unique precisely the fact that it has an os so it is 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.980
 a gift from a stock fund oh my e-mail 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.710
 used so far 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.620
 therefore he will say the web of life in this sense precisely because he is a man and 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.530
 we can see very complete 

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:12.980
 in the third case, however, we always dare to be particular but less so in the first two 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:19.329
 we also have a serial where it was produced only for a year and a state 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.150
 not between them two traditional between movement as kamikaze nite and that 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.509
 current that is mechanical rolex 

00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:31.999
 therefore particular to the attachment of the bracelet 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:36.499
 which is different than those years before so we have an attack of 

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:39.499
 abbatial type star 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:45.559
 and the peculiarity is quadrant also that it is no longer a tritium but rather a 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:48.559
 quadrant as the latter is adopted 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.259
 dayton in production then on 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:54.039
 a dial 

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:57.039
 with superluminova 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:03.660
 as we repeat the traditional way then produced only for a year in '99 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.660
 at the turn of 99 2000 

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:10.699
 queen - rende - atdhe 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.439
 more particular notes 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:15.349
 compared to the other 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:18.349
 the most common misery 

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.879
 sign in 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:34.029
 it goes
