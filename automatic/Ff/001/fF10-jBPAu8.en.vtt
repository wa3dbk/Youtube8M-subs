00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.220
 the anti-hero par excellence of nintendo 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.270
 they return game and war I paraguay although 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.980
 I can be deceived 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.530
 we are not facing a new game of the 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.570
 saga war web so discover with 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.720
 what is this really about? 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.400
 new user title 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.800
 the first thing we have to make clear 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.260
 is that we are not facing a full future 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.060
 of micro five-second games game 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.220
 and war I have 16 games of 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.230
 being variable size and complexity being 12 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.110
 of them for a player and 4 for the 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.850
 all multiplayer of course 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.950
 they play exclusively with the 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.200
 wii command without exception 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.430
 the variety of games is somewhat scarce and 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.850
 the fun and quality of them 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.860
 It also varies a lot between one and the other 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.720
 we found elaborate games like arrow 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.310
 or taxi that are not bad but that once 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.440
 we have overcome their different levels 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.930
 They do not offer much more than trying 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.970
 improve our score 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.010
 there are some pretty original games 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.990
 as a camera where we will have to use the 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.030
 command as a photo camera to capture 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.909
 the characters that will appear in the 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.039
 next cover of the newspaper 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.170
 among the funniest is 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.819
 gamer that mixes the classic succession of 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.880
 micro warioware games with the 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:39.619
 vigilance of our mother nine bolt 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.329
 plays hidden during the night without 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.609
 permission from his mother and we will have 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.200
 that help him we play the micro games in 

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:47.270
 the command and at the same time we should 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.579
 stay tuned to television for 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.960
 prevent us from discovering the tension is 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.240
 maximum in the last levels 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.400
 the multiplayer mode has four 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.080
 games a really scarce number for 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.940
 a way that should have a lot more 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.550
 strength by luck are quite 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.350
 funny 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.340
 the first game invites a whole classic 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.039
 of pictionary board games 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.750
 meanwhile on island we launched front to 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.519
 different floating platforms for 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.840
 get points and nothing was decided 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:17.819
 until the last move 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.129
 the classic game of the thief and 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.959
 policemen reinvents themselves in 'fruit where 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.090
 who plays with the wii command must 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:25.920
 steal the fruit from the stage without the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.210
 rest of the players discover their 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.730
 identity 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.500
 finally on disk we will have to continue 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.640
 the rhythm of the music to repeat them 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.910
 with phases that mark our 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.890
 opponent and overcome his score 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.260
 the title has a version of the 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.880
 drawing game adapted to my bears in 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.620
 this mode will be other players who 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.870
 suggest words and we will have 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.700
 we can draw them we can share 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.650
 drawings in my bears propose our 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:52.710
 own words and see the designs that 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.420
 other users do to encourage the 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.370
 region skill the title has 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.080
 many collectable objects with challenges 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.670
 of score to be exceeded and most 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.550
 of the games have different 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.350
 levels or scenarios but all this does not 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.210
 solve that we can finish the title in 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.100
 little more than one afternoon and that ends 

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:11.160
 being repetitive a few days after 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.930
 game and although the multiplayer mode yes 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.700
 offers fun times in company 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.380
 after a couple of weekends the 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.180
 Novelty will have passed and we will decant 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.740
 for other multiplayer titles more 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.540
 entertained 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.430
 as you will have verified throughout the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.440
 game and war analysis I have small 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.990
 different quality games that end 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.150
 forming a repetitive title with little 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.890
 attractive and is that unlike what 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.080
 what happens in the saga war were in this 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.940
 occasion several eggs do not make a title 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.940
 complete that is worth buying
