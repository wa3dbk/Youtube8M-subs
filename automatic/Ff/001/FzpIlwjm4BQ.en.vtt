00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:06.620
 for everyone in our competition in 

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:10.340
 this smart most learn to join two 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:14.720
 tissues here I already prepare prepared 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:18.260
 two samples and we managed to need that goes 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:22.250
 needle a needle to sew the wool that 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:25.160
 is a bit like the end twisted and 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:28.279
 good first to teach look at the 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.260
 stretch the wool between each point we have 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.260
 get way like some stairs 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.430
 I managed to put the two points 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:44.480
 like stairs a few steps and the 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.480
 another side too 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.560
 well I'm going to approach a little bit the 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.560
 camera so you can see better 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.940
 and well what we are going to do first is 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:08.909
 go through the first point the needle 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.909
 on this side and on this side too 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.630
 we do that to unite the two sides and 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.530
 now let's start sewing I taught you 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.990
 and to the stairs and steps and what 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.330
 what we're going to do first is pass the 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.340
 looking needle 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.340
 the first step between the points 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.380
 let's move the needle 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:39.950
 and let's go back to look 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:43.180
 the first one is colon 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.180
 of the protected 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.840
 between points 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.649
 let's move on 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.649
 the needle 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.549
 and go back to look for another way 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.549
 the next climber 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.840
 again 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.510
 on the other hand 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.580
 being always left a little bit of 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:22.480
 space between the two tissues so that 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:25.349
 can allow us better management of 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.349
 of the tissue 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.100
 on the other side we also look for the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.100
 next step 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.800
 well here I am finishing sewing the 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:21.350
 two sides and even if I did it with the 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:26.290
 Red wool 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.290
 you are not going to ride anything of the culture 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.510
 we will arrive seeing the nothing 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.159
 both sides are left 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:52.510
 the height there is no space between 

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:56.790
 the two points and good to the other side is 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:04:00.489
 how is the posture like that 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.790
 pretty ugly the truth but good what 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:07.620
 important that on the other side we have 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.510
 managed to join the two sides 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.209
 without a trace 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.159
 and I hope you liked it today and 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:16.380
 I hope to see you soon my channel you know 

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:20.329
