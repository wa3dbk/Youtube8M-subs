welcome to how to RC I have taken the
liberty<00:00:10.220> of<00:00:11.650> modifying<00:00:12.650> the<00:00:13.610> Polaris<00:00:15.400> after

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
liberty of modifying the Polaris after

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.550 
liberty of modifying the Polaris after
having<00:00:16.760> built<00:00:17.030> two<00:00:17.630> of<00:00:17.780> them

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
having built two of them

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.450 
having built two of them
for<00:00:20.130> my<00:00:20.310> purposes<00:00:21.830> this<00:00:22.830> should<00:00:23.099> be<00:00:23.250> better

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
for my purposes this should be better

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.710 
for my purposes this should be better
we'll<00:00:24.300> see<00:00:24.750> if<00:00:24.779> it<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.939> here's<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.119> basic<00:00:27.240> wing

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
we'll see if it it here's the basic wing

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:38.680 
we'll see if it it here's the basic wing
shape<00:00:29.810> just<00:00:30.810> started<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.289> cut<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.560> out<00:00:31.680> and

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.369 

here's<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.780> stock<00:00:40.260> wing<00:00:41.510> that's<00:00:42.510> already<00:00:42.989> cut

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
here's a stock wing that's already cut

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:51.049 
here's a stock wing that's already cut
out<00:00:46.280> to<00:00:47.280> give<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.579> a<00:00:47.610> comparison<00:00:49.670> ok<00:00:50.670> so<00:00:50.730> the

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
out to give you a comparison ok so the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.250 
out to give you a comparison ok so the
way<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.269> the<00:00:51.540> same<00:00:51.750> length<00:00:52.760> fore<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:53.850> aft<00:00:54.260> but

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
way is the same length fore and aft but

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.869 
way is the same length fore and aft but
it's<00:00:55.409> much<00:00:55.589> wider<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:56.159> a<00:00:56.250> little<00:00:56.489> different

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
it's much wider in a little different

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.039 
it's much wider in a little different
shape<00:00:57.350> now<00:00:58.350> move<00:00:58.619> the<00:00:58.650> ailerons<00:00:59.280> out<00:01:00.019> quite<00:01:01.019> a

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:01.049 
shape now move the ailerons out quite a

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:09.160 
shape now move the ailerons out quite a
bit<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:02.570> I<00:01:04.880> hope<00:01:05.880> this<00:01:06.090> little<00:01:06.659> fly<00:01:07.229> slower

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
bit and I hope this little fly slower

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.780 
bit and I hope this little fly slower
I'm<00:01:10.170> going<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.830> put<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:12.890> client<00:01:13.890> Fogelman<00:01:14.460> step

I'm going to have to get a no a sheet
you<00:01:32.130> cut<00:01:32.399> as<00:01:32.579> I<00:01:32.700> can't<00:01:33.030> get<00:01:33.270> everything<00:01:33.929> out<00:01:34.049> of

00:01:34.099 --> 00:01:34.109 
you cut as I can't get everything out of

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:37.809 
you cut as I can't get everything out of
this<00:01:34.380> one<00:01:34.679> sheet<00:01:35.039> I<00:01:35.420> stretch<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.749> fuselage

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
this one sheet I stretch the fuselage

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:43.880 
this one sheet I stretch the fuselage
let<00:01:38.819> me<00:01:38.909> see

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.880 

and<00:01:44.890> stretch<00:01:45.189> the<00:01:45.429> fuselage<00:01:46.439> 2<00:01:47.439> inches

and stretch the fuselage 2 inches

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.819 
and stretch the fuselage 2 inches
because<00:01:48.159> I<00:01:48.340> had<00:01:48.609> so<00:01:48.789> much<00:01:48.850> trouble<00:01:49.829> getting

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 
because I had so much trouble getting

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:54.209 
because I had so much trouble getting
the<00:01:51.189> center<00:01:51.579> of<00:01:51.700> gravity<00:01:52.270> correct<00:01:52.719> on<00:01:53.069> the<00:01:54.069> one

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:54.219 
the center of gravity correct on the one

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:56.959 
the center of gravity correct on the one
I'm<00:01:54.369> flying<00:01:54.729> now<00:01:55.090> so<00:01:55.750> here's<00:01:56.020> a<00:01:56.079> stock

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
I'm flying now so here's a stock

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.990 
I'm flying now so here's a stock
fuselage<00:01:57.969> side<00:01:58.359> and<00:01:59.250> I've<00:02:00.250> stretched<00:02:00.609> it<00:02:00.819> two

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
fuselage side and I've stretched it two

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.730 
fuselage side and I've stretched it two
inches<00:02:01.209> so<00:02:01.509> I<00:02:01.569> get<00:02:01.780> my<00:02:01.929> battery<00:02:02.349> that<00:02:02.500> much

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
inches so I get my battery that much

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:15.960 
inches so I get my battery that much
further<00:02:03.069> forward

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.510 

a<00:02:16.090> big<00:02:16.660> tail

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:29.530 

talk

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.289 

here's<00:02:30.540> my<00:02:30.780> tail<00:02:31.280> on<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.340> centerpiece<00:02:33.000> of<00:02:33.030> the

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
here's my tail on the centerpiece of the

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.910 
here's my tail on the centerpiece of the
tail<00:02:33.569> and<00:02:33.900> I've<00:02:34.109> made<00:02:34.290> it<00:02:34.409> out<00:02:34.560> of<00:02:34.650> nine

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
tail and I've made it out of nine

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.009 
tail and I've made it out of nine
millimeter<00:02:35.519> depron<00:02:36.260> because<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.439> gives<00:02:37.709> the

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
millimeter depron because it gives the

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.789 
millimeter depron because it gives the
wire<00:02:40.019> chase<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.950> goes<00:02:41.129> down<00:02:41.400> through<00:02:41.730> here

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
wire chase that goes down through here

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.500 
wire chase that goes down through here
makes<00:02:43.799> three<00:02:44.189> millimeters<00:02:44.700> wider<00:02:44.969> that's<00:02:45.299> why

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
makes three millimeters wider that's why

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.050 
makes three millimeters wider that's why
make<00:02:46.019> the<00:02:46.230> tail<00:02:46.439> stronger<00:02:47.069> this<00:02:47.969> is<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.299> stock

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
make the tail stronger this is the stock

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.360 
make the tail stronger this is the stock
tail<00:02:51.060> as<00:02:51.359> you<00:02:51.750> can<00:02:51.900> see<00:02:52.109> I've<00:02:52.290> made<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.650> half<00:02:53.189> an

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
tail as you can see I've made it half an

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.330 
tail as you can see I've made it half an
inch<00:02:53.549> taller<00:02:54.319> which<00:02:55.319> will<00:02:55.500> allow<00:02:55.620> me<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.069> swing

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
inch taller which will allow me to swing

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.129 
inch taller which will allow me to swing
an<00:02:56.459> eight<00:02:56.700> inch<00:02:56.939> profit<00:02:57.569> a<00:02:57.599> little<00:02:57.840> slower

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
an eight inch profit a little slower

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:01.610 
an eight inch profit a little slower
motor<00:02:58.500> than<00:02:59.069> the<00:02:59.099> park<00:02:59.760> jet<00:03:00.030> motors<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:01.319> are

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
motor than the park jet motors that are

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.729 
motor than the park jet motors that are
being<00:03:01.919> running<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.459> stock<00:03:04.010> so<00:03:05.010> for<00:03:05.250> now

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
being running the stock so for now

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:13.010 
being running the stock so for now
that's<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:09.470> more<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.620> come<00:03:10.799> later
