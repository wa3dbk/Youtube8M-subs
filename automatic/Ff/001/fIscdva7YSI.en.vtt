something useful it also will save you a

something useful it also will save you a
little<00:04:10.810> bit<00:04:11.020> of<00:04:11.410> money<00:04:11.740> too<00:04:12.330> if<00:04:13.330> we<00:04:13.540> hover<00:04:13.720> over

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
little bit of money too if we hover over

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.020 
little bit of money too if we hover over
that<00:04:14.200> again<00:04:14.320> we<00:04:14.980> can<00:04:15.190> see<00:04:15.400> we've<00:04:15.550> got<00:04:15.730> image

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
that again we can see we've got image

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.450 
that again we can see we've got image

clip image clip works in a couple of

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:20.520 
clip image clip works in a couple of
ways<00:04:18.730> we<00:04:19.210> can<00:04:19.390> tap<00:04:19.660> through<00:04:19.870> on<00:04:19.960> it<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:20.230> we<00:04:20.320> can

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
ways we can tap through on it and we can

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.039 
ways we can tap through on it and we can
select<00:04:21.100> an<00:04:21.489> element

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
select an element

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.320 
select an element
for<00:04:22.199> example<00:04:22.680> we've<00:04:23.280> got<00:04:23.490> emails<00:04:23.849> selected

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
for example we've got emails selected

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.330 
for example we've got emails selected
there<00:04:24.479> we<00:04:24.599> can<00:04:24.780> change<00:04:25.139> that<00:04:25.440> into<00:04:25.650> a<00:04:25.860> round

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
there we can change that into a round

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.399 
there we can change that into a round
selection<00:04:27.060> we<00:04:27.240> can<00:04:27.270> change<00:04:27.960> out<00:04:28.169> into<00:04:28.319> a

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:28.409 
selection we can change out into a

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:29.869 
selection we can change out into a
square<00:04:28.650> selection<00:04:29.099> we<00:04:29.190> have<00:04:29.220> freehand

00:04:29.869 --> 00:04:29.879 
square selection we have freehand

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.820 
square selection we have freehand
selection<00:04:30.030> selected<00:04:30.840> before<00:04:31.110> or<00:04:31.440> we<00:04:31.680> can

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
selection selected before or we can

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.860 
selection selected before or we can
select<00:04:32.060> magnetically<00:04:33.060> so<00:04:33.270> it<00:04:33.330> will<00:04:33.479> actually

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
select magnetically so it will actually

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.529 
select magnetically so it will actually
just<00:04:34.580> intelligently<00:04:35.580> choose<00:04:35.970> what<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.389> select

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:36.539 
just intelligently choose what to select

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:38.779 
just intelligently choose what to select
and<00:04:36.840> that's<00:04:36.960> exactly<00:04:37.319> what<00:04:37.710> we<00:04:37.830> want<00:04:38.039> to<00:04:38.129> do<00:04:38.250> so

00:04:38.779 --> 00:04:38.789 
and that's exactly what we want to do so

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:40.939 
and that's exactly what we want to do so
you<00:04:38.970> want<00:04:39.060> to<00:04:39.210> then<00:04:39.360> save<00:04:39.960> that<00:04:40.409> little<00:04:40.620> icon

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
you want to then save that little icon

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:48.559 
you want to then save that little icon
into<00:04:41.460> a<00:04:42.180> new<00:04:43.020> scrapbook<00:04:44.030> save<00:04:45.080> save<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:47.569> we've

here<00:05:12.870> we<00:05:13.020> want<00:05:13.409> to<00:05:13.500> grab<00:05:13.830> that<00:05:14.180> select<00:05:15.469> image

00:05:16.459 --> 00:05:16.469 
here we want to grab that select image

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:20.959 
here we want to grab that select image
clip<00:05:17.719> grab<00:05:18.719> the<00:05:19.050> Sun<00:05:19.430> that's<00:05:20.430> a<00:05:20.639> little<00:05:20.849> bit

00:05:20.959 --> 00:05:20.969 
clip grab the Sun that's a little bit

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:22.909 
clip grab the Sun that's a little bit
messy<00:05:21.270> let's<00:05:21.449> make<00:05:21.629> it<00:05:21.659> a<00:05:21.870> circle<00:05:22.319> much<00:05:22.650> much

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
messy let's make it a circle much much

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:25.909 
messy let's make it a circle much much
nicer<00:05:22.949> we<00:05:23.819> can<00:05:24.000> then<00:05:24.120> long<00:05:24.360> press<00:05:24.389> that<00:05:24.919> throw

00:05:25.909 --> 00:05:25.919 
nicer we can then long press that throw

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:30.439 
nicer we can then long press that throw
it<00:05:26.069> into<00:05:26.279> a<00:05:26.699> text<00:05:27.419> message<00:05:27.779> and<00:05:29.120> that<00:05:30.120> is<00:05:30.270> going

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:30.449 
it into a text message and that is going

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.019 
it into a text message and that is going
to<00:05:30.509> convert<00:05:30.840> it<00:05:31.020> to<00:05:31.050> an<00:05:31.289> MMS<00:05:31.889> with<00:05:32.610> a<00:05:32.639> nice

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
to convert it to an MMS with a nice

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:35.269 
to convert it to an MMS with a nice
little<00:05:33.360> Sun<00:05:33.960> in<00:05:33.990> it<00:05:34.229> which<00:05:34.380> is<00:05:34.650> brilliant

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279 
little Sun in it which is brilliant

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.420 
little Sun in it which is brilliant
so<00:05:35.639> that's<00:05:36.060> probably<00:05:36.479> not<00:05:36.659> such<00:05:37.199> a<00:05:37.229> useful<00:05:37.889> use

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
so that's probably not such a useful use

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.700 
so that's probably not such a useful use
of<00:05:38.639> image<00:05:39.330> clip<00:05:39.569> unless<00:05:39.960> you<00:05:40.110> send<00:05:40.319> a<00:05:40.440> lot<00:05:40.590> of

of image clip unless you send a lot of

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.140 
of image clip unless you send a lot of

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:55.440 
it is the simplest the most obvious and

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.950 
it is the simplest the most obvious and
it<00:05:55.620> is<00:05:55.770> screen<00:05:56.430> right<00:05:56.729> that<00:05:57.300> is<00:05:57.509> what<00:05:57.810> you're
