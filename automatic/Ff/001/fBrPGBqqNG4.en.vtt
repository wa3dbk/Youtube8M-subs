00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:08.400
 since this new test appeared 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.920
 I got to learn a little something about 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.660
 we Russians do not need powers to 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.699
 to be a family and we will not allow 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.720
 that powers separate us agrees 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.090
 with me 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.740
 she's right, I do not want to end 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.609
 Losing my brothers, me too. 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.730
 give up 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.439
 Alex made a speech yesterday and the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.439
 part that I remember was very touching 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.969
 I also give up proud of you for 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.120
 have united 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.239
 Good, I guess I'm going to a place. 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.960
 Where do I want to stay when I have not 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:47.960
 more powers 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:57.469
 we ended up taking 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:04.229
 dude, I hate this job all 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.549
 days I see the spell competition 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:12.930
 destroy families 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:15.920
 I'll even let you stay with 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.920
 your powers 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:26.010
 You 're disrespecting the rules. 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.830
 I do not respect the rules, it's all 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:31.530
 right and let it go 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:41.580
 Sorry if this comes up you can 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:44.330
 forget I had it here look sorry 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:49.380
 even if you put yourself in this mess 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.300
 It has nothing to do with mega and I claim 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:02:02.580
 I do not play with you. 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:06.810
 I work and my friend my friend ever 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.220
 could figure out how to do so 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.580
 What do you think of us taking things off 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.580
 boxes 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:19.080
 so we let the max do this 

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:22.910
 I'm not in the mood for free protest 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.910
 do not think and mess up this car pile 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:38.910
 well there is only the refrigerator is 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:41.880
 working 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:45.690
 I know you and I see the number of 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.840
 Hotel wand here on my screen 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.890
 press the single horse key which 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.890
 always does 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.449
