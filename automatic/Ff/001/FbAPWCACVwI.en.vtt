00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.940
 Hi guys, I'm going to teach chips today. 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.000
 sweet potato is a very simple and 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:12.389
 tasty good, we 'll start 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.400
 cutting the sweet potato is I like with 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.279
 peeling then is an old tactic but case 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.949
 do not like just take the first trick 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.470
 of this recipe is you cut the slice well 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.269
 thin 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.460
 I'm going to accelerate a little because it does not have 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.789
 need you to look all 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.789
 process 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.469
 this amount I'm doing are 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.469
 for three people 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.750
 I used a potato and a half 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.980
 As you can see, it's really thin. 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:01.559
 the slice is less than half of the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:01:05.640
 the thickness of my finger the second secret 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:09.659
 of revenue is the arrangement of these slices 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.200
 in the tray I use a one time is one 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:16.530
 Different tray but it's a teikon spray 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.600
 of butter and its companion states 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.869
 united but in case you do not have just use 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:25.259
 paper towel and light margarine as well 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.869
 little and spread by time is fine 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.740
 the trick is the following all the slices 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:35.600
 have to be in contact with the flag 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.159
 can not have any superimposed on the other 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:46.890
 I found a little video to not stay 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:50.520
 monotonous extreme that fits well is 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.380
 must you give 2 uses two time only 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.130
 wait for the first round to be ready 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.130
 to place the 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.850
 measured as well as rear 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.880
 plus the weight watchers here in Brazil 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:06.550
 he sells and some stores like 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:12.330
 multicoisas she also sells this 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.330
 6 half tablespoon marker 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.280
 I'm using half a tablespoon of soup. 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.280
 run because I'm going to give one more 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.740
 stressed over butter but case 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.170
 You do not go to use the spray you can 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:29.640
 put one a tablespoon of olive oil 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.640
 and you will see, in a moment, placing 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.570
 the olive oil I 'm using the extra rooster 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.570
 virgin 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.950
 I'm putting a little salt on it. 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.500
 and a little powdered pepper 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.860
 but this will suit your liking if you do not 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:17.920
 like if you prefer to put without salt 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:19.600
 it will only oil the same mixture 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.660
 I'm using an appropriate brush 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:27.670
 to the kitchen and brush in each of the 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:30.600
 slices is very little even just for 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:30.600
 give a special touch 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:42.030
 After that, as I said I will. 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:44.890
 put a stress on that butter 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.830
 last trick gives this recipe is you already 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.380
 put the potatoes in a preheated fire 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.530
 You're that about 150 degrees. 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:57.090
 not too hot places the tray 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:00.370
 after the ten twelve minutes you take 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.709
 turn the potatoes saw all the slices and 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.590
 put on the fire a little warmer for 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:07.090
 around 200 degrees 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.950
 after that it 's five more minutes 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.510
 keep an eye on why else the band 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:16.019
 burn very fast since it is 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.019
 very thin and then just take and appetite
