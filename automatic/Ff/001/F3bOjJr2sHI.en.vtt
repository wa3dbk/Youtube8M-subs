00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello everybody i 'm here that welcome you 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:06.690
 weekly summary of blizzard news and 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.859
 starting with gears of the storm as 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.710
 I did not say anything about him in the week. 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.269
 past on May 20, there was a 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.519
 question and answer session with 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.529
 developers of the game and in the session he 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.060
 reveal some things about the new pet 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.609
 but the cool thing is that they talk about 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.439
 a new hero who is a little that is 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.080
 A little crazy in sigma is 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.150
 very political in and said he will 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.529
 act as a specialist and differential 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.140
 despite his being a champion 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.120
 physically weak he has ability to 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.590
 put several eggs hidden by the 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.050
 map and every time he dies and is reborn 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.510
 of one of these eggs because it makes 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.010
 practically deadly and very irritating to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.410
 the enemies why you think you 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.510
 killed google leona has a 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.390
 in front of him he'll talk 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.039
 Skills him the names in English 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.440
 but you can understand what is one of them is 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.870
 the fish that if I remember correctly was 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.899
 produced with bahia short time by fish 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.550
 be the echo that is a puffer that will 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:04.140
 getting and exploding and Adam in frame pi 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.670
 quadrupled in structures, what makes 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.189
 him a great champion to do 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.920
 backdoor or speed pole when you want 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.450
 has also called his football with 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.220
 the security bubble that basically 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.360
 put a little bit inside a bubble 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.340
 of security 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.990
 it also has slime leaving the enemy o 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.060
 enemy hit slow 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.310
 I have march of the moon locks that I can 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.020
 be translated as the march of blocks 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.880
 that it involves a ridiculous amount 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.280
 de roux that attack all enemies that 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.320
 are close by also have the octagonal and 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.000
 who plays an enemy people holding him 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.240
 in the place to your left was also 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.520
 announced that the murina is given 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.670
 which is practically the little pig inside 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.079
 an armor of starcraft 2 soldiers 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.270
 so I recorded this video they 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.070
 also showed a video of the new hero 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.630
 or a little if you want to watch it 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.310
 just take a look at the video description 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.810
 I did not put it here because it got less 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.210
 calm with copyright then 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.799
 better or know direct watch there and still 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.710
 on the question and answer session 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.560
 said that ide has undergone a redesign 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.350
 more than half of the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.600
 heroes will have their skills 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.300
 many changes have taken place. 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.209
 in the game interface now it will have 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.400
 support for cans at some point they 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.590
 are working in another 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.659
 there are other maps and also the future 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.329
 make thematic maps of each 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:21.860
 one of the blizzard franchises and friends 

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:24.290
 they have a warning for the privileged 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.129
 who have access to the heroes of 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.870
 the storm 

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:29.930
 from now on people who stay 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.629
 giving rezc ti is becoming toxic from 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.819
 respect the colleges will be banned 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.099
 of the game and what strikes me is that 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.870
 people who have access to the river technician 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:40.819
 ave storm that honestly so 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.609
 A lot of people wanted to have me 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:46.489
 do not have access and the people have the morning 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:47.810
 of being toxic and an idiot I do not 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:49.909
 I agree with this, it's no joke, it 's 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.209
 shame these people and who knows about 

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:53.750
 more space for who wants to play 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.510
 right 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.519
 like me and moving on to the 23rd 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.319
 that you liked the Gulf of 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.689
 birthday that for those who do not remember gave 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.700
 100% bonus on the chances of finding and have 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.409
 legendary good deal that the breeze that 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.450
 realized that we liked this 

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.220
 the new drug rate of legendary 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.260
 decided to make it permanent then 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.909
 now the buffet will end but they 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.220
 modified the drop rates of 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:18.829
 legendary forever to stay the same 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.269
 was during the birthday banquet and 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.400
 still within the celebrations of 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:24.470
 devil's birthday three inhabitants 

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.959
 made available in the game guide the 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.000
 Devil's story that the virtual book 53 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.190
 pages that tells the story of seven 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.620
 students by day 2 by the expansion 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:34.760
 stop orders arriving on the 23rd still 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.709
 has no expansion 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.510
 michael jackson's and it's interesting 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.949
 Because she studies, it reminds us of 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.480
 history of other games since 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:43.669
 people's problems, it's been a while 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.530
 which was then played not everything is too much 

00:03:43.669 --> 00:03:47.569
 fresh in memory but it is important to note 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.519
 that what is in this story of the devil 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:51.680
 that they actually provided the 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.090
 happened in the games then by 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.799
 Example I'm reading the book to order 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.599
 tell the story of who has nothing 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.220
 in this book in this story that 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:59.030
 they made available then if you want 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.010
 to know 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.930
 besides what happened inside the game 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.720
 you're still going to get behind other 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.269
 sources and moving on to the other was 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.430
 mma champion vossa pictures 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:13.489
 possible interface enhancements for 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.769
 expansion of the software between them 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.419
 now the shortcuts are not going to be all 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.159
 played on the same list, these were 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.109
 separated by categories 

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:23.240
 now the dungeon marketing has been showing 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.580
 details of each of the separate heads 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.930
 for each player role to help 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.630
 especially the new 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.820
 players and the r 11 will now be able to be 

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.100
 enabled and disabled in you 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.600
 You need to quit the game and try 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.490
 improve queuing time 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.310

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.740

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:44.870
 of faction for free the test group goes 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.660
 be the server particles and those 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.610
 senators want to switch from the horde to the

 covenant of grace and although I do not 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.470
 I know no wave person that 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.509
 change for the alliance or for free on 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.669
 practice even if they paid for them 

00:04:56.509 --> 00:05:00.530
 they would want to change the alliance but what 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:03.139

 approximately one week 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:09.410
 approximately because according to them it is a 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.110
 test and holds with thing flowing term 

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.120
 can be extended or anticipated 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.490
