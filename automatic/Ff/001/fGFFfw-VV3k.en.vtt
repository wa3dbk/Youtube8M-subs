when<00:00:07.140> I<00:00:07.170> formed<00:00:07.710> the<00:00:07.830> antelope<00:00:08.309> I<00:00:08.700> went<00:00:09.360> back

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
when I formed the antelope I went back

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.110 
when I formed the antelope I went back
to<00:00:09.719> my<00:00:09.870> roots<00:00:10.170> so<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.590> speak<00:00:10.920> and<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.250> took<00:00:11.880> up

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
to my roots so to speak and I took up

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.230 
to my roots so to speak and I took up
the<00:00:12.389> question<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.080> clocking<00:00:13.620> again<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.969> year

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
the question of clocking again so year

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.939 
the question of clocking again so year
is<00:00:15.360> 2005<00:00:16.170> and<00:00:17.300> we're<00:00:18.300> going<00:00:18.630> back<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:19.410> know<00:00:19.560> we

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
is 2005 and we're going back you know we

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.240 
is 2005 and we're going back you know we
have<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> new<00:00:20.460> animal<00:00:20.880> and<00:00:21.289> times<00:00:22.289> of<00:00:22.529> also

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
have a new animal and times of also

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.939 
have a new animal and times of also
progressed<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.170> technology<00:00:25.170> progress<00:00:25.439> the

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
progressed and technology progress the

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.269 
progressed and technology progress the
chips<00:00:26.330> the<00:00:27.330> ideas<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:28.019> was<00:00:28.470> looking<00:00:28.830> for<00:00:29.099> ways

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
chips the ideas I was looking for ways

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.400 
chips the ideas I was looking for ways
to<00:00:29.340> improve<00:00:29.699> what<00:00:30.179> I've<00:00:30.300> done<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.230> art

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
to improve what I've done with the art

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.970 
to improve what I've done with the art
sink<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.130> that's<00:00:32.940> where<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.649> realized<00:00:34.649> I<00:00:34.860> would

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
sink and that's where I realized I would

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.680 
sink and that's where I realized I would
have<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.399> a<00:00:35.640> more<00:00:35.820> stable<00:00:36.030> time<00:00:36.420> base

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
have to go to a more stable time base

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.780 
have to go to a more stable time base
and<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.079> introduced<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.860> idea<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.309> open

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
and I introduced the idea of open

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.560 
and I introduced the idea of open
controlled<00:00:39.860> crystal<00:00:40.860> oscillator<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:42.360> by

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
controlled crystal oscillator so by

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.389 
controlled crystal oscillator so by
putting<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.079> crystal<00:00:43.559> oscillator<00:00:44.070> which<00:00:44.370> is

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
putting the crystal oscillator which is

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.700 
putting the crystal oscillator which is
the<00:00:44.670> heartbeat<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.480> clock<00:00:45.750> inside<00:00:46.260> an

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
the heartbeat of the clock inside an

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.740 
the heartbeat of the clock inside an
enclosure<00:00:49.640> and<00:00:50.640> keeping<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.210> temperature

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
enclosure and keeping the temperature

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.660 
enclosure and keeping the temperature
constant<00:00:52.100> keeping<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> temperature

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
constant keeping the temperature

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.250 
constant keeping the temperature
constant<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:54.239> important<00:00:54.690> because<00:00:54.809> the

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
constant is important because the

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.709 
constant is important because the
crystal<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.860> an<00:00:56.160> analog<00:00:56.550> component<00:00:57.239> that

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
crystal is an analog component that

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.619 
crystal is an analog component that
vibrates<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.680> oscillates<00:00:59.190> so<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.090> responds

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
vibrates the oscillates so it responds

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.590 
vibrates the oscillates so it responds
to<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.370> environment<00:01:02.370> by<00:01:03.090> keeping<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
to the environment by keeping the

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.939 
to the environment by keeping the
temperature<00:01:04.049> constant<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.739> can

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
temperature constant you can

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.920 
temperature constant you can
considerably<00:01:05.700> improve<00:01:06.090> its<00:01:06.270> stability<00:01:06.510> and

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
considerably improve its stability and

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.490 
considerably improve its stability and
jitter<00:01:07.500> performance<00:01:07.970> so<00:01:08.970> that's<00:01:09.470> when<00:01:10.470> I

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
jitter performance so that's when I

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.149 
jitter performance so that's when I
introduced<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.010> isochrone<00:01:11.760> line<00:01:12.710> ISO<00:01:13.710> prefix

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
introduced the isochrone line ISO prefix

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:18.380 
introduced the isochrone line ISO prefix
means<00:01:15.020> constant<00:01:16.020> are<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.350> same<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:17.070> crown<00:01:18.060> is

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
means constant are the same and crown is

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.570 
means constant are the same and crown is
constant<00:01:19.049> time<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:19.979> supposed<00:01:20.340> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
constant time so it's supposed to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.050 
constant time so it's supposed to
suggest<00:01:21.060> of<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.409> elements<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.159> time<00:01:23.490> that<00:01:23.909> are

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
suggest of the elements of time that are

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.179 
suggest of the elements of time that are
being<00:01:25.520> that<00:01:26.520> are<00:01:26.640> stable<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.240> CX<00:01:28.170> name<00:01:28.770> comes

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
being that are stable of CX name comes

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.640 
being that are stable of CX name comes
from<00:01:29.310> control<00:01:30.030> crystal<00:01:30.479> oscillator<00:01:30.960> that<00:01:31.110> we

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
from control crystal oscillator that we

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.230 
from control crystal oscillator that we
started<00:01:32.100> shipping<00:01:32.310> around<00:01:33.439> 2005<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:35.130> we<00:01:36.000> got

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
started shipping around 2005 and we got

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.670

CX people were excited to try out the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.649 
CX people were excited to try out the
new<00:01:58.229> clock<00:01:58.649> from<00:01:58.920> me<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.460> they<00:02:00.299> listened<00:02:00.630> to

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
new clock from me and they listened to

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.410 
new clock from me and they listened to
the<00:02:00.899> oven<00:02:01.290> controlled<00:02:01.920> technology<00:02:02.729> they

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the oven controlled technology they

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.060 
the oven controlled technology they
really<00:02:03.750> liked<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:03.990> way<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.380> sounded<00:02:04.500> they

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
really liked the way it sounded they

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.340 
really liked the way it sounded they
thought<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.490> was<00:02:05.820> doing<00:02:06.630> a<00:02:06.659> lot<00:02:06.780> more<00:02:06.840> to

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
thought it was doing a lot more to

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.290 
thought it was doing a lot more to
improve<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.799> sound<00:02:07.979> quality<00:02:08.160> we<00:02:08.819> now<00:02:08.970> have

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
improve the sound quality we now have

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.559 
improve the sound quality we now have
almost<00:02:09.629> 18<00:02:10.200> years<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:11.099> only<00:02:11.790> and<00:02:12.209> almost

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
almost 18 years and and only and almost

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.250 
almost 18 years and and only and almost
took<00:02:12.720> that

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
took that

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.199 
took that
for<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:13.650> awareness<00:02:13.799> to<00:02:14.220> build<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.760> clock<00:02:15.000> is

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
for the awareness to build the clock is

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.780 
for the awareness to build the clock is
important
