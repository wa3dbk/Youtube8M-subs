00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
yarn I've always been fascinated by the

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.259 
yarn I've always been fascinated by the
connection<00:02:11.360> between<00:02:12.129> knitting<00:02:13.129> and<00:02:13.370> memory

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:14.269 
connection between knitting and memory

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.080 
connection between knitting and memory
and<00:02:14.450> how<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:15.769> Knitting<00:02:16.040> seems<00:02:16.250> to<00:02:16.370> hold<00:02:16.580> on<00:02:16.849> to

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
and how the Knitting seems to hold on to

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.699 
and how the Knitting seems to hold on to
the<00:02:17.180> memories<00:02:17.300> you<00:02:17.569> can<00:02:17.840> remember<00:02:18.410> you<00:02:18.500> pick

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
out of that piece and I I always

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.350 
out of that piece and I I always
wondered<00:02:39.019> why<00:02:39.730> why<00:02:40.730> yeah<00:02:41.420> why<00:02:43.090> but<00:02:44.090> I<00:02:44.120> never

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360 
wondered why why yeah why but I never

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.240 
wondered why why yeah why but I never
really<00:02:44.720> liked<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.019> question<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:46.040> volume

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
really liked the question the volume

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.530 
really liked the question the volume
kind<00:02:46.549> of<00:02:46.610> got<00:02:46.700> turned<00:02:46.880> up<00:02:47.000> on<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.180> question

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
kind of got turned up on the question

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.809 
kind of got turned up on the question
this<00:02:48.470> year<00:02:48.769> I<00:02:48.799> don't<00:02:49.160> know<00:02:49.220> why<00:02:49.370> I<00:02:49.579> just

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:49.819 
this year I don't know why I just

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:51.009 
this year I don't know why I just
decided<00:02:50.000> cool<00:02:50.239> looking<00:02:50.630> for<00:02:50.810> an<00:02:50.870> answer

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
decided cool looking for an answer

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.710 
decided cool looking for an answer
interesting<00:02:52.010> so<00:02:52.190> the<00:02:52.700> idea<00:02:52.819> of<00:02:53.120> memory<00:02:53.540> being

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
interesting so the idea of memory being

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.020 
interesting so the idea of memory being
trapped<00:02:54.230> in<00:02:54.440> a<00:02:54.530> yarn<00:02:54.799> I<00:02:55.130> wanted<00:02:55.610> this<00:02:55.700> to<00:02:55.880> be<00:02:55.910> a

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030 
trapped in a yarn I wanted this to be a

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.100 
trapped in a yarn I wanted this to be a
participatory<00:02:56.810> like<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.680> work<00:02:58.010> between<00:02:58.840> me<00:02:59.840> and

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
participatory like a work between me and

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.630 
participatory like a work between me and
the<00:03:00.170> cast<00:03:00.349> on<00:03:00.530> listeners<00:03:00.890> to<00:03:01.069> invite<00:03:01.310> people

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
the cast on listeners to invite people

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.400 
the cast on listeners to invite people
to<00:03:01.760> play<00:03:01.970> along<00:03:02.239> and<00:03:02.510> be<00:03:02.989> a<00:03:03.019> part<00:03:03.230> of<00:03:03.349> this

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
to play along and be a part of this

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.280 
to play along and be a part of this
project<00:03:03.680> and<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.160> I<00:03:04.400> had<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.450> idea<00:03:05.569> to<00:03:05.810> have

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
project and so I had the idea to have

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.470 
project and so I had the idea to have
people<00:03:06.829> knit<00:03:07.489> little<00:03:07.730> bit<00:03:07.880> memory<00:03:08.180> bags

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
people knit little bit memory bags

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:09.879 
people knit little bit memory bags
little<00:03:08.840> tiny<00:03:09.019> bags<00:03:09.290> that<00:03:09.470> would<00:03:09.590> act<00:03:09.769> as

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
little tiny bags that would act as

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.849 
little tiny bags that would act as
metaphors<00:03:10.579> for<00:03:10.940> holding<00:03:11.900> a<00:03:11.989> memory<00:03:12.290> out<00:03:12.560> of

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:12.859 
metaphors for holding a memory out of

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:14.110 
metaphors for holding a memory out of
their<00:03:12.980> favorite<00:03:13.310> yarn<00:03:13.489> and<00:03:13.760> then<00:03:13.880> write<00:03:14.090> a

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
their favorite yarn and then write a

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.789 
their favorite yarn and then write a
little<00:03:14.329> something<00:03:14.630> about<00:03:14.690> it<00:03:15.019> to<00:03:15.200> tell<00:03:15.680> me

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
little something about it to tell me

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.410 
little something about it to tell me
what<00:03:15.950> the<00:03:16.040> memory<00:03:16.310> was<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.760> they've<00:03:17.120> been

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
what the memory was and they've been

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.360 
what the memory was and they've been
coming<00:03:17.840> in<00:03:18.079> we<00:03:18.230> have<00:03:18.410> we<00:03:18.620> have<00:03:18.680> a<00:03:18.739> little<00:03:18.980> tree
