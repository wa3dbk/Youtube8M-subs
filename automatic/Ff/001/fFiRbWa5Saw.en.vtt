00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.520 
I think solo duet ensemble they're all
really<00:00:25.760> enjoyable<00:00:26.240> to<00:00:26.449> do<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:27.080> solar<00:00:27.320> stuff

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:27.530 
really enjoyable to do the solar stuff

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.430 
really enjoyable to do the solar stuff
is<00:00:27.680> amazing<00:00:28.130> because<00:00:28.490> you<00:00:29.240> can<00:00:29.810> change<00:00:30.289> it

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:30.440 
is amazing because you can change it

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.650 
is amazing because you can change it
over<00:00:30.500> time<00:00:30.830> according<00:00:31.400> to<00:00:31.520> how<00:00:31.670> you<00:00:31.730> need<00:00:32.149> even

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
over time according to how you need even

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.420 
over time according to how you need even
if<00:00:32.750> it's<00:00:32.899> really<00:00:33.140> subtle<00:00:33.350> but<00:00:33.710> you<00:00:34.160> might<00:00:34.309> know

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
if it's really subtle but you might know

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.139 
if it's really subtle but you might know
you<00:00:34.520> need<00:00:34.640> to<00:00:34.699> approach<00:00:34.910> it<00:00:35.059> differently

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
you need to approach it differently

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:36.700 
you need to approach it differently
might<00:00:35.629> be<00:00:35.720> feeling<00:00:35.899> differently<00:00:36.350> one<00:00:36.530> night

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
might be feeling differently one night

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.260 
might be feeling differently one night
so<00:00:36.920> you<00:00:37.040> need<00:00:37.250> to<00:00:37.399> come<00:00:37.610> out<00:00:37.640> from<00:00:37.970> a<00:00:38.000> different

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:38.270 
so you need to come out from a different

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.630 
so you need to come out from a different
angle<00:00:38.329> and<00:00:38.690> you<00:00:39.350> move<00:00:39.560> might<00:00:39.770> be<00:00:39.920> different<00:00:40.100> so

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
angle and you move might be different so

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.610 
angle and you move might be different so
there's<00:00:40.820> that<00:00:40.880> kind<00:00:41.120> of<00:00:41.270> freedom<00:00:41.570> with<00:00:42.260> do<00:00:42.500> at

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.260 
there's that kind of freedom with do at
work<00:00:42.770> I<00:00:43.010> love<00:00:43.309> that<00:00:43.489> there's<00:00:43.730> that<00:00:43.790> private

I<00:00:55.220> wish<00:00:55.400> that<00:00:55.550> we<00:00:55.730> could<00:00:56.420> do<00:00:56.540> that<00:00:56.630> every<00:00:56.900> time

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
I wish that we could do that every time

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.560 
I wish that we could do that every time
because<00:00:58.400> that<00:00:58.670> really<00:00:58.820> changed<00:00:59.180> as<00:00:59.270> well<00:00:59.300> then

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
because that really changed as well then

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:00.729 
because that really changed as well then
there<00:00:59.690> was<00:00:59.780> a<00:00:59.809> third<00:01:00.020> party<00:01:00.410> in<00:01:00.530> asserting

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
there was a third party in asserting

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:01.810 
there was a third party in asserting
themselves<00:01:00.980> and<00:01:01.370> then<00:01:01.460> there<00:01:01.610> was<00:01:01.670> the

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:01.820 
themselves and then there was the

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.860 
themselves and then there was the
musicians<00:01:02.270> and<00:01:02.390> then<00:01:02.540> there<00:01:02.690> was<00:01:02.750> the

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
musicians and then there was the

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.869 
musicians and then there was the
audience<00:01:03.200> but<00:01:03.350> we're<00:01:04.010> all<00:01:04.160> kind<00:01:04.430> of<00:01:04.489> trying<00:01:04.790> to

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
audience but we're all kind of trying to

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.630 
audience but we're all kind of trying to
communicate<00:01:05.840> with<00:01:05.960> each<00:01:05.990> other<00:01:06.520> that<00:01:07.520> was

dancing<00:01:42.270> is<00:01:42.390> when<00:01:42.630> you<00:01:43.350> transcend<00:01:43.860> your

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
dancing is when you transcend your

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.760 
dancing is when you transcend your
rational<00:01:45.150> mind<00:01:45.180> a<00:01:45.509> little<00:01:45.630> bit<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.590> kind

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
rational mind a little bit and you kind

rational mind a little bit and you kind
of<00:01:46.800> go<00:01:46.950> to<00:01:47.009> another<00:01:47.220> place<00:01:47.430> where<00:01:48.830> you<00:01:49.830> just

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
of go to another place where you just

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:06.760 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.150 

I<00:02:06.820> grew<00:02:07.570> up<00:02:07.600> in<00:02:07.870> Perth<00:02:08.229> and<00:02:08.470> trained<00:02:08.890> at<00:02:09.010> water

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
I grew up in Perth and trained at water

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.830 
I grew up in Perth and trained at water
for<00:02:09.369> four<00:02:09.550> years<00:02:09.700> and<00:02:10.030> then<00:02:10.180> I<00:02:10.270> decided<00:02:10.630> that<00:02:10.720> I

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
for four years and then I decided that I

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.570 
for four years and then I decided that I
wanted<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.110> go<00:02:11.260> see<00:02:11.500> so<00:02:12.040> I've<00:02:12.130> been<00:02:12.340> in<00:02:12.460> London

wanted to go see so I've been in London

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.400 
wanted to go see so I've been in London
for<00:02:12.760> nearly<00:02:13.000> three<00:02:13.240> years<00:02:13.270> before<00:02:13.690> I<00:02:14.260> actually

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
for nearly three years before I actually

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.830 
for nearly three years before I actually
met<00:02:15.010> wrath<00:02:15.220> then<00:02:15.760> I<00:02:15.850> went<00:02:16.060> for<00:02:16.300> an<00:02:16.570> audition

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
met wrath then I went for an audition

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.450 
met wrath then I went for an audition
