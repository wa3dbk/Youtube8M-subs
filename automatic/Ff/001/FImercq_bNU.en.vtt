00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
this is the first time you've installed

this is the first time you've installed
it<00:01:22.560> or<00:01:22.790> you<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.030> got<00:01:24.150> done<00:01:24.299> cleaning<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.840> the

it or you just got done cleaning it the
water<00:01:26.340> is<00:01:26.729> going<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.150> be<00:01:27.240> crystal<00:01:27.570> clear<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
water is going to be crystal clear and

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.330 
water is going to be crystal clear and
what<00:01:28.500> you're<00:01:28.590> going<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.770> want<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:28.950> do<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.220> hold

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
what you're going to want to do is hold

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.340 
what you're going to want to do is hold
your<00:01:29.520> thumb<00:01:29.670> over<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:30.060> air<00:01:30.299> airline<00:01:30.930> input

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
your thumb over this air airline input

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.060 
your thumb over this air airline input
and<00:01:31.619> at<00:01:32.579> some<00:01:32.909> point<00:01:33.150> it's<00:01:33.509> gonna<00:01:33.829> suck<00:01:34.829> all

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
and at some point it's gonna suck all

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.039 
and at some point it's gonna suck all
the<00:01:35.100> air<00:01:35.430> that's<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.119> in<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.479> pipe<00:01:36.689> out

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
the air that's in this in the pipe out

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.560 
the air that's in this in the pipe out
and<00:01:37.530> I<00:01:38.100> think<00:01:38.159> it<00:01:38.400> gives<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> burst<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.360> air

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
and I think it gives like a burst of air

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.980 
and I think it gives like a burst of air
all<00:01:40.079> of<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.290> sudden<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:41.640> can<00:01:42.600> kind<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.810> let

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
all of a sudden and you can kind of let

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.749 
all of a sudden and you can kind of let
it<00:01:43.020> go<00:01:43.110> and<00:01:43.259> it'll<00:01:43.890> start<00:01:44.040> filling<00:01:44.399> up<00:01:44.579> with

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
it go and it'll start filling up with

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.460 
it go and it'll start filling up with
foam<00:01:44.939> just<00:01:45.299> like<00:01:45.420> that

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
foam just like that

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.750 
foam just like that
so<00:01:47.870> there's<00:01:48.870> that<00:01:49.260> that's<00:01:49.650> how<00:01:50.310> you<00:01:50.340> get<00:01:50.610> it

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
so there's that that's how you get it

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.300 
so there's that that's how you get it
going<00:01:51.680> say<00:01:52.680> then<00:01:52.920> you're<00:01:53.040> gonna<00:01:53.190> obviously

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
going say then you're gonna obviously

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.560 
going say then you're gonna obviously
want<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.730> put<00:01:53.880> your<00:01:54.140> silence<00:01:55.140> around<00:01:56.120> and<00:01:57.120> then

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
want to put your silence around and then

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.900 
want to put your silence around and then
it's<00:01:57.930> what<00:01:58.080> was<00:01:58.230> where<00:01:58.500> do<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.950> keep<00:01:59.310> my<00:01:59.580> air

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
it's what was where do I keep my air

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.970 
it's what was where do I keep my air
bubbles<00:02:02.360> what<00:02:03.360> I<00:02:03.390> like<00:02:03.660> to<00:02:03.810> do<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.260> I<00:02:04.680> take<00:02:04.860> this

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980 
bubbles what I like to do is I take this

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:06.920 
bubbles what I like to do is I take this

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.070 
should do to just kind of set the rubber
band<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.030> little<00:02:09.149> low<00:02:09.360> here<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:12.810> can<00:02:12.960> be<00:02:13.050> a

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
band a little low here and it can be a

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.410 
band a little low here and it can be a
pain<00:02:13.320> sometimes<00:02:13.350> but<00:02:13.980> I<00:02:14.490> love<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:15.090> design<00:02:15.210> of

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
pain sometimes but I love the design of

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.850 
pain sometimes but I love the design of
this<00:02:15.600> thing<00:02:15.840> so<00:02:15.870> I<00:02:16.170> wouldn't<00:02:16.500> trade<00:02:16.710> it<00:02:16.740> for

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
this thing so I wouldn't trade it for

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.270 
this thing so I wouldn't trade it for
anything

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
anything

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.080 
anything
so<00:02:18.150> what<00:02:18.720> I'll<00:02:18.840> do<00:02:19.050> is<00:02:19.100> I'll<00:02:20.100> take<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.490> set<00:02:20.970> it

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
so what I'll do is I'll take it set it

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.180 
so what I'll do is I'll take it set it
down<00:02:21.120> in<00:02:21.360> here<00:02:24.290> what<00:02:25.290> I<00:02:25.320> want<00:02:25.650> to<00:02:25.710> look<00:02:25.860> for

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
down in here what I want to look for

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.930 
down in here what I want to look for
when<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.210> set<00:02:27.600> mine<00:02:27.810> up<00:02:27.840> is<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:29.250> cylinder<00:02:29.790> down

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
when I set mine up is that cylinder down

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.400 
when I set mine up is that cylinder down
at<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.120> bottom<00:02:30.300> I<00:02:30.570> want<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> bubbles<00:02:31.170> to<00:02:31.290> be

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
at the bottom I want the bubbles to be

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.610 
at the bottom I want the bubbles to be
right<00:02:31.650> at<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:32.570> I<00:02:36.080> think<00:02:37.080> it's<00:02:37.170> hard<00:02:37.350> to<00:02:37.440> say

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
right at it I think it's hard to say

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.580 
right at it I think it's hard to say
right<00:02:37.830> now<00:02:37.890> actually<00:02:38.640> right<00:02:39.030> now<00:02:39.320> I've<00:02:40.320> tried

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
right now actually right now I've tried

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.260 
right now actually right now I've tried
to<00:02:40.740> make<00:02:40.770> this<00:02:40.980> video<00:02:41.280> so<00:02:41.340> many<00:02:41.760> times<00:02:42.000> this

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
to make this video so many times this

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.700 
to make this video so many times this
thing<00:02:42.510> has<00:02:42.690> been<00:02:42.720> sitting<00:02:42.870> with<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.290> cup<00:02:43.530> off

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
thing has been sitting with a cup off

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.940 
thing has been sitting with a cup off
for<00:02:44.160> so<00:02:44.280> long<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.490> think<00:02:44.790> it's<00:02:44.940> trying<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.600> skim

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
for so long I think it's trying to skim

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.950 
for so long I think it's trying to skim
but<00:02:46.950> what<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.340> really<00:02:47.610> want<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.030> do<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.690> where

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
but what you really want to do is where

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:52.370 
but what you really want to do is where
that<00:02:49.140> cylinder<00:02:49.590> starts<00:02:50.660> to<00:02:51.660> come<00:02:51.870> up<00:02:52.050> that's

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
that cylinder starts to come up that's

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.470 
that cylinder starts to come up that's
where<00:02:52.680> you<00:02:52.770> want<00:02:52.980> your<00:02:53.100> bubbles<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.610> be<00:02:53.730> don't

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
where you want your bubbles to be don't

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.720 
where you want your bubbles to be don't
