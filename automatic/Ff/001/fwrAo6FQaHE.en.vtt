these touch-enabled displays it it is

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.090 
these touch-enabled displays it it is
kind<00:02:02.850> of<00:02:02.880> good<00:02:03.090> because<00:02:03.450> when<00:02:03.930> windows<00:02:04.320> 8<00:02:04.590> does

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
kind of good because when windows 8 does

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.160 
kind of good because when windows 8 does
come<00:02:05.369> out<00:02:05.610> which<00:02:05.969> it<00:02:06.180> will<00:02:06.270> probably<00:02:06.600> attended

the<00:02:07.259> Sierra<00:02:07.560> hopefully<00:02:08.039> actually<00:02:08.700> I<00:02:08.910> think<00:02:09.000> it

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
the Sierra hopefully actually I think it

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:10.669 
the Sierra hopefully actually I think it
was<00:02:09.390> announced<00:02:09.720> by<00:02:09.810> Microsoft<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.289> just<00:02:10.500> don't

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
was announced by Microsoft I just don't

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.800 
was announced by Microsoft I just don't
have<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.950> date<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.250> my<00:02:11.370> mind<00:02:11.610> by<00:02:11.760> anyways

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
have that date in my mind by anyways

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.570 
have that date in my mind by anyways
windows<00:02:13.110> 8<00:02:13.319> does<00:02:13.530> come<00:02:13.709> out<00:02:13.800> these<00:02:14.040> desktops

windows 8 does come out these desktops
will<00:02:14.849> most<00:02:15.000> likely<00:02:15.209> be<00:02:15.360> able<00:02:15.540> to<00:02:15.630> upgrade<00:02:15.780> or

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
will most likely be able to upgrade or

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.140 
will most likely be able to upgrade or
you<00:02:16.290> can<00:02:16.500> still<00:02:16.800> upgrade<00:02:17.040> them<00:02:17.459> because<00:02:18.000> they

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
you can still upgrade them because they

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:19.790 
you can still upgrade them because they
are<00:02:18.180> going<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.510> be<00:02:18.630> running<00:02:18.840> quad<00:02:19.140> core<00:02:19.440> and

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
is it is a bit more powerful and I'll

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.699 
is it is a bit more powerful and I'll
start<00:03:13.830> a<00:03:13.970> 799<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.269> if<00:03:15.870> you<00:03:16.019> want<00:03:16.230> to<00:03:16.319> go<00:03:16.410> a<00:03:16.440> bit

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
start a 799 and if you want to go a bit
