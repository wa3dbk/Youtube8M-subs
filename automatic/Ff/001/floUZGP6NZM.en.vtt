internet about these things and we kind
of<00:00:19.680> wanted<00:00:19.949> to<00:00:20.100> investigate<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.820> little<00:00:20.880> bit

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
of wanted to investigate a little bit

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.630 
of wanted to investigate a little bit
and<00:00:21.390> learn<00:00:21.600> more<00:00:21.869> about<00:00:21.960> these<00:00:22.289> filters<00:00:22.769> so

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
and learn more about these filters so

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.099 
and learn more about these filters so
here's<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.720> deal

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
here's the deal

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.410 
here's the deal
the<00:00:25.500> philosophy<00:00:26.160> behind<00:00:26.310> this<00:00:26.609> filter<00:00:27.029> was

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
the philosophy behind this filter was

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.080 
the philosophy behind this filter was
that<00:00:27.660> royal<00:00:28.140> purple<00:00:28.410> advertises<00:00:29.279> an<00:00:29.490> extended

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
that royal purple advertises an extended

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.080 
that royal purple advertises an extended
length<00:00:30.240> oil<00:00:30.599> change<00:00:31.380> period<00:00:32.250> meaning<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:32.969> can

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
length oil change period meaning you can

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.120 
length oil change period meaning you can
run<00:00:33.300> royal<00:00:33.690> purple<00:00:33.899> synthetic<00:00:34.380> oil<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.920> little

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
run royal purple synthetic oil a little

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.610 
run royal purple synthetic oil a little
bit<00:00:35.340> longer<00:00:35.579> in<00:00:35.820> your<00:00:35.910> car<00:00:36.180> than<00:00:36.750> traditional

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
bit longer in your car than traditional

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.790 
bit longer in your car than traditional
organic<00:00:38.579> oil<00:00:38.790> but<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:39.600> they<00:00:39.690> figured<00:00:40.110> you

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
organic oil but then they figured you

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.380 
organic oil but then they figured you
can<00:00:40.980> run<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> oil<00:00:41.399> longer<00:00:41.910> but<00:00:42.149> there's<00:00:42.329> a

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
can run the oil longer but there's a

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.110 
can run the oil longer but there's a
standard<00:00:42.750> oil<00:00:42.899> filter<00:00:43.469> stand<00:00:44.040> up<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.579> provide

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
standard oil filter stand up and provide

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.869 
standard oil filter stand up and provide
filtering<00:00:45.780> capability<00:00:46.500> for<00:00:47.070> that<00:00:47.160> longer<00:00:47.489> oil

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
filtering capability for that longer oil

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.569 
filtering capability for that longer oil
change<00:00:48.270> interval<00:00:48.930> and<00:00:49.170> that's<00:00:49.800> why<00:00:50.010> they<00:00:50.370> work

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
change interval and that's why they work

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.150 
change interval and that's why they work
with<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.789> manufacturer<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.809> come<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:52.140> with<00:00:52.350> this

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
with a manufacturer to come up with this

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.700 
with a manufacturer to come up with this
filter<00:00:53.879> now<00:00:54.449> royal<00:00:55.079> purple<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.469> an<00:00:55.559> oil

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.860 
capability to make a metal oil filter
in-house<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.850> they<00:01:02.969> contacted<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.690> company

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
in-house so they contacted a company

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
the biggest oil filter company in the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.190 
the biggest oil filter company in the
world<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:09.240> specifically<00:01:09.780> designed

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
world and they specifically designed

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.899 
world and they specifically designed
this<00:01:10.350> filter<00:01:10.740> and<00:01:10.770> champion<00:01:11.490> actually<00:01:11.760> does<00:01:11.880> a

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
this filter and champion actually does a

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.300 
this filter and champion actually does a
manufacturing<00:01:12.600> and<00:01:12.810> of<00:01:13.439> course<00:01:13.680> this<00:01:13.890> created

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
manufacturing and of course this created

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.399 
manufacturing and of course this created
a<00:01:14.369> buzz<00:01:14.549> on<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.820> internet<00:01:14.850> because<00:01:15.689> champion

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
a buzz on the internet because champion

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.950 
a buzz on the internet because champion
does<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.400> bunch<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.759> different<00:01:18.210> brands<00:01:18.450> of<00:01:18.750> oil

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
does a bunch of different brands of oil

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.719 
does a bunch of different brands of oil
filters<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.770> not<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.280> royal<00:01:20.490> purple

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
filters and not just the royal purple

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.330 
filters and not just the royal purple
one<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.150> some<00:01:21.780> people<00:01:22.080> were<00:01:22.200> suggesting<00:01:22.890> that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
one and some people were suggesting that

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.230 
one and some people were suggesting that
maybe<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:24.000> royal<00:01:24.990> purple<00:01:25.290> filter<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:26.240> similar

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
maybe the royal purple filter is similar

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.969 
maybe the royal purple filter is similar
to<00:01:27.390> another<00:01:27.509> champion<00:01:28.200> filter<00:01:28.560> but<00:01:28.740> it's<00:01:28.860> just

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
to another champion filter but it's just

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.130 
to another champion filter but it's just
painted<00:01:29.460> purple<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.119> maybe<00:01:30.540> that's<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.960> big

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
painted purple and maybe that's the big

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.800 
painted purple and maybe that's the big
difference<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:32.610> read<00:01:32.850> that<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.299> decided

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
difference so we read that and decided

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.319 
difference so we read that and decided
to<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:35.070> really<00:01:35.369> find<00:01:35.640> out<00:01:35.759> what's<00:01:35.970> going<00:01:36.180> on

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
to to really find out what's going on

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.450 
to to really find out what's going on
inside<00:01:36.630> here<00:01:36.930> by<00:01:37.500> destroying<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:38.070> couple<00:01:38.369> of

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
inside here by destroying a couple of

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.340 
inside here by destroying a couple of
them<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.720> first<00:01:39.930> thing<00:01:40.110> you'll<00:01:40.229> notice

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
them so the first thing you'll notice

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.480 
them so the first thing you'll notice
with<00:01:42.229> this<00:01:43.229> being<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.560> royal<00:01:43.770> purple<00:01:44.040> filter

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
with this being a royal purple filter

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.399 
with this being a royal purple filter
here<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.820> we've<00:01:44.909> cut<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.180> half<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.170> one

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
here that we've cut in half and this one

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.950 
here that we've cut in half and this one
is<00:01:46.649> another<00:01:47.159> filter<00:01:48.000> manufactured<00:01:48.840> by

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
is another filter manufactured by

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.289 
is another filter manufactured by
champion<00:01:49.439> labs<00:01:49.649> they<00:01:50.640> both<00:01:50.850> have<00:01:51.060> very

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
champion labs they both have very

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.590 
champion labs they both have very
similar<00:01:51.600> writing<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.350> the<00:01:52.470> top<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.299> that<00:01:54.299> kind

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
similar writing on the top and that kind

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.060 
similar writing on the top and that kind
of<00:01:54.659> gives<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.960> an<00:01:55.020> idea<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.380> yeah<00:01:55.710> these<00:01:55.920> are

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
of gives you an idea that yeah these are

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.620 
of gives you an idea that yeah these are
probably<00:01:56.340> made<00:01:56.490> on<00:01:56.640> the<00:01:56.729> same<00:01:56.909> manufacturing

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
probably made on the same manufacturing

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:00.679 
probably made on the same manufacturing
line<00:01:57.979> it's<00:01:58.979> just<00:01:59.159> some<00:01:59.310> evidence<00:01:59.759> but<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.420> think

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
line it's just some evidence but I think

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.810 
line it's just some evidence but I think
that's<00:02:00.869> where<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.350> similarities<00:02:02.040> end

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
that's where the similarities end

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.609 
that's where the similarities end
we'll<00:02:03.509> go<00:02:03.630> ahead<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:03.869> take<00:02:04.079> a<00:02:04.140> look<00:02:04.350> at<00:02:04.469> the

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
we'll go ahead and take a look at the

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.730 
we'll go ahead and take a look at the
non<00:02:04.920> royal<00:02:05.369> purple<00:02:05.670> one<00:02:05.909> first<00:02:06.560> first<00:02:07.560> thing

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.479 
non royal purple one first first thing
you'll<00:02:07.860> see<00:02:08.209> when<00:02:09.209> we<00:02:09.330> take<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:09.660> cover<00:02:09.840> off<00:02:09.989> is

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
you'll see when we take the cover off is

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:13.830 
you'll see when we take the cover off is
that<00:02:11.489> the<00:02:11.879> thickness<00:02:12.360> of<00:02:12.540> this

that the thickness of this

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.600

so<00:03:11.440> that<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.620> know<00:03:11.770> bursts<00:03:12.250> the<00:03:12.370> filter<00:03:12.700> and

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
so that you know bursts the filter and

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.130 
so that you know bursts the filter and
drain<00:03:13.000> all<00:03:13.120> your<00:03:13.150> oil<00:03:13.510> out<00:03:13.630> so<00:03:13.870> that's<00:03:14.020> the

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
drain all your oil out so that's the

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:16.320 
drain all your oil out so that's the
deal<00:03:14.290> there<00:03:14.500> so<00:03:14.740> we<00:03:14.980> noticed<00:03:15.340> a<00:03:15.550> measurable

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.330 
deal there so we noticed a measurable

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.830 
time it just is
that's<00:03:45.100> what<00:03:45.220> paper<00:03:45.430> does<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:46.030> it's<00:03:46.660> going<00:03:46.750> to

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:46.840 
that's what paper does and it's going to

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.520 
that's what paper does and it's going to
lose<00:03:47.020> its<00:03:47.260> ability<00:03:47.350> to<00:03:47.710> filter<00:03:48.280> properly<00:03:48.730> and

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 
lose its ability to filter properly and

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:51.930 
lose its ability to filter properly and
they<00:03:50.530> thought<00:03:50.800> that<00:03:51.070> maybe<00:03:51.250> it<00:03:51.460> wasn't<00:03:51.640> such<00:03:51.910> a

they thought that maybe it wasn't such a

they thought that maybe it wasn't such a
good<00:03:52.120> idea<00:03:52.240> to<00:03:52.510> run<00:03:52.690> paper<00:03:52.990> for<00:03:53.350> an<00:03:53.410> extended

and<00:04:09.880> you<00:04:10.360> can<00:04:10.510> also<00:04:10.660> tell<00:04:11.020> here<00:04:11.410> that<00:04:11.710> it's

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
and you can also tell here that it's

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.790 
and you can also tell here that it's
backed<00:04:12.160> by<00:04:12.310> wire<00:04:12.760> so<00:04:13.630> high-pressure<00:04:14.380> isn't

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
going to make this thing come apart it's

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.260 
going to make this thing come apart it's

definitely<00:04:22.270> different<00:04:22.690> stuff<00:04:22.900> inside<00:04:23.080> and

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
definitely different stuff inside and

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.250 
definitely different stuff inside and
this<00:04:24.010> is<00:04:24.190> also<00:04:24.550> designed<00:04:25.090> to<00:04:25.210> filter<00:04:25.450> down

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
this is also designed to filter down

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.360 
this is also designed to filter down
25<00:04:26.890> microns<00:04:27.550> with<00:04:28.240> like<00:04:28.480> over<00:04:29.050> 90%<00:04:29.800> filter

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
25 microns with like over 90% filter

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:32.760 
25 microns with like over 90% filter
capability<00:04:31.030> so<00:04:31.300> it's<00:04:31.690> also<00:04:31.930> a<00:04:32.050> good<00:04:32.440> filter

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
capability so it's also a good filter

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:34.890 
capability so it's also a good filter
media<00:04:33.250> and<00:04:33.490> not<00:04:33.640> just<00:04:33.880> a<00:04:33.970> longer-lasting<00:04:34.300> one

then we dig a little bit deeper and we

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.320 
then we dig a little bit deeper and we

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
little bit and of course they made it

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.010 
little bit and of course they made it

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 
in cold weather hot weather and it

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.920 
in cold weather hot weather and it
doesn't<00:05:13.570> matter<00:05:13.690> and<00:05:14.080> then<00:05:14.650> it's<00:05:15.280> got<00:05:15.460> a

00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:15.930 
doesn't matter and then it's got a

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.630 
doesn't matter and then it's got a
beefed<00:05:16.930> up<00:05:17.170> gasket<00:05:17.740> here<00:05:17.920> so<00:05:18.190> that<00:05:18.370> it<00:05:18.610> doesn't

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
beefed up gasket here so that it doesn't

you<00:05:19.090> know<00:05:19.210> leak<00:05:19.660> against<00:05:20.050> the<00:05:20.140> engine<00:05:20.470> block

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
you know leak against the engine block

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.350 
you know leak against the engine block
but<00:05:20.710> I<00:05:20.950> think<00:05:21.160> all<00:05:21.310> the<00:05:21.400> champ<00:05:21.640> labs<00:05:21.940> filters

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
but I think all the champ labs filters

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.080 
but I think all the champ labs filters
have<00:05:22.570> a<00:05:22.600> decent<00:05:23.230> gasket<00:05:23.710> but<00:05:24.250> I<00:05:24.310> think<00:05:24.580> the<00:05:24.700> the

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
have a decent gasket but I think the the

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:27.240 
have a decent gasket but I think the the
base<00:05:25.360> plate<00:05:25.660> is<00:05:25.690> also<00:05:26.140> a<00:05:26.170> thicker<00:05:26.470> material<00:05:26.650> on

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
base plate is also a thicker material on

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.940 
base plate is also a thicker material on
the<00:05:27.370> purple<00:05:27.700> one<00:05:27.880> to<00:05:28.840> keep<00:05:29.050> the<00:05:29.260> filter<00:05:29.680> a

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
the purple one to keep the filter a

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.550 
the purple one to keep the filter a
little<00:05:30.220> bit<00:05:30.460> stronger<00:05:30.990> so<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.230> bottom<00:05:32.530> line

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 
little bit stronger so the bottom line

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.430 
little bit stronger so the bottom line
is<00:05:33.100> that<00:05:33.370> if<00:05:33.670> you're<00:05:33.820> going<00:05:33.910> to<00:05:34.000> go<00:05:34.120> for<00:05:34.330> the

synthetic oil which is one of the
benefits<00:05:40.050> it's<00:05:41.050> a<00:05:41.200> good<00:05:41.320> idea<00:05:41.440> to<00:05:41.620> use<00:05:41.800> the

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
benefits it's a good idea to use the

right filter and the royal purple filter
it<00:05:43.900> really<00:05:44.080> comes<00:05:44.320> through<00:05:44.620> and<00:05:45.070> there's<00:05:45.430> some

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
it really comes through and there's some

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.640 
it really comes through and there's some
legitimate<00:05:45.610> design<00:05:46.420> enhancements<00:05:47.140> to<00:05:47.620> make

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
legitimate design enhancements to make

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.750 
legitimate design enhancements to make
it<00:05:47.890> worth<00:05:48.040> your<00:05:48.190> while

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760

a store locator or even get one close to

you and I think our next adventure will
be<00:05:57.760> to<00:05:57.940> run<00:05:58.150> these<00:05:58.300> on<00:05:58.480> a<00:05:58.510> car<00:05:58.780> and<00:05:59.050> then<00:05:59.230> cut
