00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
gun I would find myself using in ground

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.460 
gun I would find myself using in ground
war<00:01:08.330> it<00:01:09.330> just<00:01:09.540> isn't<00:01:09.659> good<00:01:09.869> taking<00:01:10.200> out<00:01:10.260> lots

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
war it just isn't good taking out lots

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.620 
war it just isn't good taking out lots
people<00:01:10.860> at<00:01:11.070> once<00:01:11.400> yeah<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.210> if<00:01:12.270> it's<00:01:12.450> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
people at once yeah but if it's you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.420 
people at once yeah but if it's you
versus<00:01:13.080> one<00:01:13.229> person<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.979> win<00:01:14.250> pretty

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
versus one person you can win pretty

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.770 
versus one person you can win pretty
well<00:01:14.700> if<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.909> gun<00:01:15.090> it's<00:01:15.299> definitely<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
well if this gun it's definitely the

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.060 
well if this gun it's definitely the
best<00:01:15.930> long-range<00:01:16.200> submachine<00:01:16.950> gun

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
best long-range submachine gun

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.530 
best long-range submachine gun
definitely<00:01:17.580> better<00:01:17.759> than<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:18.000> Peacekeeper

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
definitely better than the Peacekeeper

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.640 
definitely better than the Peacekeeper
just<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:18.990> it's<00:01:19.080> a<00:01:19.140> purse<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.590> know

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
just because it's a purse you know

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.080 
just because it's a purse you know
you're<00:01:19.799> very<00:01:19.979> accurate<00:01:20.490> with<00:01:20.580> your<00:01:20.700> shots<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
you're very accurate with your shots the

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.219 
you're very accurate with your shots the
Peacekeeper<00:01:21.570> wall<00:01:21.720> it's<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.840> good<00:01:22.020> long-range

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
Peacekeeper wall it's a good long-range

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.920 
Peacekeeper wall it's a good long-range
submachine<00:01:22.950> gun<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.939> it's<00:01:24.479> not<00:01:24.689> that

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
submachine gun it just it's not that

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.450 
submachine gun it just it's not that
accurate<00:01:25.200> are<00:01:25.500> you<00:01:25.650> going<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.100> other<00:01:26.250> with

it's now 1920 x 1080 which matches this
exact<00:03:14.260> resolution<00:03:14.470> so<00:03:15.010> I<00:03:15.040> think<00:03:15.099> my<00:03:15.430> quality

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849 
exact resolution so I think my quality

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.399 
exact resolution so I think my quality
can<00:03:16.000> even<00:03:16.209> get<00:03:16.329> better<00:03:16.750> than<00:03:17.079> what<00:03:17.290> it<00:03:17.379> is

00:03:17.399 --> 00:03:17.409 
can even get better than what it is

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.659 
can even get better than what it is
right<00:03:17.530> now<00:03:18.150> hmm<00:03:19.150> hmm<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.470> don't<00:03:20.949> know<00:03:21.159> is<00:03:21.430> that's
