 why now going 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.290
 to change this luck without knowing 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.230
 capital to lay death 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:35.130

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.530
 death 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.250
 because if 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:46.530
 because there are too many balls to kill her with 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.530
 the chest and not throw it out 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:53.950
 to play from home any court 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.520
 although a little the heart 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:56.520
 until 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:05.140
 let's dance to change this luck 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.890

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.890
 death 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:16.150
 to change destination 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.150
 at the end of the football game 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.990
 place 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.810
 every time well for the superclassic of 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.000

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.760
 housing appreciates it 0 am I always 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.560
 I always see 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.240
 and they win they always win national 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.790
 gaining time so I do not think I have 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.900
 a problem 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:48.260
 and your team as you saw it in the middle of 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.260
 final 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.160
 aside you came a little more 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.160
 tired 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.340
 to adapt 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.870
 to study 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.320
 wrote this for tomorrow's game 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.320
 Yes of course 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.660

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.390
 Super classic 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.970
 it had never happened that they mix with 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.420
 the expansion players and the team 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.420
 first 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:44.810
 and they also took advantage of the weather 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.950
 the girls could swim around 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:58.129

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.959

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:04.580
