00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.420
 very simple we will accompany to 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:22.610
 a pizza for empanadas for sandwiches 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.380

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:29.600
 leave in the refrigerator 24 hours 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.830

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:56.420
 only about 3 tablespoons goes 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:59.390
 onion does not sing about 2 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.410

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.379

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.909

 I want the joke and I take the tomato 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:49.540

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.320
