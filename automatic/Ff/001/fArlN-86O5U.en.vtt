drive<00:00:14.500> time<00:00:14.740> up<00:00:14.920> you<00:00:15.070> don't<00:00:15.160> think<00:00:15.429> i<00:00:15.580> would

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:15.639 
drive time up you don't think i would

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:18.599 
drive time up you don't think i would
think<00:00:15.940> maybe<00:00:16.209> heating<00:00:16.840> it<00:00:16.990> my<00:00:17.410> air<00:00:18.250> so<00:00:18.430> wait

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:18.609 
think maybe heating it my air so wait

that's<00:00:19.029> a<00:00:19.119> little<00:00:19.240> ride<00:00:19.480> on<00:00:19.510> pleasure<00:00:20.170> I<00:00:20.680> mean

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
that's a little ride on pleasure I mean

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.109 
that's a little ride on pleasure I mean
if<00:00:20.920> we<00:00:21.039> can<00:00:21.189> get<00:00:21.279> this<00:00:21.430> stuff<00:00:21.640> to<00:00:21.670> stick<00:00:21.970> to<00:00:22.090> a

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
if we can get this stuff to stick to a

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:22.980 
if we can get this stuff to stick to a
lot<00:00:22.240> of<00:00:22.330> things<00:00:22.480> what<00:00:22.600> kind<00:00:22.750> of<00:00:22.779> other

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
lot of things what kind of other

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.870 
lot of things what kind of other
applications<00:00:23.199> you<00:00:23.980> see<00:00:24.220> where<00:00:24.460> this<00:00:24.550> could<00:00:24.730> be

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:24.880 
applications you see where this could be

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.490 
applications you see where this could be
a<00:00:24.910> real<00:00:25.150> benefit<00:00:25.480> what<00:00:25.720> I<00:00:25.750> think<00:00:26.109> everybody

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:26.500 
a real benefit what I think everybody

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.380 
a real benefit what I think everybody
needs<00:00:26.710> is<00:00:27.130> something<00:00:27.490> to<00:00:27.640> take<00:00:27.760> your<00:00:28.119> cell

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:28.390 
needs is something to take your cell

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.439 
needs is something to take your cell
phone<00:00:28.630> and<00:00:28.900> drop<00:00:29.650> it<00:00:29.800> in<00:00:30.010> a<00:00:30.220> sink<00:00:30.519> and<00:00:30.730> have<00:00:31.330> it

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:31.449 
phone and drop it in a sink and have it

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.360 
phone and drop it in a sink and have it
come<00:00:31.480> out<00:00:31.779> unscathed<00:00:32.080> you're<00:00:32.860> right<00:00:33.010> have<00:00:33.219> you

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
come out unscathed you're right have you

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.620 
come out unscathed you're right have you
thought<00:00:33.579> about<00:00:33.640> that<00:00:33.969> they<00:00:34.120> focused<00:00:34.480> on

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
thought about that they focused on

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.780 
thought about that they focused on
clothing<00:00:34.930> yeah<00:00:35.410> yeah<00:00:35.980> well<00:00:36.520> as<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:36.760> other

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
clothing yeah yeah well as the other

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.850 
clothing yeah yeah well as the other
Marcus<00:00:37.329> might<00:00:37.510> be<00:00:37.660> much<00:00:37.809> better<00:00:37.960> even<00:00:38.410> the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:38.860 
Marcus might be much better even the

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.280 
Marcus might be much better even the
electronics<00:00:39.370> market<00:00:39.790> could<00:00:40.059> be<00:00:40.270> huge<00:00:40.719> the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:41.290 
electronics market could be huge the

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.959 
electronics market could be huge the
question<00:00:41.710> is<00:00:41.860> will<00:00:42.100> the<00:00:42.190> makers<00:00:42.550> be<00:00:42.700> willing

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
question is will the makers be willing

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:44.970 
question is will the makers be willing
to<00:00:43.059> go<00:00:43.210> down<00:00:43.390> a<00:00:43.629> new<00:00:43.780> road<00:00:43.809> with<00:00:44.260> liquidoff<00:00:44.649> and

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
to go down a new road with liquidoff and

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.680 
to go down a new road with liquidoff and
will<00:00:45.129> that<00:00:45.280> be<00:00:45.430> enough<00:00:45.460> to<00:00:45.789> sway<00:00:46.000> mark<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.570> make

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
will that be enough to sway mark to make

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.139 
will that be enough to sway mark to make
an<00:00:46.809> investment<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:48.430> focus<00:00:48.640> group<00:00:48.760> thought

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
an investment the focus group thought

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.240 
an investment the focus group thought
the<00:00:49.180> public<00:00:49.690> box<00:00:49.870> work<00:00:50.140> was<00:00:50.440> a<00:00:50.469> one-trick<00:00:50.980> pony

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:51.250 
the public box work was a one-trick pony

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.549 
the public box work was a one-trick pony
it<00:00:51.520> can<00:00:51.640> only<00:00:51.789> go<00:00:52.090> up<00:00:52.120> and<00:00:52.629> down<00:00:52.840> what<00:00:53.440> do<00:00:53.500> you

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
it can only go up and down what do you

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:54.600 
it can only go up and down what do you
feel<00:00:53.710> about<00:00:53.739> this<00:00:53.980> part<00:00:54.219> but<00:00:54.370> think<00:00:54.520> it's

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
feel about this part but think it's

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:57.330 
feel about this part but think it's
really<00:00:54.969> cool<00:00:55.420> toy<00:00:55.719> the<00:00:56.320> greatest<00:00:56.710> limitation

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
really cool toy the greatest limitation

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.400 
really cool toy the greatest limitation
is<00:00:57.489> we<00:00:57.610> have<00:00:57.789> only<00:00:58.030> one<00:00:58.480> electrode<00:00:58.989> we're

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
is we have only one electrode we're

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.260 
is we have only one electrode we're

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
the more lecture to have the more

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.130 
the more lecture to have the more
opportunities<00:01:27.759> you<00:01:28.360> have<00:01:28.390> to<00:01:28.630> leverage<00:01:28.840> those

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
opportunities you have to leverage those

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.350 
opportunities you have to leverage those
signals<00:01:29.530> so<00:01:30.070> yeah<00:01:30.189> an<00:01:30.340> electrode<00:01:30.880> not<00:01:31.090> in<00:01:31.240> your

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
signals so yeah an electrode not in your

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.960 
signals so yeah an electrode not in your
frontal<00:01:31.720> cortex<00:01:32.110> but<00:01:32.229> around<00:01:32.950> here<00:01:33.100> you<00:01:33.549> could

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
frontal cortex but around here you could

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.719 
frontal cortex but around here you could
possibly<00:01:34.540> drive<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.590> helicopter<00:01:36.430> of<00:01:36.520> this

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
possibly drive a helicopter of this

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.789 
possibly drive a helicopter of this
alright<00:01:37.329> that's<00:01:37.720> been<00:01:38.020> done<00:01:38.170> in<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.470> research

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:38.799 
alright that's been done in the research

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:40.950 
alright that's been done in the research
like<00:01:39.130> a<00:01:39.340> 3d<00:01:39.790> virtual<00:01:40.030> helicopter<00:01:40.689> it<00:01:40.840> goes

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
like a 3d virtual helicopter it goes
