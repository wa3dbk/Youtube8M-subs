having the freshest bite in the swim yep
although<00:03:59.750> I<00:03:59.780> know<00:03:59.930> Ally<00:04:00.140> uses<00:04:00.530> it<00:04:00.650> you<00:04:00.799> know

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:00.920 
although I know Ally uses it you know

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.380 
although I know Ally uses it you know
you<00:04:00.980> leave<00:04:01.370> it<00:04:01.489> sweating<00:04:01.820> in<00:04:01.910> the<00:04:01.970> bag<00:04:02.120> and

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
you leave it sweating in the bag and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:03.550 
you leave it sweating in the bag and
these<00:04:02.480> things<00:04:02.660> that<00:04:02.780> sugar<00:04:03.049> is<00:04:03.140> coming<00:04:03.380> out<00:04:03.470> of

these things that sugar is coming out of

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.300 
these things that sugar is coming out of

it might get better

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.729 
it might get better
yeah<00:04:04.579> so<00:04:04.970> it's<00:04:05.959> personal<00:04:06.140> preference<00:04:06.500> the

00:04:06.729 --> 00:04:06.739 
yeah so it's personal preference the

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:09.699
