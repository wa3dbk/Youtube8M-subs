you're going to get lots of volume and

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.070 
you're going to get lots of volume and
then<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.790> it<00:01:14.820> come<00:01:15.119> down<00:01:15.299> nice<00:01:15.540> and<00:01:15.600> smooth

into the back here and you can use your
brush<00:01:18.290> almost<00:01:19.580> pinching<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.729> hair<00:01:20.909> like<00:01:21.150> this

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
get a little bit of root lift through it

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.289 
get a little bit of root lift through it
I'm<00:01:32.009> now<00:01:32.159> gonna<00:01:32.310> go<00:01:32.549> through<00:01:32.880> with<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> round

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
I'm now gonna go through with the round

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.450 
I'm now gonna go through with the round
brush<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.409> maximum<00:01:34.920> volume<00:01:35.100> out

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
brush to get like the maximum volume out

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.399 
brush to get like the maximum volume out
of<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.700> I'm<00:01:36.030> using<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.450> ceramic<00:01:36.750> one<00:01:37.170> these<00:01:37.380> are

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
of it I'm using a ceramic one these are

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.380 
of it I'm using a ceramic one these are
really<00:01:37.890> good<00:01:38.070> because<00:01:38.369> they<00:01:38.640> hold<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:39.090> heat

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
really good because they hold the heat

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.319 
really good because they hold the heat
in<00:01:39.600> so<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.740> bit<00:01:40.920> like<00:01:41.100> using<00:01:41.909> a<00:01:41.970> roller<00:01:42.210> in

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
in so it's a bit like using a roller in

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.639 
in so it's a bit like using a roller in
your<00:01:42.570> hair<00:01:42.750> at<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.899> same<00:01:43.079> time<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.470> blow

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
your hair at the same time as blow

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.710 
your hair at the same time as blow
drying<00:01:43.950> it<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:44.549> you're<00:01:44.700> gonna<00:01:44.790> really<00:01:45.149> set<00:01:45.540> the

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
drying it so you're gonna really set the

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.780 
drying it so you're gonna really set the
root<00:01:45.899> and<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.229> loads<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.829> volume<00:01:46.920> out<00:01:47.250> of<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.549> a

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
root and get loads of volume out of it a

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.069 
root and get loads of volume out of it a
good<00:01:48.119> tip<00:01:48.299> when<00:01:48.329> you're<00:01:48.540> doing<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.840> on<00:01:49.020> your

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
good tip when you're doing this on your

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.389 
good tip when you're doing this on your
own<00:01:49.350> hair<00:01:49.619> if<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.829> find<00:01:50.070> that<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.369> too

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
own hair if you find that it's too

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.149 
own hair if you find that it's too
difficult<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.689> actually<00:01:52.320> get<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:52.920> brush

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
difficult to actually get the the brush

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.179 
difficult to actually get the the brush
and<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> very<00:01:53.820> dry<00:01:54.030> working<00:01:54.570> if<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.189> wrap

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
and the very dry working if you wrap

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.359 
and the very dry working if you wrap
your<00:01:56.399> hair<00:01:56.640> around<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:57.420> brush<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:58.140> then<00:01:58.829> just

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
your hair around the brush and then just

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.160 
your hair around the brush and then just
keep<00:01:59.579> heating<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.210> around<00:02:00.600> there<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.049> you're

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
keep heating it around there so you're

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.859 
keep heating it around there so you're
gonna<00:02:01.290> set<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.340> hair<00:02:02.520> around<00:02:02.729> the<00:02:03.329> brush<00:02:03.540> so

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
gonna set the hair around the brush so

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.209 
gonna set the hair around the brush so
you're<00:02:03.990> gonna<00:02:04.110> get<00:02:04.320> a<00:02:04.380> nice<00:02:04.710> bit<00:02:04.950> of<00:02:05.040> volume

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
you're gonna get a nice bit of volume

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.130 
you're gonna get a nice bit of volume
from<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.670> and<00:02:05.850> it's<00:02:05.939> not<00:02:06.119> quite<00:02:06.329> as<00:02:06.570> tricky<00:02:06.960> to

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
from it and it's not quite as tricky to

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.650 
from it and it's not quite as tricky to
move<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.890> all<00:02:08.009> around<00:02:08.250> if<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.910> do<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.509> bit

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
move it all around if you do have a bit

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.660 
move it all around if you do have a bit
of<00:02:09.690> an<00:02:09.869> undercut<00:02:10.319> like<00:02:10.709> Renae<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.250> can<00:02:11.430> just
