00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
great of a game it was really repetitive

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
don't you killed some more zombies you

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.770 
don't you killed some more zombies you
left<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.340> island<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.879> then<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.180> just<00:01:00.359> rinsed

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
left the island and then you just rinsed

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.200 
left the island and then you just rinsed
and<00:01:00.870> repeated<00:01:00.960> all<00:01:01.530> over<00:01:01.949> again<00:01:02.550> so<00:01:02.879> with<00:01:03.030> that

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
and repeated all over again so with that

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:05.299 
and repeated all over again so with that
being<00:01:03.420> said<00:01:03.539> let's<00:01:04.199> go<00:01:04.409> ahead<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.680> talk<00:01:05.100> about

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
being said let's go ahead and talk about

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.260 
being said let's go ahead and talk about
dead<00:01:05.790> island<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.369> second<00:01:08.369> of<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.880> series

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
dead island to the second of the series

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.750 
dead island to the second of the series
so<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:10.320> original<00:01:10.439> opinion<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.369> was<00:01:11.580> this

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
so my original opinion on this was this

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.120 
so my original opinion on this was this
game<00:01:11.970> looks<00:01:12.210> kind<00:01:12.570> of<00:01:12.630> repetitive<00:01:12.960> again<00:01:13.650> but

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
game looks kind of repetitive again but

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.039 
game looks kind of repetitive again but
there<00:01:14.790> was<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.939> couple<00:01:15.180> things<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.630> here<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.869> I

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
there was a couple things on here that I

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.960 
there was a couple things on here that I
was<00:01:16.320> looking<00:01:16.650> forward<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.159> we're<00:01:17.520> not<00:01:17.700> on

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
was looking forward to that we're not on

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.510 
was looking forward to that we're not on
their<00:01:18.210> original<00:01:18.600> dead<00:01:18.810> island<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.979> game<00:01:20.189> was

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
their original dead island the game was

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.499 
their original dead island the game was
visually<00:01:21.030> very<00:01:21.479> very<00:01:22.080> great<00:01:22.729> the<00:01:23.729> game<00:01:24.000> looked

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
visually very very great the game looked

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.870 
visually very very great the game looked
like<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.990> also<00:01:25.290> had<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.470> comedic<00:01:25.920> value<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.729> it

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
like it also had a comedic value in it

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.149 
like it also had a comedic value in it
which<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:27.420> mean<00:01:27.780> if<00:01:27.960> you're<00:01:28.110> killing<00:01:28.439> zombies<00:01:28.920> I

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
which I mean if you're killing zombies I

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.460 
which I mean if you're killing zombies I
guess<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.240> kinda<00:01:30.570> need<00:01:30.689> that<00:01:30.869> refreshing

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
guess you kinda need that refreshing

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.080 
guess you kinda need that refreshing
feel<00:01:31.710> that<00:01:31.920> you<00:01:32.070> know<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.670> could<00:01:32.850> take<00:01:33.030> it

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
feel that you know you could take it

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.450 
feel that you know you could take it
less<00:01:33.479> serious<00:01:34.049> than<00:01:34.079> an<00:01:34.560> actual<00:01:34.740> call<00:01:35.189> duty

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
less serious than an actual call duty

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.069 
less serious than an actual call duty
zombies<00:01:36.000> game<00:01:36.299> or<00:01:36.509> something<00:01:36.780> along<00:01:36.869> those

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
lines but you know in a middle of the

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.230 
lines but you know in a middle of the
game<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.439> you're<00:01:41.159> trying<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.610> kill<00:01:41.970> the

definitely<00:03:25.850> more<00:03:26.239> realistic<00:03:27.019> than<00:03:27.049> what<00:03:27.410> it

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
definitely more realistic than what it

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.920 
definitely more realistic than what it
was<00:03:27.590> previously<00:03:28.280> the<00:03:28.700> weapons<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.810> they

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
was previously the weapons that they

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.840 
was previously the weapons that they
showed<00:03:30.170> in<00:03:30.319> here<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.950> they<00:03:31.430> could<00:03:31.670> be<00:03:31.819> a

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
showed in here and they could be a

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.129 
showed in here and they could be a
little<00:03:32.150> bit<00:03:32.269> better<00:03:32.450> but<00:03:32.780> I<00:03:32.900> think<00:03:33.109> that

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
little bit better but I think that

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.080 
little bit better but I think that
they're<00:03:33.410> hiding<00:03:33.799> the<00:03:33.889> weapons<00:03:34.310> until<00:03:34.549> further

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
they're hiding the weapons until further

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.150 
they're hiding the weapons until further
down<00:03:35.420> the<00:03:35.540> line<00:03:35.660> in<00:03:35.900> the<00:03:36.079> game<00:03:36.410> they

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
down the line in the game they

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.890 
down the line in the game they
definitely<00:03:37.459> show<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:38.030> you<00:03:38.120> have<00:03:38.150> vehicles

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
definitely show that you have vehicles

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.210 
definitely show that you have vehicles
in<00:03:39.049> here<00:03:39.260> so<00:03:39.410> you're<00:03:39.560> gonna<00:03:39.650> have<00:03:39.859> a<00:03:39.920> van<00:03:40.190> that

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
in here so you're gonna have a van that

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.319 
in here so you're gonna have a van that
you're<00:03:40.489> gonna<00:03:40.579> be<00:03:40.790> able<00:03:40.880> to<00:03:41.030> drive<00:03:41.209> around

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:41.329 
you're gonna be able to drive around

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:43.569 
you're gonna be able to drive around
there's<00:03:41.810> no<00:03:42.049> longer<00:03:42.380> just<00:03:42.680> jeeps<00:03:43.160> on<00:03:43.370> here

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
there's no longer just jeeps on here

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.610 
there's no longer just jeeps on here
which<00:03:44.150> is<00:03:44.359> pretty<00:03:44.510> good<00:03:44.630> because<00:03:44.930> I<00:03:45.230> get<00:03:45.410> tired

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
which is pretty good because I get tired

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.440 
which is pretty good because I get tired
of<00:03:45.799> driving<00:03:46.010> the<00:03:46.280> same<00:03:46.519> Jeep<00:03:46.790> over<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.299> over

of driving the same Jeep over and over

overall guys this game I'm gonna go
ahead<00:04:08.690> and<00:04:08.840> rate<00:04:09.109> a<00:04:09.139> nine<00:04:09.290> point<00:04:09.799> five<00:04:10.069> out<00:04:10.340> of

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
one of those games that I'm gonna be

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.650

end<00:04:17.720> like<00:04:18.440> I<00:04:18.530> said<00:04:18.590> I<00:04:18.919> didn't<00:04:19.400> really<00:04:19.910> like<00:04:20.329> the

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.570 
end like I said I didn't really like the

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.270 
end like I said I didn't really like the
original<00:04:20.989> dead<00:04:21.200> island<00:04:21.560> just<00:04:21.799> because<00:04:22.070> I<00:04:22.099> was

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
original dead island just because I was

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.130 
original dead island just because I was
so<00:04:22.430> repetitive<00:04:22.729> but<00:04:23.510> I<00:04:23.539> see<00:04:23.810> that<00:04:23.990> they're

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
so repetitive but I see that they're

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.870 
so repetitive but I see that they're
making<00:04:24.530> progress<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:25.130> they're<00:04:25.250> trying<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.669> do

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
making progress and they're trying to do

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.920 
making progress and they're trying to do
steps<00:04:26.210> away

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:26.930 
steps away

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.170 
steps away
from<00:04:27.110> the<00:04:27.259> same<00:04:27.560> old<00:04:27.830> same<00:04:28.190> old<00:04:28.250> repetitive

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
from the same old same old repetitive

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.909 
from the same old same old repetitive
steps<00:04:29.539> like<00:04:30.110> I<00:04:30.229> said<00:04:30.289> you<00:04:30.500> got<00:04:30.530> on<00:04:30.710> an<00:04:30.770> island

00:04:30.909 --> 00:04:30.919 
steps like I said you got on an island

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:32.620 
steps like I said you got on an island
you<00:04:31.250> left<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.580> island<00:04:31.669> you<00:04:32.000> got<00:04:32.180> on<00:04:32.330> my<00:04:32.479> own

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:34.970 
you left the island in all along the way

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.640 
you left the island in all along the way
you're<00:04:35.570> killing<00:04:35.930> zombies<00:04:36.320> that<00:04:36.410> are<00:04:36.470> in

you're killing zombies that are in
hordes<00:04:36.979> that<00:04:37.160> are<00:04:37.400> so<00:04:37.820> stupid<00:04:38.509> on<00:04:38.870> the<00:04:39.050> game

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
hordes that are so stupid on the game

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:41.050 
hordes that are so stupid on the game
that<00:04:39.770> they<00:04:39.889> would<00:04:40.039> just<00:04:40.190> follow<00:04:40.370> you<00:04:40.669> and<00:04:40.940> you

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
that they would just follow you and you

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.210 
that they would just follow you and you
could<00:04:41.240> use<00:04:41.419> the<00:04:41.570> same<00:04:41.810> pattern<00:04:42.169> 99%<00:04:42.919> of<00:04:43.009> time

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
could use the same pattern 99% of time

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.760 
could use the same pattern 99% of time
and<00:04:43.490> run<00:04:44.030> in<00:04:44.270> circles<00:04:44.660> and<00:04:45.080> circles<00:04:45.320> and<00:04:45.680> they

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:45.770 
and run in circles and circles and they

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:47.980 
and run in circles and circles and they
can<00:04:45.919> never<00:04:46.039> get<00:04:46.340> to<00:04:46.550> you<00:04:46.699> hopefully<00:04:47.570> they<00:04:47.780> saw

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
can never get to you hopefully they saw

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.480 
can never get to you hopefully they saw
that<00:04:48.199> on<00:04:48.350> this<00:04:48.530> game<00:04:48.710> you<00:04:48.860> know<00:04:48.979> it'd<00:04:49.130> be<00:04:49.160> kind
