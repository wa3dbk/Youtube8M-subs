only thing is this a bit chunky when it

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.260 
only thing is this a bit chunky when it
is<00:00:39.719> on<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.350> phone<00:00:40.590> itself<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.550> i'll<00:00:41.910> rather

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
is on the phone itself but i'll rather

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.389 
is on the phone itself but i'll rather
my<00:00:42.570> phone<00:00:42.809> being<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.320> little<00:00:43.500> bit<00:00:43.710> chunky<00:00:44.219> and

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
my phone being a little bit chunky and

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.299 
my phone being a little bit chunky and
at<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> same<00:00:45.239> time<00:00:45.300> it's<00:00:45.840> protected<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.070> let's

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
at the same time it's protected so let's

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.819 
at the same time it's protected so let's
have<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.520> look<00:00:47.760> at<00:00:47.910> this<00:00:48.469> just<00:00:49.469> put<00:00:49.710> the

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
have a look at this just put the

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.660 
have a look at this just put the
packaging<00:00:50.399> away<00:00:51.800> so<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.890> don't<00:00:52.980> really<00:00:53.370> get<00:00:53.610> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
packaging away so you don't really get a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.180 
packaging away so you don't really get a
lot<00:00:53.940> in<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.239> package<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.320> you<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.649> get<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
lot in the package and you just get a

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.360 
lot in the package and you just get a
sticker<00:00:57.090> or<00:00:57.480> relief<00:00:58.440> let<00:00:58.710> showing<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.160> how<00:00:59.340> to

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
in here so again just like the SPG case

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.320 
in here so again just like the SPG case
you<00:01:13.799> also<00:01:13.950> get<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.250> screen<00:01:14.580> protector<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:15.180> your

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
let's put this to the side so this is a

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
let's put this to the side so this is a
dual<00:01:21.299> layer<00:01:21.330> case<00:01:21.900> just<00:01:22.320> like<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.799> SPG<00:01:23.900> slim

case<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.869> meant<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.470> be<00:02:10.500> dust<00:02:10.950> proof<00:02:11.750> scratch

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
case is meant to be dust proof scratch

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.490 
case is meant to be dust proof scratch
resistance

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
resistance

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.550 
resistance
so<00:02:14.100> it<00:02:14.190> doesn't<00:02:14.460> get<00:02:14.550> scratched<00:02:15.020> at<00:02:16.020> the<00:02:16.080> top

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
so it doesn't get scratched at the top

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.970 
so it doesn't get scratched at the top
here<00:02:16.800> you<00:02:16.860> can<00:02:17.220> see<00:02:17.550> where<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:19.500> headphone

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
here you can see where the headphone

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.410 
here you can see where the headphone
goes<00:02:20.400> it's<00:02:20.790> actually<00:02:21.270> see<00:02:21.960> if<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.140> can<00:02:22.320> focus

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
goes it's actually see if I can focus

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.870 
goes it's actually see if I can focus
right<00:02:24.420> there<00:02:24.750> it's<00:02:25.740> actually<00:02:25.890> sealed<00:02:26.460> up<00:02:26.700> so

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
right there it's actually sealed up so

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.820 
right there it's actually sealed up so
you'd<00:02:27.000> have<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.360> open<00:02:27.870> up<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.230> get<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.740> the

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
you'd have to open up to get to the

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.760 
you'd have to open up to get to the
headphones<00:02:29.750> so<00:02:30.750> that's<00:02:30.959> pretty<00:02:31.260> cool<00:02:31.380> you

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
headphones so that's pretty cool you

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.790 
headphones so that's pretty cool you
don't<00:02:31.920> get<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.220> on<00:02:32.520> the<00:02:32.700> SPG<00:02:33.330> case<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:34.050> also

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
don't get that on the SPG case and also

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.620 
don't get that on the SPG case and also
at<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.160> bottom<00:02:35.520> where<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.730> charger<00:02:36.000> goes<00:02:36.390> as

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
at the bottom where the charger goes as

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.440 
at the bottom where the charger goes as
well<00:02:36.980> you'd<00:02:37.980> have<00:02:38.070> to<00:02:38.220> flip<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:39.120> little

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
well you'd have to flip that little

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.380 
well you'd have to flip that little
thing<00:02:39.750> open<00:02:40.320> for<00:02:40.560> you<00:02:40.650> to<00:02:40.680> get<00:02:41.010> there<00:02:41.340> as<00:02:42.209> you

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
thing open for you to get there as you

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.020 
thing open for you to get there as you
can<00:02:42.540> see<00:02:42.840> there<00:02:43.140> so<00:02:44.010> it's<00:02:44.160> pretty<00:02:44.310> solid<00:02:44.610> it<00:02:44.850> is

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
can see there so it's pretty solid it is

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.550 
can see there so it's pretty solid it is
meant<00:02:45.300> to<00:02:45.420> be<00:02:45.450> dust<00:02:45.810> proof<00:02:46.110> so<00:02:46.230> I'm<00:02:46.320> guessing

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
meant to be dust proof so I'm guessing

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.120 
meant to be dust proof so I'm guessing
that's<00:02:47.400> why<00:02:47.900> you<00:02:48.900> have<00:02:49.050> those<00:02:49.290> little<00:02:49.410> slot<00:02:49.920> so

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
that's why you have those little slot so

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.800 
that's why you have those little slot so
it's<00:02:50.250> a<00:02:50.310> very<00:02:50.340> good<00:02:50.790> case<00:02:51.000> very<00:02:51.360> solid<00:02:51.780> very

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
it's a very good case very solid very

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.060 
it's a very good case very solid very
nice<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.770> very<00:02:53.270> protective<00:02:54.590> so<00:02:55.590> at<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.860> back

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
nice and very protective so at the back

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.100 
nice and very protective so at the back
you<00:02:56.280> have<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.580> camera<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.030> LED<00:02:57.209> slot<00:02:57.840> there

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
you have the camera and LED slot there

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.949 
you have the camera and LED slot there
and<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.530> speaker<00:02:58.860> slot<00:02:59.100> at<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.220> bottom<00:02:59.310> and

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
and the speaker slot at the bottom and

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.210 
and the speaker slot at the bottom and
not<00:03:00.959> only<00:03:01.110> if<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.440> can<00:03:01.620> see<00:03:01.890> what<00:03:02.100> it<00:03:02.190> says

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
not only if you can see what it says

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.290 
not only if you can see what it says
auto<00:03:02.670> box<00:03:03.030> right<00:03:03.360> there<00:03:04.580> the<00:03:05.580> buttons<00:03:05.970> are

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
auto box right there the buttons are

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:10.360 
auto box right there the buttons are
pretty<00:03:06.630> responsive<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.680> well<00:03:08.810> volume<00:03:09.810> key

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
pretty responsive as well volume key

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.180 
pretty responsive as well volume key
pretty<00:03:11.370> responsive<00:03:13.790> let's<00:03:14.790> see<00:03:16.100> it<00:03:17.100> was

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
pretty responsive let's see it was

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.170 
pretty responsive let's see it was
pretty<00:03:17.400> responsive<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.620> let's<00:03:20.489> take<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.790> look

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
pretty responsive so let's take a look

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.050 
pretty responsive so let's take a look
at<00:03:21.360> how<00:03:21.570> this<00:03:21.870> phone<00:03:22.230> is<00:03:22.590> when<00:03:22.890> it<00:03:23.130> drops<00:03:23.489> face

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
at how this phone is when it drops face

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.250 
at how this phone is when it drops face
down<00:03:24.950> the<00:03:25.950> SPG<00:03:26.549> case<00:03:26.820> again<00:03:27.269> is<00:03:27.450> quite<00:03:27.720> solid

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
down the SPG case again is quite solid

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.440 
down the SPG case again is quite solid
I've<00:03:28.500> done<00:03:28.680> in<00:03:29.010> my<00:03:29.250> video<00:03:29.730> I<00:03:29.790> showed<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.180> guys

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
I've done in my video I showed you guys

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.670 
I've done in my video I showed you guys
that<00:03:30.720> you<00:03:30.810> can<00:03:30.840> actually<00:03:31.080> drop<00:03:31.350> the<00:03:31.500> phone

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
that you can actually drop the phone

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.890 
that you can actually drop the phone
facedown<00:03:32.040> with<00:03:32.400> no<00:03:32.760> problem<00:03:33.269> so<00:03:33.450> let's<00:03:33.690> take<00:03:33.840> a

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
facedown with no problem so let's take a

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900 
facedown with no problem so let's take a
look<00:03:34.170> at<00:03:34.290> how<00:03:34.410> this<00:03:34.620> one<00:03:34.830> holds<00:03:34.980> up<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.730> edges

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
look at how this one holds up the edges

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.530 
look at how this one holds up the edges
all<00:03:36.299> quite<00:03:36.630> thick<00:03:36.930> as<00:03:37.110> well<00:03:37.290> like<00:03:37.530> this<00:03:38.040> one<00:03:38.540> is

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
all quite thick as well like this one is

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.229 
all quite thick as well like this one is
quite<00:03:39.750> thick<00:03:40.140> so<00:03:41.130> let's<00:03:41.340> see<00:03:41.519> how<00:03:41.549> it<00:03:41.790> holds<00:03:41.940> up

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
quite thick so let's see how it holds up

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:45.890 
quite thick so let's see how it holds up
so<00:03:42.480> I'll<00:03:42.600> drop<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.989> from<00:03:43.110> around<00:03:43.410> there<00:03:44.900> you

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
so I'll drop it from around there you

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.539 
so I'll drop it from around there you
can<00:03:46.079> hear<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.440> rubble<00:03:46.769> when<00:03:46.890> it<00:03:47.040> drops<00:03:47.340> as

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
can hear the rubble when it drops as

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.650 
can hear the rubble when it drops as
well<00:03:49.370> it's<00:03:50.370> no<00:03:50.519> problem<00:03:50.910> sitting<00:03:51.120> the<00:03:51.299> edges

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
well it's no problem sitting the edges

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:54.560 
well it's no problem sitting the edges
so<00:03:51.870> very<00:03:52.739> good<00:03:53.010> case<00:03:53.340> it's<00:03:53.790> very<00:03:54.000> protective

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
so very good case it's very protective

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.470 
so very good case it's very protective
just<00:03:54.780> like<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.079> SPG<00:03:55.680> case<00:03:56.180> so<00:03:57.180> if<00:03:57.360> you're

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
just like the SPG case so if you're

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.210 
just like the SPG case so if you're
thinking<00:03:57.630> about<00:03:57.930> buying<00:03:58.320> this<00:03:58.620> one<00:03:58.680> or<00:03:59.100> the

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
thinking about buying this one or the

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.120 
thinking about buying this one or the
SPG<00:04:00.209> one<00:04:00.450> they're<00:04:01.410> pretty<00:04:01.590> much<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.950> same

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
SPG one they're pretty much the same

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:03.949 
SPG one they're pretty much the same
things<00:04:02.489> just<00:04:02.760> that<00:04:02.910> this<00:04:03.120> one<00:04:03.390> again<00:04:03.510> is<00:04:03.720> just

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
things just that this one again is just

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.620 
things just that this one again is just
it<00:04:04.380> looks<00:04:04.620> a<00:04:04.739> little<00:04:04.890> bit<00:04:05.130> and<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:06.239> comes<00:04:06.480> in

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
it looks a little bit and it comes in

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.240 
it looks a little bit and it comes in
loads<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:06.989> different<00:04:07.200> colors<00:04:07.680> I've<00:04:07.829> only<00:04:07.980> seen

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
loads of different colors I've only seen

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.360 
loads of different colors I've only seen
a<00:04:08.310> black<00:04:08.579> one<00:04:08.820> to<00:04:09.120> this<00:04:09.239> one<00:04:09.299> so<00:04:09.720> far<00:04:10.100> but<00:04:11.100> yeah
