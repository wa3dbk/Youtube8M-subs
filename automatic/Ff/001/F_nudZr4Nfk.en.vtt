these<00:04:15.890> colors<00:04:16.100> are<00:04:16.340> very<00:04:16.519> buildable<00:04:17.560> we<00:04:18.560> can

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
these colors are very buildable we can

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:24.640 
these colors are very buildable we can
make<00:04:18.919> them<00:04:19.070> like<00:04:19.280> very<00:04:20.209> here<00:04:22.510> and<00:04:23.510> we<00:04:23.750> just<00:04:24.199> wet
