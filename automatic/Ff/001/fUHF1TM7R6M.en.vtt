00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.749 
bought at 38 1 million so I bought at 38
1<00:01:57.869> million<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.469> now<00:01:58.619> I<00:01:58.649> pretty<00:01:59.100> much<00:01:59.219> sold<00:01:59.579> it

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
1 million and now I pretty much sold it

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.050 
1 million and now I pretty much sold it
and<00:01:59.939> I<00:02:00.540> made<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.840> bell<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.530> these<00:02:02.340> four<00:02:02.579> items<00:02:02.610> I

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
and I made a bell on these four items I

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.840 
and I made a bell on these four items I
just<00:02:03.299> flipped<00:02:03.509> I<00:02:03.780> think<00:02:04.290> I<00:02:04.380> made<00:02:04.670> 67<00:02:05.670> million

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
just flipped I think I made 67 million

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.240 
just flipped I think I made 67 million
so<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.780> not<00:02:06.869> that<00:02:06.930> bad<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.530> this<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.129> pretty

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
that much or at a speed pretty much so

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.690 
that much or at a speed pretty much so
you<00:02:33.690> might<00:02:33.930> want<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.110> try<00:02:34.260> higher<00:02:34.770> values<00:02:35.490> if

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
you might want to try higher values if

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.800 
you might want to try higher values if
they<00:02:35.880> don't<00:02:36.090> buy<00:02:36.270> but<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:36.990> really<00:02:37.260> up<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.530> you

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
they don't buy but it's really up to you

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.120 
they don't buy but it's really up to you
when<00:02:39.810> it<00:02:39.930> comes<00:02:40.140> to<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.410> black<00:02:40.590> center<00:02:40.950> head

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
when it comes to the black center head

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.160 
when it comes to the black center head
you<00:02:41.580> shouldn't<00:02:42.000> feel<00:02:42.030> ashamed<00:02:42.270> if<00:02:42.870> you're

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
you shouldn't feel ashamed if you're

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.530 
you shouldn't feel ashamed if you're
looking<00:02:43.500> at<00:02:43.590> less<00:02:43.800> profit<00:02:44.280> even<00:02:45.180> if<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.360> make

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
looking at less profit even if you make

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.840 
looking at less profit even if you make
one<00:02:45.570> or<00:02:45.930> two<00:02:46.230> million<00:02:46.650> on<00:02:46.920> each<00:02:47.280> black<00:02:47.550> center

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
one or two million on each black center

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.800 
one or two million on each black center
head<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.180> is<00:02:48.300> still<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.960> lot<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.380> money<00:02:49.410> so

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
head that is still a lot of money so

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.870 
head that is still a lot of money so
sometimes<00:02:51.810> you<00:02:52.140> got<00:02:52.260> to<00:02:52.350> cut<00:02:52.530> your<00:02:52.770> losses<00:02:52.980> you

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
sometimes you got to cut your losses you

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.370 
sometimes you got to cut your losses you
got<00:02:54.030> a<00:02:54.060> self<00:02:54.360> the<00:02:54.510> price<00:02:54.690> you<00:02:54.870> bought<00:02:54.900> that<00:02:55.080> if

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
got a self the price you bought that if

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.620 
got a self the price you bought that if
it<00:02:55.470> doesn't<00:02:55.770> sell<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.400> half<00:02:56.670> an<00:02:56.790> hour<00:02:56.910> but

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
it doesn't sell in half an hour but

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:58.880 
it doesn't sell in half an hour but
you've<00:02:57.750> really<00:02:57.930> got<00:02:58.050> to<00:02:58.080> try<00:02:58.290> your<00:02:58.440> hardest<00:02:58.590> to

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
you've really got to try your hardest to

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.280 
you've really got to try your hardest to
not<00:02:58.980> lose<00:02:59.400> money<00:02:59.670> now<00:03:00.300> I<00:03:00.330> know<00:03:00.420> how<00:03:00.660> easy<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.170> is

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
not lose money now I know how easy it is

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.950 
not lose money now I know how easy it is
to<00:03:01.350> actually<00:03:01.650> lose<00:03:02.430> money<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:02.850> flipping<00:03:03.360> so

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960 
to actually lose money on flipping so

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.890 
to actually lose money on flipping so
all<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.230> got<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.500> do<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:04.740> be<00:03:04.980> patient<00:03:05.520> now

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
all you got to do is just be patient now

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.570 
all you got to do is just be patient now
in<00:03:06.900> case<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.320> starts<00:03:07.350> to<00:03:07.680> drop<00:03:07.890> you<00:03:08.100> might<00:03:08.370> want

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
in case it starts to drop you might want

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.100 
in case it starts to drop you might want
to<00:03:08.730> sell<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:08.940> for<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.360> price<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.570> bought<00:03:09.720> at

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
to sell it for the price you bought at

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.040 
to sell it for the price you bought at
but<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.340> can<00:03:11.490> always<00:03:11.730> just<00:03:12.120> wait<00:03:12.780> because

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
but you can always just wait because

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.350 
but you can always just wait because
prices<00:03:13.440> go<00:03:13.710> up<00:03:13.740> and<00:03:14.010> down<00:03:14.160> especially<00:03:14.820> with

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
prices go up and down especially with

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.810 
prices go up and down especially with
these<00:03:15.510> items<00:03:15.780> they<00:03:16.590> go<00:03:16.740> up<00:03:16.920> five<00:03:17.190> million<00:03:17.430> and

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
these items they go up five million and

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.020 
these items they go up five million and
go<00:03:17.940> down<00:03:18.120> five<00:03:18.360> million<00:03:18.620> very<00:03:19.620> very<00:03:19.950> often<00:03:20.430> so

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
go down five million very very often so

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.490 
go down five million very very often so
you<00:03:21.060> might<00:03:21.540> want<00:03:21.720> to<00:03:21.780> wait<00:03:21.960> until<00:03:22.170> they<00:03:22.380> go

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
you might want to wait until they go

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.980 
you might want to wait until they go
down<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:23.040> flip<00:03:23.250> them<00:03:23.460> and<00:03:23.640> then<00:03:24.510> there's

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:24.990 
down to flip them and then there's

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.200 
down to flip them and then there's
higher<00:03:25.230> chances<00:03:25.740> of<00:03:25.890> them<00:03:26.070> going<00:03:26.400> up<00:03:26.700> so<00:03:27.150> you

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
higher chances of them going up so you

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.480 
higher chances of them going up so you
will<00:03:27.480> have<00:03:27.560> easier<00:03:28.560> flips<00:03:28.890> and<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.310> have

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:29.490 
will have easier flips and you have

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:30.860 
will have easier flips and you have
higher<00:03:29.700> chances<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:30.180> actually<00:03:30.270> making<00:03:30.570> money

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
higher chances of actually making money

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.770 
higher chances of actually making money
I<00:03:31.170> know<00:03:32.100> it's<00:03:32.460> not<00:03:32.550> an<00:03:32.670> easy<00:03:32.940> topic<00:03:33.510> to

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
I know it's not an easy topic to

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.330 
I know it's not an easy topic to
actually<00:03:34.020> talk<00:03:34.170> about<00:03:34.320> especially<00:03:34.770> if

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
actually talk about especially if
