any kind we as butternut squash seeds
the<00:00:37.040> first<00:00:37.340> time<00:00:37.640> and<00:00:37.910> I<00:00:38.840> really<00:00:39.380> take<00:00:39.620> two

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
the first time and I really take two

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.639 
the first time and I really take two
seeds<00:00:40.190> for<00:00:40.489> some<00:00:40.670> reason<00:00:41.090> I<00:00:41.300> just<00:00:41.390> they<00:00:42.289> really

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
seeds for some reason I just they really

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.360 
seeds for some reason I just they really
mesh<00:00:43.579> with<00:00:43.609> my<00:00:44.000> body<00:00:44.239> and<00:00:44.739> anytime<00:00:45.739> you<00:00:45.949> sprout

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
mesh with my body and anytime you sprout

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.110 
mesh with my body and anytime you sprout
seeds<00:00:46.670> as<00:00:46.910> you<00:00:47.089> know<00:00:47.300> you<00:00:48.429> open<00:00:49.429> them<00:00:49.579> up<00:00:49.730> for

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
seeds as you know you open them up for

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.779 
seeds as you know you open them up for
sprouting<00:00:50.660> and<00:00:51.140> it<00:00:51.500> increases<00:00:51.980> the<00:00:52.190> nutrients

00:00:52.779 --> 00:00:52.789 
sprouting and it increases the nutrients

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.700 
sprouting and it increases the nutrients
for<00:00:52.910> your<00:00:53.059> body<00:00:53.410> exponentially<00:00:54.410> so<00:00:54.589> you

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
for your body exponentially so you

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.799 
for your body exponentially so you
always<00:00:55.219> want<00:00:55.429> to<00:00:55.699> sprout<00:00:56.089> your<00:00:56.300> seeds<00:00:56.570> and

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
always want to sprout your seeds and

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.840 
always want to sprout your seeds and
nuts<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.230> then<00:00:57.859> we're<00:00:58.010> going<00:00:58.160> to<00:00:58.280> put<00:00:58.429> some

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
nuts and then we're going to put some

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.970 
nuts and then we're going to put some
things<00:00:59.059> on<00:00:59.329> them<00:00:59.629> and<00:00:59.839> dehydrate<00:01:00.649> and

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:00.980 
things on them and dehydrate and

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.649 
things on them and dehydrate and
dehydrate<00:01:01.699> them<00:01:01.879> to<00:01:02.059> make<00:01:02.210> them<00:01:02.390> even<00:01:02.539> more

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:02.659 
dehydrate them to make them even more

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:05.500 
dehydrate them to make them even more
taste<00:01:03.309> so<00:01:04.309> first<00:01:04.580> you<00:01:04.730> want<00:01:04.909> to<00:01:05.000> soak<00:01:05.239> them

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
taste so first you want to soak them

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.570 
taste so first you want to soak them
these<00:01:06.290> are<00:01:06.350> actually<00:01:06.830> wheat<00:01:07.010> grass<00:01:07.250> seeds

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
these are actually wheat grass seeds

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.250 
these are actually wheat grass seeds
here<00:01:07.820> but<00:01:08.000> you<00:01:08.150> do<00:01:08.300> the<00:01:08.450> same<00:01:08.659> thing<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:09.050> put

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
here but you do the same thing you put

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.520 
here but you do the same thing you put
the<00:01:09.409> seeds<00:01:09.680> in<00:01:09.890> water<00:01:10.300> and<00:01:11.300> since<00:01:11.659> a<00:01:11.900> lot<00:01:12.500> of

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
the seeds in water and since a lot of

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.580 
the seeds in water and since a lot of
the<00:01:12.680> seeds<00:01:13.090> so<00:01:14.090> can<00:01:14.450> sprout<00:01:14.720> at<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.049> same<00:01:15.320> time

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
the seeds so can sprout at the same time

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.550 
the seeds so can sprout at the same time
you<00:01:15.890> can<00:01:16.100> do<00:01:16.280> it<00:01:16.460> all<00:01:16.880> together<00:01:17.689> so<00:01:18.170> i<00:01:18.200> took<00:01:18.380> the

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
you can do it all together so i took the

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.710 
you can do it all together so i took the
sunflower<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.520> pumpkin<00:01:19.579> seeds<00:01:20.000> all<00:01:20.509> together

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
sunflower and pumpkin seeds all together

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.160 
sunflower and pumpkin seeds all together
in<00:01:21.110> a<00:01:21.200> bag<00:01:21.490> like<00:01:22.490> this<00:01:22.600> sprouting<00:01:23.600> back<00:01:23.840> and

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
in a bag like this sprouting back and

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.499

then<00:01:24.710> I<00:01:24.799> filled<00:01:25.070> my<00:01:25.219> bowl<00:01:25.579> with<00:01:25.820> water<00:01:25.850> and

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:26.509 
then I filled my bowl with water and

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.469 
then I filled my bowl with water and
just<00:01:26.750> SAT<00:01:27.020> it<00:01:27.200> in<00:01:27.350> there<00:01:27.619> and<00:01:27.939> you<00:01:28.939> sit<00:01:29.240> it<00:01:29.360> in

there for 8 to 14 hours Bob just one day

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:35.260 
there for 8 to 14 hours Bob just one day
is<00:01:33.560> fine<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.130> then<00:01:34.340> you<00:01:34.460> dump<00:01:34.729> out<00:01:34.909> the<00:01:34.939> water

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
is fine and then you dump out the water

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.319 
is fine and then you dump out the water
and<00:01:35.719> just<00:01:36.020> let<00:01:36.320> it<00:01:36.350> dry<00:01:36.799> in<00:01:37.039> there<00:01:37.250> now<00:01:37.789> pumpkin

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
and just let it dry in there now pumpkin

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.990 
and just let it dry in there now pumpkin
seeds<00:01:38.659> in<00:01:38.960> particular<00:01:39.680> have<00:01:40.399> a<00:01:42.969> tendency<00:01:43.969> to

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
seeds in particular have a tendency to

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.899 
seeds in particular have a tendency to
mold<00:01:44.899> they<00:01:45.439> say<00:01:45.710> or<00:01:45.979> grow<00:01:46.159> bacteria<00:01:46.399> I've

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
mold they say or grow bacteria I've

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.429 
mold they say or grow bacteria I've
never<00:01:47.149> experienced<00:01:47.840> that<00:01:47.899> but<00:01:48.140> a<00:01:48.200> lot<00:01:48.259> of

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
never experienced that but a lot of

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.380 
never experienced that but a lot of
people<00:01:48.740> seem<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.159> be<00:01:49.369> concerned<00:01:49.820> about<00:01:49.969> that

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
people seem to be concerned about that

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.410 
people seem to be concerned about that
and<00:01:50.750> what<00:01:51.439> I<00:01:51.469> do<00:01:51.649> is<00:01:51.799> spread<00:01:52.270> when<00:01:53.270> they're

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
and what I do is spread when they're

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.060 
and what I do is spread when they're
drawing<00:01:53.750> spread<00:01:54.229> them<00:01:54.380> out<00:01:54.469> on<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.680> tray

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
drawing spread them out on a tray

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.099 
drawing spread them out on a tray
instead<00:01:55.700> of<00:01:55.729> leaving<00:01:56.030> them<00:01:56.329> in<00:01:56.359> the<00:01:56.479> bag<00:01:56.719> all

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:57.109 
instead of leaving them in the bag all

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:59.950 
instead of leaving them in the bag all
day<00:01:57.140> I<00:01:57.619> think<00:01:58.189> the<00:01:58.369> moisture<00:01:58.939> condensed<00:01:59.719> on

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
day I think the moisture condensed on

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.609 
day I think the moisture condensed on
the<00:02:00.170> deep<00:02:00.409> and<00:02:00.619> nuts<00:02:01.539> might<00:02:02.539> lend<00:02:02.750> to<00:02:02.899> bacteria

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
the deep and nuts might lend to bacteria

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.380 
the deep and nuts might lend to bacteria
so<00:02:03.890> but<00:02:04.039> if<00:02:04.130> you<00:02:04.250> then<00:02:04.429> put<00:02:04.939> them<00:02:05.030> out<00:02:05.149> on<00:02:05.179> a

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
so but if you then put them out on a

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:06.920 
so but if you then put them out on a
paper<00:02:05.600> towel<00:02:05.929> or<00:02:06.229> on<00:02:06.350> a<00:02:06.380> plate

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
paper towel or on a plate

salts I think I'm actually just going to
do<00:03:09.720> this<00:03:09.930> since<00:03:10.260> that's<00:03:10.440> what<00:03:10.590> I<00:03:10.650> really<00:03:11.040> do

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
do this since that's what I really do

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.789 
do this since that's what I really do
when<00:03:11.400> I'm<00:03:11.549> making<00:03:11.880> raw<00:03:12.209> foods<00:03:12.560> you<00:03:13.560> want<00:03:13.739> a

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.729 
when I'm making raw foods you want a
pretty<00:03:14.070> lost<00:03:14.340> I'm<00:03:15.090> hesitant<00:03:15.989> about<00:03:16.140> using<00:03:16.590> too

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
pretty lost I'm hesitant about using too

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.289 
pretty lost I'm hesitant about using too
much<00:03:16.860> salt<00:03:17.160> but<00:03:17.400> you<00:03:17.489> want<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.760> pretty<00:03:17.940> lot<00:03:18.150> in

much salt but you want to pretty lot in

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.470

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
this because salty seeds are just really

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.350
