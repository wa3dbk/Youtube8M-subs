classic<00:00:33.629> univibe<00:00:33.989> sound<00:00:34.410> and<00:00:34.649> it<00:00:35.070> uses<00:00:35.220> a<00:00:35.370> lot

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
classic univibe sound and it uses a lot

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.579 
classic univibe sound and it uses a lot
of<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> same<00:00:35.910> components<00:00:36.540> to<00:00:36.750> achieve<00:00:37.350> that

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:37.589 
of the same components to achieve that

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:38.960 
of the same components to achieve that
so<00:00:37.829> let's<00:00:38.190> check<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:38.579> out

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
so let's check it out

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.000 
so let's check it out
really<00:00:39.420> straightforward<00:00:40.079> simple<00:00:40.500> features

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
set you've got an intensity control and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.040 
set you've got an intensity control and
a<00:00:43.379> speed<00:00:43.710> control<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.699> a<00:00:45.089> true<00:00:45.300> bypass<00:00:45.720> switch

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
a speed control and a true bypass switch

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.049 
a speed control and a true bypass switch
and<00:00:46.230> status<00:00:46.620> indicator<00:00:47.040> light<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.489> mean<00:00:47.730> that's

and here's the mic revive engaged let's

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.980 
and here's the mic revive engaged let's
check<00:01:22.590> out<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.860> intensity<00:01:23.280> control<00:01:23.990> okay

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
check out the intensity control okay

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:50.120 
check out the intensity control okay
starting<00:01:25.290> with<00:01:25.410> it<00:01:25.530> all<00:01:25.620> the<00:01:25.710> way<00:01:25.800> down<00:01:49.130> so

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
starting with it all the way down so

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.010 
starting with it all the way down so
really<00:01:50.430> more<00:01:50.670> than<00:01:50.820> just<00:01:50.880> level<00:01:51.390> or<00:01:51.540> intensity

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
really more than just level or intensity

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.440 
really more than just level or intensity
it<00:01:52.290> actually<00:01:52.860> changes<00:01:53.250> like<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.610> shape<00:01:54.270> of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
it actually changes like the shape of

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.820 
it actually changes like the shape of
the<00:01:54.540> vowel<00:01:54.810> sound<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.380> want<00:01:55.500> to<00:01:55.560> personify

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
the vowel sound if you want to personify

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.650 
the vowel sound if you want to personify
it<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.369> you<00:01:56.850> know<00:01:56.970> what<00:01:57.090> I'm<00:01:57.180> saying<00:01:57.420> it's

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
it but you know what I'm saying it's

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:00.350 
it but you know what I'm saying it's
just<00:01:57.720> like<00:01:58.020> it's<00:01:58.200> more<00:01:58.580> it's<00:01:59.580> thicker<00:01:59.940> that's

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
just like it's more it's thicker that's

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.969 
just like it's more it's thicker that's
for<00:02:00.570> sure<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.320> changes<00:02:01.740> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
for sure and it changes the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.770 
for sure and it changes the
pronunciation<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:02.940> that<00:02:03.240> over-pronounce

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
pronunciation and that over-pronounce

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.650 
pronunciation and that over-pronounce
shape<00:02:04.229> in<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.710> highest<00:02:05.130> intensity<00:02:05.660> setting

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
shape in the highest intensity setting

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:07.999 
shape in the highest intensity setting
will<00:02:07.080> really<00:02:07.410> help<00:02:07.590> it<00:02:07.710> cut<00:02:07.890> through

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
will really help it cut through

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.680 
will really help it cut through
distortion<00:02:08.520> better<00:02:08.729> too<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.209> if<00:02:09.390> you've<00:02:09.540> got

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
distortion better too like if you've got

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.660 
distortion better too like if you've got
a<00:02:09.720> lot<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.110> distortion<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.040> checking<00:02:11.459> out<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
a lot of distortion and checking out the

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.340 
a lot of distortion and checking out the
speed<00:02:12.030> control<00:02:12.450> let's<00:02:12.630> get<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.840> intensity

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
speed control let's get the intensity

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:42.490 
speed control let's get the intensity
back<00:02:13.530> down<00:02:13.800> here<00:02:14.010> a<00:02:14.040> little<00:02:14.130> bit<00:02:14.720> start<00:02:15.720> slow

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.750 

so<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:43.560> can<00:02:43.650> see<00:02:43.770> it<00:02:43.860> goes<00:02:44.040> from<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.310> really

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
so you can see it goes from a really

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.630 
so you can see it goes from a really
gentle<00:02:45.090> slow<00:02:45.660> swell<00:02:46.080> to<00:02:46.530> like<00:02:46.740> really<00:02:47.400> fast

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
gentle slow swell to like really fast

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.370 
gentle slow swell to like really fast
almost<00:02:47.880> stutter<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.570> the<00:02:49.080> thing<00:02:49.230> that's

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
almost stutter and the thing that's

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.080 
almost stutter and the thing that's
really<00:02:49.500> nice<00:02:49.710> about<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:50.100> travel<00:02:50.550> of<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.880> knob

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
really nice about the travel of the knob

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.780 
really nice about the travel of the knob
is<00:02:51.510> that<00:02:51.840> there's<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.110> lot<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.800> variation<00:02:53.730> in

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
is that there's a lot of variation in

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.820 
is that there's a lot of variation in
between<00:02:54.150> I<00:02:54.420> mean<00:02:54.450> you<00:02:54.990> know<00:02:55.110> you<00:02:55.170> can<00:02:55.440> kind<00:02:55.770> of

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
between I mean you know you can kind of

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.680 
between I mean you know you can kind of
just<00:02:55.890> get<00:02:56.190> you<00:02:56.700> can<00:02:56.790> get<00:02:56.910> within<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.240> range<00:02:57.450> in

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
just get you can get within the range in

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.480 
just get you can get within the range in
your<00:02:57.810> clothes<00:02:58.080> you<00:02:58.320> don't<00:02:58.470> have<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.710> like<00:02:59.040> nail
