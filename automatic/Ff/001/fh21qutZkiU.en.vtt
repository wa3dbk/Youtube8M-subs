a<00:00:48.600> light<00:00:49.050> colored<00:00:49.730> chain-link<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.020> the<00:00:52.020> dyes

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
a light colored chain-link and the dyes

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.100 
a light colored chain-link and the dyes
in<00:00:52.590> between<00:00:53.090> the<00:00:54.090> two<00:00:54.300> pins<00:00:54.660> on<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.870> chain

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
in between the two pins on the chain

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.939 
in between the two pins on the chain
link<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.610> then<00:00:56.610> I<00:00:56.699> go<00:00:56.850> down<00:00:57.379> and<00:00:58.430> I<00:00:59.430> have<00:01:00.180> a<00:01:00.949> dot

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
link and then I go down and I have a dot

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.359 
link and then I go down and I have a dot
right<00:01:02.250> here<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:04.049> crank<00:01:04.409> timing<00:01:04.890> gear<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
right here on the crank timing gear and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.570 
right here on the crank timing gear and
another<00:01:06.119> shiny<00:01:06.510> link<00:01:08.060> again<00:01:09.060> in<00:01:09.210> between<00:01:10.580> the

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
another shiny link again in between the

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.710 
another shiny link again in between the
two<00:01:11.790> dots<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.330> on<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:13.140> chain<00:01:13.409> I<00:01:14.540> think<00:01:15.540> that's

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
two dots on on the chain I think that's

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.090 
two dots on on the chain I think that's
right<00:01:15.990> so<00:01:16.439> I'm<00:01:16.950> going<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.130> go<00:01:17.280> ahead<00:01:17.520> and<00:01:19.100> put

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
right so I'm going to go ahead and put

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.590 
right so I'm going to go ahead and put

tensioner<00:01:24.600> all<00:01:25.229> of<00:01:25.470> all<00:01:27.439> threw<00:01:28.439> me<00:01:28.590> off<00:01:28.619> though

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
tensioner all of all threw me off though

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.460 
tensioner all of all threw me off though
because<00:01:29.100> I<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.430> timing<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.180> cam<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.960> on

the rear valves are both closed when I

the rear valves are both closed when I

little bit once getting ready to close

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.270 
little bit once getting ready to close
one's<00:01:58.290> getting<00:01:58.500> ready<00:01:58.649> to<00:01:58.710> open<00:01:58.979> but<00:01:59.100> they're

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
both a little bit open these two are

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.780 
both a little bit open these two are
completely<00:02:02.399> closed<00:02:02.969> I<00:02:03.060> got<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:04.790> infamous

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
completely closed I got the infamous

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:08.240 
completely closed I got the infamous
bunny<00:02:06.000> ears<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.450> top<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.899> I'm<00:02:07.140> pretty<00:02:08.039> sure

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
bunny ears to the top so I'm pretty sure

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.669 
bunny ears to the top so I'm pretty sure
it's<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.520> top<00:02:08.700> dead<00:02:08.910> center<00:02:09.179> with<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.450> crank<00:02:09.720> or

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
it's a top dead center with the crank or

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.500 
it's a top dead center with the crank or
the<00:02:10.800> camshaft<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:11.520> got<00:02:11.700> top<00:02:11.970> dead<00:02:12.209> center

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
the camshaft and I got top dead center

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.250 
the camshaft and I got top dead center
on<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.660> crane

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.700 
on the crane
the<00:02:13.740> dowels<00:02:14.130> are<00:02:14.250> up<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.790> I<00:02:15.560> didn't<00:02:16.560> have<00:02:16.650> a

the dowels are up and I didn't have a

the dowels are up and I didn't have a
dial<00:02:16.980> indicator<00:02:17.100> but<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.910> kind<00:02:18.270> of<00:02:18.330> eyeballed

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
dial indicator but I kind of eyeballed

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.770 
dial indicator but I kind of eyeballed
it<00:02:20.120> hopefully<00:02:21.120> I<00:02:21.330> have<00:02:21.600> calibrated<00:02:22.320> eyeballs
