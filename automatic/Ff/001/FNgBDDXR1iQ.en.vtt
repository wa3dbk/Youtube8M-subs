00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.890
 hello dear oracle 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.060
 although it's christmas has rumrich 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.710
 hardly there 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.350
 well, that's why we do today too 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.420
 no sumptuous meal or dessert but 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.519
 a delicious snack namely parmesan 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.660
 biscuits and there is also one 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.369
 small colorful salad 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.980
 the ingredients are quickly together 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.050
 namely need for army was on cheese 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.309
 although others use hard cheese 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.870
 can and the taste is then 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:38.550
 of course, slightly different 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.410
 but the preparation time around stove can 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.600
 it was easy to get here as well 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.950
 chiliflocken if you only 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 certainly you have red you can 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.579
 These also chase through the shredder and 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.930
 then you also have chiliflocken and 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.570
 alternatively, cayenne pepper could also be used 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.100
 take and very important thyme 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.050
 I am in the lucky position which 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.520
 to have on his own but he buys 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.440
 Of course, that's exactly what it's like for me 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.930
 and now you can start the parmesan 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.820
 cheese has to be grated and that 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.320
 relatively coarse i take mine for that 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.030
 months but with a 3d it works the same way 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.400
 now come the spices and that 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.920
 Half a teaspoon of the city ​​flakes 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.009
 and a heaped tablespoon of thyme 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.659
 mix everything together nicely 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.490
 We prepare a baking sheet in front of something 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.990
 lay out with baking paper and take now 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.119
 from our cheese always mix one 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.700
 Tablespoon put this on the tin 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.650
 and gently squeeze the cheese 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.759
 between the individual portions should be about 5 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.439
 centimeters 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.630
 if it is perhaps filled we give 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.340
 the preheated and indeed on second 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.460
 rail from below the temperature should 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.619
 200 degrees with ambient air 180 degrees 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.350
 and after about six to eight minutes 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.020
 our parmesan cheese is ready and 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.060
 look so crispy 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.649
 now the alternative to prepare two 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.810
 years but only works if 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.549
 her a tin for mini muffins for the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.560
 Oil bulls equal share and the cheese 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:56.450
 The individual mills enter into it 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.969
 fill to the top and now again 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.859
 in the hearth in there the thickness of the cheese 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:02.689
 layer here is longer 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.459
 also the time spent in the stove something her 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.049
 are then even about 10 minutes and 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.969
 So that's our previous one 

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.920
 result of work we can do the parmesan 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:11.690
 biscuits are and so rich as a blanket and 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.519
 a type suitable from cranberries or 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.500
 give a ketchup mix or else 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:17.780
 We use them as decoration for one 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.950
 small colorful salad and we want that 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.780
 to prepare quickly now 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.340
 Here are the ingredients for me 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.450
 but you have also decided 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.840
 be very flexible 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:30.680
 So I take lettuce red 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.329
 Chicory and paprika on the field salad 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.610
 distribute the plate and over it 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:37.430
 very simple dressing that is here 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:40.130
 a mixture of balsamic oil and salt 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.190
 Do not pepper more so that special 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.420
 cheese taste just is not drowned 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.069
 Now some of the red chicory 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.739
 leaves still over that make one 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:54.069
 nice color contrast our drazan biscuits 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:54.069
 and write a few more peppers 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:57.739
 finished is an attractive yummy 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.290
 salad 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:02.389
 I think it's a clever idea and we 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.920
 could be prepared very quickly and 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.540
 maybe doing well between them 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.730
 whole christmas feasting a lot 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.540
 fun when I wish preparation 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.100
 you have a beautiful one 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.350
 Christmas party with great gifts 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.730
 but also for pleasure when giving away 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:15.730
 Until next time
