00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.300
 company 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.550
 the equipment can also add value 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.009
 to other businesses such as a 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.590
 stationery in sÃ£o paulo a factory 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.650
 produce machine with national technology

 see who will start a business 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.230
 the stamp machine has three advantages 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.230
 it's a little practice and cheap 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.369
 The equipment costs one thousand four hundred and 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:35.899
 fifty reais make stamps in 20 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:38.640
 minutes and only one beast 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:41.370
 this technology was not born here in the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.739
 brazil she from another country is the states 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.710
 united pioneered we bring by 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.930
 to be a machine and through this brand 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.190
 we made improvements by adapting it to 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.699
 the brazilian market 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.870
 I have a better cost including 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.420
 that is imported 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:03.190
 bacca of making stamp is all produced 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:08.549
 here in the factory the cut of the work sheet 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:11.380
 the paint assembly and the electrical part 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.080
 to make a stamp first you need 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:17.200
 producing a photolite the process is 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.899
 you create the art on your computer and 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.759
 print on parchment paper 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.850
 then holds that part in a movie 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.770
 plastic and inside the machine that 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.470
 is nothing more than a metal box with 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.390
 ultraviolet light bulbs 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:37.259
 simply press the equipment for a 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.259
 second and reveal the movie 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.600
 you can do the stamps for 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.240
 times here 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.820
 using the whole area of the machine you 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.220
 can make up to 50 academic reversal 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.640
 put one next to the other in the movie 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.680
 but the next to each other leaving the 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.619
 minimum space of five millimeters 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.740
 the next step is to pass the image of the 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:04.200
 photolithography to rubber stamp this 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:08.459
 Resin thick in video light is 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:11.190
 poured on top of the material film 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:16.489
 it is then compressed between two 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:22.320
 goes inside the exact time machine 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:26.100
 320 seconds and ready 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.080
 the image was then transferred to the 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.750
 the film where it forms the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.769
 part is raised by passing light 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:38.640
 where it passes away it hardens to the relief and 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.980
 format file grained rock at the base of the 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.799
 stamp which may be of plastic or 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.519
 the battery well in this kit with 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:50.160
 all the necessary material for r $ 300 gives 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:52.260
 to make 200 cars with it 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.209
 the affection is one of the business 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.130
 that there is this one for 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.840
 example a simple signature stamp 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.030
 it costs the manufacturer a real and 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.470
 twenty-five cents in century stores 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.390
 18 to $ 10 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.810
 another example is that the affection of the type 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:11.160
 cnpj cost price 12 reais in stores 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.860
 leaves for up to 50 reais each to start 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:16.200
 a business is enough a minimum space 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.250
 the equipment fits in one square meter 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:23.160
 of the area and the market is very diverse 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.630
 the notary public uses the stamp 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:31.140
 school uses the way to illustrate is 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.299
 child work is used stationery 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:36.570
 offices also use 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:41.130
 enough to authenticate finally 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:44.970
 a bank it has a high demand for 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:47.460
 market the company comes from 800 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:50.250
 falling per month and invoice 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.980
 two and a half million reais per year 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.970
 lots of people use machines to add 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.680
 value to the business is the case of copiers 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.030
 key chains and stationery like this 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.300
 valdomiro days 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:05.460
 he bought the equipment ten years ago 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:09.260
 achieved an extra billing of a thousand and 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:12.390
 two hundred real gomes provided 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.270
 outsourcing is the one I took from who 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.120
 manufacture time was passing and as demand 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:20.880
 increased I demand was great and I 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.890
 I even decided to publish it, right? 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.640
 And thank God I had a lot of success. 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.640
 there 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:35.010
 this other shop only stamps marcio 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:37.920
 biber has been working in the segment since 74 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.920
 in 2005 he bought two machines and 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:43.440
 It began operating in the specific market 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.050
 of public tenders 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.610
 now account for 90% of revenues 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.500
 from the store 

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:52.620
 you have to be registered in 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:55.230
 government platforms to empower 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:58.590
 have the right to participate in 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:05:01.670
 Martyr's bids are stamped the way 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.010
 that the customer asks for round rectangular 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:08.520
 with up to 10 square centimeters 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:11.850
 the production is high 25 thousand stamps per 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.750
 month for a monthly billing of 50 thousand 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:15.540
 real 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:19.170
 We're already really programming 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.710
 to double production capacity is 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.900
 terms of space because we like people 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.670
 as I said 'not how this market does not 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.670
 It's a problem, we want to know a lot. 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:31.260
 more fell farther than we already 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:33.620
 we have come along for almost 40 years 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.620
 of work
