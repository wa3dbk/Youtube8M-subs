the<00:04:34.080> moment<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.620> had<00:04:34.800> like<00:04:35.040> my<00:04:35.190> first

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
the moment I had like my first

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.750 
the moment I had like my first
professional<00:04:36.090> fight<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:36.420> already<00:04:37.050> had<00:04:37.170> like

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
professional fight I already had like

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.140 
professional fight I already had like
what<00:04:38.760> can<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:39.090> be<00:04:39.120> maybe<00:04:39.450> thirty<00:04:39.900> or<00:04:40.110> forty

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
what can it be maybe thirty or forty

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.270 
what can it be maybe thirty or forty
amber<00:04:42.150> to<00:04:42.300> fight<00:04:42.570> so<00:04:42.810> I<00:04:42.870> was<00:04:43.050> already<00:04:43.850> very

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:46.280 
amber to fight so I was already very

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.470 
amber to fight so I was already very
experienced<00:04:47.280> at<00:04:47.700> that<00:04:47.850> time<00:04:48.060> for<00:04:48.300> a<00:04:48.360> young<00:04:48.600> age

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:50.480 
experienced at that time for a young age

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.460 
experienced at that time for a young age
so<00:04:51.480> the<00:04:51.900> feeling<00:04:52.260> was<00:04:52.410> not<00:04:53.930> very<00:04:54.930> different

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
so the feeling was not very different

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.530 
so the feeling was not very different
wholly<00:04:56.250> different<00:04:56.520> that<00:04:56.850> was<00:04:57.060> is<00:04:57.270> that<00:04:57.300> I<00:04:57.510> was

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
wholly different that was is that I was

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.840 
wholly different that was is that I was
getting<00:04:57.930> I<00:04:58.050> was<00:04:58.140> getting<00:04:58.560> paid<00:04:58.740> for<00:04:59.550> the<00:04:59.640> fight

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
getting I was getting paid for the fight

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.870 
getting I was getting paid for the fight
instead<00:05:00.390> of<00:05:00.510> fighting<00:05:00.900> for<00:05:01.050> free<00:05:01.320> so<00:05:01.790> so<00:05:02.790> the

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
instead of fighting for free so so the

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.720 
instead of fighting for free so so the
feeling<00:05:03.150> was<00:05:03.270> good<00:05:03.420> I<00:05:03.450> think<00:05:04.070> as<00:05:05.070> a<00:05:05.130> red<00:05:05.490> hot

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
feeling was good I think as a red hot

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.790 
feeling was good I think as a red hot
young<00:05:05.940> professional<00:05:06.630> he<00:05:07.110> stepped<00:05:07.380> into<00:05:07.620> the
