it<00:00:45.750> wasn't<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.430> pearlescent<00:00:47.430> wasn't<00:00:47.640> such<00:00:47.789> a

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
it wasn't so pearlescent wasn't such a

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.180 
it wasn't so pearlescent wasn't such a
different<00:00:48.239> color<00:00:48.390> changing<00:00:48.809> Sheen<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
different color changing Sheen to it

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.439 
different color changing Sheen to it
because<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.280> had<00:00:50.579> a<00:00:50.610> paint<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> was<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
because I had a paint so I was like the

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.939 
because I had a paint so I was like the
first<00:00:51.480> pair<00:00:51.809> was<00:00:51.989> like<00:00:52.170> kinda<00:00:52.379> like<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.680> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
first pair was like kinda like the the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:53.540 
first pair was like kinda like the the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
basically all I do is I used to develop

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.530 
basically all I do is I used to develop
man<00:01:17.820> as<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> base<00:01:18.180> shoe<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:20.119> like<00:01:21.119> I<00:01:21.210> was<00:01:21.360> saying

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
man as a base shoe and like I was saying

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.899 
man as a base shoe and like I was saying
before<00:01:22.020> I<00:01:22.290> inverted<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.070> colors<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.610> those

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
before I inverted the colors of those

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.899 
before I inverted the colors of those
regular<00:01:24.299> nerf<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:25.259> generally<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:26.460> purple

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
regular nerf so generally this purple

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.580 
regular nerf so generally this purple
was<00:01:27.630> in<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.900> front<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.290> this<00:01:28.380> system

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
was in the front and this system

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.219 
was in the front and this system
backwards<00:01:29.369> backwards<00:01:29.630> oh<00:01:30.630> yeah<00:01:30.869> there<00:01:30.990> we<00:01:31.020> go

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
backwards backwards oh yeah there we go

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:34.130 
backwards backwards oh yeah there we go
better<00:01:31.770> so<00:01:32.400> that's<00:01:32.610> how<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.850> goes<00:01:33.140> certain

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
better so that's how it goes certain

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.330 
better so that's how it goes certain
kinda<00:01:34.409> got<00:01:34.500> flipped<00:01:34.740> on<00:01:34.829> its<00:01:34.950> head<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.159> little

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
kinda got flipped on its head a little

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.160 
kinda got flipped on its head a little
bit<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:36.360> know<00:01:36.420> different<00:01:36.750> color<00:01:36.930> just<00:01:37.020> so

and all that good stuff even the logos
on<00:01:49.649> the<00:01:49.710> back<00:01:50.060> yeah<00:01:51.060> they're<00:01:51.210> all<00:01:51.329> in

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:52.119 
on the back yeah they're all in

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.969 
on the back yeah they're all in
different<00:01:52.960> like<00:01:53.320> that<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:56.229> then<00:01:56.469> I<00:01:56.740> tried<00:01:56.950> to

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
different like that and then I tried to

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:58.260 
different like that and then I tried to
kind<00:01:57.219> of<00:01:57.340> keep<00:01:57.460> blocking<00:01:57.729> the<00:01:57.969> same<00:01:58.149> one

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
kind of keep blocking the same one

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.240 
kind of keep blocking the same one
that's<00:01:58.299> on<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:58.570> Tom's<00:01:58.869> so<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.829> algorithm<00:02:00.159> is

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
that's on the Tom's so the algorithm is

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.760 
that's on the Tom's so the algorithm is
both<00:02:00.460> on<00:02:00.579> this<00:02:00.729> side<00:02:00.909> and<00:02:01.810> then<00:02:02.020> the<00:02:02.229> other<00:02:02.289> one

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
both on this side and then the other one

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.620 
both on this side and then the other one
the<00:02:02.920> writing<00:02:03.219> was<00:02:03.250> in<00:02:03.490> orange<00:02:03.789> kind<00:02:04.359> of<00:02:04.509> had

the writing was in orange kind of had

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.940 
the writing was in orange kind of had
the<00:02:04.689> same<00:02:04.869> idea<00:02:05.229> was<00:02:05.409> these<00:02:05.770> are<00:02:05.829> the

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
the same idea was these are the

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.449 
the same idea was these are the
