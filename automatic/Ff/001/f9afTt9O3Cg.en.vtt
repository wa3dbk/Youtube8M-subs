get on a big freakin sailing ship and

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.070 
get on a big freakin sailing ship and
that<00:04:43.130> was<00:04:43.310> the<00:04:43.580> best<00:04:43.760> way<00:04:44.000> to<00:04:44.660> go<00:04:44.840> to<00:04:44.900> other

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080

much<00:04:50.270> better<00:04:50.660> for<00:04:50.990> that<00:04:51.020> because<00:04:51.230> they're

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:51.530 
much better for that because they're

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.750 
much better for that because they're
faster<00:04:51.890> there<00:04:52.010> are<00:04:52.070> more<00:04:52.220> efficient<00:04:52.670> it's
