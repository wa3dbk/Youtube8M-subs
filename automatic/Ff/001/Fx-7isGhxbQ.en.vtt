a<00:00:00.060> big<00:00:00.630> part<00:00:00.900> of<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.230> Victoria<00:00:01.709> University

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:02.060 
a big part of the Victoria University

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.960 
a big part of the Victoria University
experience<00:00:03.060> is<00:00:03.980> expanding<00:00:04.980> not<00:00:05.430> only<00:00:05.730> what

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
experience is expanding not only what

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.780 
experience is expanding not only what
you<00:00:06.120> know<00:00:06.299> that<00:00:06.779> how<00:00:07.170> you<00:00:07.230> learn<00:00:07.710> there<00:00:07.980> who<00:00:08.550> of

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
you know that how you learn there who of

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.580 
you know that how you learn there who of
you<00:00:08.970> would<00:00:09.599> like<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.809> go<00:00:10.019> to<00:00:10.080> space

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
you would like to go to space

I<00:00:10.620> believe<00:00:11.550> that<00:00:11.880> outreach<00:00:12.660> is<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.530> core

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
I believe that outreach is a core

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.490 
I believe that outreach is a core
component<00:00:13.920> of<00:00:14.670> what<00:00:15.150> a<00:00:15.179> scientist<00:00:15.809> should<00:00:16.260> do

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
component of what a scientist should do

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.200 
component of what a scientist should do
it's<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.949> star<00:00:17.160> at<00:00:17.310> the<00:00:17.340> end<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:17.670> its<00:00:17.789> life<00:00:17.970> and

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
it's a star at the end of its life and

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.120 
it's a star at the end of its life and
it's<00:00:18.480> forming<00:00:18.900> into<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.350> great<00:00:19.710> big<00:00:19.920> ball<00:00:20.070> of

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
it's forming into this great big ball of

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.029 
it's forming into this great big ball of
diamond<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.850> realize<00:00:21.210> that<00:00:21.600> how<00:00:22.050> we<00:00:22.109> learn<00:00:22.830> is

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
diamond you realize that how we learn is

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.820 
diamond you realize that how we learn is
so<00:00:23.880> much<00:00:24.090> more<00:00:24.330> than<00:00:24.660> just<00:00:24.689> a<00:00:25.050> person<00:00:25.410> talking

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
so much more than just a person talking

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.220 
so much more than just a person talking
in<00:00:25.949> another<00:00:26.070> person<00:00:26.580> listening<00:00:27.000> it's<00:00:27.570> doing

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
in another person listening it's doing

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.589 
in another person listening it's doing
and<00:00:28.470> applying<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:29.400> thinking<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.029> breaking

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
and applying in thinking and breaking

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.530 
and applying in thinking and breaking
stuff<00:00:30.840> and<00:00:31.050> getting<00:00:31.260> it<00:00:31.439> wrong<00:00:31.710> and<00:00:32.420> doing<00:00:33.420> all

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
stuff and getting it wrong and doing all

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.040 
stuff and getting it wrong and doing all
the<00:00:33.690> other<00:00:33.780> stuff<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.140> humans<00:00:34.620> actually<00:00:34.920> do

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050

my<00:00:37.050> experience<00:00:37.980> at<00:00:38.190> Victoria<00:00:38.700> has

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
my experience at Victoria has

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.360 
my experience at Victoria has
fundamentally<00:00:39.960> changed<00:00:40.620> my<00:00:40.739> worldview<00:00:41.070> it's

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
fundamentally changed my worldview it's

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.670 
fundamentally changed my worldview it's
fundamentally<00:00:41.969> changed<00:00:42.329> me<00:00:42.510> as<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:43.110> person

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
fundamentally changed me as a person

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.830 
fundamentally changed me as a person
she<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.610> a<00:00:44.640> hundred<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.210> fifty<00:00:45.480> years<00:00:45.719> old

she is a hundred and fifty years old
it's<00:00:46.140> a<00:00:46.350> very<00:00:46.800> human<00:00:47.579> exercise<00:00:48.120> doing<00:00:48.899> science

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
it's a very human exercise doing science

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.709 
it's a very human exercise doing science
because<00:00:49.590> you've<00:00:50.489> got<00:00:50.700> personalities<00:00:51.390> you've

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
because you've got personalities you've

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.740 
because you've got personalities you've
got<00:00:51.930> hopes<00:00:52.800> and<00:00:53.100> dreams<00:00:53.280> and<00:00:53.760> epic<00:00:54.300> failures

got hopes and dreams and epic failures

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.549 
got hopes and dreams and epic failures

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
people curiosity is like a little flame

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.490 
people curiosity is like a little flame
that<00:01:41.520> keeps<00:01:41.729> burning<00:01:42.150> at<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.509> middle<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:43.350> get

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that keeps burning at the middle you get

that keeps burning at the middle you get
huge<00:01:43.649> amounts<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.040> knowledge<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.549> can<00:01:44.670> do

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
huge amounts of knowledge you can do

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.789 
huge amounts of knowledge you can do
stuff<00:01:44.820> in<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> lab<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.810> get<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.110> meet<00:01:46.290> amazing

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
stuff in the lab you get to meet amazing

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.499

people from all different walks of life
but<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:49.290> little<00:01:49.500> flame<00:01:49.829> of<00:01:50.100> curiosity<00:01:50.759> is

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
but that little flame of curiosity is

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.330

always<00:01:51.360> gonna<00:01:51.600> start<00:01:51.990> putting<00:01:52.439> out<00:01:52.680> questions

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
always gonna start putting out questions

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.069 
always gonna start putting out questions
and<00:01:53.579> it's<00:01:53.909> gonna<00:01:54.000> keep<00:01:54.270> putting<00:01:54.659> them<00:01:54.720> out<00:01:54.899> for

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
and it's gonna keep putting them out for
