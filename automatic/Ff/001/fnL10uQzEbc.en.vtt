recommend having those days back-to-back
I<00:00:49.829> would<00:00:50.129> recommend<00:00:50.550> always<00:00:51.059> having<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.899> least

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
I would recommend always having at least

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.260 
I would recommend always having at least
one<00:00:52.590> day<00:00:52.860> in<00:00:53.100> between<00:00:53.190> squat<00:00:53.850> day<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
one day in between squat day and

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.299 
one day in between squat day and
deadlift<00:00:54.989> day<00:00:55.140> because<00:00:55.500> these<00:00:55.710> are<00:00:55.890> very<00:00:56.129> very

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
deadlift day because these are very very

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.990 
deadlift day because these are very very
taxing<00:00:57.410> exercises<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:59.100> need<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.609> proper

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
taxing exercises and you need the proper

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.900 
taxing exercises and you need the proper
rest<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.570> recuperation<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.680> allow<00:01:02.399> your<00:01:02.699> body

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
rest and recuperation to allow your body

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.210 
rest and recuperation to allow your body
to<00:01:03.120> recover<00:01:03.270> because<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.229> super<00:01:04.619> taxing

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
to recover because it is super taxing

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.219 
to recover because it is super taxing
your<00:01:05.339> CNS<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:06.000> super<00:01:06.420> tackling<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.049> your

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
like if that's their sticking point is

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.729

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.589 
just the actual first maybe a couple
inches<00:03:27.889> I'd<00:03:28.400> really<00:03:28.910> recommend<00:03:29.030> just<00:03:29.510> doing
