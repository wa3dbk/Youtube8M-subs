00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
not but that was the one that I'd one

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.560 
not but that was the one that I'd one
for<00:00:31.619> three<00:00:31.859> thousand<00:00:32.279> coins<00:00:32.430> by<00:00:32.700> now<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.300> it

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
for three thousand coins by now and it

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.510 
for three thousand coins by now and it
hadn't<00:00:33.870> been<00:00:33.930> up<00:00:34.079> for<00:00:34.290> very<00:00:34.469> long<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.399> you

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
hadn't been up for very long and as you

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.760 
hadn't been up for very long and as you
could<00:00:35.640> see<00:00:35.700> here<00:00:36.270> it<00:00:36.719> didn't<00:00:37.110> actually<00:00:37.260> sell

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
could see here it didn't actually sell

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.830 
could see here it didn't actually sell
for<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.100> much<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.700> think<00:00:39.120> I<00:00:39.239> put<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:39.570> up<00:00:39.690> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
for that much I think I put it up a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.830 
for that much I think I put it up a
little<00:00:40.050> bit<00:00:40.200> too<00:00:40.910> expensive<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.540> dropped

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
little bit too expensive so I dropped

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.510 
little bit too expensive so I dropped
the<00:00:42.930> price<00:00:43.110> down<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.410> three<00:00:43.950> thousand<00:00:44.340> six

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the price down to three thousand six

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.029 
the price down to three thousand six
hundred<00:00:44.579> coins<00:00:44.910> by<00:00:45.239> now<00:00:45.420> with<00:00:45.570> a<00:00:45.660> 3.4<00:00:46.410> k<00:00:46.620> start

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
hundred coins by now with a 3.4 k start

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.889 
hundred coins by now with a 3.4 k start
price<00:00:47.309> hoping<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.510> will<00:00:48.660> possibly

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
price hoping that this will possibly

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.069 
price hoping that this will possibly
sell<00:00:49.559> on<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.129> as<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.270> see<00:00:51.300> in<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.870> clip

start with a 7.7 k by now so hoping to

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.050 
start with a 7.7 k by now so hoping to
make<00:01:51.119> about<00:01:51.680> 600<00:01:52.680> 500<00:01:53.220> coins<00:01:53.369> after-tax

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
make about 600 500 coins after-tax

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.480 
make about 600 500 coins after-tax
profit<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:54.930> player<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.280> can<00:01:56.460> see

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
minute but as you can see we've won in

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.729 
minute but as you can see we've won in
48.5<00:03:43.450> k<00:03:43.720> there<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.170> we're<00:03:44.290> just<00:03:44.380> going<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.620> go

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
48.5 k there and we're just going to go

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.830

here for I can't remember exactly how

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:07.080 
here for I can't remember exactly how
much<00:04:04.780> but<00:04:04.989> as<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:05.200> said<00:04:05.260> before<00:04:05.410> around<00:04:06.250> 10k

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
much but as I said before around 10k

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.930 
much but as I said before around 10k
which<00:04:07.690> you<00:04:07.840> will<00:04:07.989> see<00:04:08.019> in<00:04:08.200> a<00:04:08.350> minute<00:04:08.700> 9.3<00:04:09.700> so

which you will see in a minute 9.3 so

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.370 
which you will see in a minute 9.3 so
around<00:04:10.360> 10k<00:04:10.989> and<00:04:11.790> hoping<00:04:12.790> to<00:04:13.209> make<00:04:13.480> back<00:04:13.810> about

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
around 10k and hoping to make back about

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.900 
around 10k and hoping to make back about
9k<00:04:15.190> after<00:04:15.459> tax<00:04:15.790> as<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.630> can<00:04:16.750> see<00:04:17.400> 9380<00:04:18.400> for<00:04:18.729> we

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
9k after tax as you can see 9380 for we

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:21.150 
9k after tax as you can see 9380 for we
did<00:04:19.090> not<00:04:19.299> move<00:04:19.510> up<00:04:19.720> at<00:04:19.900> all<00:04:20.229> much<00:04:20.590> there<00:04:20.919> and

did not move up at all much there and

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.610 
did not move up at all much there and
that<00:04:21.880> is<00:04:22.000> just<00:04:22.030> proof<00:04:22.450> that<00:04:22.510> these<00:04:22.960> BPL

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
that is just proof that these BPL

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.060 
that is just proof that these BPL
