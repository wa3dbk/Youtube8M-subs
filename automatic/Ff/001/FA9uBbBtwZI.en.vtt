 yes I know well too 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.540
 and at what age did you start the trumpet 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.490

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.500
 today 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.610
 but I had it together 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.830
 it is common sense 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.320

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.380

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.260

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.300
 will it engage europe never know what are you playing 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.200

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.550
 gonzalez - klose who worked with marcel marceau 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.550

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.780
 for one hundred years 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:58.780
 Hammerson 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:32.939
 for 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:27.379
 % 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:43.449
 % 

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:46.449
 in Europe 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:07.299
 some 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.299
 for his 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.859
 in 

00:05:01.259 --> 00:05:02.339
 that's great 

00:05:02.339 --> 00:05:06.459

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:07.830
 all peace of mind history 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.160
 these dividends already said that in this world 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.370
 But who are these people 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.870
 they have to continue like that, they do not care too much in their 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.340
 questions I would like that would surprise me you would not want someone to do us 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:20.020
 that you stay where you are, that is to say young mothers who 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.830
 will certainly require with me I hope in the eyes their youth crates 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.430
 of the 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:26.210
 the page 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.190
