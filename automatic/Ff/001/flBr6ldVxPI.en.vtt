00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:24.800 
think that's just a bad gasket and it

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.960 
think that's just a bad gasket and it
only<00:03:24.890> does<00:03:25.010> that<00:03:25.250> when<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.460> lean<00:03:25.610> it<00:03:25.700> over<00:03:25.730> to

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
only does that when you lean it over to

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.180 
only does that when you lean it over to
the<00:03:26.060> side<00:03:26.270> it's<00:03:27.260> kind<00:03:27.440> of<00:03:27.500> annoying<00:03:27.710> but<00:03:28.010> it

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
the side it's kind of annoying but it

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.820 
the side it's kind of annoying but it
doesn't<00:03:28.540> there's<00:03:29.540> no<00:03:29.690> leak<00:03:30.320> out<00:03:30.440> of<00:03:30.590> here

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830
