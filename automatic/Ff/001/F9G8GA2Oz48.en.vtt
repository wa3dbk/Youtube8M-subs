usually<00:02:56.569> will<00:02:56.900> turn<00:02:57.049> on<00:02:58.060> and<00:02:59.060> it<00:02:59.180> didn't<00:02:59.390> for

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
usually will turn on and it didn't for

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.059 
usually will turn on and it didn't for
that<00:02:59.599> so<00:02:59.810> push<00:03:00.290> it<00:03:00.410> all<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.500> way<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.650> go<00:03:00.859> okay

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
that so push it all the way to go okay

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:04.330 
that so push it all the way to go okay
that's<00:03:01.519> just<00:03:01.579> cause<00:03:01.819> the<00:03:01.910> latch<00:03:03.220> yeah<00:03:04.220> the

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
that's just cause the latch yeah the

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.800 
that's just cause the latch yeah the
latch<00:03:04.519> makes<00:03:04.819> it<00:03:04.970> just<00:03:05.000> high<00:03:05.329> enough<00:03:05.359> so<00:03:05.720> it

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
latch makes it just high enough so it

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.150 
latch makes it just high enough so it
doesn't<00:03:06.079> do<00:03:06.140> it<00:03:06.230> automatically<00:03:06.739> so<00:03:06.980> when<00:03:07.099> you

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
doesn't do it automatically so when you

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.539 
doesn't do it automatically so when you
latch<00:03:07.310> it<00:03:07.519> down<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.930> then<00:03:09.079> unlatch<00:03:09.440> it<00:03:09.549> yeah

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
latch it down and then unlatch it yeah

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.819 
latch it down and then unlatch it yeah
comes<00:03:10.849> right<00:03:10.970> back<00:03:11.090> on<00:03:11.299> very<00:03:11.870> cool<00:03:12.109> alright<00:03:12.650> so

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
comes right back on very cool alright so

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:15.390 
comes right back on very cool alright so
the<00:03:13.190> standing<00:03:13.609> positions<00:03:14.030> with<00:03:14.209> this<00:03:14.359> case

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
the standing positions with this case

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.460 
the standing positions with this case

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:20.659 
they snap right off kind of have to go

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:22.780 
they snap right off kind of have to go

out of the shot here and if you're

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
out of the shot here and if you're
wondering<00:03:22.819> about<00:03:23.060> my<00:03:23.239> background<00:03:23.420> it's<00:03:23.750> a

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:23.810 
wondering about my background it's a

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.800 
wondering about my background it's a
Gundam<00:03:24.109> so<00:03:24.799> there<00:03:25.459> you<00:03:25.640> go<00:03:25.670> and<00:03:26.030> this<00:03:26.569> is<00:03:26.690> how

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
Gundam so there you go and this is how

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.259 
Gundam so there you go and this is how
the<00:03:26.870> case<00:03:27.109> works<00:03:27.349> you<00:03:28.040> put<00:03:28.250> in<00:03:28.340> each<00:03:28.519> notch<00:03:28.849> so

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
the case works you put in each notch so

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:31.360 
the case works you put in each notch so
yes<00:03:29.599> this<00:03:29.810> part<00:03:30.109> of<00:03:30.290> the<00:03:30.470> ipad<00:03:30.739> is<00:03:30.799> exposed

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
yes this part of the ipad is exposed

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.129 
yes this part of the ipad is exposed
when<00:03:32.030> it's<00:03:32.150> in<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.329> standing<00:03:32.630> position<00:03:32.720> I

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
when it's in the standing position I

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.900 
when it's in the standing position I
prefer<00:03:33.680> the<00:03:33.829> top<00:03:34.099> two<00:03:34.280> notches<00:03:34.489> here<00:03:34.760> the

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
prefer the top two notches here the

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.539 
prefer the top two notches here the
bottom<00:03:35.209> one<00:03:35.359> is<00:03:35.829> it's<00:03:36.829> it's<00:03:37.040> actually<00:03:37.370> not

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
bottom one is it's it's actually not

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:39.580 
bottom one is it's it's actually not
very<00:03:37.609> deep<00:03:38.299> that<00:03:38.510> last<00:03:38.780> notch<00:03:39.019> so<00:03:39.290> if<00:03:39.470> you're

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
very deep that last notch so if you're

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.170 
very deep that last notch so if you're
doing<00:03:39.829> something<00:03:40.040> like<00:03:40.250> gaming<00:03:40.579> or<00:03:40.819> something

doing something like gaming or something

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:43.030 
doing something like gaming or something
it<00:03:41.569> actually<00:03:41.900> might<00:03:42.319> come<00:03:42.560> out<00:03:42.620> of<00:03:42.769> that<00:03:42.799> see

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
it actually might come out of that see

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.349 
it actually might come out of that see
like<00:03:43.220> that<00:03:43.400> they<00:03:43.790> might<00:03:44.000> come<00:03:44.120> out<00:03:44.209> of<00:03:44.329> that

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
like that they might come out of that

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.150 
like that they might come out of that
but<00:03:44.720> as<00:03:44.930> long<00:03:45.109> as<00:03:45.260> you<00:03:45.349> kind<00:03:45.799> of<00:03:45.829> put<00:03:46.010> it<00:03:46.099> in

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
but as long as you kind of put it in

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.229 
but as long as you kind of put it in
there<00:03:46.280> a<00:03:46.310> little<00:03:46.430> bit<00:03:46.579> vertical<00:03:46.940> and<00:03:47.030> set<00:03:47.150> it

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
there a little bit vertical and set it

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.449 
there a little bit vertical and set it
down<00:03:47.329> it's<00:03:47.510> fine<00:03:47.660> so<00:03:48.590> you<00:03:48.650> can<00:03:48.859> watch<00:03:48.980> movies

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
down it's fine so you can watch movies

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.039 
down it's fine so you can watch movies
and<00:03:49.609> so<00:03:49.790> forth<00:03:50.000> in<00:03:50.090> that<00:03:50.209> lower<00:03:50.359> position<00:03:50.840> but

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
and so forth in that lower position but

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.839 
and so forth in that lower position but
i<00:03:51.260> think<00:03:51.680> the<00:03:51.799> middle<00:03:52.069> one<00:03:52.250> is<00:03:52.280> the<00:03:52.669> best

00:03:52.839 --> 00:03:52.849 
i think the middle one is the best

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.150 
i think the middle one is the best
position<00:03:53.299> and<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:54.260> know<00:03:54.349> it<00:03:54.470> stays<00:03:54.739> perfectly

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.160 
position and you know it stays perfectly

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.009 
position and you know it stays perfectly
and<00:03:55.340> all<00:03:55.400> those<00:03:55.519> notches<00:03:55.970> sorry<00:03:56.690> for<00:03:56.840> the<00:03:56.870> bad

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:57.019 
and all those notches sorry for the bad

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.860 
and all those notches sorry for the bad
position<00:03:57.440> here<00:03:57.500> there<00:03:58.040> we<00:03:58.099> go<00:03:58.419> in<00:03:59.419> the<00:03:59.510> top<00:03:59.660> one

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
position here there we go in the top one

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.770 
position here there we go in the top one
is<00:04:00.019> of<00:04:00.169> course<00:04:00.319> very<00:04:00.620> vertical<00:04:01.389> just<00:04:02.389> like<00:04:02.540> so

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:02.780 
is of course very vertical just like so

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.689 
is of course very vertical just like so
we<00:04:03.260> kind<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.530> rotate<00:04:03.889> the<00:04:04.010> surrounding<00:04:04.459> kinda

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:04.699 
we kind of rotate the surrounding kinda

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:08.199 
we kind of rotate the surrounding kinda
see<00:04:04.790> it<00:04:04.819> looks<00:04:05.060> like<00:04:06.609> just<00:04:07.609> like<00:04:07.760> one<00:04:08.030> of<00:04:08.120> the

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
see it looks like just like one of the

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:10.809 
see it looks like just like one of the
original<00:04:08.720> you<00:04:09.470> bow<00:04:09.620> magic<00:04:10.040> case<00:04:10.190> so<00:04:10.549> it's

00:04:10.809 --> 00:04:10.819 
original you bow magic case so it's

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:13.839 
original you bow magic case so it's
fantastic<00:04:11.660> i<00:04:11.750> love<00:04:12.079> the<00:04:12.290> design<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:12.980> now<00:04:13.790> the

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
fantastic i love the design and now the

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.210 
fantastic i love the design and now the
typing<00:04:14.269> position<00:04:14.389> this<00:04:15.139> is<00:04:15.440> not<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.709> typing

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
typing position this is not the typing

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.819 
typing position this is not the typing
position<00:04:16.370> or<00:04:17.060> at<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.109> lowest<00:04:18.440> one<00:04:18.590> that<00:04:18.739> is

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
position or at the lowest one that is

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.800 
position or at the lowest one that is
not<00:04:18.979> it<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.760> let's<00:04:20.180> go<00:04:20.269> ahead<00:04:20.299> with<00:04:20.419> this<00:04:20.599> back

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:20.810 
not it so let's go ahead with this back

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.890 
not it so let's go ahead with this back
down<00:04:21.049> and<00:04:21.729> snaps<00:04:22.729> right<00:04:22.880> back<00:04:23.090> in<00:04:23.300> did<00:04:23.750> you

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
down and snaps right back in did you

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.550 
down and snaps right back in did you
hurt<00:04:24.110> it<00:04:24.199> and<00:04:24.470> this<00:04:25.250> is<00:04:25.430> the<00:04:25.550> typing<00:04:25.820> position

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
hurt it and this is the typing position

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.839 
hurt it and this is the typing position
it's<00:04:27.560> still<00:04:27.800> mine<00:04:28.039> is<00:04:28.190> still<00:04:28.280> brand<00:04:28.639> new<00:04:28.729> so

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:28.849 
it's still mine is still brand new so

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:30.189 
it's still mine is still brand new so
you<00:04:28.970> just<00:04:29.060> have<00:04:29.180> to<00:04:29.270> pin<00:04:29.630> that<00:04:29.780> just<00:04:29.990> a<00:04:30.020> little

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:30.199 
you just have to pin that just a little

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.839 
you just have to pin that just a little
bit<00:04:30.320> and<00:04:30.380> there<00:04:30.500> you<00:04:30.590> go<00:04:30.620> it's<00:04:31.430> kind<00:04:31.669> of<00:04:31.699> just

bit and there you go it's kind of just

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.779 
bit and there you go it's kind of just
like<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.120> original<00:04:32.210> apple<00:04:32.750> case<00:04:33.550> style<00:04:34.550> you

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.209 
like the original apple case style you
know<00:04:34.849> you<00:04:34.940> got<00:04:35.090> about<00:04:35.210> that<00:04:36.110> much<00:04:36.169> right<00:04:36.919> there

00:04:37.209 --> 00:04:37.219 
know you got about that much right there

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:38.760 
know you got about that much right there
on<00:04:37.430> typing

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
on typing

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.189 
on typing
it<00:04:38.860> works<00:04:39.009> great<00:04:39.129> I<00:04:39.430> really<00:04:39.759> like<00:04:39.879> it<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.960> is<00:04:41.169> a

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
it works great I really like it it is a

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.499 
it works great I really like it it is a
new<00:04:41.860> case<00:04:42.250> so<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.520> does<00:04:42.849> have<00:04:43.090> a<00:04:43.120> little<00:04:43.240> bit<00:04:43.389> of

00:04:43.499 --> 00:04:43.509 
new case so it does have a little bit of

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:45.300 
new case so it does have a little bit of
break<00:04:43.720> in<00:04:43.840> period<00:04:44.050> for<00:04:44.289> this<00:04:44.440> this<00:04:45.009> part<00:04:45.250> right

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
break in period for this this part right

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.059 
break in period for this this part right
here<00:04:45.490> but<00:04:46.479> all<00:04:46.720> the<00:04:47.020> stitching<00:04:47.409> is<00:04:47.530> very<00:04:47.830> tight

00:04:48.059 --> 00:04:48.069 
here but all the stitching is very tight

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:51.300 
here but all the stitching is very tight
and<00:04:48.099> looks<00:04:48.370> good<00:04:49.020> when<00:04:50.020> you<00:04:50.110> close<00:04:50.379> it<00:04:50.409> this

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
and looks good when you close it this

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.520 
and looks good when you close it this
actually<00:04:51.599> there<00:04:52.599> you<00:04:52.690> go<00:04:52.810> the<00:04:53.020> latch<00:04:53.169> does

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
actually there you go the latch does

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.490 
actually there you go the latch does

revisions<00:05:22.840> up<00:05:23.169> in<00:05:23.289> my<00:05:23.380> opinion<00:05:23.650> but<00:05:23.949> it<00:05:24.460> had<00:05:24.580> a

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:24.610 
revisions up in my opinion but it had a

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:26.219 
revisions up in my opinion but it had a
border<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.210> i<00:05:25.270> kind<00:05:25.659> of<00:05:25.690> really<00:05:25.900> like<00:05:26.080> the

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
border and i kind of really like the

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.820 
border and i kind of really like the
borderless<00:05:27.000> ipad<00:05:28.000> cases<00:05:28.210> so<00:05:28.650> this<00:05:29.650> is

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
borderless ipad cases so this is

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.469 
borderless ipad cases so this is
definitely<00:05:30.009> one<00:05:30.250> of<00:05:30.310> my<00:05:30.400> favorites<00:05:30.880> and<00:05:31.150> they

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
definitely one of my favorites and they

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:32.670 
definitely one of my favorites and they
pretty<00:05:31.690> much<00:05:31.750> nailed<00:05:32.139> it<00:05:32.259> here<00:05:32.380> on<00:05:32.440> the<00:05:32.500> first

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:32.680 
pretty much nailed it here on the first

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.279 
pretty much nailed it here on the first
try<00:05:33.009> i<00:05:33.849> guess<00:05:34.270> my<00:05:34.300> only<00:05:34.449> complaint<00:05:35.020> would<00:05:35.169> be

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
try i guess my only complaint would be

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:36.959 
try i guess my only complaint would be
that<00:05:35.440> first<00:05:35.680> notch<00:05:36.039> but<00:05:36.340> i<00:05:36.400> don't<00:05:36.610> use<00:05:36.819> it

00:05:36.959 --> 00:05:36.969 
that first notch but i don't use it

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:40.529 
that first notch but i don't use it
anyway<00:05:37.300> and<00:05:38.789> even<00:05:39.789> then<00:05:39.969> it's<00:05:40.150> not<00:05:40.210> that<00:05:40.509> much

00:05:40.529 --> 00:05:40.539 
anyway and even then it's not that much

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:42.209 
anyway and even then it's not that much
i<00:05:40.840> wouldn't<00:05:41.349> even<00:05:41.409> consider<00:05:41.620> it<00:05:41.889> a<00:05:42.009> deal

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:42.219 
i wouldn't even consider it a deal

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:44.279 
i wouldn't even consider it a deal
