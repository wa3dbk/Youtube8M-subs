 to fight their large 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:56.599
 continentals assuming a position and 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:59.540
 that the earth is a double first

 kidnapper is one more war under 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.430
 these three of heap of feeling of 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.010
 some in coders 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.689
 start the profits to the result in 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:09.549
 both sides in the insurance that would be of 

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:10.140
 I return their homes for the day nothing 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:13.439
 this year 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.459
 ds / ag sorry and it would come to victory 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:18.519
 nothing further from what 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.079
 truly happened and the troops of 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.729
 the battle fronts will not return to 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.400
 home for that date and the war will 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.440
 extended until November 11, 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.870
 1918 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:31.410
 however a hope light ring 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:33.270
 the eve of December 1814, one 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.460
 of the most bizarre events and 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:37.920
 recorded the military history had 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.870
 place on the western front everything 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.360
 started from the animal sector the 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.980
 soldiers began lighting candles 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.320
 British sentinels reported to their 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:49.410
 officers would be small raised lights 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:51.150
 on poles or bayonets is on the internet 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.280
 clearly illuminated our pair 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.680
 German has been vulnerable to gunfire 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.140
 enemies however the British are 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.910
 they resisted firing and what resulted 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.950
 more surprising was that the officers 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.270
 they saw through their binoculars that 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.100
 some men of the German army 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.700
 they held Christmas trees on their 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.410
 heads with candles from their branches to the 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.960
 few moments of bs signal the 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.250
 British began to hear some 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.370
 of the Germans singing a Christmas carol 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.950
 Christmas was very soon 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.300
 all the lengths of the German lines 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.550
 British troops recognized 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.680
 immediately the melody was night of 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.270
 peace and very soon all are neutralized 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.310
 the activities 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.470
 one by one British soldiers and 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.110
 Germans and Germans started to leave 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.000
 their weapons aside and leave bound for 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:38.460
 Nobody's land 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.320
 So many soldiers from both sides came out 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:43.230
 his trenches and superior officers 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:45.390
 are prevented from avoiding this reaction 

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:48.630
 spontaneously there was an undeclared truce 

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:50.820
 and peace broke out franklin chang a 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.650
 witness of this unofficial truce in his 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.740
 earth journal wrote we raise 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:57.870
 a blackboard with happy christmas written on 

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.310
 the book also antonio equal where 

00:05:57.870 --> 00:06:01.590
 our men threw their equal 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:03.870
 loose and they jumped out of their pete 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.970

 Germans doing the same two of ours 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.760
 they walked to meet them they 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.070
 they gave their hands and then all 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:16.620
 we left the trenches and so 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.060
 same made the Germans richards 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.070
 he also explained that some soldiers 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:23.190
 Germans spoke English perfectly 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.720
 well one of them saying fourth 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.800
 they were from the guide that it would be very 

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:29.169
 happy when all termination 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:31.509
 its British counterpart returns 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:33.370
 tonight in soldiers and until that 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:35.740
 moment they were enemies are points

 around the leather suit that also 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.030
 a small gifts of his power and 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:44.500
 belongings for said tails of buttons 

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:46.900

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:54.690
 families 

00:06:56.889 --> 00:07:04.730
