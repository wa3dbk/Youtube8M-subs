seats<00:00:21.279> can<00:00:22.240> be<00:00:23.070> straight<00:00:24.070> up<00:00:24.250> like<00:00:24.460> this<00:00:24.699> or

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
seats can be straight up like this or

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.079 
seats can be straight up like this or
they<00:00:25.300> can<00:00:25.509> be<00:00:25.750> reclined<00:00:26.160> now<00:00:27.160> I<00:00:27.490> have<00:00:27.849> it<00:00:27.970> in

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:28.089 
they can be reclined now I have it in

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:30.540 
they can be reclined now I have it in
the<00:00:28.210> straight<00:00:28.480> up<00:00:28.630> position<00:00:29.199> and<00:00:29.410> you<00:00:30.160> can<00:00:30.310> see

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
the straight up position and you can see

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.890 
the straight up position and you can see
that<00:00:31.269> that<00:00:31.689> makes<00:00:31.929> this<00:00:32.169> level<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:34.120> it<00:00:34.690> rest

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
that that makes this level and it rest

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.729 
that that makes this level and it rest
right<00:00:35.020> here<00:00:35.170> on<00:00:35.500> here<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.840> when<00:00:37.989> we<00:00:38.020> had<00:00:38.379> the

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:38.739 
right here on here but when we had the

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:41.819 
right here on here but when we had the
car<00:00:39.010> seat<00:00:39.280> in<00:00:39.489> just<00:00:40.239> a<00:00:40.710> reclined<00:00:41.710> position

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829 
car seat in just a reclined position

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.119 
car seat in just a reclined position
which<00:00:42.820> probably<00:00:43.210> put<00:00:43.719> it<00:00:43.809> at<00:00:43.960> it<00:00:44.110> just<00:00:45.010> a

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
which probably put it at it just a

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.139 
which probably put it at it just a
smidgen<00:00:45.940> more<00:00:46.149> of<00:00:46.239> an<00:00:46.329> angle<00:00:46.920> this<00:00:47.920> was<00:00:48.910> more

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
smidgen more of an angle this was more

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.189 
smidgen more of an angle this was more
like<00:00:49.180> this<00:00:49.809> we<00:00:50.590> still<00:00:50.859> were<00:00:50.980> able<00:00:51.309> to<00:00:51.340> use<00:00:51.670> it

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
like this we still were able to use it

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.229 
like this we still were able to use it
but<00:00:53.199> his<00:00:53.350> food<00:00:53.590> had<00:00:53.800> a<00:00:53.829> tendency<00:00:54.160> to<00:00:54.760> roll

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
but his food had a tendency to roll

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.540 
but his food had a tendency to roll
towards<00:00:55.870> him<00:00:56.140> so<00:00:56.829> that's<00:00:57.039> just<00:00:57.160> something<00:00:57.399> to

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
towards him so that's just something to

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.410 
towards him so that's just something to
keep<00:00:57.640> in<00:00:57.910> mind<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.800> has<00:01:00.010> pockets<00:01:00.699> on<00:01:01.000> this<00:01:01.149> side

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
keep in mind it has pockets on this side

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.400 
keep in mind it has pockets on this side
and<00:01:02.640> pockets<00:01:03.640> on<00:01:03.760> this<00:01:03.910> side<00:01:04.180> we<00:01:05.080> don't<00:01:05.260> really

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
and pockets on this side we don't really

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:08.039 
and pockets on this side we don't really
use<00:01:05.740> those<00:01:05.980> much<00:01:06.250> he<00:01:07.180> can't<00:01:07.420> actually<00:01:07.630> reach

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:08.049 
use those much he can't actually reach

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:10.830 
use those much he can't actually reach
them<00:01:08.320> um<00:01:08.560> we<00:01:09.310> went<00:01:09.430> on<00:01:09.580> a<00:01:09.610> nine-hour<00:01:10.119> vacation

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:10.840 
them um we went on a nine-hour vacation

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.620 
them um we went on a nine-hour vacation
trip<00:01:11.110> and<00:01:11.350> you<00:01:12.310> know<00:01:12.430> I<00:01:12.460> kept<00:01:12.850> like<00:01:13.060> his<00:01:13.240> cup<00:01:13.450> in

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:13.630 
trip and you know I kept like his cup in

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.570 
trip and you know I kept like his cup in
there<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.320> it<00:01:14.439> was<00:01:14.560> easy<00:01:14.710> for<00:01:14.920> me<00:01:15.070> to<00:01:15.100> get<00:01:15.340> to

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:15.580 
there so it was easy for me to get to

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.450 
there so it was easy for me to get to
but<00:01:16.570> um<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:18.250> sides<00:01:18.549> are<00:01:18.850> very<00:01:19.500> flexible<00:01:20.500> so

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:21.460 
but um the sides are very flexible so

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.700 
but um the sides are very flexible so
when<00:01:22.329> it's<00:01:22.479> in<00:01:22.600> storage<00:01:22.930> for<00:01:23.200> a<00:01:23.229> long<00:01:23.409> period

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:23.710 
when it's in storage for a long period

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:26.550 
when it's in storage for a long period
of<00:01:23.740> time<00:01:23.979> it<00:01:24.490> becomes<00:01:24.820> a<00:01:24.939> little<00:01:25.180> deformed<00:01:25.630> but

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
of time it becomes a little deformed but

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.770 
of time it becomes a little deformed but
I<00:01:26.890> didn't<00:01:27.490> have<00:01:27.579> any<00:01:27.729> problem<00:01:28.180> shaping<00:01:28.659> it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
I didn't have any problem shaping it

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.620 
I didn't have any problem shaping it
back<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:30.250> its<00:01:30.400> original<00:01:30.520> position<00:01:31.030> you<00:01:31.509> can

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
back to its original position you can

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.929 
back to its original position you can
see<00:01:31.780> how<00:01:31.899> that's<00:01:32.049> kind<00:01:32.320> of<00:01:32.409> leaning<00:01:32.770> in<00:01:32.950> but

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
see how that's kind of leaning in but

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.319 
see how that's kind of leaning in but
overall<00:01:34.240> it<00:01:34.570> does<00:01:34.780> what<00:01:35.380> it<00:01:35.500> should<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:37.119> is

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
overall it does what it should there is

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.740 
overall it does what it should there is
a<00:01:37.360> strap<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:39.040> goes<00:01:39.250> behind<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:39.909> car<00:01:40.149> seat<00:01:40.450> I

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
a strap that goes behind the car seat I

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.710 
a strap that goes behind the car seat I
actually<00:01:41.500> have<00:01:41.829> it<00:01:41.950> going<00:01:42.220> through<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:43.450> hole

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
actually have it going through the hole

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.560 
actually have it going through the hole
where<00:01:44.020> the<00:01:44.049> seat<00:01:44.350> belt<00:01:44.560> goes<00:01:44.829> it<00:01:45.820> comes<00:01:46.270> around

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
where the seat belt goes it comes around

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.010 
where the seat belt goes it comes around
to<00:01:46.719> the<00:01:46.780> other<00:01:46.960> side<00:01:47.229> it<00:01:47.890> does<00:01:48.130> have<00:01:48.280> a<00:01:48.340> snap<00:01:49.020> so

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
to the other side it does have a snap so

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.230 
to the other side it does have a snap so
what<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.200> suggest<00:01:50.439> doing<00:01:51.040> on<00:01:51.430> a<00:01:51.460> long<00:01:51.700> trip<00:01:51.909> is

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
what I suggest doing on a long trip is

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.700 
what I suggest doing on a long trip is
leaving<00:01:53.170> that<00:01:54.600> strap<00:01:55.600> behind<00:01:56.079> the<00:01:56.200> car<00:01:56.409> seat
