00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
it'll probably be a little bit of a

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.589 
it'll probably be a little bit of a
shorter<00:00:13.349> review<00:00:13.620> than<00:00:13.799> usual<00:00:14.190> but<00:00:14.519> um<00:00:14.849> there

still were some interesting points in it

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.179 
still were some interesting points in it
um<00:00:17.670> it<00:00:18.270> was<00:00:18.420> okay<00:00:18.779> was<00:00:18.990> very<00:00:19.320> dialogue<00:00:19.890> heavy

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
um it was okay was very dialogue heavy

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.720 
um it was okay was very dialogue heavy
but<00:00:21.119> um<00:00:21.359> we<00:00:21.900> definitely<00:00:22.740> got<00:00:22.890> introduced<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.609> a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
but um we definitely got introduced to a

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.880 
but um we definitely got introduced to a
very<00:00:24.090> new<00:00:24.390> interesting<00:00:25.019> power<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.619> I<00:00:25.710> just

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
very new interesting power and I just

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.620 
very new interesting power and I just
have<00:00:26.039> to<00:00:26.070> say<00:00:26.189> so<00:00:26.369> Kashi<00:00:26.820> man<00:00:27.240> he<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.510> so

creative<00:00:28.140> with<00:00:28.470> these<00:00:28.769> inabilities<00:00:29.660> because

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
creative with these inabilities because

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.930 
creative with these inabilities because
it's<00:00:31.170> really<00:00:31.650> hard<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.250> distinguish<00:00:32.759> like

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
it's really hard to distinguish like

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.900 
it's really hard to distinguish like
which<00:00:33.210> categories<00:00:33.989> of<00:00:34.530> like<00:00:35.160> what<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.730> don't

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
which categories of like what I don't

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.910 
which categories of like what I don't
know<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.239> I<00:00:36.570> think<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.140> know<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.440> category<00:00:37.860> is

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
know like I think I know the category is

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.950 
know like I think I know the category is
pretty<00:00:38.250> well<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.879> some<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.420> these<00:00:39.510> powers

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
pretty well and some of these powers

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.440 
pretty well and some of these powers
just<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.500> unique<00:00:40.800> it's<00:00:41.340> very<00:00:41.640> hard<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.059> tell

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
just so unique it's very hard to tell

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.069 
just so unique it's very hard to tell
but<00:00:42.870> um<00:00:43.110> um<00:00:43.649> it<00:00:44.190> was<00:00:44.309> an<00:00:44.430> okay<00:00:44.789> episode<00:00:45.300> what

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
but um um it was an okay episode what

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.990 
but um um it was an okay episode what
was<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.350> like<00:00:46.500> horrible<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.520> because<00:00:47.760> we<00:00:47.879> got

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
was it like horrible just because we got

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.590 
was it like horrible just because we got
introduced<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.539> some<00:00:48.750> new<00:00:48.899> things<00:00:49.260> but

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
introduced to some new things but

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.450 
introduced to some new things but
average<00:00:51.600> episode<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.530> I<00:00:52.710> guess<00:00:52.829> I'll<00:00:53.010> go

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
average episode and I guess I'll go

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.979 
average episode and I guess I'll go
through<00:00:53.730> some<00:00:53.910> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.090> main<00:00:54.300> points<00:00:54.750> of<00:00:54.809> what

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
through some of the main points of what

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.979 
through some of the main points of what
i<00:00:55.020> thought<00:00:55.320> was<00:00:55.440> interesting<00:00:55.649> episode<00:00:56.629> so<00:00:57.629> in

what was going on because um
I<00:02:13.480> also<00:02:13.990> said<00:02:14.290> this<00:02:14.470> in<00:02:14.650> one<00:02:14.830> of<00:02:14.860> my<00:02:14.980> early

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
I also said this in one of my early

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.520 
I also said this in one of my early
reviews<00:02:15.790> that<00:02:18.720> human-like<00:02:19.720> memories<00:02:20.230> were

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
reviews that human-like memories were

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.280 
reviews that human-like memories were
going<00:02:20.770> to<00:02:20.830> come<00:02:21.070> into<00:02:21.430> like<00:02:21.990> play<00:02:22.990> in<00:02:23.170> the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:23.290 
going to come into like play in the

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:24.870 
going to come into like play in the
story<00:02:23.620> i<00:02:23.710> just<00:02:23.800> knew<00:02:24.160> they<00:02:24.340> weren't<00:02:24.580> just

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
story i just knew they weren't just

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.570 
story i just knew they weren't just
because<00:02:25.150> some<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.390> them<00:02:25.570> were<00:02:25.690> getting<00:02:25.990> human

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
because some of them were getting human

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.010 
because some of them were getting human
memories<00:02:27.580> or<00:02:27.790> memories<00:02:28.120> of<00:02:28.270> their<00:02:28.360> past<00:02:28.630> lives

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
memories or memories of their past lives

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.820 
memories or memories of their past lives

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
think that they will play a huge part in

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.630 
think that they will play a huge part in
the<00:02:34.630> story<00:02:34.840> and<00:02:34.990> they<00:02:35.350> did<00:02:35.620> because<00:02:35.980> he<00:02:36.370> find

disability<00:03:15.910> in<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.390> better<00:03:16.630> way<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.290> I<00:03:18.220> he<00:03:18.700> was

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
disability in a better way and I he was

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.550 
disability in a better way and I he was
talking<00:03:19.090> about<00:03:19.120> knuckle<00:03:19.870> but<00:03:20.110> in<00:03:20.260> my<00:03:20.410> opinion

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
talking about knuckle but in my opinion

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.860 
talking about knuckle but in my opinion
that<00:03:20.860> makes<00:03:21.190> no<00:03:21.459> sense<00:03:21.489> why<00:03:22.060> would<00:03:22.330> he<00:03:22.570> like

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
that makes no sense why would he like

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.530 
that makes no sense why would he like

four<00:04:21.520> but<00:04:21.760> I<00:04:21.880> mean<00:04:22.150> I<00:04:22.240> figure<00:04:22.570> either<00:04:22.840> way<00:04:23.140> like

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:23.640 
four but I mean I figure either way like

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:25.490 
four but I mean I figure either way like
knuckle<00:04:24.640> as<00:04:24.880> shoe

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
knuckle as shoe

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.460 
knuckle as shoe
would<00:04:25.770> take<00:04:26.010> 101<00:04:26.640> and<00:04:26.850> gone<00:04:27.240> and<00:04:27.480> killer<00:04:27.840> would

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
would take 101 and gone and killer would

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.620 
would take 101 and gone and killer would
take<00:04:28.740> another<00:04:29.280> one<00:04:29.520> but<00:04:30.150> in<00:04:30.270> my<00:04:30.300> opinion

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
take another one but in my opinion

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.490 
take another one but in my opinion
there's<00:04:31.760> absolutely<00:04:32.760> no<00:04:33.420> way<00:04:33.450> that<00:04:33.780> any<00:04:34.350> of

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
there's absolutely no way that any of

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:36.290 
there's absolutely no way that any of
them<00:04:34.620> can<00:04:34.860> take<00:04:35.100> out<00:04:35.280> in<00:04:35.520> the<00:04:35.700> Royal<00:04:35.970> Guard

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
them can take out in the Royal Guard

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.660 
them can take out in the Royal Guard
it's<00:04:36.480> like<00:04:36.630> I<00:04:36.750> I<00:04:36.810> barely<00:04:37.350> see<00:04:37.650> that<00:04:37.860> anyways<00:04:38.370> in

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
it's like I I barely see that anyways in

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
it's like I I barely see that anyways in
general<00:04:39.300> so<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:40.670> just<00:04:41.670> really<00:04:41.970> don't<00:04:42.090> know<00:04:42.360> like

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
general so I just really don't know like

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.300 
general so I just really don't know like
they're<00:04:42.930> gonna<00:04:43.080> have<00:04:43.320> to<00:04:43.350> to<00:04:43.860> why<00:04:44.010> she's<00:04:44.190> gonna

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
they're gonna have to to why she's gonna

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.100 
they're gonna have to to why she's gonna
have<00:04:44.490> to<00:04:44.550> get<00:04:44.730> really<00:04:45.090> strategic<00:04:45.750> with<00:04:45.930> this

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.110 
have to get really strategic with this

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.500 
have to get really strategic with this
one<00:04:46.350> cuz<00:04:46.680> I'm<00:04:47.130> just<00:04:47.550> really<00:04:47.880> not<00:04:48.090> sure<00:04:48.150> how

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:48.510 
one cuz I'm just really not sure how

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:50.840 
one cuz I'm just really not sure how
this<00:04:48.720> is<00:04:48.900> even<00:04:49.020> remotely<00:04:49.530> possible<00:04:50.070> I<00:04:50.670> they'll

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
this is even remotely possible I they'll

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.950 
this is even remotely possible I they'll
even<00:04:51.090> think<00:04:51.690> that<00:04:51.750> and<00:04:52.670> we<00:04:53.670> also<00:04:53.880> get<00:04:54.630> to<00:04:54.750> see

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
even think that and we also get to see

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.909 
even think that and we also get to see
like<00:04:55.230> a<00:04:55.940> little<00:04:56.940> scene<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.390> with<00:04:57.840> the<00:04:58.410> Chairman

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919
