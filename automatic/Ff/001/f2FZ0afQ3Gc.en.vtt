00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
but I'm going to show you how to do it

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.610 
but I'm going to show you how to do it
what<00:00:41.280> we<00:00:41.370> care<00:00:41.550> about<00:00:41.579> is<00:00:41.879> the<00:00:42.030> g<00:00:42.300> ID<00:00:42.570> so<00:00:43.410> we<00:00:43.530> go

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
what we care about is the g ID so we go

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.470 
what we care about is the g ID so we go
over<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> teams<00:00:44.070> tab<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.610> we<00:00:44.969> can<00:00:45.090> compare

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
over the teams tab and we can compare

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.779 
over the teams tab and we can compare
the<00:00:45.600> g<00:00:45.750> ID<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.350> actual<00:00:46.680> teams<00:00:46.950> so<00:00:47.610> let's

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
the g ID to the actual teams so let's

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.540 
the g ID to the actual teams so let's
say<00:00:47.940> that<00:00:47.969> my<00:00:48.390> players<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.649> Celtics<00:00:50.340> and

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
Day and I believe that is all we have to

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:57.580 
Day and I believe that is all we have to
do<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:56.030> song's<00:03:56.240> color<00:03:56.540> doesn't<00:03:56.930> matter<00:03:57.260> and

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
do the song's color doesn't matter and

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.770 
do the song's color doesn't matter and
those<00:03:58.370> are<00:03:58.550> just<00:03:58.640> custom<00:03:59.060> colors<00:03:59.420> so<00:03:59.630> I<00:03:59.660> think

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
those are just custom colors so I think

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.310 
those are just custom colors so I think
this<00:04:00.080> is<00:04:00.230> it<00:04:00.640> so<00:04:01.640> now<00:04:01.910> we<00:04:02.600> will<00:04:02.780> be<00:04:02.900> able<00:04:03.050> to
