00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.290 

now<00:00:17.900> let's<00:00:18.140> look<00:00:18.230> at<00:00:18.380> reducing<00:00:18.830> fractions

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
now let's look at reducing fractions

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.050 
now let's look at reducing fractions
first<00:00:20.300> I<00:00:20.830> want<00:00:21.830> to<00:00:21.920> put<00:00:22.039> up<00:00:22.070> a<00:00:22.250> fraction<00:00:22.490> on<00:00:22.880> the

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
first I want to put up a fraction on the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.230 
first I want to put up a fraction on the
board<00:00:23.300> then<00:00:24.020> ask<00:00:24.289> you<00:00:24.380> a<00:00:24.470> question<00:00:25.090> can<00:00:26.090> this

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
board then ask you a question can this

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.870 
board then ask you a question can this
fraction<00:00:26.689> be<00:00:26.810> reduced<00:00:27.230> or<00:00:27.560> made<00:00:27.980> smaller<00:00:28.490> and

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
fraction be reduced or made smaller and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.250 
fraction be reduced or made smaller and
if<00:00:29.419> so<00:00:29.660> what<00:00:30.079> is<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.349> answer<00:00:31.509> yes<00:00:32.509> it<00:00:32.689> can<00:00:32.960> and

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
if so what is the answer yes it can and

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.380 
if so what is the answer yes it can and
the<00:00:33.680> answer<00:00:34.040> is<00:00:34.190> 3/4<00:00:36.670> ok<00:00:37.670> tell<00:00:38.030> us<00:00:38.059> what<00:00:38.269> you

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
the answer is 3/4 ok tell us what you

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.270 
the answer is 3/4 ok tell us what you
did<00:00:38.510> to<00:00:38.629> get<00:00:38.720> that<00:00:38.780> answer<00:00:39.260> I've<00:00:39.680> divided<00:00:40.100> the

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
did to get that answer I've divided the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.460 
did to get that answer I've divided the
top<00:00:40.489> and<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:40.790> bottom<00:00:40.910> of<00:00:41.210> the<00:00:41.300> fraction<00:00:41.540> by

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
top and the bottom of the fraction by

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.030 
top and the bottom of the fraction by
the<00:00:42.500> common<00:00:42.980> divisor<00:00:43.250> of<00:00:43.400> 3<00:00:43.730> to<00:00:44.000> get<00:00:44.150> 3<00:00:44.210> quarts

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.520 

yes<00:00:49.040> what<00:00:49.699> you<00:00:49.820> may<00:00:49.970> not<00:00:50.150> realize<00:00:50.210> is<00:00:51.140> that

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
yes what you may not realize is that

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.649 
yes what you may not realize is that
mentally<00:00:52.220> you<00:00:52.339> had<00:00:52.489> to<00:00:52.610> ask<00:00:52.760> yourself<00:00:53.210> if<00:00:53.479> the

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:53.659 
mentally you had to ask yourself if the

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:56.289 
mentally you had to ask yourself if the
numbers<00:00:54.019> 9<00:00:54.260> and<00:00:54.290> 12<00:00:54.890> had<00:00:55.580> a<00:00:55.610> common<00:00:56.180> number

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.299 
numbers 9 and 12 had a common number

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:58.479 
numbers 9 and 12 had a common number
that<00:00:56.629> you<00:00:56.780> could<00:00:56.960> divide<00:00:57.260> out<00:00:57.500> in<00:00:57.739> this

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
that you could divide out in this

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.729 
that you could divide out in this
fraction<00:00:59.030> both<00:00:59.210> 9<00:00:59.479> and<00:00:59.510> 12<00:00:59.960> could<00:01:00.290> be<00:01:00.409> divided

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:00.739 
fraction both 9 and 12 could be divided

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.060 
fraction both 9 and 12 could be divided
evenly<00:01:01.010> by<00:01:01.909> the<00:01:01.970> number<00:01:02.360> 3<00:01:02.769> so<00:01:03.769> you<00:01:03.830> could

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
evenly by the number 3 so you could

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.160 
evenly by the number 3 so you could
reduce<00:01:04.309> it<00:01:04.610> by<00:01:04.909> dividing<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.510> numerator<00:01:05.630> and

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
reduce it by dividing the numerator and

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.120 
reduce it by dividing the numerator and
a<00:01:06.260> denominator<00:01:06.290> by<00:01:06.979> 3<00:01:08.619> what<00:01:09.619> if<00:01:09.740> you<00:01:09.830> couldn't

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
a denominator by 3 what if you couldn't

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.710 
a denominator by 3 what if you couldn't
see<00:01:10.220> that<00:01:10.400> common<00:01:10.760> number<00:01:11.030> right<00:01:11.180> away<00:01:11.299> is

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720

denominator can be divided by three to

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.740 
denominator can be divided by three to
get<00:01:55.780> the<00:01:55.900> reduced<00:01:56.110> fraction<00:01:56.680> 3/4<00:02:00.510> let's<00:02:01.510> take

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
get the reduced fraction 3/4 let's take

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.350 
get the reduced fraction 3/4 let's take
another<00:02:01.900> example<00:02:02.680> in<00:02:03.340> the<00:02:03.430> fraction<00:02:03.880> fourteen

28 okay as you can see these numbers

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:40.740 
28 okay as you can see these numbers
have<00:02:34.209> three<00:02:34.510> common<00:02:35.020> numbers<00:02:35.410> -<00:02:36.070> 7<00:02:36.610> and<00:02:36.730> 14<00:02:39.750> so

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
have three common numbers - 7 and 14 so

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.440 
have three common numbers - 7 and 14 so
which<00:02:40.900> one<00:02:41.110> do<00:02:41.290> we<00:02:41.320> use<00:02:42.000> you'll<00:02:43.000> always<00:02:43.209> want

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
which one do we use you'll always want

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.660 
which one do we use you'll always want
to<00:02:43.600> use<00:02:43.810> a<00:02:43.840> largest<00:02:44.260> number<00:02:44.770> because<00:02:45.400> if<00:02:45.550> you

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
to use a largest number because if you

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.940 
to use a largest number because if you
don't<00:02:45.910> we<00:02:46.480> have<00:02:46.510> to<00:02:46.780> keep<00:02:46.959> reducing<00:02:47.200> it<00:02:47.680> until

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
don't we have to keep reducing it until

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.410 
don't we have to keep reducing it until
you<00:02:48.040> get<00:02:48.160> to<00:02:48.310> its<00:02:48.490> smallest<00:02:48.730> form<00:02:51.360> so<00:02:52.360> you

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
you get to its smallest form so you

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.790 
you get to its smallest form so you
divide<00:02:52.780> the<00:02:52.900> numerator<00:02:53.020> and<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.770> denominator

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
divide the numerator and a denominator

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.930 
divide the numerator and a denominator
by<00:02:54.550> 14<00:02:55.090> to<00:02:55.239> get<00:02:55.510> 1/2<00:02:58.830> correct<00:02:59.830> how<00:03:00.459> about<00:03:00.730> this

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
by 14 to get 1/2 correct how about this

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.540 
by 14 to get 1/2 correct how about this

as you can see xxx had quite a few
numbers<00:03:36.090> that<00:03:36.180> will<00:03:36.270> divide<00:03:36.510> evenly<00:03:36.690> into<00:03:37.110> it

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:37.380 
numbers that will divide evenly into it

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
let's take another example

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.590 
let's take another example
48<00:03:48.840> over<00:03:48.870> 64<00:03:49.800> now<00:03:50.520> these<00:03:50.670> are<00:03:50.850> large<00:03:51.060> numbers

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
and it wouldn't be a good idea to start

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.640 
and it wouldn't be a good idea to start
listing<00:03:54.090> all<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.450> numbers<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.870> go<00:03:55.080> evenly

into these two numbers ideally you want

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:59.630 
into these two numbers ideally you want

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.620 
me ask you a question can nine 16s be
reduced<00:04:51.720> if<00:04:52.320> so<00:04:52.740> what's<00:04:53.100> the<00:04:53.220> answer<00:04:53.490> if<00:04:54.180> not

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
reduced if so what's the answer if not

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.770 
reduced if so what's the answer if not
tell<00:04:55.110> me<00:04:55.290> why<00:04:56.480> let<00:04:57.480> me<00:04:57.660> think

00:04:59.770 --> 00:04:59.780 
tell me why let me think

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:05.240 
tell me why let me think
well<00:05:02.180> no<00:05:03.180> it<00:05:03.330> can't<00:05:03.600> be<00:05:03.780> reduced<00:05:03.930> that's<00:05:04.710> right

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
well no it can't be reduced that's right

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:07.100 
well no it can't be reduced that's right
now<00:05:05.550> explain<00:05:06.000> to<00:05:06.060> me<00:05:06.330> why<00:05:06.510> it<00:05:06.570> can't<00:05:06.960> be

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
now explain to me why it can't be

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:10.220 
now explain to me why it can't be
reduced<00:05:07.530> serving<00:05:07.860> 3<00:05:08.550> &amp;<00:05:08.760> 9<00:05:08.970> are<00:05:09.780> all<00:05:10.020> the

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:10.230 
reduced serving 3 &amp; 9 are all the

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:12.670 
reduced serving 3 &amp; 9 are all the
numbers<00:05:10.380> that<00:05:10.560> divide<00:05:10.770> evenly<00:05:11.280> tonight

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
numbers that divide evenly tonight

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.450 
numbers that divide evenly tonight
in<00:05:13.160> 2<00:05:13.460> 4<00:05:13.940> 8<00:05:14.419> and<00:05:14.960> 16<00:05:15.350> air<00:05:15.889> all<00:05:16.070> the<00:05:16.190> numbers

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
in 2 4 8 and 16 air all the numbers

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.270 
in 2 4 8 and 16 air all the numbers
divide<00:05:16.759> evenly<00:05:17.150> into<00:05:17.330> 16<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.770> as<00:05:18.949> you<00:05:19.130> can

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 
divide evenly into 16 and as you can

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.520 
divide evenly into 16 and as you can
plainly<00:05:19.490> see<00:05:19.790> there<00:05:20.389> are<00:05:20.540> no<00:05:20.690> common<00:05:21.139> numbers

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
plainly see there are no common numbers

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:25.090 
plainly see there are no common numbers
that<00:05:21.650> will<00:05:21.770> divide<00:05:21.830> evenly<00:05:22.250> into<00:05:22.520> 9<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.270> 16<00:05:24.100> so

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:25.100 
that will divide evenly into 9 and 16 so

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.659 
that will divide evenly into 9 and 16 so
9/16<00:05:26.030> is<00:05:26.120> already<00:05:26.539> the<00:05:26.780> smallest<00:05:27.080> form<00:05:27.669> that's

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
9/16 is already the smallest form that's

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:37.550 
9/16 is already the smallest form that's
correct

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.620
