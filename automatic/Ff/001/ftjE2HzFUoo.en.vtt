00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
seconds informant is the first test what

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.680 
seconds informant is the first test what
works<00:00:38.010> everything<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:38.610> look<00:00:38.820> at<00:00:38.969> this<00:00:39.059> object

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
works everything but look at this object

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.250 
works everything but look at this object
here<00:00:39.930> okay<00:00:40.890> here's<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.879> earth<00:00:42.149> here<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.050> this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
here okay here's the earth here is this

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.319 
here okay here's the earth here is this
object<00:00:43.530> near<00:00:44.040> Earth<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.700> up<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.180> is<00:00:45.300> a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
object near Earth this up here is a

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.420 
object near Earth this up here is a
clock<00:00:45.840> that's<00:00:45.870> reflected<00:00:46.829> as<00:00:46.980> made<00:00:47.250> to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
clock that's reflected as made to

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610 
clock that's reflected as made to
reflect<00:00:47.879> in<00:00:48.180> the<00:00:48.539> picture<00:00:48.930> but<00:00:49.079> apparently

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
reflect in the picture but apparently

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.590 
reflect in the picture but apparently
it's<00:00:49.710> not<00:00:49.800> working<00:00:50.160> here<00:00:50.370> so<00:00:51.000> it's<00:00:51.360> not<00:00:51.449> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
it's not working here so it's not the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.389 
it's not working here so it's not the
 much<00:00:52.399> what<00:00:53.399> this<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.789> no<00:00:54.420> that's<00:00:54.690> but

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
 much what this is no that's but

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:58.130 
 much what this is no that's but
it<00:00:56.399> looks<00:00:56.699> like<00:00:56.940> its<00:00:57.180> size<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.510> kind<00:00:58.020> of

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
it looks like its size and kind of

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.569 
it looks like its size and kind of
aircraft<00:00:59.059> then<00:01:00.059> go<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.109> next<00:01:01.289> one<00:01:01.579> that's

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
aircraft then go to the next one that's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.380

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
yeah there's an object in orbit of the

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.580 
yeah there's an object in orbit of the
mirror<00:02:28.569> one<00:02:29.349> mission<00:02:29.920> module<00:02:31.109> unusual<00:02:32.109> you

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
mirror one mission module unusual you
