00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.270
 hello guys then this will be a video 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.890
 a little particular particular name in the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.320
 sense of the type of video because it is 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.660
 sure of video applications has made them 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.700
 even a lot of it is not one of the original 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.460
 particular because why the product 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.279
 that I will show you today that I will try today 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.800
 with you we say but with you a spouse 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:27.300
 reality the soprano alone thing to say 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.820
 with you males and this arrives that rim 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.239
 of Dr. Frank who gave me 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.190
 very kind order when spent 49 lo 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.700
 score just under 40 euros for the 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:41.129
 urban decay electric scoop and a half 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.170
 precisely this sample except for the 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.539
 color uninviting we say that you me 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.000
 preceded in the non verdict sense 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.010
 scare you for the color reality will serve 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.390
 to all skin types on all types 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.600
 of skin and I have some doubts 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.850
 let's say I have a colorful genius then 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.879
 I can make it go well anyway 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.770
 color I call this almost see it 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:04.470
 there is a little more normal from the first less 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.600
 and more disturbing than sure and this 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.110
 heart here the horror is not for nothing 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.150
 also invite some colic because I say 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.890
 that are poured because when sent 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.619
 this sample I the first thing 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.110
 I thought it was a patrician video 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.900
 I think freely 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.820
 because for what time he made her a video 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.380
 I tell you today I have seen again I do not know 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.440
 how many times every time I perform with the 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.270
 tears and I swear they leave me 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:34.530
 obviously the link of the video because 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.540
 deserve to see in this video 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.270
 patrician the curtains speak does the review 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.260
 tool kit of Dr. 's products 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.580
 present of the trademark of this brand is 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:48.650
 in the part of elena way of telling 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.110
 the things there is really fantastic 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.540
 10p hard and chip inserted his is in the 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:58.470
 his story tells a certain point 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:01.800
 sorry for the repetition that at the alias age 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.990
 also the 176 youtube parts a certain point 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.960
 and said patrician but you never went 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.209
 to see his images on google 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:14.340
 who is this the brand as a thing 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.020
 face because I saw it because some 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.310
 of the products had not been found that 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.440
 even less, however, they are ready 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:24.720
 quite expensive indeed 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.570
 coldness says if I had seen the 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.890
 face of this doctor priest then 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:33.230
 he doesn't know how to see suffered hangs his 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:35.880
 biography but with the cabbage of the misa record 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.470
 for goodness sake will also have vall products 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.660
 d'en nobody you know in doubt 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.370
 however I can't do one 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.610
 Review of course the right account 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:47.160
 try it with you and I'll do it 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.950
 see the application of this bb 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.780
 cream and immediately I tell you my first 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.570
 impressions and that only these can say 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.709
 then maybe I think that with this 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:01.500
 sample I will be able to make a 4 5 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.600
 applications will be able to do them I should 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.330
 hurry up anyway other than a 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:09.060
 so they could dry up 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.530
 easily because then I would like to avoid 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.510
 to lose 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.250
 and in short, colorful where I feel 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.660
 still a little bit of color but then there is 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.660
 we will talk about the application later 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.150
 merit 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:14.849
 no I of the senses 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:25.560
 then you saw the app me 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.909
 in the video I don't show you let's say that 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.509
 just do not apply 

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:33.180
 the next incitement in powder month 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:35.729
 next which was or abundant 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.580
 because the night feeling the same with 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.500
 hands because 90 percent of the big ones 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.340
 rim has the best application with 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.020
 hands 

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:45.710
 I don't even think of being a 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.569
 brush because it was more produced 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.009
 precisely usually from those with hands 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:51.419
 and the best application 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.219
 in fact I have not been terribly ill 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.330
 but I don't apply to products with 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:56.330
 hands and this is another pair of sleeves 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:01.860
 so the feeling just lay was 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:06.180
 not at all pleasant because a lot 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:09.030
 I didn't like it, though 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:12.090
 I must say that in the end the final effect 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:17.280
 after applying the powder I do not 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:19.740
 mind at all though it passes coverage 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.569
 has discreetly fine-tuned 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:24.930
 actually the cola is not evil 

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:27.000
 even if a little darker than me it is 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.009
 and consider that they are reading me 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.090
 very lightly tanned if you have 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:36.060
 not the bike tan and you go 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:39.210
 bike knows what it means to 

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:41.280
 arms little legs at the signs of 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.770
 I knew about losing shoes 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.780
 I tell you that then he puts so much into 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.759
 Meanwhile I will publish from someone 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.090
 this video will have passed differently 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:53.699
 days the quota several times then vi 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:58.050
 invite you to read in the info box because there 

00:05:53.699 --> 00:06:00.570
 I will rewrite some other considerations 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.130
 today it's not particularly hot though 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:06.330
 however today at work 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:08.220
 I will have a great deal to do then then there 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.440
 I will be able to say more about the duration too 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.240
 on yield as it becomes above all 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.090
 when I saw natural light 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.270
 external because that too changes it 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.030
 mirror of cases one thing that is the 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:23.009
 natural light outside is something quite different and 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:24.360
 nothing is now a way for so much 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:26.789
 I invite you to go see the video of 

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:28.650
 patrician because she really made me 

00:06:26.789 --> 00:06:31.240
 you want to laugh and probably 

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:33.699
 in the preview you see my face 

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:35.860
 with the face of our brand next to it 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:39.090
 that I see a little ruined there 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:39.090
 surprise though 

00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.000
 just the inter has only a video like that 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.080
 keep her company I hope you have 

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:47.650
 ripped a smile I 'll see you at 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:47.650
 next video
