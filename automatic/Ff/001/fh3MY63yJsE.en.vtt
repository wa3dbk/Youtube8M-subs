00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.630
 although there are many daggers among 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.730
 military knives nowadays 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.800
 there are very few alternatives for a 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.480
 Real combat dagger is to be expected in 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.190
 the battlefield needs 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.720
 high quality tool with a 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.730
 hard construction of grace a price 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.679
 economic that gives a lot of confidence to the 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.259
 same time that its price does not restrict 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.090
 its use the spec series the show I am 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.429
 designed for that as polymer of 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.830
 mango uses creighton and is designed to 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.650
 ensure firm grip on all 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.630
 climatic conditions the sct 15 is a 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.370
 military dagger utility design that 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.530
 manages to have all the characteristics of 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.210
 a utility knife in a dagger the 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:44.949
 mango polymer is rigid but 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.989
 Anti-slip contrary to the 

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:48.940
 Most daggers and knives do not 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:50.730
 It has a circular or oval section 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.350
 but rectangular with the vertices 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.809
 rounded this gets you to grab a 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.879
 So slender handle is very safe due 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.530
 to which has four flat sides that 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:01.329
 they are very useful to ensure the 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.219
 orientation of the sheet since it is a 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.720
 dagger has a double handguard that 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.700
 blocks the sliding of the hand 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.560
 forward but also because 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.750
 the sheet has more than 10 millimeters of 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.310
 viola on both sides helps grab her 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.590
 very close to the edge 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.390
 is topped with an enlarged knob 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.520
 mushroom shape that ensures that the dagger 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.920
 It can be easily removed after 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.380
 pulsed and being metallic is even more 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.329
 useful to hit is topped with a 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.520
 Nylon dragonera that comes from factory 

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.979
 and it is very safe although it is not for court 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.259
 punching the knob would allow to use 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:33.909
 so that if it was possible to cross it with 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.039
 some patience the most attribute 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.140
 important of this long is the sheet that 

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:40.090
 in this case it is the clearest testimony 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.520
 of the utilitarian orientation of a dagger 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.530
 although it sounds contradictory to achieve 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.810
 an emery utility dagger or blade 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.850
 asymmetrically with a smooth edge 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.429
 main and a back with saws 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.289
 spacious topped with a contra-sharp 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.330
 passive at the tip that can be 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.310
 easily sharpened with a sharpener without 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:59.439
 need for a grinder despite the 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.899
 asymmetry of the excessive the tip of the 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.939
 dagger is corneal with the axis of the handle of 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.189
 such luck that the ability is preserved 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:08.140
 of pressed the cover of the spectra 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.479
 although it is very modest in its presentation 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.489
 It is extremely durable with a 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.950
 2 mm leather platform 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.500
 thickness and covered with nylon with double 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.620
 Seam structure and rivet with two 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.230
 buttons one of 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.540
 fast and a fixing strap of type 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:25.879
 aerial crew finishes it with a ring 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.099
 nylon with a leg-like cord 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.260
 the copy that we are reviewing is 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.360
 marked with a number two because ontario 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.310
 sells knives at a lower price 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.500
 with cosmetic imperfections what 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.239
 allows to have a very high knife 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.579
 quality at a price even more 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:41.870
 economic and that in cases like this is 

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.970
 very difficult to find 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.220
 imperfections what gives you still a 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:48.260
 higher standards spread level I 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.540
 its construction is supremely solid 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.609
 designed to cut to close and throw 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.250
 for work and combat in my 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:58.269
 opinion is the only design 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.269
 truly utilitarian of a dagger
