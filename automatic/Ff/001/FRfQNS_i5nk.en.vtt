they're<00:00:00.210> obstacle<00:00:00.989> course<00:00:01.970> yes<00:00:03.020> it's<00:00:04.020> got

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
they're obstacle course yes it's got

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.960 
they're obstacle course yes it's got
lots<00:00:04.859> of<00:00:05.220> obstacles<00:00:05.750> for<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:07.020> hamster<00:00:07.970> first

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
lots of obstacles for the hamster first

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:19.810 
lots of obstacles for the hamster first
a<00:00:09.389> hamster<00:00:10.050> runs<00:00:10.469> through<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.700> hamster<00:00:12.330> wraps

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.670 

then<00:00:20.820> he<00:00:21.300> comes<00:00:21.570> out<00:00:21.900> he<00:00:22.830> comes<00:00:23.100> out<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:23.939> path

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
then he comes out he comes out on a path

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:29.839 
then he comes out he comes out on a path
the<00:00:25.680> path<00:00:25.710> goes<00:00:26.430> up<00:00:27.349> he<00:00:28.349> is<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.920> raised<00:00:29.400> path

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
the path goes up he is on a raised path

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.150 
the path goes up he is on a raised path
now<00:00:30.949> that<00:00:31.949> path<00:00:32.309> leads<00:00:32.850> to<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.180> highway<00:00:34.100> yeah

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.819 

this<00:00:38.160> is<00:00:38.489> at<00:00:38.670> equal<00:00:39.180> three<00:00:39.540> as<00:00:40.320> he<00:00:40.500> slowly

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
this is at equal three as he slowly

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.400 
this is at equal three as he slowly
moves<00:00:41.309> across<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.149> high<00:00:42.300> wire<00:00:42.710> he<00:00:45.559> he<00:00:46.670> he<00:00:47.670> does

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
moves across the high wire he he he does

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:54.310 
moves across the high wire he he he does
balancing<00:00:49.410> acts<00:00:51.020> as<00:00:52.020> he<00:00:52.410> does<00:00:52.710> them<00:00:53.070> he<00:00:53.879> stops

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
balancing acts as he does them he stops

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.250 
balancing acts as he does them he stops
he<00:00:55.320> is<00:00:55.500> about<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.920> fall<00:00:57.859> folks<00:00:59.180> or<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.930> temp

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
he is about to fall folks or is the temp

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.679 
he is about to fall folks or is the temp
he<00:01:02.070> tipped<00:01:02.989> 10<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.589> way<00:01:04.979> then<00:01:05.670> on<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.240> blitz

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
he tipped 10 this way then on to blitz

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.020 
he tipped 10 this way then on to blitz
and<00:01:07.260> onto<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.740> black<00:01:08.520> hole<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.990> blue<00:01:11.030> platform

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
and onto a black hole the blue platform

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.420 
and onto a black hole the blue platform
has<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:12.960> path<00:01:13.439> on<00:01:13.950> it<00:01:14.280> okay<00:01:15.119> as<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:16.140> see<00:01:16.439> me

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
has a path on it okay as you see me

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:27.649 
has a path on it okay as you see me
another<00:01:18.270> path<00:01:19.490> is<00:01:21.020> obstacle<00:01:22.670> by<00:01:26.360> the<00:01:27.360> bath

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
another path is obstacle by the bath

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.880 
another path is obstacle by the bath
raises<00:01:28.759> that<00:01:29.759> another<00:01:30.270> race<00:01:30.689> path<00:01:31.140> is

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
raises that another race path is

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.719 
raises that another race path is
obstacle<00:01:32.579> six<00:01:34.880> finally<00:01:35.880> ops<00:01:36.240> 2<00:01:36.659> 7<00:01:37.729> another

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
obstacle six finally ops 2 7 another

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.520 
obstacle six finally ops 2 7 another
tippy<00:01:39.420> that<00:01:40.140> is<00:01:40.439> thinner<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:41.640> it<00:01:42.150> tips<00:01:42.930> and

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
tippy that is thinner as it tips and

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.630 
tippy that is thinner as it tips and
then<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.430> tips<00:01:44.790> back<00:01:44.970> onto<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:46.640> this

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
then it tips back onto this this

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.340 
then it tips back onto this this
actually<00:01:48.270> tips<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.560> changes<00:01:50.189> direction

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
actually tips and that changes direction

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.050 
actually tips and that changes direction
slides<00:01:52.350> it<00:01:52.710> took<00:01:53.460> and<00:01:53.729> slides<00:01:54.240> it<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.500> red

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
slides it took and slides it to this red

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.300 
slides it took and slides it to this red
that's<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.420> end<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.079> hamster<00:01:58.649> obstacle

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that's the end of the hamster obstacle

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.350 
that's the end of the hamster obstacle
