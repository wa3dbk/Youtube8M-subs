00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
243 pounds so the question is can he

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.109 
243 pounds so the question is can he

talk about that in our next report at

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.289 
talk about that in our next report at
the<00:01:42.689> inside<00:01:43.079> linebacker<00:01:43.220> position<00:01:44.220> given<00:01:45.180> his

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
the inside linebacker position given his

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.870 
the inside linebacker position given his
size<00:01:45.540> at<00:01:45.780> 243<00:01:46.470> pounds<00:01:46.680> you<00:01:47.369> would<00:01:47.490> logically

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
size at 243 pounds you would logically

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.899 
size at 243 pounds you would logically
think<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.780> George<00:01:49.470> could<00:01:49.799> play<00:01:50.009> inside<00:01:50.549> but

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
think that George could play inside but

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.270 
think that George could play inside but
the<00:01:51.299> way<00:01:51.479> he<00:01:51.720> plays<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.290> his<00:01:52.439> style<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.189> his

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
the way he plays in his style and his

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.870 
the way he plays in his style and his
his<00:01:53.880> ability<00:01:54.420> on<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.290> edge<00:01:55.470> he<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.340> is<00:01:56.640> an

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
his ability on the edge he really is an

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.880 
his ability on the edge he really is an
outside<00:01:57.509> linebacker<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.500> he's<00:01:58.619> going<00:01:58.710> to<00:01:58.770> be

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
outside linebacker so he's going to be

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.179 
outside linebacker so he's going to be
on<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.159> strong<00:01:59.579> side<00:02:00.000> for<00:02:00.390> BYU<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:01.259> I

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
on that strong side for BYU and I

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:04.670 
on that strong side for BYU and I
suspect<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:02.880> he's<00:02:03.119> going<00:02:03.360> to<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:04.259> real

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.760 
contributor and you're going to see a
real<00:02:06.000> step<00:02:06.299> up<00:02:06.509> from<00:02:06.689> what<00:02:06.780> he<00:02:07.049> did<00:02:07.079> last<00:02:07.259> year

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
four he's listed at 209 but I think that

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.540

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
I would say he's probably about 225

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.290 
I would say he's probably about 225
maybe<00:02:36.819> even<00:02:37.030> 230<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:38.500> when<00:02:39.099> you<00:02:39.190> see<00:02:39.400> Kyle<00:02:39.700> you

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
maybe even 230 and when you see Kyle you

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:42.000 
maybe even 230 and when you see Kyle you
immediately<00:02:40.870> there's<00:02:41.140> another<00:02:41.410> guy<00:02:41.680> that<00:02:41.709> you

the fact that he sat out last year

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.080 
the fact that he sat out last year
because<00:02:54.310> of<00:02:54.870> his<00:02:55.870> DUI<00:02:56.610> and<00:02:57.610> the<00:02:57.670> fact<00:02:57.970> that

expect him to he will push for that
starting<00:03:27.940> strong-side<00:03:28.900> and<00:03:29.470> he's<00:03:29.920> somebody

and that's a Lani fool who could be an

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.860 
and that's a Lani fool who could be an
outside<00:04:32.380> linebacker<00:04:32.650> prospect<00:04:33.190> and<00:04:33.880> was

outside linebacker prospect and was

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.100

listed as that being recruited as he

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:41.490 
listed as that being recruited as he
signed<00:04:38.410> this<00:04:38.650> past<00:04:39.220> februari<00:04:39.820> very<00:04:40.810> athletic

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
signed this past februari very athletic

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:45.960 
signed this past februari very athletic
and<00:04:41.790> he<00:04:42.790> has<00:04:43.090> genes<00:04:44.010> that<00:04:45.010> might<00:04:45.580> tell<00:04:45.820> you

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
and he has genes that might tell you

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.250 
and he has genes that might tell you
that<00:04:46.150> he's<00:04:46.270> going<00:04:46.420> to<00:04:46.510> put<00:04:46.720> on<00:04:46.810> some<00:04:47.110> weight

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
that he's going to put on some weight

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.470 
that he's going to put on some weight
and<00:04:47.320> get<00:04:47.770> bigger<00:04:48.100> and<00:04:48.610> so<00:04:48.970> we<00:04:49.240> probably

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:49.480 
and get bigger and so we probably

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.210 
and get bigger and so we probably
eventually<00:04:49.720> see<00:04:50.140> him<00:04:50.350> on<00:04:50.470> the<00:04:50.590> defensive<00:04:50.800> line

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
eventually see him on the defensive line

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.620 
eventually see him on the defensive line
his<00:04:51.580> brother<00:04:51.820> plays<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:53.290> defensive<00:04:53.740> line<00:04:53.770> at

his brother plays the defensive line at
at<00:04:55.630> Stanford<00:04:56.290> so<00:04:56.560> and<00:04:57.430> given<00:04:58.180> just<00:04:58.480> looking<00:04:58.750> at

at Stanford so and given just looking at
his<00:04:59.050> dad<00:04:59.320> and<00:04:59.680> his<00:04:59.860> brother<00:05:00.390> alani<00:05:01.390> is

his dad and his brother alani is

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.360 
his dad and his brother alani is
probably<00:05:01.720> going<00:05:01.840> to<00:05:01.900> put<00:05:02.110> on<00:05:02.230> some<00:05:02.530> weight<00:05:03.310> and

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
fill out over time and probably end up

on<00:05:05.290> the<00:05:05.380> defensive<00:05:05.830> line<00:05:05.920> but<00:05:06.580> as<00:05:06.640> a<00:05:06.700> freshman

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
on the defensive line but as a freshman

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.480 
on the defensive line but as a freshman
a<00:05:07.270> guy<00:05:07.540> who<00:05:07.600> could<00:05:07.840> come<00:05:08.080> in<00:05:08.260> and<00:05:08.440> one<00:05:09.310> of<00:05:09.370> those

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
a guy who could come in and one of those

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.040 
a guy who could come in and one of those
few<00:05:09.700> freshman<00:05:10.150> that<00:05:10.240> could<00:05:10.420> make<00:05:10.600> an<00:05:10.720> impact

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
few freshman that could make an impact

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.140 
few freshman that could make an impact
would<00:05:11.260> be<00:05:11.290> alani<00:05:12.130> foo<00:05:12.400> if<00:05:12.580> something<00:05:12.970> were<00:05:13.090> to

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
would be alani foo if something were to

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.540 
would be alani foo if something were to
happen<00:05:13.270> to<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.830> first<00:05:15.070> three<00:05:15.310> that<00:05:15.460> we've

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:15.550 
happen to the first three that we've

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.670 
happen to the first three that we've
talked<00:05:15.850> about<00:05:16.000> so<00:05:16.810> that's<00:05:16.900> a<00:05:17.050> look<00:05:17.170> at<00:05:17.410> your

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
talked about so that's a look at your

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.730 
talked about so that's a look at your
outside<00:05:18.160> linebackers<00:05:19.030> I<00:05:19.690> really<00:05:20.350> do<00:05:20.470> think

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 
outside linebackers I really do think

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:22.500 
outside linebackers I really do think
that<00:05:20.860> the<00:05:21.370> defense<00:05:21.760> is<00:05:21.880> going<00:05:22.060> to<00:05:22.120> change<00:05:22.180> a

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
that the defense is going to change a

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:27.720 
that the defense is going to change a
little<00:05:22.600> bit<00:05:22.750> for<00:05:22.960> BYU<00:05:24.270> not<00:05:25.270> so<00:05:25.510> much<00:05:26.730> playing

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:27.730 
little bit for BYU not so much playing

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.330 
little bit for BYU not so much playing
off<00:05:28.000> I<00:05:28.240> think<00:05:28.510> with<00:05:28.660> the<00:05:28.840> experience<00:05:29.650> that<00:05:29.980> the

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
off I think with the experience that the

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.400 
off I think with the experience that the
front<00:05:30.580> seven<00:05:30.910> is<00:05:31.030> going<00:05:31.270> to<00:05:31.390> have<00:05:31.570> behind<00:05:32.080> them

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
front seven is going to have behind them

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.980 
front seven is going to have behind them
in<00:05:32.770> the<00:05:33.430> defensive<00:05:33.910> secondary<00:05:34.450> and<00:05:34.720> I<00:05:34.750> think

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
in the defensive secondary and I think

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.780 
in the defensive secondary and I think
with<00:05:35.080> some<00:05:35.140> of<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.440> success<00:05:35.860> that<00:05:36.280> you<00:05:36.580> saw

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:36.790 
with some of the success that you saw

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.520 
with some of the success that you saw
with<00:05:37.360> the<00:05:37.450> Cougars<00:05:37.750> playing<00:05:38.050> some<00:05:38.260> pressure

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
with the Cougars playing some pressure

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.350 
with the Cougars playing some pressure
against<00:05:38.950> Oregon<00:05:39.370> State<00:05:39.670> late<00:05:39.910> in<00:05:40.030> the<00:05:40.120> season

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:40.360 
against Oregon State late in the season

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.180 
against Oregon State late in the season
early<00:05:41.320> in<00:05:41.410> the<00:05:41.530> season<00:05:41.710> they<00:05:41.890> had<00:05:41.980> some

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
early in the season they had some

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.870 
early in the season they had some
success<00:05:42.610> with<00:05:42.730> that<00:05:42.900> and<00:05:44.100> in<00:05:45.100> blitzing<00:05:45.730> and

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:45.880 
success with that and in blitzing and

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.550 
success with that and in blitzing and
bringing<00:05:46.150> some<00:05:46.330> pressure<00:05:46.630> against<00:05:46.990> Oklahoma

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
bringing some pressure against Oklahoma

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.920 
bringing some pressure against Oklahoma
and<00:05:47.980> so<00:05:48.910> I<00:05:48.940> think<00:05:49.060> you're<00:05:49.360> going<00:05:49.600> to<00:05:49.780> actually

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
and so I think you're going to actually

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:52.950 
and so I think you're going to actually
see<00:05:50.440> BYU<00:05:50.860> be<00:05:51.580> a<00:05:51.790> lot<00:05:52.060> more<00:05:52.090> aggressive<00:05:52.810> on

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
see BYU be a lot more aggressive on

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.920 
see BYU be a lot more aggressive on
defense<00:05:52.990> and<00:05:53.830> a<00:05:54.670> lot<00:05:54.850> of<00:05:54.880> that<00:05:55.030> has<00:05:55.210> to<00:05:55.240> do<00:05:55.570> with

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
defense and a lot of that has to do with

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.080 
defense and a lot of that has to do with
an<00:05:56.530> upgrade<00:05:56.920> and<00:05:57.040> athleticism<00:05:57.520> at<00:05:57.970> the

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.090 
an upgrade and athleticism at the

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.880 
an upgrade and athleticism at the
ability<00:05:58.600> to<00:05:58.690> put<00:05:58.900> pressure<00:05:59.170> on<00:05:59.470> the

00:05:59.880 --> 00:05:59.890 
ability to put pressure on the

00:05:59.890 --> 00:06:02.070 
ability to put pressure on the
quarterback<00:06:00.070> of<00:06:00.640> the<00:06:00.670> d-line<00:06:01.090> and<00:06:01.390> at<00:06:01.900> the

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
quarterback of the d-line and at the

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.540 
quarterback of the d-line and at the
linebacker<00:06:02.530> position<00:06:03.130> especially<00:06:03.280> the
