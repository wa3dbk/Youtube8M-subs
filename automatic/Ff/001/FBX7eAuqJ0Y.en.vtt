hi<00:00:00.480> everyone<00:00:00.780> in<00:00:00.960> this<00:00:00.989> video<00:00:01.260> we<00:00:01.650> are<00:00:01.800> looking

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
hi everyone in this video we are looking

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.650 
hi everyone in this video we are looking
at<00:00:02.520> the<00:00:02.820> Nick<00:00:03.090> horn<00:00:03.360> 50<00:00:03.929> mil<00:00:04.110> if<00:00:04.440> 1.4<00:00:05.400> AF<00:00:06.029> deal

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
at the Nick horn 50 mil if 1.4 AF deal

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.799 
at the Nick horn 50 mil if 1.4 AF deal
in<00:00:06.990> so<00:00:07.410> it's<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.589> old<00:00:07.849> version<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.000> we're

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
in so it's the old version and we're

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.540 
in so it's the old version and we're
looking<00:00:10.080> at<00:00:10.170> is<00:00:10.380> performance<00:00:11.010> on<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> full

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
looking at is performance on a full

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.169 
looking at is performance on a full
frame<00:00:11.910> camera<00:00:11.969> I'm<00:00:12.599> shooting<00:00:13.139> with<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.349> Nikon

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:14.179 
frame camera I'm shooting with the Nikon

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.140 
frame camera I'm shooting with the Nikon
d700<00:00:15.179> at<00:00:15.660> ISO<00:00:16.650> 800<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.609> we're<00:00:17.850> going<00:00:18.029> through

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
d700 at ISO 800 and we're going through

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.880 
d700 at ISO 800 and we're going through
the<00:00:18.270> different<00:00:18.420> apertures<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.199> look<00:00:19.619> at<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the different apertures to look at the

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.939 
the different apertures to look at the
center<00:00:20.310> sharpness<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.390> outer<00:00:21.769> sharpness<00:00:22.769> and

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
center sharpness the outer sharpness and

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.189 
center sharpness the outer sharpness and
also<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.640> vignetting<00:00:24.060> that<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.420> get<00:00:24.600> when

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
also the vignetting that you get when

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.109 
also the vignetting that you get when
you<00:00:25.320> go<00:00:25.470> there<00:00:25.680> what<00:00:26.220> I'm<00:00:26.400> taking<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.699> short<00:00:26.939> of

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
you go there what I'm taking a short of

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.980 
you go there what I'm taking a short of
is<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.779> brick<00:00:28.140> wall<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.710> my<00:00:28.890> house<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.990> my

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
is a brick wall in my house and my

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.690 
is a brick wall in my house and my
parents<00:00:31.140> house<00:00:31.410> and<00:00:31.650> we're<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.369> to<00:00:32.430> look<00:00:32.520> at

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
parents house and we're going to look at

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.700 
parents house and we're going to look at
the<00:00:32.759> photos<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.360> think<00:00:33.780> we<00:00:34.020> did<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.260> at<00:00:34.530> one

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
the photos I think we did it at one

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.900 
the photos I think we did it at one
point<00:00:34.920> 4<00:00:35.670> F<00:00:36.030> 2<00:00:36.090> F<00:00:36.600> 2<00:00:36.630> point<00:00:36.960> 8<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.290> so<00:00:37.860> on<00:00:37.910> so

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
point 4 F 2 F 2 point 8 and so on so

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.240 
point 4 F 2 F 2 point 8 and so on so
here<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> first<00:00:39.809> shot<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.559> that<00:00:40.860> if<00:00:41.040> one

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
here was the first shot is that if one

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.950 
here was the first shot is that if one
point<00:00:41.489> four<00:00:41.670> so<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:41.910> straight<00:00:42.270> off<00:00:42.450> looking<00:00:42.840> at

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
point four so it straight off looking at

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.869 
point four so it straight off looking at
that<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.140> can<00:00:43.290> definitely<00:00:43.500> see<00:00:43.980> that<00:00:44.219> there's

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
that you can definitely see that there's

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.000 
that you can definitely see that there's
some<00:00:45.090> vignetting<00:00:45.450> going<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:46.020> at<00:00:46.440> the<00:00:46.620> corner

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
some vignetting going up at the corner

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.250 
some vignetting going up at the corner
it<00:00:47.250> also<00:00:47.430> looks<00:00:47.730> like<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.120> be<00:00:48.210> pretty<00:00:48.539> soft<00:00:48.960> up

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
it also looks like you be pretty soft up

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.959 
it also looks like you be pretty soft up
there<00:00:49.530> as<00:00:49.620> well<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.270> so<00:00:51.270> if<00:00:51.510> we<00:00:51.690> zoom<00:00:52.230> in

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
there as well and so if we zoom in

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.090 
there as well and so if we zoom in
Center<00:00:53.969> stuff<00:00:54.390> looks<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.320> little<00:00:55.469> bit<00:00:55.770> soft

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
Center stuff looks a little bit soft

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.180 
Center stuff looks a little bit soft
down<00:00:56.640> there<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.210> well<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:58.260> up<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.649> corner

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
down there as well but up in the corner

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.490 
down there as well but up in the corner
you've<00:00:59.579> seen<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.149> definitely<00:01:00.809> dark<00:01:01.050> and<00:01:01.320> it's

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
you've seen is definitely dark and it's

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.140 
you've seen is definitely dark and it's
pretty<00:01:01.859> pretty<00:01:02.760> soft<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.660> terms<00:01:03.930> of

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
pretty pretty soft but in terms of

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.399 
pretty pretty soft but in terms of
absolute<00:01:06.150> Center<00:01:06.570> sharpness<00:01:06.960> it's<00:01:07.080> not<00:01:07.229> too

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
absolute Center sharpness it's not too

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.240 
absolute Center sharpness it's not too
bad<00:01:07.590> at<00:01:07.860> F<00:01:08.130> 1.4<00:01:08.990> if<00:01:09.990> we<00:01:10.200> go<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.470> the<00:01:10.830> next<00:01:11.100> one

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
bad at F 1.4 if we go to the next one

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.420 
bad at F 1.4 if we go to the next one
which<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.880> at<00:01:12.360> F<00:01:12.630> 2<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.560> can<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.830> an<00:01:13.950> instant

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
which is at F 2 you can see an instant

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.810 
which is at F 2 you can see an instant
change<00:01:14.520> in<00:01:15.500> the<00:01:16.500> outer<00:01:17.070> brightness<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
change in the outer brightness of the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.910 
change in the outer brightness of the
vignetting<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.659> get<00:01:18.869> with<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.680> lens

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
vignetting that you get with the lens

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.120 
vignetting that you get with the lens
and<00:01:20.450> again<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.630> you<00:01:21.689> go<00:01:21.780> up<00:01:21.840> to<00:01:21.900> F<00:01:22.020> 2.8<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.860> even

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and again if you go up to F 2.8 is even

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.420 
and again if you go up to F 2.8 is even
brighter<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.759> then<00:01:24.390> at<00:01:24.630> f/4<00:01:25.280> suddenly<00:01:26.280> the

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
brighter and then at f/4 suddenly the

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.760 
brighter and then at f/4 suddenly the
whole<00:01:26.640> image<00:01:27.450> that's<00:01:27.630> really<00:01:28.080> really<00:01:28.500> sharp

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
whole image that's really really sharp

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.700 
whole image that's really really sharp
so<00:01:29.070> if<00:01:29.579> we<00:01:29.640> go<00:01:29.759> down<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:30.090> F<00:01:30.390> two<00:01:30.990> point<00:01:31.259> two

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
so if we go down to F two point two

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.640 
so if we go down to F two point two
point<00:01:31.950> zero<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.659> again<00:01:33.659> they<00:01:34.350> said<00:01:34.530> we<00:01:34.619> just

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
point zero and again they said we just

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.840 
point zero and again they said we just
focus<00:01:35.070> right<00:01:35.280> at<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.430> center<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.400> go<00:01:38.610> from

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
focus right at the center and we go from

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.740 
focus right at the center and we go from
F<00:01:39.390> 1<00:01:40.290> point<00:01:40.530> 4<00:01:40.740> 2<00:01:41.430> F<00:01:41.549> 2<00:01:41.579> you<00:01:42.000> can<00:01:42.180> see<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> big

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
F 1 point 4 2 F 2 you can see a big

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.410 
F 1 point 4 2 F 2 you can see a big
increase<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.409> sharpness<00:01:44.070> there<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:45.360> if

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
increase in sharpness there and then if

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.960 
increase in sharpness there and then if
we<00:01:45.479> go<00:01:45.570> to<00:01:45.600> 2.8<00:01:46.200> I<00:01:46.560> would<00:01:47.009> say<00:01:47.310> is<00:01:47.610> pretty

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
we go to 2.8 I would say is pretty

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.090 
we go to 2.8 I would say is pretty
difficult<00:01:48.360> to<00:01:48.810> tell<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.409> an<00:01:49.680> increase<00:01:49.950> in

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
difficult to tell of an increase in

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.980 
difficult to tell of an increase in
sharpness<00:01:50.579> now<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:50.939> was<00:01:51.240> doing<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.570> handheld

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
sharpness now I was doing this handheld

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.870 
sharpness now I was doing this handheld
so<00:01:52.380> there<00:01:52.530> might<00:01:52.649> be<00:01:52.680> some<00:01:52.770> tiny<00:01:53.189> variations

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
so there might be some tiny variations

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.719 
so there might be some tiny variations
in<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:55.079> sharpness<00:01:55.470> from<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.219> distance<00:01:56.640> that

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
in the sharpness from the distance that

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.130 
in the sharpness from the distance that
I<00:01:56.790> was<00:01:57.060> from<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.689> wall<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.850> f4<00:01:59.850> and<00:02:00.210> then<00:02:00.600> yet

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
I was from the wall and f4 and then yet

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.170 
I was from the wall and f4 and then yet
so<00:02:01.409> did<00:02:01.829> up<00:02:01.979> to<00:02:02.070> f4<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:04.880> that's<00:02:05.880> looking

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
so did up to f4 and that's looking

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.880 
so did up to f4 and that's looking
pretty<00:02:06.420> darn<00:02:06.630> sharp<00:02:06.840> let's<00:02:07.259> go<00:02:07.469> up<00:02:07.710> to<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
pretty darn sharp let's go up to the

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.940 
pretty darn sharp let's go up to the
corners<00:02:08.340> here<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.569> even<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.050> very<00:02:10.349> corners

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
corners here so even in the very corners

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.059 
corners here so even in the very corners
at<00:02:11.099> a<00:02:11.459> 4

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
at a 4

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.819 
at a 4
it's<00:02:12.549> not<00:02:12.730> looking<00:02:12.909> super<00:02:13.749> sharp<00:02:14.170> mind<00:02:14.709> you

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:14.829 
it's not looking super sharp mind you

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.080 
it's not looking super sharp mind you
you're<00:02:14.980> not<00:02:15.099> really<00:02:15.249> gonna<00:02:15.459> be<00:02:15.579> looking<00:02:15.969> at

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
you're not really gonna be looking at

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.199 
you're not really gonna be looking at
this<00:02:16.180> point<00:02:16.480> for<00:02:17.609> for<00:02:18.609> this<00:02:18.730> type<00:02:18.909> of<00:02:18.939> lens

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
this point for for this type of lens

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.550 
this point for for this type of lens
this<00:02:19.450> you've<00:02:19.719> probably<00:02:19.870> go<00:02:20.049> to<00:02:20.109> more<00:02:20.379> likely

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
this you've probably go to more likely

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.789 
this you've probably go to more likely
be<00:02:20.769> looking<00:02:21.069> at<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:22.209> kind<00:02:22.930> of<00:02:22.959> center<00:02:23.409> focus

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:23.799 
be looking at the kind of center focus

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:30.559 
be looking at the kind of center focus
but<00:02:24.400> here<00:02:24.549> F<00:02:24.730> 2.8<00:02:25.329> really<00:02:26.170> pretty<00:02:26.439> blurry<00:02:27.540> if

00:02:30.559 --> 00:02:30.569 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.240 

2.0<00:02:31.569> mm<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:33.069> then<00:02:33.340> last<00:02:33.730> one<00:02:34.739> you<00:02:35.739> can<00:02:35.829> see<00:02:36.129> it

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
2.0 mm and then last one you can see it

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.670 
2.0 mm and then last one you can see it
there<00:02:36.519> is<00:02:37.019> yeah<00:02:38.040> not<00:02:39.040> that<00:02:39.069> great<00:02:39.700> and<00:02:40.079> so<00:02:41.079> if

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
there is yeah not that great and so if

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.280 
there is yeah not that great and so if
we<00:02:41.799> look<00:02:41.919> at<00:02:41.950> brightness<00:02:42.519> here<00:02:42.819> so<00:02:43.120> that's<00:02:43.329> 1.4

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
we look at brightness here so that's 1.4

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.429 
we look at brightness here so that's 1.4
f<00:02:44.650> to<00:02:45.599> 2.8<00:02:46.980> f4<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.430> a<00:02:48.989> substantial<00:02:49.989> increase<00:02:50.319> in

00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:50.439 
f to 2.8 f4 so a substantial increase in

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:50.970 
f to 2.8 f4 so a substantial increase in
brightness

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
brightness

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.659 
brightness
so<00:02:51.280> if<00:02:51.699> 1.4<00:02:52.180> you<00:02:52.269> get<00:02:52.419> a<00:02:52.449> strong<00:02:52.780> vignette

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:53.669 
so if 1.4 you get a strong vignette

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:57.030 
so if 1.4 you get a strong vignette
Center<00:02:54.669> wise<00:02:54.879> okay<00:02:55.780> Center<00:02:56.290> wise<00:02:56.469> brightness

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
Center wise okay Center wise brightness

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.640 
Center wise okay Center wise brightness
there's<00:02:58.000> not<00:02:58.329> a<00:02:58.629> huge<00:02:59.169> increase<00:02:59.530> in

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
there's not a huge increase in

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.250 
there's not a huge increase in
brightness<00:03:00.159> whatsoever<00:03:00.879> so<00:03:01.599> that's<00:03:01.840> good<00:03:02.079> so

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
brightness whatsoever so that's good so

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.289 
brightness whatsoever so that's good so
the<00:03:02.379> center<00:03:02.739> is<00:03:02.769> always<00:03:03.040> roughly<00:03:03.639> exactly<00:03:04.209> the

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
the center is always roughly exactly the

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.229 
the center is always roughly exactly the
same<00:03:04.510> exposure<00:03:05.349> and<00:03:06.030> sharpness<00:03:07.030> does

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
same exposure and sharpness does

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.740 
same exposure and sharpness does
definitely<00:03:07.659> increase<00:03:08.230> from<00:03:08.980> if<00:03:09.510> one<00:03:10.510> point

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
definitely increase from if one point

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.199 
definitely increase from if one point
for<00:03:11.019> not<00:03:11.709> being<00:03:11.889> the<00:03:12.010> sharpest<00:03:12.400> to<00:03:12.549> f/2<00:03:12.969> is

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
for not being the sharpest to f/2 is

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.420 
for not being the sharpest to f/2 is
looking<00:03:14.079> pretty<00:03:14.260> darn<00:03:14.409> good<00:03:14.829> it<00:03:15.010> looks<00:03:15.189> about

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
looking pretty darn good it looks about

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.449 
looking pretty darn good it looks about
as<00:03:15.489> good<00:03:16.120> as<00:03:16.269> it's<00:03:16.419> gonna<00:03:16.509> get<00:03:16.949> but<00:03:17.949> probably

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
as good as it's gonna get but probably

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.240 
as good as it's gonna get but probably
if<00:03:19.120> you're<00:03:19.299> wanting<00:03:19.989> to<00:03:20.049> get<00:03:20.229> it<00:03:20.409> so<00:03:20.560> short<00:03:20.949> all

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
if you're wanting to get it so short all

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.800 
if you're wanting to get it so short all
the<00:03:21.430> way<00:03:21.489> to<00:03:21.549> the<00:03:21.729> edges<00:03:21.909> with<00:03:22.239> as<00:03:22.419> little

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
the way to the edges with as little

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.659 
the way to the edges with as little
vignette<00:03:23.139> as<00:03:23.349> possible<00:03:23.769> but<00:03:24.189> we<00:03:24.280> got<00:03:24.430> to<00:03:24.519> go<00:03:24.609> to

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:24.669 
vignette as possible but we got to go to

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:27.119 
vignette as possible but we got to go to
f4<00:03:25.269> and<00:03:25.479> above<00:03:26.049> when<00:03:26.470> you're<00:03:26.620> using<00:03:26.799> it<00:03:26.979> with<00:03:27.009> a

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
full frame camera like the Nikon d700

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.699 
full frame camera like the Nikon d700
okay<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:31.269> that's<00:03:31.509> a<00:03:31.780> little<00:03:32.019> healthy<00:03:32.379> cheers
