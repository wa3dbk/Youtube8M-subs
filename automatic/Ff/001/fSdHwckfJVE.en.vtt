00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.710 
right off and the good thing about the
back<00:03:09.700> is<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:09.970> doesn't<00:03:10.239> attract<00:03:10.540> all<00:03:10.690> the

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
back is it doesn't attract all the

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.839 
back is it doesn't attract all the
fingerprints<00:03:11.200> I<00:03:11.349> get<00:03:11.500> used<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.860> I<00:03:12.040> mean<00:03:12.730> it

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
fingerprints I get used to I mean it

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.009

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
attracts some but you can't see it also

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.099 
attracts some but you can't see it also
another<00:03:17.290> thing<00:03:17.470> I<00:03:17.739> found<00:03:18.010> is<00:03:18.690> you<00:03:19.690> really<00:03:19.900> have

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
another thing I found is you really have

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.349 
another thing I found is you really have
to<00:03:20.230> push<00:03:20.470> in<00:03:20.709> the<00:03:20.739> middle<00:03:21.160> when<00:03:21.310> you<00:03:21.340> doing<00:03:22.269> the

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
to push in the middle when you doing the

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:24.270 
to push in the middle when you doing the
low<00:03:22.510> loop<00:03:22.750> button<00:03:22.989> so<00:03:23.680> if<00:03:23.739> you<00:03:23.859> push<00:03:24.040> on<00:03:24.160> the

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
low loop button so if you push on the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.190 
low loop button so if you push on the
side<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.700> get<00:03:25.359> stuck<00:03:25.630> and<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.870> won't<00:03:26.019> go<00:03:26.170> down

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
side it get stuck and it won't go down

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.289 
side it get stuck and it won't go down
so<00:03:27.040> you<00:03:27.100> really<00:03:27.280> have<00:03:27.430> to<00:03:27.549> push<00:03:27.819> in<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.030> middle

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
so you really have to push in the middle

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:31.710 
so you really have to push in the middle

bigger you can see with this the screen
is<00:04:13.269> a<00:04:13.540> lot<00:04:13.810> better<00:04:14.200> as<00:04:14.470> well<00:04:14.709> because<00:04:14.950> if<00:04:15.099> you

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
is a lot better as well because if you

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
coming from this one and this was just

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.970 
coming from this one and this was just
the<00:04:19.120> same<00:04:19.419> color<00:04:20.109> you'd<00:04:20.289> see<00:04:20.530> any<00:04:20.769> angle

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
Kendra's this one doesn't really work

Kendra's this one doesn't really work
with<00:04:25.310> cameras<00:04:25.730> because<00:04:25.940> you<00:04:26.690> can<00:04:26.870> see<00:04:27.140> on<00:04:27.230> the

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
with cameras because you can see on the

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.560 
with cameras because you can see on the
side<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:28.190> camera<00:04:28.550> is<00:04:28.580> a<00:04:28.670> holiday<00:04:29.030> that<00:04:29.270> shoots

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
side the camera is a holiday that shoots

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:35.140 
side the camera is a holiday that shoots
in<00:04:29.780> 1080p<00:04:30.370> full<00:04:31.370> HD<00:04:31.820> certify<00:04:33.850> under<00:04:34.850> here<00:04:35.060> I'm

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
in 1080p full HD certify under here I'm

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.460 
in 1080p full HD certify under here I'm
not<00:04:35.300> sure<00:04:35.450> how<00:04:35.630> well<00:04:35.810> you'll<00:04:36.020> be<00:04:36.050> able<00:04:36.200> to<00:04:36.320> see

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:36.470 
not sure how well you'll be able to see

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:47.360 
not sure how well you'll be able to see
this

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:53.990 

so<00:04:48.180> yeah<00:04:48.419> this<00:04:48.660> is<00:04:48.870> just<00:04:49.940> disk<00:04:51.050> computer<00:04:53.000> stop

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
so yeah this is just disk computer stop

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.640 
so yeah this is just disk computer stop
that<00:04:54.210> recording<00:04:54.720> and<00:04:54.960> we'll<00:04:55.050> go<00:04:57.290> watch<00:04:58.290> it<00:04:58.500> but

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
that recording and we'll go watch it but

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:02.990 
that recording and we'll go watch it but
this<00:04:58.740> probably<00:04:59.040> isn't<00:04:59.190> doing<00:04:59.430> anything<00:05:02.000> but

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
this probably isn't doing anything but

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.200 
this probably isn't doing anything but
it<00:05:03.240> is<00:05:03.540> really<00:05:03.990> really<00:05:04.440> sharp<00:05:04.710> this<00:05:05.490> recording

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
it is really really sharp this recording

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.420 
it is really really sharp this recording
I<00:05:06.419> oh<00:05:07.350> six<00:05:08.840> there's<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:09.960> good<00:05:10.139> update<00:05:10.410> that<00:05:10.889> it's

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
I oh six there's a good update that it's

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.790 
I oh six there's a good update that it's
not<00:05:11.669> really<00:05:11.970> necessary<00:05:12.410> but<00:05:13.410> there's<00:05:13.650> no

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
not really necessary but there's no

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.730 
not really necessary but there's no
really<00:05:14.280> big<00:05:14.550> features<00:05:15.000> that<00:05:15.180> are<00:05:15.330> not<00:05:15.740> that

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:16.740
