I think we used the the movies more of

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.870 
I think we used the the movies more of
an<00:02:00.530> influence<00:02:00.650> rather<00:02:01.190> than<00:02:01.430> other<00:02:01.610> games

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
an influence rather than other games

an influence rather than other games
obviously<00:02:02.870> in<00:02:03.200> terms<00:02:03.440> of<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.040> third<00:02:04.580> person

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
obviously in terms of the third person

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.000 
obviously in terms of the third person
action<00:02:05.090> and<00:02:05.720> melee<00:02:05.930> we<00:02:06.290> look<00:02:06.410> at<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.680> games<00:02:06.860> I

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
action and melee we look at the games I

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.940

Gotham informed the racing sequences but

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.380 
Gotham informed the racing sequences but
we<00:02:18.290> were<00:02:18.350> very<00:02:18.470> keen<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:19.010> use<00:02:19.460> a<00:02:19.880> great<00:02:20.210> deal<00:02:20.240> of

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
we were very keen to use a great deal of

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.300 
we were very keen to use a great deal of
inspiration<00:02:20.900> from<00:02:20.990> the<00:02:21.140> films<00:02:21.500> even<00:02:22.010> from<00:02:22.250> the

inspiration from the films even from the
books<00:02:22.550> just<00:02:23.510> to<00:02:23.600> get<00:02:23.750> a<00:02:23.780> feeling<00:02:24.080> of<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.350> bond

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
books just to get a feeling of the bond

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.050 
books just to get a feeling of the bond
world<00:02:24.800> and<00:02:25.070> make<00:02:25.160> sure<00:02:25.190> we<00:02:25.430> incorporate<00:02:25.970> that

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
world and make sure we incorporate that

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.180 
world and make sure we incorporate that
properly<00:02:26.390> into<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.750> ends<00:02:26.930> of<00:02:27.020> the<00:02:27.110> title<00:02:27.470> yeah

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
properly into the ends of the title yeah

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.380 
properly into the ends of the title yeah
so<00:02:28.370> there's<00:02:28.550> lots<00:02:28.670> of<00:02:28.730> different<00:02:28.790> lots<00:02:29.300> of

so there's lots of different lots of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.180 
so there's lots of different lots of
different<00:02:29.600> types<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.870> gameplay<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.709> mean<00:02:31.070> we

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
different types of gameplay I mean we

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.160 
different types of gameplay I mean we
were<00:02:31.220> keen<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.520> have<00:02:31.790> that<00:02:31.970> it's<00:02:32.450> a<00:02:32.540> bond<00:02:32.690> title

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
were keen to have that it's a bond title

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.630 
were keen to have that it's a bond title
the<00:02:33.260> bond<00:02:33.440> films<00:02:33.830> have<00:02:33.980> lots<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.340> different

the bond films have lots of different

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.340 
the bond films have lots of different
action<00:02:34.940> action<00:02:35.270> experiences<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.050> we<00:02:36.110> wanted

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
action action experiences and we wanted

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.020 
action action experiences and we wanted
to<00:02:36.410> incorporate<00:02:36.650> in<00:02:37.010> mind<00:02:37.220> that<00:02:37.610> in<00:02:37.730> the<00:02:37.820> game

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
to incorporate in mind that in the game

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.260 
to incorporate in mind that in the game
are<00:02:38.270> a<00:02:39.110> primary<00:02:39.680> objective<00:02:40.280> was<00:02:40.459> to<00:02:40.490> keep<00:02:40.790> keep

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
are a primary objective was to keep keep

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:42.640 
are a primary objective was to keep keep
the<00:02:41.420> narrative<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.020> cinematic<00:02:42.500> feel

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
the narrative and the cinematic feel

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.280 
the narrative and the cinematic feel
flowing<00:02:43.280> so<00:02:43.940> we<00:02:44.480> didn't<00:02:44.690> want<00:02:44.870> extended

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
flowing so we didn't want extended

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.260 
flowing so we didn't want extended
loading<00:02:45.590> sequences<00:02:46.160> so<00:02:46.400> when<00:02:46.700> you<00:02:46.850> get<00:02:47.090> when

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:47.270 
loading sequences so when you get when

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.479 
loading sequences so when you get when
you<00:02:47.420> when<00:02:47.720> you<00:02:47.810> go<00:02:48.230> from<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.950> hands<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.280> hand

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:49.489 
you when you go from the hands of hand

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.070 
you when you go from the hands of hand
or<00:02:49.730> the<00:02:49.760> third-person<00:02:50.150> shooting<00:02:50.570> into<00:02:50.959> the

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
or the third-person shooting into the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.340 
or the third-person shooting into the
racing<00:02:51.560> we<00:02:52.070> wanted<00:02:52.430> no<00:02:52.880> no<00:02:53.480> visible<00:02:53.870> break<00:02:54.110> in

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
racing we wanted no no visible break in

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.650 
racing we wanted no no visible break in
the<00:02:54.530> in<00:02:54.739> the<00:02:54.770> experience<00:02:55.280> so<00:02:55.610> we<00:02:56.390> use<00:02:56.540> the

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
the in the experience so we use the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.240 
the in the experience so we use the
cinematics<00:02:57.170> in<00:02:57.320> quite<00:02:57.470> a<00:02:57.500> unique<00:02:57.650> way<00:02:57.950> in<00:02:57.980> us

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
cinematics in quite a unique way in us

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.100 
cinematics in quite a unique way in us
in<00:02:58.520> that<00:02:58.670> sense<00:02:58.910> and<00:02:59.180> they<00:02:59.300> hide<00:02:59.570> the<00:02:59.810> loading

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
in that sense and they hide the loading

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.500 
in that sense and they hide the loading
sequences<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:00.830> when<00:03:01.010> we<00:03:01.100> go<00:03:01.220> from

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
sequences so when we go from

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.870 
sequences so when we go from
interactivity<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:03.440> cut<00:03:03.680> scene<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.459> the<00:03:04.760> next

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
interactivity to cut scene to the next

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.330 
interactivity to cut scene to the next
layer<00:03:05.510> of<00:03:05.630> interactivity<00:03:06.110> which<00:03:06.500> maybe<00:03:06.769> maybe

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
layer of interactivity which maybe maybe

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.400 
layer of interactivity which maybe maybe
in<00:03:07.640> a<00:03:07.700> car<00:03:07.910> maybe<00:03:08.269> in<00:03:08.480> a<00:03:08.570> boat<00:03:08.780> maybe

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
in a car maybe in a boat maybe

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:11.680 
in a car maybe in a boat maybe
hand-to-hand<00:03:10.070> it's<00:03:10.550> all<00:03:10.700> seamless<00:03:11.180> and<00:03:11.420> me

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
hand-to-hand it's all seamless and me

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.030 
hand-to-hand it's all seamless and me
now<00:03:11.840> to<00:03:11.900> just<00:03:12.170> flourish<00:03:12.590> nothing<00:03:12.830> that<00:03:12.950> gives

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
now to just flourish nothing that gives

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.229 
now to just flourish nothing that gives
a<00:03:13.160> player<00:03:13.370> a<00:03:13.459> much<00:03:13.640> more<00:03:13.850> cinematic

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
a player a much more cinematic

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.960 
a player a much more cinematic
experience<00:03:14.510> with<00:03:15.019> no<00:03:15.380> brakes<00:03:15.620> you<00:03:16.610> can<00:03:16.730> expect

experience with no brakes you can expect

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.640 
experience with no brakes you can expect
