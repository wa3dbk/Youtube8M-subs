00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.870
 oh my god I ask not about miracles and not about 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.100
 mirage 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:21.470
 about the strength of each day 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.470
 teach me the art of small steps 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.430
 make me observant and resourceful 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.230
 so that the diversity of everyday life on time 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.710
 dwell on discoveries and experiences 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.989
 who excited me teach me 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.430
 properly manage my time 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:43.710
 give me a fine sense of life to 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.280
 distinguish primary from 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.280
 secondary 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.969
 I ask for the strength of abstinence and measures to 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.940
 I never fluttered and slipped 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.860
 but reasonably planned for the day to 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.739
 see tops and gave 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:05.540
 and at least sometimes would find time for 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.540
 enjoyment of art 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.670
 help me understand that dreams can't 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.030
 to be of help 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.570
 no dreams of the past no dreams of the future 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.560
 help me to be here and now and 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:23.840
 perceive this moment as the most important 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:27.170
 save me from the naive belief that everything is in 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:30.290
 my life should be smooth give me 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.229
 clear awareness of the difficulty 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.010
 defeat falls and failures are 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:40.810
 only a natural part of life 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:43.970
 thanks to which we grow and vision 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.100
 remind me that the heart often argues with 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.350
 by reason 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.280
 send me at the right moment someone from 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.300

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.820
 say her loving i know that many 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:04.220
 problems are solved if nothing 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.700
 do so teach me patience you 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.380

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.959
 let me be worthy of it 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.780

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.739
 moment at the right time in the right place

 silently or speaking to give to someone 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.100
 necessary heat 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.680

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.989
 to reach those who are just below

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.549
 in life 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:41.450
