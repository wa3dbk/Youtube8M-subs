00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.369 
want to say so I am mainly a Search and
Destroy<00:00:38.250> player<00:00:38.670> for<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.000> most<00:00:39.210> part<00:00:39.450> I<00:00:39.660> play

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
Destroy player for the most part I play

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.819 
Destroy player for the most part I play
I<00:00:40.770> enjoy<00:00:41.190> playing<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.610> Dom<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.360> demo<00:00:42.829> those

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
I enjoy playing like Dom and demo those

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.020 
I enjoy playing like Dom and demo those
other<00:00:44.070> games<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.520> occasionally

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
other games and occasionally

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.840 
other games and occasionally
free-for-all<00:00:45.539> butts<00:00:45.960> I<00:00:46.430> mean<00:00:47.430> circular

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
free-for-all butts I mean circular

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580 
free-for-all butts I mean circular
choice<00:00:48.059> always<00:00:48.270> been<00:00:48.809> my<00:00:48.960> favorite<00:00:49.140> game<00:00:49.379> but

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
choice always been my favorite game but

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.220 
choice always been my favorite game but
probably<00:00:49.890> I<00:00:50.219> mean<00:00:50.820> I<00:00:50.850> don't<00:00:51.000> rage<00:00:51.360> I<00:00:51.719> currently

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
probably I mean I don't rage I currently

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.990 
probably I mean I don't rage I currently
ever<00:00:52.530> at<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:52.860> game<00:00:53.039> but<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.280> do<00:00:53.399> think<00:00:53.730> that

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
ever at this game but I do think that

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.029 
ever at this game but I do think that
part<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> reason<00:00:55.140> why<00:00:55.410> I<00:00:55.440> like<00:00:55.649> Search<00:00:55.920> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
part of the reason why I like Search and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.549 
part of the reason why I like Search and
Destroy<00:00:56.070> so<00:00:56.460> much<00:00:56.610> is<00:00:56.760> because<00:00:56.789> I<00:00:57.500> don't<00:00:58.500> know

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
Destroy so much is because I don't know

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.349 
Destroy so much is because I don't know
there<00:00:58.770> just<00:00:58.800> seems<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.129> be<00:00:59.219> less<00:00:59.460> BS<00:00:59.730> in<00:01:00.059> it<00:01:00.180> and

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
there just seems to be less BS in it and

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.910 
there just seems to be less BS in it and
that's<00:01:00.960> probably<00:01:01.199> just<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.410> there's<00:01:01.800> no

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
that's probably just because there's no

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.359 
that's probably just because there's no
spawns<00:01:02.250> which<00:01:02.879> we<00:01:03.030> all<00:01:03.149> know<00:01:04.129> the<00:01:05.129> spawns

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
spawns which we all know the spawns

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.670 
spawns which we all know the spawns
aren't<00:01:05.640> created<00:01:05.880> black<00:01:06.060> ops<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.570> mean<00:01:07.409> it's

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
aren't created black ops I mean it's

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.859 
aren't created black ops I mean it's
it's<00:01:08.340> been<00:01:08.549> so<00:01:08.729> already<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.570> think

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it's been so already and I think

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.450 
it's been so already and I think
everyone<00:01:10.290> knows<00:01:10.409> by<00:01:10.650> now<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:11.040> search<00:01:11.340> and

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
everyone knows by now and search and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.770 
everyone knows by now and search and
destroy<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:11.939> easiest<00:01:12.240> way<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.479> get<00:01:12.659> around

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
destroy is the easiest way to get around

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.109 
destroy is the easiest way to get around
that<00:01:13.049> because<00:01:13.320> there<00:01:13.680> are<00:01:13.710> no<00:01:13.950> spawns<00:01:14.250> but

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
that because there are no spawns but

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.490 
that because there are no spawns but
Search<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.540> Destroy<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.869> my<00:01:16.020> favorite<00:01:16.320> game

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
Search and Destroy is my favorite game

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.490 
Search and Destroy is my favorite game
so<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:17.220> class<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.490> thing<00:01:17.700> would<00:01:17.820> not<00:01:18.409> that<00:01:19.409> I'm

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
so the class of thing would not that I'm

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.649 
so the class of thing would not that I'm
going<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> talk<00:01:19.860> about<00:01:19.979> our<00:01:20.100> I<00:01:20.520> guess<00:01:21.420> Search

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659
