00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.639
 hello with you tatyana scolded him 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:20.410
 develop summer beach is paid 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:22.779
 with you and drew you a click now we 

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.520
 you understand what is remarkable 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.329
 in this platica 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.079
 as we see the front part can be clearly seen 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.029
 and behind 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:35.200
 what is there a cutout we can only 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:39.670
 assume if you will be doing behind 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.879
 too deep and wide cutout and 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.030
 in front and behind then on your shoulders 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:49.269
 products will not hold but maybe 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:53.410
 so you want to dress with one 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:57.550
 Shoulder filed and if you want it to be 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:01.839
 fixed or make a narrow 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:04.900
 and a shallow neckline at the back 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.780
 if you make a deep cut 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.930
 back on the back and do not want to 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.680
 the shoulders fell from the shoulder then you need 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.880
 tie 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.430
 it's up to you how best to do 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.390
 there 's nothing in the blood here 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.560
 special therefore no measurement 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.840
 do not need extra 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.369
 the only thing that you shoot 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.890
 chest circumference 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.110
 pedro circumference back length to waist 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:41.979
 product length and sleeve length 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:47.219
 take a piece of paper and measure this 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:52.560
 us product length line 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:56.109
 now we draw belts 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.990
 constructive find but I used to 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:02.079
 in our own way to do about the length of the product we 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.240
 we postpone long and not style from 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.929
 the bottom length of the product FER seventh cervical 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:11.020
 vertebra and the seventh cervical vertebra we 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:16.630
 put back length to waist set 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.280
 point then we find the thigh line and here 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:22.030
 this piece of dulin 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:26.310
 further and here is the cervical vertebra is it with us 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:30.160
 there will be a chest line and now we are with you 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.340
 let us put constructive pulses to 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:37.000
 on these scales 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.690
 we set aside the measurements we needed for 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.140
 building such a paid 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:47.020
 so let's start from the top to work with you from 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.400
 mouths if you do not 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.930
 deep cut 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:55.630
 and since I initially initially you 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.760
 then explained the code centers that we have 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.580
 will be the center 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.470
 spin the glasses in this center set aside 10 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:10.060
 centimeters then two and a half 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:15.420
 round the corner then you make a straight 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:21.040
 the line is the shoulder shoulder line 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:24.549
 set aside 10 centimeters to find in 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:26.140
 This place and set aside 3 centimeters on 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:29.019
 shoulder bevel 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.530
 here we will do from the base of the neck through 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:33.100
 Now this point of the line or rather we 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.610
 found 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:42.040
 shoulder line and immediately measure out until then 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.730
 how far will we be 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.560
 sleeves 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:51.280
 that is, 30 centimeters 35 35 see there in 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:53.790
 watched your lay then ticker 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.579
 exactly in this place will be a rectangle 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:04:02.560
 draw a straight line it will be width 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:05.920
 sleeves from the base wider centimeters 6 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:12.730
 you go down in order to 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:17.620
 make a cutout for shoulders then this 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:20.950
 distance here we have or not line 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:27.820
 breasts we divide this distance by 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:29.960
 in half and we will from from this line do 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.900
 round like this 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:37.830
 here we are in the captivity of trouble postponed 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.480
 little girl hip circumference yours according to your 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:45.270
 to measure further we draw side seam and 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:54.960
 waistline it should also be in this 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:05:00.690
 place betrayed on like this all have 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:03.750
 you and me drawing is ready here in this 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:06.510
 place if you will do a defender then 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.470
 make a defender if you do 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:15.690
 deep neckline deep neckline 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:18.500
 as far as possible and now we cut 

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.500
 you nickname 

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:47.010
 that's the way we will handle 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.600
 the neck 

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:51.850
 the mouth can be separately that is 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.790
 back separately and let's say 

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:58.300
 shelf 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:06:00.850
 sorry please we can this 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.520
 handle separately throat 

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:10.840
 also separately we can process 

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:12.640
 cut the habit and then like this 

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:16.960
 we will mix 

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:20.410
 finished cut and ready 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:25.180
 here is this hole date for shoulder we 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:27.100
 already with a pollock along the shoulder seams like this 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:30.430
 way yes if you will do everything 

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:36.970
 the same tweezers then you make the tweezers 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:39.580
 at the same distance here and together with 

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:43.240
 defenders you grip the side cut 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:52.960
 then work the bottom of the sleeves 

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:55.479
 and then you connect here so we sleep ochkuyu 

00:06:52.960 --> 00:07:00.070
 shelf and last but not least you 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:07:04.419
 developers side cut and process 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:07.780
 the bottom of the product is such a simple thing 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:11.110
 I suggested to you and if suddenly 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.600
