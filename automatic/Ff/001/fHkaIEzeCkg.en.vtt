to stir it every same minute or two just

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.419 
to stir it every same minute or two just
make<00:01:17.450> sure<00:01:17.600> it<00:01:17.720> all<00:01:17.840> stays<00:01:17.869> together<00:01:18.440> and<00:01:18.830> that

00:01:19.419 --> 00:01:19.429 
make sure it all stays together and that

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.310 
make sure it all stays together and that
it<00:01:19.520> doesn't<00:01:19.759> burn<00:01:19.910> on<00:01:20.030> the<00:01:20.119> bottom<00:01:20.149> but<00:01:21.140> for

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:21.320 
it doesn't burn on the bottom but for

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:22.210 
it doesn't burn on the bottom but for
this<00:01:21.440> step<00:01:21.649> we're<00:01:21.800> going<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:22.070> use<00:01:22.190> a

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.220 
this step we're going to use a

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.710 
this step we're going to use a
thermometer<00:01:22.580> now<00:01:23.390> these<00:01:23.509> are<00:01:23.690> very

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:23.720 
thermometer now these are very

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.570 
thermometer now these are very
inexpensive<00:01:24.050> I<00:01:24.530> got<00:01:24.679> this<00:01:24.740> off<00:01:24.920> Amazon<00:01:25.160> for

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
inexpensive I got this off Amazon for

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.309 
inexpensive I got this off Amazon for
about<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:26.060> think<00:01:26.300> is<00:01:26.479> ten<00:01:26.690> to<00:01:26.780> fifteen<00:01:27.050> dollars

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:27.319 
about I think is ten to fifteen dollars

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:29.020 
about I think is ten to fifteen dollars
so<00:01:27.440> they're<00:01:27.560> very<00:01:27.590> cheap<00:01:28.039> and<00:01:28.520> what<00:01:28.700> we<00:01:28.819> wanted

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
so they're very cheap and what we wanted

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.660 
so they're very cheap and what we wanted
to<00:01:29.090> get<00:01:29.270> up<00:01:29.360> to<00:01:29.479> is<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.660> firm<00:01:30.080> ball<00:01:30.349> stage<00:01:30.740> so<00:01:31.520> we

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
to get up to is a firm ball stage so we

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.639 
to get up to is a firm ball stage so we
wanted<00:01:31.849> to<00:01:31.910> get<00:01:32.060> up<00:01:32.119> to<00:01:32.209> about<00:01:32.380> 245<00:01:33.380> degrees

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
wanted to get up to about 245 degrees

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:37.600 
wanted to get up to about 245 degrees
Fahrenheit<00:01:34.459> or<00:01:34.899> 120<00:01:35.899> degrees<00:01:35.990> Celsius<00:01:36.890> so

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
Fahrenheit or 120 degrees Celsius so

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.830 
Fahrenheit or 120 degrees Celsius so
give<00:01:37.759> this<00:01:37.849> a<00:01:37.910> good<00:01:38.090> stir<00:01:38.149> where<00:01:38.569> you<00:01:38.630> say<00:01:38.780> two

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
give this a good stir where you say two

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.290 
give this a good stir where you say two
to<00:01:39.110> three<00:01:39.259> minutes<00:01:39.560> just<00:01:40.399> so<00:01:40.580> it<00:01:40.610> all<00:01:40.759> stays<00:01:41.030> as

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
to three minutes just so it all stays as

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.210 
to three minutes just so it all stays as
nice<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:41.750> combined<00:01:42.229> and<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.649> know<00:01:42.770> risk

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
nice and combined and you know risk

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.160 
nice and combined and you know risk
burning<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:43.759> bottom<00:01:44.060> and<00:01:44.330> it<00:01:44.869> should<00:01:45.050> take

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
burning the bottom and it should take

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.699 
burning the bottom and it should take
about<00:01:45.289> thirty<00:01:45.739> minutes<00:01:47.319> okay<00:01:48.319> so<00:01:48.349> as<00:01:48.590> you<00:01:48.649> can

00:01:48.699 --> 00:01:48.709 
about thirty minutes okay so as you can

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:50.620 
about thirty minutes okay so as you can
see<00:01:48.979> it<00:01:49.099> has<00:01:49.190> now<00:01:49.310> reached<00:01:49.340> firm<00:01:50.000> ball<00:01:50.239> stage

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
see it has now reached firm ball stage

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.479 
see it has now reached firm ball stage
so<00:01:51.410> I<00:01:51.440> said<00:01:51.619> it'd<00:01:51.709> take<00:01:51.830> about<00:01:51.860> half<00:01:52.250> an<00:01:52.369> hour

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:52.489 
so I said it'd take about half an hour

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:55.029 
so I said it'd take about half an hour
texture<00:01:52.849> taken<00:01:53.119> close<00:01:53.330> to<00:01:53.509> 45<00:01:54.020> minutes<00:01:54.229> but<00:01:54.860> it

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 
texture taken close to 45 minutes but it

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:56.760 
texture taken close to 45 minutes but it
takes<00:01:55.160> longer<00:01:55.459> than<00:01:55.489> that<00:01:55.700> that's<00:01:55.940> fine

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
takes longer than that that's fine

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.960 
takes longer than that that's fine
it's<00:01:57.770> just<00:01:57.950> one<00:01:58.069> of<00:01:58.099> those<00:01:58.220> recipes<00:01:58.580> we<00:01:58.789> just

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
it's just one of those recipes we just

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:00.550 
it's just one of those recipes we just
need<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.119> bit<00:01:59.239> of<00:01:59.270> patience<00:01:59.780> if<00:02:00.050> it<00:02:00.200> takes<00:02:00.349> a<00:02:00.440> bit

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
need a bit of patience if it takes a bit

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.529 
need a bit of patience if it takes a bit
longer<00:02:00.590> it<00:02:01.130> makes<00:02:01.310> no<00:02:01.429> difference<00:02:01.520> whatsoever

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
longer it makes no difference whatsoever

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:03.580 
longer it makes no difference whatsoever
as<00:02:02.660> long<00:02:02.810> as<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:02.989> gets<00:02:03.140> to<00:02:03.349> the<00:02:03.440> right

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
as long as it gets to the right

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.559 
as long as it gets to the right
temperature<00:02:04.090> so<00:02:05.090> now<00:02:05.179> we're<00:02:05.300> going<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.479> take

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
temperature so now we're going to take

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:07.540 
temperature so now we're going to take
this<00:02:05.690> straight<00:02:05.959> off<00:02:06.080> the<00:02:06.170> stove<00:02:06.410> okay<00:02:07.340> next

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
this straight off the stove okay next

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.100 
this straight off the stove okay next
I'm<00:02:07.700> just<00:02:07.759> going<00:02:07.910> to<00:02:08.060> dish<00:02:08.179> you<00:02:08.360> just<00:02:08.690> line<00:02:08.929> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
I'm just going to dish you just line the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.719 
I'm just going to dish you just line the
base<00:02:09.319> with<00:02:09.649> some<00:02:09.679> non-stick<00:02:10.190> baking<00:02:10.369> paper

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
base with some non-stick baking paper

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.820 
base with some non-stick baking paper
they<00:02:11.300> can<00:02:11.360> make<00:02:11.569> it<00:02:11.690> as<00:02:11.780> thick<00:02:11.930> or<00:02:12.290> as<00:02:12.379> thin<00:02:12.530> as

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
they can make it as thick or as thin as

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.500 
they can make it as thick or as thin as
you<00:02:12.860> like<00:02:12.950> it's<00:02:13.489> really<00:02:13.700> up<00:02:13.879> to<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:14.150> it<00:02:14.330> makes

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
you like it's really up to you it makes

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.000 
you like it's really up to you it makes
no<00:02:14.629> difference<00:02:14.720> so<00:02:15.440> it's<00:02:15.590> just<00:02:15.709> a<00:02:15.860> simple

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
no difference so it's just a simple

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.890 
no difference so it's just a simple
matter<00:02:16.310> of<00:02:16.370> pouring<00:02:16.819> a<00:02:16.970> mixture<00:02:17.239> into<00:02:17.780> the

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
matter of pouring a mixture into the

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.620 
matter of pouring a mixture into the
dish

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.150 

okay<00:02:24.630> once<00:02:24.870> it's<00:02:25.020> all<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.230> there<00:02:25.440> we<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.070> let

say<00:02:27.900> six<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.380> eight<00:02:28.500> hours<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.550> time

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
say six to eight hours and that time

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.790 
say six to eight hours and that time
it's<00:02:29.940> going<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.090> completely<00:02:30.570> set<00:02:30.960> okay<00:02:31.740> so
