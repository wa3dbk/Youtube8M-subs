00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
off before I store them for future usage

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.190 
off before I store them for future usage
you<00:04:28.150> can<00:04:28.330> see<00:04:28.510> they<00:04:28.720> fit<00:04:29.500> nicely<00:04:29.830> here<00:04:30.490> in<00:04:30.760> my

recipe<00:04:47.280> using<00:04:48.280> bison<00:04:49.060> and<00:04:49.240> venison<00:04:49.840> reasons

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
recipe using bison and venison reasons

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.570 
recipe using bison and venison reasons
why<00:04:50.920> use<00:04:51.250> both<00:04:51.490> bison<00:04:52.060> and<00:04:52.210> venison<00:04:53.580> mainly

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
why use both bison and venison mainly

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.840 
why use both bison and venison mainly
because<00:04:54.780> both<00:04:55.780> meats<00:04:56.140> have<00:04:56.440> great<00:04:57.070> amino<00:04:57.400> acid

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
because both meats have great amino acid

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.240 
because both meats have great amino acid
profiles<00:04:58.360> and<00:04:58.780> just<00:04:59.169> kind<00:04:59.410> of<00:04:59.440> extending<00:05:00.130> that

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:00.250 
profiles and just kind of extending that

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.120 
profiles and just kind of extending that
amino<00:05:00.550> acid<00:05:00.970> profile<00:05:01.360> there<00:05:01.600> that<00:05:02.200> allows<00:05:02.590> for

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
amino acid profile there that allows for

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.390 
amino acid profile there that allows for
more<00:05:03.280> cellular<00:05:03.850> uptake<00:05:04.060> protein<00:05:04.990> that<00:05:05.110> allows

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400 
more cellular uptake protein that allows

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:10.500 
more cellular uptake protein that allows
for<00:05:06.400> more<00:05:08.010> ability<00:05:09.010> to<00:05:09.190> use<00:05:09.550> the<00:05:09.850> protein<00:05:10.300> that

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:10.510 
for more ability to use the protein that

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.450 
for more ability to use the protein that
you're<00:05:10.720> eating<00:05:11.140> and<00:05:11.380> to<00:05:11.530> use<00:05:11.710> the<00:05:11.860> protein<00:05:12.310> in

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:12.460 
you're eating and to use the protein in

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:14.010 
you're eating and to use the protein in
other<00:05:12.610> foods<00:05:12.910> because<00:05:13.150> those<00:05:13.330> amino<00:05:13.570> acids

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
other foods because those amino acids

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.000 
other foods because those amino acids
are<00:05:14.080> going<00:05:14.200> to<00:05:14.260> be<00:05:14.320> floating<00:05:14.680> around<00:05:14.770> your

I do get to my fit foods but there's
nothing<00:06:05.450> like<00:06:05.600> getting<00:06:05.810> your<00:06:06.050> own<00:06:06.170> cooking

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:06.440
