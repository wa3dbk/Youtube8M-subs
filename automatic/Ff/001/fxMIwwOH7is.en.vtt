in<00:01:32.640> for<00:01:32.820> a<00:01:32.850> touchdown<00:01:33.060> but<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.689> back<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
in for a touchdown but going back and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.200 
in for a touchdown but going back and
taking<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.470> look<00:01:34.500> at<00:01:34.710> his<00:01:34.890> perspective<00:01:35.579> it's<00:01:35.790> a

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
taking a look at his perspective it's a

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.240 
taking a look at his perspective it's a
little<00:01:36.570> easier<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.170> see<00:01:37.380> why<00:01:37.590> this<00:01:37.650> pass<00:01:38.040> would

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
little easier to see why this pass would

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.160 
little easier to see why this pass would
be<00:01:38.400> thrown<00:01:38.759> here<00:01:38.970> there<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.600> little<00:01:39.900> bit<00:01:40.049> of

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
be thrown here there is a little bit of

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.749 
be thrown here there is a little bit of
pressure<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.829> didn't<00:01:41.220> have<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
pressure that we didn't have in the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.880 
pressure that we didn't have in the
first<00:01:42.090> example<00:01:42.570> but<00:01:43.200> here<00:01:43.530> you're<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:43.829> to

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
first example but here you're going to

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.230 
first example but here you're going to
be<00:01:44.009> able<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.220> see<00:01:44.399> Nick's<00:01:44.640> comes<00:01:44.880> out<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.180> the

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
be able to see Nick's comes out of the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.020 
be able to see Nick's comes out of the
route<00:01:45.479> he<00:01:46.049> runs<00:01:46.350> underneath<00:01:46.710> Harris<00:01:47.310> and<00:01:47.520> now

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
route he runs underneath Harris and now

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.999 
route he runs underneath Harris and now
it's<00:01:48.390> basically<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.899> foot<00:01:49.229> race<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.649> you<00:01:49.740> want

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
it's basically a foot race and you want

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.999 
it's basically a foot race and you want
to<00:01:50.100> throw<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.610> inside<00:01:51.000> position

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
to throw it to the inside position

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.170 
to throw it to the inside position
Nick's<00:01:53.009> actually<00:01:53.430> looks<00:01:53.640> like<00:01:53.729> he's<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.090> to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
Nick's actually looks like he's going to

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.999 
Nick's actually looks like he's going to
start<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.509> separate<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.439> then<00:01:55.590> when<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:55.829> ball

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
start to separate but then when the ball

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.520 
start to separate but then when the ball
is<00:01:56.040> thrown<00:01:56.430> just<00:01:56.460> look<00:01:56.939> at<00:01:57.030> how<00:01:57.149> fast<00:01:57.600> Harris

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
is thrown just look at how fast Harris

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.730 
is thrown just look at how fast Harris
is<00:01:58.710> able<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.070> accelerate<00:01:59.520> and<00:02:00.000> cut<00:02:00.299> under<00:02:00.740> to

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
is able to accelerate and cut under to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.289 
is able to accelerate and cut under to
accommodate<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.460> interception<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:03.210> this

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
accommodate this interception and this

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.030 
accommodate this interception and this
stuff<00:02:03.630> that's<00:02:03.810> impossible<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.530> read<00:02:04.770> as<00:02:04.979> a

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
stuff that's impossible to read as a

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.580 
stuff that's impossible to read as a
quarterback<00:02:05.909> you<00:02:06.240> can't<00:02:06.570> expect<00:02:07.140> that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
quarterback you can't expect that

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.109 
quarterback you can't expect that
something<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.160> this<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.429> going<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.759> occur

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
something like this is going to occur

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.449 
something like this is going to occur
and<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:10.080> what<00:02:10.410> quarterback<00:02:10.950> is<00:02:11.129> going<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> be

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
and this what quarterback is going to be

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.610 
and this what quarterback is going to be
that<00:02:11.670> aggressive<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.660> jump<00:02:12.930> this<00:02:13.110> rattin

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
that aggressive to jump this rattin

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.800 
that aggressive to jump this rattin
obviously<00:02:14.040> it's<00:02:14.220> just<00:02:14.430> kind<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.239> fault<00:02:15.599> of

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
obviously it's just kind of the fault of

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.720 
obviously it's just kind of the fault of
can<00:02:16.019> I<00:02:16.110> turn<00:02:16.170> upfield<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.980> go<00:02:17.159> over<00:02:17.340> fast

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
can I turn upfield and go over fast

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.940 
can I turn upfield and go over fast
enough<00:02:18.030> to<00:02:18.150> outrun<00:02:18.239> the<00:02:19.019> offensive<00:02:19.560> line<00:02:19.590> and

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
enough to outrun the offensive line and

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.649 
enough to outrun the offensive line and
go<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.190> for<00:02:20.400> a<00:02:20.430> score<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:20.940> this<00:02:21.299> is<00:02:21.450> something

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
go in for a score but this is something

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.270 
go in for a score but this is something
I<00:02:21.840> really<00:02:22.019> want<00:02:22.290> to<00:02:22.319> see<00:02:22.379> refine<00:02:22.890> me<00:02:23.099> I

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
I really want to see refine me I

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.039 
I really want to see refine me I
honestly<00:02:23.970> have<00:02:24.269> ninety<00:02:24.900> percent

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
honestly have ninety percent

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.320 
honestly have ninety percent
interceptions<00:02:25.950> whether<00:02:26.549> they're<00:02:26.819> for<00:02:27.090> or

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
interceptions whether they're for or

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.869 
interceptions whether they're for or
against<00:02:27.810> me<00:02:28.019> happen<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:28.650> this<00:02:29.129> same<00:02:29.400> kind<00:02:29.700> of

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
against me happen in this same kind of

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.030 
against me happen in this same kind of
way<00:02:30.090> where<00:02:30.659> the<00:02:30.780> cornerbacks<00:02:31.319> are<00:02:31.500> jumping<00:02:31.950> in

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
way where the cornerbacks are jumping in

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.949 
way where the cornerbacks are jumping in
front<00:02:32.159> of<00:02:32.280> wide<00:02:32.459> receivers<00:02:32.970> on<00:02:33.120> slants<00:02:33.599> we're

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
front of wide receivers on slants we're

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.569 
front of wide receivers on slants we're
really<00:02:34.170> they're<00:02:34.440> not<00:02:34.590> even<00:02:34.860> in<00:02:34.980> position<00:02:35.400> to

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
really they're not even in position to

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.550 
really they're not even in position to
do<00:02:35.760> so<00:02:36.000> they<00:02:36.390> should<00:02:36.599> just<00:02:36.629> be<00:02:36.930> defending<00:02:37.440> the

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
do so they should just be defending the

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.680 
do so they should just be defending the
pass<00:02:37.769> rather<00:02:38.400> than<00:02:38.670> doing<00:02:38.879> this<00:02:39.120> this<00:02:39.269> example

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
pass rather than doing this this example

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.710 
pass rather than doing this this example
as<00:02:39.930> I<00:02:40.079> talked<00:02:40.319> about<00:02:40.590> twice<00:02:41.250> in<00:02:41.579> 30<00:02:42.180> seconds<00:02:42.599> of

the<00:02:42.780> game<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:43.319> just<00:02:43.890> a<00:02:44.069> little<00:02:44.280> hokey<00:02:44.610> from<00:02:44.819> me

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
the game is just a little hokey from me

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.849 
the game is just a little hokey from me
something<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.690> would<00:02:45.900> like<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.079> see<00:02:46.379> cleared<00:02:46.709> up
