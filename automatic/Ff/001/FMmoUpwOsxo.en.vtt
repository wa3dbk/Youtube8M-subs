00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.630
 conversely, the Spanish step 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.550
 I usually start with that 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.380
 Spanish cruz on because that is 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.560
 nothing but the Spanish step 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.480
 the goal is the selection in the target 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.960
 horse on command to stomp 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.850
 bring 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.220
 by a light touch on the 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.600
 fore leg imitating an insect that 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.600
 shaken off the horse 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.809
 I agree that somewhere on the foreleg 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:40.699
 Horse supplier returned and as well 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.409
 smallest reaction comes if it only one 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.659
 Raise a bit is or bit 

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:48.129
 shrug then I praise that's the first one 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:50.390
 small success step on the way 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.640
 First, the trainer has to find out 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.579
 at which point of the front legs it is 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.439
 horse most sensitive to when 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.539
 One should have found this post 

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:02.420
 reaction of the horse gradually 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:05.890
 increased and the lifting and stretching phase 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.890
 of the leg 

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.740
 only if this is good with both legs 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.399
 does it work you go to the Spanish 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.399
 step over 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.259
 around 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.310
 the 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.840
 As a next step I go to it 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.719
 about me either on a straight 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.939
 line along the wall or if I am 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:51.670
 in round pen band at the finish line 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:55.509
 outside steps go a few forward 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.250
 then a leg of typing spanish 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.079
 step so let it stretch and 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.479
 Immediately back in step one two 

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:04.420
 steps continue to go first again 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:06.429
 let same stretch tapping leg 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.799
 go back a few steps so that 

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.660
 Once a string is stabilized then 

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:12.069
 I go to the other hand and do 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.010
 the same then with the other leg 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:16.690
 and when both legs are in motion 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.250
 safely available 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.440
 then i can go to the next level 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.379
 go over and ask yourself 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.629
 so-called Volcker work the polka 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.549
 is a pre-exercise of the Spanish step 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.349
 with a reciprocal lifting 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.099
 legs and a step sequence 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.099
 between 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.920
 you count as follows on 1 type in one 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.019
 front leg on then the horse is two 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:46.150
 you go on that you tap that 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.150
 other forelimb and so on 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.799
 No 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.879
 part 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.120
 It is very important that you already 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.489
 early the forward movement to 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.190
 otherwise you have a horse what 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.380
 stop on the spot and the 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.069
 front legs great but lifts the 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.650
 behind hand 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:16.510
 which is miles behind and 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.010
 just does not come along and this one 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.720
 mistake is then very very difficult too 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.180
 so please fix it right in 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.040
 small steps from the beginning to the 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.040
 to increase again 

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.060
 with every recognizable 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.380
 training progress will be the 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.380
 shortened 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.390
 until the horse like here the spanish 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.390
 Step dominated 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.480
 So that's the demanding one too 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.120
 exercise for those who felt a practicing one 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.950
 really needs to pay close attention 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.659
 which leg can not touch that 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.670
 be raised at all 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.670
 it just has to be the timing 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.490
 si
