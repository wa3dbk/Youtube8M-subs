00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:03.950 
going to use this old chestnut but it's

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.349 
going to use this old chestnut but it's
that<00:00:04.950> comes<00:00:05.250> from<00:00:05.370> a<00:00:05.490> Latin<00:00:05.850> word<00:00:05.879> and<00:00:06.240> it

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
that comes from a Latin word and it

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.530 
that comes from a Latin word and it
means<00:00:06.569> to<00:00:06.690> draw<00:00:07.259> out<00:00:07.970> that<00:00:08.970> which<00:00:09.120> is<00:00:09.269> already

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
means to draw out that which is already

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.400 
means to draw out that which is already
there<00:00:10.790> so<00:00:11.790> every<00:00:12.090> child<00:00:12.360> has<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.960> potential

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
there so every child has the potential

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.630 
there so every child has the potential
to<00:00:14.540> learn<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.680> find<00:00:17.400> satisfaction

to learn and to find satisfaction
through<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.480> learning<00:00:18.980> so<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.160> role<00:00:20.490> of

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
through that learning so the role of

uplifting and inspiring I think the most

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.520 
uplifting and inspiring I think the most
important<00:02:31.010> attribute<00:02:31.670> would<00:02:31.880> be<00:02:32.240> to<00:02:32.840> set<00:02:33.500> a

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
important attribute would be to set a

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:35.410 
important attribute would be to set a
really<00:02:34.040> good<00:02:34.070> example<00:02:34.190> to<00:02:34.880> the<00:02:34.970> children

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
really good example to the children

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.010 
really good example to the children
particularly<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:36.860> word<00:02:37.220> and<00:02:37.430> deed<00:02:37.550> so<00:02:38.090> if<00:02:38.870> I

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:39.020 
particularly in word and deed so if I

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.960 
particularly in word and deed so if I
say<00:02:39.320> something<00:02:39.350> I've<00:02:39.860> got<00:02:40.100> to<00:02:40.310> believe<00:02:40.760> in

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
say something I've got to believe in

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.550
