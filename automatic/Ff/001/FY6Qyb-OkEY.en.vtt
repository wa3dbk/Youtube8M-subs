00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:04.010 

so<00:00:01.740> let's<00:00:02.490> take<00:00:02.669> a<00:00:02.700> look<00:00:02.939> at<00:00:03.240> a<00:00:03.300> polygonal

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
so let's take a look at a polygonal

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.110 
so let's take a look at a polygonal
modeling<00:00:04.560> technique<00:00:04.950> called<00:00:05.130> quad<00:00:05.520> modeling

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
modeling technique called quad modeling

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.780 
modeling technique called quad modeling
and<00:00:06.890> first<00:00:07.890> I<00:00:08.040> just<00:00:08.189> want<00:00:08.309> to<00:00:08.370> cover<00:00:08.519> some

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
and first I just want to cover some

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.600 
and first I just want to cover some
really<00:00:09.000> basic<00:00:09.150> stuff<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:10.190> so<00:00:11.190> let's<00:00:11.370> jump

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
really basic stuff and so let's jump

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.169 
really basic stuff and so let's jump
into<00:00:11.790> Maya<00:00:12.059> and<00:00:12.950> what's<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:14.070> quad<00:00:14.340> well<00:00:14.849> it's

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
into Maya and what's a quad well it's

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.000 
into Maya and what's a quad well it's
not<00:00:15.420> a<00:00:15.839> it's<00:00:16.770> not<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.980> triangle<00:00:18.560> triangle<00:00:19.560> is

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
not a it's not a triangle triangle is

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.980 
not a it's not a triangle triangle is
basically<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.760> simplest<00:00:21.210> kind<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.600> surface

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
basically the simplest kind of surface

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.230 
basically the simplest kind of surface
you<00:00:22.140> can<00:00:22.289> create<00:00:22.560> three<00:00:23.100> edges<00:00:23.430> three<00:00:23.850> points

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
you can create three edges three points

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.779 
you can create three edges three points
and<00:00:25.080> triangles<00:00:25.650> were<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:26.250> mean<00:00:26.490> they're<00:00:26.609> still

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
and triangles were I mean they're still

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.720 
and triangles were I mean they're still
used<00:00:27.029> for<00:00:27.539> modeling<00:00:28.260> today<00:00:28.439> but<00:00:28.830> they're

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
used for modeling today but they're

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.749 
used for modeling today but they're
really<00:00:29.939> more<00:00:30.179> common<00:00:30.859> you<00:00:31.859> know<00:00:31.890> for<00:00:32.340> kind<00:00:32.700> of

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
really more common you know for kind of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.069 
really more common you know for kind of
older<00:00:33.180> game<00:00:33.989> consoles<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.210> PC<00:00:36.210> games<00:00:36.420> if<00:00:36.960> we

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
older game consoles and PC games if we

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.170 
older game consoles and PC games if we
take<00:00:37.230> a<00:00:37.290> look<00:00:37.469> at<00:00:37.590> this<00:00:37.710> kind<00:00:37.980> of<00:00:38.059> you<00:00:39.059> know

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
take a look at this kind of you know

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.420 
take a look at this kind of you know
it's<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> pretty<00:00:39.600> primitive<00:00:39.899> low<00:00:40.739> resolution

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
it's a pretty primitive low resolution

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.260 
it's a pretty primitive low resolution
really<00:00:41.910> light<00:00:43.100> model<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.430> was<00:00:44.550> very

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
really light model that was very

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.680 
really light model that was very
efficient<00:00:45.780> for<00:00:46.050> these<00:00:46.289> early<00:00:46.800> game<00:00:47.219> engines

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
efficient for these early game engines

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.729 
efficient for these early game engines
you<00:00:48.690> know<00:00:48.809> if<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:48.960> take<00:00:48.989> a<00:00:49.170> look<00:00:49.320> at<00:00:49.440> his<00:00:49.559> helmet

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you know if we take a look at his helmet

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.000 
you know if we take a look at his helmet
kind<00:00:50.219> of<00:00:50.280> simple<00:00:50.670> polygonal<00:00:51.210> representation

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
kind of simple polygonal representation

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.400 
kind of simple polygonal representation
of<00:00:53.010> the<00:00:53.219> form<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:54.660> all<00:00:54.840> created<00:00:55.379> with

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
of the form and it's all created with

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.010 
of the form and it's all created with
these<00:00:55.770> with<00:00:56.340> faces<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.910> these<00:00:57.059> triangular

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
these with faces with these triangular

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.040 
these with faces with these triangular
faces<00:00:58.879> it's<00:00:59.879> been<00:01:00.059> around<00:01:00.270> for<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> long<00:01:00.750> time

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
faces it's been around for a long time

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.049 
faces it's been around for a long time
this<00:01:01.260> polygonal<00:01:01.949> modeling<00:01:02.520> since<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
this polygonal modeling since the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.070 
this polygonal modeling since the
beginning<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.600> kind<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.619> 3d<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:06.020> another<00:01:07.020> thing

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
beginning of kind of 3d so another thing

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.120 
beginning of kind of 3d so another thing
that<00:01:07.320> a<00:01:07.530> quad<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.280> not<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:09.049> this<00:01:10.049> thing<00:01:10.979> called

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that a quad is not is this thing called

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.350 
that a quad is not is this thing called
an<00:01:11.340> n-sided<00:01:11.760> surface<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:13.340> an<00:01:14.340> n-sided<00:01:14.790> surface

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
an n-sided surface so an n-sided surface

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.200 
an n-sided surface so an n-sided surface
sometimes<00:01:15.780> called<00:01:16.320> an<00:01:16.439> N<00:01:16.619> gone<00:01:16.890> and<00:01:17.280> basically

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
sometimes called an N gone and basically

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.730 
sometimes called an N gone and basically
an<00:01:18.299> end<00:01:18.450> gone<00:01:18.659> has<00:01:19.549> five<00:01:20.549> or<00:01:20.909> more<00:01:21.240> edges<00:01:21.740> you

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
an end gone has five or more edges you

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.460 
an end gone has five or more edges you
know<00:01:22.860> these<00:01:23.100> guys<00:01:23.520> are<00:01:24.060> really<00:01:24.090> not<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.229> good

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
know these guys are really not so good

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.249 
know these guys are really not so good
if<00:01:25.680> you're<00:01:25.830> doing<00:01:26.070> polygonal<00:01:27.030> modeling<00:01:27.540> or

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
if you're doing polygonal modeling or

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.810 
if you're doing polygonal modeling or
even<00:01:28.770> if<00:01:28.890> you're<00:01:29.040> doing<00:01:29.220> subdivision

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
even if you're doing subdivision

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.819 
even if you're doing subdivision
modeling<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.990> kind<00:01:31.380> of<00:01:31.439> want<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.650> avoid

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
modeling you kind of want to avoid

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.270 
modeling you kind of want to avoid
incited<00:01:32.790> surfaces<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> number<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.140> reasons

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
incited surfaces for a number of reasons

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.350 
incited surfaces for a number of reasons
you<00:01:35.280> know<00:01:35.369> this<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.579> gonna<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.759> triangulated

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
you know this is gonna be triangulated

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.380 
you know this is gonna be triangulated
anyway<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.490> basically<00:01:38.490> you're<00:01:38.909> leaving<00:01:39.270> it

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
anyway and basically you're leaving it

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.420 
anyway and basically you're leaving it
to<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.630> software<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.470> determine<00:01:40.979> for<00:01:41.220> you

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
to the software to determine for you

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.460 
to the software to determine for you
what<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.240> surfaces<00:01:42.659> are<00:01:42.750> gonna<00:01:42.869> look<00:01:43.259> like

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
what the surfaces are gonna look like

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.039 
what the surfaces are gonna look like
but<00:01:43.740> how<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.070> gonna<00:01:44.159> be<00:01:44.399> broken<00:01:44.790> down<00:01:45.049> anyway

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
but how it's gonna be broken down anyway

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.020 
but how it's gonna be broken down anyway
you<00:01:46.110> want<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> kind<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.680> avoid<00:01:47.030> incited

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
you want to kind of avoid incited

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.060 
you want to kind of avoid incited
surfaces<00:01:48.479> around<00:01:48.600> guns<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.890> anyway<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> quad<00:01:50.820> is

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
surfaces around guns so anyway a quad is

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.670 
surfaces around guns so anyway a quad is
pretty<00:01:53.070> obvious<00:01:53.299> quad<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:55.200> know<00:01:55.320> four

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
pretty obvious quad is you know four

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.950 
pretty obvious quad is you know four
there's<00:01:56.250> four<00:01:56.490> sides<00:01:56.820> to<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.240> that's<00:01:57.810> what

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
there's four sides to it that's what

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.060 
there's four sides to it that's what
we're<00:01:58.079> gonna<00:01:58.200> cut<00:01:58.439> with<00:01:58.590> we're<00:01:58.799> gonna<00:01:58.890> be

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
we're gonna cut with we're gonna be

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.649 
we're gonna cut with we're gonna be
focusing<00:01:59.549> on<00:01:59.729> taking<00:02:00.420> a<00:02:00.450> look<00:02:00.570> at<00:02:00.780> right<00:02:01.469> now

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
focusing on taking a look at right now

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:07.370 
focusing on taking a look at right now
so<00:02:03.680> what<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.860> quad<00:02:05.189> modeling<00:02:05.700> well<00:02:06.380> basically

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
so what is quad modeling well basically

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.490 
so what is quad modeling well basically
it's<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.310> it's<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.300> polygonal<00:02:09.569> modeling<00:02:10.080> method

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
it's a it's a polygonal modeling method

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.260 
it's a it's a polygonal modeling method
used<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.160> break<00:02:11.430> down<00:02:11.610> any

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
used to break down any

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.540 
used to break down any
flex<00:02:12.510> form<00:02:12.840> into<00:02:13.410> a<00:02:13.440> surface<00:02:13.770> that<00:02:14.190> only

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
flex form into a surface that only

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.120 
flex form into a surface that only
contains<00:02:15.060> four<00:02:15.360> excited<00:02:15.900> faces<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:16.620> Kwan's

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
contains four excited faces so Kwan's

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:19.390 
contains four excited faces so Kwan's
basically<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.880> pod<00:02:18.330> modeling<00:02:18.780> can<00:02:18.960> just<00:02:19.200> be

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
basically and pod modeling can just be

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.070 
basically and pod modeling can just be
creating<00:02:20.400> quad<00:02:20.880> models<00:02:21.390> for<00:02:21.570> example<00:02:21.930> the

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
creating quad models for example the

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.610 
creating quad models for example the
quad<00:02:22.410> game<00:02:23.220> models<00:02:23.670> but<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.570> time<00:02:24.840> I'm<00:02:25.500> gonna

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
quad game models but this time I'm gonna

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.980 
quad game models but this time I'm gonna
be<00:02:25.800> focusing<00:02:26.220> on<00:02:26.370> using<00:02:26.580> quad<00:02:26.940> modeling<00:02:27.540> for

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
be focusing on using quad modeling for

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.100 
be focusing on using quad modeling for
creating<00:02:28.440> high<00:02:28.920> resolution<00:02:29.700> surfaces<00:02:30.360> so

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
creating high resolution surfaces so

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.680 
creating high resolution surfaces so
basically<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.520> quad<00:02:32.790> modeling<00:02:33.240> techniques

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
basically the quad modeling techniques

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.770 
basically the quad modeling techniques
will<00:02:33.870> be<00:02:33.900> used<00:02:34.410> with<00:02:35.340> either<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.120> smooth<00:02:36.450> tool

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
will be used with either the smooth tool

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.040 
will be used with either the smooth tool
or<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.380> can<00:02:37.410> also<00:02:37.680> use<00:02:38.150> subdivision<00:02:39.150> surfaces

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.350 

so<00:02:43.050> what<00:02:44.010> are<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.190> advantages<00:02:44.310> to<00:02:45.210> using

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
so what are the advantages to using

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.460 
so what are the advantages to using
quads<00:02:45.920> well<00:02:46.920> one<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.640> big<00:02:47.790> ones<00:02:48.030> is<00:02:48.470> that

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
quads well one of the big ones is that

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.560 
quads well one of the big ones is that
they're<00:02:50.280> very<00:02:50.490> predictable<00:02:50.820> when<00:02:51.390> we're

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
they're very predictable when we're

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.040 
they're very predictable when we're
doing<00:02:51.690> smoothing<00:02:52.380> or<00:02:52.620> we're<00:02:52.860> converting<00:02:53.370> to<00:02:53.550> a

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
doing smoothing or we're converting to a

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.690 
doing smoothing or we're converting to a
subdivision<00:02:55.050> surface<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.830> I'm<00:02:56.340> gonna<00:02:56.460> jump

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
subdivision surface and I'm gonna jump

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:58.940 
subdivision surface and I'm gonna jump
again<00:02:56.970> back<00:02:57.240> into<00:02:57.420> Maya<00:02:57.690> take<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> look<00:02:58.770> at<00:02:58.860> this

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
again back into Maya take a look at this

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.350 
again back into Maya take a look at this
this<00:02:59.340> part<00:02:59.700> here<00:02:59.970> this<00:03:00.840> is<00:03:01.020> a<00:03:01.050> part<00:03:01.590> from<00:03:01.800> a

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
this part here this is a part from a

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.960 
this part here this is a part from a
this<00:03:03.360> is<00:03:03.510> kind<00:03:03.660> of<00:03:03.750> like<00:03:03.870> the<00:03:04.050> gear<00:03:04.970> mechanism

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
this is kind of like the gear mechanism

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.600 
this is kind of like the gear mechanism
for<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.540> guitar<00:03:07.250> that<00:03:08.250> we're<00:03:08.340> gonna<00:03:08.430> be

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
for a guitar that we're gonna be

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.560 
for a guitar that we're gonna be
modeling<00:03:08.850> really<00:03:09.510> soon<00:03:09.840> but<00:03:10.710> this<00:03:11.610> is<00:03:11.820> created

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
modeling really soon but this is created

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.260 
modeling really soon but this is created
completely<00:03:12.780> with<00:03:13.200> quads<00:03:13.610> even<00:03:14.610> though<00:03:14.820> we

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:15.270 
completely with quads even though we

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.790 
completely with quads even though we
take<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> look<00:03:15.660> at<00:03:15.750> this<00:03:15.870> top<00:03:16.140> here<00:03:16.440> it<00:03:16.530> looks

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
take a look at this top here it looks

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.640 
take a look at this top here it looks
like<00:03:16.980> a<00:03:17.070> triangle<00:03:17.370> right<00:03:18.180> but<00:03:18.990> in<00:03:19.260> fact

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
like a triangle right but in fact

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.580 
like a triangle right but in fact
there's<00:03:20.690> around<00:03:21.690> this<00:03:21.990> face<00:03:22.290> there's

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
there's around this face there's

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.260 
there's around this face there's
actually<00:03:22.950> four<00:03:23.190> edges<00:03:23.370> if<00:03:23.670> we<00:03:23.820> take<00:03:24.000> this<00:03:24.120> and

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
actually four edges if we take this and

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:27.949 
actually four edges if we take this and
we<00:03:24.330> smooth<00:03:24.720> it<00:03:25.310> okay<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:26.720> maybe<00:03:27.720> we'll<00:03:27.870> do

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 
we smooth it okay and maybe we'll do

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.670 
we smooth it okay and maybe we'll do
that<00:03:28.110> again<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:30.420> can<00:03:30.450> see<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:31.080> even<00:03:31.500> though

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
that again you can see that even though

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.449 
that again you can see that even though
the<00:03:31.709> geometry<00:03:32.700> is<00:03:32.820> much<00:03:33.090> smoother<00:03:33.630> and<00:03:34.459> more

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
the geometry is much smoother and more

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.610 
the geometry is much smoother and more
complex<00:03:35.910> okay<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:36.870> this<00:03:37.080> is<00:03:37.230> much<00:03:37.380> smoother

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
complex okay so this is much smoother

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:42.140 
complex okay so this is much smoother
there<00:03:40.620> you<00:03:40.890> have<00:03:41.100> this<00:03:41.220> really<00:03:41.520> nice<00:03:41.850> and

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
there you have this really nice and

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.420 
there you have this really nice and
clean<00:03:42.480> kind<00:03:43.290> of<00:03:43.380> edge<00:03:43.590> Network

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
clean kind of edge Network

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.310 
clean kind of edge Network
okay<00:03:44.820> that's<00:03:45.090> running<00:03:45.360> around<00:03:45.720> the<00:03:45.900> surface

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:46.320 
okay that's running around the surface

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:49.000 
okay that's running around the surface
and<00:03:46.530> following<00:03:46.950> the<00:03:47.070> edges<00:03:47.400> so<00:03:48.209> it's<00:03:48.540> very

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
and following the edges so it's very

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.380 
and following the edges so it's very
easy<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.310> see<00:03:50.580> if<00:03:50.850> you're<00:03:51.030> having<00:03:51.209> any

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
easy to see if you're having any

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.090 
easy to see if you're having any
problems<00:03:51.740> which<00:03:52.740> leads<00:03:53.580> me<00:03:53.790> to<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.630> next

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
problems which leads me to the next

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.730 
problems which leads me to the next
advantage<00:03:56.100> of<00:03:56.880> using<00:03:57.150> quads<00:03:57.570> is<00:03:58.260> that<00:03:58.560> they're

00:03:58.730 --> 00:03:58.740 
advantage of using quads is that they're

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.710 
advantage of using quads is that they're
easier<00:03:59.010> to<00:03:59.070> troubleshoot<00:03:59.930> so<00:04:00.930> by<00:04:01.740> that<00:04:01.920> I<00:04:01.980> mean

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 
easier to troubleshoot so by that I mean

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.320 
easier to troubleshoot so by that I mean
let's<00:04:03.720> look<00:04:03.870> at<00:04:03.990> this<00:04:04.140> other<00:04:05.060> saw<00:04:06.060> there<00:04:06.209> guy

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 
let's look at this other saw there guy

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:09.949 
let's look at this other saw there guy
here<00:04:06.630> this<00:04:07.500> is<00:04:07.680> kind<00:04:07.890> of<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.070> reject<00:04:08.750> we<00:04:09.750> take

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
here this is kind of the reject we take

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:13.850 
here this is kind of the reject we take
this<00:04:10.140> guy<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:11.030> it<00:04:12.030> looks<00:04:12.360> fine<00:04:12.810> it<00:04:13.530> looks<00:04:13.709> just

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
this guy and it looks fine it looks just

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:15.410 
this guy and it looks fine it looks just
like<00:04:14.040> the<00:04:14.190> other<00:04:14.340> one<00:04:14.550> before<00:04:14.880> we<00:04:15.000> smooth<00:04:15.300> it

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
like the other one before we smooth it

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.520 
like the other one before we smooth it
it<00:04:15.600> but<00:04:16.260> if<00:04:16.440> we<00:04:16.560> smooth<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:17.190> one

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.140 

we<00:04:20.530> see<00:04:20.799> that<00:04:20.949> we're<00:04:21.220> getting<00:04:21.579> this<00:04:21.729> kind<00:04:22.060> of

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
we see that we're getting this kind of

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.080 
we see that we're getting this kind of
weird<00:04:22.590> network<00:04:23.590> of<00:04:23.800> edges<00:04:24.160> like<00:04:24.370> all<00:04:24.669> of<00:04:24.910> these

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
weird network of edges like all of these

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.680 
weird network of edges like all of these
edges<00:04:25.510> seem<00:04:26.350> to<00:04:26.590> coalesce<00:04:27.070> into<00:04:27.460> this

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
edges seem to coalesce into this

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
edges seem to coalesce into this
circular<00:04:28.690> kind<00:04:28.900> of<00:04:29.610> pattern<00:04:30.610> here<00:04:30.820> and<00:04:31.710> you

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
circular kind of pattern here and you

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.129 
circular kind of pattern here and you
know<00:04:32.800> where<00:04:32.979> this<00:04:33.190> is<00:04:33.250> whereas<00:04:34.030> this<00:04:34.180> is<00:04:34.240> not<00:04:34.570> a

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
know where this is whereas this is not a

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.610 
know where this is whereas this is not a
terrible<00:04:35.860> thing<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:36.160> guess<00:04:36.430> I<00:04:37.199> mean<00:04:38.199> maybe<00:04:38.440> you

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
terrible thing I guess I mean maybe you

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.110 
terrible thing I guess I mean maybe you
might<00:04:38.800> want<00:04:39.010> to<00:04:39.070> have<00:04:39.220> something<00:04:39.760> coming<00:04:39.910> up

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
might want to have something coming up

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.580 
might want to have something coming up
coming<00:04:40.540> out<00:04:40.660> of<00:04:40.780> here<00:04:40.900> for<00:04:41.110> example<00:04:41.320> to

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:41.590 
coming out of here for example to

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.909 
coming out of here for example to
extrude<00:04:41.889> something<00:04:42.250> out<00:04:43.110> you<00:04:44.110> know<00:04:44.229> you<00:04:44.770> don't

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:44.919 
extrude something out you know you don't

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.189 
extrude something out you know you don't
want<00:04:45.070> to<00:04:45.100> do<00:04:45.190> it<00:04:45.310> this<00:04:45.430> way<00:04:45.669> this<00:04:46.540> is<00:04:46.600> more<00:04:46.960> this

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
want to do it this way this is more this

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:51.510 
want to do it this way this is more this
is<00:04:47.260> just<00:04:47.380> a<00:04:47.620> mistake<00:04:48.010> so<00:04:49.979> if<00:04:50.979> we<00:04:51.190> look<00:04:51.340> at<00:04:51.400> the

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
is just a mistake so if we look at the

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.469 
is just a mistake so if we look at the
wireframe<00:04:52.030> again

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.500 

basically<00:04:55.479> we<00:04:56.380> had<00:04:56.590> a<00:04:56.860> problem<00:04:57.130> here<00:04:57.550> one<00:04:58.389> of

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
basically we had a problem here one of

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:02.040 
basically we had a problem here one of
these<00:04:58.600> points<00:04:59.410> was<00:04:59.949> not<00:05:00.160> connected<00:05:00.639> okay<00:05:01.060> so

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
these points was not connected okay so

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.350 
these points was not connected okay so
we<00:05:02.139> have<00:05:02.260> this<00:05:02.410> hole<00:05:02.740> in<00:05:03.130> the<00:05:03.190> in<00:05:03.789> the<00:05:04.000> plugin

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
we have this hole in the in the plugin

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.290 
we have this hole in the in the plugin
and<00:05:04.479> surface<00:05:04.840> so<00:05:05.080> you<00:05:05.340> know<00:05:06.340> when<00:05:06.760> you<00:05:06.910> smooth

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:07.300 
and surface so you know when you smooth

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.750 
and surface so you know when you smooth
these<00:05:07.960> things<00:05:08.260> become<00:05:08.560> really<00:05:08.590> obvious<00:05:11.760> so

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
these things become really obvious so

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.370 
these things become really obvious so
another<00:05:13.060> kind<00:05:13.240> of<00:05:13.419> good<00:05:13.539> reason<00:05:13.900> for<00:05:14.229> using

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
another kind of good reason for using

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.980 
another kind of good reason for using
quads<00:05:14.800> is<00:05:15.389> that<00:05:16.389> it<00:05:16.479> tends<00:05:16.630> to<00:05:16.690> be<00:05:16.810> more

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:16.990 
quads is that it tends to be more

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.170 
quads is that it tends to be more
flexible<00:05:17.229> so<00:05:18.010> you<00:05:18.340> know<00:05:18.490> if<00:05:18.580> you<00:05:18.669> make<00:05:18.880> if<00:05:19.090> you

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:19.180 
flexible so you know if you make if you

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.200 
flexible so you know if you make if you
build<00:05:19.419> something<00:05:19.720> using<00:05:20.650> a<00:05:20.740> quad<00:05:21.039> method<00:05:21.789> you

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
build something using a quad method you

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.300 
build something using a quad method you
can<00:05:22.360> easily<00:05:22.510> convert<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:23.740> quads<00:05:24.010> in<00:05:24.220> two

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
can easily convert the quads in two

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:27.480 
can easily convert the quads in two
tries<00:05:24.550> because<00:05:24.820> basically<00:05:25.180> a<00:05:25.450> quad<00:05:25.810> is<00:05:26.400> if<00:05:27.400> you

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
tries because basically a quad is if you

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.490 
tries because basically a quad is if you
split<00:05:27.849> a<00:05:27.910> quad<00:05:28.240> from<00:05:28.479> corner<00:05:28.810> to<00:05:28.840> corner<00:05:28.960> you

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:29.500 
split a quad from corner to corner you

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.400 
split a quad from corner to corner you
get<00:05:29.620> to<00:05:29.770> a<00:05:29.800> triangle<00:05:30.280> so<00:05:30.900> if<00:05:31.900> I<00:05:32.020> show<00:05:32.200> you<00:05:32.229> this

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
get to a triangle so if I show you this

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.500 
get to a triangle so if I show you this
in<00:05:32.530> Maya<00:05:32.770> here's<00:05:33.639> a<00:05:33.700> surface<00:05:34.120> build<00:05:34.360> with

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:34.510 
in Maya here's a surface build with

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.010 
in Maya here's a surface build with
quads<00:05:34.810> and<00:05:35.169> if<00:05:36.160> I<00:05:36.460> let's<00:05:37.300> say<00:05:37.450> I<00:05:37.479> just<00:05:37.570> smooth

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
quads and if I let's say I just smooth

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:41.940 
quads and if I let's say I just smooth
it<00:05:38.550> once<00:05:39.550> here<00:05:40.000> you<00:05:40.180> know<00:05:41.050> it's<00:05:41.349> still<00:05:41.590> just

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
it once here you know it's still just

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:43.980 
it once here you know it's still just
the<00:05:42.039> more<00:05:42.190> complex<00:05:42.520> quad<00:05:42.820> service<00:05:43.240> if<00:05:43.630> I<00:05:43.780> go

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
the more complex quad service if I go

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.159 
the more complex quad service if I go
for<00:05:44.440> some<00:05:44.620> reason<00:05:44.979> I<00:05:45.450> have<00:05:46.450> to<00:05:46.599> go<00:05:46.750> in<00:05:46.900> here<00:05:47.110> and

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:47.169 
for some reason I have to go in here and

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:50.129 
for some reason I have to go in here and
convert<00:05:47.979> this<00:05:48.130> to<00:05:48.280> triangles<00:05:48.880> you<00:05:49.840> know<00:05:49.960> it's

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:50.139 
convert this to triangles you know it's

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.070 
convert this to triangles you know it's
it's<00:05:50.380> gonna<00:05:50.500> be<00:05:50.680> very<00:05:50.889> predictable<00:05:51.250> here<00:05:52.080> the

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 
it's gonna be very predictable here the

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.730 
it's gonna be very predictable here the
surface<00:05:53.500> is<00:05:53.680> not<00:05:54.250> gonna<00:05:54.460> change<00:05:54.760> very<00:05:55.539> much

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 
surface is not gonna change very much

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:58.409 
surface is not gonna change very much
but<00:05:56.740> now<00:05:56.889> it's<00:05:57.099> completely<00:05:57.280> made<00:05:58.180> with

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
but now it's completely made with

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:01.500 
but now it's completely made with
triangles<00:05:59.410> so<00:05:59.650> so<00:06:00.160> that's<00:06:00.340> another<00:06:00.580> good

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
triangles so so that's another good

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.540 
triangles so so that's another good
advantage<00:06:03.270> one<00:06:04.270> final<00:06:04.750> point<00:06:05.020> is<00:06:05.320> that<00:06:05.650> you

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
advantage one final point is that you

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.080 
advantage one final point is that you
know<00:06:06.669> if<00:06:06.760> we<00:06:06.849> do<00:06:06.940> need<00:06:07.090> to<00:06:07.150> convert<00:06:07.539> to

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
know if we do need to convert to

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:11.370 
know if we do need to convert to
subdivision<00:06:10.090> surfaces<00:06:10.570> it<00:06:10.900> works<00:06:11.199> really

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
subdivision surfaces it works really

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.980 
subdivision surfaces it works really
nicely<00:06:11.680> as<00:06:11.979> well<00:06:12.190> so<00:06:12.580> let's<00:06:12.789> just<00:06:13.030> back<00:06:13.720> out<00:06:13.960> of

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:13.990 
nicely as well so let's just back out of

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:16.680 
nicely as well so let's just back out of
here<00:06:14.199> for<00:06:14.410> a<00:06:14.470> second<00:06:14.800> so<00:06:15.090> let's<00:06:16.090> convert<00:06:16.360> this

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
here for a second so let's convert this

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:24.180 
here for a second so let's convert this
to<00:06:17.550> sub<00:06:18.550> D<00:06:18.729> surface<00:06:20.280> okay<00:06:21.630> so<00:06:22.860> you<00:06:23.860> know<00:06:23.979> it's

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.190 
to sub D surface okay so you know it's

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:27.719 
to sub D surface okay so you know it's
it's<00:06:24.849> pretty<00:06:25.210> nice<00:06:25.330> and<00:06:25.539> clean<00:06:25.810> you<00:06:26.550> know<00:06:27.550> in

00:06:27.719 --> 00:06:27.729 
it's pretty nice and clean you know in

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:29.760 
it's pretty nice and clean you know in
in<00:06:27.969> general<00:06:28.300> even<00:06:28.690> if<00:06:28.840> you're<00:06:29.020> modeling<00:06:29.500> with

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
in general even if you're modeling with

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.480 
in general even if you're modeling with
triangles<00:06:30.640> it<00:06:30.820> tends<00:06:31.060> to<00:06:31.180> be<00:06:31.390> okay<00:06:31.719> but<00:06:31.780> I<00:06:32.490> just

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:33.490 
triangles it tends to be okay but I just

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:35.850 
triangles it tends to be okay but I just
find<00:06:33.700> that<00:06:33.909> you<00:06:34.599> know<00:06:34.719> you<00:06:34.780> get<00:06:34.990> a<00:06:35.020> much<00:06:35.260> better

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
find that you know you get a much better

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.520 
find that you know you get a much better
result<00:06:36.130> when<00:06:36.580> you<00:06:36.640> use<00:06:37.440> quads<00:06:38.440> so<00:06:39.039> and<00:06:40.530> since

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:41.530 
result when you use quads so and since

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:45.330 
result when you use quads so and since
my<00:06:41.830> 2009<00:06:42.700> one<00:06:43.419> two<00:06:43.690> and<00:06:43.840> three<00:06:44.229> keys<00:06:44.650> you've

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:45.340 
my 2009 one two and three keys you've

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:47.760 
my 2009 one two and three keys you've
got<00:06:45.580> to<00:06:45.700> get<00:06:45.760> a<00:06:45.820> smooth<00:06:46.210> preview<00:06:46.900> and<00:06:47.260> so<00:06:47.650> if

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:47.770 
got to get a smooth preview and so if

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.770 
got to get a smooth preview and so if
you<00:06:47.890> hit<00:06:48.010> one<00:06:48.520> it's<00:06:48.909> the<00:06:49.060> original<00:06:49.240> low

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
you hit one it's the original low

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:51.899 
you hit one it's the original low
resolution<00:06:50.680> poly<00:06:50.950> okay

00:06:51.899 --> 00:06:51.909 
resolution poly okay

00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:55.020 
resolution poly okay
if<00:06:52.000> you<00:06:52.930> hit<00:06:53.080> three<00:06:53.530> it's<00:06:54.190> kind<00:06:54.550> of<00:06:54.639> like<00:06:54.820> what

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:55.030 
if you hit three it's kind of like what

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.270 
if you hit three it's kind of like what
you'd<00:06:55.270> get<00:06:55.539> if<00:06:56.020> you<00:06:56.229> smooth<00:06:56.680> it<00:06:56.860> in<00:06:56.950> a<00:06:57.010> couple

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
you'd get if you smooth it in a couple

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.089 
you'd get if you smooth it in a couple
times<00:06:57.520> you<00:06:58.210> can<00:06:58.360> actually<00:06:58.389> adjust<00:06:58.990> the<00:06:59.740> how

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:00.099 
times you can actually adjust the how

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:03.000 
times you can actually adjust the how
much<00:07:00.280> it<00:07:00.460> smooths<00:07:01.020> how<00:07:02.020> much<00:07:02.200> it<00:07:02.380> rounds<00:07:02.830> it

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.010 
much it smooths how much it rounds it

00:07:03.010 --> 00:07:04.020 
much it smooths how much it rounds it
off

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:04.030 
off

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:05.790 
off
in<00:07:04.450> in<00:07:04.870> the<00:07:05.020> settings<00:07:05.349> that<00:07:05.380> we'll<00:07:05.530> talk<00:07:05.650> about

00:07:05.790 --> 00:07:05.800 
in in the settings that we'll talk about

00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.070 
in in the settings that we'll talk about
later<00:07:06.310> and<00:07:06.729> the<00:07:07.389> other<00:07:07.510> thing<00:07:07.690> that<00:07:07.719> you<00:07:07.900> can

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 
later and the other thing that you can

00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.399 
later and the other thing that you can
do<00:07:08.229> is<00:07:08.440> you<00:07:09.039> can<00:07:09.130> have<00:07:09.340> the<00:07:09.490> the<00:07:09.849> original

00:07:10.399 --> 00:07:10.409 
do is you can have the the original

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:15.149 
do is you can have the the original
polygonal<00:07:11.490> cage<00:07:12.490> kind<00:07:13.210> of<00:07:13.300> displayed<00:07:14.159> around

00:07:15.149 --> 00:07:15.159 
polygonal cage kind of displayed around

00:07:15.159 --> 00:07:17.190 
polygonal cage kind of displayed around
the<00:07:15.520> smooth<00:07:15.909> object<00:07:16.360> so<00:07:16.479> you<00:07:16.510> can<00:07:16.719> depend<00:07:17.080> a

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.200 
the smooth object so you can depend a

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.830 
the smooth object so you can depend a
model<00:07:17.620> and<00:07:17.800> see<00:07:18.130> what<00:07:19.029> you're<00:07:19.180> creating<00:07:19.510> at

00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:19.840 
model and see what you're creating at

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:22.080 
model and see what you're creating at
the<00:07:19.930> same<00:07:20.110> time<00:07:20.409> so<00:07:20.620> this<00:07:20.740> is<00:07:20.800> a<00:07:20.950> really<00:07:21.430> handy

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:22.090 
the same time so this is a really handy

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.290 
the same time so this is a really handy
tool<00:07:22.479> so<00:07:23.440> a<00:07:23.469> really<00:07:24.190> efficient<00:07:25.060> way<00:07:25.150> of

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:25.300 
tool so a really efficient way of

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.440 
tool so a really efficient way of
working<00:07:26.310> yes<00:07:27.310> I<00:07:27.550> guess<00:07:27.789> that's<00:07:28.000> about<00:07:28.120> it<00:07:28.240> the

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.450 
working yes I guess that's about it the

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:31.290 
working yes I guess that's about it the
other<00:07:28.479> other<00:07:29.110> little<00:07:29.440> point<00:07:29.710> is<00:07:30.580> that<00:07:30.729> I<00:07:30.789> find

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
other other little point is that I find

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.180 
other other little point is that I find
that<00:07:31.510> when<00:07:32.050> you're<00:07:32.229> when<00:07:32.529> your<00:07:32.650> UV<00:07:32.950> mapping

00:07:33.180 --> 00:07:33.190 
that when you're when your UV mapping

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:35.279 
that when you're when your UV mapping
it's<00:07:33.789> visually<00:07:34.300> easier<00:07:34.719> to<00:07:34.870> see<00:07:35.080> what's

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:35.289 
it's visually easier to see what's

00:07:35.289 --> 00:07:36.839 
it's visually easier to see what's
happening<00:07:35.650> in<00:07:35.800> your<00:07:35.919> UV<00:07:36.250> mapping<00:07:36.490> when<00:07:36.760> you

00:07:36.839 --> 00:07:36.849 
happening in your UV mapping when you

00:07:36.849 --> 00:07:39.240 
happening in your UV mapping when you
when<00:07:37.090> you're<00:07:37.210> working<00:07:37.330> with<00:07:37.919> square<00:07:38.919> shapes

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.250 
when you're working with square shapes

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.290 
when you're working with square shapes
just<00:07:39.820> the<00:07:40.419> way<00:07:40.510> that<00:07:40.719> it<00:07:40.810> lays<00:07:41.169> out<00:07:41.940> and<00:07:42.940> stuff

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:43.300 
just the way that it lays out and stuff

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:48.570 
just the way that it lays out and stuff
so<00:07:43.680> so<00:07:44.680> anyway<00:07:44.950> let's<00:07:45.849> get<00:07:46.630> into<00:07:47.580> modeling

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:48.580 
so so anyway let's get into modeling

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.889 
so so anyway let's get into modeling
this<00:07:48.729> and<00:07:49.060> create<00:07:49.389> some<00:07:50.200> quad<00:07:50.440> models
