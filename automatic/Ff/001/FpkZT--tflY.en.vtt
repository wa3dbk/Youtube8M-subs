knitters might knit backwards and let's

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.939

to do everything in Reverse this isn't

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.720 
to do everything in Reverse this isn't
true<00:00:38.940> but<00:00:39.450> once<00:00:39.690> you've<00:00:39.899> learned<00:00:40.320> how<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.430> knit

in a particular way any of you will

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.920 
in a particular way any of you will
realize<00:00:44.579> it's<00:00:45.000> difficult<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.750> learn<00:00:45.870> a

realize it's difficult to learn a
completely<00:00:46.469> new<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.680> different<00:00:46.980> way<00:00:47.370> of

completely new and different way of

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.639 
completely new and different way of
knitting<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:47.969> since<00:00:48.539> there's<00:00:48.899> no<00:00:49.079> reason<00:00:49.469> why

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
knitting and since there's no reason why

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.090 
knitting and since there's no reason why
they<00:00:49.860> can't<00:00:50.100> knit<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.809> knit<00:00:51.809> mirror<00:00:52.140> would

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
they can't knit and knit mirror would

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.119 
they can't knit and knit mirror would
may<00:00:53.250> continue<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:53.940> so<00:00:54.559> another<00:00:55.559> reason

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
may continue to do so another reason

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.639 
may continue to do so another reason
that<00:00:56.809> someone<00:00:57.809> might<00:00:57.899> choose<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.500> knit

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that someone might choose to knit

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.819 
that someone might choose to knit
backwards<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:59.460> mirror<00:01:00.180> is<00:01:00.329> if<00:01:01.230> they<00:01:01.350> detest

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
backwards or mirror is if they detest

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.850 
backwards or mirror is if they detest
purling<00:01:02.579> for<00:01:02.850> long<00:01:03.059> stretches<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.710> you're

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
purling for long stretches so if you're

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.580 
purling for long stretches so if you're
knitting<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.159> stockinette<00:01:05.220> and<00:01:06.380> rather<00:01:07.380> than

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
knitting in stockinette and rather than

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.469 
knitting in stockinette and rather than
purling<00:01:08.189> flipping<00:01:08.729> your<00:01:08.850> work<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.210> purling

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
purling flipping your work and purling

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.020 
purling flipping your work and purling
back<00:01:09.840> you<00:01:10.470> can<00:01:10.710> keep<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.070> right<00:01:11.189> side<00:01:11.460> facing

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
back you can keep the right side facing

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.630 
back you can keep the right side facing
and<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.530> knit<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.710> stitches<00:01:13.979> from<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.460> right

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
and you knit the stitches from the right

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.510 
and you knit the stitches from the right
needle<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.119> left<00:01:15.390> needle<00:01:16.369> so<00:01:17.369> that's

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
needle to the left needle so that's

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.969 
needle to the left needle so that's
another<00:01:17.759> reason<00:01:18.000> why<00:01:18.270> why<00:01:18.920> somebody<00:01:19.920> might

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
another reason why why somebody might

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.850 
another reason why why somebody might
choose<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.640> do<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.509> reason<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.990> sometimes

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
choose to do that the reason I sometimes

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.219 
choose to do that the reason I sometimes
choose<00:01:23.790> to<00:01:25.549> do<00:01:26.549> marinading<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.540> if<00:01:28.080> I'm

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
choose to do marinading is if I'm

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.010 
choose to do marinading is if I'm
knitting<00:01:28.470> very<00:01:29.009> short<00:01:29.549> rows<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.270> that's<00:01:30.689> what

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
knitting very short rows and that's what

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.120 
knitting very short rows and that's what
I'm<00:01:31.110> going<00:01:31.350> to<00:01:31.470> show<00:01:31.680> today<00:01:33.229> so<00:01:34.229> let's<00:01:34.590> knit<00:01:35.100> a

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
I'm going to show today so let's knit a

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.830 
I'm going to show today so let's knit a
bobble<00:01:35.670> so<00:01:35.820> you<00:01:35.909> can<00:01:36.060> see<00:01:37.100> why<00:01:38.100> I<00:01:38.130> would<00:01:38.579> use

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
bobble so you can see why I would use

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.690 
bobble so you can see why I would use
backwards<00:01:39.840> knitting<00:01:40.250> first<00:01:41.250> thing<00:01:41.490> you<00:01:41.579> have

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
backwards knitting first thing you have

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.880 
backwards knitting first thing you have
to<00:01:41.850> do<00:01:42.030> when<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.840> need<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.020> bobble<00:01:43.409> is<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.710> need

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
to do when you need a bobble is you need

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.639 
to do when you need a bobble is you need
to<00:01:43.920> increase<00:01:44.930> quite<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> few<00:01:46.170> stitches<00:01:46.350> so<00:01:46.590> I'm

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
to increase quite a few stitches so I'm

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.260 
to increase quite a few stitches so I'm
going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.799> make<00:01:46.950> five<00:01:47.430> stitches<00:01:47.729> out<00:01:48.030> of<00:01:48.149> this

going to make five stitches out of this
one<00:01:48.570> I'm<00:01:49.290> going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.590> do<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.860> by<00:01:50.009> knitting<00:01:50.399> into

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
one I'm going to do it by knitting into

00:01:50.579 --> 00:02:00.340 
one I'm going to do it by knitting into
the<00:01:50.729> front<00:01:52.100> on<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.159> back<00:01:55.189> and<00:01:56.189> on<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.549> front

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
losing my anchor and back and then and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.830 
losing my anchor and back and then and
with<00:02:08.280> knitting<00:02:08.610> it<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:08.910> the<00:02:09.060> front<00:02:10.790> now

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
with knitting it in the front now

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.240 
with knitting it in the front now
normally<00:02:12.840> what<00:02:12.959> you<00:02:13.110> would<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:13.800> do<00:02:13.980> is

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
normally what you would have to do is

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.960 
normally what you would have to do is
you<00:02:14.490> would<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:14.940> flip<00:02:15.240> the<00:02:15.420> work<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.970> then

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
you would have to flip the work and then

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.370 
you would have to flip the work and then
you<00:02:18.330> would<00:02:18.660> have<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:20.390> Pro<00:02:21.390> back<00:02:21.660> across<00:02:22.020> these

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
you would have to Pro back across these

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.920 
you would have to Pro back across these
five<00:02:22.680> stitches<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:23.580> then<00:02:24.209> you<00:02:24.450> would<00:02:24.630> flip

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
five stitches and then you would flip

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.000 
five stitches and then you would flip
the<00:02:24.989> work<00:02:25.319> again

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
the work again

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.940 
the work again
and<00:02:26.630> then<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.720> would<00:02:27.840> knit<00:02:27.989> across<00:02:28.140> them<00:02:28.680> and

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
and then you would knit across them and

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.260 
and then you would knit across them and
then<00:02:29.100> you'd<00:02:29.220> flip<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.580> again<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.880> purl<00:02:30.239> across

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
then you'd flip it again a purl across

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.120 
then you'd flip it again a purl across
you<00:02:30.600> do<00:02:30.780> this<00:02:30.959> several<00:02:31.200> times<00:02:31.350> back<00:02:31.769> and<00:02:31.980> forth

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
you do this several times back and forth

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.770 
you do this several times back and forth
back<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:32.370> forth<00:02:32.580> and<00:02:32.970> if<00:02:33.300> you<00:02:33.360> have<00:02:33.480> a<00:02:33.510> number

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
back and forth and if you have a number

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.410 
back and forth and if you have a number
of<00:02:33.930> bobbles<00:02:34.440> across<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:35.190> row<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.790> gets<00:02:36.000> to<00:02:36.180> be

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
of bobbles across the row it gets to be

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.520 
of bobbles across the row it gets to be
a<00:02:36.630> big<00:02:37.260> pain<00:02:37.500> in<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> rear<00:02:37.860> so<00:02:38.310> what<00:02:38.550> can<00:02:38.700> be

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
a big pain in the rear so what can be

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.229 
a big pain in the rear so what can be
more<00:02:40.530> efficient<00:02:41.040> is<00:02:41.190> to<00:02:41.430> knit<00:02:41.640> across<00:02:41.790> those

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
more efficient is to knit across those

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:42.860 
more efficient is to knit across those
stitches

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
stitches

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.970 
stitches
backwards<00:02:43.709> so<00:02:44.540> you<00:02:45.560> enter<00:02:46.560> the<00:02:46.709> stitch

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
backwards so you enter the stitch

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.040 
backwards so you enter the stitch
through<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.519> center<00:02:47.850> as<00:02:48.150> you<00:02:48.330> would<00:02:48.540> normally

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.050 
through the center as you would normally

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.880 
through the center as you would normally
but<00:02:49.470> you're<00:02:50.660> you're<00:02:51.660> pushing<00:02:52.410> the<00:02:52.590> left

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
but you're you're pushing the left

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.770 
but you're you're pushing the left
needle<00:02:53.160> through<00:02:53.580> the<00:02:54.060> stitch<00:02:54.300> on<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.569> right

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
needle through the stitch on the right

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.710 
needle through the stitch on the right
needle<00:02:55.050> so<00:02:55.800> it<00:02:55.860> goes<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.730> the<00:02:56.880> center<00:02:57.209> pushing

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
needle so it goes to the center pushing

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.570 
needle so it goes to the center pushing
against<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.170> back<00:02:58.470> loop<00:02:58.830> and<00:03:00.140> then<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.860> wrap

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
against the back loop and then you wrap

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.530 
against the back loop and then you wrap
the<00:03:02.819> yarn<00:03:02.850> around<00:03:03.590> that<00:03:04.590> left<00:03:04.890> needle<00:03:05.540> counter

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
the yarn around that left needle counter

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.690 
the yarn around that left needle counter
clockwise<00:03:07.320> just<00:03:07.950> like<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.250> would<00:03:08.430> if<00:03:08.549> you

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
clockwise just like you would if you

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.090 
clockwise just like you would if you
were<00:03:09.230> wrapping<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.350> around<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.680> right<00:03:10.829> needle

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
were wrapping it around the right needle

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.440 
were wrapping it around the right needle
and<00:03:11.280> doing<00:03:11.549> normal<00:03:12.090> forward<00:03:12.780> knitting<00:03:13.110> and

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
and doing normal forward knitting and

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.460 
and doing normal forward knitting and
then<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.890> come<00:03:16.890> off<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.730> stitch<00:03:18.170> so<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.230> go

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
then you come off the stitch so you go

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.090 
then you come off the stitch so you go
through<00:03:19.970> wrap<00:03:20.970> counterclockwise<00:03:21.860> pull<00:03:22.860> that

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
through wrap counterclockwise pull that

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.220 
through wrap counterclockwise pull that
loop<00:03:23.370> through<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:24.000> hit<00:03:24.510> take<00:03:24.750> it<00:03:24.900> off<00:03:25.019> the

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
loop through and hit take it off the

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.090 
loop through and hit take it off the
needle<00:03:26.930> so<00:03:27.930> I've<00:03:28.019> got<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.320> do<00:03:28.410> three<00:03:28.739> more<00:03:28.769> of

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
needle so I've got to do three more of

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.450 
needle so I've got to do three more of
these

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:38.280 

my<00:03:36.460> anchor<00:03:37.270> my<00:03:37.420> right<00:03:37.630> needle<00:03:37.840> so<00:03:38.110> it's<00:03:38.230> a

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
my anchor my right needle so it's a

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.320 
my anchor my right needle so it's a
little<00:03:38.530> awkward

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.330 
little awkward

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.750 
little awkward
when<00:03:40.330> I<00:03:40.360> have<00:03:40.540> camera<00:03:41.110> in<00:03:41.920> between<00:03:42.280> me<00:03:42.460> and<00:03:42.640> my

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
when I have camera in between me and my

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:53.430 
when I have camera in between me and my
knitting<00:03:48.750> there<00:03:49.750> we<00:03:49.840> go<00:03:49.990> okay<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:52.110> I've<00:03:53.110> knit

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
knitting there we go okay so I've knit

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:54.870 
knitting there we go okay so I've knit
those<00:03:53.590> backwards<00:03:54.160> and<00:03:54.370> now<00:03:54.490> I'm<00:03:54.640> going<00:03:54.820> to

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
those backwards and now I'm going to

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.850 
those backwards and now I'm going to
knit<00:03:55.000> them<00:03:55.830> normally<00:03:56.830> again<00:03:57.160> so<00:03:57.520> one<00:03:58.860> two

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
knit them normally again so one two

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:08.910 
knit them normally again so one two
three<00:04:01.050> four<00:04:05.370> five<00:04:06.370> um<00:04:07.620> if<00:04:08.620> you're<00:04:08.890> a

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
three four five um if you're a

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.290 
three four five um if you're a
continental<00:04:09.730> knitter<00:04:09.880> uh

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:12.300 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.150 

and<00:04:13.300> I<00:04:13.450> can't<00:04:13.750> I<00:04:13.930> can<00:04:14.320> knit<00:04:14.470> continental<00:04:14.680> I

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
and I can't I can knit continental I

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.890 
and I can't I can knit continental I
cannot<00:04:15.430> knit<00:04:15.640> continental<00:04:15.850> backwards<00:04:16.660> but

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
cannot knit continental backwards but

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.150 
cannot knit continental backwards but
I'm<00:04:16.989> just<00:04:17.230> going<00:04:17.440> to<00:04:17.500> show<00:04:17.709> you<00:04:17.739> what<00:04:18.010> you'd

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
I'm just going to show you what you'd

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.280 
I'm just going to show you what you'd
have<00:04:18.280> to<00:04:18.340> do<00:04:18.609> we<00:04:18.760> normally<00:04:19.330> you<00:04:19.630> have<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:20.019> yarn

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
have to do we normally you have the yarn

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.160 
have to do we normally you have the yarn
in<00:04:20.440> your<00:04:20.470> left<00:04:20.620> hand<00:04:21.070> like<00:04:21.700> this<00:04:22.080> when<00:04:23.080> you

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:23.170 
in your left hand like this when you

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:26.010 
in your left hand like this when you
enter<00:04:23.440> the<00:04:23.590> stitch<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.940> yarn<00:04:25.300> has<00:04:25.600> to<00:04:25.810> come

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
enter the stitch this yarn has to come

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.780 
enter the stitch this yarn has to come
around<00:04:27.480> counterclockwise<00:04:29.040> so<00:04:30.040> you<00:04:30.100> can't

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
around counterclockwise so you can't

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.720 
around counterclockwise so you can't
pick<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.270> yarn<00:04:31.780> because<00:04:32.200> the<00:04:32.590> needle<00:04:33.580> you'll

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
pick the yarn because the needle you'll

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.300 
pick the yarn because the needle you'll
be<00:04:33.940> picking<00:04:34.360> with<00:04:34.510> is<00:04:34.660> over<00:04:34.810> here<00:04:35.260> so<00:04:35.860> instead

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
be picking with is over here so instead

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.659 
be picking with is over here so instead
you<00:04:36.670> have<00:04:36.910> to<00:04:37.090> bring<00:04:37.950> right<00:04:38.950> you<00:04:39.130> have<00:04:39.280> to<00:04:39.430> wrap

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
you have to bring right you have to wrap

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.270 
you have to bring right you have to wrap
the<00:04:40.630> yarn<00:04:40.660> around<00:04:41.050> the<00:04:41.290> needle<00:04:41.350> and<00:04:41.860> because

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:42.280 
the yarn around the needle and because

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.010 
the yarn around the needle and because
of<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.610> way<00:04:42.730> I<00:04:42.760> attention<00:04:43.300> the<00:04:43.390> yarn<00:04:43.630> and<00:04:43.840> knit

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
of the way I attention the yarn and knit

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.370 
of the way I attention the yarn and knit
continental<00:04:44.260> I<00:04:44.980> just<00:04:45.850> I<00:04:46.060> just<00:04:46.540> can't<00:04:46.750> do<00:04:46.960> it<00:04:46.990> so

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
continental I just I just can't do it so

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.070 
continental I just I just can't do it so
that<00:04:47.740> you<00:04:47.890> but<00:04:48.100> the<00:04:48.190> yarn<00:04:48.400> has<00:04:48.610> to<00:04:48.760> come<00:04:48.940> around

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
that you but the yarn has to come around

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:55.830 
that you but the yarn has to come around
this<00:04:50.080> way<00:04:50.140> if<00:04:50.790> you<00:04:51.790> were<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:54.150> switch<00:04:55.150> the<00:04:55.600> yarn

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
this way if you were to switch the yarn

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:00.330 
this way if you were to switch the yarn
to<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.169> other<00:04:56.320> hand<00:04:58.830> so<00:04:59.830> that<00:04:59.860> you<00:05:00.190> were

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
to the other hand so that you were

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.190 
to the other hand so that you were
mirroring<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.540> way<00:05:01.690> that<00:05:01.960> you<00:05:02.080> were

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:02.200 
mirroring the way that you were

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.159 
mirroring the way that you were
tensioning<00:05:02.770> the<00:05:02.800> yarn<00:05:03.570> again<00:05:04.570> the<00:05:05.020> yarn

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:05.169 
tensioning the yarn again the yarn

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:06.540 
tensioning the yarn again the yarn
because<00:05:05.380> the<00:05:05.680> yarn<00:05:05.770> has<00:05:06.040> to<00:05:06.160> come<00:05:06.340> around

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 
because the yarn has to come around

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.280 
because the yarn has to come around
counterclockwise<00:05:07.169> you<00:05:08.169> need<00:05:09.040> to<00:05:09.990> it<00:05:10.990> would<00:05:11.140> be

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:11.290 
counterclockwise you need to it would be

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:15.450 
counterclockwise you need to it would be
hard<00:05:11.530> to<00:05:12.190> pick<00:05:12.730> because<00:05:13.270> the<00:05:14.110> yarn<00:05:14.620> needs<00:05:15.250> to

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
hard to pick because the yarn needs to

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:18.380 
hard to pick because the yarn needs to
be<00:05:15.610> held<00:05:15.850> kind<00:05:16.720> of<00:05:16.810> down<00:05:17.110> in<00:05:17.140> order<00:05:17.620> for<00:05:18.160> you<00:05:18.310> to

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
be held kind of down in order for you to

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.600 
be held kind of down in order for you to
to<00:05:19.390> bring<00:05:19.600> the<00:05:19.750> loop<00:05:19.990> through<00:05:20.610> um<00:05:21.610> if<00:05:21.790> you<00:05:22.780> are

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:23.610 
to bring the loop through um if you are

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.580 
to bring the loop through um if you are
a<00:05:25.950> combined<00:05:26.950> net<00:05:27.160> or<00:05:27.430> though<00:05:28.020> so<00:05:29.020> that<00:05:29.200> your

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
a combined net or though so that your

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.250 
a combined net or though so that your
pearls<00:05:30.190> always<00:05:30.610> end<00:05:30.940> up<00:05:31.210> mounting<00:05:32.140> the

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
pearls always end up mounting the

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.320 
pearls always end up mounting the
stitches<00:05:32.650> in<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.830> opposite<00:05:33.160> direction<00:05:33.330> you

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
stitches in the opposite direction you

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:39.210 
stitches in the opposite direction you
could<00:05:34.630> pick<00:05:34.930> this<00:05:35.770> way<00:05:36.070> and<00:05:37.560> that<00:05:38.560> will<00:05:38.830> leave

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:39.220 
could pick this way and that will leave

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.770 
could pick this way and that will leave
the<00:05:39.400> stitches<00:05:39.790> mounted<00:05:40.210> the<00:05:40.330> way<00:05:40.450> that<00:05:40.630> you're

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
the stitches mounted the way that you're

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.590 
the stitches mounted the way that you're
used<00:05:41.080> to<00:05:41.229> with<00:05:41.729> the<00:05:42.729> right<00:05:42.880> leg<00:05:43.120> in<00:05:43.270> the<00:05:43.300> back

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 
used to with the right leg in the back

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.860 
used to with the right leg in the back
and<00:05:43.960> the<00:05:44.560> left<00:05:44.740> leg<00:05:44.950> in<00:05:45.100> front

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
and the left leg in front

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:50.400 
and the left leg in front
and<00:05:46.870> that's<00:05:47.440> how<00:05:47.590> you<00:05:47.650> knit<00:05:47.920> backwards
