00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.689
 very good I'm nico and in this video 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.589
 let's see how to synchronize movies 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:14.589
 through itunes 11 to the iphone ipad or ipod 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:16.869
 touch the player of the device that 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:19.270
 integra apple by default is called win 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.730
 htein player and supports very few 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.530
 movie formats these 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:25.270
 characteristics we can see in the 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.580
 official page of apple in the 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.400
 technical specifications of the own 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.340
 device that can happen that 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.070
 we want to reproduce a format that is not 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.380
 compatible for example a movie with 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.020
 abi container format that is the most 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.940
 used and for that we'll have to 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.030
 use another method that also we 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.329
 we will comment first let's see how 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.739
 synchronize compatible formats what 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.350
 more important that you have to have in 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:55.540
 account is that they can only be synchronized 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.079
 the multimedia files with a 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.940
 iTunes library that is if I 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.250
 I connect my device to a computer 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.500
 to synchronize it with itunes it was coming 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.420
 to synchronize it with a different one 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.950
 a warning will appear indicating that 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.049
 without continuous 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.689
 these files can be deleted 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.500
 access the movies section in 

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.540
 iTunes in this section that we see here 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.100
 we can have music by default 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.080
 we select movies but I 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.960
 I recommend entering inside 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.670
 display show sidebar and now 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.180
 it appears in the sidebar of the 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.010
 left this section of movies if 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.020
 we want to add in movie files 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.320
 to the iTunes library we can 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.150
 perform in various ways for example 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.340
 a computer folder that we have 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.430
 We drag the film to the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.619
 iTunes library and let's go on this 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.570
 case they do not appear by default inside the 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.640
 movie section would have to enter 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.590
 in not seen and they will appear here 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.740
 we can do this both in windows 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:02:00.009
 as in mac and then we can also 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.850
 perform differently in mac within the 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:08.320
 File add to library or command 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:11.110
 or and it already gives us the option to look for a 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.970
 file inside the computer to 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.280
 select it 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.400
 we would solve it click to open and now 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.410
 he adds it to us in windows we would have to 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.890
 enter inside file and it gives us the 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.110
 option to add file the library or 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.880
 control oo add folders to the 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.620
 library if we have several files in 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.960
 a folder and we select this we 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.120
 would pass all the files that we have 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.010
 in it we can also drag as 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.950
 we were commenting from a folder of the 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:42.120
 itunes computer that can happen that 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.340
 if we try to drag 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.230
 a file that is not compatible in this 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.629
 case for example we see that it is a file 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.340
 skillful will not allow us the form of 

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.620
 synchronize these files what 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.739
 we will explain later you can 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.049
 synchronize videos in two ways 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:59.940
 manually or automatically 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.800
 difference is the following within the 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.310
 summary tab 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.640
 if we check this box and press 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.640
 Apply 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:12.310
 and we entered inside the section of videos 

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:15.580
 we can drag them directly to the 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:18.880
 device and they pass us 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:21.570
 we can also select several and 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.570
 drag them 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.560
 the only thing that every time we add more 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.829
 files to the library we have to 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:34.200
 walk one by one passing the other 

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:36.150
 form inside the device in the 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.579
 music section if we mark is 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:41.099
 check the first thing that will appear 

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.859
 is a message indicating that all 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:45.389
 music content movies 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:48.359
 television programs books and tones 

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:50.250
 is going to be eliminated because we already come from 

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.639
 synchronize manually we're going to 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.859
 press you have to bear in mind that if 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:57.629
 we have a lot of data and what 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.389
 we change is going to be eliminated and then 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:03.629
 we would have to start over 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:05.520
 click to apply and they are already removed from the 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:08.220
 device 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.420
 we see here that we see four the 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.400
 advantage is that we do not have to 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.200
 drag them manually every time 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.950
 that we add movies and synchronize 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.440
 they are going well now if we come from 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:21.239
 synchronize it automatically and 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:23.790
 we enter within the summary section 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:26.760
 and check this box when pressing 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.760
 apply I do not get rid of movies 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.410
 they are only deleted if we come to manage 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.620
 the music and videos manually and 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:37.440
 we check the box automatically 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.600
 Now let's explain how to pass 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.370
 to the device files that are not 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.890
 compatible with the player next 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.740
 by default for example avi formats 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:49.320
 for this we would have to use another 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:51.570
 application different from the quick time 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.780
 player is not worth us where we can 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.030
 get it in the app store 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:05:00.950
 we enter for example in itunes store or 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:03.080
 in app store on the device we search 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:05.120
 knows 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:07.490
 and we see a lot of 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.280
 compatible players there are many 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:12.919
 free I for example I'm 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:15.650
 using this as much for the ipad as 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.840
 for the iphone as we spend these 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.270
 files to the device once 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.319
 installed the application and in this case 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.319
 I have to player 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.419
 is this that we see here we have to 

00:05:26.379 --> 00:05:30.220
 enter inside the device in the 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:32.169
 application section and in the part 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:36.030
 below we see the applications 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:38.850
 with which you can share files 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:41.160
 we select the application and here 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.740
 we can simply select add 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:47.100
 we go to the folder where we have the 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.900
 application we select it and press 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.330
 open 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:53.669
 and already starts at the top the 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.790
 transfer of the computer to 

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:55.790
 device 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.550
 of course the device has to 

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:02.949
 to be connected we can also 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:05.889
 drag in a folder on the computer 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:09.520
 where we have that video in avi format 

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:11.800
 we drag it this transfer 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.810
 files to the applications with which 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.449
 you can share files we can 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:19.330
 do from any computer does not 

00:06:16.449 --> 00:06:21.370
 it is always necessary to do it in the same 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.080
 that we connect it, we enter inside the 

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.419
 device in applications and in the 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.919
 bottom part already appears all the 

00:06:25.419 --> 00:06:29.110
 applications with which you can 

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:31.930
 share files and simply the 

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.680
 we drag and it is not erased absolutely 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.050
 nothing 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:37.880
 and this is all we hope you have 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.680
