00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.250 
like this so it's going to blow up right
there<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.120> it's<00:01:48.420> not<00:01:48.660> going<00:01:48.870> to<00:01:48.960> bind<00:01:49.140> your

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
there so it's not going to bind your

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:50.720 
there so it's not going to bind your
teammates<00:01:49.680> but<00:01:49.980> it's<00:01:50.130> going<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.310> blind<00:01:50.580> it

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
teammates but it's going to blind it

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.070 
teammates but it's going to blind it
anyone<00:01:51.120> that's<00:01:51.330> trying<00:01:51.570> to<00:01:51.720> fight<00:01:51.930> your

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.870 
anyone that's trying to fight your

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
teammates so these flashes these late

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.080 
teammates so these flashes these late
