will actually help out with the search
engine<00:01:16.259> optimization<00:01:17.119> again<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.299> read

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
engine optimization again you can read

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.840 
engine optimization again you can read
the<00:01:18.720> full<00:01:18.750> policies<00:01:19.409> here<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:20.400> when<00:01:20.580> you<00:01:20.670> want

to go to the next one once you've done
it<00:01:22.140> will<00:01:22.380> automatically<00:01:22.979> do<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.729> if<00:01:23.850> you

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
it will automatically do that but if you

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.530 
it will automatically do that but if you

need to go to the next one just just

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.050 
need to go to the next one just just
click<00:01:27.780> here<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:29.189> will<00:01:29.250> go<00:01:29.460> along<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.939> the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
click here and it will go along to the

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.609 
click here and it will go along to the
next<00:01:33.320> next<00:01:34.320> user<00:01:35.180> okay<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.960> again<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.530> a

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
next next user okay and again it's a

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.359 
next next user okay and again it's a
fairly<00:01:37.829> simple<00:01:37.950> process<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:40.189> really<00:01:41.189> really

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
fairly simple process that really really

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.289 
fairly simple process that really really
helps<00:01:41.790> with<00:01:41.970> search<00:01:42.240> engine<00:01:42.689> optimization<00:01:43.530> so

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
helps with search engine optimization so

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.710 
helps with search engine optimization so
RSS<00:01:45.299> feeds<00:01:45.600> are<00:01:45.780> unknown<00:01:46.079> source<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.920> getting

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
RSS feeds are unknown source of getting

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.350 
RSS feeds are unknown source of getting
helping<00:01:48.720> you<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.079> good<00:01:49.259> rankings<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.549> go

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
helping you to get good rankings so go

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.840 
helping you to get good rankings so go
and<00:01:51.540> do<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.689> it's<00:01:52.140> very<00:01:52.860> very<00:01:53.159> simple<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.700> do

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
and do that it's very very simple to do

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.910 
and do that it's very very simple to do
and<00:01:53.880> it's<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.450> piece<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:54.960> most<00:01:55.320> people<00:01:55.680> leave

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
and it's a piece that most people leave

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.770 
and it's a piece that most people leave
out<00:01:56.130> that's<00:01:56.490> why<00:01:56.700> we<00:01:56.880> put<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> software

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
out that's why we put it in the software

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.899 
out that's why we put it in the software
so<00:01:58.590> that<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.070> actually<00:01:59.219> get<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.759> it

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
so that you can actually get to it

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.170 
so that you can actually get to it
easily<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.509> do<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.810> easily<00:02:01.850> that's<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:03.030> for

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
easily and do it easily that's it for

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.690 
easily and do it easily that's it for
this<00:02:03.270> video<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.659> we'll<00:02:04.500> see<00:02:04.649> you<00:02:04.680> on<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.670> next
