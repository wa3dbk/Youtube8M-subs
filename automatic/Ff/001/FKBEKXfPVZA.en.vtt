big<00:01:34.409> fun2draw<00:01:34.680> eye<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.549> because<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.479> L<00:01:36.750> is

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
big fun2draw eye and because this L is

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.350 
big fun2draw eye and because this L is
kind<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.380> turning<00:01:37.950> its<00:01:38.130> head<00:01:38.250> towards<00:01:39.030> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
kind of turning its head towards the

kind of turning its head towards the
side<00:01:39.689> we're<00:01:40.110> only<00:01:40.320> going<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.590> see<00:01:40.799> one<00:01:40.909> find<00:01:41.909> it

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
side we're only going to see one find it

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.780 
side we're only going to see one find it
your<00:01:42.090> eye<00:01:42.619> so<00:01:43.619> I<00:01:43.649> have<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.950> leaf<00:01:44.130> shape<00:01:44.159> like

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
your eye so I have the leaf shape like

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.450 
your eye so I have the leaf shape like
that<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.360> let's<00:01:45.960> draw<00:01:46.170> one<00:01:46.439> more<00:01:46.470> line<00:01:47.040> going

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
that and let's draw one more line going

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.460 
that and let's draw one more line going
down<00:01:49.939> so<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.000> like<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.210> shade<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.720> this<00:01:51.899> part<00:01:52.200> to

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
down so I like to shade in this part to

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.539 
down so I like to shade in this part to
make<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.860> side<00:01:53.210> really<00:01:54.210> nice<00:01:54.570> and<00:01:54.840> dark<00:01:55.020> I

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
make that side really nice and dark I

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:57.620 
make that side really nice and dark I
think<00:01:56.549> that<00:01:56.700> really<00:01:56.909> helps<00:01:57.299> the<00:01:57.390> eye<00:01:57.570> stand

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
think that really helps the eye stand

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.030 
think that really helps the eye stand
