00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:08.970
 but we are going to work today with patinas 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:12.870
 let's show how the patinas are used 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.820
 about wood with grain then we 're going 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.789
 to do fast to take advantage of the 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.160
 I'm working with different 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.180
 colors of courtyards and I will work with 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.920
 a hard bristle brush and it 's like 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.770
 this work could be said that by son 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.210
 but good and I think nothing or nothing 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:40.139
 wood is rough the only thing that has 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.659
 it is a little bit of sandpaper enough sandpaper to 

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:46.240
 that is very soft and what I'm going to 

00:00:42.659 --> 00:00:49.360
 to do is to pass dark colors 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:53.440
 of skating and now you will know that simple 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.950
 we are going to remove the sight, nothing else is 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.860
 with some sectors left I do not think 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.910
 to close not because now what I do 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.910
 days settle 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.910
 A) Yes 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:13.729
 but not in clay the colors of the left 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.880
 more or less in the place where the sweets 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:20.830
 they are based soccer melting exactly if 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.830
 I'm going to mix it a little bit 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:32.009
 I accommodate them and now what I do with a 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:35.369
 clean rag 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.369
 I'm going to start 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.710
 rub to start removing the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.470
 over this 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.470
 to remove the end and removal 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.260
 more or less is does a range that 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.750
 it will work well that the colors are good 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:00.420
 cognitive the idea of ​​the function swear 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.280
 that if you can put the colors that you 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.860
 like me I like these for a 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.710
 just follow the line of the box that 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:12.870
 already suit watches the retreat but about the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.520
 place not to smear the colors of 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.920
 they want the colors that I put on 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:23.989
 see even use a borravino that I have 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.989
 as a violent clear tool 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.580
 and there it starts to appear since the 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.600
 surplus 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.520
 and now what I do is illustrate by the 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.920
 solar so that the vein appears so that 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.890
 the vein seems like retirement everything I can 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.480
 then the color of the page is already 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.909
 fixed you see 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:53.940
 And here what I do is remove everything 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.940
 can so that the goal mate 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:04.800
 It's fast and economical that good for 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:06.870
 make furniture that we give to the patinas 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.630
 directly directly on the way ni 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.910
 nothing terrific maybe this town and 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.060
 Now what I do is show and remove 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.270
 all the surplus 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.160
 I force the mowing to penetrate 

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.610
 because these pages are elaborated 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.480
 with waxes 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.860
 reid until I fight again to 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.650
 once dried it that 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.880
 so you do not need more protection if 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.810
 you want in big doubles what 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:38.950
 you can do is do a job 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.950
 good clever 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:51.130
 you have to do force but that is worth the 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.130
 penalty in the next with another job
