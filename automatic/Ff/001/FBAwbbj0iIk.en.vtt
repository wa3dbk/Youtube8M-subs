the things I'm adding to the page
I<00:01:37.130> was<00:01:37.939> then<00:01:38.119> trying<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.659> attach<00:01:39.110> some<00:01:39.470> sort<00:01:39.740> of

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:39.799 
I was then trying to attach some sort of

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:42.130 
I was then trying to attach some sort of
tab<00:01:40.100> to<00:01:40.369> this<00:01:40.490> piece<00:01:40.670> of<00:01:40.820> card<00:01:41.060> so<00:01:41.659> it<00:01:41.960> could<00:01:42.080> be

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
tab to this piece of card so it could be

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.109 
tab to this piece of card so it could be
pulled<00:01:42.470> out<00:01:42.619> the<00:01:42.799> peg<00:01:42.979> bag<00:01:43.220> easier<00:01:43.729> but<00:01:44.090> I

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
pulled out the peg bag easier but I

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.420 
pulled out the peg bag easier but I
decided<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.659> card<00:01:44.869> was<00:01:45.110> too<00:01:45.380> short<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.400> I

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
decided the card was too short and so I

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.100 
decided the card was too short and so I
found<00:01:46.759> this<00:01:46.909> other<00:01:47.090> piece<00:01:47.420> of<00:01:47.450> card<00:01:47.750> which<00:01:47.960> was
