00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 how am i with the same super 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.750
 pixel and today we are going to do the unboxing of 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.730
 the kaiser momentum yesterday to 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.500
 those who do not know the moments that 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.139
 would come to be the version a little bit more 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.480
 small of the moment moments 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.190
 only momentum from sennheiser we are going to 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.890
 see what we have here in the other's box 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.210
 side where we're going to find the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.740
 description and specifications 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.850
 techniques that we're going to see some because 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.550
 it is important that we take into account 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.199
 this because they are headphones say 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.109
 high-end we have an answer in 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.210
 frequency of 16 to 22 thousand hertz thing that 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.370
 it's pretty good since we have a 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.320
 impedance of 1811 so if I what 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.360
 we will use with an ipod or a 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.129
 phone will be able to hear a 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.450
 little bit stronger than it is and for example 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.219
 we had a slightly higher impedance 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.840
 of course I also imagine that you 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.610
 impedance was measured although the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.829
 hurts obviously we have a distortion 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.120
 total harmonic of less than 0.5 per 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.610
 one hundred of course measure yet 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.960
 keyloggers and 100 decibels the pattern 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.489
 of the pickup the microphone is 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.530
 omnidirectional and also a 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.170
 sensitivity of minus 44 must per bolt 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.760
 by pascal the truth that 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.839
 same specifications we will see that 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.869
 what we have inside the box 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.340
 there got here is we 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.470
 we take this stage we are here 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.869
 with the case that we are going to take it out and 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.250
 we have manuals here that we are not going to 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.009
 achieve because they want by manual tones 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.330
 we have here the case that is 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.310
 pretty good it looks like it 's finished 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.530
 with different style of leatherette or plush 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.899
 I 'm not value is hill is like the 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.479
 fabric that is plush and this music is to say 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:28.950
 it is hard for the bottom part of stage and 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.350
 then up until with music work 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.300
 with the classic made type from in hi be 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.610
 and then we have here a closing with some 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.190
 plastic sticks we are going to open them and 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.039
 what do we find ourselves in with another 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.899
 coolest bag and also with cables 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:45.600
 now that we have the cables behind 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:49.049
 to see a little more closely this is a 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.280
 plan with four poles which I 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.720
 he says he would come to have the microphone 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.840
 I almost have to have control here 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.670
 with a microphone and this is a blog with 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.700
 three forums so there should be 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.460
 only sounds as well as not just going 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.659
 let's see we're going to open it this nice because 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.320
 we all want to know what is there 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.450
 here inside and what color came to us very 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.210
 great, let's bring the 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.190
 zoom to this and we have one in termination 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.420
 very well done forgiveness in very heaven 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.620
 fast because I'm very cold and 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.540
 apart because it recontra delicious of 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.810
 try these headphones the termination 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:23.090
 is great is very well achieved with what 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.890
 that would come to look like leather or 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.320
 as if it were leather but with a 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.880
 sort of plush and they are pretty 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.050
 little ones are a little more noticeable 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.480
 that the moments are not original 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.280
 logically it says on the box and and 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.410
 we knew it at the beginning and articulated 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.270
 pretty good so later we go 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.500
 to see the full analysis in supra 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.880
 pixel where are we going to talk about how it 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.160
 feels in the ear after a few 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.560
 long hours of listening and of course 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.300
 that the abe of the sound quality well 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.300
 that we see in future videos 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.510
 but you have 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.140
 You know why you're here, do not watch the video 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:59.140
 when you subscribed 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.010
 ah
