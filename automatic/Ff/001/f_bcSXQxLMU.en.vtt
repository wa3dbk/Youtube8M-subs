00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.340
 hello everyone here ribolzi 

00:00:02.489 --> 00:00:07.350
 welcome to a new video and here you 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.820
 I bring as promised the second 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.709
 tutorial of the second in motion 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.599
 technical first of all really 

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.039
 thank you for your support in the first 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.230
 video I think it has been one of the videos 

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.760
 most voted I have and this certainly 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.710
 encourages me to keep making videos of 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.050
 quality to continue making tutorials 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.730
 tried to help so do not hesitate 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.500
 vote on the videos that you like because 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.360
 It also helps to share the real ones 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.010
 thank you very much to all and here you 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.750
 I bring with a fiancÃ© the second 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.540
 technical movement that is a movement 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.430
 very very easy to use but that 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.410
 It also requires a bit of technique and 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.960
 let's see below it's about 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.150
 the the roll out or the fact of stepping on 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.579
 ball to the right or to the 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.770
 left and this movement has this 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.810
 technical movement is used a little 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.550
 as a bridge to other movements 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.680
 technicians but let's concentrate on 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.440
 this video simply in the fact 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.540
 step on the ball and let's find the 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.820
 utility to this technical movement for 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.520
 do this we need a player with 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.890
 two stars of technical gestures or more 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.640
 so any field player can 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.890
 use it 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.920
 goalkeeper so you have no excuse for not 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.200
 really use it and if it's done 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.080
 this way you have to press the button 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:19.869
 elite or button on 2 in xbox on 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.250
 station 3 and hit the right stick towards 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:22.900
 the left if we want to think the ball 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.240
 to the left or to the right if 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.070
 we want to step on it to the right 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.420
 well let's find it useful to this 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.840
 technical movement and is that this 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:34.650
 movement is really very very useful if 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.270
 it is accompanied by a change of address 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.920
 abrupt just after stepping on the ball 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.800
 let's give an example for example 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.570
 let's move on here let's step on 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.640
 the ball and let's make a change 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.470
 direction to the right and we're going to 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.300
 do the same for example now stepping 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.910
 the ball toward right and changing 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.399
 address quickly and this really 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.890
 which is very useful because you leave the opponent in 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:59.110
 the stockade because I tried to think you're going 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.780
 to go up and then change 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.040
 of direction down and just 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.110
 is 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.720
 it's very very useful, we're really going to see it 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.100
 in the examples I've played a game and I've 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.290
 tried to make this technical move 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.600
 to really teach you examples in a 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.410
 party because I know it's not easy to 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.580
 understand simply by seeing the change of 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.500
 direction is simply made 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.050
 holding the button 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.630
 modification in lte or l2 after 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.310
 do the after stepping on the ball and 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.890
 changing direction with the stick 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.110
 left and really that is a 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.090
 technical movement is very very very useful 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.459
 for especially to try to become a 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.990
 hollow for the shot trying to leave 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:41.800
 the rival in the lurch as I said 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:42.730
 it's really useful and then there's another 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.340
 useful also to this movement 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.300
 technical that is the fact of being able 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.490
 haggle for example to the goalkeeper 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.590
 just stepping on the ball and this already 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:52.660
 is that of a little more than 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.640
 timing of has a bit more of 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.720
 difficulty but let's try it let's go 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.120
 to try to decant the portento 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.930
 simply stepping on the ball has taken 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.640
 time to do it 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.410
 to step on the ball, let's try 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.600
 again 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.560
 kissing the ball you can go 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.200
 goalkeeper you can go from any 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:11.480
 player trying to make an entry 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.790
 but it requires a bit more timing 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.650
 a little more I do not know 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.719
 it's a bit more difficult but the fact 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.969
 simply to change direction 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:24.299
 after stepping on the ball is really 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:27.540
 very useful and very few people know it 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:29.879
 knows how to take advantage and nothing will leave you with 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.459
 two videos with the video that I made 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.870
 a match trying to do this 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.030
 technical movement all the time and of 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.549
 truth teaches you 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.189
 It shows us a little that it is useful 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.349
 Do not be afraid to use it like that 

00:03:41.189 --> 00:03:45.120
 that nothing if you have liked the life 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.739
 habits subscribe and follow me in 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.519
 twitter and nothing we see in the next 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:49.519
 chao video 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.510
 just as it is 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.750
 and 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.830
 and 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.710
 Uruguay
