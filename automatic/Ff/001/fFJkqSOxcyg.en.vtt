00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.450
 in today's video I'll show you how 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.770
 Vicente painter to carryons and those that 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.379
 you have long since you will know that 

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:15.240
 I've been doing it for two years on request 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.710
 but this year decided that I'm not going to 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.930
 repeat the experience and as you are 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.029
 many who write me and even me 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.560
 emails have arrived in winter 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.050
 wondering about her interested in 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.539
 she therefore decided to make this video for 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.550
 to see how I do it and to see that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.380
 it is not very difficult simply that it is a 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.610
 little entertaining I also bring you a 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.540
 draw so they stayed until the end 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.540
 of the video to see it 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.360
 The first thing I do is cut the ends 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:42.130
 of wicker that are left over so that 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.060
 surface that I'm going to paint then I'll 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.060
 as smooth as possible 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.880
 i 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.270
 now I put steel ink all over the 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.780
 edge and it is not necessary that it be 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.780
 the perfect 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.710
 I make sure it is securely attached to 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.710
 that the paint does not come out 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.650
 Now I'm going to start painting and for that 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.180
 He used matt acrylic paints and 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.310
 local viewed my previous designs 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.310
 You will know that I always choose pastel shades 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.740
 although it does not look like it is difficult to paint 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.659
 the wicker no gaps so 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.789
 firm bristle brushes I use and I 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.140
 painting doing circles in this way 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.520
 the painting will go well into the 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:36.119
 surface and it will be completely 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.119
 cover 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.410
 5 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.900
 ah 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.330
 When the paint is dry, I remove the 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.330
 masking tape 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.550
 it's time to make the drawings and 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.620
 the most comfortable and easy way to do it 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.659
 it is with template you can buy it now 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.890
 done or do it yourselves with a 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:08.890
 plastic sheet as they say 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.420
 so that the paint does not get out of the 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.700
 template it is important to catch little 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:18.330
 amount and if then it is necessary to give a 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.330
 second layer 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.570
 finally I applied a layer of varnish 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.880
 mate to protect the paint a little and 

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:29.980
 that is not so easily deducts I 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.160
 I use this spray because it works 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.170
 more convenient to apply 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.170
 and now it's just left to dry 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.920
 another even more simple way and also 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.720
 very nice to decorate the carrycot is to do 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.310
 the drawings directly on the mind 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.310
 without putting any other background color 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.110
 to make the drawings with the template 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.770
 it is best to do the outline first and 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.770
 then fill 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.129
 if you use clear colors like me 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.959
 you will have to give two layers but you 

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.890
 you have to make sure that the first one already 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.890
 be well dry 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.430
 I personally prefer to draw 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.319
 simple as stars or hearts 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.910
 because in addition to being easier to 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.910
 do I think it's much nicer 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:31.939
 and now it will be explained in what 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.640
 consists of the draw and I'm going to 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:36.340
 ar jump 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.280
 this basket 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:41.280
 which is my favorite 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:46.800
 and I will explain the basis of the draw 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.180
 the support will be national and will have 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.320
 the duration of a week since I 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.670
 upload this video 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.200
 When the week passes announce the 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.700
 winner in social networks and also 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.610
