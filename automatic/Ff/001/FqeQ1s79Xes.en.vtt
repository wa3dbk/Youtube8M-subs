lens<00:01:03.170> line<00:01:03.469> because<00:01:04.040> a<00:01:04.070> lot<00:01:04.280> of<00:01:04.370> people<00:01:04.580> were

modifying their still lenses and they

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.590 
modifying their still lenses and they
felt<00:01:07.490> that<00:01:07.850> this<00:01:08.000> might<00:01:08.240> be<00:01:08.360> a<00:01:08.390> better

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600

alternative Tokina engineers didn't just

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:13.240 
alternative Tokina engineers didn't just
