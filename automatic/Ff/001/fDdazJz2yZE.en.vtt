your<00:02:42.880> picture<00:02:43.210> look<00:02:43.750> at<00:02:43.870> this

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
your picture look at this

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.250 
your picture look at this
yeah<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.190> cursor<00:02:45.850> goes<00:02:46.000> away<00:02:46.240> again<00:02:46.360> that

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
yeah the cursor goes away again that

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.680 
yeah the cursor goes away again that
means<00:02:47.530> so<00:02:47.890> so<00:02:48.700> that's<00:02:48.850> pretty<00:02:49.120> much<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.630> only

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
means so so that's pretty much the only

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.800 
means so so that's pretty much the only
workaround<00:02:50.530> for<00:02:50.590> this<00:02:51.210> is<00:02:52.210> to<00:02:52.360> go<00:02:52.480> back<00:02:52.690> to

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
workaround for this is to go back to

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.990 
workaround for this is to go back to
face<00:02:53.020> detection<00:02:53.410> unless<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.760> want<00:02:54.970> to

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
face detection unless you want to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.470 
face detection unless you want to
install<00:02:55.390> an<00:02:56.140> unofficial<00:02:56.620> dish<00:02:57.610> unless<00:02:58.330> you

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
install an unofficial dish unless you

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.340
