at<00:00:49.870> the<00:00:50.140> tree<00:00:50.320> so<00:00:50.710> you<00:00:50.800> can<00:00:50.920> see<00:00:51.040> how<00:00:51.190> extensive

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:51.910 
at the tree so you can see how extensive

that is so when you have hundreds or

that is so when you have hundreds or
