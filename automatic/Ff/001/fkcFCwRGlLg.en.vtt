00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:06.470 

hi<00:00:05.370> everyone<00:00:05.549> in<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:05.940> last<00:00:06.089> video<00:00:06.330> we

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
hi everyone in the last video we

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.480 
hi everyone in the last video we
finished<00:00:06.839> off<00:00:07.020> adding<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:07.830> rigid<00:00:08.069> bodies<00:00:08.340> for

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
finished off adding the rigid bodies for

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.360 
finished off adding the rigid bodies for
this<00:00:08.610> let<00:00:09.480> me<00:00:09.510> just<00:00:09.599> show<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.809> so<00:00:10.679> I<00:00:11.070> think

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
this let me just show you so I think

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.589 
this let me just show you so I think
this<00:00:11.550> looks<00:00:11.730> okay<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.000> mean<00:00:12.210> this<00:00:12.389> would<00:00:12.540> look

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
this looks okay I mean this would look

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.180 
this looks okay I mean this would look
way<00:00:12.780> better<00:00:12.929> if<00:00:13.320> it<00:00:13.500> was<00:00:13.590> done<00:00:13.740> by<00:00:13.860> an<00:00:13.920> artist

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
way better if it was done by an artist

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.560 
way better if it was done by an artist
but<00:00:14.549> I<00:00:15.420> think<00:00:16.080> it's<00:00:16.379> good<00:00:16.500> enough<00:00:16.529> anyway<00:00:17.250> so

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
but I think it's good enough anyway so

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.380 
but I think it's good enough anyway so
I'm<00:00:18.570> just<00:00:18.980> yeah<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:20.820> this<00:00:20.939> video<00:00:21.119> I<00:00:21.210> want<00:00:21.359> to

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
I'm just yeah in this video I want to

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.840 
I'm just yeah in this video I want to
talk<00:00:21.510> about<00:00:22.189> the<00:00:23.189> idea<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.609> blending

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
talk about the idea of blending

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.660 
talk about the idea of blending
animation<00:00:24.570> and<00:00:24.810> physics<00:00:25.199> so<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.400> do<00:00:26.550> this

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
animation and physics so to do this

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.490 
animation and physics so to do this
you'll<00:00:27.269> want<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.539> select<00:00:27.720> all<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.230> bodies

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
you'll want to select all the bodies

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.429 
you'll want to select all the bodies
using<00:00:28.740> ctrl<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:30.019> you<00:00:31.019> see<00:00:31.050> there's<00:00:31.320> this

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
using ctrl a and you see there's this

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.080 
using ctrl a and you see there's this
physics<00:00:32.160> type<00:00:32.369> which<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.759> haven't<00:00:32.910> really

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
physics type which we haven't really

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.389 
physics type which we haven't really
talked<00:00:33.360> about<00:00:33.420> so<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.200> here<00:00:34.350> you<00:00:34.500> have<00:00:34.649> default

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
talked about so in here you have default

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.880 
talked about so in here you have default
kinematic<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.239> simulated<00:00:36.719> an<00:00:36.840> idea<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.680> that

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
kinematic and simulated an idea is that

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.860 
kinematic and simulated an idea is that
each<00:00:38.399> one<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.700> these<00:00:38.820> rigid<00:00:39.120> bodies<00:00:39.420> it<00:00:39.690> can

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
each one of these rigid bodies it can

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.720 
each one of these rigid bodies it can
either<00:00:39.960> be<00:00:40.079> physically<00:00:40.710> simulated<00:00:41.190> animated

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
either be physically simulated animated

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.590 
either be physically simulated animated
or<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:42.360> blend<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:42.989> both<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:44.329> let's<00:00:45.329> go<00:00:45.420> ahead<00:00:45.510> and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
or a blend of both so let's go ahead and

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.049 
or a blend of both so let's go ahead and
set<00:00:45.840> that<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> kinematic<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.829> now<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.820> we<00:00:47.850> hit

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
set that to kinematic and now if we hit

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.119 
set that to kinematic and now if we hit
simulate<00:00:48.239> you'll<00:00:49.079> see<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.410> nothing<00:00:49.680> happens

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
simulate you'll see that nothing happens

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.830 
simulate you'll see that nothing happens
and<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.309> reason<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.730> we've<00:00:51.360> set<00:00:51.570> all<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
and the reason is that we've set all the

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.600 
and the reason is that we've set all the
rigid<00:00:52.079> bodies<00:00:52.379> to<00:00:52.530> be<00:00:52.620> kinematic<00:00:53.160> which<00:00:53.399> means

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
rigid bodies to be kinematic which means

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.209 
rigid bodies to be kinematic which means
that<00:00:53.850> it's<00:00:54.090> expecting<00:00:54.719> animation<00:00:55.350> so<00:00:55.860> over

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that it's expecting animation so over

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.670 
that it's expecting animation so over
here<00:00:56.460> in<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> animation<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.719> we<00:00:57.870> pick<00:00:58.079> walk

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
here in the animation if we pick walk

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.340 
here in the animation if we pick walk
you'll<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.670> that<00:00:59.820> it's<00:01:00.030> already<00:01:00.390> going<00:01:01.109> into

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
you'll see that it's already going into

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.160 
you'll see that it's already going into
the<00:01:01.500> right<00:01:01.620> pose<00:01:01.859> and<00:01:02.129> if<00:01:02.609> we<00:01:02.760> hit<00:01:02.850> play<00:01:03.170> you

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
the right pose and if we hit play you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.440 
the right pose and if we hit play you
can<00:01:04.290> see<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.559> he's<00:01:04.680> fully<00:01:05.070> animate<00:01:05.450> this

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
can see that he's fully animate this

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.090 
can see that he's fully animate this
gets<00:01:06.689> a<00:01:06.750> little<00:01:06.930> bit<00:01:07.049> more<00:01:07.229> interesting<00:01:07.619> if<00:01:07.830> we

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
gets a little bit more interesting if we

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.240 
gets a little bit more interesting if we
actually<00:01:08.490> have<00:01:08.909> a<00:01:08.939> combination<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:10.250> simulated

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
actually have a combination of simulated

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.310 
actually have a combination of simulated
and<00:01:11.430> animated<00:01:11.970> so<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.600> example<00:01:12.930> if<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.170> take

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
and animated so for example if we take

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.700 
and animated so for example if we take
the<00:01:13.680> lower<00:01:14.280> arm<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.570> palm<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.530> set

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
the lower arm and the palm and we set

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.999 
the lower arm and the palm and we set
them<00:01:16.830> to<00:01:16.979> be<00:01:17.240> default<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.560> now<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.619> hit

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
them to be default and now we hit

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.249 
them to be default and now we hit
simulate<00:01:20.360> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.479> see<00:01:21.630> nothing's<00:01:22.020> moving

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
simulate you can see nothing's moving

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.490 
simulate you can see nothing's moving
except<00:01:22.650> for<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.250> guy<00:01:23.900> but<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.140> actually

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
except for this guy but if we actually

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.480 
except for this guy but if we actually
hit<00:01:25.680> play<00:01:26.640> now<00:01:27.590> you<00:01:28.590> get<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.189> kind<00:01:29.460> of

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
hit play now you get this kind of

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.219 
hit play now you get this kind of
combination<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> two<00:01:30.450> and<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.720> can

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
combination of the two and you can

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.510 
combination of the two and you can
actually<00:01:31.350> come<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.740> here<00:01:31.920> into<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.220> physics

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
actually come in here into the physics

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.700 
actually come in here into the physics
blend<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:34.020> play<00:01:34.200> around<00:01:34.290> with<00:01:34.439> this<00:01:34.530> so

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
blend and and play around with this so

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.770 
blend and and play around with this so
if<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.920> set<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.579> zero<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:36.479> means<00:01:36.630> that

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
if I set this to zero it means that

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.620 
if I set this to zero it means that
everything<00:01:37.200> is<00:01:37.290> going<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.470> be<00:01:37.640> animated<00:01:38.640> if<00:01:39.540> I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
everything is going to be animated if I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.870 
everything is going to be animated if I
set<00:01:39.780> it<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.960> 1<00:01:40.170> then<00:01:41.009> anything<00:01:41.310> that<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.700> be

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
set it to 1 then anything that can be

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.780 
set it to 1 then anything that can be
simulated<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.899> understand<00:01:43.500> simulated<00:01:43.950> 0.5

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
simulated is understand simulated 0.5

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.210 
simulated is understand simulated 0.5
will<00:01:45.360> do<00:01:45.659> like<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.960> blend<00:01:46.380> between<00:01:46.530> two<00:01:46.860> might

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
will do like a blend between two might

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.899 
will do like a blend between two might
be<00:01:47.329> bit<00:01:48.350> hard<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> see<00:01:49.619> but<00:01:49.649> anyway<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.790> might

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
be bit hard to see but anyway you might

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.670 
be bit hard to see but anyway you might
have<00:01:51.000> seen<00:01:51.149> some<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> this<00:01:51.689> in<00:01:51.990> our<00:01:52.259> content

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
have seen some of this in our content

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.069 
have seen some of this in our content
examples<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.220> you<00:01:53.700> can<00:01:53.880> you<00:01:54.540> can<00:01:54.570> edit<00:01:54.930> all

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
examples and you can you can edit all

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.300 
examples and you can you can edit all
this<00:01:55.200> through<00:01:55.439> blueprint<00:01:55.799> but<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.159> want

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
this through blueprint but I just want

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.090 
this through blueprint but I just want
to<00:01:56.430> show<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:57.110> one<00:01:58.110> last<00:01:58.320> thing<00:01:58.740> that<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.920> want

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
to show you one last thing that I want

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.600 
to show you one last thing that I want
to<00:01:59.159> show<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.670> is<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.659> bit<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.350> more<00:02:02.219> advanced

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
to show you is a bit of a more advanced

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.700 
to show you is a bit of a more advanced
feature<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.329> constraints<00:02:03.869> so

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710 
feature in the constraints so

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.990 
feature in the constraints so
if<00:02:06.100> you<00:02:06.250> go<00:02:06.370> to<00:02:07.080> constraints<00:02:08.080> and<00:02:08.759> look<00:02:09.759> at<00:02:09.910> the

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
if you go to constraints and look at the

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.750 
if you go to constraints and look at the
head<00:02:10.179> I'm<00:02:10.960> actually<00:02:11.050> going<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.350> change<00:02:12.100> this

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:12.760 
head I'm actually going to change this

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.690 
head I'm actually going to change this
back<00:02:13.210> to<00:02:13.650> lock<00:02:14.650> so<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.040> we<00:02:15.130> only<00:02:15.160> have<00:02:15.520> this

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
back to lock so that we only have this

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.880 
back to lock so that we only have this
one<00:02:15.760> axis<00:02:17.100> so<00:02:18.100> if<00:02:18.370> we<00:02:19.140> do<00:02:20.140> select<00:02:20.470> a<00:02:20.530> simulation

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
one axis so if we do select a simulation

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.820 
one axis so if we do select a simulation
and<00:02:21.190> no<00:02:22.030> Grevy<00:02:22.360> we<00:02:23.050> can<00:02:23.200> move<00:02:23.350> the<00:02:23.470> head<00:02:23.560> around

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
and no Grevy we can move the head around

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.650 
and no Grevy we can move the head around
right<00:02:24.040> and<00:02:24.330> that's<00:02:25.330> fine

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
right and that's fine

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.380 
right and that's fine
but<00:02:26.230> sometimes<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.940> might<00:02:28.090> want<00:02:28.300> to

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
but sometimes you you might want to

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.780 
but sometimes you you might want to
actually<00:02:28.660> have<00:02:29.470> a<00:02:29.500> bit<00:02:29.800> more<00:02:29.980> of<00:02:30.070> a<00:02:30.100> springy

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
actually have a bit more of a springy

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.730 
actually have a bit more of a springy
feeling<00:02:31.360> so<00:02:32.110> to<00:02:32.800> do<00:02:33.670> that<00:02:34.290> you<00:02:35.290> can<00:02:35.440> look<00:02:35.470> at

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
feeling so to do that you can look at

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.690 
feeling so to do that you can look at
the<00:02:37.680> advanced<00:02:38.680> option<00:02:39.130> here<00:02:39.280> in<00:02:39.370> angular

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:39.700 
the advanced option here in angular

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.300 
the advanced option here in angular
limits<00:02:40.030> so<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:41.200> can<00:02:41.290> see<00:02:41.380> we're<00:02:41.530> using<00:02:41.680> swing

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
limits so you can see we're using swing

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.760 
limits so you can see we're using swing
limits<00:02:42.640> soft<00:02:42.880> and<00:02:43.320> the<00:02:44.320> way<00:02:44.410> this<00:02:44.500> works<00:02:44.680> is

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
limits soft and the way this works is

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.710 
limits soft and the way this works is
that<00:02:44.830> it's<00:02:45.070> basically<00:02:45.310> it<00:02:45.610> is<00:02:46.060> just<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.300> spring

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
that it's basically it is just a spring

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.740 
that it's basically it is just a spring
mechanism<00:02:47.320> that's<00:02:47.890> keeping<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.340> body<00:02:48.750> back

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
mechanism that's keeping the body back

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.990 
mechanism that's keeping the body back
inside<00:02:50.320> this<00:02:50.620> this<00:02:51.250> constraint<00:02:51.700> so<00:02:51.790> as<00:02:51.880> soon

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
inside this this constraint so as soon

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.870 
inside this this constraint so as soon
as<00:02:52.150> the<00:02:52.360> yellow<00:02:52.840> line<00:02:53.350> gets<00:02:54.310> outside<00:02:54.520> of<00:02:54.790> here

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
as the yellow line gets outside of here

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.420 
as the yellow line gets outside of here
a<00:02:55.630> spring<00:02:56.230> with<00:02:56.410> these<00:02:56.560> values<00:02:56.950> is<00:02:57.160> what

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
a spring with these values is what

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:01.160 
a spring with these values is what
pushes<00:02:57.640> it<00:02:57.820> back<00:02:57.850> in<00:02:58.120> so<00:02:58.600> if<00:02:58.959> I<00:02:59.290> if<00:03:00.070> I<00:03:00.220> make<00:03:00.370> this

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
pushes it back in so if I if I make this

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:06.000 
pushes it back in so if I if I make this
100<00:03:02.170> and<00:03:02.620> I<00:03:03.250> turn<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.120> damping<00:03:04.600> down<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:05.170> lot

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
100 and I turn the damping down a lot

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.220 
100 and I turn the damping down a lot
then<00:03:07.000> it'll<00:03:07.690> be<00:03:07.780> more<00:03:07.900> obvious

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
then it'll be more obvious

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.660 
then it'll be more obvious
we're<00:03:08.709> playing<00:03:08.890> with<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.190> actually<00:03:09.280> let<00:03:09.610> me

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
we're playing with and actually let me

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.410 
we're playing with and actually let me
just<00:03:09.850> turn<00:03:10.000> this<00:03:10.060> on<00:03:10.959> so<00:03:11.680> you<00:03:11.830> can<00:03:11.950> see<00:03:12.330> so<00:03:13.330> you

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
just turn this on so you can see so you

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.250 
just turn this on so you can see so you
can<00:03:13.570> see<00:03:13.720> now<00:03:13.959> as<00:03:14.320> I<00:03:15.010> move<00:03:15.850> this<00:03:16.090> way<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.900> head

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
can see now as I move this way the head

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.410 
can see now as I move this way the head
actually<00:03:17.500> bounces<00:03:18.100> back<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.640> you<00:03:19.209> might<00:03:19.330> be

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
actually bounces back and you might be

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.180 
actually bounces back and you might be
wondering<00:03:19.570> like<00:03:19.959> why<00:03:20.140> would<00:03:20.320> you<00:03:20.470> want<00:03:21.070> this

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
wondering like why would you want this

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.160 
wondering like why would you want this
effect<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:22.480> it<00:03:22.630> doesn't<00:03:22.870> really<00:03:22.959> make<00:03:23.140> sense

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
effect and it doesn't really make sense

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.430 
effect and it doesn't really make sense
you<00:03:23.500> know<00:03:23.620> for<00:03:23.890> for<00:03:24.370> a<00:03:24.400> character<00:03:24.670> but<00:03:25.440> for

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
you know for for a character but for

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.240 
you know for for a character but for
example<00:03:26.530> in<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:27.040> upcoming<00:03:27.640> vehicle<00:03:29.250> sample

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
example in the upcoming vehicle sample

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.190 
example in the upcoming vehicle sample
game<00:03:30.400> we<00:03:30.850> actually<00:03:31.120> have<00:03:31.239> a<00:03:31.269> little<00:03:31.720> antenna

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
game we actually have a little antenna

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.900 
game we actually have a little antenna
on<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.709> car<00:03:32.890> and<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.160> way<00:03:33.250> that's<00:03:33.400> set<00:03:33.580> up<00:03:33.610> is

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:33.910 
on the car and the way that's set up is

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.530 
on the car and the way that's set up is
is<00:03:34.120> just<00:03:34.690> using<00:03:34.930> a<00:03:35.140> bone<00:03:35.380> and<00:03:36.360> kind<00:03:37.360> of<00:03:37.390> like<00:03:37.510> a

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:37.540 
is just using a bone and kind of like a

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.610 
is just using a bone and kind of like a
spring<00:03:38.070> spring<00:03:39.120> constraint<00:03:40.120> so<00:03:40.750> that's

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 
spring spring constraint so that's

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.240 
spring spring constraint so that's
pretty<00:03:41.769> much<00:03:41.860> it<00:03:42.040> I<00:03:42.160> think<00:03:42.370> this<00:03:42.850> wraps<00:03:43.180> up<00:03:43.420> the

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
pretty much it I think this wraps up the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.280 
pretty much it I think this wraps up the
entire<00:03:45.250> series<00:03:45.580> on<00:03:45.610> fat<00:03:46.060> if<00:03:46.870> there's<00:03:47.080> anything

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
entire series on fat if there's anything

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.020 
entire series on fat if there's anything
that<00:03:47.440> I've<00:03:47.680> missed<00:03:47.890> please<00:03:48.430> let<00:03:48.610> me<00:03:48.670> know<00:03:48.790> I'm

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
that I've missed please let me know I'm

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.750 
that I've missed please let me know I'm
more<00:03:49.390> than<00:03:49.540> happy<00:03:49.690> to<00:03:49.780> answer<00:03:49.989> any<00:03:50.380> questions

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
more than happy to answer any questions

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.230 
more than happy to answer any questions
