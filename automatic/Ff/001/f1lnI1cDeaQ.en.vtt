00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
game you keep it on the high ground

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.090 
game you keep it on the high ground
taking<00:02:01.450> a<00:02:01.630> small<00:02:02.110> risk<00:02:02.470> here<00:02:02.710> and<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:02.920> same

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
taking a small risk here and the same

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.180 
taking a small risk here and the same
zealot<00:02:03.460> pressure<00:02:03.670> will<00:02:03.850> come<00:02:04.030> out<00:02:04.120> for<00:02:04.300> tails

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
zealot pressure will come out for tails

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.290 
zealot pressure will come out for tails
however<00:02:06.190> he<00:02:06.340> is<00:02:06.430> scouting<00:02:06.670> the<00:02:06.880> incorrect

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
however he is scouting the incorrect

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.820 
however he is scouting the incorrect
direction<00:02:07.750> with<00:02:07.900> that<00:02:08.080> cell<00:02:08.290> is<00:02:08.410> so<00:02:08.680> it's

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
direction with that cell is so it's

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.580 
direction with that cell is so it's
awfully<00:02:09.160> very<00:02:09.369> useful<00:02:09.729> for<00:02:09.760> him<00:02:10.380> yeah<00:02:11.380> both<00:02:11.410> of

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
awfully very useful for him yeah both of

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:12.780 
awfully very useful for him yeah both of
them<00:02:11.830> of<00:02:11.950> course<00:02:11.980> scouting<00:02:12.520> the<00:02:12.610> closed

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
them of course scouting the closed

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.670 
them of course scouting the closed
position<00:02:13.030> first<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:13.840> then<00:02:13.960> heading<00:02:14.320> towards

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
position first and then heading towards

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.980 
position first and then heading towards
the<00:02:14.890> cross<00:02:15.370> so<00:02:16.180> both<00:02:16.330> i'm<00:02:16.510> having<00:02:16.780> a<00:02:16.870> little

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
the cross so both i'm having a little

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:19.380 
the cross so both i'm having a little
bit<00:02:17.170> more<00:02:17.470> time<00:02:17.740> and<00:02:18.010> this<00:02:18.370> also<00:02:18.580> allows<00:02:18.910> poll

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
bit more time and this also allows poll

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.910 
bit more time and this also allows poll
to<00:02:19.540> get<00:02:19.690> those<00:02:19.900> Marines<00:02:20.290> out<00:02:20.560> so<00:02:20.740> that<00:02:20.890> they

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
to get those Marines out so that they

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.250 
to get those Marines out so that they
can<00:02:21.190> actually<00:02:21.430> deny<00:02:21.850> scouting<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.960> which<00:02:23.110> is

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:23.260 
can actually deny scouting and which is

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.810 
can actually deny scouting and which is
pretty<00:02:23.440> cool<00:02:23.680> i<00:02:23.920> mean<00:02:24.220> if<00:02:24.370> you're<00:02:24.490> a<00:02:24.520> Terran

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
pretty cool i mean if you're a Terran

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.580 
pretty cool i mean if you're a Terran
player<00:02:24.970> this<00:02:25.390> is<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:25.570> pretty<00:02:25.780> control<00:02:26.170> position

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
player this is a pretty control position

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:27.810 
player this is a pretty control position
because<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:27.100> know<00:02:27.280> that<00:02:27.490> your<00:02:27.610> opponent

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
because you know that your opponent

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.850 
because you know that your opponent
doesn't<00:02:28.150> have<00:02:28.330> any<00:02:28.570> scouting<00:02:29.200> information<00:02:29.740> at

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
doesn't have any scouting information at

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.800 
doesn't have any scouting information at
all<00:02:29.890> and<00:02:30.310> the<00:02:30.610> proto<00:02:30.820> space<00:02:31.120> EG<00:02:31.300> has<00:02:31.510> to<00:02:31.630> play

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
all and the proto space EG has to play

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:36.750 
all and the proto space EG has to play
blind<00:02:32.190> this<00:02:33.190> was<00:02:33.400> true<00:02:33.820> uh<00:02:35.280> I'm<00:02:36.280> wondering

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
blind this was true uh I'm wondering

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.750 
blind this was true uh I'm wondering
what<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:38.410> follow-up<00:02:38.920> is<00:02:39.130> going<00:02:39.490> to<00:02:39.550> be<00:02:39.610> the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
what the follow-up is going to be the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.700 
what the follow-up is going to be the
sign<00:02:39.970> because<00:02:40.210> tails<00:02:40.480> last<00:02:40.840> game<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.410> know<00:02:41.530> he

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:41.710 
sign because tails last game you know he

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.770 
sign because tails last game you know he
went<00:02:41.860> for<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.220> faster<00:02:42.790> robo<00:02:43.150> because<00:02:43.540> he<00:02:43.660> was

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
went for the faster robo because he was

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.710 
went for the faster robo because he was
like<00:02:43.870> well<00:02:44.080> pull<00:02:45.040> tightened<00:02:45.430> out<00:02:45.520> here<00:02:45.820> if<00:02:46.390> he

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
like well pull tightened out here if he

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.990 
like well pull tightened out here if he
on<00:02:47.290> this<00:02:47.560> map<00:02:47.770> I<00:02:47.920> don't<00:02:48.100> think<00:02:48.160> he<00:02:48.490> is<00:02:48.820> actually

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
on this map I don't think he is actually

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.670 
on this map I don't think he is actually
going<00:02:49.270> to<00:02:49.360> be<00:02:49.420> able<00:02:49.570> to<00:02:49.870> break<00:02:50.230> up<00:02:50.410> the<00:02:50.500> ramp

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
going to be able to break up the ramp

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.050 
going to be able to break up the ramp
with<00:02:50.830> the<00:02:51.010> bunker<00:02:51.490> there<00:02:51.610> is<00:02:51.730> an<00:02:51.820> app<00:02:51.910> to

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.060 
with the bunker there is an app to

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.580 
with the bunker there is an app to
sacrifice<00:02:52.510> one<00:02:52.690> of<00:02:52.780> his<00:02:52.900> else<00:02:53.080> if<00:02:53.230> he<00:02:53.320> wants<00:02:53.530> to

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
sacrifice one of his else if he wants to

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.200 
sacrifice one of his else if he wants to
do<00:02:53.740> the<00:02:53.830> night<00:02:53.950> well<00:02:54.610> we'll<00:02:54.850> see<00:02:55.000> what<00:02:55.150> he

definitely lose this game to a for gate
this<00:03:27.070> happens<00:03:27.459> quite<00:03:27.670> often<00:03:28.239> actually<00:03:28.570> it's

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
this happens quite often actually it's
