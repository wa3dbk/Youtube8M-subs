00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:14.269
 the choice of the right airsoft weapon 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.710
 this video is a little guide 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.600
 especially for beginners by us 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.380
 show how you get your right he soft 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.390
 weapon of looking first ask you 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.820
 to face this is how old 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.980
 I am you are under 18 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.529
 but over 14 so only come up 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.239
 weapons to 0 5 joule for you in question 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.219
 are you over 18 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.390
 So soft weapons come up for you 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:41.850
 75 debt issue 750 are the 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.530
 legal limit only eight weapons from 0 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.920
 5 joules are not allowed anymore 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.899
 be fully automatic next 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.390
 should you make sure where you are 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.579
 Do you play in tight buildings 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.110
 are sniper rifles and weapons 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.760
 not really with a very long run 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.699
 appropriate or useful 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.739
 do you play on big surfaces with big ones 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:04.860
 Distances are machine pistol like 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.960
 for example, the hkm p7 rather inappropriate because 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.210
 For example, this one for large 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.409
 distance too short a run and 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.400
 thus rather for shorter distances 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.689
 are suitable 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.909
 Let's summarize again 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.590
 do you play in the narrower buildings 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.080
 or watchman angulate 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.570
 surfaces we recommend shorter ones 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.200
 airsoft weapons like for example 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.869
 submachine guns and smaller ones 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.549
 storm rifles you play on a large scale 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.860
 landscaped grounds we recommend the 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.750
 first weapons with longer running speak 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.659
 more precision like storm rifles and 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.820
 sniper rifles as a branch weapon 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.860
 also called secondary it is recommended 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.240
 a rather soft weapon to use the 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.250
 you can pull very fast 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.110
 be it a pistol or a revolver 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.180
 a small submachine gun or 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.460
 maybe a grenade launcher also player 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.350
 Over 18 years we recommend if one 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.740
 submachine gun chosen as two weapon 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.509
 will choose 1 0 5 joule model one 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.520
 we recommend grenade launcher in consideration 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.350
 in front of other players only outdoor 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.000
 use 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.950
 have you now for an energy class 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.380
 and a primary weapon type decided 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.780
 ie assault rifle submachine gun or 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.489
 sniper rifle, it is now with the 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.620
 Type of drive of your primary weapon 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:14.870
 continue 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.360
 basically there are first meetings with 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.330
 following types of drive automatic 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.459
 electric very briefly eeg own it one 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.200
 Battery operated electric motor of the over 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.780
 a gear with a pen 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.090
 Pistons exciting with each press of the 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.860
 The engine tensions in the first one 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.870
 phase the errors in the second phase 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.849
 the error is released and works 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.769
 on a piston is the air 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.549
 compresses the compressed air accelerates 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:39.680
 the ammunition 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.329
 This type of drive is mainly used in 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.010
 assault guns and machine guns 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.819
 fully automatic pistols used 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.890
 Both will be a battery and charger 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:50.420
 needed at low temperatures against 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.849
 they are usually only very good at zero degrees 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.069
 Limited operational spring pressure 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.739
 rather soft weapons also springboard whole 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.629
 kurz springs use the energy of 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:01.909
 a previously hand tightened screws 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.599
 error about the ammunition from the barrel too 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.790
 accelerate 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.220
 So you have to after every shot 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.720
 loading this type of drive will be especially 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:11.060
 at sniper rifles and looks 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.700
 quite used pen pressure rather soft 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:15.379
 Weapons are temperature independent 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.660
 but as I said after every shot again 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.190
 Loading 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.290
 that he often weapons accelerate the 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.150
 Ammunition by means of propellant such as 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.419
 for example, propane gas or co2 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:28.069
 one distinguishes between 

00:03:25.419 --> 00:03:30.590
 gas-powered first weapons with or 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.540
 without playback function gas-powered 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.590
 first often weapons with globex called 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.879
 one as a guest Globex often weapons short gwb 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.579
 gas powered airsoft weapons without 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.620
 playback as nbb or non beck the 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.239
 globex function causes that to become 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.639
 Example of the sled of a pistol 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.500
 each shot moves back and forth nbbl 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:50.569
 software from consume less 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.690
 Most of these gases are produced by means of co2 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:54.970
 operated this type of drive with gas will 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.470
 especially with storm rifles 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.720
 machine gun pistols but also 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.180
 Sniper rifles uses co2 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.949
 he operated soft at four degrees 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:06.590
 a double to the low pressure as with 

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:07.190
 30 degrees at propane gas operated 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.379
 the same 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:10.730
 it is therefore recommended for higher 

00:04:09.379 --> 00:04:12.500
 temperatures to play 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.389
 the gas is mostly in magazine 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:17.359
 so you always have to fill one 

00:04:14.389 --> 00:04:19.910
 have gas bottle or co2 cartridge with you 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:22.909
 Almost all gas-powered first weapons 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.810
 have more than 0 5 joules are from 18 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:26.639
 released years 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.860
 let's put it together again you have the 

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.780
 energy classes selected eighth here 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.270
 how much school the playing field to 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.770
 play allowed you have covered 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.780
 how long your first weapon is about 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.639
 should be based on the playing field where 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:40.440
 you're gonna play as well 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.180
 what kind of weapon to set 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.860
 want to use and how about the 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.750
 drive of the same 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:47.820
 now had to be based on the selected 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.630
 procure a game type as criteria 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.520
 align 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:53.190
 with more soft, there are basically two 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.530
 game types air soft sniper and 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.270
 regular air soft games as he soft 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.669
 Sniper is the gun and the 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.290
 tatkleidung priorisiert because one as 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.300
 First Sagittarius usually not much 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.360
 equipment and quite a few magazines 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.520
 leads you know now approximately in which 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.110
 Direction your game type goes with and 

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:12.510
 which primary and secondary weapon you are 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.280
 if you want to play in a first of 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.080
 pop a weapon spotted you 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.030
 you should like before buying 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:19.950
 First, the criteria throughout the 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:22.290
 you hate established by this video 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:24.150
 are all fulfilled it goes into detail 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.889
 what opportunities does this only 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:27.660
 weapon if you continue the weapon 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.910
 want to personalize and customize 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.950
 So you should ask yourself that is 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.870
 Mechanically convertible and compatible too 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.850
 many manufacturers, the weapon is light 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.470
 open to repair it has 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.720
 the weapon device for another 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.910
 Equipment as target helps front handles 

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:43.890
 and to attach cameras is the weapon in the 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.320
 General compatible with accessories 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:48.000
 manufacturers of which we have some products 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:51.000
 fallen the duh wants to block 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.919
 to belong like magazine euro pubs gas batteries 

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.570
 feathers and so on are available 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:56.160
 magazine bags the the magazines 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:58.979
 soft water can absorb 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.360
 beware the mechanics of the weapon may only 

00:05:58.979 --> 00:06:02.070
 to change a gunsmith 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.690
 anything not in the mechanics 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:06.510
 you are allowed to intervene 

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.700
 if your potential he soft weapon all 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.919
 meets these personalized criteria 

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.289
 before you finally order them 

00:06:10.919 --> 00:06:15.570
 in the internet after test reports resp 

00:06:13.289 --> 00:06:17.520
 You can find reviews on our channel 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:19.020
 reviews of many rather soft weapons 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.780
 maybe there are a few here for you 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.900
 while didier at his purchase decision 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.180
 help

 We would be happy if you like your greed 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.530
 you can find it properly in this

 here video linked like your good 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:32.190
 he soft rocket we build 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.349
 you find in this video by rapper 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:36.210
 we hope that you have yours for you 

00:06:34.349 --> 00:06:37.090
 Perfect he soft weapon with the help of this 

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.980
 instructions from 

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:40.870
 We have found in the 

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:42.400
 comments for which you know yourself 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:44.830
 decided and why 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.780
 if you're new to soft sport look 

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.770
 you necessarily our first basic 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.680
 safety video on 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:52.630
 to do everything right around us right away 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.910
 We would like to support ourselves through one

 Visit our website very happy 

00:06:56.979 --> 00:07:01.860
 Thank you for watching a lot of fun 

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.860
 play at first
