guess<00:02:51.180> but<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.780> Clone<00:02:52.990> Wars<00:02:53.110> isn't<00:02:53.410> allowed

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
guess but the Clone Wars isn't allowed

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.680 
guess but the Clone Wars isn't allowed
little<00:02:54.310> kids<00:02:54.550> that<00:02:54.760> didn't<00:02:55.030> actually<00:02:55.090> grow<00:02:55.630> up

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
little kids that didn't actually grow up

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.880 
little kids that didn't actually grow up
with<00:02:55.810> Star<00:02:56.020> Wars<00:02:56.050> to<00:02:56.320> not<00:02:56.470> be<00:02:56.590> able<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.800> get

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
with Star Wars to not be able to get

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.760 
with Star Wars to not be able to get
part<00:02:57.160> of<00:02:57.280> the<00:02:57.430> whole<00:02:57.580> series<00:02:58.000> and<00:02:58.560> get<00:02:59.560> into

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
part of the whole series and get into

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.290 
part of the whole series and get into
the<00:02:59.860> galaxy<00:03:00.070> of<00:03:00.310> their<00:03:00.490> own<00:03:00.640> which<00:03:00.940> is<00:03:01.120> still

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
the galaxy of their own which is still

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.200 
the galaxy of their own which is still

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
Star Wars so I think the clone was

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.630 
Star Wars so I think the clone was
