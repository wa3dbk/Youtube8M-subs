was conceived in 1933 and was published
in<00:02:02.270> I<00:02:02.600> think<00:02:03.039> 1937<00:02:04.060> so<00:02:05.060> that's<00:02:05.389> a<00:02:05.569> kind<00:02:05.840> of<00:02:05.929> a

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
in I think 1937 so that's a kind of a

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.230 
in I think 1937 so that's a kind of a
nice<00:02:06.170> little<00:02:06.469> reference<00:02:07.249> right<00:02:07.609> there<00:02:07.850> but<00:02:08.119> he

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
nice little reference right there but he

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.820 
nice little reference right there but he
is<00:02:08.450> called<00:02:08.720> Icarus<00:02:09.110> he<00:02:09.229> has<00:02:09.350> a<00:02:09.380> son<00:02:09.619> on<00:02:09.800> his

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:09.830 
is called Icarus he has a son on his

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.280 
is called Icarus he has a son on his
chest<00:02:10.220> he<00:02:10.429> can<00:02:10.580> fly<00:02:10.880> he<00:02:11.240> might<00:02:11.720> not<00:02:11.840> have<00:02:11.900> wings

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
chest he can fly he might not have wings

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.750 
chest he can fly he might not have wings
you<00:02:12.500> would<00:02:12.590> assume<00:02:12.860> that<00:02:13.100> if<00:02:13.250> he<00:02:13.459> is<00:02:13.490> a

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
you would assume that if he is a

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.980 
you would assume that if he is a
character<00:02:14.090> called<00:02:14.360> Icarus<00:02:14.750> II<00:02:14.810> would<00:02:14.959> have

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:14.990 
character called Icarus II would have

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.199 
character called Icarus II would have
wings<00:02:15.470> because<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:15.980> how<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.730> myth<00:02:17.030> and

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
wings because that is how the myth and

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.720 
wings because that is how the myth and
story<00:02:17.480> goes<00:02:17.840> but<00:02:18.319> the<00:02:19.280> character<00:02:19.640> the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
story goes but the character the

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.670 
story goes but the character the
superhero<00:02:20.090> character<00:02:20.450> is<00:02:20.629> called

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
superhero character is called

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.190 
superhero character is called
rest<00:02:21.890> and<00:02:22.129> we<00:02:22.280> have<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:22.780> proven<00:02:23.780> with<00:02:23.930> proof

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
rest and we have that proven with proof

happens at the end of that when you

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.800 
happens at the end of that when you
break<00:03:34.280> the<00:03:34.489> cycle<00:03:34.849> instead<00:03:35.060> of<00:03:35.180> continuing<00:03:35.690> it

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
break the cycle instead of continuing it

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.839 
break the cycle instead of continuing it
what<00:03:36.260> happens<00:03:36.590> is<00:03:36.769> all<00:03:37.069> four<00:03:37.370> characters<00:03:37.729> will

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
what happens is all four characters will

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.460 
what happens is all four characters will
go<00:03:37.939> to<00:03:38.000> the<00:03:38.180> Golden<00:03:38.479> Gate<00:03:38.599> Bridge<00:03:38.659> and<00:03:39.109> then

go to the Golden Gate Bridge and then

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.439 
go to the Golden Gate Bridge and then
they<00:03:39.650> will<00:03:39.739> have<00:03:39.889> the<00:03:40.040> option<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.579> either<00:03:41.120> kill

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:41.449 
they will have the option to either kill

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.420 
they will have the option to either kill
weasel<00:03:41.900> or<00:03:42.049> not<00:03:42.379> kill<00:03:42.620> weasel<00:03:43.010> and<00:03:43.220> if<00:03:43.370> you
