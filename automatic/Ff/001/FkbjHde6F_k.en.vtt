00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:04.730
 i 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.350
 what for some may seem like a 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.280
 dirty work for the family tapia is 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.950
 give life to the earth 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.530
 our parents and that taught us and 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.500
 we continue because because also from there 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:28.220
 we stay because we do not have this 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.560
 profession then we of our 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.500
 work as pottery we dedicate ourselves 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:36.350
 We are going to sell them to fairs at a fair 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.390
 or simply to the market so 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.059
 get dirty with the mud or what is it 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.160
 same with earth or clay becomes 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.650
 in a trade that makes a lot of sense 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.010
 even when the new generations are 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.260
 resist it yes they do not want well 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.629
 well they do not want but I do say they have 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:57.409
 have to learn it because there are many 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:59.900
 then they say no and I did not vote for 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:02.510
 mexico there are not many jobs that the 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.820
 rate if not I'm going to me I do not like 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.790
 do it because it is very dirty because it is 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:10.940
 that we ended up here late because it's that 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.020
 I never get a job but it's nice this 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.020
 work is nice 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.180
 in the skirts of popocatÃ©petl it 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.060
 find the town to be frames 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.850
 acteopan the heart of the mud located in 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.950
 the state of puebla at 120 km from its 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.590
 capital the isolation to which he has been 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.140
 submitted largely explains its iron 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:43.750
 pottery vocation I am now the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:48.000
 most valued for 11 pesos 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:51.780
 to 11 pesos and that finished molcajete 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.990
 It's worth 18 pesos 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.940
 baked if you wanted as are customers that 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:02:02.560
 we have then we do not give them a price 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.490
 very high because they too 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.490
 you have to implement 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.520
 do not 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.530
 Well, these are going to make some molcajetes 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:22.590
 who asked us how to do the house 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:25.980
 it's hard to say an omelette to put it 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.709
 that the mold works if we do not use here 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.340
 lathe in this not your jump is not pure 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.620
 this freehand 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.420
 after removing the pieces for a day 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.610
 whole dust is removed and 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.000
 placed in the adobe oven whose shape 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.209
 It is similar to a water well 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.319
 free baked this fills up 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:50.430
 lid and are the mouths to put the 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.430
 firewood and even the girl 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.970
 we use the cotton swab to put the 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.970
 credits 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:03.450
 the generosity of the mud makes it 

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.450
 moldable almost by all 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.960
 if not
