00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.469 
so as you could see pretty much on this
side<00:02:06.010> it's<00:02:06.310> stationary<00:02:06.760> now<00:02:07.360> so

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
side it's stationary now so

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.470 
side it's stationary now so
and<00:02:10.479> I<00:02:10.569> couldn't<00:02:10.959> mine<00:02:11.140> this<00:02:11.470> out<00:02:11.770> and<00:02:12.280> if<00:02:13.150> you

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
and I couldn't mine this out and if you

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.530 
and I couldn't mine this out and if you
get<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.720> hole<00:02:14.700> where's<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.850> hole<00:02:16.030> okay<00:02:16.390> right

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
get a hole where's the hole okay right

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.600 
get a hole where's the hole okay right
here<00:02:16.720> if<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.440> get<00:02:17.560> a<00:02:17.620> hole<00:02:17.890> and<00:02:18.130> hold<00:02:18.430> that

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
here if you get a hole and hold that

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.030 
here if you get a hole and hold that
spam<00:02:19.300> it<00:02:19.630> starts<00:02:19.870> flowing<00:02:20.080> Blanco<00:02:20.650> State

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
spam it starts flowing Blanco State

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.160 
spam it starts flowing Blanco State
there<00:02:21.160> you<00:02:21.220> go<00:02:21.340> redstone<00:02:21.819> alternatives<00:02:22.450> so

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
there you go redstone alternatives so

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.590 
there you go redstone alternatives so
that's<00:02:24.130> how<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.430> works

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.750 

let<00:02:28.600> me<00:02:28.690> just<00:02:28.870> patch<00:02:29.110> this<00:02:29.380> up<00:02:29.650> before<00:02:30.100> I<00:02:30.130> show

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
let me just patch this up before I show

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.410 
let me just patch this up before I show
you<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.720> again<00:02:32.310> I'm<00:02:33.310> just<00:02:33.459> gonna<00:02:33.610> show<00:02:33.910> you<00:02:33.970> now

you so again I'm just gonna show you now
it's<00:02:34.660> a<00:02:34.750> little<00:02:35.230> color-coded<00:02:36.040> on<00:02:36.540> I'm<00:02:37.540> just

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
it's a little color-coded on I'm just

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.140 
it's a little color-coded on I'm just
gonna<00:02:37.930> put<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.320> water<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:39.370> water<00:02:39.550> bucket

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
gonna put the water on the water bucket

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.050 
gonna put the water on the water bucket
right<00:02:40.330> there<00:02:40.630> on<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.320> red<00:02:41.530> block<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.340> then

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
right there on the red block and then

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.199 
right there on the red block and then
I'm<00:02:43.180> gonna<00:02:43.360> punch<00:02:43.690> out<00:02:43.930> these<00:02:44.110> blue<00:02:44.380> blocks<00:02:45.209> so

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
I'm gonna punch out these blue blocks so

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.120 
I'm gonna punch out these blue blocks so
just<00:02:46.600> do<00:02:46.780> that

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.780 

and<00:02:52.130> then<00:02:52.460> you<00:02:52.820> could<00:02:53.120> cover<00:02:53.630> this<00:02:53.930> up<00:02:54.230> and

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
and then you could cover this up and

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.360 
and then you could cover this up and
then<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:56.210> can<00:02:56.480> add<00:02:57.380> your<00:02:57.440> little<00:02:58.010> redstone

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
then you can add your little redstone

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.250 
then you can add your little redstone
alternatives<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.600> the<00:02:59.750> other<00:02:59.900> side<00:03:00.230> so<00:03:01.190> um

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
alternatives to the other side so um

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.490 
alternatives to the other side so um
let's<00:03:03.260> just<00:03:04.060> if<00:03:05.060> you<00:03:05.300> up<00:03:05.540> it<00:03:05.990> just<00:03:06.290> updates

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
let's just if you up it just updates

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.310 
let's just if you up it just updates
it's<00:03:07.070> really<00:03:07.580> cool<00:03:07.820> guys<00:03:08.000> got<00:03:08.720> to<00:03:08.840> use<00:03:08.990> it

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
it's really cool guys got to use it

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.670 
it's really cool guys got to use it
daddy<00:03:09.800> use<00:03:10.070> it<00:03:10.280> um<00:03:11.050> but<00:03:12.050> just<00:03:12.260> to<00:03:12.410> prove<00:03:12.560> that

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
daddy use it um but just to prove that

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.250 
daddy use it um but just to prove that
it<00:03:12.890> works<00:03:13.190> with<00:03:13.430> lava<00:03:13.730> -<00:03:14.120> I<00:03:14.450> will<00:03:14.960> show<00:03:15.200> you

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
it works with lava - I will show you

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.100 
it works with lava - I will show you
it's<00:03:15.710> a<00:03:15.860> little<00:03:16.130> bit<00:03:16.250> harder<00:03:16.670> since<00:03:17.630> they<00:03:17.840> flow

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.110 
it's a little bit harder since they flow

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:19.690 
it's a little bit harder since they flow
at<00:03:18.170> different<00:03:18.590> rates<00:03:18.770> so<00:03:18.980> sometimes<00:03:19.580> you

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
at different rates so sometimes you

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.140 
at different rates so sometimes you
could<00:03:19.910> mess<00:03:20.090> up<00:03:20.120> but<00:03:20.690> it<00:03:20.930> still<00:03:21.200> works

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
could mess up but it still works

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.640 
could mess up but it still works
so<00:03:23.500> just<00:03:24.850> remember<00:03:25.850> just<00:03:26.030> put<00:03:26.720> in<00:03:26.870> your<00:03:26.900> your

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
so just remember just put in your your

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.350 
so just remember just put in your your
source<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.370> then<00:03:28.760> punch<00:03:29.180> out<00:03:29.420> this<00:03:29.780> side<00:03:31.360> see

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
source and then punch out this side see

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.420 
source and then punch out this side see
sometimes<00:03:32.990> it<00:03:33.170> doesn't<00:03:33.320> work<00:03:33.500> with<00:03:33.770> lava<00:03:34.070> I

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
sometimes it doesn't work with lava I

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.950 
sometimes it doesn't work with lava I
don't<00:03:34.640> know<00:03:34.760> why<00:03:36.460> it's<00:03:37.460> kind<00:03:38.300> of<00:03:38.360> hard<00:03:38.600> let<00:03:38.870> me

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
don't know why it's kind of hard let me

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.450 
don't know why it's kind of hard let me
just<00:03:39.140> try<00:03:39.260> to<00:03:39.380> get<00:03:39.530> this<00:03:39.770> just<00:03:40.130> to<00:03:40.250> show<00:03:40.400> you

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 
just try to get this just to show you

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.170 
just try to get this just to show you
guys<00:03:40.640> that<00:03:40.700> it<00:03:40.970> really<00:03:41.240> does<00:03:41.420> work

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.500 

see<00:03:47.180> it's<00:03:47.959> working<00:03:48.379> now<00:03:49.150> you<00:03:50.150> could<00:03:50.330> just

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
see it's working now you could just

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.970 
see it's working now you could just
patch<00:03:50.720> this<00:03:50.959> up<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:53.080> whatever<00:03:54.080> connect<00:03:54.799> your

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
patch this up and whatever connect your

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:56.800 
patch this up and whatever connect your
redstone<00:03:55.159> alternative<00:03:55.970> to<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.330> other<00:03:56.480> side

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
redstone alternative to the other side

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.320 
redstone alternative to the other side
if<00:03:56.930> you<00:03:57.080> want<00:03:57.290> I<00:03:57.680> don't<00:03:58.430> know<00:03:58.549> just<00:03:58.970> do

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
if you want I don't know just do

if you want I don't know just do
whatever<00:03:59.540> you<00:03:59.959> do<00:04:00.140> with<00:04:00.319> stationary<00:04:00.590> water<00:04:01.190> or

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
whatever you do with stationary water or

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.570 
whatever you do with stationary water or
lava<00:04:01.610> and<00:04:02.299> then<00:04:02.780> if<00:04:02.989> you<00:04:03.170> hoe<00:04:03.590> it<00:04:03.799> then<00:04:04.370> you

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
lava and then if you hoe it then you

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.030 
lava and then if you hoe it then you
could<00:04:04.730> see<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.150> starts<00:04:05.510> flowing<00:04:05.860> just<00:04:06.860> had<00:04:07.010> a

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
could see it starts flowing just had a

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:14.039 
could see it starts flowing just had a
mini<00:04:07.670> lag<00:04:07.970> spike<00:04:08.360> right<00:04:08.540> there<00:04:08.750> it<00:04:08.900> wasn't<00:04:09.230> to

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.590
