00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello laurent the confusing chair 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.940
 workshops reels and combines 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.480
 today I'm going to show you how 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.179
 we prepare and install a can 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:17.640
 that's what a can looks like for 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.900
 the ramp and will place it on its axis 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.180
 of cans 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.269
 we will take our coils of yarn 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.710
 will put on his support 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:33.350
 we will put it in small drums 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.840
 provided for this purpose here we will lay the wire 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:40.200
 in the can through a hole 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.800
 provided for this purpose on the side we recover 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.050
 his son 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.379
 we push the kz2 hunt that goes 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.010
 switch on the engine and we will be able to 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.540
 press the pedal to fill its 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.560
 duckling 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:54.560
 the can are filled alone 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.450
 following the sewing we have to do 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.190
 always fills his younger sister 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:08.630
 we do not need to use high 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.659
 I know 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.829
 this is for example like this when we 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.799
 wants to fill the can is thoroughly a brake 

00:01:14.829 --> 00:01:20.990
 blocks the can in time and art 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:24.200
 is automatically like these a 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.869
 Once the can is filled we take it with 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.189
 the son on the left ie havas 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.439
 went in the opposite direction of 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:35.210
 clockwise or at the break 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:38.899
 in the cadet case like those 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.250
 one where it will rotate in the direction 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.200
 counterclockwise on 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.520
 see it well here 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:50.630
 the son will go into the slot at this 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.539
 place and come out in the throat that 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.099
 is there after threading the thread the 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.640
 reel explained in another video 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:59.929
 we will recover the film from the can 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.009
 to be able to close the hood we get 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:07.640
 bobbin thread with the left hand is 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:10.880
 shoot on it operates the eel as 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.549
 if we could you can see at 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.239
 inside that the wire the coil does the 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:19.549
 can bob ride and recovers the son 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:23.390
 of cans that we will come out in 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:26.290
 pulling on the big floppy wire between the 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:33.049
 crowbar and culture plate 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:34.910
