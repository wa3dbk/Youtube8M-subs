00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.450 
have a forsake and you're kind of
missing<00:02:20.050> out<00:02:20.170> on<00:02:20.200> any<00:02:20.650> racial<00:02:20.890> skills<00:02:21.280> from

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
missing out on any racial skills from

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:24.260 
missing out on any racial skills from
the<00:02:21.580> Horde<00:02:21.790> so<00:02:22.110> this<00:02:23.110> finally<00:02:23.620> gives<00:02:23.650> them

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
the Horde so this finally gives them

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.170 
the Horde so this finally gives them
competition<00:02:25.270> against<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.810> other<00:02:25.960> races<00:02:26.170> and

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
competition against the other races and

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.230 
competition against the other races and
hopefully<00:02:28.180> it<00:02:28.390> scales<00:02:28.720> with<00:02:28.840> unholy<00:02:29.320> mastery

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
hopefully it scales with unholy mastery

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.150 
hopefully it scales with unholy mastery
but<00:02:31.240> that's<00:02:31.930> all<00:02:32.080> for<00:02:32.110> now<00:02:32.290> I'll<00:02:32.800> see<00:02:33.010> you<00:02:33.100> next

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
but that's all for now I'll see you next

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.360 
but that's all for now I'll see you next
time<00:02:33.630> and<00:02:34.630> I<00:02:35.260> think<00:02:35.320> the<00:02:35.560> next<00:02:35.920> video<00:02:36.190> I'm

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
time and I think the next video I'm

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.280 
time and I think the next video I'm
going<00:02:36.580> after<00:02:36.820> I<00:02:38.520> have<00:02:39.520> no<00:02:39.760> clue<00:02:40.060> see<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.960> next

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
going after I have no clue see you next

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.480 
going after I have no clue see you next
time<00:02:41.470> anyway<00:02:41.980> though<00:02:42.480> yeah
