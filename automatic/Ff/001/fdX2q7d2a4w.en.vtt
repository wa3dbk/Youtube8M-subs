this<00:02:04.070> game<00:02:04.340> captures<00:02:04.969> so<00:02:05.420> well<00:02:05.659> it's<00:02:06.289> not<00:02:06.530> a

00:02:06.819 --> 00:02:06.829 
this game captures so well it's not a

00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:09.849

means<00:02:10.100> it's<00:02:11.090> fun<00:02:11.420> but<00:02:11.660> after<00:02:12.019> a<00:02:12.049> while<00:02:12.320> it

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
means it's fun but after a while it

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.340 
means it's fun but after a while it
tends<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.190> get<00:02:13.400> a<00:02:13.430> little<00:02:13.700> repetitive<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:15.200> not

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350

just<00:02:15.530> because<00:02:15.829> the<00:02:15.980> music<00:02:16.340> repeats<00:02:16.670> itself

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:28.759

is<00:03:27.030> an<00:03:27.120> excellent<00:03:27.420> version<00:03:27.720> so<00:03:28.349> I<00:03:28.379> think<00:03:28.500> it's

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
two-player mode but for the most part

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.840

it's<00:04:08.420> very<00:04:08.750> glitch<00:04:09.110> free<00:04:09.650> and<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.400> graphics
