00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.360
 he is quite critical of the fashion scene 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.350
 is not as easy as that 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.540
 introduces and it is still a job 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.530
 very lonely 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.750
 the rejection of course it everyday in 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:37.530
 you have to learn the profession with that 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.150
 deal 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:44.319
 on the other side makes a 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.329
 also stronger 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.700

 look at the iphones more time remains 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.249
 not even men's models need three 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.799
 hours before the show begins 

00:02:57.249 --> 00:03:01.840
 here in paris grand palais 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.389

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.349
 rehearsed for a top model w poll week 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.349
 that is part of everyday life 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.250
 always upright chest out with it 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.099
 just standing straight does not work 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.439
 how the shoulders hang 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:20.970
 confidence confident the belgian 

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:22.890

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.720
 German regularly his latest 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.150
 The collection is inspired by the ballet 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.860
 on the catwalk paul goes with week 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.890
 its striking look looks on 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.890
 yourself 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.400
 is for me an icon of his style 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.269
 is different from the other 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.980
 every one of them comes with you 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.109
 garments especially to the validity 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.950
 He has this facial expression and renÃ© 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:48.450
 has to move the shard sore 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.940
 Hall also writes one beside the model 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.069
 second career as an actor in new 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.139
 york took lessons so far he was 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:00.690
 already in a music video in short films 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:04.069
 and to see it with the theater 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.450
 Acting that's almost it 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:11.290
 somehow there is to be artist 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:14.330
 So I just know that there are many 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.800
 media with which I am concerned 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.690
 I'm sure of that 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.580
 will continue to occupy but 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.990
 but the feeling to be on stage 

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:25.970
 is unique and if you are accurate 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.730
 he did not look anything like that 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.230
 young klaus kinski but now it works 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:33.700
 for Paul week first to the next 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.700
