in<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.950> book<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.430> also<00:00:51.420> think<00:00:52.140> that<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.410> book

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
in the book I also think that the book

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.510 
in the book I also think that the book
is<00:00:53.180> hopeful<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.590> it<00:00:55.590> has<00:00:55.710> a<00:00:55.739> lot<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:55.949> comedy<00:00:56.430> in

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
is hopeful and it has a lot of comedy in

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.889 
is hopeful and it has a lot of comedy in
it<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:56.940> know<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.149> didn't<00:00:57.539> sound<00:00:57.660> like<00:00:57.780> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
it so I know that didn't sound like a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.900 
it so I know that didn't sound like a
very<00:00:58.199> comedic<00:00:58.590> set<00:00:59.070> up<00:00:59.660> but<00:01:00.710> it's<00:01:01.710> about<00:01:02.250> time

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
very comedic set up but it's about time

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.320

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
own children and then the second thing

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.590 
own children and then the second thing
that<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.780> took<00:01:45.899> was<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.710> idea<00:01:46.979> of<00:01:47.070> loss<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.700> I

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
that I took was the idea of loss and I

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.590 
that I took was the idea of loss and I
had<00:01:48.930> some<00:01:49.110> personal<00:01:49.470> loss<00:01:49.619> in<00:01:49.829> my<00:01:49.920> life<00:01:50.100> and<00:01:50.600> I

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
had some personal loss in my life and I

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.120 
had some personal loss in my life and I
put<00:01:51.840> all<00:01:52.020> those<00:01:52.140> those<00:01:52.680> three<00:01:52.950> components

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
put all those those three components

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.429 
put all those those three components
together<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.149> then<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.689> think<00:01:55.049> that<00:01:55.170> there<00:01:55.409> is

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
together and then I think that there is

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.230 
together and then I think that there is
something<00:01:56.810> that's<00:01:57.810> very<00:01:58.049> close<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:59.240> grieving

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
something that's very close in grieving

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.440 
something that's very close in grieving
and<00:02:00.649> feeling<00:02:01.649> sad<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.130> sorrowful<00:02:02.399> when<00:02:03.329> you

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
and feeling sad and sorrowful when you

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.209 
and feeling sad and sorrowful when you
cry<00:02:03.750> it's<00:02:04.229> not<00:02:04.469> that<00:02:04.649> different<00:02:04.890> sometimes

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
cry it's not that different sometimes

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.219 
cry it's not that different sometimes
from<00:02:05.670> laughing<00:02:05.909> they're<00:02:06.630> both<00:02:06.810> huge

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
from laughing they're both huge

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.490 
from laughing they're both huge
emotional<00:02:07.740> relief

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
emotional relief

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.000 
emotional relief
and<00:02:09.000> so<00:02:10.000> I<00:02:10.030> tried<00:02:10.330> to<00:02:10.720> take<00:02:11.170> those<00:02:11.349> components

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
and so I tried to take those components

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.600 
and so I tried to take those components
