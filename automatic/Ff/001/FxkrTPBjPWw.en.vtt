00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.039
 hello how about friends mates and 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.890
 youtube sisters if you make a new 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:29.439
 Windows 8 tutorial video of your friend 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.820
 to my partner master technology good 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.129
 I'm going to teach you how you 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.649
 you can customize your windows 8 like me 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:40.769
 I have here, or rather, how to put 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:43.270
 background image on your windows 8 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.030
 for example 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.010
 we will do that with a program because 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.910
 people who already have Windows 8 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.530
 you can see that windows 8 to people in 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.410
 our pc when we go to customize or 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.020
 to the configuration 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.850
 we go to home screen and some 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.700
 Very extravagant and very good options 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.800
 but it does not give us the option to examine or 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.170
 place our images on the menu 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.750
 metro start windows 8 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:13.850
 then for some people it will be a bit 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:15.280
 annoying but good here the solution here 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.420
 but what we do first 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.020
 download what is the following 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.520
 program we go to our desk in 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.299
 the description of the video leave the link 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.159
 from this page the program of being played 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.790
 and well what we say the following 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:34.549
 let's get in out the nourished and try 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.490
 free mitsui we go civil to and we place 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.979
 our mail go motor the idea does not 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.690
 have done this the download link does not 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.119
 it will come to us happens with another to our 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.280
 mail and look and good once there 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.039
 downloaded that is easily the download 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.110
 have not downloaded us as the 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.110
 program are the following 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.390
 the program will always be in the 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.760
 Sarah program on what is the menu 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.760
 meter that will be called the core 8 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.379
 well here does not leave this auxiliary you 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.810
 will leave a little window 15 test version or 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.520
 it is applied 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:18.440
 and good what we do and the next 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:20.990
 First of all it is attacking, although the bottom 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.720
 we examine some images will arrive by 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:26.930
 determined some images of our 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.740
 images that we have, I recommend you 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.830
 the images are in full hd full hd already 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:36.770
 that show bad images and not with 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.470
 good requirements or with good quality not 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.690
 we will be fine ok to select the 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.280
 that we send the ex folder and one and 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.980
 we select the folder where 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.680
 let's have the images ok 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.360
 good here for example you will leave these I 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.650
 I already have all these selected 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.650
 all these 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.280
 all these are really good 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.160
 for example good here I already have then 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.590
 this action but if for example I have 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.450
 the option of every minute 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.170
 that is done equally there and here is 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:18.470
 every time they see it and if every year every 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:21.019
 month every day every 12 hours every 4 hours 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.520
 every hour every 30 minutes of my 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.160
 account and I believe that every five minutes 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:28.440
 you will place your style they were not going 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.910
 in colors if you can as much as 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.890
 the colors that come by determined 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.720
 in windows 8 how to add a color to 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.910
 you a color that you have 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.460
 edited is already in photoshop good I do not know 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.660
 what else very important this 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:45.540
 program and very good is to place 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.900
 different rows for example place two 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.900
 rows 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:55.420
 to see 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:57.190
 well we already put rows ok but we 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:00.260
 will come out so that the two rows come out 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:04.000
 we do the following let's go over here 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:07.600
 to make us a bar and this we go 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.220
 and we go back to the menu 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:11.620
 As you can see we already have both 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:15.599
 bars giving only lines 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.599
 and well and I want it 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:24.250
 and well we do the 2000 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:26.420
 as we start let's go here we're going to 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.240
 fetch 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:32.639
 okay 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.639
 search and then we go back to the start menu 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.930
 and well I think that would be all for 

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.150
 today I hope you have them 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.950
