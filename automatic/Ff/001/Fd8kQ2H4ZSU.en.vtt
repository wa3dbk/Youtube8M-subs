advantage of the GoPro app and how it

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.450 
advantage of the GoPro app and how it
will<00:00:32.450> permit<00:00:32.930> you<00:00:33.200> to<00:00:33.410> remotely<00:00:33.710> control<00:00:34.130> the

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
don't worry the recorded video is quite

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.429 
don't worry the recorded video is quite
