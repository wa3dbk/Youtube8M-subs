00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.350
 Y 

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.350
 i 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.870
 hello welcome to my channel I'm rum and 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.880
 Today I want to show you how to do 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.880
 a middle kingdom 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:29.270
 we have already learned how to make a saint 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.610
 claus linear 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.540
 but Santa Claus can not miss 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.730
 their kingdoms then 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.450
 today I want to show you how 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.400
 we make 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.560
 queen girl 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.800
 following the same procedure as 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.380
 I have shown them to make the pencils 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.530
 third parties in children 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:56.560
 let's do the same procedure in 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:59.890
 this case I'm occupying felt in 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.730
 coffee color to make the suit and 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:05.950
 this is the only thing that we are going to change 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.340
 everything else is the same and here I leave 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:14.290
 the link on the screen to see how 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.890
 he becomes a sweetie of this kind and good 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.040
 to turn it into reindeer 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.820
 what we are going to do 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:24.500
 let's use these pieces remember 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.310
 I'm sharing the molds 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.619
 on my facebook and on twitter 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.200
 then I have here the two pieces that 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:33.369
 they form what are the squares of my 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.050
 ruler 

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:38.870
 The only thing I'm going to do with down 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.420
 Brown color 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.110
 I will highlight everything that is the shore 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.110
 of this piece 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.210
 so we are already arms books 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.790
 I want to also put a monkey here 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.000
 this part of here 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:00.060
 for which I am occupying 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.500
 but in red I made a very 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:08.170
 delgadito with felt red color 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:10.330
 and I got a little rattle 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.360
 the only thing I'm going to do is going to be 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.200
 put the bell to the monkey with a 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.200
 red thread needle 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.330
 how we already have our little monkey with 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.770
 cascabel we apply a little bit of 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:40.480
 service 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.480
 in this part of here 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.280
 and finally to give it the touch of 

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.490
 Queen 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:54.470
 let's apply some silicon in the 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:59.470
 horn and we're going to hit it behind the entity 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.470
 in this way we press and paste 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.960
 but we do the other side 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:12.350
 we apply silicone 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:12.350
 let's see the story behind the entity 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.090
 and that's how our minion is 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.810
 reyno 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:28.800
 we can leave it like this with this 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:30.790
 well without covering and putting here the sweets 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.330
 or whatever we want 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.810
 inside 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.360
 or we can also do it this way 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.370
 in this case I did the same thing that I did 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:46.060
 with the child santaclós I put a hat 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:48.880
 with felt with coffee 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.360
 and in this part of here 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.840
 I'm taking a piece 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:59.350
 of what is jute in beige you 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:02.440
 can occupy a ribbon or felt 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:05.890
 in beige to paste what is the 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:08.470
 outline of the hat and the same thing 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.080
 We tied with a piece of felt 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:14.590
 same color 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:16.780
 and that's how I closed the reindeer 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.280
 and these are the two options that I 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.610
 I give the two options look great already 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.979
 to caesar so to everyone's liking 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.310
 but they can do it that way or they can 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.139
 Do it this way 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.569
 These are the two options 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:36.009
 and to whom I also have this other 

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:38.559
 option 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:42.849
 we can do the assistants of 

00:04:38.559 --> 00:04:47.110
 santaclós in this case are elves children 

00:04:42.849 --> 00:04:50.030
 The only thing I did was put the clothes on 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:53.450
 with felt in green 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.320
 with red squares cloth I put his 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.780
 sachet 

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:00.480
 and decorate the outline of the cap of the 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.210
 we do it like we did the same 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.789
 santa claus child's hat 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:08.580
 He also made a bow with a bell and 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.940
 I stuck in this part of here here 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:16.099
 I leave you with this option and I hope that you 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:16.099
 have liked and that they put it into practice 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.500
 and see you in the next
