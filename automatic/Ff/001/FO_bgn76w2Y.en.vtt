through the game you will not have three

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.320 
through the game you will not have three
but<00:00:25.470> if<00:00:25.710> that's<00:00:26.670> not<00:00:26.789> important<00:00:27.150> all<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.240> have

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
but if that's not important all I have

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.550 
but if that's not important all I have
to<00:00:27.390> do<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.570> just<00:00:27.660> hit<00:00:27.840> left<00:00:28.109> bumper<00:00:28.410> while

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
to do is just hit left bumper while

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.740 
to do is just hit left bumper while
looking<00:00:29.010> at<00:00:29.250> enemies<00:00:29.849> once<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.449> your

looking at enemies once and your

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.280 
looking at enemies once and your

the<00:00:34.290> reason<00:00:34.559> I<00:00:34.649> have<00:00:34.829> three<00:00:35.040> right<00:00:35.160> now<00:00:35.219> is

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
the reason I have three right now is

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.420 
the reason I have three right now is
because<00:00:36.000> I'm<00:00:36.600> recording<00:00:36.989> from<00:00:37.739> much<00:00:37.980> later

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
because I'm recording from much later

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.080 
because I'm recording from much later
point<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.910> game<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.270> using<00:00:39.660> me<00:00:40.700> the<00:00:41.700> menus

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
point in the game and using me the menus

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.760 
point in the game and using me the menus
to<00:00:42.300> replay<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:42.960> old<00:00:43.140> mission<00:00:43.469> just<00:00:43.649> so<00:00:43.710> I

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
to replay this old mission just so I

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.369 
to replay this old mission just so I
could<00:00:43.920> record<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.399> but<00:00:45.030> which<00:00:45.809> which<00:00:46.260> actually

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
could record it but which which actually

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.510 
could record it but which which actually
helps<00:00:46.800> out<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> lot<00:00:47.070> with<00:00:47.219> some<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
helps out a lot with some of the

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.200 
helps out a lot with some of the
trickier

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
trickier

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.720 
trickier
it's<00:00:49.170> 100%<00:00:49.770> sync<00:00:50.129> challenges<00:00:50.489> even<00:00:50.670> though

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
it's 100% sync challenges even though

it's 100% sync challenges even though
there's<00:00:50.940> not<00:00:51.059> a<00:00:51.090> lot<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.329> them<00:00:51.949> anyway

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
there's not a lot of them anyway
