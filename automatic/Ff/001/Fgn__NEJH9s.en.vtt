00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:02.550
 the 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.550
 9 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:11.359
 also 

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.580
 yes there are two things when it comes to must address the issues 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.470
 Everyone knows that there are a lot of schools that are clients 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.880
 Alkmaar Az that fund is that Americanize from other much 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:29.820
 Abusive times it could have been that the total economy questions are now cyclical mancebo 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:30.529
 I'm getting here 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.290
 cyclically low the government can bridge that period of deficit by now 

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:37.770
 to stimulate expats 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.040
 everything revolves around the Sande Keynesian policy 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.770
 sturm a weak period and knew it takes a strong period and it 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.390
 is also very logical in Germany and we also hope to see England 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.960
 you now work against it, but the debt has gone very far 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.770
 so much so that the guilty lunks obstruct me in the 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.610
 future and now we just have to take a step back 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.739
 it's a tricky bath to have to indent a jump or just go to 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.420
 structurally it is not entirely possible to give up 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.690
 Piet clear that the stock market was going the way you think 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.570
 just still considered that coincidentally mussel farmers are so van 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.660
 commodity bird of prey to the euro for real estate 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:23.830
 also make the note that we have the 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:28.420
 we allow our clients to consider overweight stocks to still have good fabrics 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.549
 but that is mainly because it is very sustainable resources to hold as 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.220
 investment 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.750
 among other things created on the market with my contracts 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.010
 friends actually applies if your legs are around another short 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.550
 the resurrection 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.650
 it is a period of time not to take too great artificial theft is not necessary 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:49.390
 to be brave the market is just very moving I am the vase 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.490
 is that what risky the post can nevertheless not be that cheaper of whole 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.510
 safe havens 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.650
 investing with a long-term horizon is always wise 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.990
 now time has to be much wiser several 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:04.810
 dump positions 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.009
 to imagine and not 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.369
 of which you do not know and in the short term we do not know our money yields money can 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.319
 longer-term costs you know for sure that you will get a problem again 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:16.039
 shortest in mobility 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:19.449
 when it hurt even more such a principle or it can hurt a lot 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:22.509
 I have said it before, it is a cry for help from low economic growth 

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:26.919
 That means a shock for example BP but also found Greece or through 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.769
 policy at the end of 2009 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.549
 that shock with a huge impact on the portfolio 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.029
 they can have a huge impact, you never know where they come from 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.370
 it is that you have to spread well in your wallet or mine after many things 

00:02:39.369 --> 00:02:42.369
 and do not have the big positions 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.260
 Have a clear eye for the risks What are the major risks involved? 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:52.259
 TNT Airways was previously in Veenendaal, but Zendani was already rising considerably 

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:55.839
 While I am here now to make my job possible that is at risk 

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:56.579
 put 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:58.459
 They want 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.959
 Before there is a solid core position to go but the positions do not stand them 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:03.729
 to put 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:07.549
 A good eye for the risks of it is a time of a shocking effect 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.449
 can play a big role now there is a very interesting time it is a lot 

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:15.439
 More difficult that journey that many people struggle to plan the real 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.979
 to see a direction is also not real 

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:21.370
 He was already told him to have long-term leaflets 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.090
 it was very difficult at this time in all directions except a clear one 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.309
 direction 

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:27.409
 it is not fun 

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:28.479
 together here 

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:29.589
 and difficult
