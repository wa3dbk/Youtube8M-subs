00:00:02.183 --> 00:00:03.720
 For systolic heart failure 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:05.741
 the heart can not pump as hard as before, 

00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:08.017
 so it does not push so much blood out 

00:00:08.017 --> 00:00:10.082
 and does not meet the needs of the body. 

00:00:10.082 --> 00:00:11.639
 It is called systolic heart failure, 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.055
 because we are talking about the systole, 

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:14.715
 which is the phase of the cardiac cycle, 

00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:17.132
 where the heart is squeezed and pushes blood 

00:00:17.132 --> 00:00:19.220
 to the body or to the lungs. 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.553
 You can imagine it as a clench 

00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:22.714
 and pushing the water out. 

00:00:22.714 --> 00:00:24.676
 Here is also something, except the heart instead 

00:00:24.676 --> 00:00:27.363
 pushes blood. 

00:00:27.363 --> 00:00:30.876
 For systolic heart failure, this reductive force 

00:00:30.876 --> 00:00:33.547
 or this crushing force is much lower. 

00:00:33.547 --> 00:00:36.141
 Sometimes we say that this has reduced inotropy, 

00:00:36.141 --> 00:00:39.360
 which means strength of muscle contraction. 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.939
 We will talk about ventricular inotropy, 

00:00:41.939 --> 00:00:43.797
 what is the power of this ventricle, 

00:00:43.797 --> 00:00:45.532
 or those large cavities. 

00:00:45.532 --> 00:00:47.505
 Imagine pressing the same bottle, 

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.992
 but just press it with two fingers. 

00:00:50.632 --> 00:00:51.880
 You can imagine it will be much harder 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.822
 to push the water out. 

00:00:53.822 --> 00:00:55.557
 The same is done with weakened muscles. 

00:00:55.557 --> 00:00:56.637
 If they are smaller and weaker, 

00:00:56.637 --> 00:00:58.850
 it will be much harder to push the blood out 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.491
 and the impact volume will be reduced, 

00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:01.919
 and the body will not get so much blood, 

00:01:01.919 --> 00:01:03.471
 as before. 

00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:06.561
 All this is due to the weakened heart muscle. 

00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:09.278
 But how does that muscle weaken? 

00:01:09.278 --> 00:01:12.556
 It is usually caused by some underlying disease, 

00:01:12.556 --> 00:01:15.131
 which kills the heart muscle cells, 

00:01:15.131 --> 00:01:17.261
 or cardiomyocytes. 

00:01:18.823 --> 00:01:20.590
 I'll draw some of these cardiomyocytes 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.491
 and they, one kind, hold hands, 

00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:26.007
 so when they are shortened, they pull each other. 

00:01:26.007 --> 00:01:28.040
 When they pull each other, they become a little smaller, 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.965
 and this causes the ejection movement, 

00:01:30.965 --> 00:01:33.441
 but what if a few of these cells die? 

00:01:33.441 --> 00:01:35.156
 I mean, obviously they will not pull so hard 

00:01:35.156 --> 00:01:37.456
 and there will be no such good ejection movement, 

00:01:37.456 --> 00:01:39.232
 and the heart will not push so much blood, 

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:41.333
 as before. 

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.958
 If you look at this heart and compare it 

00:01:42.958 --> 00:01:45.548
 you will hardly see, less these walls 

00:01:45.548 --> 00:01:48.949
 are much thinner and these ventricles are much larger. 

00:01:48.949 --> 00:01:50.272
 These are the classic signs of a heart 

00:01:50.272 --> 00:01:51.981
 with systolic heart failure. 

00:01:53.671 --> 00:01:56.208
 Which are some of these underlying diseases? 

00:01:56.208 --> 00:01:59.112
 There are four categories. 

00:01:59.112 --> 00:02:01.949
 The first category is cardio-muscular diseases 

00:02:01.949 --> 00:02:02.914
 we will call them times 

00:02:02.914 --> 00:02:05.191
 just cardiomyopathies. 

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:07.408
 You can divide this into cardio, 

00:02:07.408 --> 00:02:09.614
 which means heart, muscle, which means muscle, 

00:02:09.614 --> 00:02:11.956
 and a duck, which means disease. 

00:02:11.956 --> 00:02:15.320
 Typically, the cause will be unknown, 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.937
 but generally weaken the heart muscle 

00:02:17.937 --> 00:02:20.486
 and make it harder to pump blood. 

00:02:21.206 --> 00:02:23.313
 The second category is not so straightforward. 

00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:25.530
 It has reduced blood supply, 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.771
 but I'm not talking about blood supply to the body, 

00:02:27.771 --> 00:02:30.828
 I'm talking about the heart. 

00:02:31.578 --> 00:02:34.191
 Coronary artery disease is a major cause 

00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:36.740
 for systolic heart failure, because coronary heart failure 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.562
 arteries supply the heart with blood. 

00:02:40.082 --> 00:02:41.574
 Let me clear things a little 

00:02:41.574 --> 00:02:44.511
 and to move these people here, 

00:02:44.511 --> 00:02:45.951
 and I will draw several vessels, 

00:02:45.951 --> 00:02:47.693
 which reach the cells of the heart muscle. 

00:02:47.693 --> 00:02:49.631
 These will be our coronary arteries, 

00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:51.034
 in fact, it is only one, 

00:02:51.034 --> 00:02:53.297
 so it will be a coronary artery. 

00:02:53.897 --> 00:02:55.273
 Usually the blood goes down 

00:02:55.273 --> 00:02:58.664
 and delivers oxygen to these muscle cells, 

00:02:58.664 --> 00:03:00.730
 but there is a narrowing in coronary artery disease 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.605
 of the vessel due to accumulation of plaque 

00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:05.701
 and this build-up reduces blood supply 

00:03:05.701 --> 00:03:08.608
 of the muscle cells and these cells begin to die, 

00:03:08.608 --> 00:03:10.820
 as we know it is not good, 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:12.792
 because when the muscle cells die, 

00:03:12.792 --> 00:03:16.804
 the muscle weakens and the pumping of the blood is hampered. 

00:03:17.674 --> 00:03:20.489
 If we go one step ahead and this plaque buildup is so much, 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.292
 that it completely obstructs or blocks this vessel, 

00:03:24.292 --> 00:03:26.853
 then none of these cells get any oxygen 

00:03:26.853 --> 00:03:29.371
 and all of them die. 

00:03:29.371 --> 00:03:32.087
 This is very serious, because the whole area 

00:03:32.087 --> 00:03:34.978
 of cells can die and also cause heart attacks 

00:03:34.978 --> 00:03:38.530
 to be a major cause of systolic heart failure. 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.874
 The third class of diseases 

00:03:41.874 --> 00:03:44.451
 are diseases of the valves. 

00:03:44.451 --> 00:03:45.961
 The heart has four valves. 

00:03:45.961 --> 00:03:48.224
 Two valves separate the top and bottom valves 

00:03:48.224 --> 00:03:51.011
 and two valves separate the lower chambers, 

00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:52.485
 according to where the blood goes, 

00:03:52.485 --> 00:03:54.726
 whether to the body or to the lungs. 

00:03:54.726 --> 00:03:56.548
 If we start with the valves they separate 

00:03:56.548 --> 00:03:58.510
 the two cameras, we can talk about something, 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.345
 called regurgitation. 

00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:02.260
 This means the lower chambers 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.635
 they let the blood go back to the upper chambers. 

00:04:05.635 --> 00:04:07.511
 If we look at how this heart beats, 

00:04:07.511 --> 00:04:11.048
 usually these valves close when the blood is pumped out, 

00:04:11.048 --> 00:04:13.626
 but regurgitation means that these valves remain 

00:04:13.626 --> 00:04:16.180
 slightly open and let some of the blood come back 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.651
 in the upper chambers. 

00:04:18.664 --> 00:04:20.714
 The blood is pumped again, 

00:04:20.714 --> 00:04:22.484
 but part of it misses going into the upper chambers, 

00:04:22.484 --> 00:04:25.049
 so, of course, this blood that goes goes is lost 

00:04:25.049 --> 00:04:26.826
 in the upper chambers and the body 

00:04:26.826 --> 00:04:28.765
 less blood is pumped. 

00:04:28.765 --> 00:04:32.164
 If we imagine our favorite analogy with the bottle of water, 

00:04:32.164 --> 00:04:34.943
 now it's like a hole on one side, 

00:04:34.943 --> 00:04:36.044
 every time you press it, 

00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:37.344
 most of the water will come out, 

00:04:37.344 --> 00:04:40.001
 but part of it will run through the hole. 

00:04:40.001 --> 00:04:41.663
 Now that less blood is pumped, 

00:04:41.663 --> 00:04:43.462
 the heart has to work harder to maintain 

00:04:43.462 --> 00:04:46.035
 the same level as before, 

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:47.978
 and more work takes more oxygen, 

00:04:47.978 --> 00:04:49.801
 but the problem of heart failure is that 

00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:52.085
 can not deliver more oxygen 

00:04:52.085 --> 00:04:55.025
 and as a result, more cells die. 

00:04:57.975 --> 00:04:59.321
 The other flap disease is associated with 

00:04:59.321 --> 00:05:00.563
 these two other valves. 

00:05:00.563 --> 00:05:03.165
 It's called stenosis and that means blood 

00:05:03.165 --> 00:05:05.218
 is pumped out through this smaller hole, 

00:05:05.218 --> 00:05:07.818
 which greatly impedes the pumping of blood. 

00:05:10.498 --> 00:05:12.409
 Let's look at our bottle of water, 

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:15.497
 but this time the hole is super small. 

00:05:15.497 --> 00:05:16.862
 Imagine trying to squeeze the water through 

00:05:16.862 --> 00:05:18.058
 this less throat. 

00:05:18.058 --> 00:05:20.282
 It will be much harder, will not it? 

00:05:20.282 --> 00:05:21.959
 It turns out that it is for the heart muscle 

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:23.724
 much harder to push blood 

00:05:23.724 --> 00:05:25.341
 through a smaller hole. 

00:05:25.341 --> 00:05:27.018
 As with regurgitation, 

00:05:27.018 --> 00:05:28.703
 now the heart muscle has to work more to maintain 

00:05:28.703 --> 00:05:30.433
 also the same amount of blood, 

00:05:30.433 --> 00:05:33.857
 and more work is equal to more oxygen that can not be delivered, 

00:05:33.857 --> 00:05:35.792
 so more cells die. 

00:05:36.958 --> 00:05:38.279
 Recent arrhythmias, 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.145
 which means abnormal heart rhythm. 

00:05:42.145 --> 00:05:44.500
 This may be a rhythm that is either too slow, 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.680
 or too fast or even uncoordinated. 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.180
 Uncoordinated means cameras 

00:05:50.184 --> 00:05:52.526
 do not shorten at the same time. 

00:05:52.526 --> 00:05:54.384
 Usually, they are cut off at the same time, 

00:05:54.384 --> 00:05:56.857
 but maybe the left is now ahead of the right 

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:59.603
 or the right overtakes the left. 

00:06:00.063 --> 00:06:02.382
 In both cases, this leads to a serious reduction 

00:06:02.382 --> 00:06:05.076
 the efficiency of pumping, which means that the body is pumped 

00:06:05.076 --> 00:06:06.973
 less blood. 

00:06:06.973 --> 00:06:08.361
 With a relatively similar mechanism, 

00:06:08.361 --> 00:06:10.962
 which we talked about before, most of the work 

00:06:10.962 --> 00:06:14.399
 means an increased need for oxygen and more cell death. 

00:06:14.399 --> 00:06:16.415
 We're starting to see this model, do not you? 

00:06:16.415 --> 00:06:19.050
 In which each of these things reduces the pumping ability 

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.459
 and this hinders the heart at 

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:22.641
 maintaining the same amount of blood. 

00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:24.998
 These cells, which work harder, will need more oxygen, 

00:06:24.998 --> 00:06:26.693
 but the oxygen can not be delivered 

00:06:26.693 --> 00:06:28.701
 and these muscle cells die. 

00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:30.733
 When they die, the heart is weakening 

00:06:30.733 --> 00:06:34.303
 and the pumping capability is further reduced. 

00:06:35.023 --> 00:06:37.898
 We see that the pumping ability is extremely important. 

00:06:37.898 --> 00:06:39.556
 One way to measure pumping capability 

00:06:39.556 --> 00:06:41.598
 is through the ejection fraction, 

00:06:41.598 --> 00:06:44.970
 which is the percentage of blood ejected with each stroke. 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:48.486
 If we look at our bottle of water, 

00:06:48.486 --> 00:06:50.862
 we can take the total volume 

00:06:50.862 --> 00:06:54.165
 and we can take the total displaced volume, 

00:06:54.785 --> 00:06:56.860
 and if we divide the displaced volume 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.986
 of the total filled volume, 

00:06:58.986 --> 00:07:01.993
 and then multiply it by 100 to get rates, 

00:07:01.993 --> 00:07:04.304
 we get the ejection fraction. 

00:07:05.254 --> 00:07:07.259
 Usually we are talking about a faction of expulsion 

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:09.915
 of the left ventricle, but we can look at it 

00:07:09.915 --> 00:07:12.722
 the right ventricular ejection fraction. 

00:07:14.142 --> 00:07:17.411
 The normal value is about 55% to 70% 

00:07:17.411 --> 00:07:19.400
 and index values ​​are 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.723
 between 40% and 55%, as evidence of heart failure 

00:07:23.723 --> 00:07:26.186
 is anything less than 40%
