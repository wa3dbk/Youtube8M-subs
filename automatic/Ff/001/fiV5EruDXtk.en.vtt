Dark<00:02:25.760> Crystal<00:02:25.880> figures<00:02:26.420> I'm<00:02:26.870> hoping<00:02:27.140> at<00:02:27.319> some

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
Dark Crystal figures I'm hoping at some

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.450 
Dark Crystal figures I'm hoping at some
point<00:02:27.710> they<00:02:27.860> will<00:02:28.069> but<00:02:28.540> I<00:02:30.069> think<00:02:31.069> this<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.430> is

point they will but I think this one is
it<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:31.790> one<00:02:31.940> is<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.120> start<00:02:32.540> of<00:02:32.750> how<00:02:32.960> well<00:02:33.260> you

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
it this one is a start of how well you

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.140 
it this one is a start of how well you
make<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.860> Dark<00:02:34.069> Crystal<00:02:34.190> figure<00:02:34.640> and<00:02:34.850> how

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
make the Dark Crystal figure and how

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.120 
make the Dark Crystal figure and how
well<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.540> can<00:02:35.660> turn<00:02:35.780> out<00:02:35.840> so<00:02:36.620> we<00:02:36.770> only<00:02:36.950> further

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
well it can turn out so we only further

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.400 
well it can turn out so we only further
ado<00:02:37.340> let's<00:02:38.120> get<00:02:38.210> a<00:02:38.270> look<00:02:38.390> at<00:02:38.480> the<00:02:38.540> detail<00:02:38.810> so

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
now aside from that though even though

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.900 
now aside from that though even though
this<00:04:24.110> toy<00:04:24.440> this<00:04:24.890> toy<00:04:25.160> isn't<00:04:25.490> for<00:04:25.580> playing<00:04:25.760> was

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:25.910 
this toy this toy isn't for playing was

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.740 
this toy this toy isn't for playing was
just<00:04:26.090> let<00:04:26.180> me<00:04:26.240> get<00:04:26.360> it<00:04:26.450> all<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:26.600> way

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
just let me get it all the way

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:28.300 
just let me get it all the way
um<00:04:26.930> this<00:04:27.200> toy<00:04:27.350> is<00:04:27.470> not<00:04:27.500> for<00:04:27.710> playing<00:04:27.860> with<00:04:28.040> it's

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.310 
um this toy is not for playing with it's

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:31.390 
um this toy is not for playing with it's
mainly<00:04:28.580> for<00:04:28.790> having<00:04:29.120> on<00:04:29.210> display<00:04:29.570> but<00:04:30.400> with

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
mainly for having on display but with

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.430 
mainly for having on display but with
that<00:04:31.490> being<00:04:31.669> said<00:04:32.000> I<00:04:32.210> do<00:04:32.330> think<00:04:32.570> that<00:04:32.900> this<00:04:33.140> toy

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
that being said I do think that this toy

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.230 
that being said I do think that this toy
itself<00:04:33.950> doesn't<00:04:34.550> really<00:04:34.640> need<00:04:34.850> to<00:04:34.910> be<00:04:35.000> played

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
itself doesn't really need to be played

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.270 
itself doesn't really need to be played
with<00:04:35.390> because<00:04:35.919> articulation<00:04:36.919> for<00:04:37.010> this<00:04:37.130> toy

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
with because articulation for this toy

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.920 
with because articulation for this toy
is<00:04:37.400> quite<00:04:37.700> limited<00:04:37.910> because<00:04:38.210> even<00:04:38.720> though<00:04:38.810> the

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930 
is quite limited because even though the

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.770 
is quite limited because even though the
legs<00:04:39.430> have<00:04:40.430> no<00:04:40.640> movement<00:04:40.880> nothing<00:04:41.660> very

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
legs have no movement nothing very

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.210 
legs have no movement nothing very
unpleasant<00:04:42.229> under<00:04:42.380> here<00:04:42.530> it's<00:04:42.650> just<00:04:42.710> a<00:04:42.890> it's

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
unpleasant under here it's just a it's

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.060 
unpleasant under here it's just a it's
just<00:04:43.250> a<00:04:43.400> big<00:04:43.550> bulging<00:04:43.970> water<00:04:44.780> skin<00:04:45.260> whereas

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
just a big bulging water skin whereas

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.120 
just a big bulging water skin whereas
the<00:04:46.160> legs<00:04:46.370> are<00:04:46.550> but<00:04:47.440> articulation<00:04:48.440> aside<00:04:48.620> his

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
the legs are but articulation aside his

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:51.250 
the legs are but articulation aside his
head<00:04:49.400> can<00:04:49.729> rotate<00:04:49.760> the<00:04:50.300> full<00:04:50.450> 360<00:04:50.990> which

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
head can rotate the full 360 which

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:53.469 
head can rotate the full 360 which
that's<00:04:51.680> really<00:04:52.400> all<00:04:52.610> it<00:04:52.640> can<00:04:52.970> do<00:04:53.180> it's<00:04:53.360> on<00:04:53.450> a

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479 
that's really all it can do it's on a

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.900 
that's really all it can do it's on a
ball<00:04:53.720> joint<00:04:53.750> and<00:04:54.140> of<00:04:54.770> course

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
ball joint and of course

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.900 
ball joint and of course
the<00:04:56.360> arms<00:04:57.100> can<00:04:58.100> move<00:04:58.600> up<00:05:00.040> there<00:05:01.040> one<00:05:01.760> thing

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
the arms can move up there one thing

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.950 
the arms can move up there one thing
this<00:05:02.060> was<00:05:02.210> that<00:05:02.390> you've<00:05:02.480> got<00:05:02.570> to<00:05:02.660> be<00:05:02.720> really

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
this was that you've got to be really

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.300 
this was that you've got to be really
careful<00:05:03.140> with<00:05:03.410> these<00:05:03.530> arms<00:05:03.830> because<00:05:04.010> they<00:05:04.160> are

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
careful with these arms because they are

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.340 
careful with these arms because they are
so<00:05:04.670> fragile<00:05:04.970> and<00:05:05.420> the<00:05:05.570> law<00:05:05.720> of<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.900> mecha<00:05:06.050> toys

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
so fragile and the law of the mecha toys

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.040 
so fragile and the law of the mecha toys
are<00:05:06.650> fragile<00:05:07.160> in<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.490> lot<00:05:07.670> of<00:05:07.760> the<00:05:07.850> designs<00:05:08.180> the

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
are fragile in a lot of the designs the

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:10.660 
are fragile in a lot of the designs the
arms<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:09.590> the<00:05:09.650> weaponry<00:05:09.950> as<00:05:10.250> well<00:05:10.460> they're

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
arms and the weaponry as well they're

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.670 
arms and the weaponry as well they're
quite<00:05:10.820> fragile<00:05:11.090> and<00:05:11.600> of<00:05:11.900> course<00:05:12.110> it<00:05:12.290> does<00:05:12.470> have

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
quite fragile and of course it does have

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:15.010 
quite fragile and of course it does have
some<00:05:12.920> good<00:05:12.950> elements<00:05:13.340> so<00:05:14.060> you<00:05:14.330> can<00:05:14.900> either

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 
some good elements so you can either

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.950 
some good elements so you can either
have<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.380> arms<00:05:15.740> going<00:05:19.240> the<00:05:20.240> hands<00:05:20.660> as<00:05:20.780> well

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
have the arms going the hands as well

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.660 
have the arms going the hands as well
and<00:05:21.260> the<00:05:21.860> hands<00:05:22.190> you<00:05:22.250> got<00:05:22.370> to<00:05:22.460> be<00:05:22.520> really

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
and the hands you got to be really

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:23.920 
and the hands you got to be really
careful<00:05:22.820> as<00:05:23.120> well<00:05:23.300> and<00:05:23.450> when<00:05:23.600> you<00:05:23.690> take<00:05:23.840> this

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:23.930 
careful as well and when you take this

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:26.890 
careful as well and when you take this
try<00:05:24.110> out<00:05:24.200> the<00:05:24.290> packaging<00:05:25.300> these<00:05:26.300> hands<00:05:26.810> are

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
try out the packaging these hands are

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.330 
try out the packaging these hands are
quite<00:05:27.020> fragile<00:05:27.320> they're<00:05:27.680> made<00:05:27.860> of<00:05:27.980> very<00:05:28.160> thin

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
quite fragile they're made of very thin

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.240 
quite fragile they're made of very thin
plastic<00:05:28.460> and<00:05:28.880> they<00:05:28.970> can<00:05:29.240> but<00:05:30.020> I<00:05:30.080> can't<00:05:30.320> snap<00:05:30.740> so

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
plastic and they can but I can't snap so

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:32.590 
plastic and they can but I can't snap so
be<00:05:31.370> very<00:05:31.460> careful<00:05:31.700> with<00:05:31.910> them<00:05:32.030> and<00:05:32.210> then<00:05:32.420> of

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:32.600 
be very careful with them and then of

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.150 
be very careful with them and then of
course<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.930> hands<00:05:33.320> have<00:05:33.650> some<00:05:33.800> good<00:05:33.920> wrist

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 
course the hands have some good wrist

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:35.740 
course the hands have some good wrist
articulation<00:05:34.310> they<00:05:34.730> can<00:05:34.880> rotate<00:05:35.000> for<00:05:35.300> 360

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:35.750 
articulation they can rotate for 360

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:39.540 
articulation they can rotate for 360
which<00:05:36.760> that's<00:05:37.760> pretty<00:05:37.940> good

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
which that's pretty good

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:42.520 
which that's pretty good
so<00:05:40.550> it's<00:05:40.910> trying<00:05:41.630> to<00:05:41.750> get<00:05:41.870> this<00:05:41.960> guy<00:05:42.200> at<00:05:42.350> least

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
so it's trying to get this guy at least

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.440 
so it's trying to get this guy at least
one<00:05:42.860> good<00:05:43.100> look<00:05:43.340> is<00:05:43.550> hard<00:05:43.820> enough<00:05:44.060> because

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
one good look is hard enough because

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.090 
one good look is hard enough because
he's<00:05:44.960> not<00:05:45.110> poseable<00:05:45.620> and<00:05:45.710> you<00:05:45.770> can't<00:05:45.980> play

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:46.100 
he's not poseable and you can't play

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:48.460 
he's not poseable and you can't play
with<00:05:46.190> him<00:05:46.430> but<00:05:47.000> I<00:05:47.330> think<00:05:47.690> this<00:05:47.990> is<00:05:48.080> the<00:05:48.230> best<00:05:48.410> I

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
with him but I think this is the best I

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:51.760 
with him but I think this is the best I
can<00:05:48.590> come<00:05:48.740> up<00:05:48.800> with<00:05:48.980> him<00:05:50.140> evil<00:05:51.140> as<00:05:51.380> the

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
can come up with him evil as the

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:53.890 
can come up with him evil as the
character<00:05:52.160> is<00:05:52.370> and<00:05:52.760> just<00:05:53.180> really<00:05:53.540> awesome<00:05:53.690> to

articulation as well like I said limited

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:49.750
