00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
hello everyone today I'm going to be

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.459 
hello everyone today I'm going to be
doing<00:00:06.060> a<00:00:06.480> review<00:00:07.080> on<00:00:07.319> the<00:00:07.740> one<00:00:08.130> step<00:00:08.519> looper

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:09.469 
doing a review on the one step looper

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.009 
doing a review on the one step looper
this<00:00:10.469> is<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.769> tool<00:00:10.980> here<00:00:11.480> the<00:00:12.480> first<00:00:12.750> thing<00:00:12.929> I

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
this is the tool here the first thing I

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.740 
this is the tool here the first thing I
noticed<00:00:13.410> is<00:00:13.650> that<00:00:13.730> it<00:00:14.730> does<00:00:15.059> have<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.389> pretty

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
noticed is that it does have a pretty

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.400 
noticed is that it does have a pretty
wide<00:00:16.139> grip<00:00:16.920> where<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.210> have<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.930> pretty<00:00:19.199> much

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
wide grip where I have to pretty much

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.300 
wide grip where I have to pretty much
hold<00:00:19.740> it<00:00:19.920> in<00:00:20.039> my<00:00:20.480> pinky<00:00:21.480> and<00:00:21.570> my<00:00:21.720> thumb<00:00:22.160> to<00:00:23.160> get

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
hold it in my pinky and my thumb to get

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.460 
hold it in my pinky and my thumb to get
it<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.580> work<00:00:23.990> it<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.080> a<00:00:25.109> little<00:00:25.320> bit

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
it to work it is a little bit

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.890 
it to work it is a little bit
uncomfortable<00:00:25.800> at<00:00:26.099> first<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:26.490> I<00:00:27.060> got<00:00:27.420> used<00:00:27.750> to

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
uncomfortable at first but I got used to

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.460 
uncomfortable at first but I got used to
it<00:00:27.990> fairly<00:00:28.560> quickly<00:00:29.689> but<00:00:30.689> somewhat<00:00:31.109> smaller

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
it fairly quickly but somewhat smaller

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.139 
it fairly quickly but somewhat smaller
hands<00:00:32.009> might<00:00:32.250> be<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> little<00:00:32.669> bit<00:00:32.910> more

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
hands might be a little bit more

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.479 
hands might be a little bit more
uncomfortable<00:00:33.950> there's<00:00:34.950> a<00:00:35.040> few<00:00:35.190> components

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
uncomfortable there's a few components

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.780 
uncomfortable there's a few components
to<00:00:35.760> this<00:00:36.239> tool<00:00:36.600> that<00:00:37.590> you<00:00:37.649> need<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.950> know<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
to this tool that you need to know the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.569 
to this tool that you need to know the
first<00:00:39.030> one<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.629> pin<00:00:40.140> up<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:41.129> at<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.340> top

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
first one is this pin up here at the top

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.520 
first one is this pin up here at the top
this<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.540> what<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.930> loop<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.290> going<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.469> be

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
this is what the loop is going to be

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.010 
this is what the loop is going to be
formed<00:00:43.950> around<00:00:44.840> this<00:00:45.840> piece<00:00:46.140> right<00:00:46.350> here<00:00:46.410> is

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
formed around this piece right here is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.619 
formed around this piece right here is
the<00:00:49.020> cutter<00:00:49.950> that's<00:00:50.820> what's<00:00:51.059> going<00:00:51.270> to<00:00:51.329> cut

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
the cutter that's what's going to cut

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.619 
the cutter that's what's going to cut
you<00:00:52.230> have<00:00:52.440> a<00:00:52.469> head<00:00:52.620> pin<00:00:52.829> or<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> wire<00:00:53.510> and<00:00:54.510> then

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
you have a head pin or the wire and then

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.720 
you have a head pin or the wire and then
you<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.840> a<00:00:54.870> hole<00:00:55.199> here<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.250> other<00:00:56.489> end

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
you have a hole here at the other end

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.069 
you have a hole here at the other end
and<00:00:57.090> what<00:00:57.210> that's<00:00:57.390> going<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.629> do<00:00:57.840> is<00:00:57.930> gonna

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
and what that's going to do is gonna

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.279 
and what that's going to do is gonna
allow<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.500> pretty<00:00:58.859> much<00:00:59.010> fit<00:00:59.430> any<00:01:00.289> length

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
allow you to pretty much fit any length

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.679 
allow you to pretty much fit any length
of<00:01:01.680> wire<00:01:02.280> or<00:01:02.820> pin<00:01:03.809> into<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:05.299> okay<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:06.360> I'm<00:01:06.570> going

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
of wire or pin into it okay so I'm going

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.820 
of wire or pin into it okay so I'm going
to<00:01:06.810> start<00:01:07.080> out<00:01:07.229> I'm<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.040> gonna<00:01:08.280> grab<00:01:09.680> an<00:01:10.680> eye

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
to start out I'm just gonna grab an eye

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:20.280 
to start out I'm just gonna grab an eye
pin<00:01:12.170> and<00:01:13.170> I'm<00:01:13.380> gonna<00:01:13.500> thread<00:01:13.920> a<00:01:14.840> bead

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.710 

now<00:01:21.220> I'm<00:01:21.400> going<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.730> want<00:01:21.880> to<00:01:21.970> make<00:01:22.090> a<00:01:22.150> loop<00:01:22.390> on

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:22.720 
now I'm going to want to make a loop on

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.160 
now I'm going to want to make a loop on
this<00:01:23.110> side<00:01:23.850> so<00:01:24.850> what<00:01:25.000> I'm<00:01:25.060> gonna<00:01:25.150> do<00:01:25.390> is<00:01:25.960> I'm

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
this side so what I'm gonna do is I'm

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:31.470 
this side so what I'm gonna do is I'm
going<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.350> go<00:01:26.500> under<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.160> pin<00:01:28.740> over<00:01:30.480> the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
going to go under the pin over the

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.120 
going to go under the pin over the
cutter<00:01:31.750> and<00:01:32.940> through<00:01:33.940> the<00:01:34.120> hole<00:01:34.360> okay<00:01:35.320> so

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.130 
cutter and through the hole okay so

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.250 
cutter and through the hole okay so
again<00:01:36.220> I'll<00:01:36.460> go<00:01:36.550> under<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.030> pin<00:01:37.270> over<00:01:37.810> the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
again I'll go under the pin over the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:44.730 
again I'll go under the pin over the
cutter<00:01:38.470> and<00:01:40.020> through<00:01:41.020> the<00:01:41.380> hole<00:01:43.500> one<00:01:44.500> thing<00:01:44.680> I

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
cutter and through the hole one thing I

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.130 
cutter and through the hole one thing I
noticed<00:01:45.070> about<00:01:45.160> this<00:01:45.520> is<00:01:45.790> that<00:01:46.140> sometimes

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
noticed about this is that sometimes

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.730 
noticed about this is that sometimes
there<00:01:47.890> is<00:01:48.100> a<00:01:48.370> space<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.390> between<00:01:49.660> the<00:01:50.230> loop<00:01:50.500> and

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
there is a space in between the loop and

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.430 
there is a space in between the loop and
the<00:01:51.070> bead<00:01:51.340> I<00:01:51.720> did<00:01:52.720> figure<00:01:53.080> out<00:01:53.170> a<00:01:53.200> way<00:01:53.410> to

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
the bead I did figure out a way to

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.900 
the bead I did figure out a way to
pretty<00:01:54.430> much<00:01:54.610> fix<00:01:54.910> this<00:01:55.120> for<00:01:55.420> myself<00:01:55.930> I

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:56.910 
pretty much fix this for myself I

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:59.219 
pretty much fix this for myself I
haven't<00:01:57.910> really<00:01:58.360> had<00:01:58.510> any<00:01:58.570> issues<00:01:58.990> with<00:01:59.020> it

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
haven't really had any issues with it

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.370 
haven't really had any issues with it
after<00:01:59.710> I<00:01:59.740> did<00:02:00.040> this<00:02:00.220> what<00:02:00.970> you<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:01.450> you

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
after I did this what you do is you

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.560 
after I did this what you do is you
start<00:02:02.770> to<00:02:02.800> squeeze<00:02:03.190> and<00:02:03.520> then<00:02:03.790> you<00:02:03.910> nudge<00:02:04.210> it<00:02:04.420> a

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
start to squeeze and then you nudge it a

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.930 
start to squeeze and then you nudge it a
little<00:02:04.810> bit<00:02:05.220> just<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.310> get<00:02:06.490> the<00:02:06.610> bead<00:02:06.790> a<00:02:06.820> little

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 
little bit just to get the bead a little

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.380 
little bit just to get the bead a little
bit<00:02:07.540> closer<00:02:07.840> to<00:02:08.229> this<00:02:08.380> end<00:02:08.530> here<00:02:09.100> and<00:02:09.880> it's

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:10.390 
bit closer to this end here and it's

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:15.690 
bit closer to this end here and it's
easy<00:02:10.600> as<00:02:10.810> just<00:02:10.840> squeezing<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:13.709> the<00:02:14.709> extra<00:02:15.670> of

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
easy as just squeezing it the extra of

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.840 
easy as just squeezing it the extra of
the<00:02:15.850> pin<00:02:16.209> that<00:02:16.360> fell<00:02:16.570> out<00:02:16.750> there<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.850> then

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
the pin that fell out there and then

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.280 
the pin that fell out there and then
what<00:02:19.090> I'm<00:02:19.180> gonna<00:02:19.300> do<00:02:19.570> is<00:02:19.750> I'm<00:02:19.900> going<00:02:20.020> to<00:02:20.080> take

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290 
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:22.949 
what I'm gonna do is I'm going to take
it<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:20.770> pull<00:02:21.250> it<00:02:21.280> down<00:02:21.430> just<00:02:21.820> a<00:02:22.000> little<00:02:22.270> bit<00:02:22.450> to

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
it and pull it down just a little bit to
