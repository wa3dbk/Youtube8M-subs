guitar sound and we all got here is a

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.679 
guitar sound and we all got here is a
style<00:00:27.449> to<00:00:27.900> our<00:00:28.170> Taylor<00:00:28.920> guitar<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.670> this<00:00:30.539> is

style to our Taylor guitar and this is

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.920 
style to our Taylor guitar and this is
quite<00:00:31.080> similar<00:00:31.410> to<00:00:31.560> a<00:00:31.740> one<00:00:32.099> two<00:00:32.430> series<00:00:32.969> Taylor

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930

quite similar to a one two series Taylor
or<00:00:34.410> although<00:00:34.829> although<00:00:35.130> it's<00:00:35.640> slightly

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
different well probably that's the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.959 
different well probably that's the
closest<00:00:39.559> standard<00:00:40.559> Taylor<00:00:40.800> series<00:00:41.070> guitar<00:00:41.610> to

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
then sort of complement it's all really

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.940 
then sort of complement it's all really
nicely<00:01:57.240> in<00:01:57.840> terms<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.350> sound<00:01:58.530> quality<00:01:58.920> of

nicely in terms of the sound quality of

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.490 
nicely in terms of the sound quality of
the<00:01:59.070> wood<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.490> it's<00:02:00.469> got<00:02:01.820> a<00:02:02.820> beautiful<00:02:03.719> big

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
the wood and it's got a beautiful big

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.770 
the wood and it's got a beautiful big
sound<00:02:04.920> so<00:02:05.219> it's<00:02:05.430> a<00:02:05.520> hard<00:02:05.790> wood<00:02:06.119> it<00:02:06.210> resonates

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
sound so it's a hard wood it resonates

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.389 
sound so it's a hard wood it resonates
really<00:02:07.110> really<00:02:07.380> very<00:02:07.500> well<00:02:07.770> but

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
really really very well but

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.460 
really really very well but
with<00:02:09.789> regard<00:02:10.149> to<00:02:10.239> this<00:02:10.420> wood<00:02:10.659> that<00:02:10.899> the<00:02:11.260> high

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
with regard to this wood that the high

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.280 
with regard to this wood that the high
mid<00:02:11.739> frequencies<00:02:12.459> tend<00:02:12.819> to<00:02:13.000> be<00:02:13.180> a<00:02:13.390> little<00:02:14.019> bit

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
mid frequencies tend to be a little bit

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:16.710 
mid frequencies tend to be a little bit
just<00:02:14.920> very<00:02:15.099> slightly<00:02:15.430> scooped<00:02:15.879> out<00:02:16.090> at<00:02:16.390> lower

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
just very slightly scooped out at lower

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.869 
just very slightly scooped out at lower
volume<00:02:17.200> so<00:02:17.409> you<00:02:17.500> get<00:02:17.709> a<00:02:17.739> kind<00:02:17.920> of<00:02:18.010> mellow<00:02:18.340> tone

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:18.879 
volume so you get a kind of mellow tone

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.110 
volume so you get a kind of mellow tone
when<00:02:19.569> the<00:02:19.690> guitars<00:02:20.019> hit<00:02:20.319> hard<00:02:20.650> or<00:02:21.010> plug<00:02:21.760> hard

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
when the guitars hit hard or plug hard

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.960 
when the guitars hit hard or plug hard
you<00:02:22.750> get<00:02:22.900> that<00:02:23.049> springy<00:02:23.620> brightness<00:02:24.519> that<00:02:24.730> you

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
you get that springy brightness that you

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.569 
you get that springy brightness that you
you<00:02:25.299> perhaps<00:02:25.480> would<00:02:25.989> would<00:02:26.530> be<00:02:26.560> more<00:02:27.250> consumed

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:27.579 
you perhaps would would be more consumed

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:30.960 
you perhaps would would be more consumed

within their Darren DAC at top and so

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.990 
within their Darren DAC at top and so
very<00:02:31.690> versatile<00:02:32.489> beautiful<00:02:33.489> sound<00:02:33.790> and

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:05.920 
proper the proper proper stuffing there

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.099 
proper the proper proper stuffing there
even<00:03:06.099> the<00:03:06.190> hidden<00:03:06.430> bits<00:03:06.640> are<00:03:06.879> fantastic<00:03:07.750> and

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:08.109 
even the hidden bits are fantastic and

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:11.130 
even the hidden bits are fantastic and
the<00:03:08.950> top<00:03:09.190> radius<00:03:09.579> is<00:03:09.790> very<00:03:10.390> slightly<00:03:10.750> curved

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
the top radius is very slightly curved

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.770 
the top radius is very slightly curved
so<00:03:11.530> on<00:03:11.890> top<00:03:12.400> very<00:03:12.879> slightly<00:03:13.150> curved<00:03:13.419> like<00:03:13.630> that

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
so on top very slightly curved like that

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.879 
so on top very slightly curved like that
it's<00:03:14.349> 65<00:03:15.250> Fox<00:03:15.970> radius<00:03:16.660> curves<00:03:17.079> so<00:03:17.500> just<00:03:17.799> to

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
it's 65 Fox radius curves so just to

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:19.830 
it's 65 Fox radius curves so just to
explain<00:03:18.280> we've<00:03:18.639> had<00:03:18.760> a<00:03:18.790> circle<00:03:19.599> that<00:03:19.690> has<00:03:19.810> a

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
explain we've had a circle that has a

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.020 
explain we've had a circle that has a
radius<00:03:19.870> of<00:03:20.200> 65<00:03:20.859> feet<00:03:21.130> this<00:03:21.310> would<00:03:21.489> be<00:03:21.609> right<00:03:21.910> on

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
radius of 65 feet this would be right on

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.699 
radius of 65 feet this would be right on
the<00:03:22.150> outer<00:03:22.269> curve<00:03:22.569> this<00:03:22.930> little<00:03:23.200> bit<00:03:23.349> here<00:03:23.380> a

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
the outer curve this little bit here a

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.949 
the outer curve this little bit here a
little<00:03:23.769> very<00:03:24.430> slight<00:03:24.790> curve<00:03:25.120> on<00:03:25.359> that<00:03:25.389> hardly

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
little very slight curve on that hardly

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.759 
little very slight curve on that hardly
perceptible<00:03:26.139> but<00:03:26.680> it<00:03:26.769> is<00:03:26.889> there<00:03:27.160> and<00:03:28.739> you<00:03:29.739> know

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
perceptible but it is there and you know

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.250 
perceptible but it is there and you know
that<00:03:30.310> obviously<00:03:30.690> needs<00:03:31.690> more<00:03:31.900> precision

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
that obviously needs more precision

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:35.849 
that obviously needs more precision
resonance<00:03:33.160> at<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.519> top<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.319> the<00:03:35.319> binding<00:03:35.530> on

the<00:03:36.040> guitar<00:03:36.400> is<00:03:36.690> coca-cola<00:03:37.690> so<00:03:38.470> you<00:03:38.530> get<00:03:38.849> this

00:03:39.839 --> 00:03:39.849 
the guitar is coca-cola so you get this

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:43.860 
the guitar is coca-cola so you get this
lovely<00:03:40.180> red<00:03:41.129> wood<00:03:42.129> and<00:03:42.419> across<00:03:43.419> down<00:03:43.780> the
