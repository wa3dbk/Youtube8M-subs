00:00:09.569 --> 00:00:14.079
 rights are those connected with all the interventions of any specialty 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:19.809
 are not or are they that only start at different naturally there are some 

00:00:19.809 --> 00:00:23.749
 interventions little bit particular can cook the liposuction that evades risks 

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:28.410
 particular connected with this type of intervention but in general we talk about it 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.580
 a risk with me on surgery and sex the act 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.950
 they are connected with the state of the patient with the type of intervention yes 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.819
 with longer doing these interventions these are the things 

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:46.469
 the environment is also fundamental if I make the operating room the clinic of 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.799
 we are a surgical clinic where these interventions come 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.970
 here in security 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.090
 it is a very important thing especially for interventions that are made in 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.550
 absolute election her normally healthy patient 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.670
 patients who undergo plastic surgery because of their particularity 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.180
 aesthetics must be holy patients 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.470
 one for right. decrease the risks associated with intervention 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.090
 and two because we are a pathology first decorated the pathology then could be 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.320
 make an intervention 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.250
 of aesthetic plastic surgery 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.000
 adam 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.840
 itunes is also very important the environment where these interventions are made and there 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.780
 there are few rules that you actually would want to have a regulation that 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.880
 civic where and how these interventions can be made especially in age 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.840
 there are surgical masons where a lot of surgery is done 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.060
 important and therefore with an increased risk and no regulation of the 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.640
 that can somehow give honda 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.630
 a general address to this situation 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.730
 but the most puma scandalous in my opinion 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:58.100
 security about what kind of surgeon does these operations in Italy 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.039
 does not exist 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:00.960
 no rule that says 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.220
 that the specialist plastic surgeon must perform surgery 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.530
 plastic 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.610
 here it deterres you from registering after being done by anyone of any kind 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.539
 I forget as long as I am a doctor 

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:16.649
 connected a check on its preparation no control 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:20.819
 on the fact that he had an expense at the beginning a specialty home now io 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.959
 there are colleagues but above all commercial companies that advertise 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.179
 also deceptive but above all very aggressive 

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:33.119
 is the topic they want to get through the feeling they want to get through 

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.710
 that you can go 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.000
 to get a cosmetic surgery done as you go in the salon of 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.380
 beauty getting in to do a make-up does it do face cleaning of course this 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.359
 it's not true 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:47.669
 and this increases the king 

00:02:47.669 --> 00:02:51.829
 really slaughter risk that these patients can have 

00:02:52.509 --> 00:02:55.989
 what else can you do to look for the whole 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.159
 having bajaur corrected itself therefore of honey risk n'hÃ©sitez intervention 

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.540
 try to have stated that they are dedicated to this type of interventions that 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.259
 be good at doing these interventions 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:12.729
 lower risk the best results because one of the risks also have a 

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:16.179
 result below the result average return 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.629
 so what should we do in italy as it was done in france 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:23.659
 for example the only European country 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.269
 in which there is a regulation that 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.559
 prevents and orders specialists in plastic surgery to operate 

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:34.409
 to perform aesthetic plastic surgery 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:39.079
 we, too, should have had something with me like the French rules 

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:44.569
 make sure they are the only plastic surgery surgeons they create 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:49.579
 hutton trains 35 years old right. to do this kind of cheope either 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.579
 who do cosmetic plastic surgery 

00:03:54.179 --> 00:03:58.029
 the imbecile now there is not this kind of machomai regulation 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:02.509
 necessary in some way the government can somehow begin 

00:04:03.619 --> 00:04:05.809
 interfere altar of the rules 

00:04:05.809 --> 00:04:07.820
 in this environment he did 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:12.279
 a lot with poems there are serious professionals 

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:14.599
 in our society of 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.229
 in the Italian society of reconstructive and aesthetic plastic surgery 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.270
 we insist that shega patients in their orly 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.290
 within the members of the society not as a member of the society but 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:27.940
 because this ensures 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:31.830
 and all members who have had a certain train are specialists in 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.009
 plastic reconstructive and aesthetic surgery at the university 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.389
 what we ask therefore we ground this a moment of safety in the 

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:43.710
 plastic surgery 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.650
 we can ask the government have the same rules as me 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.650
 to myself as codes of self-regulation that has a code 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:56.729
 ethical kenny exists in our specialty but not only in 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.559
 reality exists within the framework of the 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:02.779
 medicine and prevents us from pushing interventions beyond their own 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:04.420
 normal feasibility 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.300
 he asks me useless interventions h the patient only 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:10.249
 porn question of profit 

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:16.279
 and from the government instead we ask for rules the rules are enough 

00:05:16.279 --> 00:05:19.279
 easy to do once one has passed 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.720
 the problem of lobbies because there are many interests connected with these with 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.150
 this type of rieti close down oh finally because it is also tied 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:30.809
 has some interesting earnings 

00:05:30.809 --> 00:05:36.419
 so spiegelman we ask that I sell made a regulation where they are 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.929
 only the specialists who put all these interventions to hand 

00:05:40.929 --> 00:05:45.189
 patients who actually the real thing nothing that affects all patients 

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.969
 are 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:47.039
 protected 

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:51.120
 from interventions riskiness interventions useless from interventions but ago
