00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 all as always welcome in the pupa 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.390
 nail academy this is the nail art that 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.150
 I propose today how you see one 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.920
 in the clean and essential graphic auction e 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.870
 for this reason in art I left myself 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.929
 to inspire precisely from the prints of this 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.760
 collection that mica are so much e 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.449
 so I said why not bring them back 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.520
 on the nails 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.680
 let's see immediately how I made it 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.109
 first applied the multi in 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.949
 kart 7 in 1 which is a base on all 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.439
 my nails must then be spread two passes of the 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:36.300
 gam imat number 0 0 3 which is a 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.219
 beautiful pastel green and the state 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.629
 then the single color on all nails 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.629
 like I said and you go 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.960
 when the nail polish is perfectly 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.320
 dry and help enough 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.149
 quickly just because I am at 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.030
 i take the striding that this sort of 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.979
 very very small adhesive tape e 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.719
 detail some strips I do 

00:00:59.979 --> 00:01:03.750
 stick to the nail as you see from 

00:01:01.719 --> 00:01:03.750
 images 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.730
 then I take a piece of paper 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.700
 silver a short tip brush 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.280
 and thin and I keep the barter close to me 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.950
 it does not raise enamel because with this I will go 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.280
 clean the brush from the color I take the 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.190
 enamel ngam imac in 004 pear colors 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.140
 this beautiful yellow and this 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:48.640
 lilac which is the number 0 0 2 poggio 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.890
 a few drops of nail polish on the paper 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.690
 silver and with the brush I go to 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.550
 fill these geometric figures that 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.550
 they were created by striping 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.990
 I clean the brush obviously between one 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:07.869
 color and the other to make them the plane 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:10.000
 the other time that enamel figure 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.090
 still fresh to remove it 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.920
 striping as you see this alive a 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.410
 outline the geometric figures at 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.870
 perfection a perfection that 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.430
 certainly freehand and I don't say 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.410
 impossible but really hard to 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.370
 get 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.440
 I wait for the figures to be 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.239
 perfectly hired in the ford from 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.640
 oblige again striping 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.500
 form a triangle just like 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.769
 reported by this pack 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.769
 collection 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:41.740
 makes the asx in yellow then for 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.370
 create a contrast effect 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.460
 between then and smart in these gel 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.090
 number 52 from a black I take it with the 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.590
 brush and the triangle must be colored 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.420
 just like before it needs to be removed 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:00.880
 striding when the glaze is still 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:05.440
 fresh and here is a small size 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:08.770
 perfect little triangle that remains 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.590
 then add your own dots 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.150
 like that press the to get them seen 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.920
 which are very small I use it 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.600
 itself hanging from the thin tip that 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.600
 I used to apply colors 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.569
 the finished nail art obviously not 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.069
 need the bill otherwise we will go 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:30.799
 to eliminate this is the little chest 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:32.480
 wonderful and I hope so much there is 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.799
 liked sending me a big kiss and there 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.920
 see you at the next video 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.920
