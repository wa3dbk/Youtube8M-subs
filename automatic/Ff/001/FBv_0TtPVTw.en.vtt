00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.110 
scientist and and really that's what it
is<00:02:35.780> yeah<00:02:36.770> it's<00:02:36.950> a<00:02:37.040> little<00:02:37.250> bit<00:02:37.340> like<00:02:37.490> a<00:02:37.520> neo<00:02:37.940> in

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.550 
is yeah it's a little bit like a neo in
the<00:02:38.150> matrix<00:02:38.240> isn't<00:02:38.780> it<00:02:38.959> everything<00:02:39.260> kind<00:02:39.440> of

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
the matrix isn't it everything kind of

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.290 
the matrix isn't it everything kind of
slows<00:02:39.740> down<00:02:40.010> you<00:02:40.190> see<00:02:40.340> it<00:02:40.459> all<00:02:40.580> coming<00:02:40.819> you

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
slows down you see it all coming you

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.890 
slows down you see it all coming you
know<00:02:41.390> there's<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.810> lot<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.080> folks<00:02:42.290> have<00:02:42.500> said

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
know there's a lot of folks have said

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.270 
know there's a lot of folks have said
especially<00:02:44.560> when<00:02:44.680> it<00:02:44.770> like<00:02:44.980> this<00:02:45.069> was<00:02:45.190> going

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
especially when it like this was going

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.320 
especially when it like this was going
to<00:02:45.340> be<00:02:45.459> announced<00:02:45.640> all<00:02:45.910> it<00:02:46.120> should<00:02:46.239> have

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
to be announced all it should have

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.880 
to be announced all it should have
happened<00:02:46.420> five<00:02:46.750> years<00:02:46.780> ago<00:02:47.170> it's<00:02:47.319> too<00:02:47.500> late<00:02:47.709> it

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
happened five years ago it's too late it

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:48.960 
happened five years ago it's too late it
doesn't<00:02:47.920> matter<00:02:48.280> anymore

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
doesn't matter anymore

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.180 
doesn't matter anymore
this<00:02:49.239> strange<00:02:49.540> way<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:50.170> find<00:02:50.739> this<00:02:50.860> a<00:02:50.920> little

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
this strange way I find this a little

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.830 
this strange way I find this a little
bit<00:02:51.370> more<00:02:51.520> of<00:02:51.610> an<00:02:51.700> interesting<00:02:52.030> fight<00:02:52.599> now

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
bit more of an interesting fight now

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.750 
bit more of an interesting fight now
than<00:02:53.080> it<00:02:53.170> might<00:02:53.290> have<00:02:53.410> been<00:02:53.470> in<00:02:53.620> 2010<00:02:54.340> both

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
than it might have been in 2010 both

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.850 
than it might have been in 2010 both
guys<00:02:55.060> are<00:02:55.480> a<00:02:55.630> little<00:02:56.020> bit<00:02:56.230> diminished<00:02:56.620> leaders

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
guys are a little bit diminished leaders

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.260 
guys are a little bit diminished leaders
actually<00:02:57.010> they're<00:02:57.280> not<00:02:57.310> by<00:02:57.670> this<00:02:57.730> ambition

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
actually they're not by this ambition

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.089 
actually they're not by this ambition
once<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.930> reagents<00:02:59.380> that<00:02:59.410> he<00:02:59.590> said<00:02:59.800> to<00:02:59.830> me<00:02:59.980> you

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
once the reagents that he said to me you

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.670 
once the reagents that he said to me you
expect<00:03:00.780> but<00:03:01.780> at<00:03:01.900> the<00:03:01.989> same<00:03:02.170> time<00:03:02.470> they've

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
expect but at the same time they've

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.830 
expect but at the same time they've
learned<00:03:03.010> more<00:03:03.310> perhaps<00:03:04.239> you're<00:03:04.599> making

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
learned more perhaps you're making

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.839 
learned more perhaps you're making
mistakes<00:03:05.200> in<00:03:05.709> Manny<00:03:05.980> Pacquiao's<00:03:06.370> pace<00:03:06.640> just

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
mistakes in Manny Pacquiao's pace just

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.520 
mistakes in Manny Pacquiao's pace just
from<00:03:07.180> learning<00:03:07.599> in<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.780> pen<00:03:07.959> wait<00:03:08.230> maybe<00:03:08.380> this

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
from learning in the pen wait maybe this

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.440 
from learning in the pen wait maybe this
pace<00:03:08.709> there<00:03:09.099> are<00:03:09.220> lot<00:03:09.370> smarter<00:03:09.700> I<00:03:10.120> think<00:03:10.300> it's

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
pace there are lot smarter I think it's

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.559 
pace there are lot smarter I think it's
going<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:10.690> be<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.840> lot<00:03:11.140> more<00:03:11.730> PG<00:03:12.730> is<00:03:13.060> we're<00:03:13.420> going

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569 
going to be a lot more PG is we're going

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:15.990 
going to be a lot more PG is we're going
to<00:03:13.690> see<00:03:13.930> each<00:03:14.410> guy<00:03:14.739> doing<00:03:15.069> his<00:03:15.160> best<00:03:15.370> to<00:03:15.489> try<00:03:15.970> to

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
what makes it so compelling and really

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.270

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:07.569 
does right I mean he goes in

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:09.659 
does right I mean he goes in
do<00:05:08.259> a<00:05:08.289> little<00:05:08.529> bit<00:05:08.679> of<00:05:08.770> work<00:05:09.159> you'll<00:05:09.490> do<00:05:09.639> a

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:09.669 
do a little bit of work you'll do a

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:12.359 
do a little bit of work you'll do a
little<00:05:09.819> bit<00:05:10.029> of<00:05:10.119> backward<00:05:10.539> I<00:05:10.929> mean<00:05:11.289> yeah<00:05:12.069> let's

00:05:12.359 --> 00:05:12.369 
little bit of backward I mean yeah let's

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:14.100 
little bit of backward I mean yeah let's
be<00:05:12.490> some<00:05:12.669> Tarly<00:05:12.879> honest<00:05:13.179> he<00:05:13.509> could<00:05:13.689> wait<00:05:13.839> to<00:05:13.990> be

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
be some Tarly honest he could wait to be

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.320 
be some Tarly honest he could wait to be
gone<00:05:14.289> and<00:05:14.469> then<00:05:14.559> come<00:05:14.740> back<00:05:14.770> for<00:05:14.969> four<00:05:15.969> hours

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
gone and then come back for four hours

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.719 
gone and then come back for four hours
so<00:05:16.689> I<00:05:17.199> think<00:05:17.499> the<00:05:17.770> bodyguard<00:05:18.309> behind<00:05:18.429> him

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
so I think the bodyguard behind him

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:40.330 
so I think the bodyguard behind him
looks<00:05:18.879> like<00:05:18.939> he<00:05:19.089> goes<00:05:19.270> to<00:05:19.360> the<00:05:19.449> gym

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:40.340 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.400 

so<00:05:41.000> getting<00:05:41.270> up<00:05:41.450> close<00:05:41.630> and<00:05:41.930> personal<00:05:42.380> with

so getting up close and personal with
the<00:05:42.650> champ<00:05:43.210> although<00:05:44.210> I<00:05:44.240> think<00:05:44.360> he<00:05:44.540> liked<00:05:44.930> the

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:44.960 
the champ although I think he liked the

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.710 
the champ although I think he liked the
efforts<00:05:45.920> to<00:05:46.160> move<00:05:46.340> a<00:05:46.520> little<00:05:46.670> bit<00:05:46.880> as<00:05:47.540> he

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:47.720 
efforts to move a little bit as he
