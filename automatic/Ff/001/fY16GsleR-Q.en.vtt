00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
more relevance to the series but to me

noise<00:01:00.600> I<00:01:00.960> think<00:01:01.140> all<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.710> these<00:01:01.859> buildings

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
noise I think all of these buildings

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.709 
noise I think all of these buildings
around<00:01:02.370> here<00:01:02.609> in<00:01:02.969> this<00:01:03.090> village<00:01:03.390> I<00:01:03.510> think

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
around here in this village I think

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.030

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.830 
one thing I will say about this map is
you<00:01:26.040> might<00:01:26.310> need<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.520> fast<00:01:26.850> computer<00:01:27.090> I'm

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
you might need a fast computer I'm

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.270 
you might need a fast computer I'm
actually<00:01:28.200> just<00:01:28.470> running<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.799> on<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> laptop

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
actually just running this on a laptop

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.580 
actually just running this on a laptop
and<00:01:29.759> as<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.240> can<00:01:30.360> see<00:01:30.420> not<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.900> lot<00:01:31.020> of<00:01:31.229> stuff<00:01:31.439> is

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and as you can see not a lot of stuff is

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.230 
and as you can see not a lot of stuff is
spawning<00:01:31.890> I'm<00:01:32.490> running<00:01:32.759> out<00:01:32.880> on<00:01:32.970> fast

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
spawning I'm running out on fast

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.940 
spawning I'm running out on fast
graphics<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.140> maximum<00:01:34.500> render<00:01:34.829> distance

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
graphics and the maximum render distance

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.710 
graphics and the maximum render distance
I<00:01:35.490> mean<00:01:35.759> I<00:01:35.850> would<00:01:36.000> turn<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.299> render<00:01:36.600> distance

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
I mean I would turn the render distance

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.499 
I mean I would turn the render distance
down<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.530> then<00:01:37.680> you'd<00:01:38.340> literally<00:01:38.970> can't<00:01:39.329> see

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
down but then you'd literally can't see

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.210 
down but then you'd literally can't see
anything<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:40.200> there's<00:01:40.619> no<00:01:40.710> point<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.100> that

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
anything so there's no point in that

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.520 
anything so there's no point in that
book<00:01:41.700> my<00:01:42.180> computer<00:01:42.600> can't<00:01:42.810> really<00:01:43.020> run<00:01:43.259> it<00:01:43.380> I

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
book my computer can't really run it I

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.530 
book my computer can't really run it I
mean<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> can<00:01:44.189> but<00:01:44.520> it's<00:01:44.729> not<00:01:44.820> render<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.360> stuff

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
mean a can but it's not render and stuff

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.149 
mean a can but it's not render and stuff
in<00:01:45.659> as<00:01:45.750> quickly<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.049> I'd<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.320> so<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.009> want

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
in as quickly as I'd like so if you want

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:48.710 
in as quickly as I'd like so if you want
to<00:01:47.220> download<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.880> might<00:01:48.030> have<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.540> get<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
to download this you might have to get a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.929 
to download this you might have to get a
fast<00:01:48.990> computer<00:01:49.590> may<00:01:49.950> appear<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.490> have<00:01:50.610> arrived

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
fast computer may appear to have arrived

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.039 
fast computer may appear to have arrived
after<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.689> larva<00:01:52.649> lick<00:01:53.070> this<00:01:53.970> is<00:01:54.210> kind<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.750> weird

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
after a larva lick this is kind of weird

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.870 
after a larva lick this is kind of weird
so<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:55.649> this<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.189> broken<00:01:56.640> bridge

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
so I think this is like a broken bridge

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.639 
so I think this is like a broken bridge
of<00:01:57.119> some<00:01:57.299> kind<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> you<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:58.110> lava<00:01:58.380> lake

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
of some kind of you this is a lava lake

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.550 
of some kind of you this is a lava lake
with<00:01:59.189> black<00:01:59.909> things<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.229> way<00:02:01.350> I

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
with black things going it the way I

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.139 
with black things going it the way I
don't<00:02:01.829> know<00:02:01.979> that<00:02:02.250> might<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> grave<00:02:02.939> or

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
don't know that might be a grave or

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.730 
don't know that might be a grave or
something<00:02:03.450> over<00:02:03.719> there<00:02:03.930> it<00:02:04.229> looks<00:02:04.439> really

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
something over there it looks really

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.020 
something over there it looks really
cool<00:02:04.920> or<00:02:05.159> whatever<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.790> have<00:02:05.939> to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
cool or whatever it is I have to

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.180 
cool or whatever it is I have to
continue<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.509> explore<00:02:06.869> what's<00:02:07.469> this<00:02:07.710> here

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
continue to explore what's this here

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.219 
continue to explore what's this here
bills<00:02:08.429> yeah<00:02:08.849> what<00:02:09.060> here<00:02:09.270> barrels<00:02:09.539> we<00:02:09.599> got<00:02:09.750> Mel

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
bills yeah what here barrels we got Mel

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.550 
bills yeah what here barrels we got Mel
and<00:02:10.370> it<00:02:11.370> looks<00:02:11.580> like<00:02:11.700> we're<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.270> out<00:02:12.750> into

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
and it looks like we're going out into

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.750 
and it looks like we're going out into
the<00:02:13.680> wilderness<00:02:13.830> right<00:02:14.220> now<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.370> don't<00:02:14.519> know<00:02:14.730> if

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
the wilderness right now I don't know if

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.460 
the wilderness right now I don't know if
this<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.000> more<00:02:15.209> of<00:02:15.330> them<00:02:15.480> up<00:02:15.599> but<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.200> does<00:02:16.319> seem

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
this is more of them up but it does seem

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.690 
this is more of them up but it does seem
to<00:02:16.560> be<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.709> path<00:02:16.950> out<00:02:17.099> here<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.430> let's<00:02:17.580> follow

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
to be a path out here so let's follow

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.580 
to be a path out here so let's follow
this<00:02:17.910> path

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.229

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
fields and this place just seems to keep

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.180 
fields and this place just seems to keep

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
going and going and going and it's

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.680 
going and going and going and it's
keeping<00:03:29.430> this<00:03:29.519> kind<00:03:29.730> of<00:03:29.819> textured<00:03:30.209> rough<00:03:30.450> look

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
keeping this kind of textured rough look

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:32.690 
keeping this kind of textured rough look
wherever<00:03:31.049> it<00:03:31.139> goes<00:03:31.319> which<00:03:31.530> really<00:03:31.829> works<00:03:32.100> this

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
wherever it goes which really works this

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.210 
wherever it goes which really works this
is<00:03:32.850> what<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:32.970> mean<00:03:33.209> so<00:03:33.420> you<00:03:33.480> look<00:03:33.660> at<00:03:33.780> this<00:03:33.900> cliff

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
is what I mean so you look at this cliff

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.559 
is what I mean so you look at this cliff
usually<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.579> cliff<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.090> vanilla<00:03:36.359> minecraft

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
usually this cliff in vanilla minecraft

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:38.780 
usually this cliff in vanilla minecraft
would<00:03:37.079> just<00:03:37.290> have<00:03:37.440> stone<00:03:37.980> all<00:03:38.250> the<00:03:38.340> way<00:03:38.430> up<00:03:38.489> or

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
would just have stone all the way up or

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.069 
would just have stone all the way up or
mud<00:03:39.030> all<00:03:39.150> the<00:03:39.269> way<00:03:39.359> up<00:03:39.450> depend<00:03:39.720> on<00:03:39.810> the<00:03:39.900> type<00:03:40.049> of

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
mud all the way up depend on the type of

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.840 
mud all the way up depend on the type of
cliff<00:03:40.350> but<00:03:40.799> they've<00:03:40.950> kind<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:41.250> mixed<00:03:41.579> it<00:03:41.670> up<00:03:41.700> a

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
cliff but they've kind of mixed it up a

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.190 
cliff but they've kind of mixed it up a
bit<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.120> then<00:03:42.239> work<00:03:42.389> with<00:03:42.420> both<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.109> the

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
bit and then work with both and the

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.110 
bit and then work with both and the
balls<00:03:43.470> up<00:03:43.590> are<00:03:43.680> like<00:03:43.799> leaves<00:03:44.370> in<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.760> middle

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
balls up are like leaves in the middle

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.580 
balls up are like leaves in the middle
it<00:03:45.480> just<00:03:45.660> gives<00:03:45.870> it<00:03:45.989> this<00:03:46.079> really<00:03:46.170> nice

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
it just gives it this really nice

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.319 
it just gives it this really nice
textured<00:03:47.069> look<00:03:47.160> it<00:03:47.310> almost<00:03:47.579> looks<00:03:47.850> like<00:03:48.000> it

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
textured look it almost looks like it

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.280 
textured look it almost looks like it
almost<00:03:48.540> looks<00:03:48.720> better<00:03:48.900> than<00:03:49.139> vanilla

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
almost looks better than vanilla

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.650 
almost looks better than vanilla
minecraft<00:03:49.650> but<00:03:50.549> no<00:03:50.670> minecraft<00:03:51.120> could<00:03:51.389> do<00:03:51.540> that

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660 
minecraft but no minecraft could do that

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.120 
minecraft but no minecraft could do that
