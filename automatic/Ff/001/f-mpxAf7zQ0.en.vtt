five nights at freddy's 3 video today I

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.280 
five nights at freddy's 3 video today I
would<00:00:05.730> be<00:00:05.850> talking<00:00:06.180> about<00:00:06.359> an<00:00:06.509> idea<00:00:06.720> that<00:00:07.259> I

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
would be talking about an idea that I

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.379 
would be talking about an idea that I
think<00:00:07.379> would<00:00:07.710> be<00:00:07.830> very<00:00:07.950> cool<00:00:08.250> to<00:00:08.429> see<00:00:08.639> in<00:00:08.880> five

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389

that showcase the box that all the

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.410 
that showcase the box that all the
animatronics<00:00:16.619> parts<00:00:17.250> are<00:00:17.369> in<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.820> props<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
animatronics parts are in the props the

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.390 
animatronics parts are in the props the
masks<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.170> arms<00:00:19.560> you<00:00:19.800> know<00:00:19.920> all<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.250> body

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
masks the arms you know all the body

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.340 
masks the arms you know all the body
parts<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.060> animatronics<00:00:21.630> from<00:00:21.869> five

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
parts of the animatronics from five

parts of the animatronics from five
nights<00:00:22.529> at<00:00:22.619> Freddy's<00:00:22.859> 2<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.699> that's<00:00:24.150> not<00:00:24.330> just

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
nights at Freddy's 2 and that's not just

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.330 
nights at Freddy's 2 and that's not just
the<00:00:24.750> twin<00:00:24.990> electronics<00:00:25.500> but<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.189> also

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
the twin electronics but you can also

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.220 
the twin electronics but you can also
see<00:00:26.609> Foxy's<00:00:27.029> hook<00:00:27.240> but<00:00:27.570> it<00:00:27.660> is<00:00:27.779> actually<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
see Foxy's hook but it is actually the

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.450 
see Foxy's hook but it is actually the
foxy<00:00:28.650> from<00:00:28.830> five<00:00:28.980> nights<00:00:29.160> at<00:00:29.220> Freddy's<00:00:29.429> 2

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
foxy from five nights at Freddy's 2

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.250 
foxy from five nights at Freddy's 2
that's<00:00:29.880> why<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.029> say<00:00:30.300> they<00:00:30.689> offer<00:00:30.869> five<00:00:31.019> minutes

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
that's why I say they offer five minutes

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.920 
that's why I say they offer five minutes
phrase<00:00:31.410> too<00:00:31.619> and<00:00:32.090> basically<00:00:33.090> what<00:00:33.329> happened

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
phrase too and basically what happened

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.750 
phrase too and basically what happened
with<00:00:34.050> this<00:00:34.200> one<00:00:34.469> was<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.829> actually<00:00:35.280> saw<00:00:35.489> it<00:00:35.520> in

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
with this one was you actually saw it in

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.569 
with this one was you actually saw it in
a<00:00:35.850> teaser<00:00:36.090> picture<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.620> title<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.040> what

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
a teaser picture and the title is what

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.709 
a teaser picture and the title is what
can<00:00:38.850> we<00:00:39.059> use<00:00:39.290> also<00:00:40.850> you<00:00:41.850> then<00:00:42.059> find<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.480> in<00:00:42.570> your

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
can we use also you then find it in your

office in the game trailers or as we can

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.560 
office in the game trailers or as we can
see<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.440> game's<00:00:47.280> teaser<00:00:47.670> trailer<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.329> on

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
see in the game's teaser trailer and on

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.020 
see in the game's teaser trailer and on
the<00:00:48.809> steam<00:00:49.050> greenlight<00:00:49.289> page<00:00:49.530> so<00:00:50.399> what<00:00:51.000> is

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
the steam greenlight page so what is

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.450 
the steam greenlight page so what is
this<00:00:51.300> boxes<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.160> significance<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.340> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
this boxes and significance to the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.200 
this boxes and significance to the
storyline<00:00:53.930> um<00:00:55.129> we<00:00:56.129> actually<00:00:56.160> don't<00:00:56.670> know<00:00:56.940> at

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
storyline um we actually don't know at

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.490 
storyline um we actually don't know at
this<00:00:57.360> point<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.750> actually<00:00:58.050> hardly<00:00:58.289> know

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
this point we actually hardly know

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.470 
this point we actually hardly know
barely<00:00:59.340> anything<00:00:59.550> about<00:00:59.879> became<00:01:00.239> at<00:01:00.359> this

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
barely anything about became at this

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.360 
barely anything about became at this
point<00:01:00.750> or<00:01:00.930> its<00:01:01.079> storyline<00:01:01.410> we're<00:01:02.219> just

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
point or its storyline we're just

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.969 
point or its storyline we're just
working<00:01:02.520> off<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:02.969> we<00:01:03.120> got<00:01:03.300> so<00:01:03.570> far<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:03.979> I

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
working off what we got so far but I

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.500 
working off what we got so far but I
just<00:01:05.309> had<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.489> little<00:01:05.580> bit<00:01:05.790> of<00:01:05.850> an<00:01:05.939> idea<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.450> I

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
just had a little bit of an idea that I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.219 
just had a little bit of an idea that I
think<00:01:06.540> would<00:01:06.750> be<00:01:06.869> really<00:01:06.900> cool<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.320> see<00:01:07.790> and

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
think would be really cool to see and

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.210 
think would be really cool to see and
you<00:01:10.229> know<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.380> little<00:01:10.560> bit<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.799> evidence<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
you know a little bit of evidence to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.210 
you know a little bit of evidence to
kind<00:01:11.580> of<00:01:11.670> partially<00:01:12.510> make<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.810> theory<00:01:13.220> but

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
kind of partially make it a theory but

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.950 
kind of partially make it a theory but
what<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.640> was<00:01:14.790> thinking<00:01:15.150> would<00:01:15.330> be<00:01:15.420> cool<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.930> if

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
what I was thinking would be cool is if

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.200 
what I was thinking would be cool is if
like<00:01:16.439> I<00:01:16.799> know<00:01:17.400> I've<00:01:17.580> seen<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.759> lot<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:17.970> people

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
like I know I've seen a lot of people

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.700 
like I know I've seen a lot of people
talk<00:01:18.540> about<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:18.930> like<00:01:19.259> how<00:01:19.439> there's<00:01:19.619> gonna

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
talk about this like how there's gonna

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.260 
talk about this like how there's gonna
be<00:01:19.799> more<00:01:19.920> animatronics<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.909> this<00:01:21.119> could

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
be more animatronics and that this could

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.179 
be more animatronics and that this could
possibly<00:01:21.420> be<00:01:21.659> why<00:01:21.990> but<00:01:22.560> I<00:01:22.590> think<00:01:22.890> that<00:01:23.100> it

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
possibly be why but I think that it

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.039 
possibly be why but I think that it
would<00:01:23.250> be<00:01:23.340> really<00:01:23.520> cool<00:01:23.850> another<00:01:24.479> way<00:01:24.720> they

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
would be really cool another way they

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.630 
would be really cool another way they
can<00:01:25.200> implement<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.799> or<00:01:25.979> how<00:01:26.100> Scott<00:01:26.400> can<00:01:26.610> make

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
can implement this or how Scott can make

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.880 
can implement this or how Scott can make
this<00:01:26.909> actually<00:01:27.299> work<00:01:27.540> out<00:01:27.659> smoothly<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.350> that

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
this actually work out smoothly is that

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.480 
this actually work out smoothly is that
every<00:01:29.490> every<00:01:30.270> night<00:01:30.509> there<00:01:31.229> is<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.530> few<00:01:32.189> parts

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
every every night there is a few parts

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.420 
every every night there is a few parts
missing<00:01:32.700> from<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.150> box<00:01:33.180> and<00:01:34.070> later<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
missing from the box and later on in the

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:36.980 
missing from the box and later on in the
night<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.640> discover<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.299> it's<00:01:36.479> actually<00:01:36.900> an

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
night you discover that it's actually an

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.289 
night you discover that it's actually an
animatronic<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.680> was<00:01:37.799> built<00:01:38.299> overnight

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
animatronic that was built overnight

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.030 
animatronic that was built overnight
with<00:01:39.930> some<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.439> parts<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.740> were<00:01:40.890> in<00:01:41.009> that

with some of the parts that were in that
box<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.790> put<00:01:42.329> back<00:01:42.479> together<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:43.079> in<00:01:43.500> a

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560

certain<00:01:43.740> way<00:01:43.860> or<00:01:43.979> something<00:01:44.340> like<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.490> and

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:44.850 
certain way or something like that and

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.940 
certain way or something like that and
then<00:01:45.390> also<00:01:45.540> need<00:01:45.840> to<00:01:45.930> see<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.170> random<00:01:46.680> I

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
then also need to see this random I

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.590 
then also need to see this random I
animatronic<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.909> no<00:01:48.090> idea<00:01:48.390> what's

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
animatronic you have no idea what's

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.330 
animatronic you have no idea what's
actually<00:01:48.720> there<00:01:48.960> walking<00:01:49.770> around<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> place

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
actually there walking around the place

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.850 
actually there walking around the place
I<00:01:50.520> think<00:01:50.700> that'd<00:01:50.790> be<00:01:50.909> so<00:01:51.619> scary<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.829> really

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
I think that'd be so scary and really

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.429 
I think that'd be so scary and really
cool<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.399> guess<00:01:53.820> because<00:01:54.180> imagine<00:01:54.840> this<00:01:55.170> you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
cool I guess because imagine this you

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.810 
cool I guess because imagine this you
you<00:01:55.710> do<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.130> first<00:01:56.310> night<00:01:56.520> you're<00:01:56.610> like<00:01:56.640> oh

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.999 
you do the first night you're like oh
one<00:01:57.090> animatronic<00:01:57.540> no<00:01:57.689> big<00:01:57.869> deal<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.649> start<00:01:58.920> up

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
one animatronic no big deal you start up

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.109 
one animatronic no big deal you start up
the<00:01:59.070> next<00:01:59.310> game<00:01:59.460> there<00:01:59.729> are<00:01:59.790> parts<00:02:00.060> missing

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
the next game there are parts missing

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.240 
the next game there are parts missing
from<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> box<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:01.020> you're<00:02:01.140> like<00:02:01.290> oh<00:02:01.500> no<00:02:02.009> what

like a toy Bonnie / chica with you know

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:08.930 
like a toy Bonnie / chica with you know
hands<00:02:07.140> from<00:02:07.409> balloon<00:02:07.799> boy<00:02:08.039> or<00:02:08.310> something<00:02:08.849> like

hands from balloon boy or something like

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.449 
hands from balloon boy or something like
that<00:02:09.000> just<00:02:09.209> do<00:02:09.929> some<00:02:10.170> crazy<00:02:10.440> like<00:02:10.800> mashed<00:02:11.160> up

together

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
together

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.369 
together
animatronic<00:02:13.099> like<00:02:13.810> and<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:15.049> think<00:02:15.260> it'd<00:02:15.349> be

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
animatronic like and I think it'd be

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:18.399 
animatronic like and I think it'd be
cool<00:02:15.590> and<00:02:15.920> also<00:02:16.280> could<00:02:16.760> possibly<00:02:17.269> relate<00:02:18.049> to

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:18.409 
cool and also could possibly relate to

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:21.399 
cool and also could possibly relate to
what<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.430> pictures<00:02:19.819> name<00:02:20.120> is<00:02:20.360> when<00:02:21.319> you

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.539 
actually had it as a teaser picture the
box<00:02:26.569> itself<00:02:26.750> you<00:02:27.170> guys<00:02:27.290> remember<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.799> the

picture was actually titled what can we

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.990 
picture was actually titled what can we
use<00:02:30.140> so<00:02:30.620> this<00:02:30.739> could<00:02:30.860> also<00:02:31.040> possibly<00:02:31.340> relate

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.289 
build a new animatronic or something or
it<00:02:39.709> could<00:02:39.829> also<00:02:39.950> be<00:02:40.099> the<00:02:40.790> people<00:02:41.090> who<00:02:41.120> are

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
I don't know I think it would just be a

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.490 
I don't know I think it would just be a
cool<00:02:47.239> idea<00:02:47.329> to<00:02:47.540> see<00:02:47.780> that<00:02:47.959> like<00:02:48.109> all<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.379> all

of sudden these random part just go

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.699 
of sudden these random part just go
missing<00:02:50.480> and<00:02:50.690> I<00:02:50.780> think<00:02:51.470> it'd<00:02:51.560> be<00:02:51.590> really

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
missing and I think it'd be really

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:53.800 
missing and I think it'd be really
creepy<00:02:52.099> and<00:02:52.730> you<00:02:52.819> see<00:02:53.060> a<00:02:53.090> new<00:02:53.269> animatronic
