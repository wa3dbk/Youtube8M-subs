00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.410
 tinted painting the fence will help 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:08.560
 preserve stingray protect it from the sun and 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.570
 climatic damage before starting to 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.330
 paint must perform all the tasks 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.109
 of preparation necessary to achieve a 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.570
 satisfactory result remove or cover 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.089
 all the objects that surround the fence and 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.189
 you do not want to paint repair the fence 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.919
 if it is damaged and the candle with a 

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.409
 water washer after preparing the 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:31.689
 surface that you do not want to paint cover the 

00:00:29.409 --> 00:00:35.020
 surfaces that you will not paint with a tarp 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:38.200
 or plastic sheet or use a 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.360
 protective screen when spraying avoid 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.930
 perform this work on windy days 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:46.800
 since it can be difficult 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:49.590
 control the spray 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.440
 When using the sprayer make sure 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.989
 to comply with all procedures 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.120
 of security and the user manual and 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.870
 safety instructions before 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.699
 use the sprayer select the 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.190
 spray nozzle to which best suits 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.460
 to the materials you use and the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.800
 surface you want to paint generally 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.869
 the best way to control work 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.690
 is to use a spray pattern 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.300
 narrower for example from 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:20.729
 approximately 8 inches wide and 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:25.679
 a mouthpiece with a smaller hole 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.630
 for example 0.013 inches make sure 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.759
 that the size of the hole in the 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.330
 nozzle does not exceed the maximum capacity 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.160
 of the sprayer 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.590
 when spraying with more materials 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.540
 light as dyes selection the 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.870
 Lower pressure setting to maintain 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.140
 a good spray pattern of this 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.170
 way you can achieve better control and a 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.020
 more neat finish apply the paint or 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.610
 the painting on each table 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.130
 longitudinally following the vein of 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.980
 the wood when I paint the side of the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.220
 near that has supports or poles 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:03.110
 start by painting the supports or poles 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.500
 first point the nozzle directly 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.840
 to interior or exterior angles and 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.540
 then paint the flat surfaces 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:14.090
 when finished paint the tables 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.520
 longitudinally following the vein of 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.650
 the wood and remember to point the nozzle 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.900
 so that it does not cover the edge of the 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.950
 previous pattern so that the passes of 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.330
 overlap by 50% do not forget to use 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.090
 a protective screen when spraying 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.459
 over the top of the fence 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.340
 unless there are no areas where 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:37.280
 Splashing can cause problems 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.110
 if you must paint on a windy day to 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.660
 prevent the sprayed material from flying 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.209
 and splash the narrow part of the pattern 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.819
 of spray must be in the same 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:48.260
 direction that the wind is possible that 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.720
 must apply the paint in a way 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.220
 horizontal or vertical according to 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.830
 orientation of the last pattern of 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.230
 spraying once the 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.330
 I hope that the painting will be 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.489
 dry remove the tapes or films that 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:05.980
 used to protect the surfaces 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.980
 I did not want to paint and clean
