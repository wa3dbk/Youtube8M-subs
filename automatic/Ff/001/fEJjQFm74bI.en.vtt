00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
he spawns which means he has a

because<00:05:36.780> i<00:05:36.930> was<00:05:37.110> that<00:05:37.650> was<00:05:37.800> he<00:05:38.010> didn't<00:05:38.190> get<00:05:38.280> the

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
because i was that was he didn't get the

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.640 
because i was that was he didn't get the
last<00:05:38.520> hit<00:05:38.789> he<00:05:39.030> was<00:05:39.180> just<00:05:39.300> dragged<00:05:39.630> down<00:05:39.840> i<00:05:40.139> was

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
think we both have matches okay so

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:47.790 
think we both have matches okay so
