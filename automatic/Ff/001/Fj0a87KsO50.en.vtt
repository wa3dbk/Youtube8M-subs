00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.369
 sterilization by autoclaves 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.830
 as per saturated is the universal method 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:17.390
 most used applicable to all those 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:18.950
 items that can withstand the heat and 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.869
 moisture are excellent tools 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:22.430
 of sterilization that reach in little 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.250
 weather temperatures higher than the 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:28.369
 boiling water support a system 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.990
 Pressure tightness its function consists 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.759
 in steam generation which 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.980
 penetrates the sterilization chamber and 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.420
 reaches the indicated pressure 'toad' is 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.360
 condenses by contact with materials 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.589
 cold that condensation releases heat 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.690
 moistening and heating 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:43.460
 simultaneously each material until the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.890
 temperature level set where 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.480
 will settle the bacteria of the material 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.550
 We have the validation certificate 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.980
 for the autoclave that includes your number 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.590
 of certificate and the result of the 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.910
 valuation where we specify if it happens or 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.070
 it does not pass depending on the criterion of 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.120
 manufacturer and what the standard tells us 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.540
 that we choose to perform 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.010
 validation 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.410
 where we also have the data of 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.360
 equipment under the description of the 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:12.730
 validation we perform several tests 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:14.410
 under the ISO 17 665 standard of 2009 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:17.620
 with which we perform the tests of 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:20.200
 qualification of the installation and how 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.040
 operation qualification and rating 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.040
 of performance pq 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.740
 premium the people who run and the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.740
 group they review 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.350
 we have information equipment 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.250
 pattern which are the high sensors 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.440
 temperature 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.150
 one tries I achieved mega frame and a sensor 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.940
 high pressure totally the same 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.280
 manufacturer where everyone has a 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.260
 identification number that stops 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.060
 ease of verification we have 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.840
 used a letter to assign the 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.840
 each one of them 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.210
 the sensors are located inside the 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.119
 autoclave chamber in such a way that 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.090
 are distributed for a measurement of 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:04.429
 the temperature and the pressure 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.179
 the installation qualification and how it 

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:07.429
 based on a series of tests 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:10.069
 qualitative and quantitative of both the 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:12.650
 equipment as of the infrastructure where 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.080
 we make poster chassis home with 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.239
 doubles and switches valves and 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.879
 will result let's say the of the estate with 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.530
 of the middle walls and the media 

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:24.940
 of vapor extraction product of the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.940
 strong water among others 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.240
 the qualification of the operation oq 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.950
 we perform a cycle without load where 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.560
 we have a programmed temperature of 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:50.190
 123 degrees Celsius and we expect a 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.110
 pressure of 218 29 bars 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.790
 we take that pressure from a table of 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.290
 thermodynamics 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.620
 for temperature calibration 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:02.010
 we take the selected point and in each 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:04.200
 sensor we take the minimum temperature and 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.870
 the maximum temperature when we want the 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.630
 average the coverage factor and so 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.330
 we take out that expanded uncertainty 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.860
 We have your qualification criteria 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.070
 what are the tolerance and temperature 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.510
 according to ISO tolerance and the 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.320
 temperature according to what the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.320
 criterion of manufacturer 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.349
 Gray 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.799
 after removing the data from the data 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.859
 logger we get a graph like this 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.959
 where we cut the scale so that we can 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:47.579
 take spam from the point of 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:49.950
 maintenance where the temperature 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.490
 stabilize we know we have the first 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.100
 point 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:57.540
 and we organize the scale to get the 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.540
 end point of spam 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.580
 we use these data 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.360
 for our average and 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.360
 uncertainty type a 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.170
 where according to the range we have 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.620
 specified we take the points of 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.540
 measurement 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.380
 to be able to calculate I sat man 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.820
 then we shortened the scale a bit more 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.800
 to get at those maximum points and 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.320
 minimum temperature and on the tab 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.190
 of summary we can see that the program 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.190
 he himself gives us his data 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.190
 the same for pressure points 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.960
 where by the pressure chart that 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:37.849
 we have got the minimum pressure of 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.680
 the maximum pressure and the points of 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:41.310
 pressure to get our 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.840
 average 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.000
 Now we have the qualification of 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.550
 performance pq which is the study of the 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.410
 reproducibility where we use several 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.390
 sterilization cycles followed with a 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:53.250
 maximum load number 

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:55.640
 the programmed temperature and position 

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.640
 expected 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:04.270
 we do with this calibration point 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:06.039
 of temperature the two cycles and 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.650
 we get the minimum temperature the 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:10.509
 maximum temperature best average the 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.639
 coverage factor and uncertainty 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:14.259
 for each of these funds the same 

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:17.229
 procedure we do for the 

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:18.610
 temperature sensors that we have this 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.820
 in order to see the behavior of the 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.470
 autoclave when it is at the top of the load and 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:26.199
 several cycles are done in a row that is 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:29.220
 to look at its performance over time 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:30.990
 when they are used several times in a row 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.660
 we perform the same procedure as 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.340
 we use in qualification oq to 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.310
 get the temperature data 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:41.810
 maximum and minimum but with the cycles of 

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.810
 the qualification pq 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.230
 ah 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.100
 is strong 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.180
 there 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:27.400
 I'm afraid not 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.139
 how not 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:41.249
 finally we have the recommendations 

00:06:39.299 --> 00:06:42.359
 that we give to the user in case the 

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:44.320
 validation does not meet the criteria 

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:45.820
 stipulated 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.500
 annex the validation certificate 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:50.230
 we deliver the composite graph in the 

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.150
 temperature where are the graphs of 

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:54.190
 every place where we can see the 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.900
 behavior in each of the points 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:57.010
 that the temperature of the camera was measured 

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.280
 of the autoclave while it is in 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.280
 functioning 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.680
 here 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:15.860
