00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:12.650
 Hello everyone, today decided to show 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:15.540
 you a video about pillows 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:20.390
 engine mount engine pillows 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:24.210
 engine he came to me man 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.000
 customer repair the car at the same time 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.539
 says look 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.809
 my pillow says pillows and one and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:39.750
 second here 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:44.879
 cracked if visible crack crack 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:49.320
 very small well, that is absolutely it 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:54.989
 not dangerous but he was already afraid he was 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:57.960
 the situation broke the pillow engine 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:02.789
 danced walking under the hood gas pedal 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.189
 wedged since he is not quite experienced in 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:10.200
 these affairs 

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:13.740
 the same fears he said he climbed under the car 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.790
 saw such cracks 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.790
 decided to change 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:26.770
 bought a new cushion put in one but 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:31.210
 it was a secondary work I got 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:36.520
 then took a pillow in the trunk of him took 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:39.030
 immediately with a new type of a cushion well as the 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.030
 pillow 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:57.950
 immediately than not liked me by weight she 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:02:06.020
 different light this pillow well heavier 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:13.940
 I have a sensation later that 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:16.130
 I liked casting something like when 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:23.600
 Soviet Union first cooperatives 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:26.720
 opened tires sticking such 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:35.510
 the impression that they did and those times 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:37.940
 when the tires on the brew whether Tipo Tipo 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:42.580
 Here is such in such she here well state 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.240
 rubber nothing whole all rubber art 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:48.650
 hairpin look what 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:55.060
 the impression that they did not have time 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:03:00.940
 cut or did not want oh well 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:00.940
 I think let's look at what's inside 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:16.990
 kilometer back to open and 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:29.170
 now unscrew 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.170
 take a little key to everyone 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.500
 will go 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.680
 the impression that you're carving 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:45.780
 painted over I don't know where he is where he took them 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:49.420
 didn't call him didn't say anything yet 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:55.180
 like he always took parts from 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:04:03.719
 proven people so there still 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:03.719
 the problem with the nut is that for some reason we 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:23.820
 and there's also a thread problem on 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:23.820
 hairpin i.e. full set 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:34.020
 so I went to unbind her 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.950
 to me 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:47.370
 hairpin trim threads on it below 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:51.490
 no, as it turned out with this side of us 

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:59.040
 seems to be the order of the sounds unscrew well 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:59.040
 We look that at us inside at us it is empty 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.520
 inside we are empty so I will not be long 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:14.010
 tell showing immediately what we have 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:20.800
 must be inside it can not be heard 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:25.750
 sound and dangling bump can 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:30.340
 hear i think he's here judging by 

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:37.470
 the weight sure is because the springs 

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:42.550
 rests now look here this 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:48.990
 prop pillow which was already on 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:56.550
 rusty and that bump barrel rubber 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:06:01.600
 so this should be included 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:03.490
 engine mount assembly do not know sell 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:07.630
 them so separately now or not but unlikely 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:10.990
 Do you most likely collect collecting but we 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:14.140
 we can even if we have this part ourselves 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.020
 whole rubber here are my softy whole people 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.310
 I can tear it all together 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.310
 put the court 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.880
 but the point is not how it will be 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:32.420
 walk 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:34.460
 rubber itself is this part if it 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:37.580
 got such a quality inside 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:40.610
 empty here the problems we have with a stud 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:48.020
 appeared in peretas cut that is 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:56.150
 I donâ€™t even have no food 

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:58.480
 no marking on these but this and here 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.480
 there is 

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:09.220
 2101 catalog number 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:12.290
 this is what i have 

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:15.710
 before installing even burrows and 

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:19.100
 where you buy it all you can 

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:23.420
 recheck in order not to run then 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:26.110
 change not look for the ends here such we 

00:07:23.420 --> 00:07:35.300
 parts are coming now 

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:40.700
 it's all possible to collect and court but judging by 

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:42.820
 the beginning of the video I would have a pillow tour 

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:42.820
 to put 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:50.230
