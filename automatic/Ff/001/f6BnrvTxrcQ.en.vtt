 let's see how convenient such 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.430
 form factor and does it give an advantage on 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.199
 practice 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.780
 complete set of the platform is not in addition

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.929
 looks like one device probably 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.639
 due to the fact that the smartphone is made and 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:56.769
 tablet in the same style 

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:58.780
