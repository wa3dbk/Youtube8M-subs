and it's been a busy day and you want to go
home

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000

concentration

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
so don't yabber on the phone not even hands
free

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.200

you lose your licence then we're all on the
bus

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.500
'cos if you ever hit a car well its gonna be
bad cos you fly through the air

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:47.000
and say hi to your Dad if you're a little bit
small and you're four foot nine

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.599
wear a booster seat and you're gonna be fine

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.799

past

you're going too fast

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.000
remembering these simple rules

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.500
