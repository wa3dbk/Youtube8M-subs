him<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:14.860> removed<00:02:15.520> him<00:02:15.760> from<00:02:15.790> all<00:02:16.090> team

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
him and removed him from all team

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.120 
him and removed him from all team
activities<00:02:16.840> and<00:02:17.110> I<00:02:17.470> think<00:02:17.500> for<00:02:17.830> him<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:18.040> was

very<00:02:18.340> very<00:02:18.490> difficult

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
being in college I think that they can

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.219 
being in college I think that they can
see<00:04:26.160> that<00:04:26.910> a<00:04:26.940> lot<00:04:27.120> of<00:04:27.150> times<00:04:27.450> less<00:04:27.810> of<00:04:27.990> myself

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
is more for the group and because of

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.800 
is more for the group and because of
that<00:04:31.919> senior<00:04:32.430> leadership<00:04:32.820> the<00:04:33.390> Florida
