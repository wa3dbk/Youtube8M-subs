 You can significantly increase the budget for 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.440
 oil production account new forms 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.200
 cooperation in this industry today 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.580
 the presidents of the two countries will look 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.650
 Kazakhstan and Russia Vladimir Putin

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.020
 Nazarbayev there are 11 forum 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.779
 interregional cooperation and for 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.250
 meetings are watched by our correspondent 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.180
 konstantin koveshnikov he goes with 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.220
 we are directly connected 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.380
 Konstantin Hello tell me 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.599
 key meeting issues are already known 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.260
 and how are the participants going 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:35.040

 key questions of course known as 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.829
 expected to be the main topic of the meeting 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.160
 Presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.289
 Vladimir Putin Nursultan Nazarbayev 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.480
 will be innovations in the hydrocarbon sector 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.430
 as it is officially stated more simply 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.260
 the leaders of the two countries will discuss 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.280
 joint development of oil 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.320
 deposits 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.600
 on the eve of the presidents of Russia and Kazakhstan 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.030
 met in Astrakhan and already from there 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.190
 they moved here wiped that 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.910
 tacitly considered the oil capital 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.799
 republics 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.869
 before this city was on the shore 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.380
 Caspian Sea but for a few 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.540
 centuries 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.549
 this sea has become shallower and now 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.010
 almost at a distance of 30 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.200
 kilometers from the borders of the city of Atyrau 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.659
 however, the reserves of kospi from this are not less 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.000
 have become in particular here almost by the side 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.680
 is the legendary kashagan of one of 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.500
 largest oil fields not 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.270
 only in kazakhstan but in the world so far 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.520
 pore his development has been serious 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.650
 difficult almost 5 months a year 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.049
 the Caspian Sea covers a thick layer 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.970
 ice in the oil itself which lies on 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.159
 its bottom is quite large 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.110
 the amount of hydrogen sulfide and other impurities 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.680
 from which there is no mining from here yet 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.960
 is coming 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.880
 clean up however all this is nonsense 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.140
 compared to the amount of oil that 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.710
 here lies 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.330
 Kazakhstan is considered one of the oldest 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.180
 oil-producing countries have 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.340
 to make peace here began at the end of 19 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.440
 century that is much earlier than in Iran 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.420
 Kuwait say Saudi Arabia which 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.190
 Today are considered the main suppliers 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.410
 oil to world markets 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.870
 Russia's interests in this project are related to 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.850
 the fact that so far Russia has performed in 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:09.920
 as the main transit country of Kazakhstan 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.510
 Kazakh oil to foreign markets 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.100
 Well, and now returning to the form 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.590
 regional cooperation which 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.300
 will start here was wiping from the minute 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:20.150
 the minute is to say that they spend it 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.800
 already 11 times and as a place 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.280
 holding this meeting traditionally 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.910
 choose 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.200
 not capital cities but let's say 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.910
 the outback of Russia and Kazakhstan in order 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.070
 so businessmen from both countries can 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.810
 take a closer look at the developments 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.790
 each other such meetings already 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.620
 held in Chelyabinsk in Novosibirsk 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.390
 Aktobe Ust-Kamenogorsk many 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.490
 other cities today this meeting 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.260
 as we have said passes in Atyrau 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.600
 which is tacitly considered petroleum 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.959
 the capital of Kazakhstan, we have prepared 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.180
 A little help about this city Atyrau 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.670
 city ​​at the junction of two continents and 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.190
 several historical eras the Ural River 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.530
 the border between Europe and Asia and 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.410
 the history of the city is divided into Soviet dot 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.300
 and present after the composition of Tsarist Russia 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.160
 and then the Soviet Union this city 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.350
 bore the name of Guryev in honor 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.180
 Astrakhan merchant who first and 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.910
 mastered these lands about their modern 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.190
 Atyrau name translated logon it 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.630
 gained since independence 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.370
 Kazakhstan, however, the main classes 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.530
 few locals since 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.480
 changed in Atyrau for centuries engaged 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.480
 fishing and refining oil 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.459
 The largest enterprises of the city of Atyrau 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.200
 oil refinery and raw materials 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.599
 which comes here from nearby 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.700
 Mangyshlak and Aktobe produce here 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.500
 gasoline for which they drive even from Russia 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.540
 its production process is not fast 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.459
 involves several stages in 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.379
 beginning in huge furnaces the size of 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.359
 the middle five-story building is heated to 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.250
 temperature three hundred eighty five 

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.109
 degrees centigrade so that later 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.879
 divide into fractions let on 

00:03:48.109 --> 00:03:51.709
 further purification from harmful to 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.519
 ecology impurities no one 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:58.459
 described we can complain made up and 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.269
 there was no mechanical impurities of salt and 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:00.799
 water 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:02.930
 a few years ago at the factory 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.909
 built with the end of the great 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.750
 patriotic war produced a massive 

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:07.669
 reconstruction 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.590
 and in the near future they will start here 

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:11.930
 fuel more modern 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.760
 ecological class euro-4 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.039
 show here show this 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.410
 installation designed by the American 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:20.750
 technology by the hands of Japanese engineers 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.910
 using this setup which is now 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.620
 you see behind my back here let out 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.120
 low temperature diesel fuel 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.220
 congelation 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:30.949
 if the normal version freezes already at 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.349
 -5 degrees Celsius then produced 

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:34.130
 here diesel fuel is able to work even in 

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:36.680
 severe frosts 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.230
 we start fractional 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.660
 a lot of us should be shelter we have a degree 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.640
 temperature is temperature here at all 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.590
 one of the key concepts of stitin 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:48.510
 worn like a small child and 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.580
 trying to stick him a thermometer 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.230
 to make the necessary diagnosis is suitable 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.840
 gasoline for use in engines 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.610
 or not if the temperature is 30 gasoline 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.710
 It begins to evaporate it's okay 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.600
 my conclusion is a lab assistant 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.760
 can we beat it 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.470
 proceed to the water procedures considered 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.900
 the number of drops released by 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:11.260
 evaporation of fuel that drops count for 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:14.630
 10 seconds should drop 20 25 drops or 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:17.510
 minute to dig dig 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:19.250

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.160
 the longest pedestrian bridge in Eurasia 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.410
 about half a kilometer long 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.210

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.710
 cooperation between countries has grown 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.580
 almost 6 times and today exceeds 26 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.830

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.230
