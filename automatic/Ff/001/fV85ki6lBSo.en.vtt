 I'm waiting for them and well while 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.000
 both the time of anger to be able to 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:40.860
 keep saying no good girls is the 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.160
 first opportunity that you're going to measure 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.719
 in a ring in this 2012 year that 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.300
 feels like fighting in the federation 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.370
 argentina box and being the first 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.289
 woman that you are going to fight for a title 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.149
 of the world defending your title and not 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.500
 only women the first time 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.940
 a title of the world is disputed that 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.030
 feel the truth that I am more than happy 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.820
 in his 20 area of ​​the federation and I here 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.379
 I made the first amateur fight the 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.700
 box operation the first fight 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.320
 feminine 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.030
 out the first single champion 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.009
 Pan-American in exploration so 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.469
 it has a lot of history this for me as 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.840
 professional had never fought and now 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:17.399
 to fight for and defending my crown 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.110
 what else can I ask or am I 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:21.149
 reassure with my people that you can see me 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.399
 and it's going to be in Neuquén in the end it did not happen 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:24.810
 and well today we are here and there is always 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:26.700
 bad that good does not come 'not always 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.969
 always predisposed to leave everything 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.590
 well you have a lot of bread and a lot of shooting 

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:34.170
 have fought with Mexican boxers 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.149
 what do you know about anabel ortiz and if you had 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.429
 the chance to see her fight good 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:41.459
 danced to give the fight I could not or is not 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.590
 I had a lot of video I could not get out but I saw 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.720
 a training I saw that is a little more 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.579
 slow and that already favored me that 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.799
 he always lost the category below in 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.939
 the minimum also that was champion 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:55.289
 juvenile of the advice of the cmb and good I know 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.140
 that is going to be a pretty challenger 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:02:00.270
 strong is already Mexican that's enough for me 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.119
 I had a lot of experience with Mexicans that 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.770
 they did the battles to me so nothing 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.739
 what do I know I 'm well prepared or you know 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.060
 that I train for this and I love and I 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:11.970
 like to enjoy 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.500
 and sport so good a kind of 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.860
 boxing for the people that came to me supporting 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.620
 in fact they have three rivals in common and 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.720
 Yesenia Martinez Castrejon who 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.819
 you fought in the moon park and won him 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.769
 very well after your rival I think that 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.959
 estimated the most difficult in Montevideo 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.450
 ibeth zamora silva with whom she lost 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.700
 yes yes and also fought with karina 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.670
 Brown 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.410
 but at the beginning of last year good 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.900
 had a nice experience but with 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.120
 rivals that fought with me so 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.519
 I think it's going to be a nice fight because 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.910
 she's a strong woman so that's what 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.819
 that we want beyond this fight the 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.980
 last year at the start program you're going 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.099
 have six or seven fights during the 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.140
 2011 and the concrete ones of this year with 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:59.540
 you project and this year we will see if 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.450
 can show the Japanese naomi 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.890
 togashi to stay with the cmb that does not 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.870
 they fight susi kentikian their next and to the 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.060
 just lost but good is the 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:11.510
 emv I know it's going to a capable rematch 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:13.459
 with the girl who lost with more morrón and 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.170
 good that wins will be good 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.230
 because if a non-member league wants 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.269
 say that but I do not know if the 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:22.489
 I saw something strange happening there I did not see it 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.190
 lose how they gave you very loss 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.290
 closed and more in his house was very rare what 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.660
 what happened but good sum because 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.510
 the Yankee also appeared 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.700
 of more morrón list so it's good 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.370
 then this saying that opening things 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.290
 open by opening more challengers obviously 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.480
 not in my category but what is based 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.060
 in my category I will try to be able 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.580
 bring the Japanese and complete me in it 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.890
 with the cmb and be the champion of the three 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.180
 Crowns did not say it at the beginning of the 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.950
 transmission I consider that that is the 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.770
 best Argentine boxer the best 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.370
 champion later back maybe erika 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.440
 farías 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.630
 jessica bitters above all her last 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:01.490
 performance and the bunch of the many 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.569
 champions that Argentina has you 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.569
 I really felt that way 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.430
 obviously with accompanied with anabella 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:10.349
 Farias and seven consolidating cameras 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.700
 after taking the curia obviously 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.170
 that will attend you again the 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.670
 we receive with open arms as 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.560
 marcela can come and go to do what 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.709
 want I knew I was not going to leave 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:22.349
 because he loves it and is good too 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:25.139
 I prefer a thousand times to marcela to follow 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:26.669
 with us that good and nothing the truth 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:28.620
 who is happy that boxing 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.710
 female keeps growing girls 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:33.289
 they went to be in the Olympics for the 

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.250
 female boxing that is very important 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:38.820
 we keep growing we keep working 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.259
 with this so I hope we continue 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.780
 growing and there is still a good level 

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:44.340
 is what we most want the last two 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.800
 taking a little out of this fight 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.440
 really the one named is to love the curia 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.780
 how you saw her in her return but well 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:53.130
 well life and well very safe of what 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.420
 she wanted to do she has a 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:59.070
 mother experience so the truth that 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:01.260
 in that sense I was calm more 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:03.390
 knowing that with the rival he had already 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.700
 I had fought so I trust 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.830

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:09.990

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.220
