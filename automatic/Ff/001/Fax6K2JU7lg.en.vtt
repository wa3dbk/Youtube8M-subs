using white first off for the audio

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.250 
using white first off for the audio
cable<00:02:55.599> it's<00:02:56.599> much<00:02:56.840> more<00:02:57.079> easier<00:02:57.769> and<00:02:58.510> two<00:02:59.510> less

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
cable it's much more easier and two less

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.910

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
confusing now with the stereo composite

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.940 
confusing now with the stereo composite
cable<00:03:04.340> you<00:03:05.150> can<00:03:05.180> use<00:03:05.569> either<00:03:05.900> the<00:03:06.079> red<00:03:06.560> or<00:03:06.890> the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:06.950 
cable you can use either the red or the

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.210 
cable you can use either the red or the
white<00:03:07.489> as<00:03:07.910> your<00:03:08.269> audio<00:03:08.629> cable<00:03:09.110> feel<00:03:09.379> like<00:03:09.650> it

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
white as your audio cable feel like it

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.069 
white as your audio cable feel like it
doesn't<00:03:10.790> really<00:03:10.940> matter<00:03:11.299> which<00:03:11.569> color<00:03:11.930> you

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
doesn't really matter which color you

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.180 
doesn't really matter which color you
use<00:03:12.940> but<00:03:13.940> if<00:03:14.390> you're<00:03:14.989> using<00:03:15.290> the<00:03:15.590> white<00:03:15.860> for

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
use but if you're using the white for

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.509 
use but if you're using the white for
sure<00:03:16.630> it's<00:03:17.630> less<00:03:17.870> confusing<00:03:18.019> so<00:03:18.950> i<00:03:18.980> recommend

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
sure it's less confusing so i recommend

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:25.660 
sure it's less confusing so i recommend
the<00:03:19.819> white<00:03:20.060> ok<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.920> it's<00:03:22.160> pretty<00:03:22.370> easy<00:03:22.819> to<00:03:24.670> put

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
the white ok and it's pretty easy to put

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.059 
the white ok and it's pretty easy to put
it<00:03:25.819> on<00:03:26.030> like<00:03:27.019> that<00:03:27.319> see<00:03:28.209> so<00:03:29.209> no<00:03:29.359> big<00:03:29.599> deal<00:03:30.069> one

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069

now<00:05:10.930> and<00:05:11.930> there<00:05:12.410> we<00:05:12.530> go<00:05:14.170> and<00:05:15.610> the<00:05:16.610> good<00:05:16.820> thing

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
now and there we go and the good thing

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.540 
now and there we go and the good thing
about<00:05:17.120> this<00:05:17.600> it<00:05:17.840> has<00:05:18.440> mono<00:05:18.800> sound<00:05:19.190> on<00:05:19.340> both

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:19.550 
about this it has mono sound on both

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.110 
about this it has mono sound on both
speakers<00:05:20.230> bomb<00:05:21.230> my<00:05:21.500> advice<00:05:21.830> and<00:05:22.160> you'll<00:05:22.910> have

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 
speakers bomb my advice and you'll have

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.360 
speakers bomb my advice and you'll have
mono<00:05:23.420> sound<00:05:23.810> on<00:05:23.990> both<00:05:24.290> speakers<00:05:24.710> of<00:05:24.920> your<00:05:25.100> TV

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
mono sound on both speakers of your TV

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.930 
mono sound on both speakers of your TV
too<00:05:25.760> so<00:05:26.420> that's<00:05:27.260> pretty<00:05:27.560> much<00:05:27.830> it<00:05:27.890> I<00:05:28.400> can't

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:28.940 
too so that's pretty much it I can't

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.460 
too so that's pretty much it I can't
tell<00:05:29.180> you<00:05:29.300> nothing<00:05:29.450> about<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.930> top<00:05:30.140> loader

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
tell you nothing about the top loader

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.520 
tell you nothing about the top loader
because<00:05:30.710> I<00:05:30.830> don't<00:05:31.010> have<00:05:31.100> it<00:05:31.510> this

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
because I don't have it this

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.290 
because I don't have it this
demonstration<00:05:33.530> was<00:05:33.950> mainly<00:05:34.580> for<00:05:34.940> the<00:05:34.970> front

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
demonstration was mainly for the front

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:38.440 
demonstration was mainly for the front
loader<00:05:35.980> so<00:05:36.980> if<00:05:37.550> you<00:05:37.730> have<00:05:37.880> a<00:05:37.910> front<00:05:38.270> loader

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
loader so if you have a front loader

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.850 
loader so if you have a front loader
follow<00:05:39.440> my<00:05:39.650> advice<00:05:40.540> well<00:05:41.560> that's<00:05:42.560> how<00:05:42.770> you

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
follow my advice well that's how you

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.790 
follow my advice well that's how you
hooked<00:05:43.160> up<00:05:43.310> your<00:05:43.490> nes<00:05:44.030> using<00:05:44.450> AV<00:05:44.720> cables<00:05:45.320> the

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
hooked up your nes using AV cables the

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.650 
hooked up your nes using AV cables the
reason<00:05:46.160> why<00:05:46.310> i<00:05:46.340> didn't<00:05:46.910> set<00:05:47.150> up<00:05:47.300> the<00:05:47.450> AC

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
reason why i didn't set up the AC

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.990 
reason why i didn't set up the AC
adapter<00:05:48.020> or<00:05:48.680> the<00:05:48.860> controllers<00:05:49.460> for<00:05:49.820> this

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:50.000 
adapter or the controllers for this

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.390 
adapter or the controllers for this
demonstration<00:05:50.300> is<00:05:50.930> because<00:05:51.830> they're<00:05:52.160> pretty

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
demonstration is because they're pretty

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.050 
demonstration is because they're pretty
easy<00:05:52.490> to<00:05:53.000> do<00:05:53.180> once<00:05:53.450> you<00:05:53.660> get<00:05:53.840> your<00:05:53.990> nes<00:05:54.470> i

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:55.060 
easy to do once you get your nes i

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.310 
easy to do once you get your nes i
wanted<00:05:56.060> to<00:05:56.120> get<00:05:56.240> the<00:05:56.390> harder<00:05:56.750> parts<00:05:57.080> out<00:05:57.260> of

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
wanted to get the harder parts out of

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.160 
wanted to get the harder parts out of
the<00:05:57.440> way<00:05:57.760> that<00:05:58.760> way<00:05:59.060> it'll<00:05:59.420> be<00:05:59.660> much<00:05:59.900> less

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
the way that way it'll be much less

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:03.880 
the way that way it'll be much less
confusing<00:06:00.650> to<00:06:00.890> you<00:06:01.070> and<00:06:01.930> it'll<00:06:02.930> help<00:06:03.200> you<00:06:03.680> out

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
especially so now i did find out that

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:11.260 
especially so now i did find out that
oldest<00:06:08.480> TVs<00:06:08.870> did<00:06:09.080> have<00:06:09.350> those<00:06:09.560> connectors<00:06:10.270> so

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:11.270 
oldest TVs did have those connectors so

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.690 
oldest TVs did have those connectors so
if<00:06:11.810> you're<00:06:12.110> using<00:06:12.320> a<00:06:12.680> stereo<00:06:13.130> composite

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:13.700 
if you're using a stereo composite

cables i recommend the yellow and the
red<00:06:17.630> so<00:06:18.470> and<00:06:19.150> for<00:06:20.150> mono<00:06:20.690> composite<00:06:21.350> cables<00:06:21.710> i

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
red so and for mono composite cables i

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.780 
red so and for mono composite cables i
recommend<00:06:22.520> the<00:06:22.640> yellow<00:06:23.090> and<00:06:23.270> the<00:06:23.360> one<00:06:23.930> so

recommend the yellow and the one so

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.080 
recommend the yellow and the one so
white<00:06:25.790> will<00:06:26.150> work<00:06:26.810> the<00:06:27.050> same<00:06:27.080> as<00:06:27.560> the<00:06:27.950> red<00:06:28.190> it

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.090 
white will work the same as the red it

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.010 
white will work the same as the red it
doesn't<00:06:29.600> really<00:06:29.720> matter<00:06:30.040> it's<00:06:31.040> just<00:06:31.310> a<00:06:31.430> color

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:32.020 
doesn't really matter it's just a color

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:36.040 
doesn't really matter it's just a color
it's<00:06:33.020> no<00:06:33.200> big<00:06:33.410> deal<00:06:33.440> so<00:06:34.190> I<00:06:34.520> just<00:06:35.120> wanted<00:06:35.390> to<00:06:35.510> get

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
it's no big deal so I just wanted to get

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.570 
it's no big deal so I just wanted to get
that<00:06:36.110> out<00:06:36.320> of<00:06:36.530> the<00:06:36.680> way<00:06:36.710> Plus<00:06:37.550> this

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
that out of the way Plus this

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.439 
that out of the way Plus this
demonstration<00:06:38.419> was<00:06:38.720> for<00:06:38.990> newer<00:06:39.140> tvs

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:40.449 
demonstration was for newer tvs

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:45.510 
demonstration was for newer tvs
so<00:06:41.999> things<00:06:42.999> will<00:06:43.569> be<00:06:43.840> a<00:06:44.050> lot<00:06:44.319> better<00:06:44.620> off<00:06:44.979> for

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
so things will be a lot better off for

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.839 
so things will be a lot better off for
you<00:06:45.789> what'd<00:06:46.779> you<00:06:46.930> get<00:06:47.139> your<00:06:47.379> nes<00:06:47.889> if<00:06:48.340> you<00:06:48.669> are

00:06:48.839 --> 00:06:48.849 
you what'd you get your nes if you are

00:06:48.849 --> 00:06:52.429 
you what'd you get your nes if you are
getting<00:06:49.029> the<00:06:49.240> front<00:06:49.509> loader<00:06:49.719> nes<00:06:50.229> and

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:52.439 
getting the front loader nes and

00:06:52.439 --> 00:06:55.619 
getting the front loader nes and
hopefully<00:06:53.439> this<00:06:53.830> demonstration<00:06:54.550> will<00:06:55.389> help
