00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
experiment I got this round tool to

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.890 
experiment I got this round tool to
basically<00:00:16.830> work<00:00:17.760> the<00:00:17.970> backside<00:00:18.390> of<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.600> panel

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
basically work the backside of the panel

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.480 
basically work the backside of the panel
to<00:00:18.960> get<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.230> dents<00:00:19.560> out<00:00:19.680> but<00:00:20.130> what<00:00:20.279> I'm<00:00:20.400> gonna

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
to get the dents out but what I'm gonna

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.960 
to get the dents out but what I'm gonna
do<00:00:20.900> is<00:00:21.900> use<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.500> slapping<00:00:23.070> spoon<00:00:23.430> by<00:00:23.910> the

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
do is use the slapping spoon by the

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.470 
do is use the slapping spoon by the
outside<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:24.930> then<00:00:25.920> use<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.910> one<00:00:27.180> on<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
outside and then use this one on the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.839 
outside and then use this one on the
inside<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.710> see<00:00:28.920> if<00:00:29.010> I<00:00:29.160> can't<00:00:29.429> get<00:00:29.580> some<00:00:29.820> of

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
inside and see if I can't get some of

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.700 
inside and see if I can't get some of
these<00:00:30.000> little<00:00:30.060> dimples<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:31.050> pimples<00:00:31.470> and

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
these little dimples and pimples and

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.400 
these little dimples and pimples and
everything<00:00:32.360> taken<00:00:33.360> care<00:00:33.390> of

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
everything taken care of

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.760 
everything taken care of
first<00:00:35.190> things<00:00:35.399> first<00:00:35.489> hearing<00:00:36.239> protection

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 
first things first hearing protection

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.549 
first things first hearing protection
and<00:00:37.770> then<00:00:38.010> eye<00:00:38.160> protection<00:00:39.290> sorry<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.410> don't

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
get to see my first face but I guess

00:00:43.530 --> 00:01:07.090 
get to see my first face but I guess
that's<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.770> way<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:43.980> goes

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:19.970 

got<00:01:08.100> here

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:19.980 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:23.760 

this<00:01:20.980> is<00:01:21.130> a<00:01:21.160> spot<00:01:21.550> I<00:01:21.580> did<00:01:21.940> earlier<00:01:22.360> and<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:23.740> can

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
this is a spot I did earlier and you can

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.490 
this is a spot I did earlier and you can
see<00:01:23.920> that's<00:01:24.280> kind<00:01:24.580> of<00:01:24.700> high<00:01:24.880> now<00:01:25.150> but<00:01:25.350> I'll<00:01:26.350> go

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
see that's kind of high now but I'll go

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.340 
see that's kind of high now but I'll go
ahead<00:01:26.650> and<00:01:27.040> use<00:01:27.250> my<00:01:27.690> shrinking<00:01:28.690> disk<00:01:28.960> on<00:01:29.140> that

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
ahead and use my shrinking disk on that

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.820 
ahead and use my shrinking disk on that
one

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:29.830 
one

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.640 
one
that<00:01:30.460> ought<00:01:30.610> to<00:01:30.640> bring<00:01:30.880> that<00:01:31.030> one<00:01:31.150> back<00:01:31.210> down

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
that ought to bring that one back down

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.130 
that ought to bring that one back down
but<00:01:32.650> I<00:01:32.710> still<00:01:32.890> got<00:01:33.040> a<00:01:33.070> low<00:01:33.310> spot<00:01:33.610> down<00:01:33.820> here<00:01:34.140> and

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
but I still got a low spot down here and

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.480 
but I still got a low spot down here and
you<00:01:35.230> can<00:01:35.350> always<00:01:35.500> tell<00:01:35.800> when<00:01:36.070> they're<00:01:36.220> alive

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
you can always tell when they're alive

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.360 
you can always tell when they're alive
because<00:01:36.790> the<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:38.260> slapping<00:01:38.710> spoon<00:01:38.950> starts

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
because the the slapping spoon starts

00:01:39.370 --> 00:02:11.020 
because the the slapping spoon starts
bouncing<00:01:39.790> around<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:41.530> another<00:01:41.800> whirl

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.750 

the<00:02:12.030> other<00:02:12.180> thing<00:02:12.450> is<00:02:12.630> is<00:02:12.810> that<00:02:12.990> the<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:14.610> air

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
the other thing is is that the the air

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.990 
the other thing is is that the the air
pressure<00:02:15.090> has<00:02:15.420> been<00:02:15.600> reduced<00:02:16.110> oh<00:02:16.880> look<00:02:17.880> at

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
pressure has been reduced oh look at

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.300 
pressure has been reduced oh look at
that<00:02:18.030> yeah<00:02:21.080> see<00:02:22.080> how<00:02:22.140> that<00:02:22.320> spots<00:02:22.710> get<00:02:22.920> smaller

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
that yeah see how that spots get smaller

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.820 
that yeah see how that spots get smaller
and<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:24.000> is<00:02:24.150> getting<00:02:24.240> little<00:02:24.510> high<00:02:24.830> that's

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
and this is getting little high that's

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.190 
and this is getting little high that's
gonna<00:02:25.980> work<00:02:26.130> nice

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
gonna work nice

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.010 
gonna work nice
so<00:02:29.180> anyway<00:02:30.180> that's<00:02:30.540> how<00:02:30.660> I'm<00:02:30.750> going<00:02:30.840> to<00:02:30.900> work

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
so anyway that's how I'm going to work

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.960 
so anyway that's how I'm going to work
this<00:02:31.170> panel<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:32.430> then<00:02:32.580> I'm<00:02:32.670> going<00:02:32.790> to<00:02:32.849> get

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
this panel and then I'm going to get

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.170 
this panel and then I'm going to get
this<00:02:33.380> shrinking<00:02:34.380> disk<00:02:34.590> out<00:02:34.819> after<00:02:35.819> I<00:02:35.849> get<00:02:36.060> all

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
this shrinking disk out after I get all

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.330 
this shrinking disk out after I get all
this<00:02:36.420> stuff<00:02:36.660> out<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:37.140> I'll<00:02:37.950> take<00:02:38.160> some

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
this stuff out and I'll take some
