00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
trick was actually in there and yes he

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:26.179 
trick was actually in there and yes he
did<00:01:18.210> land<00:01:18.479> it<00:01:24.259> no<00:01:25.259> it<00:01:25.380> was<00:01:25.470> not<00:01:25.650> I'm<00:01:25.979> sure<00:01:26.159> a

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
did land it no it was not I'm sure a

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.770 
did land it no it was not I'm sure a
bunch<00:01:26.430> of<00:01:26.640> people<00:01:26.850> had<00:01:26.970> no<00:01:27.150> idea<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.659> it<00:01:27.689> was

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
bunch of people had no idea that it was

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.179 
bunch of people had no idea that it was
a<00:01:27.840> triple<00:01:28.170> flip<00:01:28.259> though<00:01:28.470> at<00:01:28.680> first<00:01:28.860> he<00:01:29.040> was

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
a triple flip though at first he was

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.289 
a triple flip though at first he was
trying<00:01:29.430> double<00:01:29.790> and<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:29.970> was<00:01:30.060> like<00:01:30.150> dude<00:01:30.240> I

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
trying double and I was like dude I

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.060 
trying double and I was like dude I
think<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.540> going<00:01:30.600> triple<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.229> then<00:01:31.950> he's

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
think it's going triple and then he's

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.109 
think it's going triple and then he's
like<00:01:32.250> all<00:01:32.369> right<00:01:32.400> I'll<00:01:32.579> just<00:01:32.610> kind<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.939> try<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
like all right I'll just kind of try to

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.460 
like all right I'll just kind of try to
fling<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.509> faster<00:01:33.900> and<00:01:33.930> then<00:01:34.110> he<00:01:34.170> ended<00:01:34.350> up

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
fling it faster and then he ended up

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.200 
fling it faster and then he ended up
doing<00:01:34.770> it

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.030 

but<00:01:41.210> it<00:01:41.630> was<00:01:41.780> not<00:01:41.900> smooth<00:01:42.560> at<00:01:42.710> all<00:01:42.830> it<00:01:42.980> was

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
but it was not smooth at all it was

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.680 
but it was not smooth at all it was
really<00:01:43.250> sloppy<00:01:43.490> grants<00:01:44.030> it<00:01:44.120> was<00:01:44.210> triple<00:01:44.540> flip

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
really sloppy grants it was triple flip

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.970 
really sloppy grants it was triple flip
I<00:01:44.810> know<00:01:44.900> you<00:01:44.990> can<00:01:45.110> be<00:01:45.230> sloppy<00:01:45.440> on<00:01:45.680> a<00:01:45.740> triple

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
I know you can be sloppy on a triple

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.860 
I know you can be sloppy on a triple
flip<00:01:46.040> people<00:01:46.430> still<00:01:46.580> like<00:01:46.760> you<00:01:46.910> but<00:01:47.120> I'm

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:47.870 
flip people still like you but I'm

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.200 
flip people still like you but I'm
saying<00:01:48.230> Alex<00:01:49.160> needs<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.430> land<00:01:49.610> is<00:01:49.730> smoother<00:01:50.030> so
