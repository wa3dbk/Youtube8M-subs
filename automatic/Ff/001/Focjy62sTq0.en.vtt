00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
what do you think you'll be able to

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.000

setup<00:00:21.470> look<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.560> think<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.920> think<00:00:23.609> Dave<00:00:24.050> having

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
setup look I think I think Dave having

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.320 
setup look I think I think Dave having
Davis<00:00:25.350> captain<00:00:25.789> makes<00:00:26.789> it<00:00:26.939> bit<00:00:27.180> more

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
Davis captain makes it bit more

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:28.970 
Davis captain makes it bit more
comfortable<00:00:27.720> for<00:00:27.779> me<00:00:28.019> in<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.230> he<00:00:28.439> knows<00:00:28.650> how

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
comfortable for me in that he knows how

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.659 
comfortable for me in that he knows how
i<00:00:29.010> bowl<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:29.550> what<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.699> do<00:00:30.980> look<00:00:31.980> hopefully<00:00:32.430> I

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
i bowl and what I do look hopefully I

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.549 
i bowl and what I do look hopefully I

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
can take some wickets up front and

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
can take some wickets up front and
restrict<00:00:35.340> runs<00:00:35.520> at<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.760> end<00:00:35.910> like<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.239> do<00:00:36.300> with

restrict runs at the end like I do with

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.130

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
really fundamentally I'm just trying to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.139 
really fundamentally I'm just trying to
play<00:00:52.050> my<00:00:52.199> part<00:00:52.469> in<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.680> game<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.149> hopefully

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
guys to bang around with the games

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:04.780 
guys to bang around with the games
rather<00:01:02.879> may<00:01:03.120> I<00:01:03.149> just<00:01:03.390> got<00:01:03.510> a<00:01:03.539> plugin<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:03.930> I

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
rather may I just got a plugin and I

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.640 
rather may I just got a plugin and I
mean<00:01:05.790> I'll<00:01:06.090> see<00:01:06.240> if<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.360> can<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:07.020> gain<00:01:07.200> generally

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
mean I'll see if I can to gain generally

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.399 
mean I'll see if I can to gain generally
quite<00:01:07.830> late<00:01:08.040> so<00:01:08.250> maybe<00:01:08.729> I<00:01:08.909> guess<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.570> one<00:01:10.260> way

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
quite late so maybe I guess the one way

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:11.359 
quite late so maybe I guess the one way
of<00:01:10.470> looking<00:01:10.500> at<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.860> that<00:01:10.950> you<00:01:11.159> haven't

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
of looking at it is that you haven't

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:12.980 
of looking at it is that you haven't
I've<00:01:11.520> had<00:01:11.640> other<00:01:11.820> experiences<00:01:12.090> other<00:01:12.750> crews

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
I've had other experiences other crews

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.330 
I've had other experiences other crews
about<00:01:13.170> where<00:01:13.350> they're<00:01:13.500> being<00:01:13.619> set<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.010> one

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
about where they're being set in one

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.670 
about where they're being set in one
form<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.909> game<00:01:15.119> be<00:01:15.869> appear<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.259> have<00:01:16.320> taken

pigeon-holed as 2020 player that i kind
of<00:01:25.229> consider<00:01:25.290> myself<00:01:25.770> an<00:01:26.340> all-around<00:01:26.850> cricket

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
of consider myself an all-around cricket

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.899 
of consider myself an all-around cricket
a<00:01:27.270> bit<00:01:27.799> you<00:01:28.799> know<00:01:28.829> my<00:01:29.130> age<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.520> probably<00:01:29.790> not

the worst thing to be pigeonholed is
2020<00:01:31.650> because<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.920> means<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.640> don't<00:01:32.820> get<00:01:33.780> so

the UK here these sort of different

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.929 
the UK here these sort of different
versions<00:03:52.590> of<00:03:52.769> it<00:03:52.950> did<00:03:53.310> you<00:03:53.459> think<00:03:53.700> that's<00:03:53.819> what

00:03:53.929 --> 00:03:53.939 
versions of it did you think that's what

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:55.429 
versions of it did you think that's what
other<00:03:54.030> three<00:03:54.239> are<00:03:54.269> all<00:03:54.450> coming<00:03:54.689> together<00:03:54.930> or

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
other three are all coming together or

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:56.780 
other three are all coming together or
other<00:03:55.620> sort<00:03:55.950> of<00:03:55.980> each<00:03:56.189> one<00:03:56.370> has<00:03:56.519> its<00:03:56.549> own

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
other sort of each one has its own

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.140 
other sort of each one has its own
different<00:03:57.780> sort<00:03:58.620> of<00:03:58.680> take<00:03:58.920> on<00:03:59.159> you<00:04:00.030> know

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150 
different sort of take on you know

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.300 
different sort of take on you know
basically<00:04:00.330> 20<00:04:00.750> overs<00:04:00.959> each<00:04:01.080> I<00:04:01.379> think<00:04:02.129> there's

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
basically 20 overs each I think there's

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.580 
basically 20 overs each I think there's
a<00:04:02.400> few<00:04:02.939> different<00:04:03.000> flavors<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:03.840> guess<00:04:04.049> and<00:04:04.349> I

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
a few different flavors I guess and I

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.369 
a few different flavors I guess and I
feels<00:04:05.069> a<00:04:05.159> little<00:04:05.250> bit<00:04:05.400> different<00:04:06.379> just

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
feels a little bit different just

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:10.309 
feels a little bit different just
because<00:04:07.439> of<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:08.840> circus<00:04:09.840> that<00:04:10.019> goes<00:04:10.140> around

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:10.319 
because of the circus that goes around

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.380 
because of the circus that goes around
it<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.680> guess<00:04:10.920> and<00:04:11.250> you<00:04:12.000> know<00:04:12.090> it's<00:04:12.209> not<00:04:12.330> just

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
it I guess and you know it's not just

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.240 
it I guess and you know it's not just
about<00:04:12.659> the<00:04:12.900> cricket<00:04:13.170> I<00:04:13.409> think<00:04:13.950> if<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:14.099> take

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.250 
about the cricket I think if you take

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.770 
about the cricket I think if you take
your<00:04:14.459> cricket<00:04:14.730> too<00:04:14.849> seriously<00:04:15.299> and<00:04:15.390> IPO

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:15.780 
your cricket too seriously and IPO

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.120 
your cricket too seriously and IPO
you'll<00:04:16.109> you'll<00:04:16.440> struggle<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:16.829> get<00:04:16.919> through

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
you'll you'll struggle to get through

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.159 
you'll you'll struggle to get through
the<00:04:17.250> tournament<00:04:17.699> because<00:04:17.790> it's<00:04:18.060> pretty<00:04:18.989> hard

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
the tournament because it's pretty hard

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.659 
the tournament because it's pretty hard
graft<00:04:19.500> and<00:04:19.889> there's<00:04:20.070> so<00:04:20.250> much<00:04:20.400> other<00:04:20.549> stuff

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
graft and there's so much other stuff

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.390 
graft and there's so much other stuff
going<00:04:20.880> on<00:04:21.299> it<00:04:21.479> the<00:04:21.900> tracks

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 
going on it the tracks

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.129 
going on it the tracks
not<00:04:22.790> the<00:04:22.910> tracks<00:04:23.210> from<00:04:23.330> the<00:04:23.449> crib<00:04:23.660> it<00:04:23.840> takes

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
not the tracks from the crib it takes

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:25.870 
not the tracks from the crib it takes
your<00:04:24.259> mind<00:04:24.380> off<00:04:24.560> the<00:04:24.680> credit<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.669> know<00:04:25.699> if

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 
your mind off the credit you know if

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:27.310 
your mind off the credit you know if
you're<00:04:26.030> too<00:04:26.150> focused<00:04:26.360> on<00:04:26.600> cruelty<00:04:26.840> you're

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:27.320 
you're too focused on cruelty you're

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.370 
you're too focused on cruelty you're
heading<00:04:27.880> I<00:04:28.880> guess<00:04:29.360> the<00:04:29.509> flip<00:04:29.900> side<00:04:29.930> of<00:04:30.139> that<00:04:30.259> is

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
heading I guess the flip side of that is

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.719 
heading I guess the flip side of that is
something<00:04:30.680> like<00:04:30.740> the<00:04:30.889> twenty20<00:04:31.340> world<00:04:31.370> cup

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:31.729 
something like the twenty20 world cup

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:36.070 
something like the twenty20 world cup
where<00:04:33.160> you<00:04:34.160> know<00:04:34.280> it's<00:04:34.729> really<00:04:35.389> focused<00:04:35.930> on

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:36.080 
where you know it's really focused on

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:39.760 
where you know it's really focused on
just<00:04:36.500> the<00:04:36.680> credit<00:04:37.009> and<00:04:37.100> nothing<00:04:37.400> else<00:04:37.550> and<00:04:38.770> is

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
just the credit and nothing else and is

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.710 
just the credit and nothing else and is
there's<00:04:40.340> no<00:04:40.460> who<00:04:40.699> play<00:04:40.880> around<00:04:41.210> it<00:04:41.389> there's<00:04:41.539> no

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 
there's no who play around it there's no

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.650 
there's no who play around it there's no
nothing<00:04:42.080> it's<00:04:42.199> just<00:04:42.669> Australia's<00:04:43.669> log<00:04:43.970> of<00:04:44.120> the

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:44.660 
nothing it's just Australia's log of the

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.529 
nothing it's just Australia's log of the
best<00:04:44.840> team<00:04:45.050> win<00:04:45.470> tonight<00:04:45.889> and<00:04:46.070> that's<00:04:46.220> I<00:04:46.580> guess

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:47.539 
best team win tonight and that's I guess

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.450 
best team win tonight and that's I guess
the<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:48.080> other<00:04:48.229> domestic<00:04:49.100> leagues<00:04:49.310> around

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
the the other domestic leagues around

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:50.950 
the the other domestic leagues around
the<00:04:49.639> world<00:04:49.820> like<00:04:50.030> this<00:04:50.060> fit<00:04:50.449> in<00:04:50.539> between<00:04:50.630> the

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
the world like this fit in between the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.980 
the world like this fit in between the
two<00:04:51.639> so<00:04:52.639> certainly<00:04:53.090> different<00:04:53.360> flavors<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:53.960> i

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
two so certainly different flavors and i

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.240 
two so certainly different flavors and i
think<00:04:54.169> that<00:04:54.289> the<00:04:54.440> brand<00:04:54.740> of<00:04:54.889> cricket<00:04:55.100> the

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.250 
think that the brand of cricket the

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:57.010 
think that the brand of cricket the
people<00:04:55.520> play<00:04:55.729> on<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.389> sub<00:04:56.570> colin<00:04:56.900> is

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.020 
people play on the sub colin is

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.270 
people play on the sub colin is
obviously<00:04:57.350> different<00:04:57.530> to<00:04:57.800> every<00:04:58.010> RL

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
obviously different to every RL

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.469 
obviously different to every RL
certainly<00:04:58.699> different<00:04:58.910> to<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.150> West<00:04:59.300> Indies

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 
certainly different to the West Indies

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:00.820 
certainly different to the West Indies
that<00:04:59.720> we've<00:04:59.840> seen<00:05:00.080> and<00:05:00.289> most<00:05:00.680> likely

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
that we've seen and most likely

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.820 
that we've seen and most likely
different<00:05:01.310> to<00:05:01.400> hear<00:05:01.580> as<00:05:01.699> well<00:05:01.729> upset<00:05:02.710> you<00:05:03.710> know

it's the same game same sort of tactics

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.110 
it's the same game same sort of tactics
but<00:05:06.020> it's<00:05:06.199> just<00:05:06.979> just<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.580> bit<00:05:07.699> different<00:05:08.090> i

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
but it's just just a bit different i

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.820 
but it's just just a bit different i
guess<00:05:08.150> i<00:05:08.600> guess<00:05:09.080> one<00:05:09.260> thing<00:05:09.289> about<00:05:09.530> the<00:05:09.680> world
