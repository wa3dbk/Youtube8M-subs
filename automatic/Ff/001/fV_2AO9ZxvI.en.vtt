00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 did you know guys that in here in the 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.569
 soy milk there are a lot of 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.610
 vegetable cheeses hidden together 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.070
 we have already seen how to make the 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.590
 Homemade velvety tofu and today will be 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.480
 the time for vegetable ricotta la 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.760
 preparation is not so difficult 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.100
 but like all things in other words 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.960
 important to respect some small but 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.820
 important precautions and I will 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.740
 I guarantee that if you follow me step by step 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.400
 step you will be able to get a ricotta 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.529
 truly extraordinary vegetable for 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.760
 prepare vegetable ricotta we have 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.489
 need a finger of soy milk not 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:42.600
 sweetened 3 tablespoons of apple vinegar 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.410
 or lemon juice rises up as much 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.469
 just the first thing to do is heat 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:54.539
 soy milk to bring it almost 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.760
 to boil our soy milk is 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.640
 arrived at about 90 degrees then 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.190
 we can extinguish the fire and pour the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.810
 all inside a bowl of 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.670
 inside maybe it's like that 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.439
 now we go to acts of sticking with 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.510
 the acetic acid that is inside 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.510
 of the apple class ok 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:21.880
 we mix and we will see that slowly 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.670
 cariata begins to form because me 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.860
 you ask, I have rightly paid the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.050
 soy milk inside this 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.210
 bowl because contact with steel 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.440
 could somehow compromise 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.780
 the final surrender of ours recalls the 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:39.760
 milk is already falling you see on 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.720
 the back of the wooden spoon can be seen 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:51.640
 already the first curd flakes 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:54.790
 mix for about a minute after 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.090
 that we can also cover with a 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:02.530
 dish towel and let it rest about 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.540
 ten minutes after ten minutes 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.920
 curd has completely formed 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.230
 now I also show you the flakes 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.610
 you see that you see much better than that 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:16.930
 to it what we must do we must 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.320
 remove together as above 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.660
 we prepare high holiday e 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.850
 relatively close we put one 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.610
 colander or a large colander 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:31.700
 then a clean tea towel that does not smell 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:38.390
 of detergent I recommend and we pour 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:41.420
 all the curds so above 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:46.780
 the vegetable ricotta flakes will remain 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:49.490
 while below and a plan you see it 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.620
 take some time clearly maybe 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:59.200
 we can also favor this 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:59.200
 so mixing a little vermont 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:10.640
 and then we are dripping for about 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:12.200
 one hour and a half after about an hour 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.380
 of dripping this is the result 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.780
 then see the ricotta on top 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.700
 it is clearly arden sata and it is 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.840
 separated from the serum that I now make you 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.640
 to see 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:27.350
 here it is below what to do 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.980
 I suggest you add some 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.030
 salt to taste but you can also 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:34.160
 aromatize it with another and ravetta ad 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.450
 example basil parsley also with the 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.160
 part too large once with the 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.160
 paprika and I must say that the result is 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.210
 it was not bad at all 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.290
 mix 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:47.960
 for good the salt will also facilitate the 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.760
 next pure because they are see the 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.790
 ricotta is still quite different nations 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.590
 gironi to take a little more yes here 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.900
 what I did I prepared a 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.670
 pure saucer small bowl for 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:02.930
 avoid direct contact thinking with 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:05.360
 ricotta and a cheese fuscella e 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:12.920
 now we can also fill the 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:23.170
 fuscella we win her give another 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:25.460
 half an hour or an hour later 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:27.350
 half an hour we overturned the 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.540
 fuscella and this is the result of 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:32.090
 turn it was ricotta that I put 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.730
 inside a nice plate full of 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.560
 vegetables I thought I did not throw it and me 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.840
 I recommend you can use it for 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.730
 prepare some bread or the tip and if you can 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.770
 you will follow in the next video we will see 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:44.770
 together how to prepare the pizza plate
