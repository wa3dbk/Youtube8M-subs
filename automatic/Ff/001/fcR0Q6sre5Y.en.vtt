00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Holy today, I have something new again 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.990
 video for you and that I was with 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.370
 my girlfriend at primark shopping and 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.200
 have some pretty nice things 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.639
 found and I thought the show 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.620
 I tell you now because that's all 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.809
 always very interested in what it is currently 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.310
 so at primark there and there I would 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.289
 I'll start right now 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.980
 and that's the first time I've been there 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.820
 this shell gets where that is in so 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.150
 a year 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.289
 orange tone but somehow such a special 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.510
 orange I can not describe it 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.910
 So that's kind of like terracotta 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.250
 orange that's what it's more like 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.510
 and yes I especially liked that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.070
 because it's a little bit 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.690
 I like the airier at the moment 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.480
 like and that fits very well too 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.910
 work and on the back is such a 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.620
 button bar and I think that looks real 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.710
 cool as it is just not quite 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.350
 simple but also has one 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.340
 little fluffy heat and has me 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.829
 very well 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:01.739
 the whole has now cost 13 euros 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:05.670
 then I bought a new one and 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.140
 the looks that has here as a 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.430
 I do not know pattern exactly like me 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.159
 that's what she has to call here too 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.780
 in the back of the poppes I really like that 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.360
 Well, I've been in it for a long time 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.759
 his jeans searched but have no 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.479
 found and you have now just 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.780
 took 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.009
 I would have you better in size 34 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.920
 but it is so hard 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.350
 that there to try but no matter how 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.829
 still fits quite well 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.420
 and yes it cost 17 euros 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.450
 I am relatively expensive for a great 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.040
 cosa or of course it works 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.400
 every case for a pair of pants but for 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.380
 primark I think is the beautiful higher 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.040
 Cheap or next I have 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.350
 I bought socks then that is one 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.700
 seven pack and the whole has three 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.560
 I would actually cost me 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.220
 always new socks at home if I am 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.990
 there I am 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.579
 because so cheap you get the 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.780
 actually nowhere else and me 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.240
 mine are just socks 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.219
 they do not have to be super cool right now 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.290
 be white or something I find white 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.310
 or black simple worries 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.960
 actually best 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.640
 I did not really know yet 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.649
 that things are the same with primark 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.520
 there and then I've got just once 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.120
 here discovered these sports pants 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.450
 is such a closer and yes has behind 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.670
 also with zipper on pop is and 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.680
 yes I have tasted them sitting 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.660
 very nice and they are there too 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.000
 actually for a lot of money to 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:31.270
 example at sport check or so and the 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.040
 has now cost only 9 euros I am 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.130
 curious how they are 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.690
 train feels like but so far 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.410
 me the fabric and the processing 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.940
 pretty good 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.370
 I am not sure if it is 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.510
 but embarrassing is people i still have 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.190
 never my whole life one 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.920
 eyelash curler I find that looks like 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.540
 like a torture tool and I have 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.830
 already a bit shitty to use 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:53.800
 not that i have the vip rouse there 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.900
 travel or so yes I just have this 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.330
 deliver pliers discovered at primark and 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.860
 you beautiful because I'm so pink and 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.740
 even here has such a replacement rubber 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.330
 and everything and only 1 euro 50 tasted 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.800
 and there must me that is the time with and 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.900
 Try out what it is with the 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.700
 eyelash curler has because many of 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:11.590
 the girls swear yes in too 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.810
 armor and say yes so I get 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.660
 my when you go up a lot more 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:17.830
 that makes a difference 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.570
 I'm curious you have 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.270
 experiences with what we become one 

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:24.310
 eyelash curler then I have two more 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.070
 pints fetched files are also like that 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.620
 beautiful pink that look like that and that 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:33.970
 I also tasted 150. I have them 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.830
 So far always a tweezers from the sigma the 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.900
 It was very very good but somehow I did 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.160
 I lost those here I find them 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.250
 Anyway, maybe she does not have me 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.630
 a ghostly wind tunnel gets crowded 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.750
 shit i find i have got behind 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:49.630
 but it is short if this is restrictive 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.430
 maybe bring and I'll say 150 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.959
 It is definitely a very good one 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.160
 Price for a pair of tweezers and there I have 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.500
 you just taken away because the 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:58.540
 also look so beautiful 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.950
 I also have two more times 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.290
 bought those fake lashes so watch the 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.850
 look I find it very very 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.870
 So I'll cut you in any case 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:08.950
 if I have her on it 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.050
 I have definitely 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:12.640
 American youtube viewed that 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.359
 but I had the eyelashes of 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.520
 sigma that looked something like that 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.320
 only in a short time and therefore tried 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.090
 of whether the may also cool was 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.420
 So they definitely see 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.890
 promising to see what that is 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.110
 Result brings with it 

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:30.610
 and last but not least I have one more 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.910
 Wristband brought I said that it 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.870
 just a little primacall and yes that is 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.870
 this one here 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.240
 that is open here 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.310
 and both are always very difficult 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:44.350
 matching bracelet or a matching 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:49.270
 to find a tariff because my wrist is 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:53.650
 extremely small and bigger it sometimes still 

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.240
 way over the hand and then I have 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.440
 Just take this one with you 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.100
 I think that's very close 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:01.290
 sliced 

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.370
 the whole cost five euros and 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.620
 I really like because I like them like 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:08.110
 gold jewelry yes that you already the things 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:09.910
 which I got at primark who 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.770
 Now I want to know where I was 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.660
 at the new friday in dÃ¼sseldorf the 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.620
 is really very nice that is very big 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:16.420
 from the surface 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.640
 he even comes to me a bit 

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:22.690
 bigger than the food and the 

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:23.890
 I think it's really big and yes me 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.730
 I do not really have many now 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:29.740
 found things because yes there has simply 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:30.940
 not so much for me so the 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.430
 had very many beautiful ones 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.350

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:37.030

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.190

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.600

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:42.780
 go because they have real at the moment 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.920
