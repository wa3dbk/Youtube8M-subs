I think visiting the campus was the most
important<00:00:02.760> thing<00:00:02.909> for<00:00:03.120> me<00:00:03.270> just<00:00:03.780> coming<00:00:04.259> to

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
important thing for me just coming to

important thing for me just coming to
this<00:00:04.500> school<00:00:04.799> and<00:00:04.830> and<00:00:05.370> meeting<00:00:05.640> the<00:00:05.850> women

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
this school and and meeting the women

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.360 
this school and and meeting the women
here<00:00:06.450> and<00:00:06.690> seeing<00:00:07.020> that<00:00:07.230> that<00:00:07.859> truly<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.309> is

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
here and seeing that that truly this is

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.669 
here and seeing that that truly this is
a<00:00:08.730> place<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:09.450> I<00:00:09.480> could<00:00:09.690> see<00:00:09.840> myself<00:00:09.870> being<00:00:10.469> at

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
a place that I could see myself being at

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.680 
a place that I could see myself being at
and<00:00:11.490> because<00:00:11.580> it's<00:00:11.880> in<00:00:11.969> Atlanta<00:00:12.090> I<00:00:12.420> didn't

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
and because it's in Atlanta I didn't

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.020 
and because it's in Atlanta I didn't
feel<00:00:12.870> like<00:00:13.139> I<00:00:13.320> would<00:00:13.469> be<00:00:13.500> isolated<00:00:14.190> from<00:00:14.340> the

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
feel like I would be isolated from the

rest<00:00:15.059> of<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.480> world<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:16.049> felt<00:00:16.230> like<00:00:16.320> I

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
rest of the world and I felt like I

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.200 
rest of the world and I felt like I
could<00:00:16.529> have<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.740> balanced<00:00:17.190> life<00:00:17.279> of<00:00:17.609> academia

that's<00:00:50.039> how<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> decided<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:50.940> was<00:00:51.059> no<00:00:51.210> big

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
that's how I decided it was no big

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.479 
that's how I decided it was no big
exciting<00:00:53.840> well-thought-out<00:00:54.840> plan<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.860> how<00:00:56.460> I

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
exciting well-thought-out plan of how I

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.670 
exciting well-thought-out plan of how I
wanted<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.120> just<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.629> felt<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> me

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
wanted it was just it felt right to me

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.910 
wanted it was just it felt right to me
and<00:00:59.570> being<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.750> women's<00:01:01.050> college<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:03.799> think<00:01:04.799> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
and being a women's college I think it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.679 
and being a women's college I think it
was<00:01:05.070> definitely<00:01:05.430> something<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.790> grew<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.659> me

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
was definitely something that grew on me

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.200 
was definitely something that grew on me
it<00:01:06.900> was<00:01:07.049> not<00:01:07.260> not<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.100> plan<00:01:08.460> at<00:01:08.790> all

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
it was not not a plan at all

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.580 
it was not not a plan at all
but<00:01:10.100> being<00:01:11.100> surrounded<00:01:11.549> with<00:01:11.909> such<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.590> strong

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590

been so empowering and has really

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.120 
been so empowering and has really
allowed<00:01:19.830> me<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.520> interact<00:01:21.210> with<00:01:21.810> other<00:01:22.590> women

on a level that I hadn't known it was

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.390 
on a level that I hadn't known it was
possible<00:01:26.220> which<00:01:26.880> seems<00:01:27.590> which<00:01:28.590> seems<00:01:28.920> cheesy

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
possible which seems which seems cheesy

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.819 
possible which seems which seems cheesy
