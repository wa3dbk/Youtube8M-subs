00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.700 
and then we added some Pinot Grigio or
white<00:01:39.820> wine<00:01:40.820> will<00:01:41.240> work<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:41.689> then<00:01:42.140> one<00:01:42.439> cup<00:01:42.680> of

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
white wine will work and then one cup of

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.210 
white wine will work and then one cup of
water

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:43.220 
water

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.980 
water
that's<00:01:43.580> it<00:01:43.820> now<00:01:44.090> we<00:01:44.150> will<00:01:44.330> talk<00:01:44.479> about<00:01:44.600> how

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 
that's it now we will talk about how

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.960 
that's it now we will talk about how
long<00:01:45.290> until<00:01:45.590> they<00:01:46.869> look<00:01:47.869> at<00:01:47.990> it<00:01:48.340> so<00:01:49.340> three

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:49.970 
long until they look at it so three

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.789 
long until they look at it so three
minutes<00:01:50.329> okay<00:01:50.630> usually<00:01:51.110> takes<00:01:51.320> between<00:01:51.380> three

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
minutes okay usually takes between three

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.830 
minutes okay usually takes between three
and<00:01:51.829> ten<00:01:52.070> minutes<00:01:52.280> if<00:01:52.640> they<00:01:53.060> don't<00:01:53.270> open<00:01:53.420> after

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
and ten minutes if they don't open after

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:55.719 
and ten minutes if they don't open after
ten<00:01:54.140> minutes<00:01:54.290> you<00:01:54.710> want<00:01:54.920> to<00:01:55.070> discard<00:01:55.490> those

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
ten minutes you want to discard those

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:57.609 
ten minutes you want to discard those
because<00:01:56.119> they're<00:01:56.450> not<00:01:56.689> good<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:57.320> let's<00:01:57.470> make

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
because they're not good so let's make

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:59.499 
because they're not good so let's make
that<00:01:57.650> point<00:01:58.009> if<00:01:58.250> they<00:01:58.400> don't<00:01:58.640> open<00:01:58.790> after<00:01:59.150> ten

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
that point if they don't open after ten

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.330 
that point if they don't open after ten
minutes<00:01:59.869> and<00:02:00.079> get<00:02:00.320> rid<00:02:00.619> of<00:02:00.649> them<00:02:00.829> get<00:02:01.009> rid<00:02:01.280> of

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
minutes and get rid of them get rid of

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.429 
minutes and get rid of them get rid of
them<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:01.610> now<00:02:02.090> what<00:02:02.509> we're<00:02:02.630> gonna<00:02:02.720> do<00:02:02.930> is<00:02:03.079> see

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
them so now what we're gonna do is see

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.260 
them so now what we're gonna do is see
they<00:02:03.560> just<00:02:03.590> open<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:04.490> we're<00:02:04.610> gonna<00:02:04.729> take<00:02:05.000> these

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
they just open so we're gonna take these

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.009 
they just open so we're gonna take these

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
and I'm gonna use this tool because we

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:10.869 
and I'm gonna use this tool because we

usually when I think of recipe in

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.300 
usually when I think of recipe in
general<00:03:48.920> when<00:03:49.040> I<00:03:49.070> walk<00:03:49.340> up<00:03:49.580> I<00:03:49.730> go<00:03:50.890> by<00:03:51.890> the<00:03:51.950> time

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
general when I walk up I go by the time

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.740 
general when I walk up I go by the time
we're<00:03:52.489> done<00:03:52.519> I'm<00:03:52.880> like<00:03:52.970> I<00:03:53.150> can<00:03:53.360> do<00:03:53.510> this
