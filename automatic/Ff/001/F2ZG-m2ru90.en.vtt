 curry powder that looks like this 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:33.360
 was composed of many tracks 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.780

 Indian family has its own recipe for 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.219
 curry but basically are doing a 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.350
 generality the basic spices that that 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:51.829

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.240
 less strong 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.770
 you reduce the amount of chili 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:38.130
 could throw south cinnamon nutmeg 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:41.250

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.920
 recipes like in particular the with 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.260
 poultry like chicken with the 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.739
 fish as they are roasted 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.840
 with garam masala or curry you can 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.260
 use in starchy foods as for 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.300
 saute pasta rice from 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.209

 Simply with the health to give 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:47.630
 full of ideas the confusion that can 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.489
 to be mixed with this mixture of threads 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.140
 the next mix of tracks comes 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:54.060
 of China 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.940

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.459
 spices traditionally made of five 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:02.450
 maybe more spices according to the recipes 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:05.850
 again and maybe even less 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.100
 in general it is composed of pepper 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.650

 clove and star anise 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.810
 we use the five-spice mix in 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:30.060
 general for here the for pastry 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.090
 but in China site was using a lot 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.700
 to grill meat 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.390
