 select site let's try

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.660
 real mobile site 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:43.910
 Well, let it be for example afisha.ru 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.220
 as we see the site is loading very 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.200
 very fast though the connection is fair 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.910
 saying not broadband and immediately 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.590
 draws on two interesting features 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:54.110
 which is not inside textures 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.360
 is a fast read mode fast mode 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.990
 mode will save up to 80 percent 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.400
 Internet traffic in read mode 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.840
 turns any web page into some 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.420
 a document that can help you 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.490
 read with ease and convenience also 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.650
 page you can edit your friends 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.070
 bookmark send it to 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:16.460
 start screen or add read 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.220
 then navigate through the pages 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.229
 back and forth exercise with not only 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.900
 buttons on and gesture forward back 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:25.370
 respectively 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.990
 worth paying attention to and working with 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.820
 masonry out of the browser 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.310
 open tabs are presented 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.220
 a kind of stack in which you can 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.140
 immediately see the address of the open page 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.740
 and titles you can open it or 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.990
 delete so let me tell you now 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:44.990
 how to move to a new page this is not 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:47.150
 very obviously hang browser features it 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.619
 usually exists from the same starting point 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.930
 tap my navigation you start typing 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.670
 website address either flushes out prompts either 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.619
 ends typing press enter 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.609
 but here we have, for example, opened youtube 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.020
 for example youtube and by the way I can 

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:01.090
 show you quite interesting and 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.369
 useful function we can just 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.920
 watch the video and forget about it 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:08.379
 but as we see shipments we clicked and 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.360
 look are special blue 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:10.840
 button that allows you to download this 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.730
 roller 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.120
 and watch it later offline 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.549
 by the way izyabrauzer has its 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.190
 a file uploader so you can 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:22.900
 see the list and status of all files 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.430
 which you sent for download you can 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.170
 even rename them you can them 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.030
 remove and send for storage in 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.650
 skydrive 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.329
 by the way renaming is quite unusual 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.430
 functions for windows phone 8 since 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:37.000
 windows phone 8 no file manager 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.319
 in principle, no except my screen 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.989
 the navigation which I spoke from the very 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.700
 Start submitting the program to meet 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.769
 also tab my world and best sites 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.019
 the best sites are accordingly a selection 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.620
 all sites that command and 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.760
 developers if the browser 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:55.900
 my world is a collection of bookmarks stories 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.879
 of those pages which were added for 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.459
 readings later as well as the possibility 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.230
 change the theme of your browser except 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.480
 preset ones you can also 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.250
 upload those from the official portal 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.150
 lead took him right in the program and 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.190
 change accordingly also among 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.380
 interesting features essay browser is 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.639
 private mode as well as the opportunity 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.609
 visit the site as yet 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:20.470
 but the most interesting and fun feature 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:23.829
 which we do not expect to meet in the browser 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.019
 this is scanning quarters sadly two 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:27.989
 My friendâ€™s code was not there so I promise 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.840
 this moment 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.159
 so what else do we have left 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.799
 look at the settings 

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:38.170
 by the way if the browser allows you to store 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:39.790
 all logins passwords bookmark history in 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.870
 your cloud for this you need 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.650
 register accordingly 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:47.230
 portal hang browser and log in 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.030
 the program will then synchronize 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:50.530
 and you get the same browser hang 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.870
 which inter you have on the other 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.709
 phone or old phone when you 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:58.000
 changed must also be possible to disable 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.680
 pictures can be customized with this quality 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.389
 paintings which allows also saves 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.609
 traffic and speeds up the loading of web pages and 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:09.159
 closing the program so that it does not occupy 

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:12.540
 the place of memory is made by double seam 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.540
 lads back 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:18.919
 he
