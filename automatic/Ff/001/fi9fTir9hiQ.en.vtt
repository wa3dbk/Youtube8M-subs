and<00:00:56.550> explained<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.090> me<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.390> if<00:00:57.899> you<00:00:58.800> put<00:00:59.010> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
and explained to me this if you put the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.639 
and explained to me this if you put the
salt<00:00:59.370> into<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.329> water<00:01:00.570> before<00:01:00.840> it<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.379> boiling

salt into the water before it is boiling
the<00:01:01.980> salt<00:01:02.520> will<00:01:02.730> bring<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.090> temperature<00:01:03.570> of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
the salt will bring the temperature of

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.289 
the salt will bring the temperature of
the<00:01:03.809> water<00:01:04.019> further<00:01:04.589> down<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.729> then<00:01:06.000> it<00:01:06.180> will

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
the water further down so then it will

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.990 
the water further down so then it will
take<00:01:06.479> longer<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:07.170> boil<00:01:07.380> if<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:08.220> put<00:01:08.400> salt<00:01:08.729> in

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
take longer to boil if you put salt in

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.560
