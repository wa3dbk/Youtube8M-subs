00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
and that works that's all good and gravy

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.390 
and that works that's all good and gravy
but<00:02:01.840> I<00:02:02.140> like<00:02:02.320> to<00:02:02.410> add<00:02:02.560> a<00:02:02.590> little<00:02:02.800> conditioner

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
to it just to give it a little bit more

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.770 
to it just to give it a little bit more
textures<00:02:06.250> with<00:02:06.610> more<00:02:06.790> substance<00:02:07.000> so<00:02:07.420> it's<00:02:07.600> not

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
textures with more substance so it's not

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.080 
textures with more substance so it's not
actual<00:02:08.230> like<00:02:08.440> egg<00:02:08.710> yolk<00:02:08.980> running<00:02:09.880> down<00:02:10.060> my

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
actual like egg yolk running down my

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:12.480 
actual like egg yolk running down my
face<00:02:10.270> so<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.350> kind<00:02:11.560> of<00:02:11.650> the<00:02:11.830> conditioner<00:02:12.310> kind

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
face so it kind of the conditioner kind

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.100 
face so it kind of the conditioner kind
of<00:02:12.610> holds<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.060> all<00:02:13.150> together<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.780> don't<00:02:13.960> add

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
of holds it all together I don't add

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:15.780 
of holds it all together I don't add
that<00:02:14.380> much<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.010> just<00:02:15.040> helps<00:02:15.250> it

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
that much but it just helps it

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.960 
that much but it just helps it
contributes<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:17.170> keeping<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.710> egg<00:02:17.980> from<00:02:18.790> my

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
contributes to keeping the egg from my

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.240 
contributes to keeping the egg from my
not<00:02:19.300> being<00:02:19.330> so<00:02:19.810> yogi<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.320> gross<00:02:20.590> this<00:02:20.860> is<00:02:21.070> the

not being so yogi and gross this is the

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.970 
not being so yogi and gross this is the
