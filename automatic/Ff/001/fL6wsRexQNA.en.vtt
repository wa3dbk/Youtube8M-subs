00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.670
 let's take our cake now 

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.999
 as you have seen we have de corato 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.009
 leaving these little angles of space 

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:16.500
 that is, cream comes towards each other 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.869
 they serve as a guide for threading cookies 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.320
 in this way they envy and support us 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.369
 slightly to the other at the other curl 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:31.019
 so the diagonal practically this 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:37.230
 way and let's go all the way around 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:41.969
 so cake then the top with a 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:45.059
 bit of cocoa via a dusting so much for 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.520
 remember the sweet tender precisely 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.770
 these cookies that have chocolate the 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.440
 cayo naylor ingredients then we have 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.100
 left a space between the first round of 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.399
 flakes and ii and we risk this layer 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.949
 with cereal always of the same type 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:07.250
 I have to do a little attention, I guess 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:09.299
 let you go on the spikes of cream 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.159
 called because cereal then yes 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.380
 they will soften leaving its choirs 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.200
 on the cake however aesthetically 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.280
 they are very nice and they are good anyway 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.970
 even if they remain a little more wet in 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.970
 this way 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:34.229
 obsidian for all of ours 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:38.100
 around then he would have defined it in the photo 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:48.620
 meanwhile let us carry on and one last 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:51.010
 round of biscuits so yes 

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.010
 so 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.960
 finish we put ourselves a lot more 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.649
 cocoa 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.289
 let's see a couple on some more 4 5 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.640
 Cereal stars we limit above 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.640
 It is allowed
