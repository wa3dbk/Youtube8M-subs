 Automatically translated by the machine. Clara Ä§ nail art 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Leopard print is golden! Today, I got my nails filled and redone 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:41.969
 Clara First, the old jewels and 3D parts were removed. 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.910
 Poor bergamot! Poland has also been deleted. 

00:01:21.599 --> 00:01:28.599
 The old nails treated by the stratum corneum are polished. 

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:47.969
 Next the bare nails are filled with acrylic and the shape is in place. 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:59.009
 They were polished to a good finish. Of course all this is with the side of the girl 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.729
 to chat with! The top coat protects the future. 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:27.860
 Then it is all the design. I picked up the crayon base. 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.829
 Soft colors, painting charm. Cute colors! 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:42.900
 Clara draws leopard prints with soft acrylic paint. 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.000
 To make leopard style, she used light brown random spots. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.000
 Dark brown outline. Of course, this is just the beginning. Acrylic 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:08.549
 Bow first. In order to make the bow, she used two big balls 

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:58.469
 acrylic acid. Middle dent and added a small 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:58.289
 Bow middle tie. Back bow complete bling 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.650
 time! Big chunks of bling 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.430
 Remove acrylic acid. Small damantes and pearls after chunks 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.770
 Join them around. The last finish protects it all. 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:20.020
 I love them but don't be too clean and blingy. 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.210
 Of course this lovely nail, we want to share them with you! 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.210
 so beautiful. Santa Clara, thank you! I hope that you like to look at these beautiful 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.210
 The nails came together. Clara is a super genius, so if you are in Melbourne
