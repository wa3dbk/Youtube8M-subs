while a computer science major takes the
course<00:00:40.440> so<00:00:41.190> our<00:00:41.280> goals<00:00:41.489> are<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.730> teach

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
course so our goals are to teach

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.940 
course so our goals are to teach
students<00:00:42.390> about<00:00:42.510> computing<00:00:43.260> teach<00:00:43.710> them<00:00:43.920> a

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
students about computing teach them a

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.100 
students about computing teach them a
programming<00:00:44.460> language<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:45.390> introduce<00:00:45.840> them

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
programming language and introduce them

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.049 
programming language and introduce them
to<00:00:46.140> some<00:00:46.469> introductory<00:00:47.010> algorithms<00:00:47.850> in

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
to some introductory algorithms in

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.389 
to some introductory algorithms in
several<00:00:48.480> different<00:00:48.780> areas<00:00:48.899> so<00:00:49.890> what<00:00:50.100> happens

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
several different areas so what happens

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.020 
several different areas so what happens
on<00:00:50.489> a<00:00:50.550> daily<00:00:50.910> basis<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.449> class<00:00:52.579> we<00:00:53.579> used<00:00:53.820> to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
on a daily basis in class we used to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.369 
on a daily basis in class we used to
teach<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:55.070> as<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.809> standard<00:00:57.809> of<00:00:57.899> lecture<00:00:58.230> and

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
teach it as a standard of lecture and

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.979 
teach it as a standard of lecture and
problem<00:00:58.859> set<00:00:59.160> course<00:00:59.520> but<00:01:00.329> we<00:01:00.480> found<00:01:00.809> that

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
problem set course but we found that

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.020 
problem set course but we found that
many<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.530> students<00:01:01.949> would<00:01:02.160> delay<00:01:02.550> until

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
many of the students would delay until

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.729 
many of the students would delay until
the<00:01:03.180> night<00:01:03.329> before<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.899> problem<00:01:04.320> set<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
the night before the problem set to

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.649 
the night before the problem set to
really<00:01:04.920> come<00:01:05.280> to<00:01:05.460> grips<00:01:05.610> with<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.090> material

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
really come to grips with the material

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.840 
really come to grips with the material
often<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:07.619> wee<00:01:07.799> hours<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.400> morning

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
often in the wee hours of the morning

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.410 
often in the wee hours of the morning
and<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> inspired<00:01:10.740> by<00:01:10.830> colleagues<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.909> physics

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and so inspired by colleagues in physics

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.109 
and so inspired by colleagues in physics
we<00:01:12.630> tried<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.380> incorporate<00:01:13.979> active<00:01:14.790> learning

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
we tried to incorporate active learning

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.719 
we tried to incorporate active learning
techniques<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.680> course<00:01:16.920> so<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.580> an

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
techniques in the course so in an

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.429 
techniques in the course so in an
average<00:01:18.119> week<00:01:18.360> we'll<00:01:18.659> have<00:01:18.869> one<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.259> two

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
average week we'll have one of the two

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.120 
average week we'll have one of the two
standard<00:01:20.009> lectures<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:21.150> we'll<00:01:21.509> also<00:01:22.350> have<00:01:22.680> at

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
standard lectures but we'll also have at

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.820 
standard lectures but we'll also have at
least<00:01:23.310> one<00:01:23.700> session<00:01:24.090> where<00:01:25.020> after<00:01:25.590> presenting

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
least one session where after presenting

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.969 
least one session where after presenting
the<00:01:26.430> material<00:01:26.580> we<00:01:27.360> then<00:01:27.630> ask<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.320> students<00:01:28.799> to

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
the material we then ask the students to

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.429 
the material we then ask the students to
work<00:01:29.220> through<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.670> problem<00:01:30.140> while<00:01:31.140> we're

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
work through a problem while we're

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.219 
work through a problem while we're
available<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.579> answer<00:01:32.759> questions<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.990> the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
available to answer questions and the

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.450 
available to answer questions and the
TAS<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> course<00:01:35.360> circulate<00:01:36.360> to<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.930> in

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
TAS in the course circulate to and in

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.219 
TAS in the course circulate to and in
working<00:01:38.460> out<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> problem<00:01:39.329> very<00:01:39.630> often<00:01:39.930> that

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
working out the problem very often that

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.950 
working out the problem very often that
involves<00:01:40.619> programming<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.150> we've<00:01:42.360> introduced

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
involves programming so we've introduced

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.859 
involves programming so we've introduced
the<00:01:43.170> use<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.470> laptops<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.460> class<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.750> it

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
the use of laptops in the class so is it

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.719 
the use of laptops in the class so is it
a<00:01:45.930> small<00:01:46.200> group<00:01:46.470> type<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.829> structure<00:01:47.250> then<00:01:47.430> or

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
a small group type of structure then or

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.670 
a small group type of structure then or
how<00:01:47.970> does<00:01:48.149> how<00:01:48.659> does<00:01:48.689> the<00:01:48.899> lecturer<00:01:49.290> versus

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
how does how does the lecturer versus

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.580 
how does how does the lecturer versus
the<00:01:49.860> small<00:01:50.700> group<00:01:50.909> aspect<00:01:51.810> of<00:01:51.899> it<00:01:51.990> work<00:01:52.110> well

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
the small group aspect of it work well

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.710 
the small group aspect of it work well
both<00:01:52.770> those<00:01:52.979> activities<00:01:53.430> take<00:01:53.670> place<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
both those activities take place in a

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.749 
both those activities take place in a
lecture<00:01:55.140> style<00:01:55.380> hall<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.280> the<00:01:56.310> students<00:01:56.700> are

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
lecture style hall but the students are

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.520 
lecture style hall but the students are
doing<00:01:56.820> very<00:01:57.119> different<00:01:57.240> things<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.170> lecture

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
doing very different things in a lecture

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.010 
doing very different things in a lecture
it's<00:01:58.649> very<00:01:58.829> traditional<00:01:59.420> one<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.540> us<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.869> in

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
it's very traditional one of us is in

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.109 
it's very traditional one of us is in
front<00:02:01.229> of<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.380> class<00:02:01.590> for<00:02:02.490> sustained<00:02:02.850> periods

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:25.079 
exercises and then we'll talk about them

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:26.990 
exercises and then we'll talk about them
we'll<00:02:25.230> reassemble<00:02:25.650> everybody<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.819> more

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
we'll reassemble everybody in more

electro style to have a discussion about

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.280 
electro style to have a discussion about
what<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.489> assignment<00:02:30.090> was<00:02:30.390> about<00:02:30.659> and<00:02:31.079> that

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
what that assignment was about and that

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.690 
what that assignment was about and that
might<00:02:31.530> go<00:02:31.650> back<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.099> forth<00:02:32.280> several<00:02:32.489> times

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
might go back and forth several times

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.250 
might go back and forth several times
with<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.299> course<00:02:33.510> of<00:02:33.659> an<00:02:33.750> active<00:02:34.049> learning

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
with the course of an active learning

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.920 
with the course of an active learning
session<00:02:34.709> so<00:02:35.670> how<00:02:35.819> our<00:02:35.940> students<00:02:36.269> assess<00:02:36.720> in

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
session so how our students assess in

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.330 
session so how our students assess in
this<00:02:37.049> area<00:02:37.349> is<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.560> mostly<00:02:37.769> on<00:02:37.920> their<00:02:38.010> coding

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
this area is it mostly on their coding

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.130 
this area is it mostly on their coding
assignments<00:02:38.819> are<00:02:38.970> there<00:02:39.090> also<00:02:39.209> exams<00:02:39.870> and

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
assignments are there also exams and

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.780 
assignments are there also exams and
quizzes<00:02:40.260> or<00:02:40.859> can<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.069> say<00:02:41.280> more<00:02:41.430> about<00:02:41.489> that

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
quizzes or can you say more about that

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.199 
quizzes or can you say more about that
there<00:02:42.629> are<00:02:42.720> exams<00:02:43.260> and<00:02:43.680> quizzes<00:02:43.859> but<00:02:44.579> nobody

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
there are exams and quizzes but nobody

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.569 
there are exams and quizzes but nobody
programs<00:02:45.690> best<00:02:46.079> under<00:02:46.440> pressure<00:02:46.470> so<00:02:47.190> the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
programs best under pressure so the

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:48.530 
programs best under pressure so the
problem<00:02:48.090> sets

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
problem sets

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.680 
problem sets
we<00:02:49.379> feel<00:02:49.680> are<00:02:49.890> a<00:02:50.099> more<00:02:50.519> reliable<00:02:50.909> means<00:02:51.420> of

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
we feel are a more reliable means of

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.830 
we feel are a more reliable means of
assessing<00:02:52.680> the<00:02:52.829> students<00:02:53.159> and<00:02:53.400> actually<00:02:53.940> we

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
assessing the students and actually we

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.589 
assessing the students and actually we
think<00:02:55.139> a<00:02:55.349> lot<00:02:55.709> of<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.920> learning<00:02:56.340> in<00:02:57.150> the

00:02:57.589 --> 00:02:57.599 
think a lot of the learning in the

00:02:57.599 --> 00:02:59.360 
think a lot of the learning in the
course<00:02:57.780> comes<00:02:58.170> from<00:02:58.470> working<00:02:58.709> through<00:02:59.159> those

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
course comes from working through those

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.869 
course comes from working through those
problem<00:02:59.970> sets<00:03:00.379> so<00:03:01.379> by<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.190> end<00:03:02.340> of<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.670> course

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
problem sets so by the end of the course

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:06.680 
problem sets so by the end of the course
we<00:03:03.180> actually<00:03:03.950> combine<00:03:04.950> two<00:03:05.819> problem<00:03:06.359> sets

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
we actually combine two problem sets

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.530 
we actually combine two problem sets
over<00:03:07.230> two<00:03:07.799> or<00:03:07.950> three<00:03:08.250> weeks<00:03:08.519> where<00:03:08.909> we<00:03:09.060> ask<00:03:09.239> the

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
over two or three weeks where we ask the

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.930 
over two or three weeks where we ask the
students<00:03:09.930> in<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.260> first<00:03:10.409> problem<00:03:10.709> set<00:03:11.220> to

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
students in the first problem set to

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:15.229 
students in the first problem set to
plan<00:03:12.239> a<00:03:12.569> much<00:03:13.139> more<00:03:13.409> major<00:03:13.739> assignment<00:03:14.579> and<00:03:14.819> we

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
plan a much more major assignment and we

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:17.240 
plan a much more major assignment and we
pair<00:03:15.599> them<00:03:15.750> up<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.139> they're<00:03:16.319> working<00:03:16.739> in<00:03:16.889> teams

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
pair them up so they're working in teams

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.939 
pair them up so they're working in teams
and<00:03:17.549> then<00:03:18.120> they<00:03:18.299> could<00:03:18.540> their<00:03:18.780> own<00:03:18.900> design<00:03:19.379> for

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:19.949 
and then they could their own design for

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.670 
and then they could their own design for
the<00:03:20.040> final<00:03:20.430> problem<00:03:20.879> set<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.329> course<00:03:21.680> and

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
the final problem set of the course and

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.879 
the final problem set of the course and
what<00:03:22.889> size<00:03:23.099> teams<00:03:23.519> would<00:03:23.790> they<00:03:23.940> be<00:03:24.239> working<00:03:24.419> in

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:24.889 
what size teams would they be working in

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:27.670 
what size teams would they be working in
we<00:03:25.889> usually<00:03:26.220> use<00:03:26.370> teams<00:03:26.699> of<00:03:26.910> two

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:27.680 
we usually use teams of two

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.199 
we usually use teams of two
it's<00:03:28.680> always<00:03:28.919> a<00:03:28.949> trade-off<00:03:29.280> larger<00:03:29.970> teams

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
it's always a trade-off larger teams

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:31.879 
it's always a trade-off larger teams
could<00:03:30.419> do<00:03:30.540> bigger<00:03:30.780> projects<00:03:31.379> but<00:03:31.590> then<00:03:31.739> the

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
could do bigger projects but then the

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.619 
could do bigger projects but then the
logistics<00:03:32.459> particularly<00:03:33.060> at<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.209> end<00:03:33.329> of<00:03:33.540> a

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
logistics particularly at the end of a

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.599 
logistics particularly at the end of a
busy<00:03:33.780> semester<00:03:34.470> of<00:03:34.650> the<00:03:35.069> students<00:03:35.400> getting

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
busy semester of the students getting

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.699 
busy semester of the students getting
together<00:03:35.849> to<00:03:36.269> cooperate<00:03:36.480> turn<00:03:37.440> out<00:03:37.560> to<00:03:37.680> be

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
together to cooperate turn out to be

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.860 
together to cooperate turn out to be
complicated<00:03:38.459> so<00:03:38.699> we've<00:03:38.879> decided<00:03:39.209> on<00:03:39.449> teams<00:03:39.720> of

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
complicated so we've decided on teams of

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.339 
complicated so we've decided on teams of
two

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
two

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.839 
two
occasionally<00:03:41.129> we'll<00:03:41.280> have<00:03:41.400> a<00:03:41.430> team<00:03:41.639> of<00:03:41.699> three

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:41.849 
occasionally we'll have a team of three

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:44.750 
occasionally we'll have a team of three
who<00:03:42.720> or<00:03:43.139> in<00:03:43.379> some<00:03:43.650> rare<00:03:43.980> cases<00:03:44.010> someone<00:03:44.669> will

who or in some rare cases someone will

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.629 
who or in some rare cases someone will
just<00:03:44.790> do<00:03:45.030> the<00:03:45.180> assignment<00:03:45.269> on<00:03:45.750> his<00:03:46.169> or<00:03:46.290> her<00:03:46.410> own

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
just do the assignment on his or her own

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.710 
just do the assignment on his or her own
actually<00:03:47.639> the<00:03:47.790> undergraduates<00:03:48.269> in

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
actually the undergraduates in

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.750 
actually the undergraduates in

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
really isn't about the programming

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:43.500 
really isn't about the programming
language<00:05:42.520> they<00:05:42.849> learn<00:05:43.030> the<00:05:43.180> programming

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
language they learn the programming

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.360 
language they learn the programming
language<00:05:43.960> but<00:05:44.770> it's<00:05:44.919> really<00:05:45.099> about

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:45.370 
language but it's really about

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.779 
language but it's really about
algorithmic<00:05:46.300> design<00:05:46.800> reusable<00:05:47.800> code<00:05:48.010> modules

00:05:48.779 --> 00:05:48.789 
algorithmic design reusable code modules

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:50.610 
algorithmic design reusable code modules
the<00:05:49.570> notion<00:05:49.870> of<00:05:49.930> object-oriented

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:50.620 
the notion of object-oriented

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.950 
the notion of object-oriented
programming<00:05:51.220> and<00:05:51.550> I<00:05:52.120> personally<00:05:52.570> have<00:05:52.720> taught

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:52.960 
programming and I personally have taught

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.270 
programming and I personally have taught
it<00:05:53.110> and<00:05:53.169> I<00:05:53.260> think<00:05:53.320> four<00:05:53.710> or<00:05:53.830> five<00:05:53.979> different

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
it and I think four or five different

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.140 
it and I think four or five different
languages<00:05:54.970> over<00:05:55.120> the<00:05:55.300> last<00:05:55.680> 25<00:05:56.680> years<00:05:57.150> okay

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
languages over the last 25 years okay

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.520 
languages over the last 25 years okay
well<00:05:58.539> thank<00:05:58.840> you<00:05:58.930> very<00:05:58.960> much<00:05:59.260> for
