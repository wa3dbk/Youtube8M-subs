was gone and that was three years ago so
this<00:01:59.250> is<00:01:59.430> something<00:02:00.149> planned<00:02:00.479> special<00:02:01.020> for

this<00:02:04.280> would<00:02:04.430> probably<00:02:04.520> be<00:02:04.700> one<00:02:04.850> of<00:02:04.940> my<00:02:05.000> top

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060
