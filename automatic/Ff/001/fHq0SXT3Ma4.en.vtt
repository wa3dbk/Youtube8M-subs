00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 but we are not the ones to win and the 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.339
 final as I said before I thought 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.259
 that we had the possibility of how he was going 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.620
 the match of trying to try 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.620
 earn it 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.389
 but martínez de 10 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:16.010
 mourinho has said he did not want to talk 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:18.380
 of the arbitrators and stressed that there was 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.240
 committed an important error the 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.980
 collegiate and pp asked for a possible 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.290
 Iniesta's penalty has said that they 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.290
 they are like this teatreros bothers you 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.570
 it does not cause me to talk about the 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.130
 referees and spoken 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.200
 but good 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.280
 we could also start to analyze 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.230
 all the blocks of a match 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.960
 let's analyze the second goal that lack 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.700
 very clear that they do to Andrew and that the 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.200
 same from the saying in the locker room that 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.090
 play take out a second punch 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.770
 arbitration is very difficult let's start 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.620
 to analyze once we have everything not only 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.700
 what interests us 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.540
 and the subject of 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.490
 from pepe we can make a video with all 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.590
 his images and his kicks 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.440
 what are you going to say 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:04.589
 Titov in the afternoon by anita n knit 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.960
 radio 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.909
 So you do not understand that Real Madrid 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.789
 speak of arbitrators and will also lend you 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.710
 if you understand that the club has finished 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:15.000
 attack us that a team that is eight 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.750
 classification points that seemed 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.750
 that was enough with the tie 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.869
 it does not depend on me 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.100
 sometimes it's not what it is not what you do not 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.140
 is what you want sometimes is your 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.080
 physical condition like how do you feel 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.000
 they thought that in a counter 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.159
 least they could catch the last moment 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.619
 have a better strategy that are more 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.240
 high that we think has been 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.680
 seen very good match bad match 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.539
 football 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.179
 years has been ahead of us 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:45.280
 we have put ahead we have been we have 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.080
 relatively fast marking the idea a 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.399
 little of taking out alexis was because I'm 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.619
 here is above and we would have more 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:54.520
 spaces behind him what happens that what 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.770
 It has been has been very fast but 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.420
 I do not say anything more to say about the subject of 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.219
 the albos I have commented that is that it is 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.920
 very difficult 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.390
 víctor mur del hsbc has opted for 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.729
 make only two changes I do not know if you've 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.590
 seen the fresh team had salt in the 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.250
 replacement to villa because you have opted for 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.030
 this option 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.980
 Normally when you make a 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.540
 instead it's because you think there are some 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.830
 thing of the team that you can improve like 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.360
 if we had been ahead of the 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.670
 scoreboard values ​​are played we 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.660
 can help in the air game like 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.550
 that the strategy game and 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.140
 possibly it will not be below equal 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.450
 that our front for the end to 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.890
 see if we could score a goal from 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.550
 all ways of going to the game well 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.830
 we are coming to opposing goal 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:39.160
 with options to score he saw the match 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.960
 I did not see improvement for those last 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.700
 minutes 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.050
 if I launched a brand wheel I wanted 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.340
 ask him what he said mourinho is 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.330
 first match because he has commented 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.220
 who had told him that he had been a 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.280
 great game then here he complained a little 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:53.830
 of the arbitrators wanted to ask him if his 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:57.130
 good his behavior with respect to you 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:59.940
 it is different or there is no change 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.940
 with mourinho 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.970
 we have also found ourselves in the 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.540
 hallway to follow and he told me great 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.000
 party I also said great match 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.069
 before I had no relationship with him and 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.989
 now we did not greet each other before it was the 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.019
 second coach and I did not come no 

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.019
 I should say hello but it was a relationship 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:21.019
 correct 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.240
 surely the coaches 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.760
 you will find negative things but 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.290
 talking about specific plays in a 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.730
 match that gives me the impression that has 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.890
 been the most complete that can be 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.390
 see at this moment in terms of game 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:38.390
 alternatives and 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:46.140
 and I say that is not more important to talk 

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.140
 of a match that has been super complete 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.709
 within a match and there are so many 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:52.150
 plays that could be faults that do not 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.700
 have been out of the game one centimeter 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.379
 that has been that in the end sometimes of the 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:58.030
 importance that that play what 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.859
 we said of andrés finish in him they fit 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.209
 goal but it is very difficult for the 

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.129
 referee is right all I think what 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:05.799
 I 've said before that it was a 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:08.469
 show that both teams have 

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.420
 had opportunities to win it I think that 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:13.540
 us in the second part we 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.999
 had more and better and that too 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.989
 I prefer that we talk about football 

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:18.729
 that has been seen in the field of 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.930
 show that has been seen and also 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:21.930
 I'm more of this idea 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:27.140
 let's ask what you thought you 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.960
 the environmental show the environment has 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:32.690
 happened today at the camp nou I think so 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.360
 has been very good with once again the 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:38.180
 Barça people have behaved 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.760
 as they have encouraged, they have encouraged 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:43.760
 team animators thank you a 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.689
 more time for now to help us what 

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.699
 what they have helped us 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.490
 and they have manifested peacefully 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.090
 without more 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.090
 giunta 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.860
 or good or sometimes enrique yunta 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.960
 I wanted to ask you remember a 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.569
 rivalry as exciting as that of 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:06.300
 Messi Christian Ronaldo players in 

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.719
 the same time so so differentials 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.719
 to the rest 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.060
 no no no no I know I think the two try 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:14.830
 do what's best for that team of 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:17.410
 try to score the highest goals and 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.630
 try to score what wins the highest 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.410
 maximum title is clear that they are two 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:22.410
 very good players 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.380
 that they have achieved in practically the 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.990
 same time than young although the leo is 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:34.530
 younger possibly follows 

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:36.570
 if I read it not not like this in this same 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.790
 age or of this same age of Christian 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.510
 well, it would be more recognized but 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:43.620
 has had the luck the misfortune of 

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.110
 coincide with this player who has 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.650
 increased before we will not see it again 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:50.449
 a player and you 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.490
 for the night this here back you 

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.520
 we would give the national radio of Spain 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.440
 said jose mourinho in the press room 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.210
 that has come a long way since it is 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:01.220
 the real madriz to Barcelona that when 

00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.139
 he arrived was far away and now he 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:05.260
 He believes that it is very close to you 

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:07.889
 he also has that appreciation 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.639
 I do not know with your words 

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:10.639
 I dont know 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:19.039
 hello very good I wanted to ask you a 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:19.039
 little by the positioning in the field 

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:27.959
 it's difficult that context is not something 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.429
 what happens in a more calasanz way 

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:31.800
 complicated to answer that question me 

00:06:29.429 --> 00:06:35.099
 has said that he is about to understand and to 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:39.419
 that the senate has come with walid old 

00:06:35.099 --> 00:06:41.939
 of three years and now stop for the passage 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:44.000
 like as a boss because you do not have to 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:46.280
 know how they are 

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.380
 I do not answer because he has not wanted respect 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.360
 absolute to the centrals there were more 

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:52.520
 spaces for second entries 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.560
 lines and that he can attend as he has 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.790
 happened to happen in the past 

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.160
 matches but that is a game that is so 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:59.390
 intelligent that yes that sometimes 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.770
 can you say today that it is possible that 

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.750
 find a little more space here a 

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:04.190
 little more space but the party already 

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.750
 he sees it is that sometimes he gets 

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:08.450
 end you say because there they will receive 

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.400
 easier the player who apart from being 

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:14.720
 very good very well reads the game very well 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:16.250
 another question if two things together 

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:18.140
 sconces and the feeling that there 

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:21.230
 wudnesh football here policy uy to the field 

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:23.780
 and two if the play pedro to the last 

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:25.980
 minute symbolizes that it is the player and that 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:28.920
 that is team 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:30.180
 you have commented that all the weight of a 

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.879
 football game that if there is any 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:35.679
 political issue 

00:07:32.879 --> 00:07:38.369
 we can not translate without 

00:07:35.679 --> 00:07:38.369
 increasing 

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:50.459
 this is also saying he liked the 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.459
 account accounts
