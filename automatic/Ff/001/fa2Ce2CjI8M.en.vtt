00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
will allow you to activate the nest to

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.090 
will allow you to activate the nest to

activate all of them simultaneously

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.209 
activate all of them simultaneously
whenever<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.270> feel<00:02:03.479> like<00:02:03.689> it<00:02:04.020> I<00:02:04.530> advise<00:02:05.189> you

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
whenever you feel like it I advise you

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.550 
whenever you feel like it I advise you
to<00:02:05.399> activate<00:02:05.850> them<00:02:06.210> right<00:02:06.450> before<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:07.079> Gorgon

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
to activate them right before the Gorgon

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.279 
to activate them right before the Gorgon
reaches<00:02:08.129> your<00:02:08.610> let's<00:02:09.390> see<00:02:09.539> let's<00:02:09.899> say<00:02:10.080> your

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
reaches your let's see let's say your

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.020 
reaches your let's see let's say your
middle<00:02:10.679> tumor<00:02:10.950> that's<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.220> way<00:02:11.310> I<00:02:11.340> do<00:02:11.550> that

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
middle tumor that's the way I do that

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.430 
middle tumor that's the way I do that
but<00:02:12.330> if<00:02:12.420> you<00:02:12.510> don't<00:02:12.690> have<00:02:12.810> malignant<00:02:13.260> clip

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
but if you don't have malignant clip

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.770 
but if you don't have malignant clip
again<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.160> want<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.520> delay<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:14.910> as<00:02:15.180> much<00:02:15.750> as

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
again you want to delay it as much as

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.050 
again you want to delay it as much as
possible<00:02:16.310> Gordon<00:02:17.310> could<00:02:17.459> not<00:02:17.610> attacked<00:02:17.940> your

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
possible Gordon could not attacked your

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.940 
possible Gordon could not attacked your
creep<00:02:18.270> tumors<00:02:18.630> unless<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.140> has<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.470> vision<00:02:19.740> of

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
creep tumors unless it has the vision of

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.290 
creep tumors unless it has the vision of
that<00:02:20.130> and<00:02:20.310> it<00:02:20.340> will<00:02:20.520> not<00:02:20.700> have<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.000> vision<00:02:21.180> of

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
that and it will not have the vision of

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.080 
that and it will not have the vision of
it<00:02:21.480> because<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.260> just<00:02:22.380> has<00:02:22.590> no<00:02:22.740> capacity<00:02:23.090> there

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
it because it just has no capacity there

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.400 
it because it just has no capacity there
will<00:02:24.209> be<00:02:24.240> no<00:02:24.390> Ravens<00:02:24.930> there<00:02:25.080> will<00:02:25.170> be<00:02:25.290> no

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
will be no Ravens there will be no

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:26.540 
will be no Ravens there will be no
toilet<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:25.950> don't<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.280> worry<00:02:26.430> about

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
toilet so you don't have to worry about

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.780 
toilet so you don't have to worry about
anything<00:02:26.910> else<00:02:27.390> as<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:28.560> activate<00:02:29.190> your<00:02:29.220> first

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
anything else as you activate your first

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.550 
anything else as you activate your first
nest<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.720> need<00:02:30.900> to<00:02:30.989> make<00:02:31.140> sure<00:02:31.170> that<00:02:31.440> you

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
nest you need to make sure that you

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.199 
nest you need to make sure that you
continue<00:02:31.830> pushing<00:02:32.190> and<00:02:32.459> push<00:02:32.610> all<00:02:32.850> the<00:02:33.030> way<00:02:33.060> to

continue pushing and push all the way to

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:36.979 
continue pushing and push all the way to
the<00:02:33.420> fourth<00:02:33.720> nest<00:02:34.970> once<00:02:35.970> you<00:02:36.209> destroy<00:02:36.420> the

the fourth nest once you destroy the

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.290 
the fourth nest once you destroy the
Gorgon<00:02:37.560> just<00:02:38.250> keep<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.580> in<00:02:38.670> mind<00:02:38.880> right<00:02:39.150> to

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
Gorgon just keep it in mind right to

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.059 
Gorgon just keep it in mind right to
save<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.870> game<00:02:40.050> right<00:02:40.260> before<00:02:40.709> it<00:02:40.830> so<00:02:40.950> that

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
save the game right before it so that

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.559 
save the game right before it so that
you<00:02:41.190> can<00:02:41.340> may<00:02:41.459> try<00:02:41.700> it<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:41.910> may<00:02:42.030> try<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.270> once

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
you can may try it you may try it once

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.210 
you can may try it you may try it once
again<00:02:42.900> or<00:02:43.020> just<00:02:43.050> restart<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.650> doesn't<00:02:43.980> take<00:02:44.100> so
