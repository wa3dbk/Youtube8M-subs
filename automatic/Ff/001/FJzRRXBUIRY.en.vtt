I would have wanted them to the reason

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.880 
I would have wanted them to the reason
being<00:01:38.520> I<00:01:38.820> made<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.390> figures<00:01:39.750> before<00:01:40.610> at<00:01:41.610> least

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
being I made the figures before at least

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.609 
being I made the figures before at least
three<00:01:43.890> days<00:01:44.100> before<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:45.000> cake<00:01:45.869> was<00:01:46.079> assembled

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
three days before the cake was assembled

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.660 
three days before the cake was assembled
so<00:01:47.460> we<00:01:47.790> I<00:01:47.970> had<00:01:48.270> initially<00:01:48.540> planned<00:01:49.110> on<00:01:49.380> putting

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
so we I had initially planned on putting

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.230 
so we I had initially planned on putting
Baby<00:01:50.670> Bop<00:01:50.970> and<00:01:51.180> BJ<00:01:51.270> on<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> lower<00:01:52.430> tier<00:01:53.430> but

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
Baby Bop and BJ on the lower tier but

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.300 
Baby Bop and BJ on the lower tier but
then<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:54.930> lady<00:01:55.170> called<00:01:55.470> back<00:01:55.710> saying<00:01:56.070> that

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
then the lady called back saying that

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.700 
then the lady called back saying that
she<00:01:56.490> was<00:01:56.640> having<00:01:56.820> few<00:01:57.240> people<00:01:57.600> coming<00:01:58.380> for<00:01:58.619> the

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
she was having few people coming for the

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.270 
she was having few people coming for the
party<00:01:58.740> so<00:01:59.369> she<00:01:59.399> reduced<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.570> size<00:02:01.280> and

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
party so she reduced on the size and

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.370 
party so she reduced on the size and
therefore<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.820> reduced<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.780> lower<00:02:04.049> tail

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
therefore we reduced on the lower tail

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.219 
therefore we reduced on the lower tail
which<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.799> right<00:02:05.369> now<00:02:05.579> 1/8<00:02:06.000> inch<00:02:06.240> I<00:02:06.600> was<00:02:06.899> hoping

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
which is right now 1/8 inch I was hoping

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.029 
which is right now 1/8 inch I was hoping
that<00:02:07.290> it<00:02:07.530> would<00:02:07.680> be<00:02:07.829> at<00:02:08.369> least<00:02:08.429> 10<00:02:08.849> inches<00:02:10.009> so<00:02:11.009> I

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
that it would be at least 10 inches so I

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.040 
that it would be at least 10 inches so I
had<00:02:11.310> end<00:02:11.580> up

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.050 
had end up

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.050 
had end up
you're<00:02:13.050> moving<00:02:13.320> the<00:02:13.530> two<00:02:13.860> figures<00:02:14.280> on<00:02:14.520> to<00:02:14.820> the

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
you're moving the two figures on to the

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.980 
you're moving the two figures on to the
top<00:02:15.300> up<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:17.000> just<00:02:18.000> through<00:02:18.360> in<00:02:18.480> the<00:02:18.660> stars

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990
