Hey Guys, we're Mat and Danielle

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.960
from Exploring Alternatives.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.280
And we just finished driving across the country in our camper van

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.240
from Ottawa, Canada to Seattle, Washington,
USA.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.930
We did it in the winter which is a bit crazy

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.480
but it was a beautiful trip so I'm really
glad we did it.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.360
And we did a timelapse video of all the photos

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.560
we took along the way, so enjoy.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.980
See you later!
