00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
hello this is Rob Chisholm free-flight

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.690 
hello this is Rob Chisholm free-flight
and<00:00:03.750> I'd<00:00:03.899> like<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.230> help<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.950> lower<00:00:05.250> air<00:00:05.430> time

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
and I'd like to help the lower air time

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.760 
and I'd like to help the lower air time
pilots<00:00:06.180> understand<00:00:06.750> about<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.200> next<00:00:07.440> coming

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
pilots understand about the next coming

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.280 
pilots understand about the next coming
months<00:00:08.069> we're<00:00:08.220> going<00:00:08.340> to<00:00:08.550> thermal<00:00:08.940> activity

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:09.290 
months we're going to thermal activity

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.560 
months we're going to thermal activity
high<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.559> air<00:00:11.519> time<00:00:11.790> pilots<00:00:12.179> have<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.330> looking

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
high in air time pilots have a looking

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.810 
high in air time pilots have a looking
to<00:00:12.690> cross<00:00:12.990> country<00:00:13.259> and<00:00:13.769> they<00:00:14.250> won't<00:00:14.490> be<00:00:14.549> rid

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
to cross country and they won't be rid

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.760 
to cross country and they won't be rid
soaring<00:00:15.330> so<00:00:15.839> we're<00:00:15.960> going<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.139> cover<00:00:16.320> areas

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
soaring so we're going to cover areas

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.099 
soaring so we're going to cover areas
like<00:00:16.980> take<00:00:17.369> off<00:00:17.550> if<00:00:17.820> you're<00:00:18.330> not<00:00:18.359> flying<00:00:18.750> or

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
like take off if you're not flying or

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.800 
like take off if you're not flying or
somebody<00:00:20.039> you<00:00:20.369> know<00:00:20.939> move<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.330> kit<00:00:21.539> move

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
somebody you know move the kit move

somebody you know move the kit move
themselves<00:00:22.410> out<00:00:22.500> of<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.680> area<00:00:23.010> because

themselves out of that area because

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.320 
themselves out of that area because
that's<00:00:23.369> where<00:00:23.550> you're<00:00:23.640> going<00:00:23.730> to<00:00:23.820> launch<00:00:24.060> from

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
that's where you're going to launch from

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.089 
that's where you're going to launch from
and<00:00:24.539> possibly<00:00:24.930> land<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.590> don't<00:00:25.769> want<00:00:25.980> people

rich soaring don't necessarily always
mix<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.380> what<00:00:35.010> would<00:00:35.190> you<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.579> if<00:00:35.670> you're

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
mix and what would you do if you're

mix and what would you do if you're
coming<00:00:35.969> into<00:00:36.149> top<00:00:36.420> land<00:00:36.660> what<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:37.020> look<00:00:37.170> out

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
coming into top land what to look out

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.229 
coming into top land what to look out
for<00:00:37.440> well<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> pilots<00:00:38.579> fighting<00:00:39.090> the

nothing over there and then all of a

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.189 
nothing over there and then all of a
sudden<00:00:50.370> your<00:00:50.760> glider<00:00:51.000> gets<00:00:51.329> disturbed<00:00:51.780> what's

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
sudden your glider gets disturbed what's

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.049 
sudden your glider gets disturbed what's
that<00:00:52.410> about<00:00:52.710> slow<00:00:53.640> it<00:00:53.820> down

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
happening there but the glider is

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.749 
happening there but the glider is
controlled<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.500> the<00:01:16.590> pilot<00:01:16.979> not<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.340> pilot<00:01:17.670> in

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.190 
give yourself room now what would you
happen<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.700> the<00:01:32.820> pilot<00:01:33.180> gets<00:01:33.299> close<00:01:33.750> but<00:01:34.140> you

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
happen here the pilot gets close but you

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.810 
happen here the pilot gets close but you
don't<00:01:34.409> know<00:01:34.560> this<00:01:34.710> until<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.130> get<00:01:35.280> closer<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
don't know this until you get closer to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.819 
don't know this until you get closer to
them<00:01:36.060> would<00:01:36.420> you<00:01:36.450> turn<00:01:36.780> in<00:01:36.960> front<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.619> them

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
them would you turn in front of them

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.620 
them would you turn in front of them
because<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.610> probably<00:01:38.820> give<00:01:39.060> them<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.210> heart<00:01:39.420> I

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
because you probably give them a heart I

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.749 
because you probably give them a heart I
do<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.680> might<00:01:40.890> end<00:01:41.040> up<00:01:41.159> flying<00:01:41.430> into<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
do you might end up flying into the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.760 
do you might end up flying into the
yellow<00:01:41.939> glider<00:01:42.270> or<00:01:42.570> do<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.750> go<00:01:42.869> downwind<00:01:43.500> with

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
yellow glider or do you go downwind with

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.380 
yellow glider or do you go downwind with
a<00:01:43.799> ridge<00:01:44.040> on<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.250> right<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.700> can't<00:01:44.939> really

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
a ridge on the right you can't really

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.090 
a ridge on the right you can't really
get<00:01:45.570> much<00:01:45.750> closer<00:01:46.079> so<00:01:46.530> you're<00:01:46.710> going<00:01:46.860> along

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
get much closer so you're going along

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.370 
get much closer so you're going along
going<00:01:47.850> fast<00:01:48.270> over<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.659> ground<00:01:48.869> faster<00:01:49.259> than

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
going fast over the ground faster than

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.380 
going fast over the ground faster than
you<00:01:49.500> could<00:01:49.680> run<00:01:49.950> fastening<00:01:50.610> do<00:01:50.820> appear<00:01:51.149> life

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
you could run fastening do appear life

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.060 
you could run fastening do appear life
and<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:52.170> gliders<00:01:52.530> getting<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> bit<00:01:52.920> close

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
and this gliders getting a bit close

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.999 
and this gliders getting a bit close
probably<00:01:54.030> best<00:01:54.750> turn<00:01:55.200> left

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
probably best turn left

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.639 
probably best turn left
get<00:01:56.280> into<00:01:56.579> wind<00:01:56.790> if<00:01:56.969> anything<00:01:57.270> goes<00:01:57.479> wrong

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
get into wind if anything goes wrong

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.410 
get into wind if anything goes wrong
least<00:01:58.649> I'm<00:01:58.799> not<00:01:58.920> coming<00:01:59.219> down<00:01:59.250> wind<00:01:59.729> hard<00:02:00.060> into

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
least I'm not coming down wind hard into

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.080 
least I'm not coming down wind hard into
the<00:02:00.540> ground<00:02:00.780> so<00:02:01.770> think<00:02:02.189> about<00:02:02.430> it<00:02:02.640> in<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.909> pod

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
the ground so think about it in a pod

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.609 
the ground so think about it in a pod
harness<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.570> running<00:02:03.840> get<00:02:04.020> your<00:02:04.140> feet<00:02:04.409> out<00:02:04.439> in

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
harness you running get your feet out in

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.100 
harness you running get your feet out in
time<00:02:05.009> now<00:02:05.850> here<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.659> clearly<00:02:06.990> see

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
time now here you can clearly see

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.320 
time now here you can clearly see
obviously<00:02:07.740> they're<00:02:08.039> close<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.550> look<00:02:08.849> more

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
obviously they're close but look more

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.900 
obviously they're close but look more
interestingly<00:02:09.750> at<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.619> wing<00:02:10.860> left<00:02:11.640> side

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
interestingly at the wing left side

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.490 
interestingly at the wing left side
loads<00:02:12.300> a<00:02:12.420> break<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.050> it's<00:02:13.200> going<00:02:13.290> to

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
loads a break and it's going to

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.320 
loads a break and it's going to
juice<00:02:13.710> a<00:02:13.860> lot<00:02:13.980> of<00:02:14.160> turbulence<00:02:14.340> so<00:02:14.880> left<00:02:15.210> side

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
juice a lot of turbulence so left side

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:18.200 
juice a lot of turbulence so left side
again<00:02:15.860> red<00:02:16.860> that<00:02:17.220> marks<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.700> turbulence

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:18.210 
again red that marks the turbulence

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:19.940 
again red that marks the turbulence
right<00:02:18.600> side<00:02:18.900> no<00:02:19.470> break

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
right side no break

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.740 
right side no break
so<00:02:20.220> all<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.520> turbulent<00:02:21.030> air<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.270> coming<00:02:21.570> your

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
so all that turbulent air is coming your

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.870 
so all that turbulent air is coming your
way<00:02:21.780> as<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.710> go<00:02:22.740> into<00:02:23.130> the<00:02:23.340> next<00:02:23.490> coming<00:02:23.850> months

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
way as we go into the next coming months

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.910 
way as we go into the next coming months
so<00:02:24.240> we're<00:02:24.480> in<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.600> month<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:25.050> March<00:02:25.350> now<00:02:25.650> you're

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
so we're in a month of March now you're

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.710 
so we're in a month of March now you're
going<00:02:26.040> to<00:02:26.100> have<00:02:26.220> thermal<00:02:26.700> activity<00:02:26.970> mix<00:02:27.540> with

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
going to have thermal activity mix with

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.210 
going to have thermal activity mix with
Ridge<00:02:27.960> soaring<00:02:28.350> Bridge<00:02:28.590> soaring<00:02:28.920> doesn't

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
Ridge soaring Bridge soaring doesn't

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.670 
Ridge soaring Bridge soaring doesn't
always<00:02:29.550> mix<00:02:29.880> with<00:02:30.090> thermal<00:02:30.420> activity<00:02:30.690> so<00:02:31.410> be

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
always mix with thermal activity so be

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.560 
always mix with thermal activity so be
safe<00:02:31.950> looking<00:02:32.430> out<00:02:32.520> for<00:02:32.670> each<00:02:32.760> other<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.240> talk

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
safe looking out for each other and talk

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.900 
safe looking out for each other and talk
