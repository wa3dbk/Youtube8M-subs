I was actually sent samples of the

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.310 
I was actually sent samples of the
products<00:00:23.040> which<00:00:23.670> are<00:00:23.850> these<00:00:24.060> bio<00:00:24.450> chips<00:00:24.960> that

are supposed to do one of the three
things<00:00:27.240> there<00:00:27.570> are<00:00:27.630> three<00:00:27.990> different<00:00:28.140> kinds

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
things there are three different kinds

things there are three different kinds
of<00:00:28.650> chips<00:00:28.890> one<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.210> give<00:00:30.390> you<00:00:30.540> some<00:00:30.810> sort<00:00:31.050> of

of chips one is to give you some sort of

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.790 
of chips one is to give you some sort of
energy<00:00:31.650> or<00:00:31.950> to<00:00:32.820> energy<00:00:33.210> boost<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:34.350> others<00:00:34.590> to

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
energy or to energy boost the others to

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:17.479 
was really for just one reason alone and

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.330 
was really for just one reason alone and
that<00:01:17.840> reason<00:01:18.170> has<00:01:18.979> to<00:01:19.009> do<00:01:19.399> with<00:01:19.759> the<00:01:20.090> cost<00:01:21.340> the

people<00:01:59.300> drop<00:01:59.810> out<00:02:00.050> and<00:02:00.380> so<00:02:01.190> for<00:02:01.640> me<00:02:01.819> personally

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
people drop out and so for me personally

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.800 
people drop out and so for me personally
I've<00:02:02.750> chosen<00:02:03.170> not<00:02:03.590> to<00:02:03.890> build<00:02:04.430> businesses<00:02:05.390> that

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
I've chosen not to build businesses that

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.800 
I've chosen not to build businesses that
require<00:02:06.020> a<00:02:06.860> hundred<00:02:07.310> dollars<00:02:07.610> or<00:02:07.759> more<00:02:08.030> to

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
require a hundred dollars or more to

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.289 
require a hundred dollars or more to
build<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.410> business<00:02:09.759> on<00:02:10.759> a<00:02:10.820> monthly

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
build the business on a monthly

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.479 
build the business on a monthly
auto-ship<00:02:11.600> because<00:02:12.440> I<00:02:12.620> found<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.160> most

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
auto-ship because I found that most

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.660 
auto-ship because I found that most
people<00:02:14.060> have<00:02:14.510> a<00:02:14.540> hard<00:02:14.660> time<00:02:15.140> with<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.530> and<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:16.310> I

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
people have a hard time with it and so I

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.430 
people have a hard time with it and so I

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
why one it's a business where it's got a

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:39.179 
why one it's a business where it's got a
generic<00:02:32.920> product<00:02:35.969> that<00:02:36.969> anybody<00:02:37.780> can<00:02:37.989> use<00:02:38.189> to

00:02:39.179 --> 00:02:39.189 
generic product that anybody can use to

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.209 
generic product that anybody can use to
build<00:02:39.370> their<00:02:39.939> business<00:02:40.480> or<00:02:41.170> hobby<00:02:41.799> or

00:02:44.009 --> 00:02:44.019 
whatever it is that they're interested

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:46.349 
whatever it is that they're interested
in<00:02:44.379> and<00:02:44.680> it's<00:02:45.430> something<00:02:45.639> that<00:02:45.909> anyone<00:02:46.180> can

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:46.359 
in and it's something that anyone can

00:02:46.359 --> 00:02:49.470 
in and it's something that anyone can
use<00:02:46.599> and<00:02:47.109> would<00:02:47.829> be<00:02:47.980> helpful<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.670> most<00:02:49.030> people

use and would be helpful to most people

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.470 
use and would be helpful to most people
and<00:02:49.719> so<00:02:49.959> it's<00:02:50.109> very<00:02:50.170> generic<00:02:50.950> in<00:02:51.040> nature<00:02:51.120> too

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
and so it's very generic in nature too

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:59.759 
and so it's very generic in nature too
is<00:02:53.549> that<00:02:54.549> the<00:02:54.730> cost<00:02:55.030> is<00:02:55.480> affordable<00:02:58.019> and<00:02:59.019> so

00:02:59.759 --> 00:02:59.769 
is that the cost is affordable and so

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:02.429 
is that the cost is affordable and so
the<00:02:59.950> opportunity<00:03:00.579> that<00:03:00.700> I<00:03:00.760> choose<00:03:01.150> to<00:03:01.209> to<00:03:02.019> take

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:02.439 
the opportunity that I choose to to take

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:06.860 
the opportunity that I choose to to take
part<00:03:02.799> into<00:03:03.010> something<00:03:03.489> that<00:03:03.609> only<00:03:03.700> cost<00:03:04.030> $10

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.589 

not<00:03:07.870> only<00:03:08.109> that<00:03:08.349> but<00:03:08.680> it's<00:03:09.069> $10<00:03:09.909> a<00:03:09.939> month<00:03:10.060> and

attrition<00:03:33.459> rate<00:03:33.669> that<00:03:33.909> I've<00:03:34.030> seen<00:03:34.329> in

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
attrition rate that I've seen in

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.839 
attrition rate that I've seen in

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
between 40 and 60 percent retention rate

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.030 
between 40 and 60 percent retention rate
with<00:03:42.549> this<00:03:42.699> business<00:03:43.209> which<00:03:43.870> long<00:03:44.169> term<00:03:44.590> will

family so this is the business model
that<00:03:50.349> I've<00:03:50.470> chosen<00:03:50.769> this<00:03:51.189> is<00:03:51.340> what<00:03:51.639> I<00:03:51.669> like<00:03:51.970> is

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
that I've chosen this is what I like is

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.330 
that I've chosen this is what I like is
the<00:03:52.299> product<00:03:52.720> that<00:03:52.900> anyone<00:03:53.319> can<00:03:53.470> use<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:53.979> they

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
the product that anyone can use and they

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.099 
the product that anyone can use and they
could<00:03:54.489> use<00:03:54.519> it<00:03:54.790> to<00:03:54.909> build<00:03:55.030> other<00:03:55.329> businesses

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
could use it to build other businesses

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.589 
could use it to build other businesses
if<00:03:56.290> they<00:03:56.319> like<00:03:56.620> to<00:03:56.650> and<00:03:57.159> the<00:03:57.939> cost<00:03:58.209> is<00:03:58.540> very

00:03:58.589 --> 00:03:58.599 
if they like to and the cost is very

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:00.479 
if they like to and the cost is very
affordable<00:03:59.439> and<00:03:59.709> so<00:03:59.889> there's<00:04:00.069> not<00:04:00.220> a<00:04:00.280> lot<00:04:00.459> of

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
affordable and so there's not a lot of

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:02.610 
affordable and so there's not a lot of
risk<00:04:00.819> for<00:04:01.269> those<00:04:01.419> that<00:04:01.659> are<00:04:01.780> trying<00:04:02.079> to<00:04:02.259> break

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
risk for those that are trying to break

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.699 
risk for those that are trying to break
into<00:04:02.919> the<00:04:03.189> industry

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
into the industry

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.559 
into the industry
learn<00:04:03.950> how<00:04:04.129> to<00:04:04.159> build<00:04:04.340> residual<00:04:04.909> income<00:04:05.299> and

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
learn how to build residual income and

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:08.229
