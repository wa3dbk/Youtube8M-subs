 wonderful two-sided blouse 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:17.160
 because the questions started why this 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:19.970
 she's called a double-sided jacket 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.970

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.030
 black and white material i.e. 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:31.410

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:36.770

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:57.780

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.370

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:15.050
 from this side this jacket is white with such 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:18.090
 tears in which you can see black fabric 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.660
 all pudge it's all wired nowhere 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.780
 sticks out 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:25.830
 that is, it is a full bilateral 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:31.370
 we can wear a jacket from this side 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.370
 name breaks both on the back and profit 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.680
 I now for the convenience of Vazquez hands him 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.680
 which is faster 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.500
 Generally sweater without hands and with hands 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.240
 dressing is absolutely normal just 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:57.790
 to show it all now 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:00.100
 worn this way from whom 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.360
 allows, in principle, there were arms 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:08.039
 with brushes nothing difficult to accelerate 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:11.920
 up comforts there is such an option 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.410
 blouse you can lower it a little 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.660
 put on the bird she was to be here 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:21.730
 you can stand out her 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.060
 like this raise a little bit and then 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.930
 she will be like this 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.930
 looks 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.100
 then you can such 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.849
 carry it 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.650
 So 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:47.659
 now go she just 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:52.760
 2 some blouse with a drop 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:53.110
 shoulders behind it means it will be like this 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.680
 here 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:59.840
 all Spanish splits to the exact 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.030
 also the black version can be worn 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:05.420
 both back and forth because the neckline 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:08.480
 made the same this is an option if 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.599
 we wear even fit lifted 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.180
 if we let in a little bit on the hips 

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:18.819
 jacket looks good with jeans and with 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.819
 skirt all
