um<00:00:00.089> this<00:00:00.840> is<00:00:01.050> this<00:00:01.410> is<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.620> heat<00:00:01.949> exchanger<00:00:02.689> we

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
um this is this is a heat exchanger we

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.039 
um this is this is a heat exchanger we
call<00:00:04.080> it<00:00:04.290> here<00:00:04.319> on<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.920> box<00:00:05.430> the<00:00:06.210> HAF<00:00:06.810> see

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
call it here on the box the HAF see

get about 200 degrees Fahrenheit this
will<00:00:51.960> not<00:00:52.199> vaporize<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.129> fuel<00:00:53.399> but<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.699> will

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
will not vaporize the fuel but it will

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.869 
will not vaporize the fuel but it will
preheat<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.539> fuel<00:00:54.860> so<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.920> heat<00:00:56.309> your<00:00:56.340> fuel

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
preheat the fuel so you heat your fuel

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.959 
preheat the fuel so you heat your fuel
is<00:00:57.030> now<00:00:57.210> being<00:00:57.510> preheated<00:00:58.379> as<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.710> goes<00:00:58.920> in<00:00:58.969> now

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
is now being preheated as it goes in now

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
known for a long time is that if you

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.530 
known for a long time is that if you
take<00:01:03.899> magnets<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.430> put<00:01:05.670> magnets<00:01:05.970> on<00:01:06.330> your

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
it goes in when you ionize it you line

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.820 
it goes in when you ionize it you line
all<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.060> molecules<00:01:12.390> up<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.229> as<00:01:13.619> the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
all the molecules up and as the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
molecules come into your engine they

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.530 
molecules come into your engine they
burn<00:01:16.170> more<00:01:16.409> systematically<00:01:17.369> and<00:01:17.759> you<00:01:18.299> get

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
burn more systematically and you get

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.380 
burn more systematically and you get
more<00:01:18.840> of<00:01:19.020> a<00:01:19.140> full<00:01:19.380> burn<00:01:19.650> out<00:01:19.920> of<00:01:20.159> it<00:01:20.340> now<00:01:21.090> this

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
more of a full burn out of it now this

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.039 
more of a full burn out of it now this
right<00:01:21.659> here<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.320> only<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:23.100> my<00:01:23.280> knowledge

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:24.049 
right here is the only to my knowledge

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:28.310 
right here is the only to my knowledge
the<00:01:25.049> only<00:01:25.439> heat<00:01:25.890> exchanger<00:01:26.520> that<00:01:26.780> is<00:01:27.780> also

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
the only heat exchanger that is also

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.179 
the only heat exchanger that is also
magnetic<00:01:28.909> it's<00:01:29.909> made<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.360> aluminum<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.200> to

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
magnetic it's made of aluminum and to

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.359 
magnetic it's made of aluminum and to
have<00:01:32.340> magnetic<00:01:32.790> aluminum<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:33.659> quite<00:01:33.930> weird<00:01:34.369> so

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
have magnetic aluminum is quite weird so

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.109 
have magnetic aluminum is quite weird so
but<00:01:36.270> actually<00:01:36.900> this<00:01:37.619> not<00:01:37.920> only<00:01:37.950> is<00:01:38.400> preheating

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
but actually this not only is preheating

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.020 
but actually this not only is preheating
your<00:01:39.150> fuel<00:01:39.540> but<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:39.960> is<00:01:40.140> also<00:01:40.850> ionizing<00:01:41.850> your

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
your fuel but it is also ionizing your

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.480 
your fuel but it is also ionizing your
fuel<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.570> preheating<00:01:43.320> and<00:01:43.530> ionizing<00:01:44.189> your

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
fuel so preheating and ionizing your

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.870 
fuel so preheating and ionizing your
fuel<00:01:46.130> sending<00:01:47.130> your<00:01:47.310> fuel<00:01:47.640> into<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.930> engine

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
fuel sending your fuel into the engine

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.789 
fuel sending your fuel into the engine
so<00:01:50.880> that<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.630> conditioner<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:52.500> further

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
so that the conditioner and further

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.330 
so that the conditioner and further
break<00:01:53.159> it<00:01:53.369> down<00:01:53.960> vaporize<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:56.130> can<00:01:56.310> be

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
break it down vaporize it and it can be

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.780 
break it down vaporize it and it can be
mixed<00:01:56.729> with<00:01:56.880> now<00:01:57.450> as<00:01:57.780> your<00:01:58.079> computer<00:01:58.759> senses<00:01:59.759> a

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
mixed with now as your computer senses a

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.899 
mixed with now as your computer senses a
rich<00:02:00.149> or<00:02:00.360> fuel<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:01.020> then<00:02:01.860> reduces<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:02.759> amount

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
rich or fuel it then reduces the amount

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.850 
rich or fuel it then reduces the amount
of<00:02:03.240> fuel<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.509> you're<00:02:03.840> putting<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.380> because

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
of fuel that you're putting in because

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.190 
of fuel that you're putting in because
you're<00:02:05.520> already<00:02:05.909> rich<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.869> when<00:02:07.049> you're

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
you're already rich so when you're

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.160 
you're already rich so when you're
running<00:02:07.469> rich<00:02:07.879> you<00:02:08.879> don't<00:02:09.149> need<00:02:09.390> as<00:02:09.599> much<00:02:09.629> fuel

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
running rich you don't need as much fuel

now<00:02:11.129> speaking<00:02:11.760> of<00:02:11.910> the<00:02:12.090> computer<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.780> do<00:02:13.200> have

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
now speaking of the computer you do have

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:14.000 
now speaking of the computer you do have
a<00:02:13.410> problem

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
a problem

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.670 
a problem
there<00:02:14.250> because<00:02:14.790> the<00:02:15.330> computer<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.080> designed

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
there because the computer is designed

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.550 
there because the computer is designed
to<00:02:17.459> protect<00:02:17.700> General<00:02:18.420> Motors<00:02:18.629> or<00:02:19.019> to<00:02:19.170> protect

to protect General Motors or to protect
the<00:02:19.709> manufacturer<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.930> have<00:02:22.170> your<00:02:22.470> fuel

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
the manufacturer and to have your fuel

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.520 
the manufacturer and to have your fuel
do<00:02:23.250> what<00:02:23.459> they<00:02:23.730> want<00:02:24.030> it<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.329> do<00:02:25.010> well<00:02:27.200> we<00:02:28.200> have

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
do what they want it to do well we have

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.130 
do what they want it to do well we have
something<00:02:28.950> that's<00:02:29.250> enriching<00:02:29.670> your<00:02:30.090> fuel<00:02:30.450> so

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
something that's enriching your fuel so

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.990 
something that's enriching your fuel so
they<00:02:31.290> can<00:02:31.500> reduce<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.280> amount<00:02:32.519> of<00:02:32.700> fuel<00:02:32.909> that

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
they can reduce the amount of fuel that

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.839 
they can reduce the amount of fuel that
you<00:02:33.239> got<00:02:33.450> but<00:02:33.659> if<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.870> runs<00:02:34.079> lean<00:02:34.610> for<00:02:35.610> a<00:02:35.640> long

00:02:35.839 --> 00:02:35.849 
you got but if it runs lean for a long

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.490 
you got but if it runs lean for a long
enough<00:02:36.030> period<00:02:36.180> of<00:02:36.569> time<00:02:36.780> your<00:02:37.019> computer

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
into full rich when it does that yes you

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
but all of a sudden where's the fuel

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.300 
but all of a sudden where's the fuel
economy<00:02:51.599> at<00:02:51.750> your<00:02:51.959> computer<00:02:52.349> has<00:02:52.620> said<00:02:52.829> no<00:02:53.129> no

no<00:02:53.340> no<00:02:53.670> no<00:02:53.879> we<00:02:54.060> can't<00:02:54.329> have<00:02:54.540> this<00:02:54.829> so<00:02:55.829> we've

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
no no no we can't have this so we've

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.170 
no no no we can't have this so we've
designed<00:02:56.549> also<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.840> little<00:02:58.319> sensor<00:02:59.310> that<00:03:00.030> we

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
designed also a little sensor that we

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.349 
designed also a little sensor that we
can<00:03:00.389> install<00:03:00.659> on<00:03:01.109> your<00:03:01.139> car<00:03:01.590> you<00:03:02.340> have<00:03:02.609> o2

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:03.359 
can install on your car you have o2

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.479 
can install on your car you have o2
sensors<00:03:03.930> that<00:03:04.079> are<00:03:04.139> measuring<00:03:04.709> the<00:03:04.859> oxygen

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
sensors that are measuring the oxygen

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.449 
sensors that are measuring the oxygen
content<00:03:05.790> in<00:03:06.180> your<00:03:06.269> catalytic<00:03:06.870> converter<00:03:07.459> so

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
content in your catalytic converter so

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.339 
content in your catalytic converter so
we've<00:03:08.700> designed<00:03:08.909> something<00:03:09.510> that<00:03:09.840> is<00:03:10.019> going

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
we've designed something that is going

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.860 
we've designed something that is going
to<00:03:10.500> send<00:03:10.769> a<00:03:10.920> signal<00:03:11.159> back<00:03:11.400> to<00:03:12.030> your<00:03:12.239> computer

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
to send a signal back to your computer

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:15.800 
to send a signal back to your computer
and<00:03:13.109> we're<00:03:14.069> going<00:03:14.280> to<00:03:14.430> change<00:03:14.760> the<00:03:15.060> set<00:03:15.359> points

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
and we're going to change the set points

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.319 
and we're going to change the set points
with<00:03:15.959> this<00:03:16.139> little<00:03:16.409> device<00:03:17.159> we're<00:03:18.120> going<00:03:18.239> to

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
with this little device we're going to

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:21.379 
with this little device we're going to
change<00:03:18.660> the<00:03:18.930> set<00:03:19.199> point<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:19.859> that<00:03:20.129> when<00:03:21.120> your

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:21.389 
change the set point so that when your

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:24.860 
change the set point so that when your
o2<00:03:21.599> sensors<00:03:22.410> sense<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.549> it's<00:03:23.879> too<00:03:24.449> rich<00:03:24.690> or

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
o2 sensors sense that it's too rich or

this<00:04:09.060> system<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.659> the<00:04:10.500> only<00:04:10.739> reason<00:04:11.639> that<00:04:11.669> we

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
this system and the only reason that we

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
did build this system is that we

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.469 
did build this system is that we
discovered<00:04:14.400> with<00:04:14.940> our<00:04:15.090> pre-ignition

your exhaust system off and throw it
away<00:04:48.020> we<00:04:49.020> thought<00:04:49.350> that<00:04:49.410> we<00:04:50.340> would<00:04:50.520> try<00:04:50.729> to

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
away we thought that we would try to

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.240 
away we thought that we would try to
bring<00:04:51.060> some<00:04:51.090> interim<00:04:52.080> measure<00:04:52.320> for<00:04:52.770> you<00:04:52.979> so

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
bring some interim measure for you so

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.070 
bring some interim measure for you so
that<00:04:53.430> you<00:04:53.580> could<00:04:53.760> get<00:04:53.910> some<00:04:54.090> fuel<00:04:54.300> economy<00:04:54.870> now

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
that you could get some fuel economy now

that you could get some fuel economy now
this<00:04:55.860> is<00:04:56.070> not<00:04:56.430> as<00:04:56.669> good<00:04:57.120> as<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.389> pre-ignition

00:04:58.189 --> 00:04:58.199 
this is not as good as the pre-ignition
