certain total energy usage the on their
way<00:05:37.440> to<00:05:37.470> per<00:05:37.740> capita<00:05:38.190> Glenn<00:05:38.340> because<00:05:38.669> they<00:05:39.539> did

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
way to per capita Glenn because they did

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:41.870 
way to per capita Glenn because they did
they're<00:05:40.229> doing<00:05:40.530> it<00:05:40.710> so<00:05:41.250> quickly<00:05:41.580> they're

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
they're doing it so quickly they're

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.879 
they're doing it so quickly they're
rapidly<00:05:42.300> increasing<00:05:43.260> the<00:05:43.349> above<00:05:43.530> ok<00:05:43.710> good

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:43.889 
rapidly increasing the above ok good

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:45.379 
rapidly increasing the above ok good
problem<00:05:44.310> they<00:05:44.430> have<00:05:44.520> an<00:05:44.610> energy<00:05:44.789> problem<00:05:45.300> but

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
problem they have an energy problem but

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.629 
problem they have an energy problem but
they're<00:05:45.510> solving<00:05:45.900> it<00:05:46.250> something<00:05:47.250> better<00:05:47.460> than

00:05:47.629 --> 00:05:47.639 
they're solving it something better than

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.719 
they're solving it something better than
we<00:05:47.729> are<00:05:47.760> ok<00:05:48.210> so<00:05:48.539> you<00:05:49.470> have<00:05:49.740> if<00:05:50.070> you<00:05:50.280> take<00:05:50.550> out

00:05:50.719 --> 00:05:50.729 
we are ok so you have if you take out

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:53.600 
we are ok so you have if you take out
energy<00:05:51.060> it's<00:05:51.720> not<00:05:51.840> just<00:05:52.139> gasoline<00:05:52.650> I<00:05:52.830> have<00:05:53.580> a

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:53.610 
energy it's not just gasoline I have a

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:55.670 
energy it's not just gasoline I have a

friend who's jon huntsman he has the big

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.589 
friend who's jon huntsman he has the big
chemical<00:05:55.830> plant<00:05:56.280> he<00:05:56.789> told<00:05:56.970> me<00:05:57.060> he<00:05:57.120> said<00:05:57.389> Glenn

00:05:57.589 --> 00:05:57.599 
chemical plant he told me he said Glenn

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.010 
chemical plant he told me he said Glenn
you<00:05:58.199> use<00:05:58.470> oil<00:05:58.860> in<00:05:59.159> the<00:05:59.520> in<00:05:59.789> the<00:05:59.849> tablets<00:06:00.780> that

how<00:06:15.150> about<00:06:15.180> polyester<00:06:16.310> energy<00:06:17.310> oil<00:06:17.340> oil<00:06:17.729> it's

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
how about polyester energy oil oil it's

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.870 
how about polyester energy oil oil it's
almost<00:06:18.449> all<00:06:18.659> okay<00:06:19.409> so<00:06:19.889> here's<00:06:20.400> the<00:06:20.520> thing<00:06:20.699> in

the world is changing the world is
changing<00:06:25.860> and<00:06:25.889> you<00:06:26.280> can<00:06:26.460> listen<00:06:26.729> to<00:06:27.530> yourself

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
changing and you can listen to yourself

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:30.469 
changing and you can listen to yourself
in<00:06:28.830> the<00:06:29.039> grocery<00:06:29.430> store<00:06:29.699> or<00:06:29.729> you<00:06:30.120> can<00:06:30.300> listen

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
in the grocery store or you can listen

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.839 
in the grocery store or you can listen
to<00:06:30.750> the<00:06:30.960> people<00:06:31.139> in<00:06:31.380> Washington<00:06:31.440> now<00:06:32.370> maybe

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:32.849 
to the people in Washington now maybe

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:35.060 
to the people in Washington now maybe
they're<00:06:33.090> right<00:06:33.300> maybe<00:06:34.020> in<00:06:34.260> the<00:06:34.289> end<00:06:34.440> this<00:06:34.860> all

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
they're right maybe in the end this all

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:36.290 
they're right maybe in the end this all
goes<00:06:35.279> away<00:06:35.400> and<00:06:35.550> this<00:06:35.669> just<00:06:35.849> a<00:06:35.909> little<00:06:35.940> spike

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:36.300 
goes away and this just a little spike

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.629 
goes away and this just a little spike
maybe<00:06:36.630> they're<00:06:36.810> right<00:06:37.310> but<00:06:38.310> we're<00:06:38.490> talking

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 
maybe they're right but we're talking

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:39.769 
maybe they're right but we're talking
about<00:06:38.940> the<00:06:39.000> future<00:06:39.180> of<00:06:39.300> our<00:06:39.389> country<00:06:39.599> and

00:06:39.769 --> 00:06:39.779 
about the future of our country and

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:41.899 
about the future of our country and
we're<00:06:39.930> talking<00:06:40.020> about<00:06:40.260> our<00:06:40.440> children<00:06:41.010> so<00:06:41.760> now

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
we're talking about our children so now

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:45.080 
we're talking about our children so now
what<00:06:42.300> do<00:06:42.599> you<00:06:42.810> do<00:06:43.139> about<00:06:43.440> it<00:06:43.650> not<00:06:44.310> that<00:06:44.639> the<00:06:44.880> big
