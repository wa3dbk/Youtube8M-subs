00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:13.740
 hello and welcome once again today 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.890
 let's talk about how to play the major scale 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.710
 when the root of the tone begins in the 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.400
 current sixth 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.939
 let's take for example the accordÃ© de sol 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.939
 higher 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:34.590
 if you look closely the remembered of sun 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:38.579
 Major has a root on the sixth string 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:41.400
 third fret is therefore the root of the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.829
 godo the beginning of the major scale 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.769
 on the sixth string 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:50.839
 the equation to play the major scale 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:56.039
 is the next one we start at the root of 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:01:00.479
 the scale in this case sun and we move 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:03.689
 a tone towards the iss of the we move 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:07.439
 towards himself that is another tone in the this time 

00:01:03.689 --> 00:01:12.200
 on the fifth string and desi towards two we 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:16.950
 we move a semitone going to the other tone 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:22.380
 of network am and now on the fourth string is 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:25.409
 one tone and from my extended step is another 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.840
 tone and finally from the seventh and 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.909
 seventh note that we are playing in the 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.030
 scale to return to start another 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:35.180
 back in time that is the eighth 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:38.210
 it's a semitone 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:41.780
 from Abidjan we have a zoom in the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.910
 fourth string and others are in the sixth 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:51.340
 rope the distance in total are from 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.340
 intervals are eight intervals 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.369
 8 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.619
 what we recognize as an octave and 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.479
 we can continue to keep touching 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.920
 down because we still have space 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.190
 here in this position that we are 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.700
 touching then we move a tone to 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.700
 zelaya 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:20.609
 we can not another tone other means of 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:20.609
 this case half tone other tone 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.109
 another tone half tone 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:39.820
 he would listen to himself good and as yet 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.040
 we have space 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.230
 let's continue as usual 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.230
 they taught the scale 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.690
 we play it until we finish all 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.840
 the positions on that scale so we 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:56.440
 there is still one here that would be the and 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:59.849
 we return to the sun because the way that 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.849
 we will touch would be this one 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.129
 nothing 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.640
 and we can go back up 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.299
 and we have one more 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.020
 for sustained and there we end up in 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.209
 well I hope this video is 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.390
 helping to understand a little more 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:35.120
 about the major scale we just 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.240
 talk about how we can play when the 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.350
 root d 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.650
 the tone of the chord or scale begins 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.930
 in the sixth rope many fats and 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.930
