00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 hello everyone my name is happy lion 777 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.470
 and then I do this jailbreak tutorial 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.269
 tethered for you to do what 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.150
 worth to do it in this way because 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.879
 my mic was damaged but empezemos 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.220
 here in the video description them 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:20.310
 I'll leave the link to download it and this one 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:24.180
 I will leave you a rar file which 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.180
 decompress normally 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.300
 they will open a folder and open it and look 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.470
 that the files for this case are 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.470
 the same in windows 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:54.329
 they execute it and wait for it to be extracted 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.729
 everything as you see wait may be 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.039
 it took this process but it 's nothing 

00:00:56.729 --> 00:01:01.879
 bad what it means is that it is 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.879
 creating the program 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.100
 or not 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.490
 colour 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.770
 When finished, they will create another folder 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.770
 which will absinthe to win open it 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.650
 now different files will come out and 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.430
 they do not touch any since that is what we 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:27.290
 allows to unlock our and device 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:29.960
 they open the absinthe program and this one 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.899
 right click obviously to the file 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.899
 synth give properties and seek 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.210
 compatibility tab there look for the one 

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.670
 Say compatible with win xp and the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.440
 they select then they give apply and 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.660
 to accept 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.850
 now they run the program as 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.420
 administrator and they will leave the following 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.420
 screen 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:54.909
 collect their ditto and they will be recognized 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.640
 device if it does not appear means 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:00.340
 that does not work when you recognize it, they click 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.180
 in jailbreak and expect this if it takes 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:07.119
 and I recommend you do not move anything 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.860
 click the jailbreak 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.759
