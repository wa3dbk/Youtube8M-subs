 of if I will be able to see you all high 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.360
 that climb up hates face shit comes from 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.650
 my cousin who supposes his Colombian with the 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.600
 9 how big this 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.890
 and it's worth my thought was thing is that 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.300
 you told me that if you go to 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.860
 to do the photos with me and others do not 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.330
 can be with me because many do not 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.060

 you all have or do not have anyone 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.010
 because I think it's good, although there are people 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.230
 that he has no money and I think they have the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.060
 same the same right perhaps to know 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.220
 less than another that in this case has 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.420
 money I think money moves you 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.370
 things in the world that should not 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:04.870
 move them like that but good I'll see what 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.030

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.390
 Many people know me because I will go out and

 You can see what's in Chile 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.410

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.230

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.000

 next for another federal a calculation 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.070
 between languages ​​a parkour inside should 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.990
 look at the three I'm interested if the one 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.620

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.450

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.650
 end thanks for playing I had the time it was 

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.700
 short for my first map to is not because 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.740
 you liked a greeting to the day 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.970
 following 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.800
 and let's read what comes to be the 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.720
 private question ask and have a 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.610
 map of goku versus naruto if I do not 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.870
 I liked it if I would not like to make a map 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.310
 of that I put a private question for 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.170
 do not steal the idea I know it's a 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:51.630
 selfish pressuring a great idea occurred 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.980
 well it's really this one I'm going to 

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:54.930
 post this question that you have put me 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.150
 with the question of private question more than 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.350
 nothing because I have already made that map 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.760
 but come on if you do not want to do it then 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.990
 my problem in the case that is more 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.790
 total effect 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.810
 I upload it the same and if not then you 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.160
 need that there are many more 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:09.870
 characters apart from why an adult 

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:12.480
 how can that sub be a cell 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.650
 freezer the whole subject of king cabbage that 

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.210
 the dragon series is now appearing 

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.350
 ball z of flight without more but has 

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.760
 liked is that he is leaving the ones that 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.110
 liked from these comments half is 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.910
 very much and that also the map though 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.310
 has been short I liked it and 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.660
 well the thing is that although the maps in 

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.340
 short if they are well made there 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.500
 love playing them and apart from having their 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.940
 part thanks to water without the vital rhythm 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.950
 that I liked a lot so we 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.300
 we see a hug and until the next 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:35.300
 life as I have the arm
