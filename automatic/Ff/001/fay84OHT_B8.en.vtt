00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:06.640
 Let's see 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:08.619
 very bad breath 

00:00:08.619 --> 00:00:11.219
 and they are not reciprocated 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.389
 but what is more painful 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.349
 is to love someone 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:17.370
 and never against the value for 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.349
 to tell that person what you feel 

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:21.759
 maybe god 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:24.939
 he wants us to meet a few wrong people 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:29.029
 before meeting the right person 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.930
 when we know it 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.970
 let us be grateful for that wonderful gift 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.950
 one of the saddest things in life 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.950
 and when you meet someone who means everything 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.990
 and only at the end 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:48.310
 It was mind that it was not for you 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.310
 and you have to let it go 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.130
 when the door of happiness closes 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.490
 another door opens 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:58.910
 but sometimes 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.910
 let's look at that door that closed for so long 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.760
 if we do not see the one that has opened in front of us 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.870
 it's true that we do not know what we have 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.660
 until we lose 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.920
 but it is also true 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.920
 that we do not know what we've been missing 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.800
 until we find it 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.540
 Give someone your love 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.830
 It's never an insurance that they will love you back 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.080
 but the technician who amen back 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.020
 just hope that Christian love 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.930
 in the other person's heart 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.370
 but if you do not believe 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:39.770
 be happy 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.770
 because he grew up in tourism 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.110
 there are things you would love to live that never heard from the person you 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.410
 I would like you to light them 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.000
 but do not be so deaf 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.840
 so as not to hear 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.840
 from the one that tells you from your heart 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.410
 never give up 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:01.410
 if you feel like you can keep fighting 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.150
 never tell a person that there is nothing more 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.150
 if you can not 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.989
 I reached the one who waits 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.369
 although they have not disappointed 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:15.449
 to the one who still believe 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:17.909
 even if it has been betrayed 

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:20.889
 to the one who still needs to love 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.539
 although before that he has been hurt 

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:25.059
 and has acquired 

00:02:25.059 --> 00:02:28.979
 who has the courage and faith to build trust again 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:32.619
 the principle of love 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:35.779
 is to let those we know in themselves 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.479
 and do not try to flip them with our own image 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:41.749
 because then 

00:02:41.749 --> 00:02:44.969
 we will only love the reflection of ourselves in them 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:48.039
 it's not from the outside 

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:49.939
 this type of italy 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.969
 do not go for the riches 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:55.249
 that is lost 

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:58.129
 I go for the inti that makes you smile 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.189
 because it takes just a smile 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:04.189
 to be a dark prison day 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.099
 I hope you find that person that makes you smile 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.819
 There are moments 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.939
 in which you miss a person so 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.159
 who wants to get it out 

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:19.639
 and embrace her with all your strength 

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:22.639
 and I think it's a record and if someone special 

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:25.559
 dream that wants soria 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:27.609
 nor where do you want to go 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.849
 I know what he wants to do 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.789
 because you have only one life 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:33.859
 and an opportunity 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:36.859
 to do everything you want to do 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:39.129
 I hope you have 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.099
 Enough happiness 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:42.899
 to be sweet 

00:03:42.899 --> 00:03:46.109
 enough evidence to make you strong 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.929
 enough pain 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:50.129
 to keep you human 

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.459
 enough hope 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.949
 to be happy 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:56.799
 the happiest people 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.279
 they do not always have the best of everything 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:02.399
 they only get the best out of everything they find on their way 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:05.579
 the happiness 

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.709
 I wait for those who cry 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.929
 those who have been hurt 

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:11.849
 those who do not 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:13.989
 those who try 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.919
 because only they 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:19.959
 can appreciate the importance of the people who have touched their lives 

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:22.279
 love 

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:24.479
 start with a smile 

00:04:24.479 --> 00:04:26.490
 I grew up with a kiss 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.789
 and very well with a 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:31.580
 the brightness of the future 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.029
 It will always be based on a past 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:37.240
 you can not go happy for life 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.699
 until difficult your past failures and the colors of your heart 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:43.770
 when you were born 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.559
 tullo given 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:48.270
 and everyone around would smile 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.009
 live your life 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:52.629
 so that when 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:55.229
 you smile 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.050
 all to the king
