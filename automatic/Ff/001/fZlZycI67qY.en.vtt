00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:24.020 
to create a little animation here

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:26.560 
to create a little animation here
biology<00:05:24.740> that<00:05:25.580> would<00:05:25.820> just<00:05:25.940> keep<00:05:26.060> it<00:05:26.270> here<00:05:26.510> for

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
biology that would just keep it here for

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:34.060 
biology that would just keep it here for
that<00:05:26.900> on<00:05:27.050> that<00:05:27.400> go<00:05:28.400> ahead<00:05:28.639> and<00:05:29.080> move<00:05:30.080> that<00:05:33.070> this

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
that on that go ahead and move that this

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:43.240 
that on that go ahead and move that this
go<00:05:34.280> around<00:05:34.430> here<00:05:40.449> and<00:05:41.449> there<00:05:42.289> is<00:05:42.590> like<00:05:42.889> this

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
go around here and there is like this

00:05:43.250 --> 00:06:02.279 
go around here and there is like this
boat<00:05:43.520> here<00:05:59.979> which<00:06:00.979> is<00:06:01.130> kind<00:06:01.340> of<00:06:01.370> like<00:06:01.490> a<00:06:01.639> little

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
boat here which is kind of like a little

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.800 
boat here which is kind of like a little
jumping<00:06:03.289> forward<00:06:03.620> won't<00:06:04.010> again<00:06:04.510> you<00:06:05.510> notice

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:05.810 
jumping forward won't again you notice

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.129 
jumping forward won't again you notice
that<00:06:05.960> it<00:06:06.349> does<00:06:06.620> it<00:06:06.830> automatically<00:06:08.080> you<00:06:09.080> can

00:06:09.129 --> 00:06:09.139 
that it does it automatically you can

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:11.140 
that it does it automatically you can
also<00:06:09.349> use<00:06:09.500> bones<00:06:09.949> for<00:06:10.280> machinery<00:06:10.699> could

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:11.150 
also use bones for machinery could

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.350 
also use bones for machinery could
subject<00:06:12.010> all<00:06:13.010> right<00:06:13.159> well<00:06:13.760> that's<00:06:14.030> it<00:06:14.180> for

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 
subject all right well that's it for

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.990 
subject all right well that's it for
this<00:06:14.510> video<00:06:15.080> here<00:06:15.560> little<00:06:16.220> animation<00:06:16.729> for<00:06:16.880> you

actually<00:06:26.329> planted<00:06:26.869> on<00:06:27.019> creating<00:06:27.739> characters

00:06:28.799 --> 00:06:28.809 
actually planted on creating characters

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:31.509 
actually planted on creating characters
does<00:06:29.809> a<00:06:30.199> debate<00:06:30.649> them<00:06:30.919> which<00:06:31.159> I'll<00:06:31.339> actually
