00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.820
 today we present you the lg of three one of 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.439
 the most anticipated terminals of 2014 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.270
 after the good reviews of g2 the 

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:18.310
 company has decided to continue with what 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.289
 it became a hit the body 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:22.720
 of the g3 stands out for being really 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.700
 Ergonomic and comfortable on the hand despite 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.270
 incorporate a screen 5.5 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.850
 inches 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.260
 to achieve it they have reduced everything 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.330
 possible the frames of the screen 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.550
 allowing a larger panel than in 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.620
 other terminals of similar size by 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.300
 On the other hand the new back material makes 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.260
 that has good grip in the hand and 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.899
 that way avoid unintentional falls 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.030
 in the back we will find the 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.460
 lock buttons and volume that as I already 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.750
 we saw in the g2 they ended up being comfortable already 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.030
 that our fingers are placed 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.710
 naturally the touch of the buttons 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.739
 has improved and now it's easier 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:59.350
 distinguish which is which one aesthetically 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.449
 the g3 has also improved although the 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.129
 lines are similar to those of axis 2 the 

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.379
 sensations of a more premium terminal 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.840
 without sacrificing the weight or the thickness of the 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.460
 smartphone is also available in 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:13.430
 white black and gold 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.650
 the g2 screen was already good but the 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.320
 of the g3 is at another level it is a 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.770
 55-inch ips panel with resolution 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.630
 qhd contrast saturation levels 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.790
 and brightness are pretty good 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.830
 well above average all this 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.300
 combined with its resolution makes the 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.300
 experience of use be magnificent 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.630
 another improved point is the camera 3 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.060
 megapixel stabilizer improved and of 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.160
 fragma of 2.4 efe make the 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.080
 performance is really good at 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.340
 most of the situation in good light the 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.229
 level of detail in the pictures is 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.930
 excellent with good white balance 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.580
 contrast and saturation in low light the 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.410
 stabilizer goes into action and gives us 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.940
 some luminous photos although not very 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:58.000
 detailed due to the reduction of 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:00.430
 noise the double flash is in addition to button 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.400
 which will improve the color balance in 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.840
 situations where we do the greatest 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.789
 newness of the camera is the system in 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.009
 focusing laser that turns out to be quite a 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:10.869
 right the approach is fast and accurate 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.550
 even in situations where others 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.770
 terminals will have difficulties with the 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.410
 traditional approach system as 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.510
 to video the g3 allows us to record at 4k and 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:22.630
 30 frames per second plus up 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.680
 120 frames per second at 720 p for 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.450
 make slow motion 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.360
 as with the photos the result is 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.100
 quite pretty good and the application 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.780
 of the camera is simple and we can do 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.580
 photos simply by clicking on the 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.950
 screen or access advanced mode 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:40.290
 where will we find options for hdr 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.290
 automatic selective focus and panoramas 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.360
 g3 speaker is now part 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.970
 back which means it's easy to 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.370
 cover on certain surfaces however 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.590
 it has a little seen power and quality 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.620
 in such small speakers other than true 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.600
 the mark inside the g3 carries a 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.430
 3000 milliamp battery that gives you 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.710
 a really satisfactory autonomy 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.540
 intensive users can reach the 

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.100
 end of the day without problems while 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.740
 the rest of users will be able to reach 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.450
 up to 2 days of use the layer of 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.180
 customization of the g3 has been 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.830
 simplified and aesthetically improved 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.540
 everything is more fluid and attractive thanks 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.600
 to the use of a new color palette and 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:20.620
 with the most flat and minimalist lines 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.300
 It also has very useful features 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.950
 interesting like the knock code or the 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.140
 possibility of using two applications to 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.340
 the time without a doubt the shaft has made a good 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.049
 work in the software section 

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:34.599
 all the power of g3 comes hand in hand 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:37.120
 of a subject with 801 to 2.5 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:40.060
 gigahertz and 2 gigabytes of ram 16 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.040
 internal gigabytes and microsd slot a 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.740
 good combination that makes everything 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.260
 move like silk 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.970
 The g3 clearly represents the vision 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.460
 of the axis for the telephony market 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:52.870
 mobile is a complete smartphone and 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.990
 versatile that will meet the 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.190
 needs of almost all users 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:57.880
 this does not mean that it comes out smartphone 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.310
 perfect 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.110
 none is, but without a doubt the 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.240
 stress comes close to it 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:08.040
 choosing has again demonstrated in what 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.040
 is capable more forcefully than ever
