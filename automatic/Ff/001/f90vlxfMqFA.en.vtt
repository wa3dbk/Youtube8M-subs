pen strokes that you can see will test

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.019 
pen strokes that you can see will test
the<00:00:26.010> speed<00:00:27.890> they're<00:00:28.890> appearing<00:00:29.250> on<00:00:29.429> screen<00:00:29.849> as

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029

the speed they're appearing on screen as
fast<00:00:30.269> as<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:30.599> can<00:00:30.660> draw<00:00:31.019> them<00:00:33.980> now<00:00:34.980> it<00:00:35.070> kind<00:00:35.309> of

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
fast as I can draw them now it kind of

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.580 
fast as I can draw them now it kind of
depends<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.760> where<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.090> have<00:00:36.239> your<00:00:36.590> wireless

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
depends on where you have your wireless

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.680 
depends on where you have your wireless
receiver<00:00:38.040> it's<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.460> little<00:00:38.640> USB<00:00:38.910> receiver<00:00:39.450> that

receiver it's a little USB receiver that

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.380 
receiver it's a little USB receiver that
you<00:00:39.780> plug<00:00:39.989> in<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.469> if<00:00:40.950> it's<00:00:41.160> way<00:00:41.850> behind<00:00:42.239> your

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
you plug in and if it's way behind your

computer and is obstructed by a bunch of

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.369 
computer and is obstructed by a bunch of
stuff<00:00:45.360> it's<00:00:45.539> probably<00:00:45.629> not<00:00:45.870> going<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.050> work<00:00:46.200> as

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
stuff it's probably not going to work as

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.639 
stuff it's probably not going to work as
well<00:00:46.590> as<00:00:46.829> if<00:00:46.980> it's<00:00:47.180> got<00:00:48.180> some<00:00:48.960> space<00:00:49.200> for<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
well as if it's got some space for the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.279 
well as if it's got some space for the
signal<00:00:50.039> travel<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.510> wireless<00:00:51.719> doesn't

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
signal travel if the wireless doesn't

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.290 
signal travel if the wireless doesn't
work<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.010> well<00:00:53.129> for<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.699> can<00:00:53.850> also<00:00:54.000> just

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
work so well for you you can also just

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.060 
work so well for you you can also just
plug<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.629> in<00:00:54.719> through<00:00:54.899> USB<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.559> it<00:00:55.620> works<00:00:55.770> fine

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
plug it in through USB and it works fine

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.830
