we inhale oxygen from well all air from

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.650 
we inhale oxygen from well all air from
the<00:00:25.380> outside<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:27.000> area<00:00:27.269> through<00:00:27.570> here

your sinuses start the process of both
filtering<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.099> air<00:00:32.250> and<00:00:32.780> warming<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.899> and

epiglottis is a hinged piece of
cartilage<00:01:07.530> that<00:01:07.680> will<00:01:08.070> flip<00:01:08.670> downward<00:01:09.390> to

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
cover the trachea when we're swallowing

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.499 
cover the trachea when we're swallowing
food<00:01:12.990> this<00:01:13.799> prevents<00:01:14.310> food<00:01:14.580> from<00:01:15.030> going<00:01:15.150> down

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
food this prevents food from going down

a structure that has two folds of

elastic tissue attached to cartilage
that<00:01:40.090> vibrates<00:01:40.869> and<00:01:41.400> allows<00:01:42.400> us<00:01:42.430> to<00:01:42.729> produce

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
that vibrates and allows us to produce

the trachea is a cartilage reinforced

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.340 
the trachea is a cartilage reinforced
tube<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.840> carries<00:01:53.410> air<00:01:54.040> down<00:01:54.670> into<00:01:55.570> the

tube that carries air down into the
lungs<00:01:56.759> now<00:01:57.759> the<00:01:57.820> reason<00:01:58.360> that<00:01:58.390> it's

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:58.660 
lungs now the reason that it's

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:02.160 
lungs now the reason that it's
reinforced<00:01:59.380> with<00:01:59.680> cartilage<00:02:00.130> is<00:02:00.750> because<00:02:01.750> the

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
reinforced with cartilage is because the

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.350 
reinforced with cartilage is because the
pressure<00:02:02.530> difference<00:02:03.130> would<00:02:03.610> cause<00:02:03.910> our

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360 
pressure difference would cause our

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.900 
pressure difference would cause our
trachea<00:02:05.020> to<00:02:05.080> collapse<00:02:05.680> when<00:02:06.550> we<00:02:06.640> tried<00:02:06.880> to

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
trachea to collapse when we tried to

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:11.010 
trachea to collapse when we tried to
inhale<00:02:07.539> if<00:02:08.110> it<00:02:08.440> did<00:02:08.619> not<00:02:08.649> have<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:10.020> cartilage

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
inhale if it did not have the cartilage

breathing<00:03:53.420> remember<00:03:54.420> when<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:54.750> diaphragm

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.380 
breathing remember when the diaphragm

00:03:55.380 --> 00:04:02.340 
breathing remember when the diaphragm
contracts<00:03:56.180> it<00:03:57.180> moves<00:03:57.540> downward
