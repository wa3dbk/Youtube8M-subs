with<00:03:46.989> this<00:03:47.110> program<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.800> think<00:03:48.519> about<00:03:48.640> when<00:03:48.850> I

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 
with this program I think about when I

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.880 
with this program I think about when I
go<00:03:49.120> to<00:03:49.150> a<00:03:49.239> grocery<00:03:49.450> store<00:03:49.690> if<00:03:50.080> I<00:03:50.230> see<00:03:50.500> love<00:03:50.680> like

green<00:03:54.470> green<00:03:54.770> bananas<00:03:55.250> I<00:03:55.370> probably<00:03:55.730> will<00:03:55.910> buy

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
green green bananas I probably will buy

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.210

yellowish-brown bananas I probably won't

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.699 
yellowish-brown bananas I probably won't
buy<00:03:59.840> and<00:03:59.990> there's<00:04:00.140> somewhere<00:04:00.380> in<00:04:00.560> between

that<00:04:01.130> I'll<00:04:01.280> buy<00:04:01.430> them<00:04:01.700> I<00:04:01.910> guess<00:04:02.720> I'm<00:04:02.900> not<00:04:02.930> alone

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
that I'll buy them I guess I'm not alone

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.960 
that I'll buy them I guess I'm not alone
in<00:04:03.560> that<00:04:03.680> is<00:04:03.830> what<00:04:03.950> you're<00:04:04.100> saying<00:04:04.250> not<00:04:04.700> at<00:04:04.850> all

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
in that is what you're saying not at all

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.640 
in that is what you're saying not at all
and<00:04:05.209> that<00:04:05.240> then<00:04:05.510> that's<00:04:05.600> a<00:04:05.780> fine<00:04:06.020> line<00:04:06.290> getting

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:06.650 
and that then that's a fine line getting

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.440 
and that then that's a fine line getting
them<00:04:06.860> to<00:04:07.010> that<00:04:07.160> exact<00:04:07.490> color<00:04:07.760> that<00:04:08.240> you<00:04:08.270> want

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
them to that exact color that you want

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.150 
them to that exact color that you want
so<00:04:09.110> some<00:04:09.319> are<00:04:09.380> going<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:09.590> be<00:04:09.709> a<00:04:09.740> little<00:04:09.860> bit<00:04:10.040> too
