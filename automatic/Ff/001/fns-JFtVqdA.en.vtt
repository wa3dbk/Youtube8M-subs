to<00:00:19.170> make<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.439> pretty<00:00:19.710> simple<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.220> get<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> base

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
to make is pretty simple I get a base

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.140 
to make is pretty simple I get a base
piece<00:00:21.090> then<00:00:21.630> I<00:00:21.869> post<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.119> then<00:00:24.119> the

piece then I post and then the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.890 
piece then I post and then the
microphone<00:00:24.539> and<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.730> just<00:00:26.730> gets<00:00:26.970> mounted<00:00:27.240> into

it on with glue stick I also mark the
location<00:05:05.199> for<00:05:05.410> the<00:05:05.530> post<00:05:05.770> and<00:05:06.070> I<00:05:06.340> punch

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
location for the post and I punch

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:15.840 
location for the post and I punch
through<00:05:06.820> it<00:05:13.080> then<00:05:14.080> I<00:05:14.260> cut<00:05:14.680> it<00:05:14.710> out<00:05:15.100> roughly<00:05:15.669> on

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
through it then I cut it out roughly on

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.680 
through it then I cut it out roughly on
the<00:05:15.880> band's<00:05:16.270> own

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:19.690 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.410 

so<00:05:20.260> to<00:05:20.320> shape<00:05:20.650> it<00:05:20.830> on<00:05:21.040> the<00:05:21.190> disk<00:05:21.400> sander

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:25.420 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:31.770 

and<00:05:26.160> smooth<00:05:27.160> it<00:05:27.190> by<00:05:27.700> and<00:05:28.330> I<00:05:30.090> also<00:05:31.090> gave<00:05:31.450> it<00:05:31.480> a

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
and smooth it by and I also gave it a

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:39.690 
and smooth it by and I also gave it a
simple<00:05:32.170> profile<00:05:32.590> around<00:05:32.920> the<00:05:33.130> edge

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:43.680 

and<00:05:41.220> finish<00:05:42.220> it<00:05:42.250> with<00:05:42.550> the<00:05:42.730> same<00:05:42.970> hardwood<00:05:43.450> oil

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
and finish it with the same hardwood oil

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.420 
and finish it with the same hardwood oil
it<00:05:43.990> really<00:05:44.380> brings<00:05:44.650> out<00:05:44.830> the<00:05:44.890> wood<00:05:45.160> color

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:47.430 
it really brings out the wood color

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:50.670 
it really brings out the wood color
now<00:05:48.430> with<00:05:48.610> the<00:05:48.760> pieces<00:05:49.120> finished<00:05:49.300> I<00:05:49.690> can<00:05:50.260> mount

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680 
now with the pieces finished I can mount

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.680 
now with the pieces finished I can mount
them<00:05:50.920> together<00:05:51.100> and<00:05:51.550> first<00:05:52.210> I'm<00:05:52.450> going<00:05:52.600> to

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:52.690 
them together and first I'm going to

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:54.900 
them together and first I'm going to
drill<00:05:52.930> the<00:05:53.050> hole<00:05:53.230> that<00:05:53.710> will<00:05:53.860> fit<00:05:54.160> this<00:05:54.550> tenon

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
drill the hole that will fit this tenon

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.240 
drill the hole that will fit this tenon
of<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.180> post<00:05:55.420> to<00:05:56.140> make<00:05:56.320> sure<00:05:56.560> I<00:05:56.770> don't<00:05:56.830> grow

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
of the post to make sure I don't grow

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.610 
of the post to make sure I don't grow
through<00:05:57.580> the<00:05:57.700> bottom<00:05:58.090> I<00:05:58.270> gonna<00:05:59.170> use<00:05:59.410> my

00:05:59.610 --> 00:05:59.620 
through the bottom I gonna use my

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:01.410 
through the bottom I gonna use my
digital<00:05:59.830> readout<00:06:00.370> on<00:06:00.400> a<00:06:00.610> drill<00:06:00.880> press<00:06:00.910> and

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420 
digital readout on a drill press and

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.400 
digital readout on a drill press and
this<00:06:01.660> tells<00:06:01.960> me<00:06:02.080> to<00:06:03.070> stop<00:06:03.760> at<00:06:04.200> fifty<00:06:05.200> four

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
this tells me to stop at fifty four

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:08.850 
this tells me to stop at fifty four
millimeter<00:06:06.100> I<00:06:06.310> could<00:06:06.940> also<00:06:07.180> use<00:06:07.390> my<00:06:07.960> desktop

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:08.860 
millimeter I could also use my desktop

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.400 
millimeter I could also use my desktop
but<00:06:09.160> the<00:06:09.340> digital<00:06:09.670> readout<00:06:10.030> is<00:06:10.270> simpler<00:06:11.170> and

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:11.410 
but the digital readout is simpler and

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:17.570 
but the digital readout is simpler and
more<00:06:11.650> accurate

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:17.580 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.430 

right<00:06:18.180> now<00:06:18.330> the<00:06:18.390> doll<00:06:18.690> is<00:06:18.900> a<00:06:18.930> little<00:06:19.200> bit<00:06:19.320> too

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:19.440 
right now the doll is a little bit too

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.100 
right now the doll is a little bit too
long<00:06:19.620> but<00:06:20.190> I<00:06:20.220> did<00:06:20.460> this<00:06:20.580> on<00:06:20.730> purpose<00:06:20.840> so<00:06:21.840> now<00:06:22.080> I

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
long but I did this on purpose so now I

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.030 
long but I did this on purpose so now I
can<00:06:22.380> cut<00:06:22.770> it<00:06:22.890> to<00:06:22.920> the<00:06:23.130> right<00:06:23.340> length

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:26.040 

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.980 

to<00:06:26.550> make<00:06:26.700> sure<00:06:26.880> that<00:06:27.120> this<00:06:27.330> microphone<00:06:27.780> holder

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:27.990 
to make sure that this microphone holder

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.170 
to make sure that this microphone holder
has<00:06:28.200> the<00:06:28.320> right<00:06:28.470> position<00:06:28.980> here<00:06:29.280> I<00:06:29.430> first<00:06:30.000> have

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
has the right position here I first have

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.300 
has the right position here I first have
to<00:06:30.240> assemble<00:06:30.810> it<00:06:30.930> and<00:06:31.110> then<00:06:31.560> glue<00:06:31.770> the<00:06:31.920> poster

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:32.310 
to assemble it and then glue the poster

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.360 
to assemble it and then glue the poster
place<00:06:32.660> so<00:06:33.660> first<00:06:34.080> screen<00:06:34.470> in<00:06:34.650> this<00:06:34.860> piece<00:06:35.130> here

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:35.370 
place so first screen in this piece here

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.570 
place so first screen in this piece here
and<00:06:36.500> because<00:06:37.500> I'm<00:06:37.650> lazy<00:06:37.890> I<00:06:38.040> use<00:06:38.310> a<00:06:38.340> drill<00:06:40.580> now

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
and because I'm lazy I use a drill now

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:48.410 
and because I'm lazy I use a drill now
screwing<00:06:42.000> this<00:06:42.270> into<00:06:42.930> the<00:06:43.080> holder<00:06:43.500> and<00:06:47.390> now<00:06:48.390> I

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:48.420 
screwing this into the holder and now I

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.050 
screwing this into the holder and now I
can<00:06:48.750> verify<00:06:48.990> the<00:06:49.320> right<00:06:49.620> position<00:06:50.190> and<00:06:50.340> glue

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:51.060 
can verify the right position and glue

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:59.000 
can verify the right position and glue
it<00:06:51.210> in<00:06:51.450> a<00:06:56.990> single<00:06:57.990> clamp<00:06:58.230> holds<00:06:58.680> everything

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
it in a single clamp holds everything

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.660 
it in a single clamp holds everything
secure<00:06:59.610> while<00:06:59.880> the<00:07:00.030> glue<00:07:00.210> dries

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:01.670 
secure while the glue dries

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:06.440 
secure while the glue dries
and<00:07:04.220> there<00:07:05.220> it<00:07:05.340> is<00:07:05.460> finished<00:07:05.820> and<00:07:05.970> ready<00:07:06.360> to

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:06.450 
and there it is finished and ready to

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:08.990 
and there it is finished and ready to
use<00:07:06.600> but<00:07:07.290> I<00:07:07.320> also<00:07:07.590> made<00:07:08.010> this<00:07:08.190> pop<00:07:08.430> screen<00:07:08.730> here

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:09.000 
use but I also made this pop screen here

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.910 
use but I also made this pop screen here
that<00:07:09.480> goes<00:07:09.690> in<00:07:09.840> front<00:07:09.870> of<00:07:10.170> the<00:07:10.260> microphone<00:07:10.770> and

00:07:10.910 --> 00:07:10.920 
that goes in front of the microphone and

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.520 
that goes in front of the microphone and
I<00:07:11.880> make<00:07:12.090> this<00:07:12.240> in<00:07:12.420> another<00:07:12.630> video<00:07:12.990> and<00:07:13.260> you<00:07:13.380> can

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:13.530 
I make this in another video and you can

00:07:13.530 --> 00:07:15.380 
I make this in another video and you can
watch<00:07:13.740> it<00:07:13.770> by<00:07:13.950> clicking<00:07:14.100> this<00:07:14.670> video<00:07:14.970> right

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:15.390 
watch it by clicking this video right

00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:18.890 
watch it by clicking this video right
here<00:07:15.720> as<00:07:16.460> this<00:07:17.460> video<00:07:17.730> it<00:07:17.910> is<00:07:18.030> probably<00:07:18.600> more

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:18.900 
here as this video it is probably more

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:20.840 
here as this video it is probably more
interesting<00:07:19.440> for<00:07:19.650> people<00:07:20.010> who<00:07:20.280> also<00:07:20.640> make

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:20.850 
interesting for people who also make

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.720 
interesting for people who also make
videos<00:07:21.240> and<00:07:21.480> voiceovers<00:07:22.050> themselves<00:07:22.730> but

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:23.730 
videos and voiceovers themselves but

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.000 
videos and voiceovers themselves but
anyways<00:07:24.150> the<00:07:24.720> microphone<00:07:25.200> stand<00:07:25.500> turned<00:07:25.830> out

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.010 
anyways the microphone stand turned out

00:07:26.010 --> 00:07:28.910 
anyways the microphone stand turned out
great<00:07:26.400> and<00:07:26.700> I'm<00:07:26.850> very<00:07:26.970> happy<00:07:27.180> with<00:07:27.480> it<00:07:27.510> and<00:07:27.930> I

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:28.920 
great and I'm very happy with it and I

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:30.440 
great and I'm very happy with it and I
think<00:07:29.190> you<00:07:29.280> can<00:07:29.460> definitely<00:07:29.670> hear<00:07:30.270> a

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:30.450 
think you can definitely hear a

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.210 
think you can definitely hear a
difference<00:07:30.990> in<00:07:31.170> the<00:07:31.260> sound<00:07:31.440> quality<00:07:31.590> between

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 
difference in the sound quality between

00:07:32.220 --> 00:07:34.370 
difference in the sound quality between
this<00:07:32.640> microphone<00:07:33.180> here<00:07:33.420> and<00:07:33.630> the<00:07:34.140> camera

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:34.380 
this microphone here and the camera

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:37.100 
this microphone here and the camera
