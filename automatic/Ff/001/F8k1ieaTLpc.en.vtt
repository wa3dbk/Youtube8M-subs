00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.370
 the girl's mother 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.150
 I came here to teach today to step 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:12.380
 step of this flower is a means of taking 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.790
 let's say right load of 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.340
 first make a ball with black ink 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.300
 This noise is hard here. 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.550
 hence it dry I use this ink 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.769
 of acrilex does not have the 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.519
 of the code for you because it attacked the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:33.120
 common yellow code your use of 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.340
 force in red drawn by orange 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:42.719
 but also erased but it needs to be 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:46.260
 perfect in heaven to vote using was the 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.430
 Best of all I searched for cargo 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:57.559
 double 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:01:00.989
 I use this one that we are always 2012 and 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:06.299
 I adapted the sardine is a bit more 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:12.320
 thin and way better half is already 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:17.040
 yellow half red 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.080
 So you come here and do half 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.640
 I do my job is to make four 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:37.439
 lines that are going to be like four 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:39.479
 petals clean my brush and I'll use the 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.470
 green as it is new has a code for 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:48.869
 You are an acrilex moss green 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:53.119
 513 do little leaf mix trust 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.119
 so great but it is a natural setting 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.610
 of cool sheet loading port or 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.520
 doing so is easier for none 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.340
 video is half the siena half of the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.450
 green with the green down to us 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.450
 make that choice 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.599
 after dry 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.019
 there you will use black to make 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:22.450
 the outline of people I chose 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:26.230
 working with matte acrylic paints 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:30.040
 and how to achieve the nature glues're this 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.959
 brand and also the tri-collar which is great 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.519
 to dry I think working with 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.709
 relation to the double load even with many 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:39.370
 flowers also the other types of connection 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.080
 with the drought right there to make the outline 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.299
 I'm going to use this potential here with us. 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:48.280
 with the potential of 142 2010 I adapted 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:51.239
 his sardines were good too 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.920
 car finines counted 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:03:00.160
 you come jetty tip of here 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:02.200
 brush and will do the contours of these 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.829
 15 in the middle to ride a handsome man 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.829
 in the photo 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.579
 the less they had had continuity 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.680
 in heaven 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:15.519
 the more fininhas and drawing the people 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:18.000
 Paint with the tip of the brush, there you go. 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:18.000
 the outline 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:36.100
 in the end there was and neither does it and so 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:42.780
 People would do it the way it's the black to 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:45.310
 end was pretty much rj is bes 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.170
 have another way of making the sheet 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.060
 I'm going to do it, it's dried up, and China's 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.950
 was accepted very fast 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.109
 is a closed leaf so without 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.459
 this speck you make you do in. 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:56.260
 get out 

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.810
 You'll be doing it outside. 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.569
 inside then she will leave closed 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.200
 so this tip 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:06.639
 al TA will fit the way 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.230
 all the agents are paulo eu 

00:04:06.639 --> 00:04:12.239
 I particularly like the sheet 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.769
 puxadinho and there but it prevents you 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:16.690
 With his talent he made the outside in. 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:17.859
 it gets ugly from the inside to 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.409
 out will keep an eye on 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.270
 look at you clear difference of 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:26.949
 inside out will get much more 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:30.810
 beautiful reviewer besco if you do here do 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:34.060
 miolinho bridges bringing're white 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.919
 Look differences have seen a finish for 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:41.020
 the other is not much more beautiful I 

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:46.770
 I find the following eleven first white 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.770
 to make beautiful flower is very beautiful 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.800
 Good people, that's what I hope you have. 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.800
 liked until the next video
