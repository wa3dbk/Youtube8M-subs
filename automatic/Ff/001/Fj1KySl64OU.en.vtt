00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
apparently it's the same exact shell but

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.759 
apparently it's the same exact shell but
they<00:00:12.389> use<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> different<00:00:12.960> sensor<00:00:13.290> so<00:00:13.469> for<00:00:13.620> this

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
they use a different sensor so for this

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.220 
they use a different sensor so for this
