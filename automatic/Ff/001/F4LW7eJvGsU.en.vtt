00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.460
 One time the bike's brake light began to fail. 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.120
 I disassembled the rear flashlight, took measurements on the electrical wiring 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.180
 and I decided to change the key on the front lever. 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.250
 When I disassembled it, I discovered that the problem was the braced handle support, 

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:45.590
 so the lever did not come into contact with the brake light switch. 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.510
 As you know, almost 90% of the braking of this type bike is by 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.680
 front brake, that is, if I were on a road 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.510
 and had to tighten the lever, it is likely that its support broke 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.370
 and I would be unrestrained at a crucial time. 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.700
 It was certain that the support would have broken in one, or in a sequence of falls that I had, 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.170
 but still I decided to research about it, because this type of problem could lead to death! 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.840
 As we know the cars are made to deform when hit 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.020
 as a way to dampen impact forces to protect occupants. 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:34.750
 This concept of having defined points of rupture or points of deformation to protect other 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.110
 areas is something common in various projects ... 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.509
 including some types of levers. 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.270
 Many riders have joints or areas with less material 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.600
 so that when beating they are broken in these places. 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.579
 In this way they break or deform, but they remain functional because their 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.239
 joints and fixings remain operational. 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.000
 This type of technology began to be developed in motovelocidade 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.250
 because it was common for the pilot to fall, only to break the joint of the lever 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.320
 and not be able to return to the race. Now the lever breaks the tip, but continues 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.580
 running and the rider returns to the track. 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.260
 In my case, I used rigid levers, that is, 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.160
 without break points. With that, in my falls the beats on the lever 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.130
 they threw the force into the joint, causing it to crack. 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.060
 Today I use levers with breaking points ... and in case of new falls I have in mind the 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.300
 need to periodically check the bearing support.
