00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:11.180 
switch as you can see I'm moving the

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.750 
switch as you can see I'm moving the
brake<00:00:11.330> pedal<00:00:12.040> the<00:00:13.040> switches<00:00:13.720> right<00:00:14.720> there<00:00:15.760> and

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
brake pedal the switches right there and

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.050 
brake pedal the switches right there and
the<00:00:17.119> brake<00:00:17.300> pedal<00:00:18.160> has<00:00:19.160> a<00:00:21.430> tiny<00:00:22.430> little<00:00:22.760> hole

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 
the brake pedal has a tiny little hole

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.109 
the brake pedal has a tiny little hole
in<00:00:23.270> it<00:00:23.390> and<00:00:23.539> it<00:00:23.779> looks<00:00:24.020> like<00:00:24.140> there<00:00:24.500> used<00:00:24.710> to<00:00:24.830> be

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:25.119 
in it and it looks like there used to be

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:27.880 
in it and it looks like there used to be
your<00:00:26.119> plastic<00:00:26.600> cover<00:00:26.900> or<00:00:27.230> something<00:00:27.710> else

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
your plastic cover or something else

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.250 
your plastic cover or something else
that<00:00:28.160> went<00:00:28.910> in<00:00:29.029> there<00:00:29.180> to<00:00:29.420> make<00:00:29.600> contact<00:00:30.109> with

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
that went in there to make contact with

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:33.849 
that went in there to make contact with
the<00:00:30.439> brake<00:00:30.619> pedal<00:00:30.920> switch<00:00:31.039> and<00:00:32.079> so<00:00:33.079> now<00:00:33.649> what's

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:33.859 
the brake pedal switch and so now what's

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:36.130 
the brake pedal switch and so now what's
happening<00:00:34.219> is<00:00:34.429> without<00:00:34.850> that<00:00:34.879> little<00:00:35.149> piece

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
happening is without that little piece

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.770 
happening is without that little piece
there<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:37.489> rear<00:00:37.670> brake<00:00:37.909> lights<00:00:38.149> stay<00:00:38.359> on<00:00:38.390> and

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:38.780 
there the rear brake lights stay on and

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.599 
there the rear brake lights stay on and
drains<00:00:39.679> the<00:00:39.859> battery<00:00:40.809> so<00:00:42.100> at<00:00:43.100> first<00:00:43.280> I<00:00:43.489> thought

00:00:43.599 --> 00:00:43.609 
drains the battery so at first I thought

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:45.789 
drains the battery so at first I thought
it<00:00:43.729> was<00:00:43.789> a<00:00:43.879> switch<00:00:44.239> but<00:00:44.559> closer<00:00:45.559> examination

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:45.799 
it was a switch but closer examination

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:51.430 
it was a switch but closer examination
shows<00:00:46.609> that<00:00:46.819> this<00:00:47.389> piece<00:00:47.659> has<00:00:48.350> fallen<00:00:48.679> out<00:00:50.440> so

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
shows that this piece has fallen out so

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.639 
shows that this piece has fallen out so
what<00:00:51.589> I'm<00:00:51.739> going<00:00:52.100> to<00:00:52.159> do<00:00:52.339> is<00:00:53.059> take<00:00:53.780> a<00:00:53.989> 13

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:54.649 
what I'm going to do is take a 13

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:56.709 
what I'm going to do is take a 13
millimeter<00:00:54.799> bolt<00:00:55.339> like<00:00:55.879> this<00:00:56.120> one<00:00:56.299> right<00:00:56.420> here

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
millimeter bolt like this one right here

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.279 
millimeter bolt like this one right here
the<00:00:57.709> lock<00:00:57.949> washer<00:00:58.539> and<00:00:59.539> I'm<00:00:59.629> going<00:00:59.809> to<00:00:59.839> stick

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
the lock washer and I'm going to stick

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.030 
the lock washer and I'm going to stick
it<00:01:00.440> into<00:01:00.649> the<00:01:01.010> brake<00:01:01.159> pedal<00:01:02.289> facing<00:01:03.289> this<00:01:03.979> way

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
it into the brake pedal facing this way

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.740 
it into the brake pedal facing this way
so<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.549> head<00:01:04.699> of<00:01:04.790> the<00:01:04.850> bolt<00:01:04.970> will<00:01:05.390> be<00:01:05.510> facing

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
so the head of the bolt will be facing

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.250 
so the head of the bolt will be facing
towards<00:01:06.110> the<00:01:06.200> driver<00:01:06.440> and<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.970> stem<00:01:08.270> the

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
towards the driver and the stem the

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.350 
towards the driver and the stem the
threaded<00:01:09.620> part<00:01:09.770> will<00:01:09.920> be<00:01:10.070> facing<00:01:10.880> towards<00:01:11.240> the

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:11.360 
threaded part will be facing towards the

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.190 
threaded part will be facing towards the
engine<00:01:11.450> that<00:01:11.900> way<00:01:13.120> when<00:01:14.120> the<00:01:14.540> brake<00:01:14.720> pedal<00:01:15.020> is

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
engine that way when the brake pedal is

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.160 
engine that way when the brake pedal is
released<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:17.330> will<00:01:17.450> make<00:01:17.570> contact<00:01:17.990> with<00:01:18.110> a

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
released it will make contact with a

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.160 
released it will make contact with a
switch<00:01:19.480> shutting<00:01:20.480> off<00:01:20.600> the<00:01:20.630> power<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:21.080> the

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
switch shutting off the power to the

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.070 
switch shutting off the power to the
brake<00:01:21.350> lights<00:01:21.590> so<00:01:22.190> I<00:01:22.480> can<00:01:23.480> film<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:23.870> and<00:01:23.990> do

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
brake lights so I can film it and do

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.770 
brake lights so I can film it and do
both<00:01:24.260> so<00:01:24.560> after<00:01:25.310> I<00:01:25.340> put<00:01:25.550> it<00:01:25.580> in<00:01:25.790> there<00:01:25.940> I<00:01:26.150> will

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
both so after I put it in there I will

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.320 
both so after I put it in there I will
show<00:01:27.260> you<00:01:27.350> what<00:01:27.470> I<00:01:27.500> did<00:01:27.910> but<00:01:28.910> you<00:01:29.000> got<00:01:29.120> to<00:01:29.180> push

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
show you what I did but you got to push

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.430 
show you what I did but you got to push
down<00:01:29.480> pretty<00:01:29.630> hard<00:01:29.780> in<00:01:29.900> this<00:01:29.960> brake<00:01:30.170> pedal<00:01:30.380> to

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
down pretty hard in this brake pedal to

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.580 
down pretty hard in this brake pedal to
get<00:01:30.500> this<00:01:30.650> bolt<00:01:30.920> in<00:01:31.040> I<00:01:31.160> think<00:01:31.400> this<00:01:31.760> is<00:01:31.910> a

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:32.590 
get this bolt in I think this is a

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.220 
get this bolt in I think this is a
bigger<00:01:33.590> bolt<00:01:34.390> instead<00:01:35.390> it's<00:01:35.570> 13<00:01:35.900> millimeter

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:36.230 
bigger bolt instead it's 13 millimeter

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.380 
bigger bolt instead it's 13 millimeter
you<00:01:36.290> could<00:01:36.410> use<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.560> smaller<00:01:36.890> one<00:01:37.100> but<00:01:37.340> let<00:01:38.300> me

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
you could use a smaller one but let me

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.730 
you could use a smaller one but let me
use<00:01:38.540> this<00:01:38.720> one<00:01:38.930> and<00:01:39.200> then<00:01:39.320> I'm<00:01:39.410> going<00:01:39.560> to<00:01:39.590> use

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
use this one and then I'm going to use

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.680 
use this one and then I'm going to use
the<00:01:39.890> lock<00:01:40.070> washer<00:01:40.250> so<00:01:41.210> that<00:01:41.300> doesn't<00:01:41.480> happen

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
the lock washer so that doesn't happen

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.540 
the lock washer so that doesn't happen
again<00:01:41.900> and<00:01:42.320> there<00:01:42.500> you<00:01:42.590> go<00:01:42.740> installed<00:01:43.400> the

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
again and there you go installed the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.330 
again and there you go installed the
bolt<00:01:44.140> into<00:01:45.140> the<00:01:45.290> brake<00:01:45.530> pedal<00:01:46.420> now<00:01:47.420> it<00:01:47.840> is

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
bolt into the brake pedal now it is

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.790 
bolt into the brake pedal now it is
striking<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:52.340> switch<00:01:53.380> showing<00:01:54.380> off<00:01:54.500> lights

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
striking the switch showing off lights

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.850 
striking the switch showing off lights
in<00:01:54.920> the<00:01:55.010> rear<00:01:55.190> so<00:01:59.530> everything<00:02:00.530> is<00:02:00.680> working
