00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:08.389
 c hello the globe today's university is in são luís imagine you up to 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.459
 Federal University of Maranhão 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.829
 I'll show you some of the natural beauty and the wealth 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:18.370
 culture of the state together with students and teachers and tourism the national park 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.170
 of the Maranhenses sheets you will know an initiative to leave the 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:26.269
 town of santo amaro more attractive for tourists and here the center 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:30.070
 you will see how children from the outskirts are 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.870
 learning in a more fun way for this floor with a patrimony of the 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.890
 humanity in the center of biological sciences and health you will know 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.920
 how much bees are needed for the balance of ecosystems and I 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.950
 I'm going to talk to a teacher who studied medicine. 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.950
 for almost 38 years there is much more 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.940
 in são paulo the peace process is a genetic disease of the transmitting parasite 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.940
 schistosomiasis 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.510
 rio de janeiro - geology covered by a tarpaulin will help the Chilean mining company 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.210
 and cereals 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.100
 within the national congress but has no public office 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.100
 find out why it does not seem to me 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.100
 the university stands out 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.590
 Department of Biology of the Federal University of Maranhão 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.650
 their histology laboratory 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.820
 but that honey producers they are almost sowing only that instead of 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.780
 seeds spread the support of some plants and thus collaborate with 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.250
 the reproduction of these species a research coordinated by the teacher 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.710
 I was discovering what kind of bee 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.240
 typical fruit that the exams north and northeast of Brazil I ask so far 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.610
 four species were identified 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.439
 the wineries the car about 40 species of bees single register but yes 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.200
 this study brings a practical application that lied 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.850
 Yes, because the first thing you do and to diagnose what the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.130
 pollinators né 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.850
 you can use this knowledge to increase certain 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.050
 cultures of those above the leg of the region or 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.569
 whether this study can be extended due to its outcome to other 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.090
 other types of flowers then at airports for organizers of the 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.719
 municipality is that they have not been exclusively 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:25.209
 boring they also visit other plants and so they are also 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.879
 responsible for maintaining 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.090
 in particular ecosystems and it is possible to condemn this in a 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.909
 rational way of scientific means you can put my artificial 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:35.020
 certain area 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.679
 is to make it possible to receive waste 

00:02:37.679 --> 00:02:41.189
 next to the early caracu crops that it reaches but is a greater 

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:42.249
 productivity 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:47.309
 and so you can carry this is the second placed on the tide and 

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:51.689
 guaranteeing it is man for our population in the case of the bees in that 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:53.419
 environment and consequently 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:56.859
 the highest number of points because the bees will try a better 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.269
 in that area 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:03.469
 that is to stimulate the production of the novel of the possible with this conserving metals 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:05.030
 cbf is huge 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.119
 with the parallel theme done 

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:09.709
 in all 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:13.839
 We will stop here but if you want other information about what 

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:18.429
 was shown on the program today couples were deserving of university 

00:03:18.429 --> 00:03:21.429
 has the support of pt the fourth fatal victim 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:31.049
 next week the university globe you will meet the hospital 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.939
 university-only animals and also revolutionary projects and 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.299
 environmental engineering 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.779
 the approved area advocates the recycling of debris from works 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.399
 you 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:56.259
