00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
also you got a texture pack that makes

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.360 
also you got a texture pack that makes
it<00:00:12.840> look<00:00:12.900> better<00:00:13.080> you<00:00:13.469> know<00:00:13.590> always<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.219> good

so<00:00:15.059> today<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.330> am<00:00:15.509> going<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.929> show<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.139> how<00:00:16.350> to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
so today I am going to show you how to

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.470 
so today I am going to show you how to
create<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.949> three<00:00:17.250> by<00:00:17.430> two<00:00:17.490> piston<00:00:18.060> door<00:00:18.270> a

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
create a three by two piston door a

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.890 
create a three by two piston door a
little<00:00:19.350> more<00:00:19.500> I<00:00:20.180> say<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.330> is<00:00:21.510> more<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.810> an

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
little more I say this is more of an

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.359 
little more I say this is more of an
intermediate<00:00:22.170> build<00:00:22.650> but<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.039> actually

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
intermediate build but it's actually

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:23.990 
intermediate build but it's actually
pretty<00:00:23.490> simple

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
pretty simple

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.839 
pretty simple
considering<00:00:24.779> I'm<00:00:25.380> using<00:00:25.680> inverters<00:00:26.430> for<00:00:26.670> one

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
considering I'm using inverters for one

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.349 
considering I'm using inverters for one
thing<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.800> create<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.130> quite<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.090> simple

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
thing to create it it's quite a simple

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:36.889 
thing to create it it's quite a simple
build<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:32.570> yeah<00:00:34.730> it's<00:00:35.730> useful<00:00:36.120> if<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.719> want

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.799 
build and yeah it's useful if you want
to<00:00:37.020> really<00:00:37.170> hide<00:00:37.380> your<00:00:37.530> door<00:00:38.149> of<00:00:39.149> course<00:00:39.420> in

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
to really hide your door of course in

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.630 
to really hide your door of course in
the<00:00:40.140> back<00:00:40.320> you're<00:00:40.590> gonna<00:00:40.680> have<00:00:40.980> to<00:00:42.920> make<00:00:43.920> a<00:00:43.950> and

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
the back you're gonna have to make a and

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.729 
the back you're gonna have to make a and
make<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.059> little<00:00:45.329> hallway<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.289> small<00:00:46.559> one

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
make a little hallway it's a small one

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.490 
make a little hallway it's a small one
though<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.430> make<00:00:47.550> sure<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.850> front<00:00:48.120> of<00:00:48.210> is

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
though and make sure the front of is

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.420 
though and make sure the front of is
large<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:49.739> intimidating<00:00:50.430> but<00:00:52.100> all-in-all<00:00:53.100> I

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
large and intimidating but all-in-all I

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.340 
large and intimidating but all-in-all I
think<00:00:53.760> it's<00:00:53.879> actually<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.239> fairly<00:00:54.449> decent<00:00:55.140> size

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
think it's actually a fairly decent size

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.849 
think it's actually a fairly decent size
for<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.280> three<00:00:57.120> by<00:00:57.239> two<00:00:57.270> piston<00:00:57.690> door<00:00:57.809> so<00:00:58.530> how

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
for a three by two piston door so how

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.389 
for a three by two piston door so how
about<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.010> show<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.219> how<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.460> make<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.879> I<00:01:01.399> just

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
about I show you how to make it I just

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.280 
about I show you how to make it I just
make<00:01:02.730> sure<00:01:02.879> you<00:01:02.969> get<00:01:03.090> sticky<00:01:03.420> pistons<00:01:03.840> that's

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
make sure you get sticky pistons that's

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.929 
make sure you get sticky pistons that's
how<00:01:04.409> I<00:01:04.439> start<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.010> can<00:01:05.129> start<00:01:05.400> it<00:01:05.519> however<00:01:05.790> you

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
how I start you can start it however you

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:06.670 
how I start you can start it however you
want

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
want

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.320 
want
go<00:01:07.680> ahead<00:01:07.950> and<00:01:08.310> start<00:01:08.939> with<00:01:09.270> your<00:01:09.900> frame<00:01:11.299> so<00:01:12.299> I

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
go ahead and start with your frame so I

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.880 
go ahead and start with your frame so I
like<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.810> call<00:01:13.020> it

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
like to call it

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.390 
like to call it
go<00:01:14.490> ahead<00:01:15.140> you<00:01:16.140> gotta<00:01:16.320> think<00:01:16.620> this<00:01:16.770> will<00:01:17.160> push

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
go ahead you gotta think this will push

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:18.860 
go ahead you gotta think this will push
that<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.670> which<00:01:18.060> will<00:01:18.180> push<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.480> out<00:01:18.660> so

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
that out which will push this out so

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.380 
that out which will push this out so
this<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.050> where<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:20.130> door<00:01:20.340> will<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.550> so<00:01:21.330> you

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
this is where the door will be so you

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.660 
this is where the door will be so you
gotta<00:01:21.690> get<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.740> really<00:01:22.980> envision<00:01:23.310> that<00:01:23.400> in<00:01:23.460> your

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
gotta get a really envision that in your

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.640 
gotta get a really envision that in your
head<00:01:23.850> otherwise<00:01:24.810> you're<00:01:25.170> going<00:01:25.260> to<00:01:25.350> do<00:01:25.440> what<00:01:25.620> I

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
head otherwise you're going to do what I

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.000 
head otherwise you're going to do what I
do<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.950> couple<00:01:26.340> some<00:01:26.880> times<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:28.010> basically

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
do a couple some times and basically

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.590 
do a couple some times and basically
make<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.430> entire<00:01:29.640> thing<00:01:29.700> backwards<00:01:30.330> I

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
make the entire thing backwards I

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.150 
make the entire thing backwards I
actually<00:01:30.840> had<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.140> redo<00:01:31.410> this<00:01:31.530> video<00:01:31.830> because

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:32.160 
actually had to redo this video because

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.980 
actually had to redo this video because
I<00:01:32.430> made<00:01:32.580> it<00:01:32.700> backwards<00:01:33.060> I<00:01:33.210> was<00:01:33.300> like<00:01:33.420> aw<00:01:33.600> come

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
I made it backwards I was like aw come

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.070 
I made it backwards I was like aw come
on<00:01:34.020> why<00:01:34.410> did<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.650> do<00:01:34.710> that<00:01:35.750> go<00:01:36.750> ahead<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:36.990> fill

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
on why did I do that go ahead and fill

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.830 
on why did I do that go ahead and fill
it<00:01:37.170> with<00:01:37.200> stone<00:01:38.240> so<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.270> will<00:01:39.450> push<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.720> out

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
it with stone so that will push it out

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.420 
it with stone so that will push it out
push<00:01:39.870> it<00:01:40.110> around<00:01:40.320> here<00:01:40.500> and<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:41.100> stone<00:01:41.280> will

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
push it around here and the stone will

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.520 
push it around here and the stone will
be<00:01:41.780> around<00:01:42.780> there<00:01:43.220> all<00:01:44.220> right<00:01:44.370> um<00:01:45.320> how<00:01:46.320> should

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
be around there all right um how should

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.180 
be around there all right um how should
I<00:01:46.650> start<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:48.170> what<00:01:49.170> go<00:01:49.950> behind<00:01:50.250> here<00:01:52.130> go<00:01:53.130> to

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
I start this what go behind here go to

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.070 
I start this what go behind here go to
the<00:01:53.520> first<00:01:53.880> one<00:01:54.030> which<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.240> should<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.869> this

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
the first one which is should be this

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.260 
the first one which is should be this
one<00:01:55.259> it<00:01:55.680> should<00:01:55.830> be<00:01:55.890> facing<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.250> way<00:01:56.430> go

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
one it should be facing that way go

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.900 
one it should be facing that way go
ahead<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.600> dig<00:01:57.720> under<00:01:57.960> it<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.790> place<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
ahead and dig under it and place the

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.210 
ahead and dig under it and place the
repeater<00:02:00.200> facing<00:02:01.200> towards<00:02:01.619> the<00:02:01.710> center<00:02:02.190> of

what<00:02:10.619> am<00:02:10.709> i<00:02:10.800> doing<00:02:11.720> dust<00:02:12.800> make<00:02:13.800> sure<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.070> dig

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
what am i doing dust make sure to dig

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.850 
what am i doing dust make sure to dig
too<00:02:15.239> now<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:18.060> way<00:02:18.209> you<00:02:18.269> can<00:02:18.630> place<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> pathway

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
too now that way you can place a pathway

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.880 
too now that way you can place a pathway
over<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.250> like<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.910> and<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:22.260> won't<00:02:22.470> interrupt

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
over it like so and it won't interrupt

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.559 
over it like so and it won't interrupt
that<00:02:24.140> all<00:02:25.140> right

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
that all right

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.160 
that all right
let's<00:02:27.110> go<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.950> this<00:02:28.719> go<00:02:29.719> ahead<00:02:29.780> and<00:02:29.870> build<00:02:30.049> like

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
let's go to this go ahead and build like

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:33.699 
let's go to this go ahead and build like
that<00:02:30.349> just<00:02:31.219> do<00:02:31.370> that<00:02:31.519> and<00:02:31.790> bring<00:02:32.510> some<00:02:32.959> solid

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
that just do that and bring some solid

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:36.179 
that just do that and bring some solid
block<00:02:33.920> down<00:02:34.219> it<00:02:34.489> doesn't<00:02:34.700> have<00:02:34.849> to<00:02:34.939> be<00:02:35.030> stone

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
block down it doesn't have to be stone

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.039 
block down it doesn't have to be stone
redstone<00:02:37.189> torch<00:02:37.579> torch<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.450> it<00:02:38.780> should<00:02:38.930> do

00:02:39.039 --> 00:02:39.049 
redstone torch torch and it should do

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.020 
redstone torch torch and it should do
that

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
that

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.440 
that
all<00:02:41.030> right<00:02:41.209> let's<00:02:41.450> build<00:02:41.900> a<00:02:41.989> back<00:02:42.170> of<00:02:42.349> it

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
all right let's build a back of it

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.789 
all right let's build a back of it
repeater<00:02:44.450> repeater<00:02:44.810> make<00:02:45.439> sure<00:02:45.590> they're<00:02:45.769> on

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
repeater repeater make sure they're on

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:50.170 
repeater repeater make sure they're on
tick<00:02:46.099> four<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.720> just<00:02:48.879> fill<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:49.970> rest<00:02:50.090> with

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
tick four and just fill the rest with

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.530 
tick four and just fill the rest with
dust<00:02:50.799> then<00:02:51.799> right<00:02:52.040> here<00:02:52.459> go<00:02:52.670> ahead<00:02:52.790> and<00:02:53.269> place

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
dust then right here go ahead and place

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.069 
dust then right here go ahead and place
a<00:02:53.959> torch<00:02:54.409> I'll<00:02:55.280> get<00:02:55.400> back<00:02:55.549> to<00:02:55.579> that<00:02:55.790> in<00:02:55.849> a<00:02:56.000> bit

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:56.079 
a torch I'll get back to that in a bit

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:59.979 
a torch I'll get back to that in a bit
after<00:02:57.079> we<00:02:57.349> finish<00:02:57.650> this<00:02:58.159> side<00:02:58.959> which<00:02:59.959> is

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
after we finish this side which is

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.629 
after we finish this side which is
basically<00:03:00.409> the<00:03:00.560> same<00:03:00.680> as<00:03:00.859> the<00:03:00.950> other<00:03:01.069> you<00:03:01.519> know

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:01.639 
basically the same as the other you know

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.619 
basically the same as the other you know
symmetry<00:03:02.269> is<00:03:02.389> quite<00:03:02.870> important<00:03:03.939> well<00:03:04.939> it's

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:05.629 
symmetry is quite important well it's

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:07.330 
symmetry is quite important well it's
actually<00:03:05.780> now<00:03:06.439> that<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.620> put<00:03:06.799> that<00:03:06.859> torch<00:03:07.129> there

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.340 
actually now that I put that torch there

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.199 
actually now that I put that torch there
it's<00:03:07.489> not<00:03:07.579> too<00:03:07.760> symmetrical<00:03:08.030> but<00:03:08.530> either<00:03:09.530> way

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
it's not too symmetrical but either way

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.830 
it's not too symmetrical but either way
alright<00:03:11.209> now<00:03:11.329> that<00:03:11.389> that's<00:03:11.629> set<00:03:12.019> up<00:03:12.909> let's<00:03:13.909> go

it out a couple bits to kind of give you
a<00:03:44.299> better<00:03:44.870> general<00:03:45.199> idea<00:03:45.549> because<00:03:46.549> we're

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:46.639 
a better general idea because we're

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.129 
a better general idea because we're
going<00:03:46.760> to<00:03:46.819> be<00:03:46.879> travelling<00:03:47.269> dust<00:03:47.540> up<00:03:47.720> there<00:03:47.900> and

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
going to be travelling dust up there and

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:50.649 
going to be travelling dust up there and
if<00:03:48.799> it<00:03:49.010> goes<00:03:49.250> anywhere<00:03:49.519> near<00:03:49.639> these<00:03:50.030> ones<00:03:50.269> it

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
if it goes anywhere near these ones it

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:53.319 
if it goes anywhere near these ones it
will<00:03:50.900> screw<00:03:51.229> the<00:03:51.319> entire<00:03:51.560> thing<00:03:51.739> up<00:03:51.859> and<00:03:52.329> I'll

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:53.329 
will screw the entire thing up and I'll

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.550 
will screw the entire thing up and I'll
actually<00:03:53.510> do<00:03:54.109> more<00:03:54.349> on<00:03:54.500> that<00:03:54.530> in<00:03:54.680> a<00:03:54.889> bit

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
actually do more on that in a bit

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.770 
actually do more on that in a bit
basically<00:03:57.560> the<00:03:57.859> general<00:03:58.760> problems<00:03:59.389> you<00:03:59.659> will

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
basically the general problems you will

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.000 
basically the general problems you will
see<00:03:59.989> if<00:04:00.169> something<00:04:01.040> wrong<00:04:01.340> happens<00:04:02.560> so<00:04:03.560> just

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
see if something wrong happens so just

see if something wrong happens so just
go<00:04:04.099> ahead<00:04:04.159> and<00:04:04.340> do<00:04:04.400> this<00:04:04.840> alright<00:04:05.840> just<00:04:06.769> kind

00:04:07.089 --> 00:04:07.099 
go ahead and do this alright just kind

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:09.650 
go ahead and do this alright just kind
of<00:04:07.129> pinpoint<00:04:07.549> where<00:04:07.699> they<00:04:07.790> are

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
of pinpoint where they are

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.270 
of pinpoint where they are
that<00:04:10.660> should<00:04:10.810> work<00:04:10.840> now<00:04:11.650> for<00:04:11.680> those<00:04:12.070> of<00:04:12.190> you

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:12.280 
that should work now for those of you

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.830 
that should work now for those of you
wondering<00:04:12.430> why<00:04:12.850> isn't<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.390> middle<00:04:13.660> one

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
wondering why isn't the middle one

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.310 
wondering why isn't the middle one
pushing<00:04:14.650> out<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:16.540> just<00:04:16.720> have<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.900> do<00:04:16.989> that<00:04:17.140> and

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:17.320 
pushing out you just have to do that and

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.990 
pushing out you just have to do that and
it<00:04:17.470> should<00:04:17.650> never<00:04:17.830> do<00:04:18.070> that<00:04:18.190> again<00:04:18.310> you<00:04:18.820> should

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
it should never do that again you should

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.720 
it should never do that again you should
be<00:04:19.090> fine<00:04:19.270> from<00:04:19.450> now<00:04:19.660> I<00:04:20.310> actually<00:04:21.310> think<00:04:21.489> that's

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
be fine from now I actually think that's

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.750 
be fine from now I actually think that's
it<00:04:21.940> oh<00:04:23.340> that<00:04:24.340> looks<00:04:24.520> oh<00:04:24.790> wait<00:04:25.390> yeah<00:04:26.610> I'm<00:04:27.610> just

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
it oh that looks oh wait yeah I'm just

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:29.900 
it oh that looks oh wait yeah I'm just
going<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:27.970> attach<00:04:28.210> to<00:04:28.420> a<00:04:28.450> button<00:04:28.660> for<00:04:28.840> now<00:04:28.960> I

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
going to attach to a button for now I

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:33.600 
going to attach to a button for now I
will<00:04:31.170> I'll<00:04:32.170> probably<00:04:32.440> make<00:04:32.650> a<00:04:32.710> tutorial<00:04:33.100> on<00:04:33.370> T

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
will I'll probably make a tutorial on T

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.420 
will I'll probably make a tutorial on T
flip-flops<00:04:34.120> here<00:04:34.390> in<00:04:34.480> a<00:04:34.540> bit<00:04:34.890> and<00:04:35.890> for<00:04:36.370> those

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
flip-flops here in a bit and for those

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.620 
flip-flops here in a bit and for those
of<00:04:36.490> you<00:04:36.640> that<00:04:36.760> don't<00:04:36.880> know<00:04:36.970> what<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.180> means<00:04:37.210> or

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
of you that don't know what it means or

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.160 
of you that don't know what it means or
what<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.350> means<00:04:38.590> it<00:04:39.040> is<00:04:39.520> it<00:04:40.390> basically<00:04:40.540> make

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:41.170 
what that means it is it basically make

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:44.280 
what that means it is it basically make
turns<00:04:41.440> a<00:04:41.680> button<00:04:41.950> into<00:04:42.400> a<00:04:43.020> universal<00:04:44.020> switch

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
turns a button into a universal switch

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.550 
turns a button into a universal switch
and<00:04:44.470> what<00:04:44.560> I<00:04:44.590> mean<00:04:44.740> by<00:04:44.800> universal<00:04:46.560> switches

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
and what I mean by universal switches

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.950 
and what I mean by universal switches
you<00:04:47.680> can<00:04:47.800> only<00:04:47.950> do<00:04:48.100> it<00:04:48.220> from<00:04:48.370> one<00:04:48.550> location<00:04:49.480> a

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
you can only do it from one location a

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.010 
you can only do it from one location a
button<00:04:50.590> you<00:04:50.770> can<00:04:50.950> hook<00:04:51.220> it<00:04:51.340> up<00:04:51.430> in<00:04:51.610> any<00:04:52.020> area

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
button you can hook it up in any area

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.690 
button you can hook it up in any area
and<00:04:53.590> it<00:04:54.220> yeah<00:04:54.700> that's<00:04:55.150> really<00:04:55.570> convenient<00:04:56.700> put

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:57.700 
and it yeah that's really convenient put

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:58.770 
and it yeah that's really convenient put
them<00:04:57.820> in<00:04:57.880> any<00:04:58.000> room<00:04:58.210> of<00:04:58.330> your<00:04:58.390> house<00:04:58.600> and

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
them in any room of your house and

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:06.240 
them in any room of your house and
control<00:04:59.050> it<00:04:59.140> so<00:04:59.680> oh<00:05:03.600> oh<00:05:04.600> all<00:05:05.230> right<00:05:05.380> you<00:05:06.130> know

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:06.250 
control it so oh oh all right you know

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.240 
control it so oh oh all right you know
that's<00:05:06.430> actually<00:05:06.610> perfect<00:05:07.320> perfect<00:05:08.320> I<00:05:08.590> was

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
that's actually perfect perfect I was

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.040 
that's actually perfect perfect I was
going<00:05:09.400> to<00:05:09.460> show<00:05:09.580> you<00:05:09.640> guys<00:05:09.850> this<00:05:10.120> that's<00:05:10.870> what

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:11.050 
going to show you guys this that's what

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:14.070 
going to show you guys this that's what
happens<00:05:11.440> when<00:05:11.890> you<00:05:12.040> do<00:05:12.400> not<00:05:12.790> put<00:05:13.720> it<00:05:13.810> to<00:05:13.900> tick

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
happens when you do not put it to tick

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.990 
happens when you do not put it to tick
for<00:05:14.290> as<00:05:15.540> precisely<00:05:16.540> what<00:05:16.900> happens<00:05:17.640> so<00:05:18.640> if

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
for as precisely what happens so if

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.180 
for as precisely what happens so if
that's<00:05:19.300> what's<00:05:19.570> happening<00:05:19.930> to<00:05:20.110> you

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
that's what's happening to you

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.740 
that's what's happening to you
make<00:05:21.490> sure<00:05:21.610> to<00:05:21.640> check<00:05:21.910> the<00:05:22.030> repeaters<00:05:22.450> to<00:05:22.480> see

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:22.750 
make sure to check the repeaters to see

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.440 
make sure to check the repeaters to see
if<00:05:22.840> the<00:05:22.960> tick<00:05:23.140> is<00:05:23.290> set<00:05:23.710> to<00:05:23.950> four<00:05:24.370> so<00:05:25.120> that<00:05:25.300> does

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
if the tick is set to four so that does

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.650 
if the tick is set to four so that does
that<00:05:25.630> nice<00:05:26.080> and<00:05:26.350> clean<00:05:27.240> all<00:05:28.240> right<00:05:28.300> now<00:05:28.570> I'm

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:28.660 
that nice and clean all right now I'm

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:30.900 
that nice and clean all right now I'm
going<00:05:28.780> to<00:05:28.840> show<00:05:28.960> you<00:05:29.020> what<00:05:29.170> happens<00:05:29.700> just<00:05:30.700> to

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
going to show you what happens just to

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.310 
going to show you what happens just to
kind<00:05:31.360> of<00:05:31.390> give<00:05:31.540> you<00:05:31.600> guys<00:05:31.750> an<00:05:31.960> idea<00:05:32.020> if

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
kind of give you guys an idea if

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.470 
kind of give you guys an idea if
something<00:05:33.070> wrong<00:05:33.310> is<00:05:33.490> happening<00:05:33.520> what

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:34.480 
something wrong is happening what

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.129 
something wrong is happening what
happens<00:05:34.780> if<00:05:35.050> you<00:05:35.230> do<00:05:35.440> it<00:05:35.560> like<00:05:35.710> this

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:45.299 

-<00:05:39.139> to<00:05:39.529> get<00:05:39.680> there<00:05:39.889> oh<00:05:43.659> yeah<00:05:44.659> there<00:05:44.900> we<00:05:44.930> go

00:05:45.299 --> 00:05:45.309 
- to get there oh yeah there we go

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:50.320 
- to get there oh yeah there we go
it<00:05:46.309> yeah<00:05:47.300> basically<00:05:48.490> it<00:05:49.490> causes<00:05:49.879> this<00:05:50.029> one<00:05:50.240> to

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
it yeah basically it causes this one to

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:54.339 
it yeah basically it causes this one to
push<00:05:50.479> out<00:05:50.659> way<00:05:50.839> too<00:05:50.900> soon<00:05:51.610> so<00:05:52.610> and<00:05:53.059> since<00:05:53.360> well

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:54.349 
push out way too soon so and since well

00:05:54.349 --> 00:05:55.989 
push out way too soon so and since well
this<00:05:54.620> would<00:05:54.800> be<00:05:54.830> extended<00:05:55.490> because<00:05:55.729> of<00:05:55.879> this

00:05:55.989 --> 00:05:55.999 
this would be extended because of this

00:05:55.999 --> 00:06:00.159 
this would be extended because of this
can't<00:05:56.960> push<00:05:57.080> that<00:05:57.199> out<00:05:58.120> since<00:05:59.120> Pistons<00:05:59.900> can't

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:00.169 
can't push that out since Pistons can't

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.989 
can't push that out since Pistons can't
push<00:06:00.430> extended<00:06:01.430> pistons

00:06:01.989 --> 00:06:01.999 
push extended pistons

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:04.089 
push extended pistons
alright<00:06:02.539> you<00:06:02.629> know<00:06:02.719> what<00:06:02.749> keep<00:06:02.960> that<00:06:03.110> so<00:06:03.919> just

00:06:04.089 --> 00:06:04.099 
alright you know what keep that so just

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:05.829 
alright you know what keep that so just
make<00:06:04.249> sure<00:06:04.279> it's<00:06:04.789> something<00:06:05.479> like<00:06:05.569> this<00:06:05.689> it

00:06:05.829 --> 00:06:05.839 
make sure it's something like this it

00:06:05.839 --> 00:06:07.299 
make sure it's something like this it
doesn't<00:06:06.020> have<00:06:06.110> to<00:06:06.199> be<00:06:06.289> exactly<00:06:06.680> like<00:06:06.919> that

00:06:07.299 --> 00:06:07.309 
doesn't have to be exactly like that

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:16.810 
doesn't have to be exactly like that
and<00:06:07.669> then<00:06:08.629> go<00:06:09.589> ahead<00:06:09.710> and<00:06:09.919> fix<00:06:10.430> that

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:16.820 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:21.220 

my<00:06:17.360> cool<00:06:17.570> piston<00:06:17.900> anyways<00:06:18.770> so<00:06:19.340> um<00:06:20.080> that's<00:06:21.080> all

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:21.230 
my cool piston anyways so um that's all

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.400 
my cool piston anyways so um that's all
it's<00:06:21.800> actually<00:06:22.130> a<00:06:22.160> pretty<00:06:22.340> simple<00:06:22.940> build<00:06:23.410> so
