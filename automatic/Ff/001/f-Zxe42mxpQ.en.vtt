hello<00:00:00.299> guys<00:00:00.570> and<00:00:00.599> girls<00:00:01.050> it's<00:00:01.560> license<00:00:02.250> here

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:02.870 
hello guys and girls it's license here

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:07.000 
hello guys and girls it's license here
today<00:00:03.870> I'm<00:00:04.049> doing<00:00:04.259> a<00:00:04.589> redstone<00:00:05.569> tutorial

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.010 
today I'm doing a redstone tutorial

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:12.620 
today I'm doing a redstone tutorial
basically<00:00:08.010> I'm<00:00:08.340> creating<00:00:09.620> a<00:00:11.389> button<00:00:12.389> on/off

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
basically I'm creating a button on/off

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.150 
basically I'm creating a button on/off
system<00:00:13.380> what<00:00:14.160> it<00:00:14.280> does<00:00:14.519> basically<00:00:15.890> turns<00:00:16.890> on

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
system what it does basically turns on

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.830 
system what it does basically turns on
the<00:00:17.670> lights<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.240> turns<00:00:19.109> off<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.830> light<00:00:20.840> at

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
the lights and turns off the light at

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.580 
the lights and turns off the light at
each<00:00:22.740> click<00:00:23.189> so<00:00:23.699> it<00:00:23.850> doesn't<00:00:24.269> turn<00:00:25.230> it<00:00:25.410> on

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
each click so it doesn't turn it on

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.849 
each click so it doesn't turn it on
while<00:00:26.189> clicking<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.990> it<00:00:27.990> goes<00:00:28.230> off<00:00:28.470> after<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
while clicking and it goes off after a

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:36.310 
while clicking and it goes off after a
few<00:00:29.070> seconds<00:00:29.660> it's<00:00:30.660> just<00:00:31.019> click<00:00:31.320> off<00:00:33.079> click<00:00:34.079> on

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
few seconds it's just click off click on

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.440 
few seconds it's just click off click on
it's<00:00:37.320> very<00:00:37.680> simple<00:00:38.040> actually<00:00:38.370> you<00:00:39.030> only<00:00:39.180> need

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
it's very simple actually you only need

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.459 
it's very simple actually you only need
one<00:00:39.719> memory<00:00:40.649> cell<00:00:41.360> two<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.600> gates<00:00:43.020> in<00:00:43.350> the

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
one memory cell two and gates in the

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.040 
one memory cell two and gates in the
future<00:00:44.539> well<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.870> lot<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.440> redstone<00:00:46.860> actually

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
future well a lot of redstone actually

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.160 
future well a lot of redstone actually
some<00:00:49.050> repeaters<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.890> yeah<00:00:50.399> torches<00:00:52.730> so<00:00:53.730> let's

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
some repeaters and yeah torches so let's

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:02.990 
some repeaters and yeah torches so let's
see<00:00:55.170> how<00:00:55.199> we<00:00:55.440> make<00:00:55.800> this<00:00:57.469> we<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:59.870> one<00:01:02.000> memory

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
see how we make this we have one memory

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.219 
see how we make this we have one memory
cell<00:01:03.510> here<00:01:04.549> I'm<00:01:05.549> not<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.270> into<00:01:06.630> much<00:01:06.869> detail

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
cell here I'm not going into much detail

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.730 
cell here I'm not going into much detail
on<00:01:07.530> how<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:07.740> create<00:01:08.460> this<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.659> find<00:01:09.960> tons

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
on how to create this you can find tons

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.609 
on how to create this you can find tons
of<00:01:11.070> tutorials<00:01:11.250> on<00:01:11.820> how<00:01:11.909> to<00:01:11.939> creating<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.900> memory

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
of tutorials on how to creating a memory

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.730 
of tutorials on how to creating a memory
so<00:01:13.979> it's<00:01:14.220> basically<00:01:15.049> three<00:01:16.049> by<00:01:16.170> three<00:01:16.409> block

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
so it's basically three by three block

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.890 
so it's basically three by three block
and<00:01:17.189> well<00:01:18.060> set<00:01:18.360> up<00:01:18.479> like<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:20.630> after<00:01:21.630> that

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
and well set up like this after that

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.020 
and well set up like this after that
we're<00:01:22.350> going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.950> make<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.759> end<00:01:23.970> gates<00:01:26.030> that's

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
we're going to make the end gates that's

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.770 
we're going to make the end gates that's
it's<00:01:27.390> very<00:01:27.659> simple<00:01:28.080> you<00:01:28.320> just<00:01:28.729> put<00:01:29.780> three

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
it's very simple you just put three

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.499 
it's very simple you just put three
blocks<00:01:31.079> in<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.380> row<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:32.159> we<00:01:33.030> want<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.329> leave

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
blocks in a row and we want to leave

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.359 
blocks in a row and we want to leave
three<00:01:33.840> spaces<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.470> between<00:01:34.500> the<00:01:34.950> two<00:01:35.100> gates

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
three spaces in between the two gates

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.370 
three spaces in between the two gates
because<00:01:36.920> else<00:01:37.920> we<00:01:38.310> would<00:01:38.869> mess<00:01:39.869> up<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.290> whole

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
because else we would mess up the whole

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.370 
because else we would mess up the whole
system<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.430> we<00:01:41.579> don't<00:01:41.729> want<00:01:41.850> that<00:01:42.060> so<00:01:42.570> three

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
system and we don't want that so three

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.810 
system and we don't want that so three
blocks<00:01:44.960> two<00:01:45.960> torches<00:01:46.470> here<00:01:47.540> one<00:01:48.540> torch<00:01:48.840> here

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
blocks two torches here one torch here

00:01:49.820 --> 00:02:02.550 
blocks two torches here one torch here
redstone<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.030> top<00:01:51.479> up<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:54.530> writes<00:01:55.530> on<00:01:55.710> here

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.149 

okay<00:02:03.560> now<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.159> we<00:02:04.490> have<00:02:04.520> that<00:02:04.640> we<00:02:06.159> should

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
okay now that we have that we should

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:11.920 
okay now that we have that we should
connect<00:02:07.640> everything<00:02:08.090> together<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:10.510> course<00:02:11.510> we

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
connect everything together of course we

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.979 
connect everything together of course we
will<00:02:12.430> need<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.610> follow<00:02:13.879> wait<00:02:14.209> alphabet

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
will need to follow wait alphabet

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:28.330 
will need to follow wait alphabet
resonator<00:02:15.470> sorry<00:02:15.920> guys<00:02:19.360> yeah<00:02:26.709> like<00:02:27.709> this<00:02:27.950> put

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
resonator sorry guys yeah like this put

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.819 
resonator sorry guys yeah like this put
this<00:02:28.819> repeater<00:02:29.360> on<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.840> fort<00:02:30.349> notch<00:02:30.620> and<00:02:32.829> you

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:33.829 
this repeater on the fort notch and you

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:39.539 
this repeater on the fort notch and you
want<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.730> make<00:02:34.879> sure<00:02:34.940> this<00:02:37.420> this<00:02:38.420> repeater

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:39.549 
want to make sure this this repeater

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.900 
want to make sure this this repeater
slows<00:02:40.549> down<00:02:42.040> slows<00:02:43.040> down<00:02:43.280> the<00:02:43.459> redstone

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
slows down slows down the redstone

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.400 
slows down slows down the redstone
circuit<00:02:44.239> and<00:02:45.730> make<00:02:46.730> sure<00:02:46.760> it<00:02:47.269> goes<00:02:48.019> slower

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
circuit and make sure it goes slower

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.400 
circuit and make sure it goes slower
than<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:49.190> ones<00:02:49.609> you<00:02:49.760> will<00:02:50.120> be<00:02:50.720> putting<00:02:51.049> here

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
than the ones you will be putting here

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:08.110 
than the ones you will be putting here
after<00:02:54.410> you<00:02:54.560> press<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.069> button<00:02:59.140> so<00:03:00.140> wait<00:03:07.120> so

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
after you press the button so wait so

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.589 
after you press the button so wait so
you<00:03:08.180> really<00:03:08.720> want<00:03:08.959> the<00:03:09.260> button<00:03:10.190> to<00:03:10.940> be<00:03:11.060> faster

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:11.599 
you really want the button to be faster

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:15.520 
you really want the button to be faster
than<00:03:11.859> the<00:03:12.859> memory<00:03:13.250> cell<00:03:13.549> output<00:03:14.139> that<00:03:15.139> adds

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
than the memory cell output that adds

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.000 
than the memory cell output that adds
back<00:03:15.919> to<00:03:16.099> the<00:03:16.220> gates<00:03:16.959> then<00:03:17.959> you<00:03:18.169> have<00:03:18.319> one

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.010 
back to the gates then you have one

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.909 
back to the gates then you have one
redstone<00:03:19.790> line<00:03:20.359> that<00:03:20.900> goes<00:03:20.930> directly<00:03:21.319> into

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
redstone line that goes directly into

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:27.000 
redstone line that goes directly into
the<00:03:22.790> end<00:03:22.880> gate<00:03:23.150> and<00:03:23.389> on<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.810> other<00:03:23.930> side<00:03:25.510> you

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
the end gate and on the other side you

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.379 
the end gate and on the other side you
want<00:03:28.010> to<00:03:28.190> make<00:03:28.430> a<00:03:28.730> in<00:03:29.599> further<00:03:31.030> put<00:03:32.030> on<00:03:32.209> top

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:32.389 
want to make a in further put on top

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:35.680 
want to make a in further put on top
else<00:03:33.049> it<00:03:33.200> won't<00:03:33.380> work<00:03:34.120> yeah<00:03:35.120> that's<00:03:35.450> basically

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:35.690 
else it won't work yeah that's basically

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.890 
else it won't work yeah that's basically
it

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.280 

I'm<00:03:39.680> not<00:03:39.950> going<00:03:40.189> to<00:03:40.400> connect<00:03:40.879> it<00:03:41.230> to<00:03:43.060> this

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 
I'm not going to connect it to this
