00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
alright so for this tutorial what I'm

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:03.560 
alright so for this tutorial what I'm
going<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.580> do<00:00:02.669> is<00:00:02.850> show<00:00:03.060> you<00:00:03.090> how<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.360> make<00:00:03.419> a

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:03.570 
going to do is show you how to make a

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.619 
going to do is show you how to make a
piece<00:00:03.929> of<00:00:03.959> rope<00:00:04.319> in<00:00:04.589> c4d<00:00:05.549> we're<00:00:06.450> going<00:00:06.569> to

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
piece of rope in c4d we're going to

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.580 
piece of rope in c4d we're going to
start<00:00:06.930> out<00:00:07.200> with<00:00:07.230> a<00:00:07.820> cylinder<00:00:08.820> primitive<00:00:09.330> and

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
start out with a cylinder primitive and

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.660 
start out with a cylinder primitive and
then<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.710> attributes<00:00:11.250> I'm<00:00:11.370> going<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.550> take

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
then the attributes I'm going to take

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.690 
then the attributes I'm going to take
the<00:00:11.849> radius<00:00:12.240> down<00:00:12.900> to<00:00:13.170> about<00:00:13.349> five<00:00:13.799> height

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
the radius down to about five height

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.510 
the radius down to about five height
leave<00:00:15.360> out<00:00:15.540> at<00:00:15.660> two<00:00:15.900> hundred<00:00:16.109> height<00:00:16.890> segments

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
leave out at two hundred height segments

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.080 
leave out at two hundred height segments
take<00:00:18.330> that<00:00:18.510> up<00:00:18.630> to<00:00:18.779> about<00:00:18.900> 80<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.820> I'll<00:00:20.820> take

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
take that up to about 80 and I'll take

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.410 
take that up to about 80 and I'll take
caps<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:22.100> disable<00:00:23.100> that<00:00:23.279> hit<00:00:23.789> see<00:00:24.150> on<00:00:24.300> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
caps and disable that hit see on the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.679 
caps and disable that hit see on the
keyboard<00:00:26.480> now<00:00:27.480> you<00:00:27.539> can<00:00:27.720> see<00:00:27.960> how<00:00:28.230> many

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
keyboard now you can see how many

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.310 
keyboard now you can see how many
segments<00:00:30.689> we<00:00:30.840> have<00:00:31.050> in<00:00:31.260> our<00:00:32.750> piece<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.930> strand

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
segments we have in our piece of strand

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.869 
segments we have in our piece of strand
of<00:00:34.590> our<00:00:34.710> rope<00:00:35.329> and<00:00:37.219> we're<00:00:38.219> going<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.430> do<00:00:38.610> next

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
of our rope and we're going to do next

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.260 
of our rope and we're going to do next
let's<00:00:39.510> go<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.719> top<00:00:40.050> view<00:00:40.520> bit<00:00:41.520> neff<00:00:41.730> to<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:42.210> the

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
let's go to top view bit neff to and the

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.090 
let's go to top view bit neff to and the
keyboard<00:00:42.450> by<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> way<00:00:43.110> to<00:00:43.530> get<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:43.860> top

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
keyboard by the way to get to the top

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.979 
keyboard by the way to get to the top
view<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.750> I'm<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:45.899> take<00:00:46.079> this<00:00:46.320> cylinder

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
view and I'm going to take this cylinder

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.049 
view and I'm going to take this cylinder
and<00:00:48.989> I'm<00:00:49.140> hold<00:00:49.410> down<00:00:49.800> alt<00:00:50.039> option<00:00:50.370> key<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
and I'm hold down alt option key and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.979 
and I'm hold down alt option key and
will<00:00:51.539> choose<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.050> array<00:00:52.350> object<00:00:53.690> now<00:00:54.690> if<00:00:54.870> I

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
will choose the array object now if I

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.510 
will choose the array object now if I
just<00:00:55.199> pull<00:00:55.469> in<00:00:55.680> my<00:00:56.640> radius<00:00:58.250> should<00:00:59.250> see<00:00:59.489> our

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
just pull in my radius should see our

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.510 
just pull in my radius should see our
cylinders<00:01:00.390> come<00:01:00.629> in<00:01:00.809> there<00:01:01.170> they<00:01:01.379> are<00:01:01.460> so<00:01:02.460> I'm

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
cylinders come in there they are so I'm

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.600 
cylinders come in there they are so I'm
about<00:01:03.140> 11<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.290> radius<00:01:04.650> I'm<00:01:05.250> going<00:01:05.400> to<00:01:05.489> take

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
about 11 on the radius I'm going to take

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.590 
about 11 on the radius I'm going to take
the<00:01:05.820> copies<00:01:06.420> take<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.380> down<00:01:07.619> to<00:01:07.799> about<00:01:07.830> four

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
the copies take that down to about four

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.820 
the copies take that down to about four
actually<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:09.720> need<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.930> pull<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.260> radius<00:01:10.590> in

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
actually we need to pull the radius in

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.800 
actually we need to pull the radius in
so<00:01:11.189> let's<00:01:11.400> go<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:12.420> about<00:01:12.659> eight<00:01:13.520> so<00:01:14.520> they<00:01:14.760> just

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
so let's go to about eight so they just

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:22.340 
so let's go to about eight so they just
overlap<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:17.990> of<00:01:18.990> next<00:01:20.210> available<00:01:21.350> cylinder

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
overlap the of next available cylinder

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.050 
overlap the of next available cylinder
and<00:01:22.500> this<00:01:23.130> array<00:01:24.619> there<00:01:25.619> we<00:01:25.710> go<00:01:25.909> now<00:01:26.909> you'll

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
and this array there we go now you'll

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.850 
and this array there we go now you'll
notice<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> object<00:01:27.960> manager<00:01:28.350> if<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.650> hit

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
notice in the object manager if I hit

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.830 
notice in the object manager if I hit
see<00:01:29.250> on<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.700> keyboard<00:01:30.119> just<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.479> make<00:01:30.630> that

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
see on the keyboard just to make that

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.319 
see on the keyboard just to make that
object<00:01:31.320> editable<00:01:31.829> that<00:01:32.610> makes<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:32.970> array<00:01:33.299> a

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
object editable that makes that array a

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.179 
object editable that makes that array a
null<00:01:33.720> object<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.380> now<00:01:34.500> I<00:01:34.530> have<00:01:34.770> five

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
null object and now I have five

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.359 
null object and now I have five
different<00:01:35.729> cylinders<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.990> there<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:38.189> what<00:01:38.340> I

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
different cylinders in there so what I

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.719 
different cylinders in there so what I
need<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.610> do<00:01:38.820> next<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.750> lasso<00:01:40.380> select<00:01:40.860> those

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
need to do next so lasso select those

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.569 
need to do next so lasso select those
five<00:01:42.090> cylinders<00:01:42.720> and<00:01:43.189> connect<00:01:44.189> them<00:01:44.340> I'm

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
five cylinders and connect them I'm

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.149 
five cylinders and connect them I'm
right-clicking<00:01:45.270> and<00:01:45.570> I'm<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.170> connect

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:51.289 

once<00:01:50.159> I<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.460> you'll<00:01:50.820> see<00:01:51.030> that<00:01:51.180> i<00:01:51.240> have

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
once I do that you'll see that i have

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.770 
once I do that you'll see that i have
another<00:01:52.970> polygon<00:01:53.970> object<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> object

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
another polygon object in the object

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.289 
another polygon object in the object
manager<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.500> actually<00:01:55.890> i<00:01:56.070> can<00:01:56.520> take<00:01:56.729> this

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
manager and actually i can take this

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.109 
manager and actually i can take this
array<00:01:57.930> just<00:01:58.650> delete<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.040> you'll<00:01:59.729> need<00:01:59.940> that

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
array just delete it you'll need that

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.249 
array just delete it you'll need that
anymore<00:02:00.530> and<00:02:01.530> if<00:02:01.830> i<00:02:01.950> go<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.100> f1<00:02:02.820> my<00:02:03.600> perspective

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
anymore and if i go to f1 my perspective

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.130 
anymore and if i go to f1 my perspective
now<00:02:04.710> we<00:02:04.770> only<00:02:05.040> have<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.600> polygon<00:02:06.600> object<00:02:06.659> in

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
now we only have one polygon object in

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.420 
now we only have one polygon object in
the<00:02:07.259> object<00:02:07.380> manager<00:02:09.950> now<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.009> only<00:02:11.310> thing

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
the object manager now the only thing

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.729 
the object manager now the only thing
left<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.090> do<00:02:12.300> for<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.870> piece<00:02:13.140> of<00:02:13.319> rope<00:02:13.530> is

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
left to do for this piece of rope is

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:16.760 
left to do for this piece of rope is
that<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.970> need<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.330> deform<00:02:15.840> it<00:02:15.959> and<00:02:16.140> what<00:02:16.709> I'm

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
that I need to deform it and what I'm

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.240 
that I need to deform it and what I'm
going<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:16.920> do<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.280> choose<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.819> twist<00:02:18.450> of<00:02:18.630> former

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
going to do is choose a twist of former

object now it makes it out of the
polygon<00:02:57.540> object<00:02:57.769> so<00:02:58.769> let's<00:02:58.920> go<00:02:59.160> into<00:02:59.670> the

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
polygon object so let's go into the

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.370 
polygon object so let's go into the
attributes<00:03:00.209> of<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.510> twist<00:03:01.140> object<00:03:02.180> and<00:03:03.380> we

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
attributes of the twist object and we

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.150 
attributes of the twist object and we
can<00:03:04.590> scale<00:03:04.980> down<00:03:05.040> the<00:03:05.780> size<00:03:06.780> right<00:03:07.470> here<00:03:07.530> so

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
can scale down the size right here so

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.180 
can scale down the size right here so
about<00:03:08.720> let's<00:03:09.720> go<00:03:09.959> with<00:03:10.579> 25<00:03:11.579> and<00:03:11.609> the<00:03:12.560> x.25<00:03:13.560> and

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
about let's go with 25 and the x.25 and

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.479 
about let's go with 25 and the x.25 and
the<00:03:14.760> Z<00:03:15.060> we<00:03:15.420> leave<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:16.190> y-coordinates<00:03:17.190> alone

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
the Z we leave the y-coordinates alone

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.630 
the Z we leave the y-coordinates alone
and<00:03:18.260> the<00:03:19.260> only<00:03:19.410> thing<00:03:19.500> left<00:03:19.859> to<00:03:20.040> do<00:03:20.190> is<00:03:20.220> take

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
and the only thing left to do is take

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.930 
and the only thing left to do is take
the<00:03:20.820> angle<00:03:21.000> and<00:03:21.290> just<00:03:22.290> twist<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:22.829> right<00:03:23.250> up

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940
