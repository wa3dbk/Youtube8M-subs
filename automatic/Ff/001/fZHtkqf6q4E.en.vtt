one of my favorites get away and look

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.340 
one of my favorites get away and look
out<00:00:36.530> are<00:00:36.739> pretty<00:00:37.070> good<00:00:37.280> i<00:00:37.340> like<00:00:37.610> them<00:00:37.880> but

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.350 
out are pretty good i like them but

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.570 
out are pretty good i like them but
erosion<00:00:39.350> is<00:00:39.440> definitely<00:00:39.830> the<00:00:39.920> best<00:00:40.129> and<00:00:40.460> the

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:40.580 
erosion is definitely the best and the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.390 
erosion is definitely the best and the
ground<00:00:40.850> could<00:00:41.420> just<00:00:41.660> go<00:00:42.050> suck<00:00:42.379> it<00:00:42.559> I<00:00:42.710> really

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
ground could just go suck it I really

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.250 
ground could just go suck it I really

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
that I like how they did this tunnel

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.160 
that I like how they did this tunnel
system<00:00:55.850> below<00:00:56.120> and<00:00:56.390> how<00:00:56.510> like<00:00:56.690> the<00:00:56.809> map<00:00:57.019> is

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
system below and how like the map is

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.700 
system below and how like the map is
just<00:00:57.320> construction<00:00:57.920> constructed<00:00:59.409> they<00:01:00.409> did

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
just construction constructed they did

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.619 
just construction constructed they did
it<00:01:00.800> kind<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:00.949> like<00:01:01.070> a<00:01:01.129> box<00:01:01.400> area<00:01:02.030> then<00:01:02.420> you<00:01:02.510> got

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629
