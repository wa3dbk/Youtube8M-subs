00:00:01.669 --> 00:00:07.920
 the toyota prius and the opel ampera are 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.540
 popular company cars 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.700
 normally a portion of 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.340
 the catalog value of his car 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.680
 no your salary added up and you have to go over it 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.320
 you pay tax but not in 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.949
 the case of the prius and the ampera 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.170
 at least until January 1, 2014 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.560
 after that applies to both cars and 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.199
 addition rate of 7% 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:37.559
 haste is therefore required, but which of the 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:40.079
 two you should now have cars like the 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.000
 opel ampera and the plugin variant of 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.340
 this toyota prius ride on 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.089
 electricity but switch to one 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.760
 gasoline engine 

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.769
 when the power is on that returned 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.519
 the past a lot of tax breaks 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:55.680
 on 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:57.449
 whether you charge or not you can with 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.050
 this kind of cars, however, a lot of money 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.909
 save 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.030
 and that is not only related to it 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:05.159
 moment when you buy one 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.640
 The Opel Ampera is less than three years old 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.950
 the market 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.680
 the Germans have a good competition 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.880
 able to study and especially the most 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.880
 heard negatives 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.430
 a number on the Toyota for example 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.040
 does not get their hands on everyone 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.140
 each other that there must be people 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.450
 who do not like the opel but 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.890
 the ampera is low in stock like one 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.140
 sports car 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.479
 that type of car actually puts people 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.220
 gladly for the door you have to be kind 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.690
 take it off when you can hit the ground 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.690
 when taking a speed bump 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.590
 the ampera is not only in a flash 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:43.119
 jacket he is also motorized whole 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.560
 different in each other 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.240
 an electric motor provides the 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.770
 main drive 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.780
 but there is also a gasoline engine 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.970
 the hood in case the power touches 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.160
 that gasoline engine, incidentally, does not float 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.020
 to offer but the battery 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.430
 You flow to the receiver outlet 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.430
 or from the pump 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.710
 the toyota relies primarily on 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.950
 his gasoline engine 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.970
 the electric motor particularly in jumping 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.670
 Japanese have an extra battery 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.530
 mounted to cover greater distances completely 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.200
 being able to drive electrically 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.480
 but even when the power is off the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.049
 plugin prius very economical because it stays 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.970
 in the boss is a hybrid car 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.430
 Another big advantage of the Toyota 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.049
 is his interior space he offers space 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.450
 to 5 people 

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:31.090
 plus a luggage and that in generous 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.430
 dimensions in the opel you can but it 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.390
 best for sitting and not too much 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.390
 want to take luggage with you 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.049
 look eye for detail 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.360
 toyota has a special profession in the 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.260
 luggage room where you lose the charging cable 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.940
 can 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.310
 That way you do when it rains 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.489
 none had the cables between your luggage too 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.489
 to lay 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.380
 Also at Opel they know it is a small one 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.960
 things are doing it and so does the 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.230
 just a special horn for cyclists 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.230
 and pedestrians 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.200
 after all, it remains an electrical one 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.239
 car and you don't hear that 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.310
 when you are almost identical 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.450
 twin brother the chevrolet volt not 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.430
 counts 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.760
 is the opel ampera but in a taste too 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.790
 for more than 48,000 euros 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:24.310
 then you have a car with all the trimmings 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.700
 from leather upholstery and navigation to 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.920
 a charging point at your home and at the office 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.030
 the toyota prius is just about none 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:32.680
 40 mille 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.660
 you may miss in the basic version 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.580
 some bells and whistles but a charging point 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.540
 at home you get there anyway 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.540
 free with 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.880
 you can drive no less than 60 km with the 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:45.010
 ampera 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.530
 fully on power and then you can still 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.450
 speeding if allowed too 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.640
 Toyota turns on the gasoline engine 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.180
 when you drive faster than electrically 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:57.459
 85 km per hour or when you eat it 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:00.459
 is of 20 fully electric 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:04.500
 kilometers the prius plug-in is with that 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:04.500
 especially suitable for in the city 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.620
 but the toyota is in an hour and a half 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:11.480
 about the charged 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.890
 it is the largest of the two as the 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.500
 power on is still one 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.500
 hybrid and he is the cheapest 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.289
 nice
