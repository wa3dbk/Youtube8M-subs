paracord<00:01:39.380> we'll<00:01:39.500> talk<00:01:39.620> about<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.950> in<00:01:40.190> a

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
paracord we'll talk about that in a

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.760 
paracord we'll talk about that in a
moment<00:01:40.970> but<00:01:41.450> as<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:42.260> see<00:01:42.409> on<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.590> back<00:01:42.710> here

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
moment but as you see on the back here

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.760 
moment but as you see on the back here
you<00:01:43.250> can<00:01:43.580> mount<00:01:43.730> this<00:01:43.880> on<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.090> belt<00:01:44.390> so

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
you can mount this on a belt so

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.750 
you can mount this on a belt so
basically<00:01:45.770> you<00:01:45.890> push<00:01:46.070> these<00:01:46.190> two<00:01:46.400> little<00:01:46.610> tabs

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:46.760 
basically you push these two little tabs

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:50.440 
basically you push these two little tabs
in<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:48.080> this<00:01:48.260> thing<00:01:48.440> slides<00:01:49.370> out<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:50.240> put

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450

your<00:01:50.479> belt<00:01:50.750> through<00:01:50.900> there<00:01:51.110> and<00:01:51.260> you<00:01:51.860> can<00:01:52.040> take

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
your belt through there and you can take

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.730 
your belt through there and you can take
this<00:01:52.400> piece<00:01:52.460> off<00:01:52.909> and<00:01:53.150> spin<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:53.750> so<00:01:54.320> that<00:01:54.560> you

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
this piece off and spin it so that you

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.280 
this piece off and spin it so that you
can<00:01:54.890> actually<00:01:55.040> carry<00:01:55.490> it<00:01:55.870> as<00:01:56.870> you<00:01:57.020> can<00:01:57.140> see

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
about six and a half inches the blade is

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.350 
about six and a half inches the blade is
2.75<00:03:22.440> inches<00:03:22.829> you're<00:03:23.430> thickness<00:03:23.910> for<00:03:24.269> the

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
2.75 inches you're thickness for the

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.550 
2.75 inches you're thickness for the
blade<00:03:24.600> which<00:03:24.989> let<00:03:25.170> me<00:03:25.200> show<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.410> that<00:03:25.440> real

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
blade which let me show you that real

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.289 
blade which let me show you that real
quick<00:03:25.790> is<00:03:26.790> about<00:03:27.030> 0.14<00:03:27.810> inches<00:03:29.060> so<00:03:30.060> it's<00:03:30.209> going

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
quick is about 0.14 inches so it's going

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.030 
quick is about 0.14 inches so it's going
to<00:03:30.360> be<00:03:30.450> a<00:03:30.510> good<00:03:30.660> sturdy<00:03:30.870> blade<00:03:31.140> obviously<00:03:31.890> this

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
to be a good sturdy blade obviously this

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.590 
to be a good sturdy blade obviously this
is<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.220> full<00:03:32.519> tang<00:03:32.730> knife<00:03:32.970> which<00:03:33.180> means<00:03:33.420> that

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
is a full tang knife which means that

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.030 
is a full tang knife which means that
it's<00:03:33.720> one<00:03:33.870> huge<00:03:34.230> piece<00:03:34.350> of<00:03:34.530> metal<00:03:34.799> and<00:03:34.920> the

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
it's one huge piece of metal and the

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.620 
it's one huge piece of metal and the
metal<00:03:35.220> runs<00:03:35.730> all<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:35.940> way<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.360> end<00:03:36.510> of<00:03:36.570> the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
metal runs all the way to the end of the

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:39.050 
metal runs all the way to the end of the
handle<00:03:36.959> this<00:03:37.110> is<00:03:37.260> not<00:03:37.410> a<00:03:37.440> folding<00:03:37.890> knife<00:03:37.920> so<00:03:38.670> if

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
handle this is not a folding knife so if

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.069 
handle this is not a folding knife so if
you're<00:03:39.180> looking<00:03:39.239> for<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> folding<00:03:39.780> knife<00:03:39.810> this

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.990 
you're looking for a folding knife this
is<00:03:40.140> definite<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.769> one<00:03:40.890> for<00:03:41.130> you

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 
is definite the one for you

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.250 
is definite the one for you
like<00:03:42.900> I<00:03:43.019> said<00:03:43.260> it<00:03:43.410> is<00:03:43.670> it's<00:03:44.670> it's<00:03:45.360> compact<00:03:46.049> it's

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
like I said it is it's it's compact it's

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:47.539 
like I said it is it's it's compact it's
a<00:03:46.350> small<00:03:46.590> knife<00:03:46.799> your<00:03:47.040> hand<00:03:47.250> doesn't<00:03:47.489> totally

00:03:47.539 --> 00:03:47.549 
a small knife your hand doesn't totally

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:48.080 
a small knife your hand doesn't totally
fit<00:03:47.820> on<00:03:47.910> it

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
fit on it

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.910 
fit on it
when<00:03:48.480> I<00:03:48.510> first<00:03:48.870> saw<00:03:49.079> this<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:49.500> thought<00:03:49.530> it<00:03:49.799> was

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
when I first saw this I thought it was

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.470 
when I first saw this I thought it was
actually<00:03:50.459> quite<00:03:50.730> a<00:03:50.760> bit<00:03:50.940> longer<00:03:51.120> so<00:03:51.209> I<00:03:51.299> thought

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
actually quite a bit longer so I thought

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.270 
actually quite a bit longer so I thought
the<00:03:51.600> blade<00:03:51.840> was<00:03:52.019> closer<00:03:52.620> to<00:03:52.860> like<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.190> know

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
the blade was closer to like you know

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.580 
the blade was closer to like you know
four<00:03:53.579> inches<00:03:53.970> when<00:03:54.840> I<00:03:54.870> finally<00:03:55.140> got<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.440> out<00:03:55.530> I

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
four inches when I finally got it out I

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:56.750 
four inches when I finally got it out I
thought<00:03:55.769> man<00:03:55.950> this<00:03:56.040> is<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.220> great<00:03:56.549> little

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
thought man this is a great little

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.390 
thought man this is a great little

Ives grind for penetrating power and

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:39.570 
Ives grind for penetrating power and
it's<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.590> lot<00:04:38.680> of<00:04:38.710> fancy<00:04:38.950> words<00:04:39.100> but

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
it's a lot of fancy words but

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.640 
it's a lot of fancy words but
essentially<00:04:40.090> nice<00:04:40.690> blade<00:04:40.930> for<00:04:41.140> cutting<00:04:41.170> and

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.060 
think this Kydex sheath is really it's
nice<00:06:16.450> it's<00:06:16.750> nicely<00:06:16.930> made<00:06:17.230> it's<00:06:17.410> kayak<00:06:17.800> so<00:06:17.950> it's

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
nice it's nicely made it's kayak so it's

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:20.340 
nice it's nicely made it's kayak so it's
high<00:06:18.190> quality<00:06:18.610> and<00:06:18.790> then<00:06:19.420> if<00:06:19.960> these<00:06:20.110> guys<00:06:20.290> are

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:20.350 
high quality and then if these guys are
