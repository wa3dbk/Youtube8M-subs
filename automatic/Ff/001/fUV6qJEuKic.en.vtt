think I paid say 35 dollars for that you

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.260 
think I paid say 35 dollars for that you
can<00:03:05.980> also<00:03:06.130> use<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.550> Harbor<00:03:06.850> Freight<00:03:07.120> weed<00:03:08.220> the

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
can also use the Harbor Freight weed the

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.210 
can also use the Harbor Freight weed the
weed<00:03:10.270> torch<00:03:10.630> you<00:03:11.320> find<00:03:11.560> that<00:03:11.710> on<00:03:11.860> Harbor

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
weed torch you find that on Harbor

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.060 
weed torch you find that on Harbor
Freight<00:03:12.600> and<00:03:13.600> simply<00:03:14.020> you<00:03:14.140> would<00:03:14.290> attach<00:03:14.560> you

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
Freight and simply you would attach you

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.820 
Freight and simply you would attach you
would<00:03:15.190> disconnect<00:03:15.550> the<00:03:15.760> end<00:03:16.150> of<00:03:16.330> that<00:03:16.450> and

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
would disconnect the end of that and

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.400 
would disconnect the end of that and
connect<00:03:17.830> it<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.010> a<00:03:18.190> quarter<00:03:18.730> inch<00:03:18.780> pipe<00:03:19.780> here

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
connect it to a quarter inch pipe here

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:26.300 
connect it to a quarter inch pipe here
like<00:03:20.740> I<00:03:20.890> did<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.790> you<00:03:22.600> could<00:03:22.720> use<00:03:22.870> that<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:25.510> uh

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
like I did and you could use that and uh

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:33.479 
like I did and you could use that and uh
what<00:03:27.310> else<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:29.530> crucible<00:03:30.040> I<00:03:32.280> got<00:03:33.280> another

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
what else the crucible I got another

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.020 
what else the crucible I got another
crucible<00:03:34.170> which<00:03:36.150> is<00:03:37.150> four<00:03:37.480> inches<00:03:37.660> this<00:03:38.290> one

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
crucible which is four inches this one

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:45.900 
crucible which is four inches this one
this<00:03:40.030> one<00:03:40.239> is<00:03:40.270> uh<00:03:41.970> six<00:03:42.970> inches<00:03:44.520> and<00:03:45.520> obviously

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:45.910 
this one is uh six inches and obviously

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.270 
this one is uh six inches and obviously
you<00:03:46.120> want<00:03:46.300> to<00:03:46.680> try<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.739> match<00:03:47.950> up<00:03:47.980> your

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:48.280 
you want to try to match up your

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:49.560 
you want to try to match up your
crucible<00:03:48.610> to<00:03:48.820> what<00:03:48.970> you're<00:03:49.120> melting<00:03:49.300> you

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:49.570 
crucible to what you're melting you

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.990 
crucible to what you're melting you
don't<00:03:49.750> want<00:03:49.900> to<00:03:50.020> melt<00:03:50.770> a<00:03:50.890> small<00:03:51.220> amount<00:03:51.790> of

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
don't want to melt a small amount of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.140 
don't want to melt a small amount of
metal<00:03:52.300> in<00:03:52.450> a<00:03:52.840> huge<00:03:53.110> crucible<00:03:53.970> because<00:03:54.970> you'll

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
metal in a huge crucible because you'll

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.490 
metal in a huge crucible because you'll
be<00:03:55.620> using<00:03:56.620> a<00:03:57.070> lot<00:03:57.700> of<00:03:57.910> energy<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:59.260> heat<00:03:59.290> up

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
be using a lot of energy to heat up

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.650 
be using a lot of energy to heat up
something<00:03:59.860> that<00:04:00.190> it's<00:04:01.260> there's<00:04:02.260> no<00:04:02.380> need<00:04:02.560> for

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
something that it's there's no need for

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:08.100 
something that it's there's no need for
yeah<00:04:04.660> basically<00:04:05.580> this<00:04:06.580> is<00:04:06.790> a<00:04:07.110> quarter-inch

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
yeah basically this is a quarter-inch

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:14.940 
yeah basically this is a quarter-inch
thick<00:04:10.590> six<00:04:11.590> and<00:04:11.739> five<00:04:11.890> eighths<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:13.680> I<00:04:14.680> just

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:14.950 
thick six and five eighths and I just

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.380 
thick six and five eighths and I just
welded<00:04:15.940> a<00:04:16.260> plate<00:04:17.260> at<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.680> bottom<00:04:18.120> with<00:04:19.120> three

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
welded a plate at the bottom with three

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.080 
welded a plate at the bottom with three
root<00:04:19.570> passes<00:04:20.220> and<00:04:21.220> she's<00:04:21.549> holding<00:04:21.820> up<00:04:21.880> pretty

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
root passes and she's holding up pretty

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.870 
root passes and she's holding up pretty
good<00:04:22.180> over<00:04:22.780> here<00:04:22.810> I<00:04:22.990> put<00:04:23.530> in<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.710> thick<00:04:24.460> washer

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
good over here I put in a thick washer

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.840 
good over here I put in a thick washer
which<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:26.050> use<00:04:26.860> to<00:04:28.200> pivot<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:30.250> crucible<00:04:30.729> and

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
which I use to pivot the crucible and

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.150 
which I use to pivot the crucible and
pour<00:04:31.300> the<00:04:31.390> metal<00:04:31.540> out<00:04:31.750> two<00:04:32.320> nuts<00:04:32.530> on<00:04:32.650> the<00:04:32.770> sides

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
pour the metal out two nuts on the sides

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:41.780 
pour the metal out two nuts on the sides
that's<00:04:33.700> all<00:04:33.880> it<00:04:33.970> is

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:41.790
