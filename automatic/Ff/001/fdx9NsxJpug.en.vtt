00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
the edge of my cutting surface so that I

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.600 
the edge of my cutting surface so that I
can<00:02:04.180> make<00:02:04.510> some<00:02:04.810> at<00:02:05.020> first<00:02:05.320> horizontal<00:02:05.800> slices

crossing<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.340> imaginary<00:02:17.880> line<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.180> we

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
crossing that imaginary line that we

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.400 
crossing that imaginary line that we
have<00:02:19.400> and<00:02:20.400> when<00:02:20.520> I<00:02:20.550> cut<00:02:20.820> across<00:02:21.360> dunya<00:02:21.930> now<00:02:22.110> I

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
into the bowl with the onions maybe I

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.020 
into the bowl with the onions maybe I
could<00:02:30.270> give<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.540> stir<00:02:30.690> around<00:02:30.960> in<00:02:32.030> okay

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
could give that a stir around in okay
