00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 would you like your computer to be 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.339
 really protected from trojan viruses 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.379
 and other contagion 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.480
 and on this site I present my 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.550
 training video course for money under 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.769
 name computer protection method 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.020
 trickster richter is my nickname 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.369
 Internet and the course, respectively, is also my 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.439
 what will this course give you 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.359
 this course will teach you how to really 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.230
 protect your computer from malware 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.359
 of programs 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 instead of the illusion of protection which gives you 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.900
 antivirus this course will teach you how 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.820
 make of your computer 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.890
 really impregnable fortress 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.230
 the fact is that in the vast majority 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.690
 cases antiviruses really give 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.520
 just the illusion of protecting the computer for sure 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.680
 There are many cases when 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.360
 computer seems to have antivirus installed 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.040
 however the computer still turns 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.100
 infected and stops working normally 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.629
 until if someone else has ever seen mine 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.879
 video called trustworthy 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.850
 Antivirus can look 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.829
 link here below is the first video of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.199
 this course and here you can it 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.960
 see absolutely free of which 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.300
 my training course consists of 1 connector 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.820
 courses tells about what the main 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.070
 settings need to be done immediately after 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.860
 install the operating system so that your 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.020
 the computer was really protected from 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.640
 malware impacts are also 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.439
 you will know what types of sets are 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.509
 programs why antivirus with them is not 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.090
 cope and so on after 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.180
 study this part of the course if you are all 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.009
 do it right your computer will 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:28.439
 have immunity for most 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.979
 computer threats but in the second section 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.150
 we will develop this system to the maximum you 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.780
 learn what action is necessary 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.040
 to undertake 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.570
 at least once a month to your computer 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.150
 stayed healthy and guaranteed 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.130
 clean from turned out programs you will learn 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.869
 how to clean malicious 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.369
 programs from the computer if they are on it 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.470
 still hit most 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.240
 users makes a lot of mistakes when 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.829
 uninstalling returned programs and in 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.960
 as a result of their actions, it can 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.360
 harm the whole system or they can 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.850
 remove portable programs not 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.730
 completely or as a result of erroneous 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.260
 action 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.360
 remote malware can 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.790
 back to computer again 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.780
 at least calculate them all under the root here 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:09.670
 how to make them no longer 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.490
 returned how to avoid all these 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.230
 mistakes you learn from this course you 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.120
 also find out what to do if viruses 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.370
 block access to the Internet 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.230
 you will learn how to protect unrest bending from 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.030
 redirects to other sites 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.460
 those who have already seen my early videos 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.730
 probably remember this unpleasant thing 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.500
 when you wash one site address 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.080
 and throws you on a completely different 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.540
 how to attack and get rid of it 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:36.520
 defend yourself too in this course told 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.020
 you know what to do if viruses 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.670
 already on your computer if 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.630
 prevention and to engage too late 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.790
 need to clean 

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.650
 what has accumulated there you will find out that 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.780
 do if the virus blocks the launch 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.610
 programs you learn what to do if 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.010
 in general, the computer is completely blocked 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.290
 malware and they don't want 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.110
 let you in until you pay them 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.720
 money is the so -called program 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:01.060
 extortionist think that many of them already 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.530
 heard about some probably already personally with 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.270
 they met here from them 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.130
 we also learn how to get rid of you 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:08.920
 learn how to get rid of rootkits 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.920
 of them I have already told my subscribers 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.080
 mailings about this already know it 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.090
 programs that hide in your 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.890
 computer very deep in the depths of your 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:20.920
 systems 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.930
 simple ways they do not corrode tsa 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.459
 and at the same time they help to hide and 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.290
 disguise other malicious 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.720
 programs trojan virus and so on 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.700
 This is one of the reasons why many do not 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.330
 it turns out to completely rid your 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:36.340
 computer from the chain of infection you will learn 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.989
 what programs should be used in 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.750
 anti-resonance 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.950
 and how to use them is not antiviruses 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.959
 they ca n't hang around you all the time 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.550
 memory and not interfere with your work you 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.260
 learn how to properly use these 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.510
 programs it is clear that the program itself 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.970
 alone is not able to solve this problem 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.030
 as a computer protection, I have a thousand times 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.300
 said it all depends on the user 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:59.590
 This is a comprehensive system of measures + 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.380
 tuning plus skillful use 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.080
 programs all this in total 

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:07.890
 help you to truly protect your 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:09.430
 computer from looking back programs this 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:11.230
 holistic system 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:13.150
 it is useless to pull out some 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.520
 individual lessons she works exactly 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.519
 then when it passes all entirely and 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.680
 This system is quite easy to learn. 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.290
 I managed to train and even my neighbor 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.330
 retirees who are 72 years old and now 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.970
 people turn to him for help when 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.950
 does not start to keep stuff 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:32.200
 of course in order to master this 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.400
 system basic skills to work on 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.110
 computer still has 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.840
 conduct an educational program on how to copy 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.880
 file or how to create a folder I'm in this 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.680
 course will not what else will this 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.450
 course I will not read you 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.210
 Antivirus guide and 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:48.130
 tell how to install them like this 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:50.350
 do on most courses on fighting 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.240
 viruses and if you need 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:54.700
 guide to any antivirus I think 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.200
 that you are able to read it yourself for 

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:58.330
 order this training video course 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:00.310
 not necessarily this course of course 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:02.290
 It does not make you a super specialists in 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.580
 computer security is not an option 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.290
 become a top-class specialist 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.050
 watching the video course how this course does not 

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:09.550
 was but you will have enough knowledge for 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.770
 protect your computer from 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.110
 viruses and clean your computer from viruses 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.210
 and it's not there yes but not only your 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:18.729
 Generally this course contains knowledge 

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:21.910
 that will help you protect your computer 

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:24.310
 without antivirus so this is the knowledge 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.039
 which antivirus companies are not very 

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:29.740
 would like you to know them in what 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.190
 the root difference of this video course from 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.229
 the rest 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.090
 most computer courses when 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.680
 all such shock security windows 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.490
 recommend using antivirus 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.110
 I'll show you how to install 

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.450
 antivirus and tell you how to configure it 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.580
 worst case they'll just read you 

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.700
 Antivirus help here is not 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:51.249
 will be especially since the effectiveness of all 

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:53.199
 these antiviruses you probably already saw 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:55.209
 who have not yet seen again recall that 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:57.999
 video called trustworthy 

00:05:55.209 --> 00:05:58.569
 antivirus here here a little lower on 

00:05:57.999 --> 00:06:00.479
 this page 

00:05:58.569 --> 00:06:03.009
 my course contains information 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.379
 which will not teach you on computer 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.189
 courses and you will not find it in most 

00:06:05.379 --> 00:06:07.839
 computer books 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:10.179
 This information tells how 

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:12.309
 really protect your computer from 

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:14.709
 viruses and if everyone will use 

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:16.959
 this information is the antivirus company 

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:19.239
 left without customers that's why 

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:21.699
 this information is hidden 

00:06:19.239 --> 00:06:24.189
 from most of this information received 

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.239
 by practical research 

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:28.029
 practical developments 

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:30.369
 thanks to more than 20 years of experience 

00:06:28.029 --> 00:06:33.129
 work on computers how much will 

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:35.739
 worth this course I immediately say that 

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.689
 I have no task to sell this course to everyone and 

00:06:35.739 --> 00:06:40.089
 everyone because if everyone starts 

00:06:37.689 --> 00:06:41.739
 use this knowledge antivirus 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:44.259
 companies do n't like this much 

00:06:41.739 --> 00:06:47.019
 violates their business and the measures they will take 

00:06:44.259 --> 00:06:49.629
 fast enough so the price threshold 

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:52.209
 be high enough I could calmly 

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:54.269
 would sell this course for 5 thousand ten 

00:06:52.209 --> 00:06:57.399
 thousand rubles or even 15,000 rubles 

00:06:54.269 --> 00:06:58.949
 however today I offer you for 3 with 

00:06:57.399 --> 00:07:00.729
 half a thousand Russian rubles 

00:06:58.949 --> 00:07:02.619
 let's call this fee 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:05.079
 a kind of filter that allows 

00:07:02.619 --> 00:07:07.119
 I have to deal with those responsible, and only 

00:07:05.079 --> 00:07:09.009
 acting people who are ready 

00:07:07.119 --> 00:07:11.110
 really practice for information in 

00:07:09.009 --> 00:07:13.299
 business and so weed out those who 

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:15.819
 just idle curiosity and prices 

00:07:13.299 --> 00:07:18.309
 my courses are gradually increasing and constantly 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:20.289
 grow so if you want to be in time 

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:22.659
 grab a course at this price go 

00:07:20.289 --> 00:07:24.879
 right now to the very bottom of this page 

00:07:22.659 --> 00:07:28.169
 and click place order 

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:28.169
 and all you good
