00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
the homeowner this tool does a couple

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.130 
the homeowner this tool does a couple
different<00:00:28.130> things<00:00:28.160> I<00:00:28.899> mentioned<00:00:29.899> the<00:00:29.960> right

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
different things I mentioned the right

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.799 
different things I mentioned the right
angle<00:00:30.500> impact<00:00:31.099> driver<00:00:31.369> so<00:00:32.090> it<00:00:32.390> acts<00:00:32.570> as<00:00:32.720> the

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:32.809 
angle impact driver so it acts as the

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:34.299 
angle impact driver so it acts as the
impact<00:00:33.079> driver<00:00:33.290> able<00:00:33.770> to<00:00:33.829> get<00:00:33.950> into<00:00:34.160> tight

00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:34.309 
impact driver able to get into tight

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.530 
impact driver able to get into tight
places<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:35.530> with<00:00:36.530> a<00:00:36.559> flip<00:00:36.890> of<00:00:37.010> the<00:00:37.070> switch<00:00:37.540> you

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:38.540 
places and with a flip of the switch you

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.780 
places and with a flip of the switch you
can<00:00:38.690> switch<00:00:38.930> it<00:00:39.080> over<00:00:39.140> to<00:00:39.260> a<00:00:39.380> hammer<00:00:39.680> so<00:00:40.520> it

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
can switch it over to a hammer so it

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.530 
can switch it over to a hammer so it
will<00:00:41.000> actually<00:00:42.970> actually<00:00:43.970> act<00:00:44.150> as<00:00:44.240> an<00:00:44.390> auto

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:44.540 
will actually actually act as an auto

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.330 
will actually actually act as an auto
hammer<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.590> let's<00:00:45.830> go<00:00:45.950> over<00:00:46.010> some<00:00:46.190> of<00:00:46.220> the

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
hammer so let's go over some of the

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.540 
hammer so let's go over some of the
features<00:00:46.430> of<00:00:46.850> course<00:00:47.090> got<00:00:47.690> an<00:00:47.780> LED<00:00:48.140> light

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550

impact driver it's got the quarter inch

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:58.930 
impact driver it's got the quarter inch
shank<00:00:54.590> so<00:00:54.890> it<00:00:54.980> will<00:00:55.070> receive<00:00:57.760> quarter<00:00:58.760> inch

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
shank so it will receive quarter inch

I<00:01:08.369> think<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.450> called<00:01:09.600> an<00:01:09.720> animal<00:01:10.079> here<00:01:10.290> this

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
I think it's called an animal here this

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.170 
I think it's called an animal here this
is<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> hammer<00:01:11.100> attachment<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:11.790> has<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.060> be

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
is the hammer attachment that has to be

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.510 
is the hammer attachment that has to be
on<00:01:12.299> the<00:01:12.420> tool<00:01:12.570> uses<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> hammer<00:01:13.290> and<00:01:13.619> then<00:01:14.220> a

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
on the tool uses as a hammer and then a

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.260 
on the tool uses as a hammer and then a
Philips<00:01:14.909> bit<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.860> anvil<00:01:17.250> will<00:01:17.579> store<00:01:18.030> on

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
Philips bit the anvil will store on

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.050 
Philips bit the anvil will store on
board<00:01:18.539> but<00:01:19.530> some<00:01:20.189> reason<00:01:20.520> they<00:01:20.640> didn't<00:01:20.939> make

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
board but some reason they didn't make

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.649 
board but some reason they didn't make
any<00:01:21.270> place<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.899> store<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.289> Philips<00:01:22.590> bit<00:01:22.799> so<00:01:23.729> I

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
any place to store the Philips bit so I

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.630 
any place to store the Philips bit so I
guess<00:01:25.229> maybe<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.770> lot<00:01:25.920> of<00:01:26.009> people<00:01:26.220> have<00:01:26.340> Philips

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
guess maybe a lot of people have Philips

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.370 
guess maybe a lot of people have Philips
books<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.090> I<00:01:27.299> would<00:01:27.990> have<00:01:28.080> thought<00:01:28.200> they

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
books but I would have thought they

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.719 
books but I would have thought they
didn't<00:01:28.560> want<00:01:28.679> to<00:01:28.770> store<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.039> it

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
didn't want to store it it

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.340 
didn't want to store it it

holy cow is that loud um that took a lot
of<00:03:29.560> effort<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:30.580> sync<00:03:30.849> that<00:03:30.909> I<00:03:31.330> think<00:03:32.290> it<00:03:32.379> almost

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
of effort to sync that I think it almost

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.720 
of effort to sync that I think it almost
would<00:03:32.739> have<00:03:32.799> been<00:03:32.950> easier<00:03:33.250> to<00:03:33.310> turn<00:03:33.580> this

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
would have been easier to turn this

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.199 
would have been easier to turn this
around<00:03:33.879> and<00:03:34.360> just<00:03:34.629> hammer<00:03:35.049> the<00:03:35.319> nail<00:03:35.500> in<00:03:36.209> it

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
around and just hammer the nail in it

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.930 
around and just hammer the nail in it
did<00:03:37.420> think<00:03:37.720> that<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.310> other<00:03:39.310> straight<00:03:39.730> bit

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
did think that the other straight bit

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.390 
did think that the other straight bit
here<00:03:40.150> straight<00:03:40.870> nail<00:03:41.080> I<00:03:41.110> was<00:03:41.349> trying<00:03:41.620> this<00:03:42.280> is

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
here straight nail I was trying this is

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.580 
here straight nail I was trying this is
what<00:03:42.549> it's<00:03:42.700> an<00:03:43.620> 88<00:03:44.620> d<00:03:44.890> two<00:03:45.099> and<00:03:45.250> a<00:03:45.280> half<00:03:45.459> inch

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
what it's an 88 d two and a half inch

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.780 
what it's an 88 d two and a half inch
actually<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.650> think<00:03:47.709> it<00:03:47.950> says<00:03:48.129> it'll<00:03:48.310> drive<00:03:48.549> two

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
actually I think it says it'll drive two

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:51.920 
actually I think it says it'll drive two
and<00:03:48.910> a<00:03:48.940> half<00:03:49.120> inch<00:03:49.329> nails<00:03:49.569> not<00:03:50.530> three<00:03:50.909> nails

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
and a half inch nails not three nails

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.420 
and a half inch nails not three nails
two<00:03:52.930> and<00:03:53.079> a<00:03:53.110> half<00:03:53.230> it<00:03:53.560> says<00:03:53.769> it<00:03:53.860> does<00:03:53.980> eat<00:03:54.220> D

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
two and a half it says it does eat D

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.750 
two and a half it says it does eat D
uncoated<00:03:54.910> I<00:03:55.900> was<00:03:56.799> trying<00:03:57.010> this<00:03:57.129> earlier<00:03:57.489> and

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
uncoated I was trying this earlier and

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.580 
uncoated I was trying this earlier and
it<00:03:58.120> would<00:03:58.299> not<00:03:58.480> sink<00:03:58.780> this<00:03:58.930> one<00:03:59.140> so<00:03:59.290> let's<00:03:59.440> give

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
it would not sink this one so let's give

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:14.890 
it would not sink this one so let's give
it<00:03:59.620> another<00:03:59.709> shot

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.440 

it<00:04:15.900> is<00:04:16.019> essentially<00:04:16.680> stopped<00:04:17.040> so<00:04:17.459> it<00:04:17.790> was

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
it is essentially stopped so it was

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.800 
it is essentially stopped so it was
unable<00:04:18.750> to<00:04:19.079> sink<00:04:19.560> that<00:04:19.680> ad<00:04:20.070> now<00:04:20.480> here's<00:04:21.480> a<00:04:21.540> ring

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 
unable to sink that ad now here's a ring

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.060 
unable to sink that ad now here's a ring
and<00:04:21.959> I<00:04:22.019> should've<00:04:22.320> had<00:04:22.440> hearing<00:04:22.740> protection

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
and I should've had hearing protection

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.920 
and I should've had hearing protection
on<00:04:23.250> because<00:04:23.520> this<00:04:23.640> is<00:04:23.700> one<00:04:24.000> loud<00:04:24.180> unit<00:04:24.480> never
