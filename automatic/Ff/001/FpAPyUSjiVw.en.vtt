00:00:04.879 --> 00:00:12.059
 We will try 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.710
 arms in mittens for this test i 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:18.510
 chose the thickest 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.660
 not the thickest glove like a glove 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.420
 we all know glove 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.630
 bessey diver 7 millimeters this is 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:31.579
 the thickest glove is not mittens yet 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:38.430
 I repeat once again in the market of spearfishing 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:42.390
 so people understand that distance 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:46.219
 between the fingers increases due to 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:50.489
 double word layer neoprene 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.289
 therefore in the seven mitts and hands 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.120
 will be still free 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:01:03.619
 the pig of my palm is almost 100 millimeters 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:06.270
 four finger size gloves and 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:09.240
 almost to be honest she 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.630
 Well, I can not say so cramped I 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:18.330
 It was, but let's say, you can see it here 7 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:20.000
 or translation we observe how lies 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.130
 me in hand 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:28.250
 why am I lighting this moment this moment 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:31.259
 not a little important to be comfortable 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:36.479
 Underwater hunter hold gun 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:40.619
 themselves in the hands and on the forum was a discussion 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:44.759
 that I did not later who wrote that the handle 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.340
 little well I want to tell you here is mine 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.570
 hand roughly speaking 100 millimeters by 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.030
 four knuckles letting the gloves not 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.750
 mittens center my attention 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.290
 7 millimeters lies loose in this 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:06.869
 handles a creek principle is a sequel 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:09.959
 Look guys in public hands no 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:13.500
 interest from pelengas I have 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.950
 No, well, look, Rushil continues 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.370
 hand she goes a continuation of the hand itself 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.739
 very comfortable and very comfortable and now 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.190
 look how long I have him 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:31.080
 hold on the outstretched hand 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:33.470
 how easy is the weapon and you 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:39.780
 see that your hand is not trembling 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:42.569
 and from tiredness that is if i feel in 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.660
 arm on the elongated absolutely elongated 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:49.860
 hand because with one hand hold the other 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.720
 hand rents sensing the weight of this on the air 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.810
 shotguns 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.319
 By the way I measure how much water is on it 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.959
 weighs 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:04.320
 if the passport does not find and what its weight 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:07.700
 Naturally I measure it then absolutely not 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:15.320
 straining my hand I think it will be in principle 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:15.320
 comfortable here such and
