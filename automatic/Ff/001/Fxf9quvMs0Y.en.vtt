know<00:01:30.780> his<00:01:31.259> whole<00:01:31.650> thing<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:32.009> about

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
know his whole thing is about

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.550 
know his whole thing is about
popping/animation<00:01:32.869> that's<00:01:33.869> usually<00:01:34.259> like

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
popping/animation that's usually like

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.770 
popping/animation that's usually like
that's<00:01:34.950> fairly<00:01:35.220> easy<00:01:35.520> for<00:01:35.880> me<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.210> think<00:01:36.659> the

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that's fairly easy for me I think the

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.140 
that's fairly easy for me I think the
hardest<00:01:37.079> thing<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.409> me<00:01:37.470> was<00:01:37.740> like

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
hardest thing for me was like

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.910 
hardest thing for me was like
incorporating<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.360> desk<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.930> had<00:01:40.560> to<00:01:40.650> do<00:01:40.770> last

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
incorporating the desk I had to do last

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.740 
incorporating the desk I had to do last
minute<00:01:41.130> changes<00:01:41.670> of<00:01:41.880> choreography<00:01:42.509> like

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
minute changes of choreography like

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.260 
minute changes of choreography like
literally<00:01:43.290> yesterday<00:01:43.649> couldn't<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.399> today<00:01:44.670> so

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
literally yesterday couldn't to today so

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.550 
literally yesterday couldn't to today so
I<00:01:45.299> think<00:01:45.630> that<00:01:45.840> was<00:01:46.020> probably<00:01:46.140> the<00:01:46.350> more

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
I think that was probably the more

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.870 
I think that was probably the more
difficult<00:01:46.740> part<00:01:47.159> for<00:01:47.280> me<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.460> just<00:01:47.700> those

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
difficult part for me was just those

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.300 
difficult part for me was just those
adjustments<00:01:48.380> other<00:01:49.380> than<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> mop<00:01:49.920> being<00:01:50.250> a

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
adjustments other than the mop being a

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.490 
adjustments other than the mop being a
little<00:01:50.490> difficult<00:01:50.909> in<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> beginning<00:01:51.439> um<00:01:52.439> i

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
little difficult in the beginning um i

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.770 
little difficult in the beginning um i
would<00:01:53.070> say<00:01:54.530> making<00:01:55.530> things<00:01:55.799> clear<00:01:56.159> i<00:01:56.689> think<00:01:57.689> in

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
would say making things clear i think in

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:58.969 
would say making things clear i think in
the<00:01:57.869> beginning<00:01:57.990> when<00:01:58.469> when<00:01:58.680> we<00:01:58.770> were<00:01:58.860> first

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
the beginning when when we were first

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.770 
the beginning when when we were first
one<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.369> dance<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.909> was<00:02:00.240> making<00:02:00.600> things

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
one in this dance I was making things

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.720 
one in this dance I was making things
too<00:02:00.990> big<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.409> too<00:02:01.530> um

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
too big and too um

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.180 
too big and too um
like<00:02:03.970> um<00:02:04.300> it<00:02:04.870> just<00:02:04.900> needed<00:02:05.350> like<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.590> sort<00:02:05.980> of

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:06.190 
like um it just needed like a sort of

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.730 
like um it just needed like a sort of
like<00:02:06.510> like<00:02:07.510> no<00:02:07.780> it's<00:02:07.930> not<00:02:08.110> it's<00:02:08.260> not<00:02:08.320> this<00:02:08.560> in

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
like like no it's not it's not this in

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.490 
like like no it's not it's not this in
this<00:02:08.890> it's<00:02:09.280> just<00:02:09.670> it<00:02:10.330> was<00:02:10.540> like<00:02:10.570> it's<00:02:11.200> funny

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
this it's just it was like it's funny

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500 
this it's just it was like it's funny
because<00:02:11.710> it<00:02:12.040> needs<00:02:12.220> to<00:02:12.370> be<00:02:12.520> like<00:02:12.700> stiff<00:02:13.120> but<00:02:13.390> it

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
because it needs to be like stiff but it

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.940 
because it needs to be like stiff but it
needs<00:02:13.660> to<00:02:13.720> be<00:02:13.810> relaxed<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:14.500> and<00:02:14.800> that's

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
needs to be relaxed and and that's

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.620 
needs to be relaxed and and that's
something<00:02:15.310> difficult<00:02:15.820> to<00:02:16.210> teach<00:02:16.420> somebody

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
something difficult to teach somebody

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.860 
something difficult to teach somebody
who<00:02:16.900> hasn't<00:02:17.110> done<00:02:17.860> popping<00:02:18.520> as<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.150> whole<00:02:19.540> and

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
who hasn't done popping as a whole and

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.750 
who hasn't done popping as a whole and

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
because there's a certain like

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.670 
because there's a certain like
relaxation<00:02:22.300> that<00:02:22.630> happens<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.320> you<00:02:23.440> have<00:02:23.560> to

really<00:03:37.780> think<00:03:37.959> like<00:03:38.260> this<00:03:38.680> experience<00:03:39.400> was

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
really think like this experience was

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.360 
really think like this experience was
more<00:03:40.209> difficult<00:03:40.420> because<00:03:40.900> now<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:41.709> work<00:03:42.100> on

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
more difficult because now the work on

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.720 
more difficult because now the work on
the<00:03:42.580> show<00:03:42.790> it's<00:03:43.420> those<00:03:43.660> nerves

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
the show it's those nerves

talked too much this whole journey um
but<00:04:21.479> i<00:04:21.539> would<00:04:21.720> say<00:04:21.900> one<00:04:22.289> one<00:04:22.710> thing<00:04:23.039> would<00:04:23.190> be

but i would say one one thing would be

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.520 
but i would say one one thing would be
to<00:04:23.639> i<00:04:26.660> don't<00:04:27.660> know<00:04:27.750> because<00:04:27.930> they<00:04:28.199> cause<00:04:28.410> it

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
to i don't know because they cause it

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.350 
to i don't know because they cause it
and<00:04:28.740> I<00:04:29.190> would<00:04:29.250> be<00:04:29.400> like<00:04:29.580> the<00:04:29.820> way<00:04:29.910> I<00:04:29.940> performed

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.450 

it's<00:04:33.360> hard<00:04:33.539> it's<00:04:33.690> hard<00:04:33.780> to<00:04:33.990> say<00:04:34.169> because<00:04:34.460> they

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
it's hard it's hard to say because they

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.390 
it's hard it's hard to say because they
didn't<00:04:35.820> give<00:04:35.970> me<00:04:36.000> much<00:04:36.650> you<00:04:37.650> know<00:04:37.740> like<00:04:37.889> advice

didn't give me much you know like advice

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.370 
didn't give me much you know like advice
yeah<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.090> think<00:04:39.210> I<00:04:39.539> think<00:04:39.810> obviously<00:04:39.990> we

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:40.380 
yeah I think I think obviously we

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.629 
yeah I think I think obviously we
listened<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:40.889> judges<00:04:41.370> with<00:04:41.610> their

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
listened to the judges with their

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.850 
listened to the judges with their
critiques<00:04:42.180> when<00:04:42.539> they<00:04:42.630> give<00:04:42.840> it<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:42.990> us<00:04:43.260> but

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
critiques when they give it to us but

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:45.320 
critiques when they give it to us but
it's<00:04:44.039> one<00:04:44.250> of<00:04:44.340> those<00:04:44.430> things<00:04:44.490> that<00:04:44.789> for<00:04:45.210> our

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
it's one of those things that for our

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.710 
it's one of those things that for our
own<00:04:45.510> selves<00:04:45.960> we<00:04:46.139> have<00:04:46.380> our<00:04:46.710> own<00:04:46.740> self

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
own selves we have our own self

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.210 
own selves we have our own self
confidence<00:04:48.720> that<00:04:48.900> we<00:04:49.020> need<00:04:49.200> to<00:04:49.260> build<00:04:49.440> for

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
confidence that we need to build for

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.070 
confidence that we need to build for
ourselves<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.880> it<00:04:51.090> may<00:04:51.270> not<00:04:51.450> be<00:04:51.510> just<00:04:51.900> another

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
ourselves and it may not be just another

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.469 
ourselves and it may not be just another
John<00:04:52.320> Rizzo<00:04:52.470> maybe<00:04:52.710> in<00:04:52.889> our<00:04:52.979> own<00:04:53.250> so<00:04:54.060> I<00:04:54.360> think

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
John Rizzo maybe in our own so I think

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.210 
John Rizzo maybe in our own so I think
the<00:04:54.870> judges<00:04:55.110> always<00:04:55.500> have<00:04:55.680> helpful<00:04:56.070> advice

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
the judges always have helpful advice

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.300 
the judges always have helpful advice
but<00:04:57.030> sometimes<00:04:57.510> it's<00:04:57.750> up<00:04:57.930> to<00:04:58.020> us<00:04:58.050> to<00:04:58.560> you<00:04:59.280> know

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
but sometimes it's up to us to you know

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.830 
but sometimes it's up to us to you know
make<00:04:59.550> sure<00:04:59.610> that<00:04:59.880> we<00:05:00.000> take<00:05:00.030> that<00:05:00.360> advice<00:05:00.570> and

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
make sure that we take that advice and

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.990 
make sure that we take that advice and
we<00:05:01.110> really<00:05:01.800> put<00:05:02.070> it<00:05:02.160> into<00:05:02.430> our<00:05:02.460> daily<00:05:02.729> lives

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:03.000 
we really put it into our daily lives

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.120 
we really put it into our daily lives
into<00:05:03.389> our<00:05:03.539> routines<00:05:03.990> into<00:05:04.320> our<00:05:04.440> dance<00:05:04.680> style

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.130 
into our routines into our dance style

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.540 
into our routines into our dance style
so<00:05:05.760> um<00:05:06.389> yeah<00:05:07.289> honestly<00:05:07.740> I<00:05:07.800> can't<00:05:08.070> pinpoint<00:05:08.310> a
