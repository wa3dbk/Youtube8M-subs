 and if I fail in Aurum then I move here in this 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.170
 Lowlands I can 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.110
 from these two levels so move from top to bottom clock I move 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.670
 from right to left you can see here 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.000
 reaches a messages inbox create messages

 Here I can really move and then in classes ITA 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.120
 For example, I choose the Inbox as easy as that 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.879
 that's the easy option 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.159
 the mission left the key lock if Herta Sternchen bridge 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.159

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:31.349
 yes and now I just write my SMS so you see how it works 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.680
 Add Judges Add Recipients I would have to be here 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.769
 with the 4w thunderstorm down to the news clerk 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:43.439
 Hello 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.599
 then I raced the scholars 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:49.829
 like here I get in the Middle here percent accessibility 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.209
 how does it work a few times now? 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.499
 If I delete form now, namely, keep this key commits 

00:02:57.499 --> 00:03:02.199
 why and if I have not prescribed percent now I can do something in 

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.019
 my correction 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:05.749
 I just want that 

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:09.079
 so back and then I can here 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:13.489
 when I am satisfied on auctions pusher icon in so many multimedia 

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.530
 Add text to feel receivers 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.390
 cut out copying concern found means text recognition writes 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.030
 option 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.559
 Foreword save the station to exit 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:24.089
 so that's it 

00:03:24.089 --> 00:03:28.979
 because if I turned off the real now that after typing help 

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:30.829
 would be clear up here 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.479
 Text recognition off 

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:35.479
 and then I can just accept that way 

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.349
 as you know it from the telephone keypad 

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.489
 Is that possible 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.269
 quite simply I mean here I have no problem with this 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:50.579
 Write device so you write that works if I now percent 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.190
 I would like to add pictures with the 4w thunderstorm one level down 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.019
 then pictures videos zones template in the moor 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:03:59.399
 in Motions ours continue to be satisfied 

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:01.520
 while governments lead and the wars 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.530
 because you distinguish a text message 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.399
 There is not really more to pay attention to 

00:04:06.399 --> 00:04:12.099
 Yaounde I'll show you again how to make a call and that will 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.359

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.440

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.669
 Options I hope 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:35.909
 that's the first time the diversion is active for me 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.800
 After that I will answer my call 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.779

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:42.839
 so in the middle I can now turn on the speaker yes 

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:52.659
 how can I hit the loudspeaker loud or quietly? 

00:04:54.809 --> 00:04:58.009
 Switch loudspeaker option from household funds 

00:04:59.309 --> 00:05:00.960
 to 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.460
 Hermione switch 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.599
 Cups of plates and so on and so on Fischer felt like I was holding 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.680
