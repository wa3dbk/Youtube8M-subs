00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
for on the most part what I did was mix

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.289 
for on the most part what I did was mix
well<00:01:13.920> I<00:01:14.369> took<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.210> pot<00:01:16.009> out<00:01:17.009> of<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:19.250> eyeshadow

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
well I took the pot out of the eyeshadow

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.359 
well I took the pot out of the eyeshadow
so<00:01:21.299> this<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.720> how<00:01:22.320> it<00:01:22.500> comes<00:01:22.680> in<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.159> then

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
so this is how it comes in and then

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.580 
so this is how it comes in and then
there<00:01:23.700> are<00:01:23.729> pots<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.509> there<00:01:25.170> were<00:01:25.290> four<00:01:25.560> I

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
there are pots here there were four I

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.070 
there are pots here there were four I
used<00:01:25.770> like<00:01:26.159> these<00:01:26.460> three<00:01:26.880> we<00:01:27.600> haven't<00:01:27.930> used

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
used like these three we haven't used

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.210 
used like these three we haven't used
this<00:01:28.290> dark<00:01:29.130> blue<00:01:29.340> one<00:01:29.369> yet<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.180> removed<00:01:31.220> this

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
this dark blue one yet so I removed this

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.240 
this dark blue one yet so I removed this
I<00:01:32.460> believe<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.939> like<00:01:33.439> like<00:01:34.439> silver<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:37.250> put

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
I believe is like like silver and put

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.010 
I believe is like like silver and put
them<00:01:38.520> in<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.479> bottle<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.259> then<00:01:40.320> added

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
them in the bottle and then added

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.789 
them in the bottle and then added
rubbing<00:01:43.020> alcohol

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
rubbing alcohol

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.950 
rubbing alcohol
it's<00:01:44.670> like<00:01:45.590> isopropyl<00:01:46.590> alcohol<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.670> then<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
it's like isopropyl alcohol and then a

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.460 
it's like isopropyl alcohol and then a
little<00:01:49.200> bit<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:52.460> hairspray<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:54.540> then<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.170> also

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
little bit of hairspray and then I also

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.039 
little bit of hairspray and then I also
put<00:01:56.130> in

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
put in

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.919 
put in
some<00:01:58.439> glue<00:01:59.090> just<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:02.179> act<00:02:03.179> as<00:02:03.359> a<00:02:03.390> binder

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:03.929 
some glue just to act as a binder

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.490 
some glue just to act as a binder
because<00:02:04.890> when<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.369> I<00:02:05.939> tried<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.659> without<00:02:06.899> well

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
because when I I tried it without well

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.720 
because when I I tried it without well
with<00:02:08.220> with<00:02:08.550> just<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.849> hairspray<00:02:09.269> and<00:02:10.550> in<00:02:11.550> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
with with just a hairspray and in the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.640 
with with just a hairspray and in the
alcohol<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.300> I<00:02:12.420> thought<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:12.840> would<00:02:13.019> work<00:02:13.260> what

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
alcohol and I thought it would work what

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.650 
alcohol and I thought it would work what
was<00:02:13.830> nice<00:02:14.069> because<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.849> trying<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.209> quickly

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
was nice because it trying to quickly

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.030 
was nice because it trying to quickly
but<00:02:16.560> when<00:02:16.799> you<00:02:16.980> touch<00:02:17.629> the<00:02:18.629> surface<00:02:19.040> the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
but when you touch the surface the

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.270 
but when you touch the surface the
glimmer<00:02:20.459> mostly<00:02:20.790> came<00:02:21.000> out<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.019> went<00:02:22.590> in<00:02:22.890> and

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
glimmer mostly came out so I went in and

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.680 
glimmer mostly came out so I went in and
added<00:02:23.489> some<00:02:23.940> gloom

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
added some gloom

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.250 
added some gloom
so<00:02:25.170> that<00:02:25.470> you<00:02:25.769> the<00:02:26.730> the<00:02:27.209> glimmer<00:02:27.420> can<00:02:27.690> stick<00:02:28.019> to

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
so that you the the glimmer can stick to

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.420 
so that you the the glimmer can stick to
them<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.640> surface<00:02:30.090> it's<00:02:30.299> free<00:02:30.920> so<00:02:32.989> that's

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
them to the surface it's free so that's

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.699 
them to the surface it's free so that's
these<00:02:35.430> three<00:02:35.660> this<00:02:36.660> actually<00:02:37.140> came<00:02:37.349> from<00:02:37.380> like

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
first frame and then the rest of them I

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.490 
first frame and then the rest of them I
just<00:03:33.150> makes<00:03:33.420> to<00:03:33.630> put<00:03:33.870> them<00:03:34.049> into<00:03:34.200> these

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
just makes to put them into these

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.190 
just makes to put them into these
separate<00:03:34.950> plastic<00:03:35.579> bottles<00:03:35.910> but<00:03:36.569> what<00:03:36.750> I<00:03:36.780> did

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
separate plastic bottles but what I did

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.750 
separate plastic bottles but what I did
actually<00:03:37.500> was<00:03:38.190> that

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
actually was that

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.429 
actually was that
a<00:03:39.409> small<00:03:40.409> atomizer<00:03:41.360> this<00:03:42.360> isn't<00:03:42.659> my<00:03:42.870> mr.<00:03:43.200> Furth

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:43.439 
a small atomizer this isn't my mr. Furth

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:46.520 
a small atomizer this isn't my mr. Furth
for<00:03:43.739> water<00:03:43.950> when<00:03:44.159> it<00:03:44.340> when<00:03:44.519> I<00:03:44.549> paint<00:03:45.000> but<00:03:45.989> I<00:03:46.170> had

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
for water when it when I paint but I had

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.830 
for water when it when I paint but I had
a<00:03:46.860> spare<00:03:47.400> one<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.060> wasn't<00:03:48.390> using<00:03:48.540> for

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
a spare one that I wasn't using for

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.619 
a spare one that I wasn't using for
anything<00:03:49.049> so<00:03:49.829> what<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.040> did<00:03:50.189> was<00:03:50.730> try<00:03:51.150> out<00:03:51.390> each

00:03:51.619 --> 00:03:51.629 
anything so what I did was try out each

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.559 
anything so what I did was try out each
of<00:03:51.870> the<00:03:51.989> colors<00:03:52.379> and<00:03:52.709> then<00:03:53.030> spray<00:03:54.030> them<00:03:54.269> on<00:03:54.390> a

00:03:54.559 --> 00:03:54.569 
of the colors and then spray them on a

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:58.600 
of the colors and then spray them on a
piece<00:03:54.840> of<00:03:55.230> white<00:03:55.500> cardstock<00:03:56.510> so<00:03:57.510> it's<00:03:57.780> sort<00:03:58.200> of

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:58.610 
piece of white cardstock so it's sort of

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.280 
piece of white cardstock so it's sort of
kindy<00:03:59.610> the<00:03:59.730> sample<00:04:00.239> so<00:04:00.720> you<00:04:00.750> know<00:04:01.019> what<00:04:01.170> it

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
kindy the sample so you know what it

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.460 
kindy the sample so you know what it
looks<00:04:01.500> like<00:04:01.739> sprayed<00:04:02.190> on<00:04:02.340> white<00:04:03.290> this<00:04:04.290> is

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
looks like sprayed on white this is

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.369 
looks like sprayed on white this is
actually<00:04:05.450> this<00:04:06.450> bottle<00:04:07.700> spring<00:04:08.959> so<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:10.109> looks

00:04:10.369 --> 00:04:10.379 
actually this bottle spring so it looks

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.890 
actually this bottle spring so it looks
more<00:04:10.680> like<00:04:12.019> and<00:04:13.019> this<00:04:13.319> actually<00:04:14.069> is<00:04:14.190> not<00:04:14.900> I

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
more like and this actually is not I

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.020 
more like and this actually is not I
made<00:04:16.709> this<00:04:16.859> a<00:04:17.010> while<00:04:17.160> ago<00:04:17.190> like<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.669> few<00:04:18.000> years

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
made this a while ago like a few years

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.979 
made this a while ago like a few years
ago<00:04:18.449> and<00:04:19.289> what<00:04:19.949> I<00:04:19.979> had<00:04:20.340> where<00:04:20.699> those<00:04:20.970> it's<00:04:21.660> like

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989 
ago and what I had where those it's like

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.730 
ago and what I had where those it's like
a<00:04:22.019> glitter<00:04:23.010> pen<00:04:23.580> it's<00:04:24.510> more<00:04:24.990> like<00:04:25.199> pearl<00:04:25.530> ice

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
a glitter pen it's more like pearl ice

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:29.560 
a glitter pen it's more like pearl ice
than<00:04:26.039> glare<00:04:26.280> actually<00:04:26.970> and<00:04:27.449> it<00:04:28.350> was<00:04:28.889> all

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:29.570 
than glare actually and it was all

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:34.570 
than glare actually and it was all
clumpy<00:04:30.570> and<00:04:30.860> so<00:04:31.860> what<00:04:31.949> I<00:04:31.979> did<00:04:32.100> was<00:04:32.539> try<00:04:33.539> to<00:04:33.570> make

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580 
clumpy and so what I did was try to make

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.050 
clumpy and so what I did was try to make
glimmer<00:04:35.580> mist<00:04:35.789> a<00:04:36.500> lot<00:04:37.500> of<00:04:37.680> shame<00:04:37.919> so<00:04:38.820> I<00:04:38.880> just

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 
glimmer mist a lot of shame so I just

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.379 
glimmer mist a lot of shame so I just
dilute<00:04:39.240> it<00:04:39.570> with<00:04:39.600> alcohol<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.590> hairspray<00:04:41.460> and

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
dilute it with alcohol and hairspray and

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.770 
dilute it with alcohol and hairspray and
I<00:04:43.199> noticed<00:04:43.590> that<00:04:43.740> it<00:04:43.889> probably<00:04:44.449> mixed<00:04:45.449> in<00:04:45.599> a

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
I noticed that it probably mixed in a

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.730 
I noticed that it probably mixed in a
lot<00:04:45.990> of<00:04:46.169> hairspray<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:49.669> or<00:04:50.669> alcohol

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
lot of hairspray and or alcohol

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:53.719 
lot of hairspray and or alcohol
evaporated<00:04:52.740> some<00:04:52.979> because<00:04:53.250> when<00:04:53.430> I<00:04:53.460> tried<00:04:53.699> to

00:04:53.719 --> 00:04:53.729 
evaporated some because when I tried to

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.270 
evaporated some because when I tried to
use<00:04:53.940> it<00:04:53.970> again<00:04:54.330> on<00:04:54.870> the<00:04:55.199> the<00:04:55.770> nozzle<00:04:56.130> was

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:56.280 
use it again on the the nozzle was

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.640 
use it again on the the nozzle was
clogged<00:04:57.080> so<00:04:58.080> I<00:04:58.410> diluted<00:04:59.370> it<00:04:59.820> with<00:04:59.849> Morocco

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
clogged so I diluted it with Morocco

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:04.850 
clogged so I diluted it with Morocco
probably<00:05:01.650> begin<00:05:01.919> anew<00:05:02.690> at<00:05:03.690> times<00:05:04.080> early<00:05:04.410> for

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
probably begin anew at times early for

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.110 
probably begin anew at times early for
that

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
that

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.570 
that
so<00:05:05.810> this<00:05:06.530> is<00:05:06.680> this<00:05:06.860> color<00:05:07.190> here<00:05:08.230> has<00:05:09.580> some

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
so this is this color here has some

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.550 
so this is this color here has some
pretty<00:05:10.790> shine<00:05:11.180> there<00:05:11.540> I<00:05:11.900> don't<00:05:12.080> know<00:05:12.199> if<00:05:12.260> it's

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
pretty shine there I don't know if it's

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.870 
pretty shine there I don't know if it's
visible<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:14.000> then<00:05:14.389> this<00:05:14.840> one<00:05:15.139> here<00:05:15.560> sorry<00:05:16.220> I'm

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:25.330 
a sprayed a bit of blue in there is 10
when<00:05:21.380> once<00:05:21.650> bronze<00:05:23.530> this<00:05:24.530> is<00:05:24.590> also<00:05:24.860> from<00:05:25.250> the

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
when once bronze this is also from the

when once bronze this is also from the
glitter<00:05:26.060> glue

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
glitter glue

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.300 
glitter glue
did<00:05:27.680> I<00:05:28.570> bleed<00:05:29.570> into<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.650> brilliant<00:05:30.979> stuff<00:05:31.160> so

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
did I bleed into the brilliant stuff so

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:32.439 
did I bleed into the brilliant stuff so
you<00:05:31.370> can<00:05:31.430> see<00:05:31.669> that<00:05:31.820> we<00:05:31.970> were<00:05:32.090> there<00:05:32.270> in<00:05:32.360> the

you can see that we were there in the

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:39.100 
you can see that we were there in the
bottle<00:05:33.160> and<00:05:34.160> then<00:05:34.220> there's<00:05:34.970> this<00:05:36.520> green<00:05:38.110> it's
