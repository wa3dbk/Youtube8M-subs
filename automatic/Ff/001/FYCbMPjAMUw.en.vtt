00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.649 
up over your head and zip across the
chest<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.700> actually<00:01:56.850> makes<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.360> really

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
chest and it actually makes it really

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.170 
chest and it actually makes it really
easy<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:58.200> get<00:01:58.320> in<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:58.649> out<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.670> one<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.030> the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
easy to get in and out of so one of the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.399 
easy to get in and out of so one of the
the<00:02:01.140> main<00:02:01.409> benefits<00:02:02.340> of<00:02:02.520> having<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.810> chested

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
the main benefits of having a chested

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.059 
the main benefits of having a chested
entry<00:02:05.369> wetsuit<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.930> you<00:02:07.229> eliminate<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
entry wetsuit is that you eliminate the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.040 
entry wetsuit is that you eliminate the
the<00:02:08.640> need<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:09.090> zipper<00:02:09.360> along<00:02:09.720> the<00:02:09.869> back

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
the need for zipper along the back

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.360 
the need for zipper along the back
because<00:02:10.319> now<00:02:10.470> you're<00:02:10.649> no<00:02:10.800> longer<00:02:11.009> getting

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
because now you're no longer getting

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.170 
because now you're no longer getting
into<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.730> wet<00:02:11.849> suit<00:02:12.090> from<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
into the wet suit from the

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.030 
into the wet suit from the
back<00:02:13.329> when<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.019> don't<00:02:14.230> have<00:02:14.379> a<00:02:14.409> zipper<00:02:14.680> along

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
back when you don't have a zipper along

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.069 
back when you don't have a zipper along
the<00:02:15.159> back<00:02:15.430> you<00:02:15.670> actually<00:02:16.180> liberate<00:02:16.659> the<00:02:16.840> suit

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:17.079 
the back you actually liberate the suit

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:19.410 
the back you actually liberate the suit
and<00:02:17.290> allow<00:02:17.859> for<00:02:18.579> more<00:02:18.730> stretch<00:02:19.150> in<00:02:19.329> the

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
and allow for more stretch in the

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.300 
and allow for more stretch in the
material<00:02:19.959> if<00:02:20.079> you<00:02:20.170> had<00:02:20.319> a<00:02:20.349> zipper<00:02:20.709> here<00:02:20.920> you

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
material if you had a zipper here you

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.089 
material if you had a zipper here you
can't<00:02:21.549> really<00:02:22.260> stretch<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.500> zipper<00:02:23.709> because

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:24.099 
can't really stretch the zipper because

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.009 
can't really stretch the zipper because
it's<00:02:24.280> very<00:02:24.459> rigid<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.209> this<00:02:25.359> eliminates<00:02:25.840> the

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
it's very rigid so this eliminates the

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.170 
it's very rigid so this eliminates the
back<00:02:26.230> zip<00:02:26.500> so<00:02:26.680> you<00:02:26.739> can<00:02:26.950> stretch<00:02:27.549> and<00:02:27.730> Bend<00:02:27.969> and

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
back zip so you can stretch and Bend and

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.030 
back zip so you can stretch and Bend and
do<00:02:28.810> things<00:02:29.019> a<00:02:29.079> little<00:02:29.170> bit<00:02:29.319> more<00:02:29.469> naturally

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
do things a little bit more naturally

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.949 
do things a little bit more naturally
now<00:02:30.549> not<00:02:30.760> everybody<00:02:31.060> likes<00:02:31.389> a<00:02:31.599> chest<00:02:31.870> zip

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
now not everybody likes a chest zip

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:33.629 
now not everybody likes a chest zip
entry<00:02:32.560> wetsuit<00:02:32.950> it's<00:02:33.069> really<00:02:33.310> a<00:02:33.340> matter<00:02:33.519> of

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:33.639 
entry wetsuit it's really a matter of

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.360 
entry wetsuit it's really a matter of
preference<00:02:34.709> whether<00:02:35.709> you<00:02:35.859> want<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.099> go<00:02:36.250> in

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
preference whether you want to go in

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.429 
preference whether you want to go in
through<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:36.639> back<00:02:36.819> or<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.150> front<00:02:37.319> what<00:02:38.319> I<00:02:38.349> do

00:02:38.429 --> 00:02:38.439 
through the back or the front what I do

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.979 
through the back or the front what I do
want<00:02:38.620> to<00:02:38.709> say<00:02:38.769> is<00:02:39.069> that<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.310> synchro<00:02:39.989> series

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
want to say is that the synchro series

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.289 
want to say is that the synchro series
wetsuit<00:02:41.500> that's<00:02:42.340> gluten<00:02:42.670> blind<00:02:42.849> stitch<00:02:43.090> is

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
wetsuit that's gluten blind stitch is

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:45.629 
wetsuit that's gluten blind stitch is
identical<00:02:43.900> in<00:02:44.109> construction<00:02:45.040> so<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> chest

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:45.639 
identical in construction so the chest

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:47.429 
identical in construction so the chest
zip<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.090> back<00:02:46.269> step<00:02:46.569> are<00:02:46.780> identical<00:02:47.349> and

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:47.439 
zip and the back step are identical and

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:49.199 
zip and the back step are identical and
materials<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.099> construction<00:02:48.459> the<00:02:49.000> only

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
materials and construction the only

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.360 
materials and construction the only
difference<00:02:49.389> is<00:02:49.689> that<00:02:49.989> one<00:02:50.620> interested<00:02:51.310> the

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
difference is that one interested the

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.610 
difference is that one interested the
back<00:02:51.579> and<00:02:51.849> this<00:02:52.000> particular<00:02:52.150> one<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.930> enter

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
back and this particular one you enter

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.509 
back and this particular one you enter
into<00:02:53.919> the<00:02:54.370> front<00:02:55.290> let's<00:02:56.290> take<00:02:56.470> a<00:02:56.500> look<00:02:56.739> at<00:02:56.829> the

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
into the front let's take a look at the

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.039 
into the front let's take a look at the
construction<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.209> suit<00:02:58.389> as<00:02:58.540> I<00:02:58.689> mentioned

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
construction of the suit as I mentioned

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:01.289 
construction of the suit as I mentioned
before<00:02:59.079> it's<00:02:59.439> a<00:02:59.560> sealed<00:02:59.829> seen<00:03:00.129> wetsuit<00:03:00.609> in<00:03:00.849> the

00:03:01.289 --> 00:03:01.299 
before it's a sealed seen wetsuit in the

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:03.330 
before it's a sealed seen wetsuit in the
manufacturing<00:03:01.989> process<00:03:02.079> the<00:03:02.680> neoprene<00:03:03.129> was

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
manufacturing process the neoprene was

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.429 
manufacturing process the neoprene was
first<00:03:03.609> glued<00:03:03.939> together<00:03:04.120> and<00:03:04.569> then<00:03:05.049> a<00:03:05.079> blind

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
first glued together and then a blind

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.440 
first glued together and then a blind
stitch<00:03:05.739> was<00:03:05.980> put<00:03:06.280> along<00:03:06.700> all<00:03:06.909> the<00:03:06.969> scenes<00:03:07.359> of

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
stitch was put along all the scenes of

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.390 
stitch was put along all the scenes of
the<00:03:07.569> wetsuit<00:03:08.019> and<00:03:08.260> what<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.709> means<00:03:09.129> is<00:03:09.340> a

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
the wetsuit and what that means is a

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.220 
the wetsuit and what that means is a
blind<00:03:09.639> stitch<00:03:09.939> doesn't<00:03:10.269> penetrate<00:03:10.540> through

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
blind stitch doesn't penetrate through

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.140 
blind stitch doesn't penetrate through
both<00:03:11.500> pieces<00:03:11.769> in<00:03:11.980> ear<00:03:12.099> praying<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:12.819> only<00:03:12.939> goes

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
both pieces in ear praying it only goes

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.509 
both pieces in ear praying it only goes
halfway<00:03:13.450> through<00:03:13.989> and<00:03:14.200> that<00:03:14.650> allows<00:03:15.069> for<00:03:15.489> a

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
halfway through and that allows for a

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.819 
halfway through and that allows for a
watertight<00:03:16.269> seem<00:03:16.689> so<00:03:17.229> if<00:03:17.319> we<00:03:17.409> look<00:03:17.440> on<00:03:17.709> the

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:17.829 
watertight seem so if we look on the

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.219 
watertight seem so if we look on the
inside<00:03:18.010> of<00:03:18.280> this<00:03:18.489> wetsuit<00:03:18.970> we<00:03:19.629> can<00:03:19.840> notice

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:20.229 
inside of this wetsuit we can notice

00:03:20.229 --> 00:03:22.170 
inside of this wetsuit we can notice
that<00:03:20.500> we<00:03:21.069> don't<00:03:21.190> see<00:03:21.430> stitching<00:03:21.849> because<00:03:22.090> the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
that we don't see stitching because the

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.580 
that we don't see stitching because the
stitching<00:03:22.510> doesn't<00:03:22.780> go<00:03:22.870> all<00:03:22.989> the<00:03:23.109> way<00:03:23.139> through

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
stitching doesn't go all the way through
