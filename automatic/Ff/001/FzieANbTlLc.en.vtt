00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:18.180
 hello friends here coke scouts 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:23.020
 transmitting today I come with another promise 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:26.800
 I feel the delay the daily duty I 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:30.910
 it prevents recording the videos and making them and 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.860
 all with the speed and expressions 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.980
 I would have but good 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.160
 get used today I'll talk about 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.550
 mattia pÃ©rin 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:45.770
 Mattia Perin is an Italian goalkeeper one 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:48.770
 of those who have the most future 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.250
 and was born in latina italia on 10 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.890
 November 1992 that is 20 years old has 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.680
 just play goalie like I said 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.950
 in the fishery although it is owned by 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.489
 genoa left his quarry and followed in 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.489
 the club 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.060
 where did he come from last year 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.920
 example 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.920
 webber of the size of read frame and 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:21.180
 lorenzo insigne or even immobile 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:24.660
 all of them the immobile ones of 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.979
 ratti was from the quarry but at three 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:33.030
 they were a result to a superior team and 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.310
 is who is having the nickname 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.150
 of the team discoverer team 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.150
 talents in Italian football 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.670
 and talking about this kid of 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.250
 only 20 years old I remember 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.940
 is a goalkeeper who is quite agile under 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.300
 under sticks 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.510
 and usually put up pretty good one 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.670
 against one goes well holds it well is 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.760
 the typical sport two Argentines are going 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:05.420
 being Italian but it's a jail 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.830
 psychic type quite typical of the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:09.950
 Argentine courts endure very well in 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.590
 the cold is very brave in the outputs 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.470
 well of dreams and such 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.970
 and very determined but you would have to improve 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.970
 a little because sometimes leaves 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.670
 more for going too unequal is 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.920
 too untimely and sang one that 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.160
 again although it measures one meter eighty and 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.920
 eight you have a considerable height for 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:36.019
 which is in inexperience and youth 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:38.040
 that I suppose that they will make it better and 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.650
 cover it for 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.230
 be an egg of the outputs that usually 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.510
 fail not too many goalkeepers and 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.120
 from the departures should leave a 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.730
 little footwork in the processes of 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.599
 walking are characterized by being good 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:58.290
 players because they do not usually play very 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:01.079
 well with the feet and this kid 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.459
 neither is a section above apart it is 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:08.069
 young in sum everything and I'm not a 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.989
 essential thing that should improve a 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.489
 doorman yes or yes but it never hurts 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.770
 that a goalkeeper that looks like to see 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.870
 the feet 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:17.120
 and there's not much more to talk about 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.370
 of this young man because he just went out to 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.710
 do the keys of little played with the 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:24.500
 sub-21 of italy then that the 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:28.100
 interiors and is even at the doors 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:31.630
 is the one called by the absolute is all 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:33.600
 they say it 's the generational relay of 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:37.680
 newport 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:42.630
 and we'll see how it is for that and 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.910
 to see if he makes the jump to some team of 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:48.160
 of the Italian league of more name is 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.710
 he talked about juventus as his own 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.300
 the replacement of the buffoon or impulse of 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.150
 milan who has had guide is my 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:01.519
 older so good we'll see 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:04.110
 and I hope to follow more promises with less 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:08.900
 wait time I wait 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.900
 and nothing this is all come on then
