00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
all right here we go the tuning of the

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.980 
all right here we go the tuning of the
system<00:00:04.609> I've<00:00:05.609> been<00:00:05.790> working<00:00:06.180> on<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:06.509> now<00:00:06.720> for

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
system I've been working on this now for

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.629 
system I've been working on this now for
a<00:00:07.020> couple<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.350> months<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.859> it's<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.160> ton<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.519> fun

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
a couple of months and it's a ton of fun

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.259 
a couple of months and it's a ton of fun
and<00:00:09.830> coming<00:00:10.830> up<00:00:10.920> with<00:00:11.040> new<00:00:11.160> ideas<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.910> ways<00:00:12.030> to

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
and coming up with new ideas and ways to

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.600 
and coming up with new ideas and ways to
make<00:00:12.420> things<00:00:12.599> work<00:00:13.130> right<00:00:14.130> now<00:00:14.340> I<00:00:14.370> want<00:00:14.549> to

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
make things work right now I want to

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.290 
make things work right now I want to
give<00:00:14.759> you<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.750> dimensions<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.379> my<00:00:16.529> system

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
give you the dimensions of my system

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.269 
give you the dimensions of my system
that<00:00:18.300> way<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.570> can<00:00:19.020> take<00:00:19.439> these<00:00:19.619> numbers<00:00:20.100> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
that way you can take these numbers and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.099 
that way you can take these numbers and
sort<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.580> calculate<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.930> whatever

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
sort of calculate it to you to whatever

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.080 
sort of calculate it to you to whatever
you're<00:00:22.439> doing<00:00:22.830> you<00:00:23.100> know<00:00:23.189> either<00:00:23.340> reducing<00:00:23.970> it

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
you're doing you know either reducing it

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.480 
you're doing you know either reducing it
or<00:00:24.269> or<00:00:24.689> expanding<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.710> give<00:00:25.980> you<00:00:26.099> a<00:00:26.130> basic

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
or or expanding it to give you a basic

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.700 
or or expanding it to give you a basic
idea<00:00:26.609> of<00:00:27.380> what's<00:00:28.380> what<00:00:28.769> will<00:00:28.980> work<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.189> you

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
idea of what's what will work for you

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.280 
idea of what's what will work for you
gravel<00:00:31.710> volume<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:33.680> the<00:00:34.680> water<00:00:35.399> volume<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
gravel volume and the water volume and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.869 
gravel volume and the water volume and
this<00:00:37.290> is<00:00:37.469> actually<00:00:37.890> how<00:00:38.010> much<00:00:38.129> water<00:00:38.430> ends<00:00:38.700> up

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
this is actually how much water ends up

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.780 
this is actually how much water ends up
into<00:00:39.300> your<00:00:39.480> plant<00:00:39.750> box<00:00:40.020> which<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.190> a<00:00:41.370> lot<00:00:41.610> less

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
into your plant box which is a lot less

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.229 
into your plant box which is a lot less
than<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:42.030> would<00:00:42.210> would<00:00:42.690> you<00:00:42.840> would<00:00:42.960> think

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:44.239 
than you would would you would think

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:49.700 
than you would would you would think
also<00:00:45.239> here<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.899> the<00:00:47.510> in<00:00:48.510> my<00:00:48.719> aquaponic<00:00:49.320> system

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
also here is the in my aquaponic system

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.950 
also here is the in my aquaponic system
I'm<00:00:49.860> using<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.399> bell<00:00:50.579> siphon<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.300> control<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
I'm using a bell siphon to control the

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.569 
I'm using a bell siphon to control the
the<00:00:51.989> water<00:00:52.890> in<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> system<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:55.280> this<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.340> the

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
the water in the system and this is the

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.240 
the water in the system and this is the
Bell<00:00:56.969> part<00:00:57.329> of<00:00:57.449> the<00:00:57.510> siphon<00:00:57.930> this<00:00:58.350> is<00:00:58.590> how<00:00:59.190> you

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
Bell part of the siphon this is how you

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.660 
Bell part of the siphon this is how you
determine<00:00:59.489> how<00:00:59.879> much<00:01:00.030> water<00:01:00.449> exits<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
determine how much water exits the the

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.760 
determine how much water exits the the
plant<00:01:03.629> bed<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:05.450> this<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.840> siphon<00:01:07.530> tube

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
plant bed and this is the siphon tube

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.320 
plant bed and this is the siphon tube
and<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.430> how<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:08.640> control<00:01:08.880> how<00:01:09.180> much

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and this is how you control how much

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.990 
and this is how you control how much
water<00:01:09.390> enters<00:01:10.200> and<00:01:10.439> actually<00:01:11.369> fills<00:01:11.610> up<00:01:11.820> your

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
water enters and actually fills up your

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.510 
water enters and actually fills up your
plant<00:01:12.210> bed<00:01:12.450> you<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.770> want<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.040> water<00:01:14.220> in<00:01:14.430> the

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
plant bed you you want the water in the

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.300 
plant bed you you want the water in the
system<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.180> fill<00:01:15.450> just<00:01:15.960> below<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.500> top<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:17.070> the

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
system to fill just below the top of the

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.969 
system to fill just below the top of the
gravel<00:01:17.610> so<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.630> want<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:18.900> to<00:01:19.049> be<00:01:19.650> about<00:01:19.830> an

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
gravel so you want it to be about an

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.160 
gravel so you want it to be about an
inch<00:01:20.100> to<00:01:20.369> two<00:01:20.400> inches<00:01:20.850> below<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.330> surface<00:01:21.780> of

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
inch to two inches below the surface of

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.580 
inch to two inches below the surface of
the<00:01:22.259> gravel<00:01:22.710> that's<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.549> ideal<00:01:24.140> height<00:01:25.140> for

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
the gravel that's the ideal height for

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.109 
the gravel that's the ideal height for
the<00:01:25.680> water<00:01:26.250> to<00:01:26.430> fill<00:01:27.409> also<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.560> this<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.700> way<00:01:30.090> I

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
the water to fill also in this the way I

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.450 
the water to fill also in this the way I
control<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.810> water<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.409> each<00:01:31.590> plant<00:01:31.950> bed<00:01:32.189> is

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
control the water to each plant bed is

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.069 
control the water to each plant bed is
by<00:01:33.119> using<00:01:33.360> these<00:01:33.659> two<00:01:33.900> valves<00:01:34.740> one<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.640> the

so you may need a larger stand Pipers or

so you may need a larger stand Pipers or
the<00:02:37.410> siphon<00:02:37.799> will<00:02:37.950> not<00:02:38.069> break<00:02:38.370> when<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.640> bed

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
plant beds you'll probably have to use a

smaller diameter stand pipe I used one

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:43.029 
smaller diameter stand pipe I used one
inch<00:05:40.550> pipe<00:05:40.819> that<00:05:41.180> exits<00:05:41.930> my<00:05:42.110> plant<00:05:42.469> beds<00:05:42.709> and

inch pipe that exits my plant beds and

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:45.309 
inch pipe that exits my plant beds and
that<00:05:43.430> allows<00:05:43.699> me<00:05:43.939> to<00:05:43.969> use<00:05:44.120> the<00:05:44.599> one<00:05:44.930> inch<00:05:45.110> pipe

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 
that allows me to use the one inch pipe

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:46.809 
that allows me to use the one inch pipe
for<00:05:45.589> the<00:05:45.620> stand<00:05:45.919> pipe<00:05:46.069> which<00:05:46.339> is<00:05:46.490> a<00:05:46.519> large

for the stand pipe which is a large
diameter<00:05:47.509> stand<00:05:48.319> pipe<00:05:48.499> or<00:05:48.800> I<00:05:49.129> can<00:05:49.490> reduce<00:05:49.789> it

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:49.969 
diameter stand pipe or I can reduce it

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:52.299

for two plant beds

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:29.690 
for two plant beds
or<00:06:27.750> use<00:06:28.350> some<00:06:28.680> of<00:06:28.800> the<00:06:28.890> pressure<00:06:29.160> to<00:06:29.310> spray
