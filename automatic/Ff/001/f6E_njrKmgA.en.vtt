00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
to get as you can see i'm not quick

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.550 
to get as you can see i'm not quick
enough<00:01:20.400> for<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.790> with<00:01:21.360> this<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:22.140> if<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.409> are

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560

enough for a with this but if you are
quick<00:01:22.770> enough<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.280> make<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.460> ton<00:01:23.700> of<00:01:23.759> comes

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
quick enough you can make a ton of comes

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.719 
quick enough you can make a ton of comes
from<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.360> guy's<00:01:24.710> and<00:01:25.710> if<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.490> it

from this guy's and if you do this it
for<00:01:26.970> say<00:01:27.090> 30<00:01:27.360> minutes<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:28.439> can<00:01:28.619> probably<00:01:28.890> make

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
for say 30 minutes you can probably make

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.280 
for say 30 minutes you can probably make
yourself<00:01:29.520> at<00:01:29.640> sonic<00:01:29.939> coins<00:01:30.150> and<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.140> also

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
yourself at sonic coins and you can also

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.710 
yourself at sonic coins and you can also
do<00:01:31.530> this<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:31.860> like<00:01:32.100> let's<00:01:33.000> see<00:01:33.150> we<00:01:33.270> pick<00:01:33.450> one<00:01:33.600> up

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
right there guys we probably won't be

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.679 
right there guys we probably won't be
able<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:35.340> get<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.520> one<00:01:35.700> no<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.000> done<00:01:36.180> but<00:01:36.630> this

Crowley<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.470> let's<00:01:37.619> check<00:01:37.860> what<00:01:38.040> his<00:01:38.280> cheap<00:01:38.520> is

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
Crowley so let's check what his cheap is

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.030 
Crowley so let's check what his cheap is
in<00:01:39.299> fact<00:01:39.479> we're<00:01:39.630> just<00:01:39.750> going<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:39.900> list<00:01:40.110> it<00:01:40.290> at

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
in fact we're just going to list it at

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.080 
in fact we're just going to list it at
about<00:01:42.560> 1300<00:01:43.560> coins<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.280> I<00:01:44.310> know<00:01:44.490> it's<00:01:44.759> not<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
about 1300 coins so I know it's not the

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.600 
about 1300 coins so I know it's not the
greatest<00:01:45.390> profit<00:01:46.079> but<00:01:46.710> it's<00:01:46.890> still<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.430> the

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
greatest profit but it's still it's the

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.280 
greatest profit but it's still it's the
budget<00:01:48.030> profit<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.570> this<00:01:48.659> method<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.140> can

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
budget profit and this method you can

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.749 
budget profit and this method you can
make<00:01:49.470> tons<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:49.829> coins<00:01:49.890> over<00:01:50.250> time<00:01:50.430> you're

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
make tons of coins over time you're

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.880

doing<00:01:50.939> this<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.329> dear<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.290> really<00:01:52.740> make

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
doing this all dear you can really make

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.740 
doing this all dear you can really make
yourself<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.579> really<00:01:53.820> rack<00:01:54.119> up<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.479> lot<00:01:54.509> of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
yourself and really rack up a lot of

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.120 
yourself and really rack up a lot of
kind<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.470> let's<00:01:55.619> see<00:01:55.770> what<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.100> find

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
kind so let's see what you can find

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.160 
kind so let's see what you can find
again<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:56.759> there's<00:01:57.240> tons<00:01:57.450> gain<00:01:57.719> let's<00:01:57.960> do<00:01:58.049> it

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
again so there's tons gain let's do it

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
get the concept to this let's have a

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.140 
get the concept to this let's have a
look<00:02:11.849> actually<00:02:12.030> now<00:02:12.420> at<00:02:12.690> the

it's going to have a look at this
northern<00:02:21.579> island<00:02:21.849> there<00:02:21.970> we<00:02:22.030> go<00:02:22.150> let's<00:02:22.689> see

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
northern island there we go let's see

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.390 
northern island there we go let's see

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:24.400 
what the cheapest RDC you can see these

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.460 
what the cheapest RDC you can see these
ones<00:02:24.670> don't<00:02:24.760> seem<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.269> go<00:02:25.390> for<00:02:25.569> as<00:02:25.629> much<00:02:25.840> so<00:02:26.379> you

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
ones don't seem to go for as much so you

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.530 
ones don't seem to go for as much so you
can't<00:02:26.739> really<00:02:26.860> do<00:02:27.280> it<00:02:27.310> too<00:02:27.579> much<00:02:27.790> on<00:02:28.000> these<00:02:28.150> so

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
can't really do it too much on these so

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.819 
can't really do it too much on these so

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:40.359 
have a look right now so we'll check the

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:41.880 
have a look right now so we'll check the
cheapest<00:02:40.659> it<00:02:40.780> should<00:02:40.959> be<00:02:41.049> around<00:02:41.140> probably

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
cheapest it should be around probably

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.160 
cheapest it should be around probably
2,000<00:02:42.670> maybe<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.650> yet<00:02:44.790> 1900<00:02:45.790> 1800<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:46.900> let's

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
2,000 maybe and yet 1900 1800 so let's

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.580
