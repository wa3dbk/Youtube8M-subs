00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.610
 what 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:09.680
 we are nothing more and nothing less than 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.960
 Jean Paul and he is the conductor of 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.850
 entertainment and also is a user of 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.280
 samsung and just will show us 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.780
 the products that the jean brand brings today 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.119
 Paul, how are you doing very well, thank you very much 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.429
 I am very happy because samsung judges 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.869
 that approached the channel a while ago and 

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.820
 has had a very good relationship of 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.509
 made our new set is riddled with 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.740
 samsung screens and they asked me to 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.870
 If I wanted to know a little more about 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.670
 make me more involved and I fascinated 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.770
 because when I got to Mexico and I started 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.690
 ride let's say my first defect I got 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.940
 to samsung but as a consumer like 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.740
 someone who compares characteristics 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.830
 compared technology that compares price 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.020
 of course and on my teles and I laughed 

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.490
 example were in samsung and right now that 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.650
 I'm getting to know the new things 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:54.380
 that bring that impression 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.160
 this is the object of the greatest desire 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:00.860
 I think this year is the the active 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.780
 smart easy and what is like a tablet and 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.780
 laptop 2 in one or because here you can 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.610
 take off this inter was remarkable that 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.370
 is screen of course 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.200
 with windows 8 that is super intuitive and 

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:13.610
 that I think speaks a lot like what 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.100
 the point where we are in the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.740
 technology because I feel that levels 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.290
 the terrain for the users or this is 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.460
 it is a system to which all 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.260
 smartphone users we are 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.660
 accustomed that is true not to be used 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:28.910
 applications and always ask me 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.900
 why like traditional technology 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.860
 I had not taken that leap because 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.270
 I suppose that many of you 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.310
 Well, they have not used as programs 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.390
 to edit video to avoid music or 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.430
 something like that 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.250
 the old software then let 's say it 's 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.710
 much heavier is difficult to use but 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:47.420
 everything is done application 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.869
 I personally make music and I 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.729
 it surprises me a lot this application I just 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.410
 to discover five minutes ago is so 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.650
 intuitive that I'm already making music 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.330
 with the 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.650
 I usually work with the echo of 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.960
 propeller rock garage rather in other 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.130
 platforms but look open and you can 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.450
 select any style we are going to 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.220
 do a chaos then here as for 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.660
 light the atmosphere there but for 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.450
 example you want I was traveling a lot 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.410
 that you have to go to events cover this 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.180
 type of events 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.400
 when you travel you prefer a smartphone 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:19.260
 you prefer to bring a tablet and a 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.210
 I think that I believe that the 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.490
 smartphone opened the panorama us 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.940
 they taught how we could use the 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.400
 technology in another way but it's true 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.930
 because it is very small or not I do not 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.970
 I feel comfortable making music in something 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.340
 so so small because the fingers are 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.320
 awkward east of kansas very easy to the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.790
 view it seems to me that this size was 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.770
 perfect and it catches my attention 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.080
 because it's like I can think of a thousand 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.480
 possibilities for this 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:48.270
 my cousins ​​who are in my school in a 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.680
 speaker let's say in your house to your compass and 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.290
 your laptop to work and do your 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.060
 tasks but when they go to school they 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.180
 they are going to play with friends as they take off 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:59.010
 and they take their their pair nothing else I think 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.660
 super cool I find it super practical 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.250
 above all and what most calls me the 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.080
 attention is that they are things that one and water 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.080
 that's what's coming and that 's it 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.440
 this is awesome, this has 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.900
 windows 8 let's say apart from the 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.490
 computer that as I tell you is a 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.110
 interface is super simple especially if 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:21.350
 you have the opportunity to have something with 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:25.740
 touch screen like this to tips martín si 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.850
 You can get a lot of juice but it 's like 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.760
 a little boy with this blessed 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:32.070
 program that takes you on 8 channels of 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.930
 different instruments each one has 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:35.430
 as different preset groups 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.320
 but they all combine with each other then 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.060
 can you change let's say I want the 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.130
 guitar forgiveness the bass in this case 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.230
 is making a saint james figure 

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.120
 but then later change us I use it as 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:46.800
 says here right now is still 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.350
 running in the song outline 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.120
 it's as if you did mixing by creating in 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.410
 I live in I imagine you throw everything 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.970
 using this but good 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:55.320
 directly say not how many years ago 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.480
 you have I think that in that more or less 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.250
 as of my age but no more when 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.380
 except I grew up with computers 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.209
 pc is then a pc then I grama and 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.230
 good what is pc forever 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:06.690
 We are like using various platforms 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:08.480
 the question a bit is now that windows 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.730
 8 renewed all its design 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.830
 how was the beginning because it is beautiful 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.540
 is very friendly has many things to 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.160
 the beginning uses something new always 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.540
 It costs work in your experience as 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.639
 was that is the most telling is that in two 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.669
 minutes of standing in front of him what do you use 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.400
 and you handle it like anything I think 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.100
 that windows is an undeniable return 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:34.160
 Bone point came back stomping and yes 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.780
 I think it 's a great bet and I think that 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.500
 is very successful because the consumer already 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.900
 is used to using apps and not only 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.280
 accustomed to doing it because by being 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.740
 consumer and by using smartphones 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.300
 but because because we saw it as something 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.039
 very simple, there is nothing easier 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.830
 to have everything in the cloud I tried nothing 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:54.650
 it is super simple and like that we 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.570
 facilitate that on a day-to- day basis and that 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.250
 computers vibrates I feel that the others 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.840
 computers where you have to give double 

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:02.000
 click and wait for it to open that everything loads 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.220
 it's like old is a dinosaur this is 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.389
 this is required for Christmas and I want 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.320
 another for my birthday 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:11.150
 is going to be elected is it was jean paul 

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.720
 and thank you very much for your time for you 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.720
 many thanks
