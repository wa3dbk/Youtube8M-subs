00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:11.280
 yes and there we are back again 

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:13.889
 Display this in springfield and look 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.640
 Look at what 's on our minds today 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:21.510
 program is here at our little 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.500
 town yes as you can see today 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.480
 of course with your tasks 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.170
 by of course it's always sometime 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.730
 of course that repeats everything pretty much 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:38.579
 but well that is more or less 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:41.610
 less synonymous the options or 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.960
 the strategy of the game you stop 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.390
 a lot of things keeps on doing 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.890
 namely collect the money and task 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.829
 So that is already repeated 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.399
 relatively much or even in the actions 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:56.280
 here like making a knot or something 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:01:00.539
 of course always the thing that you 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.289
 many things just like today 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.289
 everyone faked 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.780
 probably the game actually 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.840
 not designed for it 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.840
 become 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:20.100
 and that does not mean it ever happens 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:24.659
 so much exciting that you from 1000 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.580
 could build different sequence could read 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:31.259
 because I, we look again at what 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:34.439
 Rubbellos wins one more here 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:37.490
 task let martin loud play yet 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.490
 once faster did not last long 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.399
 enjoy the weather a bit again 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.490
 better then slowly then the conversion of 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.570
 colleges seen through from the aspect 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.740
 was actually the rain country like that 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.680
 I did not want to go wrong 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.630
 complain now that is actually from 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:05.520
 weather got a bit better 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.170
 we see is mayor 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.340
 Of course now for a few 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.480
 follow and also has a task for us 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.340
 That's why I would say look and yourself 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.379
 just now 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.290
 I would like to build something again 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.970
 so that's not another one 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:24.879
 inconsiderable considerable sum applies 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.640
 here with us on the account down here 

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:33.670
 the 65,000 no I did not want to 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:35.349
 shop and that is why is bad on the 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:41.860
 side has a screen as is and 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:43.920
 can be killed as I said 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.040
 I would like to build something 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:49.329
 but that is not possible at the moment and we are 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.970
 we can have that much money 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:53.470
 but maybe watch another 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:03:01.989
 cheap land will get up here 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:03:12.250
 for 9000 14,000 14,000 19,000 19 it still 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:13.780
 9000 9000 9000 9000 9000 9000 times 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.459
 Nine seems like the going price to 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:24.040
 his meanwhile finally becomes this 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:25.389
 tend what are we going to do here 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:31.870
 the two of them have the city 

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:34.590
 pull the length or here after 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:41.790
 down a bit at the stadium 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:44.620
 the two buy yes say something 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.310
 let that stay up with 14 that 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.799
 that's a bit much i find 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.220
 i am in these houses settlement car 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.599
 we believe we are down you are 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:03.340
 a little more direction 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:06.180
 then just take that and then 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.669
 we still have a little bit here 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:12.010
 Travel still under construction could be shorter 

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:13.299
 not always here a bit ins 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:19.919
 make water away and here are still houses 

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:22.090
 towards building still so for us 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:26.660
 belongs accustomed them we can 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:33.509
 move back to the nuclear power plant 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:35.539
 rest yes, yes, too 

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:40.620
 What 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:41.759
 have space for a bit what should 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.050
 I have already gone there again 

00:04:41.759 --> 00:04:45.979
 above in front of the area are now 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.810
 Let's look at four parts 

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.850
 That's why we have to go up there for a moment 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.130
 arrange somewhere 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.310
 As a dÃ©co I can do that too 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:00.090
 let it go 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:03.780
 Of course we got tight because we have to 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:06.240
 create a little space then fits 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.740
 the last suddenly weird porno 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.880
 in between and we have two again 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.150
 beautiful new fields we still 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:18.900
 somehow full of some nasty 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.530
 However, that can be done now 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.570
 of course, again a bit 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:26.400
 I would like to look different 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:34.639
 a little something different now 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:37.639
 just do the tons here 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.639
 and 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:58.270
 1 closer to that not no no that 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:06:07.680
 not like that and then no, too 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:10.600
 Do not break off as you walk from the walkway 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:13.750
 and just build it here and there 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:17.230
 so that we almost come back here 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:23.610
 have space and then we do 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:23.610
 not even the tree on page 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:28.950
 the river away and then in here 

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:37.330
 oh that was a little too namely 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:39.750
 no no that is not here to 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.750
 I wanted to have 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:07:10.210
 and then there's the cannon too 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:07:11.830
 is still a little bit of people so now 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:14.230
 If we have the road then we can still 

00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:17.669
 theoretically here is some building 

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.810
 clap on this small area 

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:22.150
 how will we get two more 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.550
 things or depending on what we have 

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:26.440
 Something bigger is still somehow something 

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:30.340
 Maybe you can come up with that 

00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:32.610
 also the whole thing here a bit 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:36.030
 can make space-saving always 

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:36.030
 push there
