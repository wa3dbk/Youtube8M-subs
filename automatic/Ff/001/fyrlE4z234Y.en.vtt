over from one side of the map to the

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:04.270 
over from one side of the map to the
other<00:01:02.960> my<00:01:03.350> tips<00:01:03.559> for<00:01:03.679> discovery<00:01:04.040> is<00:01:04.129> really

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
other my tips for discovery is really

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.350 
other my tips for discovery is really
just<00:01:04.400> learning<00:01:04.699> the<00:01:04.790> layout<00:01:05.000> of<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.180> map

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
just learning the layout of the map

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.180 
just learning the layout of the map
understanding<00:01:06.080> how<00:01:06.110> that<00:01:06.350> chasm<00:01:06.740> can<00:01:06.920> impact

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.190 
understanding how that chasm can impact

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.100 
understanding how that chasm can impact
the<00:01:07.610> flow<00:01:07.790> of<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.970> game<00:01:08.000> play<00:01:08.390> and<00:01:08.630> always
