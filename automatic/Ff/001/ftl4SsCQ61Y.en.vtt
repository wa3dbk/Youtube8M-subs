a little bit heavier of a roll and it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.319 
a little bit heavier of a roll and it
gives<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.130> lace<00:01:29.610> area<00:01:29.970> where<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.150> leather

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
gives this lace area where the leather

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:31.850 
gives this lace area where the leather
is<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:30.509> different<00:01:30.930> look<00:01:31.079> different<00:01:31.259> dimension

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
is a different look different dimension

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.069 
is a different look different dimension
I<00:01:32.150> noticed<00:01:33.150> I<00:01:33.210> have<00:01:33.360> other<00:01:33.540> premiums<00:01:33.869> here<00:01:34.020> in

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
I noticed I have other premiums here in

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.870 
I noticed I have other premiums here in
the<00:01:34.140> store<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.590> they<00:01:35.189> don't<00:01:35.369> seem<00:01:35.579> to<00:01:35.670> be<00:01:35.790> as

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
the store and they don't seem to be as

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.760 
the store and they don't seem to be as
quite<00:01:36.119> as<00:01:36.240> heavy<00:01:36.479> as<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.650> think

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
quite as heavy as this one so I think

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.170 
quite as heavy as this one so I think
maybe<00:01:38.130> was<00:01:38.250> done<00:01:38.400> on<00:01:38.490> purpose<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.909> gives<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.119> a

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
maybe was done on purpose it gives it a

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.429 
maybe was done on purpose it gives it a
little<00:01:39.270> bit<00:01:39.450> nicer<00:01:39.780> look<00:01:40.079> different

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
little bit nicer look different

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.920 
little bit nicer look different

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:43.859 
gets real deep so I thought that was a

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:45.440 
gets real deep so I thought that was a
pretty<00:03:44.040> cool<00:03:44.220> look<00:03:44.430> I'm<00:03:44.669> giving<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.299> real

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450

deep<00:03:45.660> blue<00:03:46.079> look<00:03:46.349> and<00:03:46.590> if<00:03:46.680> you<00:03:46.799> look<00:03:47.010> I<00:03:47.190> know<00:03:47.250> if

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
deep blue look and if you look I know if

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.400 
deep blue look and if you look I know if
it<00:03:47.430> comes<00:03:47.549> up<00:03:47.700> on<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:47.849> camera<00:03:48.329> put<00:03:48.959> some<00:03:49.200> white

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
it comes up on the camera put some white

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.530 
it comes up on the camera put some white
expectancy<00:03:50.340> whether<00:03:50.549> it<00:03:50.639> be<00:03:50.730> white<00:03:50.940> caps<00:03:51.269> or

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
expectancy whether it be white caps or

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.210 
expectancy whether it be white caps or
just<00:03:51.930> given<00:03:52.139> the<00:03:52.200> ocean<00:03:52.530> different<00:03:52.799> dimension

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
just given the ocean different dimension

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.349 
just given the ocean different dimension
I<00:03:53.310> think<00:03:53.549> that's<00:03:53.669> a<00:03:53.760> pretty<00:03:53.879> cool<00:03:54.150> look<00:03:54.329> to
