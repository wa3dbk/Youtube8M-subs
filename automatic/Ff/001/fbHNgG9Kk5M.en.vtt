the<00:00:43.970> oceans<00:00:44.300> very<00:00:44.540> forgiving<00:00:45.050> there's<00:00:45.620> strong

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
the oceans very forgiving there's strong

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.700 
the oceans very forgiving there's strong
currents<00:00:46.460> big<00:00:47.360> swells<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:48.020> it's<00:00:48.140> very<00:00:48.320> easy<00:00:48.530> to

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
currents big swells so it's very easy to

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.180 
currents big swells so it's very easy to
drown<00:00:49.100> but<00:00:49.430> also<00:00:50.330> for<00:00:51.670> cardio<00:00:52.670> you<00:00:52.760> do<00:00:54.070> have<00:00:55.070> to

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
catch a wave we are going to put our

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.609 
catch a wave we are going to put our
shrimp<00:01:15.770> foot<00:01:16.399> back<00:01:16.580> behind<00:01:16.820> us<00:01:17.240> and<00:01:17.660> our<00:01:18.440> weak

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
shrimp foot back behind us and our weak

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:20.350 
shrimp foot back behind us and our weak
foot<00:01:18.830> in<00:01:18.950> front<00:01:19.130> and<00:01:19.340> push<00:01:19.610> off<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:20.000> bottom

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
foot in front and push off the bottom

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.389 
foot in front and push off the bottom
and<00:01:20.509> take<00:01:21.290> the<00:01:21.440> wave<00:01:21.619> end<00:01:21.890> that's<00:01:22.280> the

00:01:22.389 --> 00:01:22.399 
and take the wave end that's the

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.120 
and take the wave end that's the
fundamental<00:01:22.700> first<00:01:23.330> body<00:01:23.660> surfing<00:01:24.170> the<00:01:24.920> other

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
fundamental first body surfing the other

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.340 
fundamental first body surfing the other
way<00:01:25.369> our<00:01:25.640> technique<00:01:26.060> which<00:01:26.240> I<00:01:26.450> do<00:01:26.509> is<00:01:26.960> I<00:01:26.990> swim

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
way our technique which I do is I swim

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.649 
way our technique which I do is I swim
all<00:01:27.620> the<00:01:27.650> way<00:01:27.740> out<00:01:28.010> and<00:01:28.220> then<00:01:29.180> when<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.510> waves

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
all the way out and then when it waves

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.950 
all the way out and then when it waves
us<00:01:29.870> to<00:01:29.990> curl<00:01:30.290> up<00:01:30.640> in<00:01:31.640> a<00:01:31.729> wave<00:01:31.909> curls<00:01:32.299> up<00:01:32.510> that's

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
us to curl up in a wave curls up that's

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.710 
us to curl up in a wave curls up that's
when<00:01:33.170> I<00:01:33.200> kick<00:01:33.530> stroke<00:01:34.460> basically<00:01:35.270> swim<00:01:35.570> is

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
when I kick stroke basically swim is

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.630 
when I kick stroke basically swim is
harder<00:01:36.049> the<00:01:36.140> best<00:01:36.350> I<00:01:36.530> can<00:01:36.590> to<00:01:36.740> catch<00:01:37.010> the

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
harder the best I can to catch the

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.430 
harder the best I can to catch the
momentum<00:01:38.150> will<00:01:38.390> catch<00:01:38.540> Matt<00:01:38.869> to<00:01:39.049> speed<00:01:39.290> it

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
momentum will catch Matt to speed it

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.740 
momentum will catch Matt to speed it
away<00:01:39.650> when<00:01:39.890> the<00:01:40.010> wave<00:01:40.190> takes<00:01:40.490> you<00:01:40.729> alright<00:01:41.600> now

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:41.750 
away when the wave takes you alright now

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:42.910 
away when the wave takes you alright now
we're<00:01:41.900> going<00:01:41.990> to<00:01:42.080> learn<00:01:42.200> how<00:01:42.470> to<00:01:42.500> basically

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
we're going to learn how to basically

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.910 
we're going to learn how to basically
just<00:01:43.369> push<00:01:43.549> off<00:01:43.729> the<00:01:43.820> bottom<00:01:44.180> and<00:01:44.540> go<00:01:44.900> here<00:01:45.860> we

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
just push off the bottom and go here we

00:01:45.920 --> 00:02:03.960 
just push off the bottom and go here we
go<00:01:45.950> under<00:02:01.659> I'm<00:02:02.659> still<00:02:02.930> being<00:02:03.110> able<00:02:03.290> to<00:02:03.500> stand

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
go under I'm still being able to stand

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.100 
go under I'm still being able to stand
there's<00:02:04.970> a<00:02:05.060> wave<00:02:05.270> right<00:02:05.510> there<00:02:05.540> starting<00:02:06.049> to

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
there's a wave right there starting to

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.160 
there's a wave right there starting to
curl<00:02:06.320> up<00:02:07.119> cars<00:02:08.119> are<00:02:08.330> pull<00:02:08.630> me<00:02:08.750> out

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
curl up cars are pull me out

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.979 
curl up cars are pull me out
and<00:02:09.290> there's<00:02:09.950> two<00:02:10.100> ways<00:02:10.280> you<00:02:10.549> can<00:02:10.700> catch<00:02:10.989> also

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
and there's two ways you can catch also

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.580 
and there's two ways you can catch also
away<00:02:12.260> by<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:12.980> white<00:02:13.310> border<00:02:13.700> which<00:02:14.090> is<00:02:14.120> that

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
away by the white border which is that

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.980 
away by the white border which is that
or<00:02:15.590> you<00:02:15.830> wait<00:02:16.010> for<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.280> wave<00:02:16.400> itself

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
or you wait for the wave itself
