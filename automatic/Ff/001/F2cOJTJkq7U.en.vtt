00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
up in the spirals just let it down right

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.410 
up in the spirals just let it down right

this<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.299> actually<00:02:00.780> instant<00:02:01.170> heating<00:02:01.469> when

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
this is actually instant heating when

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.870 
this is actually instant heating when
you<00:02:02.369> turn<00:02:02.880> it<00:02:02.909> on<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.360> guess<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.840> it's<00:02:04.649> not<00:02:05.250> it's

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
you turn it on I guess and it's not it's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.449 
you turn it on I guess and it's not it's
just<00:02:05.969> not<00:02:06.240> instant<00:02:06.689> heating<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.250> they<00:02:08.250> say

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
just not instant heating it they say

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.460 
just not instant heating it they say
it's<00:02:08.610> instant<00:02:08.940> hanging<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.450> 30<00:02:09.780> seconds<00:02:10.259> but

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
it's instant hanging in 30 seconds but

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.309 
it's instant hanging in 30 seconds but
this<00:02:10.890> took<00:02:11.160> like<00:02:11.459> I'm

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
this took like I'm

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:19.360 
this took like I'm
like<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:14.709> would<00:02:15.709> say<00:02:16.120> two<00:02:17.120> minutes<00:02:18.159> to<00:02:19.159> heat<00:02:19.310> up

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
like I would say two minutes to heat up

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.489 
like I would say two minutes to heat up
all<00:02:19.609> the<00:02:19.730> way<00:02:19.819> but<00:02:20.450> maybe<00:02:20.659> because<00:02:21.109> I<00:02:21.139> have<00:02:21.379> it

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:21.499 
all the way but maybe because I have it

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:22.959 
all the way but maybe because I have it
to<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.709> highest<00:02:21.859> heat<00:02:22.219> setting<00:02:22.579> and<00:02:22.730> it<00:02:22.790> took

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 
to the highest heat setting and it took

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:25.809 
to the highest heat setting and it took
longer<00:02:22.999> if<00:02:23.510> you<00:02:23.959> just<00:02:24.319> have<00:02:24.499> it<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:24.889> number<00:02:25.370> one

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819 
longer if you just have it to number one

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.280 
longer if you just have it to number one
or<00:02:25.969> something<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:26.719> you<00:02:26.840> don't<00:02:27.049> have<00:02:27.139> the

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
or something and you don't have the

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.530 
or something and you don't have the
turbo<00:02:27.590> maybe<00:02:27.859> then<00:02:28.129> it's<00:02:28.310> 30<00:02:28.549> seconds<00:02:29.060> but<00:02:29.269> I

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
turbo maybe then it's 30 seconds but I

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.390 
turbo maybe then it's 30 seconds but I
have<00:02:30.109> it<00:02:30.260> up<00:02:30.349> to<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.620> highest<00:02:30.769> heat<00:02:31.099> setting

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
have it up to the highest heat setting

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.479 
have it up to the highest heat setting
with<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:31.670> turbo<00:02:32.139> so<00:02:33.139> um<00:02:33.680> I<00:02:34.010> don't<00:02:34.129> have<00:02:34.370> to

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
with the turbo so um I don't have to

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.539 
with the turbo so um I don't have to

which i think is

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.810 
which i think is
good<00:04:26.750> because<00:04:27.080> like<00:04:27.530> I<00:04:27.740> just<00:04:28.160> hate<00:04:28.580> when<00:04:28.700> I

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
good because like I just hate when I

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:30.400 
good because like I just hate when I
have<00:04:28.850> to<00:04:29.060> guess<00:04:29.270> okay<00:04:29.600> is<00:04:29.660> it<00:04:29.810> heated<00:04:29.960> up<00:04:30.170> yet

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
have to guess okay is it heated up yet

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.020 
have to guess okay is it heated up yet
because<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.740> don't<00:04:30.920> know<00:04:31.070> maybe<00:04:31.520> it's<00:04:31.670> just<00:04:31.820> not

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.030 
because I don't know maybe it's just not

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.180 
because I don't know maybe it's just not
heated<00:04:32.390> up<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:32.710> even<00:04:33.710> though<00:04:33.800> this<00:04:33.920> doesn't
