00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.110
 rumba blues tonality salt 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.219
 if you want to play it with some 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.260
 friends guitarists then I recorded a video

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.390
 blues it is with the same key 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.879
 if you want to somehow combine it 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:54.180
 you can watch this video show 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.160

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.030
 queues you can hear like 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.550
 performance of the song king camp is sick he 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.450
 It plays there some kind of drawings 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.880
 let's break it down on a guitar and so 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.020
 we first break the main riff 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:17.100
 how he builds 7 logical and rhythmically 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:19.290
 he begins so what begins 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.640
 offense begins if you want it 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:30.150
 play that score will be like this 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:36.270
 one-two-three-four-times again 1 2 3 4 1 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:40.110
 that is, it starts at 1 and because 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.710
 tact and when we played this here we 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.079
 come in the first beat of the first measure 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.070
 square now analyze the note aspect 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:53.180
 this solo that we have we have 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.180
 total pentatonic 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:03.310
 the most popular position and these two 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.310
 notes 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:15.050
 second step tonality salt and 6 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:15.050
 major and here from rc minutes 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.770
 to major begins but on the third 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.580
 position on the fifth fret of the second string 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:31.160
 little finger on the sixth fret of the first string we 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.070
 we extract two notes by the loops mediator 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:43.570
 simultaneously with the little finger we pull up this 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:43.570
 note and mute with your right hand 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:53.170
 and floors from 5 to the first string to 3 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.510
 eco 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.690

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.430
 5 3 strings 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:19.970
 and fast homerun from 3 frets to 4 3 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:23.300
 strings from important rhythmically everything is correct 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:33.020
 make it short but then the first first two 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:39.800
 notes and last too short second 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:45.110
 the phrase is also built only here we 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:52.550
 we play not both of these but there is a plectrum game 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:55.690
 god and they sound like 2 8r all together 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.690
 two phrases 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.150
 the next phrase will lead us on the soup 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.150
 dominant on the chord 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:18.500

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:59.650
 then back to the salt again 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.650

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.949

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:11.630

00:05:57.329 --> 00:06:12.059
