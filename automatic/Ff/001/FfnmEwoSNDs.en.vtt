youtube or render it to your hard drive

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.939 
youtube or render it to your hard drive
so<00:00:51.300> like<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.570> said<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.930> very<00:00:52.170> basic<00:00:52.620> so<00:00:52.770> don't

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
so like I said it's very basic so don't

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.279 
so like I said it's very basic so don't
expect<00:00:53.070> a<00:00:53.340> lot<00:00:53.460> of<00:00:53.579> flexibility<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:55.110> good

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
expect a lot of flexibility it's good

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.569 
expect a lot of flexibility it's good
enough<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.860> started<00:00:55.890> making<00:00:56.309> YouTube

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
enough to get you started making YouTube

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.060 
enough to get you started making YouTube
videos<00:00:56.789> though<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.600> it's<00:00:58.530> pretty<00:00:58.680> nice<00:00:58.829> that

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
videos though so it's pretty nice that

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.340 
videos though so it's pretty nice that
they<00:00:59.190> included<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.760> the<00:01:00.600> overall<00:01:00.989> design<00:01:01.109> of

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
they included it the overall design of

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.860 
they included it the overall design of
the<00:01:01.649> HD<00:01:01.980> PVR<00:01:02.010> 2<00:01:02.430> itself<00:01:02.940> is<00:01:03.120> nice<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.600> looks<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
the HD PVR 2 itself is nice and looks a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.479 
the HD PVR 2 itself is nice and looks a
lot<00:01:03.989> better<00:01:04.170> compared<00:01:04.619> to<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.860> older<00:01:05.129> models

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
lot better compared to the older models

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.190 
lot better compared to the older models
it<00:01:05.729> even<00:01:05.939> has<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> record<00:01:06.540> button<00:01:06.810> on<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.020> top

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
it even has a record button on the top

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.469 
it even has a record button on the top
of<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.530> which<00:01:08.280> will<00:01:08.490> open<00:01:08.729> up<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.090> recording

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
of it which will open up the recording

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.120 
of it which will open up the recording
program<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.140> start<00:01:10.229> recording<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.979> you

program and start recording for you
which<00:01:11.880> is<00:01:12.030> very<00:01:12.090> useful<00:01:12.330> when<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.900> need<00:01:12.930> to

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
which is very useful when you need to

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.760 
which is very useful when you need to
record<00:01:13.380> something<00:01:13.680> fast<00:01:14.840> now<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.900> HD<00:01:16.290> PVR<00:01:16.320> 2

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
record something fast now the HD PVR 2

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.740 
record something fast now the HD PVR 2
does<00:01:17.159> have<00:01:17.340> better<00:01:17.580> quality<00:01:17.729> over<00:01:18.330> the<00:01:18.420> HD<00:01:18.720> PVR

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
does have better quality over the HD PVR

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.679 
does have better quality over the HD PVR
one<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> better<00:01:19.979> contrast<00:01:20.520> in<00:01:20.729> color<00:01:20.939> I'll

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
one with a better contrast in color I'll

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.289 
one with a better contrast in color I'll
be<00:01:21.900> showing<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.380> a<00:01:22.409> footage<00:01:23.100> of<00:01:23.220> that

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
be showing you a footage of that

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.270 
be showing you a footage of that
comparing<00:01:24.299> the<00:01:24.390> two<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:25.619> can<00:01:25.799> record<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
comparing the two and you can record the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.910 
comparing the two and you can record the
xbox<00:01:26.640> 360<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.150> full<00:01:27.390> 1080p<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.170> unfortunately

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
xbox 360 a full 1080p but unfortunately

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.850 
xbox 360 a full 1080p but unfortunately
the<00:01:29.070> HD<00:01:29.369> PVR<00:01:29.400> 2<00:01:29.990> doesn't<00:01:30.990> record<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.380> ps3

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the HD PVR 2 doesn't record the ps3

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.830 
the HD PVR 2 doesn't record the ps3
through<00:01:32.070> HDMI<00:01:32.670> meaning<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.420> record

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
through HDMI meaning that you can record

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.800 
through HDMI meaning that you can record
in<00:01:33.990> 1080p<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:34.829> instead<00:01:35.189> 1080i<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.329> there<00:01:36.659> is<00:01:36.780> a

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
in 1080p but instead 1080i so there is a

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
in 1080p but instead 1080i so there is a
bit<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> quality<00:01:37.530> loss<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.130> overall<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.670> still

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
bit of quality loss but overall it still

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.300 
bit of quality loss but overall it still
looks<00:01:39.090> good<00:01:39.380> one<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.530> other<00:01:40.650> downsides<00:01:41.189> I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
looks good one of the other downsides I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.859 
looks good one of the other downsides I
do<00:01:41.369> have<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.090> switching<00:01:42.450> between<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
do have is that switching between the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.870 
do have is that switching between the
video<00:01:42.990> source<00:01:43.470> can<00:01:43.799> be<00:01:43.829> a<00:01:43.950> bit<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.310> pain<00:01:44.520> when

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
video source can be a bit of a pain when

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.609 
video source can be a bit of a pain when
you<00:01:44.939> want<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.210> switch<00:01:45.360> between<00:01:45.509> consoles<00:01:46.200> and

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
you want to switch between consoles and

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:49.429 
you want to switch between consoles and
the<00:01:47.520> HD<00:01:47.790> PVR<00:01:47.820> 2<00:01:48.240> does<00:01:48.630> not<00:01:48.810> support<00:01:49.170> live

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
the HD PVR 2 does not support live

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.200 
the HD PVR 2 does not support live
streaming<00:01:49.799> so<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.610> you're<00:01:50.759> looking<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.090> do

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
streaming so if you're looking to do

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.460 
streaming so if you're looking to do
that<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.600> probably<00:01:52.020> isn't<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.409> best

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
that this probably isn't the best

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.520 
that this probably isn't the best
solution<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.810> as<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.960> can<00:01:55.079> see<00:01:55.110> from<00:01:55.350> this

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
solution and as you can see from this

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.260 
solution and as you can see from this
footage<00:01:55.890> what<00:01:56.280> stands<00:01:56.520> out<00:01:56.700> the<00:01:56.850> most<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.210> a

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
footage what stands out the most is a

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.840 
footage what stands out the most is a
contrast<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.960> color<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:58.520> it<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.640> bit

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
contrast in color and it is a bit

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.730 
contrast in color and it is a bit
sharper<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.960> one<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.259> things<00:02:01.320> I<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:01.680> the

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
sharper but one of the things I like the

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.980 
sharper but one of the things I like the
most<00:02:01.890> is<00:02:02.250> when<00:02:02.399> I'm<00:02:02.549> playing<00:02:02.670> on<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> xbox<00:02:03.119> 360

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
most is when I'm playing on the xbox 360

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.819 
most is when I'm playing on the xbox 360
