00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:21.840
 hello everybody there doing one more time 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:26.220
 years of thinking about the kitchen that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.980
 it would be a geek site that is done 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.109
 year in Korean jack is a roll in the 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.860
 very interesting and expensive toothpick 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.680
 tasty and good sausage if you do not learn 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.300
 the recipe that was made to head 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.000
 you are so good 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.590
 if you vote on who the 67 national 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.010
 That 's our recipe. Let's go there. 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.010
 kitchen 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:54.480
 we started making our breaded 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:58.190
 We'll get a cup of half cornmeal. 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.190
 Cup of flour 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.540
 We have an average and a half cup mexidinha 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:10.979
 milk but they add to the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.490
 few are the mass it is well squishy 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.729
 So look at us being able to talk to 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.939
 XATA our partner for our potatoes you 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.970
 can use the frozen paw or which is 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:27.360
 traditional peeling potatoes and chopping 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.890
 they in which challenges are in pieces 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.630
 small 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.820
 This is frozen here. 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.390
 I want to explain our sausage our 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.700
 Hot dog and I put it on a 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.280
 partnership completed and small to stay 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.299
 It's easier for us to fry our 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.979
 hot dog 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.479
 Now we're going to take a break in the 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:57.689
 sausage is that it is more or less 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:01.790
 here we go from the middle of it and let's go 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:08.020
 get a barbecue stick and let's go 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:13.090
 put in the center up to the tip 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:13.090
 We're going to do with all your chips 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:27.220
 let's start now get alone and 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.220
 do not pass on that crime we did 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:42.640
 one party had to take the excess and we 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.640
 in our potato 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:54.660
 now we go in that oil already hot 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.660
 for us and fry 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.010
 complaint in stressing to what causes 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.010
 radinho 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:36.980

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.030

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:46.340
