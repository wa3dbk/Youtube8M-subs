00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.500
 Welcome to our Sapucaia moment, a special moment where we get to know the best recipes with Sapucaia. 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:32.600
 Today we present a true classic: the globally renowned caipirinha. 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:45.300
 First we take a lime. We cut the ends off, and then cut it in half, like this. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:01:02.000
 We use a special glass that we call the "ilhabela". The glass is an essential part, specially developed for our caipirinha. 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:12.200
 You should actually use this glass to make our fantastic classic caipirinha. 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 Put the lime wedges in a glass, and add a level spoon of sugar. Take your muddler and squeeze the juice out of the lime. 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.900
 Be careful not to press too hard. 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.300
 Then we add ice cubes. So. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:54.680
 And now for that fantastic moment when we have been adding our traditional cachaça for 80 years. 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:05.600
 A delicious caipirinha made with cachaça Sapucaia Cristal - aged two years in Amendoim barrels. And now, if you allow me, I'll give him a taste. 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:22.600
 I hope you will enjoy it. In addition to this recipe, you can find many other Sapucaia recipes on www.cheftv.com.br
