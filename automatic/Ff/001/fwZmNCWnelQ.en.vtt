00:00:04.873 --> 00:00:06.973
 What do the bottles eat for breakfast? 

00:00:07.508 --> 00:00:10.261
 I do not know how yours, but mine ... 

00:00:10.278 --> 00:00:12.761
 knows how to devour eggs! 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.491
 Unfortunately, bottle feeding can be dangerous. 

00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:20.768
 Therefore, please help my dad. 

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:25.641
 The egg must be cooked hard and peeled smoothly from the skin. 

00:00:26.593 --> 00:00:30.220
 Of course, it must also be larger than the bottle opening. 

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.521
 Otherwise, there would be no trick. 

00:00:33.743 --> 00:00:39.418
 To wake up the dragon's appetite of the bottle, we need a watt with burning spirit. 

00:00:39.895 --> 00:00:41.220
 And dad. 

00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:49.946
 When the fire of my dragon-fire-devil fires in the belly 

00:00:50.018 --> 00:00:52.118
 you need to lay an egg quickly. 

00:00:54.395 --> 00:00:59.228
 I think my dragon tasted an egg because he swallowed them whole. 

00:00:59.522 --> 00:01:01.622
 But how to get them out now? 

00:01:01.673 --> 00:01:05.275
 My father uses a centrifugal force for this. 

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:10.116
 At the same time, watch a movie about a crazy juice. 

00:01:10.331 --> 00:01:14.339
 Are you worried that your chicken did not stand eggs today? 

00:01:14.665 --> 00:01:17.465
 You can feed the dragon with a water balloon. 

00:01:30.768 --> 00:01:34.966
 If you read in a book that oxygen burned out in a bottle 

00:01:34.974 --> 00:01:38.037
 and that's why the egg was pulled in, 

00:01:38.165 --> 00:01:43.085
 it will be only a small and insignificant part of the explanation. 

00:01:44.022 --> 00:01:46.656
 The bottle actually fills the air, 

00:01:46.696 --> 00:01:51.259
 and about one-fifth of the air in a bottle is oxygen. 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:56.990
 During the combustion of alcohol and some oxygen from the bottle 

00:01:57.021 --> 00:01:59.947
 they turn into water and carbon dioxide. 

00:01:59.974 --> 00:02:04.053
 So, indeed, a little bit of oxygen in the bottle decreases. 

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:06.143
 But very little. 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.378
 It would not explain such a swift swallowing of an egg. 

00:02:10.427 --> 00:02:15.521
 Above all, the flame heats the air in the bottle, 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.076
 which expands and goes outside. 

00:02:18.942 --> 00:02:21.742
 If you put the balloon fast enough, 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.124
 You would see that he is jumping. 

00:02:24.204 --> 00:02:28.482
 He jumps up by the air coming out of the bottle. 

00:02:28.522 --> 00:02:34.148
 When the flame goes out, the air quickly cools off the bottle. 

00:02:34.204 --> 00:02:37.291
 It cools and shrinks. 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:41.228
 As he shrinks, he sucks the balloon inside. 

00:02:41.339 --> 00:02:43.159
 Balloon or egg. 

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:47.529
 You will see a similar experiment in the film titled "Cookie bubbles". 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.561
 And now with your father or with some other adult 

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:55.656
 check if you have a bottle at home that devour eggs or balloons. 

00:02:56.371 --> 00:02:58.529
 Experimenting is cool and cheap. 

00:02:58.601 --> 00:03:01.325

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.449
 and sometimes a bit of chemistry.
