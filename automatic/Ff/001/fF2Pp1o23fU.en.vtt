00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 the headset procedure the hi lg 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.130
 model h 222 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.690
 It is a very simple procedure but 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.040
 helps a lot when your device 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.070
 is experiencing some problem 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.410
 related to software such as slowness and 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.090
 errors with apps or at home and you 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.949
 have forgotten the unlock pattern or 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.920
 even the password 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:27.539
 so let's go to the tutorial here 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.390
 you 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.680
 suppose you have forgotten the 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.930
 unlock pattern and is out of power 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.280
 use the device 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.280
 so you'll turn it off 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.170
 and disconnected with it preferably without 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.560
 chip without a memory card does not 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.630
 hold the pomegranate key down and 

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.440
 the power key on and off until the 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.440
 name lg 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.240
 when name l appeared you let go and 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.620
 press the power button again and 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.530
 off when this screen appears . 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:24.460
 reset you release the two keys with the 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:27.090
 Down volume key goes on irs and 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.760
 confirm on power button 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.479
 then again you will go on irs and 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:33.479
 confirm 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.480
 you are now formatting all the 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.760
 data contained in the internal memory of the 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.840
 device and restoring all 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.840
 Factory Default Settings 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.649
 this procedure is a little time-consuming 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.920
 but it's normal 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.439
 will end and will restart and when 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.289
 connecting is already fully restored from 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:09.489
 the first initiation after a 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:12.640
 reset is very time consuming but normal 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.620
 Have a little patience and you'll give 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.480
 It's all right, I'll go a little bit further. 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.480
 a video not to be so tiring 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.170
 So that's it, I just hope it works out. 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.150
 If you click right, I do not like it. 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.810
 subscribe to the channel and I'm staying for 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.150
 on here 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.150
 A big hug and, bye.
