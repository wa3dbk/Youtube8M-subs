00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.890
 go 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.200
 I'm Yaroslava rope guitarist groups tank 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.420
 on Maidani Congo in my hands 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.850
 mahogany tool 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.390
 and what is important from the whole 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.629
 wood not plywood but ibanez art series 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.370
 wood premium tool ie 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.370
 this is already a professional level 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.430
 I somehow tried to write a similar guitar 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.890
 in the studio the top is made of red 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.870
 wood here from a single piece of red 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:05.770
 wood that gives the sound of deep portage 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:09.900
 giving character without losing 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.900
 brightness sounding instrument 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.850
 husband 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:43.210
 the tool body is called grand 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.880
 of the concert he is not fat he is not thin it 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.900
 something average is and that's convenient 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.080
 wear and 

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:53.530
 and it sounds great and as if separate 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.770
 praise I think deserves coverage 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.350
 The tool is such a matte varnish 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.930
 which does not cover mirror 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.149
 tool so that it glitters and he 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.710
 it 's just that he will have all his pores here 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:07.930
 tree that is when you take it in hand 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.940
 you feel what she is rough mikoyana 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:11.860
 nice mechanic grover 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.270
 mechanic grover that japanese mechanic 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:19.090
 sufficiently high quality pegs that is 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.410
 problems with the fact that the guitar will upset you 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.110
 in progress 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.930
 there is no should i work with 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.510
 similar pegs for 6 years on my 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.970
 the guitar is also worth such 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.540
 I am satisfied and complaints yet I 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.700
 not 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.750
 the tool is very here and it seems to me in 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.800
 stylistically closer here is jazz flamenco 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.960
 what is it like that 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:46.880
 it sounds like a classic sound 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.830
 the same American sound, that's all 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.830
 here is in this tool 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.700
 and 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.730
 and 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:37.500
 And here I am a longtime fan of the company Alban 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.659
 Now I do not even know what tool is not 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.080
 I liked more than the tools 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:47.099
 manufactured by this company because 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.060
 Now all that is in all of these tools 

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:51.390
 it works for me 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:55.290
 it is both quality and combinations of gold 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:57.180
 The middle of the combination of price and quality 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.879
 have this not a tool for sky-high 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.230
 whale money by and large similar 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:05.819
 the tool can afford any 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:09.920
 man and have for that money 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.920
 very high grade tool
