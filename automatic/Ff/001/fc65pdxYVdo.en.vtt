00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:09.850
 hi friends from 3-9 dotcom i am david and 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:14.770
 today I want to introduce you to the house 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:18.490
 skechers are you go run right number 3 in 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:21.400
 the version already version 3 as you know 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.910
 the house skechers is a house a giant 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:27.280
 of footwear and relatively recently 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.510
 which has its performance division that is 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:33.879
 a range of sneaker ping both 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:38.199
 to run trail running as running 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:41.300
 of asphalt road of the highest 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.680
 level of the performance series we said 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.329
 competition and for things already really 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.449
 you know you already have a lot 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.719
 footwear from other ranges of 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:54.059
 also from street as the range 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.149
 performance that would be these fat 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.850
 rai3 would be from this series performance there 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.140
 to say that's not a shoe 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.619
 purely from trail but we've wanted it 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.720
 analyze because as you will see in our 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.080
 website we wanted to make a 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.860
 review to these run rai3 since 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.479
 many of you have asked us 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.210
 good to begin with, we have to say that 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.830
 this shoe logically you can not 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.250
 have in your hands now now 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.429
 you can have in your eyes but it is 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.380
 a super ultra light super shoe 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:31.080
 ultra light we are talking about very 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.429
 little weight and as you can see is a sneaker 

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.429
 super flexible 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:40.920
 I can think easily without doing much 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.180
 strength that I have a lot of strength but not 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.840
 I'm going to do 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.650
 and as you see super friendly even the 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.270
 upper is a is super simple even 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.980
 the protections that we will then see 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.730
 They are super friendly 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.260
 very comfortable watching this shoe and me 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.540
 The first thing I asked myself is 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:06.040
 because not all shoes can 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.990
 be that comfortable theoretically in theory 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.420
 I suppose there are some because it's 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:16.690
 reasons that we will logically see in the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.730
 review let's see first this sole 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.480
 we have seen the flexibility let's see 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.120
 this sole fixes that sounds almost no 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.600
 since everything you see in white 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.430
 belongs to the midsole and fixes 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.360
 what would be sole sole 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:36.300
 would be this kind of green dots that 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.520
 yes that is a lot more material 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.910
 tough is what would be the google 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.770
 impulse that is some these tacos here that 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.440
 they move independently but that 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.170
 the time they do all this part of 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.660
 stabilization there is a tread and that 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.220
 they can also act together 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.260
 that as you see for example in these 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.540
 lines in these parts here can be 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.100
 ally to give some stability to the 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.740
 tread as you see the toe also 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:05.530
 resort cover of this material a 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.380
 bit harder this is fine what 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.209
 do is give more feeling to the tread or 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.600
 they are more sensitive they make us feel 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:16.510
 more in the field they give more reactivity 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.940
 that would be once we entered and bounced 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.820
 better 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:24.360
 and they do also provide greater 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:26.370
 stability therefore in this sense 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:29.370
 to take into account this technology the 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.160
 wing pools of skechers a mean only 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.670
 as you see with medium profiles and a drop 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:39.000
 from back forward to just 4 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.620
 mm therefore a run 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.769
 pretty natural 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.510
 let's go what the upper would be like 

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:48.610
 I said before super flexible indeed 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:52.209
 is flexible in all four directions 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:54.930
 look like there is not much problem in 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.640
 this sense we will have to see how it 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:00.370
 they stabilize as they grab everything 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:04.209
 would be our foot we also have in 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:07.299
 this v in this in this aspect as 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:11.709
 try to hold a little support of the foot 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:14.260
 with this v both on the outer side 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:17.289
 as in the interior to favor a 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.440
 little the fixation fixes that I can 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:23.139
 fold also ultra easy therefore 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.990
 we will have to see how is this association 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:28.780
 flexible apple with very protections 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.880
 kind as you see here and an upper 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:37.590
 built in a material 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:40.440
 what is the lyon and what is against the 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:43.260
 bacteria therefore will not smell in 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.140
 theory in no time think that 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.750
 although you are seeing this yellow part 

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.190
 It's a shoe that has no templates 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.130
 therefore it can be carried 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:57.090
 quietly without a template because the 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:05:02.409
 template I'm going to show you here 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:06.249
 it is optional and comes separately 

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:09.909
 in a sachet here even the indicated 

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:12.249
 to wear with or without templates so 

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:15.699
 So much in this sense it has to be said that 

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:19.089
 the finish is very good is a fabric 

00:05:15.699 --> 00:05:21.330
 very nice going above average 

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:23.499
 sole to make a small bag 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:25.040
 logically when we put the foot in 

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:27.590
 it's going to end 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:31.640
 I already tell you that I had a chance to 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.950
 get up to speed with phishing and the 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.900
 truth is that the sensation changes 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.970
 quite 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:41.600
 and well, I particularly like it 

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:43.940
 more without but all this is subjective as 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.240
 You see, logically, they do not have a type of 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.669
 structure an internal collar that does 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:54.370
 this pretty 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:56.199
 extra padding in this sense 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.060
 and also it has to be said that it is a bit 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:05:59.830
 wider from the front to 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:02.229
 leave more space especially when 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:05.500
 we step on you already know that the fingers tend 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:08.560
 to expand even one centimeter by 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.330
 so a bit wider in the part 

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.430
 front in terms of templates 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:14.080
 tell you that we had seen information 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:19.060
 that belonged to the hunter of olite 

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:21.460
 but I practically tell you not like that 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:24.280
 practically sure I say no 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:25.900
 let's see now look closely 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.440
 blueprints 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:33.070
 enough buttonholes in very little space and 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:35.169
 a relatively padded tongue 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:36.639
 that I believe that he will fulfill his mission 

00:06:35.169 --> 00:06:38.830
 perfectly as it is not a sneaker 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.789
 of 30 does not have protection for the 

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:43.539
 land entrance look here there's no 

00:06:41.789 --> 00:06:45.550
 shoots good there's no protection 

00:06:43.539 --> 00:06:48.130
 directly and the inside of the 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.530
 shoe so it is very well cared for 

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:53.320
 with this seam so pull me towards 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:56.199
 inside that logically we will not notice 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.720
 not at all a shoe can not say 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.550
 that ultra comfortable 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.610
 and that even though I have this 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:05.470
 so big flexibility let's have 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:10.460
 to see how the durability works 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:12.800
 of this skechers run raid 3 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:14.569
 you are going to have the opportunity to see the 

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:18.800
 definitive analysis on our page

 from the world of the train the net we are going to 

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:39.860
 explain how this has worked 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:41.780
 model the raid 3 because the truth 

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:44.000
 we are very curious about this 

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.400
 Ultra light brand and we will give you 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.849
 answers about why not all 

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.889
 shoes can be so light or that 

00:07:49.849 --> 00:07:54.259
 they are doing more the other houses for 

00:07:51.889 --> 00:07:57.440
 that is not as light as this 

00:07:54.259 --> 00:07:59.060
 go raid 3 therefore friends os 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.620
