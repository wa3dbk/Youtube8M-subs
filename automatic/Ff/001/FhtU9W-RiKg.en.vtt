00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.789
 of having seen all the space and 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.789
 wrong 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.610
 live 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:22.610
 good people here generate tagline in 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.220
 another new video in this case we are going to 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.660
 do a little review of the direct that 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.480
 they made prison for the elderly 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.460
 agree and nothing will we see what 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.260
 would be points of view the points 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.879
 more interesting that this would have 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.339
 agreement let's go in a quick review 

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:40.430
 and so we can understand this would be the 

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:42.350
 first mission agreed that would be what 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.000
 which is the old man's prison here 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.520
 reward we would have what is 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.480
 reputation of the judgment house 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:50.180
 We would also have a reputation for 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.489
 vanguard would give us in 25 points teaches 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.680
 of the vanguard would give us 6 and also 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.140
 would give us a grama of the first grudge of 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.250
 agreement that is what would not be necessary to 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.830
 level 28 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.140
 to enter here here if there is more machine 

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:06.420
 the only mission that there would be more kingfisher 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.640
 I was going to agree 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.890
 now let's move on to the second one that 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.770
 it would be at level 32 that we would have what 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.869
 is the legion broken according here the one 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.920
 I was commenting here there's no more maximum 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.479
 okay here we would have to enter 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.770
 with a group of three facts and of 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.450
 reward we would have what is the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.420
 reputation of the judgment house 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.150
 we would have more 200 plus a core of 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.010
 armor in accordance we would follow 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.250
 we would go to this one that is a little bit more 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.890
 high at level 34 that would be the ring the 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.930
 European record of agreement here either 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:39.550
 we would have more machine and we would have to 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.770
 stop the group of three players that 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.390
 payment inside and nothing the reward that 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.070
 we would have the reputation of the house 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.290
 of the exercise we would have more 300 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.840
 we would have the ethereal light that I am 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.179
 very important and in core for the soul 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.659
 and finally we would have the level 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:58.460
 35 that is the revenge of escolas here 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.259
 we would not have more masking than what 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.539
 we see bad but good would be three 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.700
 players the full group and of 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.679
 reward we would have the theoretical lights 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.720
 that this is super important the core 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:10.190
 of armor core of weapons and of 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.489
 reputation of the judgment house 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.470
 we would have more 500 agreed this would be 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:20.190
 let's say the most complicated of zacango 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.330
 It's super important also in the 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.070
 of level 28 we go to level 32 or 34 35 in 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.410
 whatever the agreement we would have five 

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.630
 rounds for each one if we want to do 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.540
 a mission we would have five rounds in 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:36.480
 each round had three waves say 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.400
 bad in the first four rounds 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.260
 they would be wave after wave and in the last 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.090
 round would be a random head of agreement 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.700
 a boss who can leave you the same 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.370
 bad treatment that the 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.990
 seventh prime as we would bring something else 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.280
 very important that you have this too 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:51.690
 are the new modifiers left 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.150
 posts we've put a few that 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.640
 they are very good as he is harder than 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.490
 redouble damage of major weapons or 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.170
 we also have some that are at 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.540
 otherwise we say the skills 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.340
 because it would be filled more slowly than 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.600
 you have to work near the 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.070
 new modifiers according 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.660
 and speaking of game development there are 

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.320
 four sand according sand lime 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.300
 belongs to say enemies and there are the 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.030
 of the hive in the cabales are the 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.920
 you see and are the fallen ones of agreement then 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.120
 each map would belong what to one of 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.190
 them from there and also the waves that 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.160
 it comes out in what randomly can you 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.600
 touch the same of one or the other and nothing 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.620
 what we're going at a glance and already as 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:41.590
 you have seen would be the rom would be the 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.570
 five rom that there are are final bosses for 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.190
 that we see a little bit above though 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.410
 be quick according to what they would be 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:49.570
 the four scenarios and what would be the 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.090
 final boss as you have seen that 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:55.959
 little light of red cage 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:59.319
 those are cheats of agreement would be 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:00.760
 pumps are traps of various types there 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.200
 of those that trap you and leave you 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.209
 slowed down 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.650
 there are those who kill you directly there 

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:07.180
 several agree that you have to be 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.990
 also very aware of those little things 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.890
 new 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.690
 at 5 we dedicate that oslo 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.820
 the three waves that we have to do 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.430
 for each rum for saying it right because 

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.709
 finish 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.650
 you can touch then the first wave 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:26.620
 kills only enemies that 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.770
 same can you touch deactivate a guy 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.729
 of pump of agreement that can touch you 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:36.219
 eliminate a certain enemy 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:38.379
 they do not always have to kill 

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:40.620
 only to waves of agreement that you 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:43.270
 they put what enough difficulty 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.830
 enough difficulty in each level court 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.779
 will have more difficulties in charge of 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.789
 will speak later four more 

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:50.830
 difficulty now fine but that is not 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:52.839
 only kill as muse started I believed the 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.520
 agreement that we must also do several 

00:04:52.839 --> 00:04:57.520
 things for example as I said we have 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.819
 killed an enemy or disable three 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.309
 points that give you a certain let's say a 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:06.219
 time limit because they are 30 seconds 

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:08.710
 does not arrive the minute go and that will be 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:10.240
 quite entertaining the same thing else 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.439
 that we must highlight the deaths of 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.529
 comrades the death of comrades 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:16.330
 of 30 seconds is neither 10 nor 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:18.419
 least agree and that's very very 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.419
 important 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:23.090
 and good as we have already seen the four 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:26.330
 Sands of agreement and already this would be the 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:28.490
 weapons that have taken out that is for the 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:32.449
 pressure of the elderly 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:35.809
 let's say at last they would be thematized 

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:37.309
 as we wrote it in atheists were 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:39.439
 It thematizes Pateón like the ones we've seen 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:42.409
 in crota that already came with skull in the 

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:44.389
 cafetín or equal and already what we are going to 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:46.610
 do directly goes to the speakers 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.980
 agreement for us to see it because I 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:51.740
 I think this has been seen by few people 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.930
 that would be in this case it seems to me 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:58.020
 that a cousin brother of valued 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:06:00.120
 of agreement this would be what is rum 5 already 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:01.620
 you can pass the four waves good 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:06.139
 the four round of the three waves 

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:06.139
 each one would be the final point 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:11.130
 and let's see how it is turning in 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:13.830
 medium because it is to have direct in return 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:16.440
 goes away from cuntis is here absent with 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:21.900
 you win but good he wears a whole suit 

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:24.000
 and improve it because a lot of people are a 

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:25.410
 doubt that I wanted to remove because it 's with the 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.370
 same topic a lot of people have told me that 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:30.590
 this because I had not uploaded it 

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:32.900
 and why he had not come up straight 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:35.139
 direct I never had nor will I ever go 

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:37.550
 a live show that were let's say in English 

00:06:35.139 --> 00:06:39.139
 because if I did not understand it so that the 

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:41.570
 Mexican zeros agreement I try 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:44.960
 explain it as best you can not only 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:46.760
 I can and I prefer to do well 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.990
 I remember that it takes an audi already because 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.250
 I do not have time I 'm going to take out a 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:51.080
 shore to try to do the best 

00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:52.729
 that can and is already 

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.240
 As you have seen, it has been entrusted to 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:58.310
 final is a 5 and nothing there has the prize 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.990
 that we 're going to agree on everything 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:03.560
 besides there were no secrets left because 

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:05.570
 you can see all and nothing gentlemen 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.310
 I hope you liked this I hope that 

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:10.100
 I liked the application of the option 

00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:12.850
 of the old woman and nothing more healthy and 

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.850
 until others 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.590
 ah
