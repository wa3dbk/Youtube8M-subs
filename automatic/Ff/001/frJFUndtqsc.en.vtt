00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
type of atmosphere so I didn't have the

she do that but she I would say it's

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.380 
she do that but she I would say it's
probably<00:03:40.650> slowly<00:03:41.520> the<00:03:41.850> reason<00:03:42.150> that<00:03:42.180> I've

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
probably slowly the reason that I've

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.180 
probably slowly the reason that I've
moved<00:03:42.600> from<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.990> last<00:03:43.200> location<00:03:43.590> to<00:03:44.010> this

moved from the last location to this
location<00:03:44.670> she<00:03:45.450> gave<00:03:45.630> me<00:03:45.660> the<00:03:45.840> confidence<00:03:45.990> and

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
location she gave me the confidence and

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.010 
location she gave me the confidence and

become an obstacle for me I don't know

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:46.180 
become an obstacle for me I don't know
yet<00:04:44.000> if<00:04:44.630> the<00:04:44.900> parents<00:04:45.320> or<00:04:45.410> the<00:04:45.470> students<00:04:46.010> knew

over the past two years so that's

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.280 
over the past two years so that's
probably<00:04:55.790> my<00:04:56.090> biggest<00:04:56.240> obstacle<00:04:56.570> at<00:04:57.080> this
