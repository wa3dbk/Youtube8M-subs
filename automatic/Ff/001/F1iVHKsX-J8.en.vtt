00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
sectioning clips and what we're going to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:36.170 
sectioning clips and what we're going to
do<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.510> we're<00:00:30.779> going<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:30.960> section

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180

like<00:00:45.170> that<00:00:45.560> so<00:00:45.920> we've<00:00:46.070> got<00:00:46.250> a<00:00:46.550> thickness<00:00:47.300> of

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:47.630 
like that so we've got a thickness of

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.160 
like that so we've got a thickness of
the<00:00:47.810> hair<00:00:48.670> like<00:00:49.670> that<00:00:49.750> and<00:00:50.750> we're<00:00:50.960> going<00:00:51.080> to

use our heat protector spray and spray

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.689 
use our heat protector spray and spray
the<00:00:55.730> section<00:00:56.739> work<00:00:57.739> though<00:00:58.780> and<00:00:59.949> then<00:01:00.949> brush

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
the section work though and then brush

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.580 
the section work though and then brush
it<00:01:01.730> to<00:01:02.540> the<00:01:02.660> ends<00:01:06.369> then<00:01:07.369> we're<00:01:07.940> going<00:01:08.090> to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
it to the ends then we're going to

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.749 
it to the ends then we're going to
separate<00:01:09.700> the<00:01:10.700> hair<00:01:10.970> into<00:01:11.150> a<00:01:12.310> bring<00:01:13.310> it<00:01:13.490> to<00:01:13.670> the

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
in the straighteners and turn it 460

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.190

feeding into the judge gays blacks I
okay<00:01:29.240> and<00:01:29.539> then<00:01:30.080> you<00:01:30.200> can<00:01:30.380> see<00:01:30.740> we've<00:01:31.190> got<00:01:31.430> the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
okay and then you can see we've got the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.570 
okay and then you can see we've got the
natural<00:01:32.780> curl<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:35.440> then<00:01:36.440> do<00:01:37.130> in<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.399> other

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:37.580 
natural curl and then do in the other

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.440 
natural curl and then do in the other
side<00:01:38.860> take<00:01:39.860> in<00:01:40.039> smaller<00:01:40.340> sections<00:01:40.910> it<00:01:41.240> might

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
side take in smaller sections it might

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.609 
side take in smaller sections it might
be<00:01:41.600> easier<00:01:41.990> for<00:01:42.050> you<00:01:42.289> and<00:01:43.210> then<00:01:44.210> again<00:01:45.200> 10

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
be easier for you and then again 10

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
minute 360 degrees while feeding the

00:01:48.890 --> 00:02:00.690 
minute 360 degrees while feeding the
ends<00:01:49.280> into<00:01:49.810> the<00:01:50.810> ghd's<00:01:52.690> like<00:01:53.690> so

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:00.700 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.789 

but<00:02:01.299> what<00:02:01.509> what's<00:02:01.869> good<00:02:02.200> is<00:02:02.560> don't<00:02:04.259> don't<00:02:05.259> push

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:05.799 
but what what's good is don't don't push

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:09.389 
but what what's good is don't don't push
it<00:02:05.829> down<00:02:06.189> really<00:02:06.670> hard<00:02:06.789> kind<00:02:07.780> of<00:02:07.899> softly<00:02:08.739> feed

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
it down really hard kind of softly feed

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.339 
it down really hard kind of softly feed
it<00:02:09.550> through<00:02:09.580> I'll<00:02:10.119> but<00:02:10.810> you're<00:02:10.989> just<00:02:11.140> going<00:02:11.290> to

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
it through I'll but you're just going to

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:18.720 
it through I'll but you're just going to
get<00:02:11.440> jagged<00:02:11.860> lines<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:13.569> then<00:02:17.220> doing<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.370> next

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
get jagged lines and then doing the next

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.520 
get jagged lines and then doing the next
section<00:02:19.860> from<00:02:20.860> the<00:02:21.160> top<00:02:21.430> of<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.700> year<00:02:22.410> all<00:02:23.410> the

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
section from the top of the year all the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.199 
section from the top of the year all the
way<00:02:23.680> down<00:02:23.920> and<00:02:24.250> then<00:02:24.340> get<00:02:24.849> our<00:02:25.000> Clips<00:02:25.900> again

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
way down and then get our Clips again

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:34.930 
way down and then get our Clips again
popping<00:02:28.209> them<00:02:28.390> in

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.089 

again<00:02:35.940> separating<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> hair<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.620> you<00:02:37.680> can<00:02:37.890> see

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
again separating the hair so you can see

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:43.780 
again separating the hair so you can see
what<00:02:38.220> you're<00:02:38.310> doing<00:02:39.170> taking<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:42.170> bit<00:02:43.170> of<00:02:43.200> hair

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.479 
what you're doing taking a bit of hair
popping<00:02:44.790> the<00:02:45.030> straightness<00:02:45.480> for<00:02:46.160> 360<00:02:47.160> degrees

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
popping the straightness for 360 degrees

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.110 
popping the straightness for 360 degrees
and<00:02:47.989> then<00:02:48.989> feeding<00:02:49.349> the<00:02:49.620> hair<00:02:49.800> through<00:02:50.120> making

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
and then feeding the hair through making

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.150 
and then feeding the hair through making
sure<00:02:51.269> there's<00:02:51.540> nice<00:02:51.989> tension<00:02:54.319> if<00:02:55.319> there's<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
sure there's nice tension if there's the

sure there's nice tension if there's the
kick<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.459> bottom<00:02:56.730> then<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.150> curl<00:02:57.390> it

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.610 

looks<00:03:08.750> I

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
looks I

okay<00:03:18.550> so<00:03:18.610> taking<00:03:18.940> your<00:03:19.210> next<00:03:19.540> section

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:29.200 

from<00:03:24.230> above<00:03:24.590> your<00:03:24.800> eyes<00:03:25.690> and<00:03:26.690> place<00:03:27.500> in<00:03:28.210> the

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
curly but here's quite strikes we get

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:45.470 
curly but here's quite strikes we get
that<00:04:24.430> contrast<00:04:25.440> okay

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:47.900 

I<00:04:45.590> with<00:04:46.590> my<00:04:46.800> hair<00:04:47.070> I<00:04:47.100> have<00:04:47.340> a<00:04:47.370> lot<00:04:47.610> of<00:04:47.640> hair<00:04:47.880> to

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
I with my hair I have a lot of hair to

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.340 
I with my hair I have a lot of hair to
work<00:04:48.330> with<00:04:48.600> but<00:04:49.590> you<00:04:49.830> may<00:04:49.980> have<00:04:50.960> easier<00:04:51.960> to

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.420 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:06:12.380 

go<00:04:57.420> free

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:12.390
