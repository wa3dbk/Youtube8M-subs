00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.089
 hello people and welcome here 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.130
 back at ergo the 1 yes the first video 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:10.170
 after a longer or well until well 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.389
 now it's just under two weeks break 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.500
 and I just have a look 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.800
 I thought not start now times 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.119
 directly with aldi with him or with 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.619
 Career mode but sometimes with something completely 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.920
 I would like to do that 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:25.710
 integrate you into my videos and 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.390
 Although I would like to do so before 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.939
 I started again here instead 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.189
 with normal videos I would like now 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.050
 first collect a few teams 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.500
 I mean you certainly know the 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.950
 videos here on youtube team about this 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.230
 So I'm going to know squad pictures 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.910
 times very briefly show the so first 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.020
 the short new youtube home the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.070
 is completely screwed up 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:54.270
 Now we just do a squad 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.610
 pictures nonsense yes let me 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.550
 Let's write a squad here 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.920
 Pictures say that people just say 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.899
 always how much budget do you have ours 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.390
 say and then just tell us 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.010
 now have this and the team here 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.350
 made or the fastest team here 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.680
 the world anyway , first time and me 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.630
 Just like that you have me 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.060
 your favorite quads so yours 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.900
 favorite team or your favorite ones 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.420
 installation by pn sends and that with 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.710
 As for summer, this is called 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.369
 with the subject squad pictures 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.229
 favorite team somehow yes 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.750
 scott pictures or just write 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.430
 In any case, squad pictures in 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.859
 I 'll do it that way, that's me 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.000
 first a few 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:43.020
 so you can also look on the left 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.640
 several write in your pm 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.069
 I want the fact that I do so 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.569
 just a few left collectors of those 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:51.450
 I then I look at all of them 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:53.159
 and then I will gradually 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.969
 I always have a few teams of it 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.560
 imagine 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.810
 I especially liked and will 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.920
 then just always so if I'm 30 now 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.020
 I get five pieces first 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.759
 videos of which I always have three pieces 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.319
 I like that, I like that 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.950
 I like it and I like it 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:07.200
 I'm fine with that 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.250
 and yes, well that will be shut then 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.840
 In any case, I want to develop 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.610
 get involved with it a bit 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.549
 you just have to say the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.750
 left in the description post yet 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:16.110
 very fast so you know how it is 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.400
 going 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.019
 the on squad greta boutique.com and us 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.450
 then always call that 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.970
 the squad says sign up 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.890
 just ergo the 1 and then you will 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.120
 you make your formations out of information 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.890
 however formation 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.780
 I'll just guess now 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.440
 standard formation the 4 1 2 1 2 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.870
 and then you can be as funny here 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.459
 of course I just form a squad 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:43.440
 Say times are on 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.840
 in any case, a chemistry of at least 95 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.370
 because it should not be complete now 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.220
 the crew will be the dice 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.630
 I have a chemistry of 50, therefore 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.090
 say a chemistry of at least 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:56.459
 It should be 95 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:57.690
 otherwise there are not any 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.700
 you are allowed to give her further instructions 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:01.079
 do whatever you want 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.579
 of course, the whole in shape 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:06.000
 Smaller than that, how much 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.769
 it costs so now it's only in 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.230
 the series is about your first 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:14.160
 favorite to introduce and then 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.079
 I will eventually maybe even 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.819
 even in the spot to take pictures and video 

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:21.510
 maybe something like that again 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:23.400
 you are extremely cheap teams or extreme 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.510
 can build extravagant teams 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:29.069
 we'll just become that 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.319
 just sometime make time 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.120
 Enough is enough for it is so slow 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:34.319
 christmas to davids then anyway 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:36.010
 again a little quieter 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:39.110
 then you can go back 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.659
 nice to sit by the pc because it is so cold and 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.340
 watched the more videos again and it 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:44.810
 is going so slowly now so I start 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.629
 now i am also looking next 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:49.159
 Week again with the videos 

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:51.170
 now then as usual with old 

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.530
 with career mode and so on and so on 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.590
 on 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.510
 and here is now just new 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.849
 I hope you like it 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.629
 and I hope you will have fun 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:03.109
 have it 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:05.030
 So just send me a pn 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:06.290
 then get the feedback 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.400
 So that I have received so is 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.870
 In any case, I have a feedback 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.459
 I will save all the links and 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.750
 would create me a small rankings 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.849
 as I like best 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.019
 and yes just let's see something out of it 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.940
 Of course , the places will be the same 

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:18.440
 your channel above all so I say then 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.239
 just good is from the and the canal 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.620
 or if you still have your name 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.350
 I also want to write 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.789
 a good one here that is now that is 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.889
 now here the Beatrix wants now 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.099
 introduce your team here or as well 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:31.190
 always 

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:33.320
 yes that's it from me I hope that 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.860
 I like the idea I just expect 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:42.400
 times your pms and hope that a 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.400
 meet up then so realistic
