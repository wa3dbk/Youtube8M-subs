00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
with the way the players reacted you

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.300 
with the way the players reacted you
could<00:02:11.300> always<00:02:11.450> tell<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:12.110> health<00:02:12.320> and<00:02:12.620> the

they knew themselves do you think in the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.800 
they knew themselves do you think in the
future<00:02:16.100> because<00:02:16.880> everybody<00:02:17.420> must<00:02:17.690> be

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
body must be different and in the future

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.110 
body must be different and in the future
they<00:02:21.260> also<00:02:21.380> like<00:02:21.620> litmus<00:02:22.070> paper<00:02:22.340> test<00:02:22.700> people

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
they also like litmus paper test people

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.610 
they also like litmus paper test people
the<00:02:23.540> players<00:02:23.840> do<00:02:24.170> you<00:02:24.260> think<00:02:24.380> they'll<00:02:24.470> get

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
the players do you think they'll get

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.620 
the players do you think they'll get
that<00:02:24.770> much<00:02:24.920> detail<00:02:25.160> and<00:02:25.550> say<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:26.360> need<00:02:26.510> this

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
that much detail and say you need this

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.120 
that much detail and say you need this
sort<00:02:26.840> of<00:02:26.930> fuel<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.410> you<00:02:27.500> need<00:02:27.650> that<00:02:27.770> sort<00:02:28.070> of

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.130 
sort of fuel and you need that sort of

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.480 
sort of fuel and you need that sort of
fuel<00:02:28.340> yes<00:02:28.670> I<00:02:29.660> think<00:02:30.380> there<00:02:30.800> is<00:02:30.830> I<00:02:31.190> mean<00:02:31.370> there's

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:31.490 
fuel yes I think there is I mean there's

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.250 
fuel yes I think there is I mean there's
a<00:02:31.550> lot<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.790> talk<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.660> interesting<00:02:33.020> is<00:02:33.080> a<00:02:33.140> lot

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
a lot of talk the interesting is a lot

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.640 
a lot of talk the interesting is a lot
of<00:02:33.380> a<00:02:33.590> lot<00:02:33.800> of<00:02:33.890> researches<00:02:34.520> until<00:02:34.850> done<00:02:35.810> has

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
of a lot of researches until done has

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.350 
of a lot of researches until done has
been<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:36.920> last<00:02:37.070> five<00:02:37.460> to<00:02:37.760> ten<00:02:37.970> years<00:02:38.000> about

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
been the last five to ten years about

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.320 
been the last five to ten years about
genetic<00:02:38.900> mapping<00:02:39.490> so<00:02:40.840> people<00:02:41.840> as<00:02:42.020> gene<00:02:42.440> types

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
genetic mapping so people as gene types

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.060 
genetic mapping so people as gene types
will<00:02:44.330> determine<00:02:44.840> how<00:02:45.170> they<00:02:45.350> respond<00:02:45.830> to

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:46.070 
will determine how they respond to

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.750 
will determine how they respond to
certain<00:02:46.340> types<00:02:46.730> of<00:02:46.970> foods<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:48.470> I<00:02:48.800> don't<00:02:49.490> I<00:02:49.640> know

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
certain types of foods so I don't I know

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.880 
certain types of foods so I don't I know
this<00:02:49.910> might<00:02:50.120> seem<00:02:50.330> pretty<00:02:50.540> far-fetched<00:02:50.870> but<00:02:51.830> I

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
this might seem pretty far-fetched but I

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.580 
this might seem pretty far-fetched but I
really<00:02:52.310> would<00:02:53.000> see<00:02:53.270> some<00:02:53.570> time<00:02:53.780> in<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:53.960> future

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
really would see some time in the future

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.860 
really would see some time in the future
you're<00:02:54.830> even<00:02:55.070> genetically<00:02:56.000> mapping<00:02:56.630> the

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
you're even genetically mapping the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:58.960 
you're even genetically mapping the
players<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:58.280> see<00:02:58.460> how<00:02:58.610> they're<00:02:58.760> going<00:02:58.880> to

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
players to see how they're going to

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.350 
players to see how they're going to
respond<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:01.280> I<00:03:01.400> think<00:03:01.580> the<00:03:01.640> advancement<00:03:02.270> in

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
respond and I think the advancement in

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.840 
respond and I think the advancement in
technology<00:03:02.540> all<00:03:03.080> around<00:03:03.380> in<00:03:03.740> all<00:03:04.100> sports<00:03:04.490> has

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:04.850 
technology all around in all sports has

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.210 
technology all around in all sports has
been<00:03:05.090> has<00:03:05.840> just<00:03:06.200> been<00:03:06.350> amazing<00:03:06.620> they're<00:03:06.950> not

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
been has just been amazing they're not

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.710 
been has just been amazing they're not
only<00:03:07.430> just<00:03:07.580> on<00:03:07.910> the<00:03:07.970> physical<00:03:08.300> side<00:03:08.360> but<00:03:08.630> the

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
only just on the physical side but the

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.380 
only just on the physical side but the
psychological<00:03:09.140> the<00:03:09.470> mental<00:03:09.770> side<00:03:10.120> so<00:03:11.120> there's

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
psychological the mental side so there's

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.090 
psychological the mental side so there's
a<00:03:11.450> little<00:03:11.570> bit<00:03:11.720> in<00:03:11.750> the<00:03:11.989> last<00:03:12.020> five<00:03:12.560> six<00:03:12.800> seven

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:13.100 
a little bit in the last five six seven

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.010 
a little bit in the last five six seven
years<00:03:13.130> a<00:03:13.280> lot<00:03:13.459> of<00:03:13.489> work<00:03:13.790> on<00:03:14.180> the<00:03:14.420> house<00:03:14.600> smell

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:15.020 
years a lot of work on the house smell

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.830 
years a lot of work on the house smell
can<00:03:15.290> help<00:03:15.500> performance<00:03:16.040> and<00:03:16.489> so<00:03:17.390> if<00:03:17.540> the<00:03:17.720> user

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
can help performance and so if the user

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.380 
can help performance and so if the user
with<00:03:18.110> golfers<00:03:18.560> they<00:03:18.739> do<00:03:18.800> it<00:03:18.980> with<00:03:19.180> even<00:03:20.180> if

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
with golfers they do it with even if

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.570 
with golfers they do it with even if
