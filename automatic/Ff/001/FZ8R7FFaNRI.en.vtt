let's<00:03:40.860> take<00:03:41.070> this<00:03:41.250> hole<00:03:41.880> fill<00:03:42.180> here<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.630> play

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
let's take this hole fill here and play

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.559 
let's take this hole fill here and play
it<00:03:43.739> at<00:03:43.950> 80<00:03:44.310> beats<00:03:44.519> per<00:03:44.670> minute<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.180> then<00:03:45.510> we'll

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:45.569 
it at 80 beats per minute and then we'll

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:46.729 
it at 80 beats per minute and then we'll
move<00:03:45.690> on<00:03:45.840> from<00:03:45.870> there<00:03:46.110> guys<00:03:46.319> just<00:03:46.560> so<00:03:46.650> I<00:03:46.680> can

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
move on from there guys just so I can

00:03:46.739 --> 00:04:25.990 
move on from there guys just so I can
get<00:03:46.980> a<00:03:47.040> feeling<00:03:47.340> of<00:03:47.400> the<00:03:47.489> timing<00:03:47.880> here<00:03:48.450> we<00:03:48.510> go

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.850 

so<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.120> concept<00:04:27.479> to<00:04:27.630> learn<00:04:27.810> here<00:04:28.140> is<00:04:28.320> a<00:04:28.350> fill

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
so the concept to learn here is a fill

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.340 
so the concept to learn here is a fill
with<00:04:29.669> a<00:04:29.910> bunch<00:04:30.240> of<00:04:30.450> possibilities<00:04:31.080> for

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
with a bunch of possibilities for
