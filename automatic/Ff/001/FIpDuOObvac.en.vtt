process<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:45.420> reason<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.930> say<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.200> it's

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
process the reason I say that it's

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.940 
process the reason I say that it's
because<00:01:47.130> 95%<00:01:47.640> of<00:01:48.420> your<00:01:48.570> time<00:01:48.869> in<00:01:49.170> an<00:01:49.320> MMO<00:01:49.680> is
