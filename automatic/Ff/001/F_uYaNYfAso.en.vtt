00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
sure yeah I do think a lot of it is

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.560 
sure yeah I do think a lot of it is
corporate<00:00:22.050> driven<00:00:22.350> here<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.119> it<00:00:24.119> is<00:00:24.180> related

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
corporate driven here and it is related

corporate driven here and it is related
to<00:00:24.810> money<00:00:24.960> unfortunately<00:00:25.640> modifying

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
to money unfortunately modifying

to money unfortunately modifying
genetically<00:00:27.330> food<00:00:27.570> is<00:00:27.720> totally<00:00:28.400> wicked<00:00:29.400> and

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
genetically food is totally wicked and

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.130 
genetically food is totally wicked and
controlling<00:00:30.300> they<00:00:30.420> want<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.689> take<00:00:30.840> over<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
controlling they want to take over the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.340 
controlling they want to take over the
soup<00:00:31.590> food<00:00:31.800> sources<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:32.850> mankind<00:00:33.329> so<00:00:33.600> they

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
soup food sources of a mankind so they

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.250 
soup food sources of a mankind so they
can<00:00:34.559> basically<00:00:34.710> push<00:00:35.250> up<00:00:35.370> on<00:00:35.489> us<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:36.329> why<00:00:36.780> are

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
can basically push up on us so why are

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.100 
can basically push up on us so why are
Americans<00:00:37.920> okay<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.640> i<00:00:38.940> think<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
Americans okay with that i think is the

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.930 
Americans okay with that i think is the

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
well I think our country is is run by

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.859 
well I think our country is is run by
greed<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.820> money<00:01:15.000> and<00:01:15.180> there's<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.600> lot<00:01:15.810> of

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
issues here so um is it say when the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.469 
issues here so um is it say when the
greed<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:20.070> strong<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:20.970> messes<00:01:21.299> with

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
greed is so strong that it messes with

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.100 
greed is so strong that it messes with
what<00:01:21.810> people<00:01:22.140> eat<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:23.240> think<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.450> think<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.930> just

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
what people eat I think I think you just

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.380 
what people eat I think I think you just
answer<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.530> question<00:01:26.220> with<00:01:26.580> your<00:01:26.790> question

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
do you think that because the population

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.789 
do you think that because the population
is<00:01:30.060> growing<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.720> growing<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.170> growing<00:01:31.259> that

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
is growing and growing and growing that

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.340 
is growing and growing and growing that
we're<00:01:32.040> bound<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.670> eat<00:01:32.850> things<00:01:33.180> like<00:01:33.329> meat<00:01:34.020> bait

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
we're bound to eat things like meat bait

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.020 
we're bound to eat things like meat bait
and<00:01:34.530> petri<00:01:34.920> dishes<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.490> those<00:01:35.610> kinds<00:01:35.970> of
