 bmx here a video especially for you 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.780
 who is entering the command 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.670
 Do you want a newbie here? I'll explain. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.490
 some basic things for you can 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.190
 take better advantage of the command 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.600
 so come on initially you have to 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.430
 learn that they can not kill any 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.050
 For example, the command 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.850
 get a member of the command 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.039
 save it not hear me also he 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.960
 Do not even know that I'm recording and you do not 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.640
 can kill for example he got here 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.449
 He's not going to kill me at all. 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.890
 death 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.040
 You can get here safely. 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.600
 I already honked here I'm going to have a roller 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.710
 with him and it's not even known that I 'm recording 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.030

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.950

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.379
 I already took a ride here on a member one. 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.239
 member is what I'm going to explain to you 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.670
 As you can see, you do not have to kill. 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.010
 can kill even in a way 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.750
 here I see another player in the 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.640
 true is my true profile that 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.620
 My mom makes me play now can see. 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.989
 that our players our members 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.869
 if they identify with this border is 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.150
 and our friends friends of the 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.000
 live and more command players if 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.400
 identify yellow and blue 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.590
 here are other members of the command until 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.930
 another here has another here either 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.330
 them if you arrive you can can 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.490
 arrive as good as they have just 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.110
 find another profile also 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.570
 members do this can arrive in good 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.270
 can not kill in any way unless 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.490
 that you two are already friends already 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.250
 have already entered into common 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.170
 and suddenly kill him for some reason. 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.060
 joking or even per head 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.140
 reward reward head not too 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.850
 It can kill 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.399
 You do not have any here in the session but also 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.680
 is this the same way here right type 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.229
 turning yellow only has red logic 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.570
 here with a xez can not kill too 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.460
 unless you combine and everything 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.470
 then you can kill yourself if you can 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.170
 what you want more initially 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.479
 Found a member, this is it. 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.040
 but this reaction loads to call you 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.329
 They are going to start killing others. 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.369
 for this right 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.590
 and for you to find our members you 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.190

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.920

 in a session that has one or more members 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.590
 of your command then exactly this 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.530
 You'll put it sometimes, give it to her. 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:33.440

 with limited vacancies and the thousand 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.790
 we are always giving 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.800
 wiped out exactly who is not 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.720
 playing at our command because you do not play 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.709
 in our command that is active by 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.209
 another command 

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.489
 We take it so that we can 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:54.440
 accepting new members is how many 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:56.660
 members including you who are 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.900
 Watching now watching this video. 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.459
 this introductory video is exactly 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.860
 We had to get someone to 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.450
 Then accept that you know 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.870
 Suddenly you're in charge, the people 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.310
 end up having to remove 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.860
 no longer want in our command also 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.019
 You can go out, I'd rather you leave because 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:16.419
 so it is modest part 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:18.639
 so ok - work also understood the 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.919
 People are free so you can choose 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.970
 between staying in our car at any 

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.650
 other not 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.389
 but we'd rather you stay in 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.270
 that the people you enjoy at 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.449
 and how do we have these vacancies? 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.340
 limited 

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.600
 we keep only the members who 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.000
 play at our command 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.040
 if you suddenly run out of live or 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.080
 you have to travel high breaking the 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.330
 video game, you finally have to 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.610
 no problem, you leave the 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:44.530
 our active command there in heaven club and 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.810
 I do not know how to take care of your life, not you. 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.000
 It can be months, you tell me sometime. 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.710
 Good administrator, I'll stay without playing 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.320
 Because I do not know in the video game 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.960
 fell a lightning burned all that my house 

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.729
 Entirely is on hold, nothing you can 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.850
 not play now what you can not is 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.949
 We always try is to leave pans 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.289
 only the members who are there in our 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:07.360
 command in the other thing is also to leave the 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:09.699
 game tech because if you do not 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.560
 you should also not afraid this is a 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.950
 rule if we are another way of 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.389
 dry and edu but that's it folks these 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.310
 are the basic rules not only of our 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.460
 any other large 

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:23.200
 command as having an administration 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.950
 active they have this rule is not outside the 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.380
 common 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.960
 other important thing guys on the map

 members question of helicopter or airplane 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.460
 they do not get identified they stay 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.500
 with an airplane helicopter icon 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:37.930
 everything even from the tank considers 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.389
 suddenly the command's face 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.610
 tatÃ¡ helicopter you sometimes run out 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:44.590
 killing because you do not know him until 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:46.599
 I even already have one have command members 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.150
 I being the owner already have a member of 

00:05:46.599 --> 00:05:51.550
 command this happens do not pay anything 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:53.770
 show on map this is another one 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.930
 member of our command who actually is 

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:58.599
 My profile of the girl playing now 

00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:02.139
 show you guys he's with the one with 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:03.820
 This little problem here is all in 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.070
 now when it is above the 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:07.750
 georgia is a member of our command but 

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.009
 How is he by helicopter? 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:11.139
 can 

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.069
 and if he does not even see the canopy he is 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:14.289
 getting there 

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.759
 now that he leaves the helicopter is the 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:17.349
 our normal emblem 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:20.860
 It's in these hours that you have to do 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:24.009
 so look at the sea rudge in the lobby 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.509
 of the session and see if the expensive to renato 

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:27.249
 bmx da rbr live 

00:06:25.509 --> 00:06:30.009
 I will not kill so much that it arrived in good 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:31.930
 generally this is also the advise 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:33.969
 you be very careful 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:38.020
 if the guy suddenly killed you what you 

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:39.969
 Do you do nothing to not react and if 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.229
 you can even take a picture because 

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:44.139
 you do not react 

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:46.899
 you will be totally on the reason 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:49.569
 situation understand you did not react 

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:51.879
 you acted right now the guy who killed you 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:55.210
 Face knows it's wrong to understand then 

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:56.589
 Do not do it and do not react. 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:06:58.270
 message to him can send a 

00:06:56.589 --> 00:07:00.729
 message you are at your right 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.499
