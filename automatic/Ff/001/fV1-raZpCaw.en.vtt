 Hello dear friends, you had 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.780
 beech and today will tell you about enough 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.349
 a popular problem on how to solve it 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.089
 this problem is connected and joe breaks 7 and i 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.730
 I think very many with this 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.490
 Personally, I'm sure this problem 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.859
 is that when we 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.550
 install tweak activator it is with us 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.930
 gives here such an error let's 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.930
 adjust the focus 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.890
 gives us such an error is written 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.079
 that the activator cannot function 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.170
 right since we both substrate is not 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.690
 works if you if the device in 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.579
 safe mode, you will see the inscription and 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.079
 xinef can click on it at the top of the screen 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.030
 and select rest stop return to 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.550
 normal mode in general activator is not 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.980
 It works as it does not work here 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.000
 tweak mobile substrate 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.510
 Today I will tell you about how this 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.770
 decide let's start and so 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.410
 accordingly, as you might guess 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.239
 no all of us fmod networks here 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.220
 the top of the screen just does not work this 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.510
 tweak this bowl about this problem i 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:14.369
 I decided to solve this problem 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:18.890
 we must first excuse not first 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:21.740
 we have to go in the sidia let's have a little 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:28.170
 let's even make our 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:32.130
 device so here for this we have to 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:35.880
 go and add the repository now 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:40.860
 I'll show you how to add a repository 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:44.430
 broken apple now I'll show it to you here 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.430
 here is this repository broken apple right here 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.500
 his address I put in the description for 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.689
 video 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.149
 stories about apple repository in general you 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.469
 should ask from the repository I'm in 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:00.509
 description will leave his address you must 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:03.600
 add repository data 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:08.009
 and then in this repository you will have 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:12.110
 such a tweak as let me write it 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.110
 you will have such a mobile 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.730
 substrate trade fix mod let me 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.230
 move on 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:30.870
 like that focusing like mom substrate 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.459
 fix bot here it is this tweak can 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.190
 find in the repository which I showed 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.099
 previously you must install it and in 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.040
 principle after this activator you 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:43.349
 will work great and yet 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.409
 will start works and activator him you 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.859
 things are in principle one of one of 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.480
 major 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:53.190
 tweaks for jailbreak let me get you 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.329
 demonstrate how it works 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.190
 activator on yusi 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.680
 working in principle is wonderful to see 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:02.280
 and this plate does not vylazit and all 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.200
 works so the problem is solved so still 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.629
 the first time you should do it 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.859
 add repository which I will leave 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:13.250
 you in the description of the second you must find 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:16.049
 data 3 km both substrate fix 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.849
 which I showed you install it and 

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:20.190
 in principle, after this activator you 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:21.590
 will earn and you can bet very and 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.879
