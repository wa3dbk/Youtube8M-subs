we'll<00:03:14.560> just<00:03:14.650> have<00:03:14.800> to<00:03:14.950> replicate<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.670> make

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
we'll just have to replicate and make

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.930 
we'll just have to replicate and make
those<00:03:16.150> parts<00:03:16.660> this<00:03:17.590> is<00:03:17.770> not<00:03:18.070> like<00:03:18.430> going<00:03:18.640> down

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
those parts this is not like going down

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.690 
those parts this is not like going down
to<00:03:19.210> the<00:03:19.390> local<00:03:19.630> Honda<00:03:20.500> store<00:03:20.770> and<00:03:20.950> saying<00:03:21.190> dude

service<00:03:35.620> manuals<00:03:36.070> back<00:03:36.640> in<00:03:36.790> the<00:03:36.880> day<00:03:37.030> they

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180 
service manuals back in the day they

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.370 
service manuals back in the day they
would<00:03:37.240> have<00:03:37.420> these<00:03:37.540> things<00:03:37.720> called<00:03:37.870> service

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
would have these things called service

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.740 
would have these things called service
shots<00:03:38.620> where<00:03:39.370> the<00:03:39.580> dealers<00:03:40.000> would<00:03:40.210> send<00:03:40.570> out

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
shots where the dealers would send out

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.230 
shots where the dealers would send out
these<00:03:41.080> on<00:03:41.380> these<00:03:41.800> little<00:03:42.070> like<00:03:42.340> telegrams<00:03:42.970> if

and don't take this the wrong way but

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:49.770 
and don't take this the wrong way but
people<00:03:48.340> who<00:03:48.430> are<00:03:48.490> a<00:03:48.520> lot<00:03:48.700> smarter<00:03:49.240> back<00:03:49.540> then

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
people who are a lot smarter back then

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.320 
people who are a lot smarter back then
there<00:03:49.990> was

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
there was

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.030 
there was
internet<00:03:50.810> surfing<00:03:51.110> or<00:03:51.500> anything<00:03:51.860> like<00:03:51.890> that

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
internet surfing or anything like that

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.370 
internet surfing or anything like that
so<00:03:52.880> there<00:03:53.030> was<00:03:53.150> a<00:03:53.180> lot<00:03:53.450> more<00:03:53.480> mechanical

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
so there was a lot more mechanical

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.190 
so there was a lot more mechanical
technic<00:03:54.740> receipt<00:03:55.250> and<00:03:55.400> a<00:03:55.970> lot<00:03:56.120> more<00:03:56.200> capable

technic receipt and a lot more capable
people<00:03:57.440> back<00:03:58.310> then<00:03:58.610> for<00:03:59.000> basic<00:03:59.540> maintenance

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
people back then for basic maintenance

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.080

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
yeah they would send out like TSB's so

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.390 
yeah they would send out like TSB's so
technical<00:04:05.660> service<00:04:06.020> bulletins<00:04:06.470> but<00:04:07.220> for<00:04:07.370> a

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
technical service bulletins but for a

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.340 
technical service bulletins but for a
cross-country<00:04:07.700> run<00:04:08.120> you<00:04:08.750> really<00:04:09.050> want<00:04:09.230> the

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
cross-country run you really want the

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.300 
cross-country run you really want the
best<00:04:09.590> parts<00:04:09.950> you<00:04:10.070> can<00:04:10.100> get<00:04:11.740> far<00:04:12.740> so<00:04:12.980> the<00:04:13.100> ones

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
best parts you can get far so the ones

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.760 
best parts you can get far so the ones
that<00:04:13.580> you<00:04:13.700> make<00:04:13.850> yourself<00:04:14.270> some<00:04:15.170> of<00:04:15.320> them<00:04:15.470> are
