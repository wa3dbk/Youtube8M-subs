 hydroelectric project cheves 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.420
 Chévez is an energy project that 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.240
 consists of building a 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.729
 passing hydroelectric power station 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.530
 hydroelectric power station will take advantage of 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:32.830
 water strength of rivers 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.170
 huaura and checkbooks which is captured 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.150
 to generate clean electric power and 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.270
 renewable 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.460
 after this process all the water 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.490
 captured will be returned in the same 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:47.680
 physical and chemical conditions to the riverbed 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.220
 from the river 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.210
 Cheves hydroelectric plant located 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:57.150
 Between the towns of Sayán Churín 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:04.380
 will have an installed capacity of 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:07.740
 168 megawatts and 837 gigawatts / hour 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.860
 over the huaura river , a 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.110
 cofferdam to derive the river what 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.890
 allows the construction of the company and 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.890
 take huaura 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.520
 the water collected will be conducted by the 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.880
 transfer tunnel which will have 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:27.610
 an approximate extension of 2.5 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.830
 kilometers from the huaura river to its 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.739
 mouth in the riverbed che 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.720
 crash upstream of the catchment 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:37.900
 chakras 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.180
 in the checkers river has been built a 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.060
 cofferdam to derive the river for 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.120
 construction of catchment works 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.870
 chakras intended to regulate the flow of 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.200
 the rivers and grassi huaura on the trip 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.950
 this work is made up of the dam 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:01.299
 chacras the catchment works the 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:03.909
 desander and the loading chamber 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:07.269
 driving tunnel whose length is 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:09.840
 9.8 kilometers is being excavated from 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:13.319
 three fronts 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:16.470
 on the front farms from the window 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:18.900
 one towards chacras from window one 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.660
 towards the machine house and from the 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:26.120
 front machine house 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.700
 Likewise, in 2012, a 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.340
 window to one of eight hundred ninety and 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.650
 two meters that is used for the excavation 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.010
 from the tunnel of driving to checkbooks 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:40.159
 and towards the machine house 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:43.099
 in 2012 the excavation of the 

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:46.400
 machine house and has already installed the 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:48.640
 crane bridge that represents a 25 by 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:52.400
 cent of the construction of it 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.019
 building where will be generated 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.470
 the energy for the central 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.470
 hydroelectric 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.120
 the waters used in the house of 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:06.170
 machines will be returned to the river Huaura 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:08.780
 through the 3.25 km discharge tunnel 

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:12.630
 which is being dug for two 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.170
 fronts from the access tunnel 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.840
 and the exit continues with the 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:22.980
 mechanical electrical equipment design 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.870
 and hydromechanics those who are at 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.000
 wait for its assembly 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.280
 progress is being made in civil works 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.419
 of the towers of the transmission line 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:37.720
 220 kilovolts and have already been made 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.940
 the assembly of several towers that will carry 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:43.030
 the energy produced in the plant 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:46.110
 hydroelectric power station to the sub 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.880
 huacho station 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:53.170
 regarding the transmission line of 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.330
 average attention of 13.8 kilovolts that 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:59.290
 will supply energy to the dams 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.410
 huaura chakras and said that they have 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:04.600
 started the topographic works for 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:07.240
 develop construction designs 

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.360
 and the construction of roads 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.360
 access 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:14.930
 the construction work of the plant 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:18.800
 hydroelectric plant is still underway 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:21.130
 with high standards in its engineering in 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.870
 the work of social responsibility 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.870
 safety and care of the environment 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.930
 as part of the work in 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.120
 social responsibility in projects 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:37.550
 cheves has a program of 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.759
 local development and a program of 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:43.340
 coexistence in this way the project 

00:05:40.759 --> 00:05:45.770
 seeks to generate value in communities 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.050
 from its area of direct influence to 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.509
 through various productive projects 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.810
 that involve training and assistance 

00:05:50.509 --> 00:05:56.330
 technique for the villagers looking for 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:06:00.210
 generate a positive impact on your 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:03.410
 quality of life in a sustainable way 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:07.319
 On the other hand, the program of coexistence 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:10.080
 seeks to create bonds of trust and good 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:14.360
 relations with the communities of the area 

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.360
 of direct influence of the project 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:23.840
 this is the way we work in sn 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:26.930
 power project cheves betting on the 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:29.540
 commitment of our people and being 

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:33.470
 consistent with our values and 

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:35.960
 business principles the same as we 

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:39.410
 continue to motivate them to be leaders in 

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:42.200
 hydroelectric generation by applying the 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:46.610
 best business management practices 

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:49.000
 and contributing to sustainable development 

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.000
 from the country
