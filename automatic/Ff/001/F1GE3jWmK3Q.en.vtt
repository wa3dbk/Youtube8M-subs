00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
my code because of what I stand for but

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.360 
my code because of what I stand for but
there's<00:03:11.810> another<00:03:12.049> reason<00:03:12.140> -<00:03:12.560> and<00:03:12.769> it's<00:03:13.040> this

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
there's another reason - and it's this

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.400 
there's another reason - and it's this
city<00:03:13.670> I<00:03:13.760> truly<00:03:14.239> believe<00:03:14.480> that<00:03:14.510> if<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.900> did<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:15.260> if

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
city I truly believe that if I did it if

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.259 
city I truly believe that if I did it if
I<00:03:15.530> kill<00:03:15.799> Joker<00:03:16.069> Gotham<00:03:16.640> would<00:03:16.730> just<00:03:16.940> send<00:03:17.120> me

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
I kill Joker Gotham would just send me

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.420 
I kill Joker Gotham would just send me
someone<00:03:17.690> worse<00:03:17.870> maybe<00:03:18.500> even<00:03:18.860> send<00:03:19.099> him<00:03:19.250> back

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
someone worse maybe even send him back

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.250 
someone worse maybe even send him back
but<00:03:19.700> worse<00:03:19.940> than<00:03:20.180> before<00:03:20.510> so<00:03:20.840> Bruce<00:03:21.079> is

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:21.260 
but worse than before so Bruce is

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.720 
but worse than before so Bruce is
flat-out<00:03:21.560> saying<00:03:21.980> he<00:03:22.160> doesn't<00:03:22.370> kill<00:03:22.609> the

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:22.730 
flat-out saying he doesn't kill the

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.280 
flat-out saying he doesn't kill the
Joker<00:03:22.880> because<00:03:23.269> of<00:03:23.389> what<00:03:23.510> he<00:03:23.569> stands<00:03:23.840> for<00:03:24.079> but

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
Joker because of what he stands for but

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.500 
Joker because of what he stands for but
also<00:03:24.500> because<00:03:25.280> he<00:03:25.430> thinks<00:03:25.609> Gotham<00:03:26.120> would<00:03:26.269> send

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:26.510 
also because he thinks Gotham would send

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.180 
also because he thinks Gotham would send
him<00:03:26.660> someone<00:03:26.989> worse<00:03:27.170> or<00:03:27.380> even<00:03:27.650> send<00:03:27.859> the<00:03:27.920> Joker

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
him someone worse or even send the Joker

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.890 
him someone worse or even send the Joker
back<00:03:28.459> but<00:03:28.670> worse<00:03:28.850> than<00:03:28.880> ever<00:03:29.209> I<00:03:29.359> just<00:03:29.600> really

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
back but worse than ever I just really

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.420 
back but worse than ever I just really
like<00:03:30.019> the<00:03:30.109> psychology<00:03:30.620> of<00:03:30.739> Gotham<00:03:31.130> itself

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
like the psychology of Gotham itself

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.099 
like the psychology of Gotham itself
being<00:03:31.639> the<00:03:31.760> reason<00:03:32.060> why<00:03:32.180> Batman<00:03:32.660> won't<00:03:32.840> kill

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
being the reason why Batman won't kill

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:34.720 
being the reason why Batman won't kill
the<00:03:33.230> Joker<00:03:33.380> but<00:03:33.739> yes<00:03:33.950> I<00:03:34.099> hope<00:03:34.190> this<00:03:34.370> answered
