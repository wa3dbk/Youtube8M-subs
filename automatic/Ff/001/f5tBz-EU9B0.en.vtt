hey guys so we're going to race together
with<00:00:10.950> you<00:00:11.099> guys<00:00:11.130> as<00:00:11.519> well<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.940> so<00:00:12.389> of<00:00:12.480> course

with you guys as well and so of course
first<00:00:12.929> we<00:00:13.170> have<00:00:13.349> to<00:00:13.530> scramble<00:00:13.799> our<00:00:14.009> cubes<00:00:14.309> so

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
first we have to scramble our cubes so

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.099 
first we have to scramble our cubes so
we're<00:00:15.150> going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.360> scramble<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.780> cubes<00:00:16.020> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
we're going to scramble the cubes the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:17.330 
we're going to scramble the cubes the
same<00:00:16.289> way<00:00:16.440> we're<00:00:16.590> gonna<00:00:16.680> put<00:00:16.830> the<00:00:16.920> green<00:00:17.100> face

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
same way we're gonna put the green face

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.460 
same way we're gonna put the green face
facing<00:00:17.760> ourselves<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.600> white<00:00:18.750> face<00:00:18.990> facing

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
facing ourselves the white face facing

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.689 
facing ourselves the white face facing
up<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:19.680> we're<00:00:19.859> going<00:00:19.980> to<00:00:20.010> do<00:00:20.189> this<00:00:20.400> algorithm

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
up and we're going to do this algorithm

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.179 
up and we're going to do this algorithm
so<00:00:21.270> here's<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> algorithm<00:00:21.840> it's<00:00:22.230> down<00:00:22.859> -

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
so here's the algorithm it's down -

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.839 
so here's the algorithm it's down -
right<00:00:24.090> -<00:00:24.390> back<00:00:25.260> inverted<00:00:25.800> down<00:00:26.550> -<00:00:26.880> up<00:00:27.240> -<00:00:27.990> back

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
right - back inverted down - up - back

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.190 
right - back inverted down - up - back
left<00:00:29.849> -<00:00:30.119> front<00:00:30.960> inverted<00:00:31.380> up<00:00:31.980> -<00:00:32.460> left<00:00:33.180> -<00:00:33.480> front

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
left - front inverted up - left - front

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.720 
left - front inverted up - left - front
-<00:00:34.469> down<00:00:35.250> right<00:00:36.120> up<00:00:36.780> front<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.710> verted<00:00:38.070> up<00:00:38.309> -

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
- down right up front and verted up -

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.400 
- down right up front and verted up -
back<00:00:39.450> right<00:00:40.230> down<00:00:41.100> -<00:00:41.399> left<00:00:42.059> -<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.540> up<00:00:42.960> so<00:00:43.290> we

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
back right down - left - and up so we

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:44.420 
back right down - left - and up so we
don't<00:00:43.440> want<00:00:43.649> to<00:00:43.710> look<00:00:43.770> at<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:43.950> cube<00:00:44.129> but<00:00:44.250> let's

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
don't want to look at the cube but let's

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.650 
don't want to look at the cube but let's
take<00:00:44.640> a<00:00:44.670> look<00:00:44.879> at<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.030> front<00:00:45.180> face<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.570> make

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
take a look at the front face to make

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.240 
take a look at the front face to make
sure<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.960> all<00:00:46.110> have<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.440> same<00:00:46.590> scramble<00:00:47.100> and

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
sure we all have the same scramble and

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.209 
sure we all have the same scramble and
what<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.450> on<00:00:48.719> my<00:00:48.750> left<00:00:49.260> two<00:00:49.530> corners<00:00:50.010> I

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
what I have on my left two corners I

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.760 
what I have on my left two corners I
have<00:00:50.640> red<00:00:50.879> on<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.239> left<00:00:51.420> two<00:00:51.660> corners<00:00:52.590> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
have red on the left two corners and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.470 
have red on the left two corners and
then<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.070> have<00:00:53.370> on<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.969> top<00:00:54.210> right<00:00:54.449> corner

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
then I have on the top right corner

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.660 
then I have on the top right corner
green<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.320> bottom<00:00:55.590> right<00:00:55.800> corner<00:00:55.829> orange

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
green the bottom right corner orange

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.540 
green the bottom right corner orange
then<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.570> top<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.109> left<00:00:58.440> edges<00:00:58.710> are<00:00:59.309> white

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
then the top and left edges are white

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.729 
then the top and left edges are white
and<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.000> bottom<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.480> right<00:01:00.899> edges<00:01:01.170> are<00:01:01.530> blue

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
and the bottom and right edges are blue

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.640 
and the bottom and right edges are blue
is<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.250> what<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.460> have<00:01:02.870> yep<00:01:03.899> alright<00:01:04.409> I'm

all set so we're all set so I'm going to
give<00:01:06.630> us<00:01:06.750> 15<00:01:07.229> seconds<00:01:07.619> of<00:01:07.710> inspection<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
give us 15 seconds of inspection and

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.420 
give us 15 seconds of inspection and
we're<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.930> solve<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.140> cube<00:01:10.320> so<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.979> your

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
we're going to solve the cube so on your

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.690 
we're going to solve the cube so on your
mark<00:01:11.610> get<00:01:11.850> set<00:01:12.470> inspect<00:01:13.470> all<00:01:14.189> right<00:01:14.430> here<00:01:14.610> we

cubing in that that time period well um

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.620 
cubing in that that time period well um
I<00:02:38.170> I<00:02:38.230> started<00:02:38.890> speed<00:02:39.160> cubing<00:02:39.519> in<00:02:39.670> May<00:02:39.820> 2013

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
I I started speed cubing in May 2013

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.319 
I I started speed cubing in May 2013
I<00:02:40.780> actually<00:02:41.230> solved<00:02:41.860> the<00:02:41.980> cube<00:02:42.250> like<00:02:42.670> one<00:02:43.060> time

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:43.329

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
like one thing I like about cubing is

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:45.450 
like one thing I like about cubing is
that<00:03:43.570> I<00:03:43.810> feel<00:03:44.200> like<00:03:44.350> every<00:03:44.710> time<00:03:44.950> you<00:03:45.070> solve<00:03:45.280> it

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.460 
that I feel like every time you solve it

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.250 
that I feel like every time you solve it
it's<00:03:45.580> different<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.090> I<00:03:46.480> think<00:03:46.690> that<00:03:46.960> that's

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 
it's different and I think that that's

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:48.930 
it's different and I think that that's
what's<00:03:47.500> really<00:03:47.710> fun<00:03:47.860> and<00:03:48.010> no<00:03:48.100> matter<00:03:48.250> how<00:03:48.490> it's

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
what's really fun and no matter how it's

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.490 
what's really fun and no matter how it's
