 If you cast this spell near a wall set up by the enemy for a short cut, you can 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:48.640
 You can jump straight ahead and create a shortcut 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.640
 So friendly units can advance as if not something wall there 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.329

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.240

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.770
 Even if you say something like this, it has been verified 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.780
 It was verified because I did not check it 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.900

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:36.170

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:53.540
 Finally I do not want to go doing it a goal to say Rutte is knocked down to the fine 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.590
 You start 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.409
 Jump 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.360

 Let's also check the jumping character and backstroke 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.350
