00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:13.350 
for this series and then upload them
like<00:04:08.470> hopefully<00:04:10.480> every<00:04:11.480> day<00:04:11.660> this<00:04:12.170> week<00:04:12.230> I

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
like hopefully every day this week I

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.220 
like hopefully every day this week I
think<00:04:14.360> that's<00:04:14.540> been<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.780> bit<00:04:14.959> too<00:04:15.110> ambitious

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
think that's been a bit too ambitious

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.900 
think that's been a bit too ambitious
for<00:04:15.620> me<00:04:15.860> because<00:04:16.220> my<00:04:16.489> internet<00:04:17.239> and<00:04:17.510> I<00:04:18.760> most<00:04:19.760> of

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
for me because my internet and I most of

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:21.370 
for me because my internet and I most of
you<00:04:20.000> guys<00:04:20.030> might<00:04:20.390> know<00:04:20.570> I've<00:04:20.810> got<00:04:21.020> a<00:04:21.049> training

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:21.380 
you guys might know I've got a training

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.990 
you guys might know I've got a training
course<00:04:21.560> so<00:04:21.830> you<00:04:23.140> know<00:04:24.140> but<00:04:24.760> hopefully<00:04:25.760> I<00:04:25.790> can

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
course so you know but hopefully I can

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.420 
course so you know but hopefully I can
get<00:04:26.480> 1i<00:04:26.660> every<00:04:27.170> weakness<00:04:27.530> or<00:04:27.740> every<00:04:28.130> week<00:04:28.250> this

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
get 1i every weakness or every week this

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.160 
get 1i every weakness or every week this
week<00:04:28.640> made<00:04:29.000> no<00:04:29.120> sense<00:04:29.300> every<00:04:29.780> day<00:04:29.930> this<00:04:30.110> week

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
week made no sense every day this week

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:34.860 
week made no sense every day this week
and<00:04:32.530> hopefully<00:04:33.530> you<00:04:33.680> guys<00:04:33.830> will<00:04:34.070> enjoy<00:04:34.100> up

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.650 
and hopefully you guys will enjoy up
I've<00:04:35.890> been<00:04:36.890> messing<00:04:37.310> about<00:04:37.580> with<00:04:37.640> the

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
I've been messing about with the

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.220 
I've been messing about with the
volume<00:04:40.500> of<00:04:40.710> my<00:04:40.890> commentary<00:04:41.430> I've<00:04:41.930> like<00:04:42.930> in<00:04:43.080> my

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230 
volume of my commentary I've like in my

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.020 
volume of my commentary I've like in my
first<00:04:43.440> videos<00:04:43.860> and<00:04:44.160> up<00:04:44.310> until<00:04:44.490> this<00:04:44.790> one<00:04:45.000> I

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
first videos and up until this one I

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.250 
first videos and up until this one I
think<00:04:45.210> they've<00:04:45.780> all<00:04:45.930> been<00:04:46.110> quite<00:04:46.350> quiet<00:04:46.940> so

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
think they've all been quite quiet so

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.260 
think they've all been quite quiet so
hopefully<00:04:49.260> in<00:04:49.710> this<00:04:49.950> one<00:04:50.190> it<00:04:50.400> is<00:04:50.940> lighter

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
hopefully in this one it is lighter

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:52.790 
hopefully in this one it is lighter
because<00:04:51.570> I've<00:04:51.870> been<00:04:52.020> messing<00:04:52.170> about<00:04:52.470> with<00:04:52.530> it

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:52.800 
because I've been messing about with it

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:55.670 
because I've been messing about with it
you<00:04:52.950> know<00:04:52.980> trying<00:04:53.340> to<00:04:53.370> get<00:04:53.550> it<00:04:53.670> lighter<00:04:54.680> make

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
you know trying to get it lighter make

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.400 
you know trying to get it lighter make
it<00:04:55.830> all<00:04:55.980> lighter<00:04:56.490> than<00:04:56.730> the<00:04:56.850> game<00:04:57.030> and

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
it all lighter than the game and

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:01.340 
it all lighter than the game and
hopefully<00:04:58.410> it<00:04:58.680> is<00:04:58.770> good<00:04:59.600> let<00:05:00.600> me<00:05:00.720> know<00:05:00.900> what
