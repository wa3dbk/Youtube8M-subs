Luigi's Mansion review on YouTube as
well<00:01:16.540> the<00:01:17.540> graphics<00:01:17.750> for<00:01:18.140> this<00:01:18.290> game<00:01:18.410> I<00:01:18.560> would

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
well the graphics for this game I would

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.290 
well the graphics for this game I would
definitely<00:01:19.250> say<00:01:19.370> are<00:01:19.490> top-notch<00:01:19.910> not<00:01:20.180> the

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
definitely say are top-notch not the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.000 
definitely say are top-notch not the
absolute<00:01:20.840> best<00:01:20.990> I've<00:01:21.200> seen<00:01:21.230> on<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.590> system<00:01:21.920> I

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
absolute best I've seen on the system I

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.900 
absolute best I've seen on the system I
think<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.310> Resident<00:01:22.670> Evil<00:01:22.880> Revelations

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
think the Resident Evil Revelations

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.050 
think the Resident Evil Revelations
probably<00:01:23.840> tops<00:01:24.050> it<00:01:24.320> but<00:01:24.530> as<00:01:25.490> far<00:01:25.790> as<00:01:25.880> getting

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
probably tops it but as far as getting

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.340 
probably tops it but as far as getting
the<00:01:26.180> most<00:01:26.390> they<00:01:26.510> can<00:01:26.570> get<00:01:26.720> out<00:01:26.810> of<00:01:26.900> the<00:01:26.990> system

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
the most they can get out of the system

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.020 
the most they can get out of the system
and<00:01:27.530> tendo<00:01:27.800> does<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:27.980> great<00:01:28.190> job<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.730> looks<00:01:28.880> just

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
and tendo does a great job it looks just

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.490 
and tendo does a great job it looks just
as<00:01:29.150> good<00:01:29.330> as<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.510> PlayStation<00:01:29.720> 2<00:01:30.080> original

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
as good as the PlayStation 2 original

system I did have a little bit of
difficulty<00:01:44.750> with<00:01:44.930> the<00:01:45.140> game<00:01:45.290> myself<00:01:45.500> as<00:01:46.010> far

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
difficulty with the game myself as far

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:47.740 
difficulty with the game myself as far
as<00:01:46.280> getting<00:01:46.580> spotted<00:01:46.820> by<00:01:47.060> guards<00:01:47.480> all<00:01:47.630> the

as getting spotted by guards all the

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.180 
as getting spotted by guards all the
time<00:01:47.930> I<00:01:47.960> couldn't<00:01:48.260> shake<00:01:48.560> them

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
time I couldn't shake them

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
no matter what I did it seemed like if I

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.610 
no matter what I did it seemed like if I
had<00:01:53.390> one<00:01:53.420> complaint<00:01:53.690> about<00:01:54.020> the<00:01:54.260> game<00:01:54.410> it's

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
that it's that some games just don't

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.750 
that it's that some games just don't
seem<00:01:57.500> to<00:01:57.590> transition<00:01:58.130> well<00:01:58.340> to<00:01:58.430> the<00:01:58.520> small
