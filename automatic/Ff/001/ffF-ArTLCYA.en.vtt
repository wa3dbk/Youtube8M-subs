00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.620
 my 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.259
 she greets the announced the nights I hope 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:21.939
 that you're fine it's with a 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:24.279
 immense pleasure that I give you 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.200
 today a little excluded they get 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:26.950
 find on the map came on the 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.439
 planet venus 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:31.570
 so this is an area is currently 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.040
 inaccessible this turn at a level 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.620
 portal that some of you have 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.690
 can already be seen and well know that my 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.210
 friend thousands of Americans have found a 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.460
 way to cross this portal which is 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.980
 other than a gravitational elevator 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.860
 and takes you on a damask tablecloth 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.149
 terminus it will be accessible the order of 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.280
 excellent but you want it 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:53.530
 will be released in 2015 so it's good 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.519
 obviously show us how to access 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.960
 to this tablecloth 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.329
 so here is a first time you me 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.929
 see the road to go to the 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:00.429
 citadel 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:02.679
 so this is the place where the 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.120
 portal in question then when you 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:06.820
 will arrive at the foot of the citadel 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.490
 know that it attach a package of bex 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:11.050
 1st pi2 minotaur and I invite you to 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.490
 do a little bit of household history 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.590
 to be quieter because who 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.390
 waiting for you it's a jump course 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.549
 of obstacles that will take you about 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.010
 an hour if however you are too 

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.390
 talented points so there you just have to 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.280
 pass the first named when it is 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.520
 no need to kill them when one 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.289
 happened down the north mechanics 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.600
 the junction from September 6th 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:32.729
 precisely you will be able to start 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.860
 to demand more flexible and then if you 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:37.710
 accounts on the area so as to be able 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.640
 join the portal the most 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.409
 quiet possible 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.479
 know that for this little mission 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.740
 you can be accompanied by two 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.380
 players since this is the mode 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.429
 exploration on the map came and I 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.530
 strongly advise you to be 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.840
 accompanied what will make things a 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.030
 little bit more fun so when you 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.149
 are at the foot of this portal 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.340
 they perceive for left moore and 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.079
 that's where the hardest starts 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.420
 the little course you have a 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:04.799
 kind of relief everywhere on the walls of 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.530
 left he'll have to join this 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.630
 first point to the first set first 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.610
 little flambe to you are going to have bunker 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.500
 and until this little bar is the 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.090
 harder it's now he's going 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.010
 have people of this second 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.260
 tiny bar that is a little bit 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.120
 in height it changes about 2 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.579
 justin bieber is so to my little 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.440
 advice is to move forward while jumping 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.069
 story of not wearing the wall 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.769
 invisible 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.329
 the second most difficult stage 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.950
 is going to be joining his platform that 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:34.139
 is right above your head 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.090
 and here my advice to join this 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:38.940
 platform is to back down slightly 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.500
 your character while jumping in order to 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.450
 able to reach it to be now 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.310
 free to be able to throw you body and soul 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.739
 in this gravitational lift in 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.630
 taking care to jump well above 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.209
 the ring and there you will see you show 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.739
 and be accomplices and to the authors up 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.500
 the famous maps I'm talking about 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.480
 from the beginning the map to finish so 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.859
 we are on a map of the planet 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.349
 Venus we find well the 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:02.910
 features and vex with rocks 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:05.700
 everywhere lights a little 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:08.370
 everywhere so we're on a map of 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.859
 Venus it's called the terminus so 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:13.109
 some say it will be an assault of 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:14.609
 level 22 it will reach a point 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:16.769
 final on which I am currently 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:18.540
 thus giving me this point 

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.470
 final it's kind of a dome a kind 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.019
 Portal 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.090
 so I think that will be the point of 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.859
 fall of this assault in any case know 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.630
 that there is in close proximity to this 

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.370
 place two specters so I'm fine 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.470
 obviously give you the 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.610
 maps 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:33.350
 so when you are at this level 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.330
 portal you will see it's a little bit 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.550
 way and there you have a first rock 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.860
 a first mound him do not you go 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.840
 climb on it and just you 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.740
 will have two columns one left here and 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.660
 one on the right 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.750
 so when you're on this mound 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.250
 does not already ignored the skin the coat of 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.500
 evidence since it is useless gold 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.630
 us if you want of course for the 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.030
 bubble mirande and there you go up 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.460
 on a left mound you eat 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.110
 this little wall on your right you 

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:02.480
 always eat on the right 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:05.090
 and there you will see the spectrum 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.160
 behind poland on the small ledge 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.380
 so know when you activate the 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.570
 spectra of this map of the terminus so 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:13.520
 you will have an 8 month card where 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:15.680
 we do not have more information for the 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.269
 moment i 'm going to show you the way 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.549
 from my point of view because it is 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:21.320
 accessible and visible from this point of 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:22.910
 view so you have the portal that is 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.800
 the gravitational lift you go 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.260
 take on your right and take this 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:30.140
 little way up this column for 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.910
 access this spectrum the second spectrum 

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:33.620
 meanwhile it is even easier to 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.390
 find since it is on the zone 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.790
 of spawn near the elevator 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.620
 gravitational so you advance you 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.169
 have a first mound right in front 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.970
 of you and well the text here is hidden 

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.729
 in a small hole it's really very 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.780
 very simple so that's all for 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.460
 these two facts 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.140
 I do not know if there are more 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:52.970
 Anyway we do not have the knowledge 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.310
 I did not hear about it 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.140
 internet and i did not find my little 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.340
 advice if you ever want to leave 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.260
 this area well you just have 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:02.780
 to go to orbit because 

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:05.000
 when you throw yourself into the south 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.740
 and well you go to shoot at sight or maps 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.580
 and that will not make you die 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.470
 leave the area 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.180
 if however you find a way to 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.550
 die in this area you go a 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:15.110
 repop with him we see there the only way 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.400
 to acquit it is simply 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.169
 return to orbit 

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.550
 I hope this little video you 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:21.140
 please do not hesitate to leave me a 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.360
 little comment below the video 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.960
 or give me your hot prints is 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.910
 also shared you 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.430
 directly from our twitter account 

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:31.229
 here I am making you kiss standards to 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.880
 very quickly for small information 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:36.440
 that I had bet on you too much 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.440
 next bmc not the same
