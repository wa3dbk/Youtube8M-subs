see<00:00:00.210> the<00:00:02.480> esophagus<00:00:03.480> right<00:00:03.659> behind<00:00:03.959> it<00:00:04.170> here

00:00:04.579 --> 00:00:04.589 
see the esophagus right behind it here

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:07.760 
see the esophagus right behind it here
this<00:00:05.100> large<00:00:05.490> strand<00:00:06.060> here<00:00:06.480> is<00:00:07.170> actually<00:00:07.649> the

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
this large strand here is actually the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.459 
this large strand here is actually the
vagus<00:00:08.069> nerve<00:00:08.220> which<00:00:08.250> has<00:00:08.670> been<00:00:08.820> cut<00:00:09.090> and<00:00:09.469> all

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
vagus nerve which has been cut and all

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.520 
vagus nerve which has been cut and all
of<00:00:10.740> the<00:00:10.950> major<00:00:11.670> vessels<00:00:12.139> that<00:00:13.139> we're<00:00:13.290> still

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
of the major vessels that we're still

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.709 
of the major vessels that we're still
intact<00:00:13.889> in<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.219> around<00:00:14.580> the<00:00:14.730> heart<00:00:14.969> have<00:00:15.540> been

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
intact in the around the heart have been

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.450 
intact in the around the heart have been
cut<00:00:15.990> in<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.260> specimen<00:00:16.650> now<00:00:16.890> this<00:00:17.100> is<00:00:17.250> what<00:00:17.369> we

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
cut in this specimen now this is what we

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.019 
cut in this specimen now this is what we
did<00:00:17.609> last<00:00:17.760> term<00:00:18.180> so<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.710> know<00:00:19.830> basically<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
did last term so you know basically the

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.759 
did last term so you know basically the
last<00:00:21.240> one<00:00:21.449> I<00:00:21.480> cut<00:00:21.689> was<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:21.960> one<00:00:22.170> which<00:00:22.350> is<00:00:22.380> the

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
last one I cut was this one which is the

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.300 
last one I cut was this one which is the
aorta<00:00:23.670> going<00:00:24.330> around<00:00:24.539> the<00:00:24.660> back<00:00:24.810> and<00:00:25.140> so

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:25.310 
aorta going around the back and so

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.120 
aorta going around the back and so
basically<00:00:26.310> if<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:26.939> follow<00:00:27.240> this<00:00:27.420> down<00:00:28.130> I'll

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
basically if we follow this down I'll

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:44.450 
basically if we follow this down I'll
try<00:00:41.540> because<00:00:42.540> what<00:00:43.500> yeah<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.980> you<00:00:44.340> know<00:00:44.430> I

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
try because what yeah I you know I

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.979 
try because what yeah I you know I
didn't<00:00:44.789> want<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> take<00:00:45.180> everything<00:00:45.660> out<00:00:45.750> least

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
didn't want to take everything out least

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.979 
didn't want to take everything out least
not<00:00:46.200> right<00:00:46.379> away<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.600> basically<00:00:48.600> here's

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
not right away so basically here's

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.830 
not right away so basically here's
here's<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.039> trachea<00:00:50.550> fairly<00:00:50.940> substantial

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
here's a trachea fairly substantial

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.869 
here's a trachea fairly substantial
structure<00:00:52.289> here<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.710> throat<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.399> it

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
structure here in the throat and it

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.970 
structure here in the throat and it
narrows<00:00:54.300> out<00:00:54.480> when<00:00:54.989> you<00:00:55.079> get<00:00:55.230> down<00:00:55.379> into<00:00:55.710> this

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
narrows out when you get down into this

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.549 
narrows out when you get down into this
region<00:00:56.370> and<00:00:56.610> actually<00:00:57.600> when<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.230> get<00:00:58.350> down

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
region and actually when you get down

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.920 
region and actually when you get down
around<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.219> lungs<00:00:59.430> you<00:01:00.300> see<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.690> it

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
around the lungs you see that it

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.270 
around the lungs you see that it
branches<00:01:01.500> out<00:01:01.739> into<00:01:02.210> several<00:01:03.210> things<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.629> here

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
branches out into several things so here

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.440 
branches out into several things so here
where<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.309> put<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.700> probe<00:01:05.939> and<00:01:06.180> you're

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
where I put the probe and you're

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.120 
where I put the probe and you're
standing<00:01:06.780> right<00:01:06.810> over<00:01:07.409> my<00:01:07.590> head<00:01:07.799> you'll<00:01:08.010> be

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
standing right over my head you'll be

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.620 
standing right over my head you'll be
able<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.340> see<00:01:08.460> right<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.790> here<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.150> there's

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
able to see right in here that there's

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.719 
able to see right in here that there's
two<00:01:09.900> major<00:01:10.170> divisions<00:01:10.619> one<00:01:11.130> that<00:01:11.310> goes<00:01:11.520> on

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
two major divisions one that goes on

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.520 
two major divisions one that goes on
this<00:01:11.850> side<00:01:11.909> and<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.780> other<00:01:12.810> one<00:01:13.080> goes<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.409> the

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
this side and the other one goes on the

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.039 
this side and the other one goes on the
other<00:01:13.680> side<00:01:16.340> can<00:01:17.340> you<00:01:17.400> see<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.759> so<00:01:18.030> if<00:01:18.750> you're

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
other side can you see that so if you're

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.830 
other side can you see that so if you're
looking<00:01:19.409> at<00:01:19.530> it<00:01:19.650> from<00:01:19.850> the<00:01:20.850> from<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.450> superior

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
looking at it from the from the superior

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.350 
looking at it from the from the superior
side<00:01:22.049> down<00:01:22.320> you<00:01:22.950> can<00:01:23.100> see<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.430> major<00:01:23.729> this<00:01:24.210> is

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
side down you can see this major this is

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.520 
side down you can see this major this is
a<00:01:24.390> subdivision<00:01:24.840> here

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
a subdivision here

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.420 
a subdivision here
the<00:01:25.860> other<00:01:26.040> ones<00:01:26.250> right<00:01:26.460> over<00:01:26.700> there<00:01:28.220> okay<00:01:29.220> and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
the other ones right over there okay and

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.330 
the other ones right over there okay and
so<00:01:29.880> ya<00:01:30.299> know<00:01:30.570> if<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:30.869> can<00:01:31.020> say<00:01:31.650> you<00:01:31.710> know<00:01:32.250> I

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
so ya know if you can say you know I

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.580 
so ya know if you can say you know I
don't<00:01:32.640> wanna<00:01:32.759> rip<00:01:32.909> the<00:01:33.060> lung<00:01:33.240> off<00:01:35.240> yeah<00:01:36.240> so<00:01:37.170> so

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
don't wanna rip the lung off yeah so so

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.170 
don't wanna rip the lung off yeah so so
you<00:01:37.650> can<00:01:37.829> see<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.310> see<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.640> smoke<00:01:38.939> quite

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
you can see if you see that smoke quite

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.179 
you can see if you see that smoke quite
smaller<00:01:39.540> where<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.259> know<00:01:40.409> even<00:01:40.770> if<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.950> can't

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
smaller where you know even if you can't

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.889 
smaller where you know even if you can't
see<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.430> whole<00:01:41.579> thing<00:01:41.820> it's<00:01:42.360> narrowed<00:01:42.780> out

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
see the whole thing it's narrowed out

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.080 
see the whole thing it's narrowed out
considerably<00:01:43.470> from<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.880> is<00:01:45.060> a

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
considerably from here so this is a

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.149 
considerably from here so this is a
branch<00:01:45.420> it's<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.899> into<00:01:46.170> this<00:01:46.290> first

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
branch it's going into this first

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.190 
branch it's going into this first
segment<00:01:47.460> right<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.939> here<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.390> that's<00:01:48.930> what's

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
segment right in here and that's what's

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.480 
segment right in here and that's what's
going<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.439> happen<00:01:49.799> is<00:01:49.950> these<00:01:50.130> are<00:01:50.310> going<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
going to happen is these are going to

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.510 
going to happen is these are going to
peel<00:01:50.700> off<00:01:50.909> one<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:52.170> know<00:01:52.320> what's<00:01:53.220> called<00:01:53.460> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
peel off one you know what's called a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.310 
peel off one you know what's called a
primary<00:01:53.759> bronchus<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.540> comes<00:01:55.020> off<00:01:55.170> the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
primary bronchus it comes off the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.530 
primary bronchus it comes off the
primary<00:01:55.530> stem<00:01:55.979> each<00:01:56.490> one's<00:01:56.850> going<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.090> go<00:01:57.240> into

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
primary stem each one's going to go into

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.569 
primary stem each one's going to go into
a<00:01:57.570> lobe<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.049> lung<00:01:58.259> as<00:01:58.799> soon<00:01:59.130> as<00:01:59.280> it<00:01:59.430> gets

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
a lobe of the lung as soon as it gets

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.580 
a lobe of the lung as soon as it gets
into<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> lobe<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.390> lung<00:02:00.630> then<00:02:01.380> it's

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
into the lobe of the lung then it's

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.899 
into the lobe of the lung then it's
going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.799> start<00:02:02.100> branching<00:02:02.430> out

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
going to start branching out

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.969 
going to start branching out
you<00:02:03.060> know<00:02:03.200> bifurcating<00:02:04.200> more<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.619> more

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
you know bifurcating more and more

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.940 
you know bifurcating more and more
okay<00:02:05.729> into<00:02:06.539> what<00:02:06.750> allows<00:02:07.289> the<00:02:07.590> lungs<00:02:07.799> to

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
okay into what allows the lungs to

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.949 
okay into what allows the lungs to
inflate<00:02:08.429> kind<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:08.970> what<00:02:09.179> we<00:02:09.300> saw<00:02:09.479> before

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
inflate kind of like what we saw before

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.380 
inflate kind of like what we saw before
okay<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.830> so<00:02:11.400> this<00:02:11.670> is<00:02:11.819> it<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.030> know<00:02:12.239> it's<00:02:12.360> a

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
okay and so this is it you know it's a

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.050 
okay and so this is it you know it's a
pretty<00:02:12.629> simple<00:02:13.230> structure<00:02:13.920> okay<00:02:14.640> when<00:02:14.970> you

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
pretty simple structure okay when you

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.690 
pretty simple structure okay when you
look<00:02:15.209> at<00:02:15.330> that<00:02:15.420> now<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.890> know<00:02:16.980> all<00:02:17.250> the<00:02:17.370> other

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
look at that now you know all the other

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.550 
look at that now you know all the other
structures<00:02:18.150> that<00:02:18.330> were<00:02:18.629> up<00:02:18.780> in<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.440> know

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
structures that were up in the you know

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.170 
structures that were up in the you know
the<00:02:19.590> pharyngeal<00:02:19.980> structures<00:02:20.670> and<00:02:20.879> so<00:02:21.000> on

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
the pharyngeal structures and so on

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.699 
the pharyngeal structures and so on
that's<00:02:21.750> what<00:02:21.989> you're<00:02:22.110> going<00:02:22.200> to<00:02:22.260> look<00:02:22.410> at<00:02:22.530> the

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
that's what you're going to look at the

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:29.449 
that's what you're going to look at the
model<00:02:23.430> for<00:02:23.640> because<00:02:24.269> I'm<00:02:24.569> not<00:02:24.780> gonna<00:02:28.459> not

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:29.459 
model for because I'm not gonna not

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.789 
model for because I'm not gonna not
going<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.670> saw<00:02:29.790> him<00:02:29.910> in<00:02:29.970> half<00:02:33.140> well<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.349> apex

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
going to saw him in half well the apex

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.479 
going to saw him in half well the apex
the<00:02:35.040> base<00:02:35.220> is<00:02:35.459> the<00:02:35.489> bottom<00:02:35.910> apex<00:02:36.629> is<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> top

00:02:37.479 --> 00:02:37.489 
the base is the bottom apex is the top

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.479 
the base is the bottom apex is the top
here's<00:02:38.489> the<00:02:38.610> apex<00:02:39.000> yeah<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.530> so<00:02:40.950> bate<00:02:41.220> well

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
here's the apex yeah so so bate well

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.130 
here's the apex yeah so so bate well
think<00:02:41.760> about<00:02:41.880> it<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.299> apex<00:02:42.660> is<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> point

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
think about it the apex is a point

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.240 
think about it the apex is a point
important<00:02:43.530> right

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
important right

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.789 
important right
so<00:02:44.910> here<00:02:45.390> the<00:02:45.540> here's<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.049> base<00:02:46.230> here's<00:02:46.650> the

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
so here the here's the base here's the

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:49.309 
so here the here's the base here's the
apex<00:02:47.250> here<00:02:47.519> the<00:02:48.000> base<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.420> lungs<00:02:48.599> here<00:02:48.930> again

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
apex here the base of lungs here again

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:52.580 
apex here the base of lungs here again
here's<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.579> diaphragm<00:02:51.060> major<00:02:51.420> muscle<00:02:52.349> of

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
here's the the diaphragm major muscle of

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.819 
here's the the diaphragm major muscle of
respiration<00:02:53.090> okay<00:02:54.090> and<00:02:54.420> so<00:02:55.140> you<00:02:55.590> know<00:02:55.680> when

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:55.829 
respiration okay and so you know when

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:56.930 
respiration okay and so you know when
you<00:02:55.920> think<00:02:56.099> about<00:02:56.160> this<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> pretty

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
you think about this is a pretty

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.199 
you think about this is a pretty
straightforward<00:02:57.799> dissection<00:02:59.180> eventually<00:03:00.180> I

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
straightforward dissection eventually I

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.690 
straightforward dissection eventually I
think<00:03:00.540> what<00:03:00.989> I<00:03:01.019> want<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.319> do<00:03:01.440> is<00:03:01.590> first<00:03:01.860> get<00:03:02.310> the

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
think what I want to do is first get the

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:03.949 
think what I want to do is first get the
other<00:03:02.819> folks<00:03:03.060> to<00:03:03.209> see<00:03:03.329> everything<00:03:03.660> intact

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
other folks to see everything intact

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.350 
other folks to see everything intact
then<00:03:04.860> we'll<00:03:05.099> remove<00:03:05.370> one<00:03:05.760> of<00:03:05.790> the<00:03:05.940> lungs<00:03:06.150> after

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 
then we'll remove one of the lungs after

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.800 
then we'll remove one of the lungs after
everybody<00:03:06.750> see<00:03:06.930> okay<00:03:08.299> any<00:03:09.299> questions<00:03:09.359> about

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
everybody see okay any questions about

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.229 
everybody see okay any questions about
you<00:03:10.590> know<00:03:10.620> as<00:03:11.310> you're<00:03:11.549> looking<00:03:11.730> at<00:03:11.970> stuff

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
you know as you're looking at stuff

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.289 
you know as you're looking at stuff
again<00:03:12.720> I<00:03:12.750> like<00:03:13.530> to<00:03:13.680> say<00:03:13.889> I've<00:03:14.010> cut<00:03:14.310> all<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
again I like to say I've cut all the

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.330 
again I like to say I've cut all the
major<00:03:15.510> blood<00:03:15.989> vessels<00:03:16.410> here<00:03:16.590> so<00:03:16.799> you<00:03:16.889> don't<00:03:17.069> I

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
major blood vessels here so you don't I

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.039 
major blood vessels here so you don't I
mean<00:03:17.639> you're<00:03:17.790> not<00:03:17.910> responsible<00:03:18.569> for<00:03:18.930> those

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
mean you're not responsible for those

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.069 
mean you're not responsible for those
now<00:03:19.290> anyway<00:03:19.799> but<00:03:20.250> notice<00:03:20.760> here<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.780> fact<00:03:21.959> this

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:22.079 
now anyway but notice here the fact this

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.620 
now anyway but notice here the fact this
is<00:03:22.139> kind<00:03:22.470> of<00:03:22.560> a<00:03:22.650> nice<00:03:22.829> as<00:03:23.519> we<00:03:23.760> reflect<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.389> one

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
is kind of a nice as we reflect this one

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.470 
is kind of a nice as we reflect this one
lobe<00:03:25.290> here<00:03:25.709> at<00:03:25.769> the<00:03:25.859> top<00:03:26.069> notice<00:03:27.030> you've<00:03:27.299> got

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
lobe here at the top notice you've got

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.129 
lobe here at the top notice you've got
essentially<00:03:28.200> you've<00:03:29.130> got<00:03:29.540> pulmonary<00:03:30.540> veins

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
essentially you've got pulmonary veins

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.770 
essentially you've got pulmonary veins
and<00:03:31.560> of<00:03:32.190> course<00:03:32.400> those<00:03:32.700> are<00:03:32.730> taken<00:03:33.180> blood<00:03:33.510> to

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
and of course those are taken blood to

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.770 
and of course those are taken blood to
the<00:03:33.959> lungs<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.970> around<00:03:35.970> in<00:03:36.150> here<00:03:36.329> somewhere

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
the lungs and around in here somewhere

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.390 
the lungs and around in here somewhere
and<00:03:37.200> I<00:03:37.290> cut<00:03:37.799> part<00:03:38.280> of<00:03:38.370> it<00:03:38.519> is<00:03:39.319> there<00:03:40.319> it<00:03:40.410> is

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
and I cut part of it is there it is

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.500 
and I cut part of it is there it is
one<00:03:43.400> of<00:03:43.520> these<00:03:43.580> I<00:03:43.790> cut<00:03:44.060> my<00:03:44.660> cut<00:03:44.930> part<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.320> the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
one of these I cut my cut part of the

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.790 
one of these I cut my cut part of the
lobe<00:03:47.510> that<00:03:47.540> goes<00:03:47.870> into<00:03:48.080> it<00:03:48.200> but<00:03:48.260> maybe<00:03:48.560> not

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
lobe that goes into it but maybe not

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.760 
lobe that goes into it but maybe not
this<00:03:49.010> one

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:50.770 
this one

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:53.260 
this one
but<00:03:51.770> when<00:03:51.920> you<00:03:52.040> when<00:03:52.370> you<00:03:52.490> probe<00:03:52.760> around<00:03:53.030> in

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:53.270 
but when you when you probe around in

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.910 
but when you when you probe around in
here<00:03:53.600> and<00:03:53.720> eventually<00:03:54.320> we<00:03:54.410> can<00:03:54.590> get<00:03:54.740> these

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
here and eventually we can get these

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.220 
here and eventually we can get these
cleaned<00:03:55.160> out<00:03:55.280> so<00:03:55.490> here<00:03:56.210> for<00:03:56.690> example<00:03:56.750> it's

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 
cleaned out so here for example it's

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.050 
cleaned out so here for example it's
just<00:03:57.380> as<00:03:57.530> I<00:03:57.680> think<00:03:58.610> a<00:03:58.670> little<00:03:58.790> bit<00:03:59.000> more

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
just as I think a little bit more

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:02.290 
just as I think a little bit more
connective<00:03:59.900> tissue<00:04:00.110> out<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.410> the<00:04:00.500> way<00:04:01.150> we<00:04:02.150> can

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:02.300 
connective tissue out of the way we can

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.900 
connective tissue out of the way we can
begin<00:04:02.540> to<00:04:02.810> see<00:04:03.170> in<00:04:03.380> fact<00:04:03.620> here's<00:04:03.950> here's

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
begin to see in fact here's here's

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:06.790 
begin to see in fact here's here's
another<00:04:05.240> subdivision<00:04:05.840> going<00:04:06.380> into<00:04:06.650> another

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
another subdivision going into another

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.090 
another subdivision going into another
lobe<00:04:07.130> over<00:04:07.490> here<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:09.260> you<00:04:09.320> see<00:04:09.410> you<00:04:09.710> can<00:04:09.830> see

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.100 
lobe over here so you see you can see

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.040 
lobe over here so you see you can see
that<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.490> eventually<00:04:10.910> when<00:04:11.540> they<00:04:11.660> get<00:04:11.840> down

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
that and eventually when they get down

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.690 
that and eventually when they get down
small<00:04:12.500> like<00:04:12.710> that<00:04:12.890> then<00:04:13.160> it<00:04:13.280> becomes<00:04:13.550> more

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:13.700 
small like that then it becomes more

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.380 
small like that then it becomes more
difficult<00:04:13.760> sees<00:04:14.570> you<00:04:14.690> in<00:04:14.750> a<00:04:14.810> written<00:04:14.960> report
