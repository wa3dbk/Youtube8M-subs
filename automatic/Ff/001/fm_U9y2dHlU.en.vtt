00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:38.989
 the nouns or sirens of the arctic beings 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:42.050
 whites of the sea have called them 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.629
 many ways are how you can see the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:47.089
 photographs that I'm going to put at the end 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.700
 I'm going to put some of them some 

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.190
 which are drawings made by artists in 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.289
 Based on what has been said that the form 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.969
 they have and others that are 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.129
 alleged photographs about these beings 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:59.899
 but first of all let me tell you 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.940
 what is the context of this story 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:07.310
 Japan is one of the countries that has more 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.160
 they have the myths and legends more 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.240
 interesting from Asia does not really have 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:16.610
 spectacular things and start being a 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:19.460
 apparently very rational country very 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.820
 mental also has that other side not the 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.540
 side maybe 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.970
 the fantasy of the imagination but in 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:31.720
 this time I was struck by this 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.520
 issue because it does not come from fishermen who 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.190
 maybe they are susceptible to these 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.650
 stories either by tradition or 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.860
 simply for believing in this kind of 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:44.800
 things if it does not come from a scientific group 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.479
 who is in charge of investigating then the 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.619
 behavior of whales throughout 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.810
 the world a Japanese group and they have not 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:57.100
 dearly acknowledge this issue 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.830
 because obviously it is at stake because the 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.530
 career of scientists in this 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:06.840
 occasion of researchers on whale 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:10.230
 no but the no no ming them in 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.910
 they would be a kind of beings 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.519
 humanoids inside the sea that 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.110
 they find in the arctic around 20 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:23.540
 30 meters totally white 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:26.370
 without nose eyes and mouth and without ears and 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:29.280
 Well, so far, some of them have been tested 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.430
 with photographs as you can right now 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.430
 watch 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:37.850
 there is one of these photographs that go 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.660
 to see now is taken directly from 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:45.830
 google is a google image that is 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.860
 quite strange figure and it is according to 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.340
 reports have been seen with hands and 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.950
 quite long feet not very similar to 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.840
 the figure of the human being but in something 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:00.750
 resembles and 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.000
 a legend a mixture between science and 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.459
 Legend and myth do not know exactly 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.200
 because right now there are no tests but 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:13.769
 if something remains as a possibility 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:17.610
 that this was real is that now 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.760
 it is known that we know very little about 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.000
 sea ​​that we really are between a 5 and 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.090
 10 percent knowledge of 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.069
 marine species everything else is 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.220
 simply a mystery to us 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.980
 there in the sea we do not know each 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.870
 these dives 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.790
 super advanced submarines that achieve 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.680
 really enter the depths of the 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.620
 sea ​​come back with a lot of 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:45.480
 information and they come back with many 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.360
 photographs and images of new 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.760
 species followed year after year the last 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.840
 five or six years that have been good 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.239
 making the incredible discovery 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.700
 species but we're still very 

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:59.310
 far to be able to say that we know 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.220
 really the sea then this leaves us 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.350
 a possibility or a door to this type 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.590
 of topics and that's why I bring you 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:10.330
 so well this would probably be 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:12.580
 my most interesting beings right now 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.410
 in Japan some speak it only 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.600
 as an urban legend others 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.360
 they simply say they are 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:22.300
 stories and very old myths brought 

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:23.650
 again to the present whether or not it is here 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.500
 I leave this images and well then 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:28.060
 continued explaining on twitter in the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.590
 green route and see you in the next 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.490
 hangout and there we will be talking 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.490
 also see you later 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.800
