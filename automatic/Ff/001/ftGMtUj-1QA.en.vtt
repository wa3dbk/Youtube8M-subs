here on this plate will be using Queen

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.790 
here on this plate will be using Queen
1:18<00:03:16.270> and<00:03:16.480> I'll<00:03:16.660> be<00:03:16.780> using<00:03:16.960> my<00:03:17.170> with<00:03:17.410> stoniest

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
or jelly replacement heads this is the

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.430 
or jelly replacement heads this is the
firmest<00:03:21.040> one<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:21.700> my<00:03:22.450> opinion<00:03:22.840> I<00:03:22.960> think<00:03:22.990> the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.380 
firmest one and my opinion I think the
firmer<00:03:23.830> stampers<00:03:24.280> are<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.550> best<00:03:24.760> for<00:03:25.240> this

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
firmer stampers are the best for this

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.690 
firmer stampers are the best for this
technique<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:26.560> Queen<00:03:26.800> cosmetic<00:03:27.310> is<00:03:27.460> way<00:03:27.640> too

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
technique the Queen cosmetic is way too

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.030 
technique the Queen cosmetic is way too
soft<00:03:28.120> I<00:03:28.330> tried<00:03:28.660> it<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.080> it's<00:03:29.320> just<00:03:29.680> way<00:03:30.010> way

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
soft I tried it and it's just way way

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.850 
soft I tried it and it's just way way
too<00:03:30.310> soft<00:03:30.730> so<00:03:30.970> what<00:03:31.360> after<00:03:31.720> you<00:03:31.840> apply<00:03:32.080> you

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
too soft so what after you apply you

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.170 
too soft so what after you apply you
know<00:03:32.980> the<00:03:33.100> colors<00:03:33.370> and<00:03:33.640> everything<00:03:33.790> you<00:03:34.030> let

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
know the colors and everything you let

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.060 
know the colors and everything you let
it<00:03:34.270> dry<00:03:34.450> and<00:03:34.810> when<00:03:35.320> you<00:03:35.410> apply<00:03:35.590> it<00:03:35.650> on<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:35.890> nail

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
it dry and when you apply it on the nail

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.970 
it dry and when you apply it on the nail
it<00:03:36.310> just<00:03:36.580> this<00:03:36.910> distorts<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.020> image<00:03:38.350> it<00:03:38.650> just

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
it just this distorts the image it just

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.590 
it just this distorts the image it just
looks<00:03:39.130> all<00:03:39.310> wonky<00:03:39.550> doesn't<00:03:40.090> look<00:03:40.210> right

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
looks all wonky doesn't look right

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.300 
looks all wonky doesn't look right
alright<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.350> that's<00:03:41.470> because<00:03:41.800> it<00:03:41.980> stampers

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
alright and that's because it stampers

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.720 
alright and that's because it stampers
way<00:03:42.520> way<00:03:42.850> way<00:03:43.090> too<00:03:43.120> soft<00:03:43.720> all<00:03:44.110> right<00:03:44.550> but<00:03:45.550> of

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
way way way too soft all right but of

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.460 
way way way too soft all right but of
course<00:03:45.940> the<00:03:46.060> Stamper<00:03:46.420> snaps<00:03:46.660> beautifully<00:03:47.260> but

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
course the Stamper snaps beautifully but

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.860 
course the Stamper snaps beautifully but
in<00:03:47.590> my<00:03:47.710> opinion<00:03:47.830> for<00:03:48.490> this<00:03:48.700> technique<00:03:49.090> it

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
in my opinion for this technique it

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.680 
in my opinion for this technique it
doesn't<00:03:50.320> work<00:03:50.680> out<00:03:50.890> great<00:03:51.610> so<00:03:51.970> I'm<00:03:52.510> going<00:03:52.660> to

that and I could play with just a little
bit<00:04:55.280> here<00:04:55.640> I<00:04:56.950> need<00:04:57.950> to<00:04:58.010> be<00:04:58.340> if<00:04:58.520> you<00:04:58.730> want<00:04:58.880> to<00:04:58.940> be

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
bit here I need to be if you want to be

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.330 
bit here I need to be if you want to be
safe<00:04:59.330> you<00:04:59.360> can<00:04:59.750> go<00:04:59.870> ahead<00:05:00.020> and<00:05:00.200> apply<00:05:00.410> it<00:05:00.650> clear

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:01.340 
safe you can go ahead and apply it clear

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.480 
safe you can go ahead and apply it clear
all<00:05:01.580> over<00:05:02.060> and<00:05:02.660> now<00:05:03.650> we<00:05:03.710> just<00:05:04.040> wait<00:05:04.160> for<00:05:04.220> it<00:05:04.400> to

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:04.490 
all over and now we just wait for it to

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:08.110 
all over and now we just wait for it to
dry<00:05:04.790> and<00:05:05.740> as<00:05:06.740> soon<00:05:06.920> as<00:05:07.040> it<00:05:07.160> dries<00:05:07.400> we<00:05:07.790> apply<00:05:08.060> it

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
dry and as soon as it dries we apply it

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.360 
dry and as soon as it dries we apply it
to<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:08.360> new<00:05:08.630> can't<00:05:09.110> wait<00:05:09.260> too<00:05:09.440> long<00:05:09.590> because

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:10.370 
to the new can't wait too long because

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:12.640 
to the new can't wait too long because
if<00:05:10.640> it's<00:05:10.790> too<00:05:10.910> dry<00:05:11.090> it's<00:05:11.570> not<00:05:11.930> going<00:05:12.290> to<00:05:12.440> stick

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
if it's too dry it's not going to stick

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:15.820 
if it's too dry it's not going to stick
on<00:05:12.890> and<00:05:13.310> if<00:05:13.430> it's<00:05:13.640> too<00:05:14.300> wet<00:05:14.570> it's<00:05:15.290> gonna<00:05:15.620> be<00:05:15.800> a

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
on and if it's too wet it's gonna be a

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.040 
on and if it's too wet it's gonna be a
mess<00:05:16.100> as<00:05:16.370> well<00:05:16.760> this<00:05:17.270> really<00:05:17.600> just<00:05:17.630> takes

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
mess as well this really just takes

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.400 
mess as well this really just takes
practice<00:05:18.500> to<00:05:18.890> know<00:05:19.160> when<00:05:19.760> is<00:05:19.970> the<00:05:20.210> time<00:05:20.450> to

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
practice to know when is the time to

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.610 
practice to know when is the time to
apply<00:05:21.770> but<00:05:22.460> I<00:05:22.520> usually<00:05:23.060> just<00:05:23.240> touch<00:05:23.450> it<00:05:23.660> if<00:05:24.500> I

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
apply but I usually just touch it if I

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.610 
apply but I usually just touch it if I
see<00:05:24.830> fingerprints<00:05:25.280> I<00:05:25.520> know<00:05:25.610> it's<00:05:25.940> not<00:05:26.120> done

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
see fingerprints I know it's not done

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.150 
see fingerprints I know it's not done
but<00:05:27.620> if<00:05:27.890> I<00:05:28.100> don't<00:05:28.570> then<00:05:29.570> it's<00:05:29.720> done<00:05:29.930> so<00:05:30.710> now<00:05:30.890> I'm

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 
but if I don't then it's done so now I'm

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.650 
but if I don't then it's done so now I'm
going<00:05:31.400> to<00:05:31.960> just<00:05:33.760> try<00:05:34.760> to<00:05:34.820> center<00:05:35.240> her

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660
