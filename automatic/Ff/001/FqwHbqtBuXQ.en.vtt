the the galvanizing slightly just then
just<00:02:48.510> along<00:02:48.780> there<00:02:49.250> but<00:02:50.250> that's<00:02:50.370> about<00:02:50.580> it

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
just along there but that's about it

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
around the back end it's obviously had

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.670 
around the back end it's obviously had
some<00:02:54.540> work<00:02:54.690> on<00:02:54.810> the<00:02:54.930> crossmember<00:02:55.410> at<00:02:55.500> some

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
some work on the crossmember at some

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.780 
some work on the crossmember at some
points<00:02:56.130> there's<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.459> big<00:02:56.640> impact<00:02:57.570> around<00:02:57.989> there

00:02:58.780 --> 00:02:58.790 
points there's a big impact around there

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:00.830

mounts<00:03:01.200> I<00:03:01.290> think<00:03:03.260> but<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.350> crossmember<00:03:04.739> seems

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
mounts I think but the crossmember seems

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.830 
mounts I think but the crossmember seems
pretty<00:03:05.100> solid<00:03:08.000> tailgates<00:03:09.000> all<00:03:09.180> nice<00:03:09.390> in<00:03:09.690> the

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
actually make it quite floppy which is

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.949 
actually make it quite floppy which is
when<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.579> really<00:04:09.000> think<00:04:09.180> about<00:04:09.420> changing

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:09.959 
when you really think about changing

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:11.630 
when you really think about changing
them<00:04:10.109> and<00:04:10.380> doesn't<00:04:11.100> have<00:04:11.160> too<00:04:11.340> much<00:04:11.459> of<00:04:11.579> a

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
them and doesn't have too much of a

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.819 
them and doesn't have too much of a
draft<00:04:11.880> in<00:04:12.090> but<00:04:12.329> really<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.380> driver's<00:04:13.709> door

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:13.829 
draft in but really the driver's door

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.130 
draft in but really the driver's door
top<00:04:14.100> is<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.430> one<00:04:14.880> bit<00:04:15.120> that's<00:04:15.329> um<00:04:15.570> it's

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
top is the one bit that's um it's

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.670 
top is the one bit that's um it's
probably<00:04:16.229> past<00:04:16.500> its<00:04:16.769> best<00:04:16.829> should<00:04:17.130> we<00:04:17.220> say

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 
probably past its best should we say

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.599 
probably past its best should we say
