00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
certain amount of time and based on

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.770 
certain amount of time and based on
several<00:00:50.190> factors<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:51.059> watch<00:00:51.239> make<00:00:51.570> some

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
several factors the watch make some

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.389 
several factors the watch make some
calculations<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.680> determines<00:00:53.190> how<00:00:53.340> many

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
calculations and determines how many

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.189 
calculations and determines how many
calories<00:00:53.760> you've<00:00:54.270> burned<00:00:54.300> during<00:00:54.960> your

calories you've burned during your

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.360 
calories you've burned during your
session<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:56.309> it's<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.760> handy<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:58.370> and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
session so it's really handy to have and

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
and then I'm going to take my pulse and

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.490 
and then I'm going to take my pulse and
it's<00:02:15.270> going<00:02:15.360> to<00:02:15.420> make<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.599> calculation<00:02:15.930> based

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
it's going to make a calculation based

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.320 
it's going to make a calculation based
on<00:02:16.770> several<00:02:17.069> factors<00:02:17.220> determine<00:02:18.120> how<00:02:18.270> many

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
on several factors determine how many

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.660 
on several factors determine how many
calories<00:02:18.630> that<00:02:18.959> I<00:02:19.020> burned<00:02:19.290> so<00:02:20.040> I<00:02:20.310> set<00:02:20.580> this

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
calories that I burned so I set this

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.490 
calories that I burned so I set this
right<00:02:20.819> here<00:02:21.060> I'll<00:02:21.209> be<00:02:21.330> right<00:02:21.510> back<00:02:21.690> and<00:02:22.050> I

right here I'll be right back and I

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.820 
right here I'll be right back and I
don't<00:02:22.650> know<00:02:22.739> an<00:02:22.860> hour<00:02:22.950> or<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.650> okay<00:02:25.650> we're<00:02:25.800> back

sensor because now it's going to take

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.820 
sensor because now it's going to take
our<00:02:54.330> pulse<00:02:54.600> so<00:02:55.260> we're<00:02:55.350> going<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.530> hold<00:02:55.709> our

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.789 
our pulse so we're going to hold our
finger<00:02:56.130> there<00:02:56.310> lightly<00:02:57.410> you<00:02:58.410> can<00:02:58.560> see<00:02:58.709> how

00:02:58.789 --> 00:02:58.799 
finger there lightly you can see how

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.490 
finger there lightly you can see how
heart<00:02:59.100> beating<00:02:59.459> on<00:02:59.549> the<00:02:59.610> left<00:02:59.850> there<00:03:00.500> every

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
heart beating on the left there every

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.780 
heart beating on the left there every
time<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.739> see<00:03:01.890> that<00:03:02.040> heart<00:03:02.340> that<00:03:02.610> means

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
time you see that heart that means

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.390 
time you see that heart that means
that's<00:03:03.330> it's<00:03:03.660> registering<00:03:04.110> my<00:03:04.290> pulse<00:03:07.100> okay<00:03:08.100> so

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
that's it's registering my pulse okay so

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.370 
that's it's registering my pulse okay so
for<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.180> hour<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:09.569> a<00:03:09.600> half<00:03:09.810> that<00:03:10.110> I<00:03:10.170> did

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
for that hour and a half that I did

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.150 
for that hour and a half that I did
absolutely<00:03:10.739> nothing<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.900> burned<00:03:12.900> 182<00:03:13.650> calories

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
absolutely nothing I burned 182 calories

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.850 
absolutely nothing I burned 182 calories
and<00:03:14.400> that's<00:03:15.060> based<00:03:15.330> on<00:03:15.540> many<00:03:15.959> factors<00:03:16.230> such<00:03:16.830> as

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
and that's based on many factors such as

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.590 
and that's based on many factors such as
that<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:17.310> already<00:03:17.459> put<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:17.760> here<00:03:17.970> such<00:03:18.239> as<00:03:18.390> my

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:18.600 
that I already put in here such as my

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.590 
that I already put in here such as my
age<00:03:18.870> my<00:03:19.280> weight<00:03:20.280> my<00:03:20.310> date<00:03:20.760> of<00:03:20.880> date<00:03:21.359> of<00:03:21.480> birth

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
age my weight my date of date of birth

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.170 
age my weight my date of date of birth
already<00:03:21.810> said<00:03:22.109> that<00:03:22.549> without<00:03:23.549> a<00:03:23.700> male<00:03:23.970> or

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
already said that without a male or

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.410 
already said that without a male or
female<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.950> so<00:03:26.340> what<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.609> does<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.910> takes<00:03:27.120> the

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:27.420 
female and so what it does it takes the

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.090 
female and so what it does it takes the
the<00:03:27.660> information<00:03:28.200> it<00:03:28.380> calculates<00:03:28.950> it

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
the information it calculates it

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.530 
the information it calculates it
according<00:03:29.519> to<00:03:29.549> your<00:03:29.640> heart<00:03:29.970> rate<00:03:30.180> according

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
according to your heart rate according

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.569 
according to your heart rate according
to<00:03:30.840> how<00:03:31.019> long<00:03:31.320> you've<00:03:31.530> exercised<00:03:32.100> it<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.519> it

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
to how long you've exercised it and it

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:37.729 
to how long you've exercised it and it
does<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:35.180> calculation<00:03:36.180> based<00:03:36.750> on<00:03:37.109> all<00:03:37.470> those

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
does a calculation based on all those

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:39.560 
does a calculation based on all those
factors<00:03:38.040> to<00:03:38.400> determine<00:03:38.430> approximately<00:03:39.420> how

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
factors to determine approximately how

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.890 
factors to determine approximately how
many<00:03:39.630> calories<00:03:39.989> you<00:03:40.440> burned<00:03:41.090> to<00:03:42.090> set<00:03:42.630> the

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
many calories you burned to set the

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.430 
many calories you burned to set the
watch<00:03:43.109> you<00:03:43.799> just<00:03:44.190> hold<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.519> set<00:03:44.730> button<00:03:44.760> down
