we<00:00:00.269> interrupt<00:00:00.599> this<00:00:00.659> program<00:00:00.960> for<00:00:00.989> an<00:00:01.110> import

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
we interrupt this program for an import

we interrupt this program for an import
yeah<00:00:05.150> can<00:00:06.150> you<00:00:06.180> tell<00:00:06.509> me<00:00:06.660> how<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.839> fix<00:00:07.140> high

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
yeah can you tell me how to fix high

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.669 
yeah can you tell me how to fix high
latency<00:00:07.740> on<00:00:08.069> Xbox<00:00:08.670> one<00:00:09.650> Microsoft's<00:00:10.650> first

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.860

recommendation<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.300> check<00:00:12.509> your<00:00:12.540> internet

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
recommendation is to check your internet

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.440 
recommendation is to check your internet
connection<00:00:13.650> so<00:00:14.549> they<00:00:14.700> want<00:00:14.940> to<00:00:15.000> blame<00:00:15.269> the

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
connection so they want to blame the

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.670 
connection so they want to blame the
ISPs<00:00:16.049> or<00:00:17.010> your<00:00:17.310> bandwidth<00:00:18.020> after<00:00:19.020> all<00:00:19.199> you're

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
ISPs or your bandwidth after all you're

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.710 
ISPs or your bandwidth after all you're
going<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:20.130> have<00:00:20.340> high<00:00:20.550> latency<00:00:21.000> issues<00:00:21.539> if

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
going to have high latency issues if

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.450 
going to have high latency issues if
someone<00:00:22.140> else<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.590> house<00:00:22.769> is<00:00:22.800> streaming

someone else in the house is streaming

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.109 
someone else in the house is streaming
Netflix<00:00:23.970> or<00:00:24.769> downloading<00:00:25.769> from<00:00:25.949> github<00:00:26.220> or<00:00:26.640> if

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
Netflix or downloading from github or if

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.240 
Netflix or downloading from github or if
the<00:00:27.269> ISP<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.990> throttling<00:00:28.560> your<00:00:28.769> connection

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
the ISP is throttling your connection

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.790 
the ISP is throttling your connection
because<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:29.939> usually<00:00:30.210> do<00:00:30.630> all<00:00:30.840> three<00:00:31.170> at<00:00:31.289> once

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
because you usually do all three at once

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.790 
because you usually do all three at once
no<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:33.329> gaming<00:00:33.660> while<00:00:33.809> someone<00:00:34.230> else<00:00:34.350> checks

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
no just gaming while someone else checks

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.459 
no just gaming while someone else checks

running a Wi-Fi hotspot while you're on

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.410 
running a Wi-Fi hotspot while you're on
Wi-Fi<00:00:43.440> can<00:00:43.950> cause<00:00:44.190> them<00:00:44.489> to<00:00:44.700> interfere<00:00:45.239> with

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
Wi-Fi can cause them to interfere with

Wi-Fi can cause them to interfere with
each<00:00:45.629> other<00:00:45.930> it'll<00:00:46.920> definitely<00:00:47.219> increase<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
each other it'll definitely increase the

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.139 
each other it'll definitely increase the
latency<00:00:48.660> too<00:00:49.649> much<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.129> good<00:00:50.280> thing<00:00:50.489> then

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
latency too much of a good thing then

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.139 
latency too much of a good thing then
and<00:00:51.570> you<00:00:52.379> could<00:00:52.559> have<00:00:52.710> high<00:00:52.920> latency<00:00:53.340> because

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
and you could have high latency because

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.090 
and you could have high latency because
you<00:00:54.300> have<00:00:54.420> poor<00:00:54.660> Wi-Fi<00:00:55.170> connectivity<00:00:55.620> while

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
just you it will slow down I wonder how
