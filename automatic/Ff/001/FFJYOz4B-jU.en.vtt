00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
have a more gray undertone to them so

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.720 
have a more gray undertone to them so
this<00:02:54.870> makes<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.440> shading<00:02:55.859> look<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.250> little<00:02:56.519> bit

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
this makes the shading look a little bit

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.629 
this makes the shading look a little bit
more<00:02:56.970> believable<00:03:00.859> to<00:03:01.859> make<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.159> contours

Angelina's brows were very
