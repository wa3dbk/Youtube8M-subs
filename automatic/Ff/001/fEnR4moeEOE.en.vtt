00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
Abbie and there's also down here all the

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.569 
Abbie and there's also down here all the
other<00:00:47.530> school<00:00:47.890> they<00:00:48.039> were<00:00:48.100> amazed<00:00:48.550> halls<00:00:49.140> and

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
other school they were amazed halls and

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.150 
other school they were amazed halls and
also<00:00:51.579> it's<00:00:52.390> just<00:00:52.480> my<00:00:52.749> opinion<00:00:53.289> and<00:00:53.530> I<00:00:53.890> think

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:54.160 
also it's just my opinion and I think

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.130 
also it's just my opinion and I think
they<00:00:54.309> should<00:00:54.519> have<00:00:54.609> just<00:00:54.640> made<00:00:54.999> either<00:00:55.539> a<00:00:55.749> be

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
they should have just made either a be

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.369 
they should have just made either a be
just<00:00:56.350> as<00:00:56.530> one<00:00:56.739> doll<00:00:57.010> or<00:00:57.449> maybe<00:00:58.449> special<00:00:59.230> with

00:00:59.369 --> 00:00:59.379 
just as one doll or maybe special with

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.349 
just as one doll or maybe special with
her<00:00:59.530> instead<00:01:00.219> of<00:01:00.280> making<00:01:00.640> ghoulia<00:01:01.030> with<00:01:01.239> her

00:01:01.349 --> 00:01:01.359 
her instead of making ghoulia with her

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.509 
her instead of making ghoulia with her
because<00:01:01.539> Google<00:01:01.780> he<00:01:01.870> already<00:01:02.079> has<00:01:02.289> it<00:01:02.469> all<00:01:02.589> but

00:01:03.509 --> 00:01:03.519
