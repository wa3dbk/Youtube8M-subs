00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
impression on me we were young people

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.390 
impression on me we were young people
growing<00:00:47.920> up<00:00:48.190> and<00:00:48.690> our<00:00:49.690> minds<00:00:50.110> were<00:00:50.560> open<00:00:51.160> to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
growing up and our minds were open to

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.290 
growing up and our minds were open to
explore<00:00:53.010> these<00:00:54.010> were<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.490> early<00:00:54.670> years<00:00:55.000> when

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:55.300 
explore these were the early years when

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.780 
explore these were the early years when
you<00:00:56.260> know<00:00:56.410> they're<00:00:56.590> polo<00:00:56.830> missions<00:00:57.310> had

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
you know they're polo missions had

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.540 
you know they're polo missions had
happened<00:00:58.320> man<00:00:59.320> had<00:00:59.560> been<00:00:59.710> landed<00:01:00.100> on<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.340> moon

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:00.550 
happened man had been landed on the moon

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:03.870 
happened man had been landed on the moon
and<00:01:01.000> so<00:01:01.600> we<00:01:01.810> were<00:01:01.900> curious<00:01:02.140> about<00:01:02.440> space<00:01:03.010> for

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:03.880 
and so we were curious about space for

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.300 
and so we were curious about space for
instance<00:01:04.180> I<00:01:04.239> couldn't<00:01:04.570> you<00:01:05.469> know<00:01:05.500> imagine<00:01:06.189> the

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
instance I couldn't you know imagine the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.459 
instance I couldn't you know imagine the
distance<00:01:06.700> between<00:01:06.909> the<00:01:07.149> Sun<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:07.509> the<00:01:07.750> earth

00:01:08.459 --> 00:01:08.469 
distance between the Sun and the earth

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:11.880 
distance between the Sun and the earth
and<00:01:08.950> so<00:01:09.700> he<00:01:09.909> started<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.359> write<00:01:10.539> you<00:01:11.049> know<00:01:11.200> from

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
and so he started to write you know from

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:13.440 
and so he started to write you know from
the<00:01:12.009> end<00:01:12.219> of<00:01:12.399> the<00:01:12.490> blackboard<00:01:12.939> and<00:01:13.149> said<00:01:13.329> the

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
the end of the blackboard and said the

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.330 
the end of the blackboard and said the
Sun<00:01:13.689> how<00:01:14.229> many<00:01:14.409> miles<00:01:14.530> is<00:01:14.679> a<00:01:14.740> Sun<00:01:15.009> from<00:01:15.280> the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
Sun how many miles is a Sun from the

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:16.739 
Sun how many miles is a Sun from the
earth<00:01:15.429> and<00:01:15.789> of<00:01:15.909> course<00:01:16.119> he<00:01:16.240> covered<00:01:16.570> the

00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:16.749 
earth and of course he covered the

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:18.539 
earth and of course he covered the
blackboard<00:01:17.499> to<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:17.740> other<00:01:17.829> end<00:01:18.070> with<00:01:18.249> zeros

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
blackboard to the other end with zeros

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:20.999 
blackboard to the other end with zeros
and<00:01:18.700> said<00:01:18.880> he<00:01:18.999> needed<00:01:19.179> some<00:01:19.299> more<00:01:19.679> space<00:01:20.679> to<00:01:20.710> be

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
and said he needed some more space to be

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.999

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
lot of us fall in love with science and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.300 
lot of us fall in love with science and
so<00:01:27.100> many<00:01:27.640> of<00:01:27.850> my<00:01:27.880> friends<00:01:28.210> who<00:01:29.039> continue<00:01:30.039> to<00:01:30.069> do

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
outcome with while and I say the same

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.169 
outcome with while and I say the same
for<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.619> Peace<00:01:53.799> Corps<00:01:54.039> I<00:01:54.280> believe<00:01:54.819> that<00:01:54.850> its
