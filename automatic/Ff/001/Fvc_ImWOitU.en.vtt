now and both teams couldn't beat us in
terms<00:01:56.310> of<00:01:56.549> goals<00:01:57.000> you<00:01:57.600> know<00:01:57.630> like<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.409> know

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
terms of goals you know like you know

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.990 
terms of goals you know like you know
I'm<00:01:58.590> trying<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.860> see<00:01:58.979> like<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.610> imagine<00:01:59.939> I'll

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
I'm trying to see like the imagine I'll

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.969 
I'm trying to see like the imagine I'll
end<00:02:00.390> it<00:02:00.479> now<00:02:00.630> and<00:02:00.750> they<00:02:00.810> were<00:02:00.899> family<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.619> ended

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
end it now and they were family it ended

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.859 
end it now and they were family it ended
2-2<00:02:02.219> apparently<00:02:03.149> she<00:02:03.299> takes<00:02:03.509> they<00:02:03.630> can<00:02:03.780> go

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
2-2 apparently she takes they can go

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.240 
2-2 apparently she takes they can go
either<00:02:04.049> way<00:02:04.229> but<00:02:04.380> effectively<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.070> game

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
either way but effectively the game

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.859 
either way but effectively the game
still<00:02:05.460> ends<00:02:05.670> 22<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.299> fact<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.570> Bayern

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
still ends 22 so the fact that Bayern

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.919 
still ends 22 so the fact that Bayern
Munich<00:02:07.110> could<00:02:07.259> not<00:02:07.500> beat<00:02:08.099> us<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.629> normal<00:02:09.629> time

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
Munich could not beat us in normal time

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.479 
Munich could not beat us in normal time
and<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.229> took<00:02:10.379> penalties<00:02:10.830> for<00:02:10.950> him<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.160> beat<00:02:11.310> us

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
and it took penalties for him to beat us

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.050 
and it took penalties for him to beat us
you<00:02:11.940> got<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.239> see<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:12.510> as<00:02:12.569> a<00:02:12.629> positive

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
you got to see that as a positive

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.110 
you got to see that as a positive
it<00:02:13.150> also<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:14.620> on<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.160> pitch<00:02:15.400> there<00:02:15.700> were<00:02:15.819> so

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
it also the on the pitch there were so

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.750 
it also the on the pitch there were so
many<00:02:16.739> positives<00:02:17.739> the<00:02:18.190> fact<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.489> Bayern

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
many positives the fact that Bayern

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.920 
many positives the fact that Bayern
Munich<00:02:19.000> are<00:02:19.090> probably<00:02:19.360> one<00:02:19.569> of<00:02:19.599> the<00:02:19.720> best

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
Munich are probably one of the best

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.479 
Munich are probably one of the best
attacking<00:02:20.349> teams<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.099> fact<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.340> we

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
attacking teams and the fact that we

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.729 
attacking teams and the fact that we
were<00:02:21.580> able<00:02:21.640> to<00:02:21.880> hold<00:02:22.660> him<00:02:22.870> back<00:02:23.080> as<00:02:23.230> much<00:02:23.410> as<00:02:23.470> we

00:02:23.729 --> 00:02:23.739 
were able to hold him back as much as we

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.170 
were able to hold him back as much as we
did<00:02:23.920> it<00:02:24.069> we<00:02:24.160> defended<00:02:24.580> absolutely

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
did it we defended absolutely

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.630 
did it we defended absolutely
sensational<00:02:25.599> and<00:02:26.319> the<00:02:26.440> other<00:02:26.680> cities<00:02:27.250> one

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
sensational and the other cities one

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.699 
sensational and the other cities one
poem<00:02:27.970> with<00:02:28.120> our<00:02:28.270> defense<00:02:28.630> and<00:02:28.780> it's<00:02:29.260> not<00:02:29.500> the

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
poem with our defense and it's not the

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.229 
poem with our defense and it's not the
player<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.220> just<00:02:30.580> think<00:02:30.700> it's<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:30.970> way<00:02:31.090> that

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
player I just think it's the way that

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.580 
player I just think it's the way that
you<00:02:31.330> place<00:02:31.569> and<00:02:31.870> that<00:02:31.900> is<00:02:32.080> Branislav<00:02:32.560> Ivanovic

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
you place and that is Branislav Ivanovic

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.820 
you place and that is Branislav Ivanovic
I<00:02:33.190> think<00:02:33.430> at<00:02:33.580> right-back<00:02:33.940> he<00:02:34.540> does<00:02:34.840> you<00:02:35.680> know

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
I think at right-back he does you know

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.250 
I think at right-back he does you know
if<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.970> watch<00:02:37.209> him<00:02:37.480> I'm<00:02:37.690> not<00:02:37.900> you<00:02:38.080> know<00:02:38.140> I'm

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
if you watch him I'm not you know I'm

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.540 
if you watch him I'm not you know I'm
not<00:02:38.620> just<00:02:38.800> saying<00:02:38.920> it<00:02:39.010> to<00:02:39.069> pick<00:02:39.310> on<00:02:39.459> him

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:39.550 
not just saying it to pick on him

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.650 
not just saying it to pick on him
because<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:39.849> think<00:02:40.030> he<00:02:40.090> had<00:02:40.180> a<00:02:40.209> great<00:02:40.480> game<00:02:40.599> last

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
because I think he had a great game last

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.170 
because I think he had a great game last
night<00:02:41.050> but<00:02:41.739> they<00:02:41.830> have<00:02:42.010> so<00:02:42.370> much<00:02:42.550> an<00:02:42.700> accessory

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
night but they have so much an accessory

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.180 
night but they have so much an accessory
to<00:02:43.209> left<00:02:43.510> outside<00:02:43.720> because<00:02:44.230> if<00:02:44.800> you<00:02:44.950> watch

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
to left outside because if you watch

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.550 
to left outside because if you watch
brands<00:02:45.760> when<00:02:46.239> he's<00:02:46.360> defended<00:02:46.840> right<00:02:47.140> back<00:02:47.319> he

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
brands when he's defended right back he

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.770 
brands when he's defended right back he
gets<00:02:47.739> sucked<00:02:48.370> in<00:02:48.670> towards<00:02:48.880> the<00:02:49.150> 18<00:02:49.510> yard<00:02:49.660> box

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:49.780 
gets sucked in towards the 18 yard box

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:51.270 
gets sucked in towards the 18 yard box
where<00:02:50.080> he<00:02:50.140> should<00:02:50.319> be<00:02:50.350> staying<00:02:50.650> deep<00:02:51.010> and

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
where he should be staying deep and

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.340 
where he should be staying deep and
trying<00:02:51.910> to<00:02:52.000> stick<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.390> winger<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:53.140> get

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
trying to stick to that winger you get

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.140 
trying to stick to that winger you get
sucked<00:02:53.739> in<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.130> sometimes<00:02:54.850> he<00:02:55.030> has<00:02:55.090> a

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 
sucked in and sometimes he has a

great<00:06:09.300> to<00:06:09.360> see<00:06:09.690> I<00:06:09.720> think<00:06:09.870> he<00:06:10.020> was<00:06:10.170> phenomenal

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:15.320 
really really good the two midfielders

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:18.110 
really really good the two midfielders
Ramirez<00:06:16.320> and<00:06:16.530> Frank<00:06:17.130> Lampard<00:06:17.460> was<00:06:17.730> solid<00:06:18.000> as

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:18.120 
Ramirez and Frank Lampard was solid as

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.080 
Ramirez and Frank Lampard was solid as
normal<00:06:18.510> for<00:06:18.660> me<00:06:19.110> looking<00:06:19.560> back<00:06:19.770> at<00:06:20.010> the<00:06:20.370> the

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.090 
normal for me looking back at the the

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.410 
normal for me looking back at the the
red<00:06:21.480> card<00:06:21.750> that<00:06:22.290> definitely<00:06:22.620> was<00:06:23.300> that<00:06:24.300> was

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:24.420 
red card that definitely was that was

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:26.540 
red card that definitely was that was
definitely<00:06:24.540> in<00:06:24.840> my<00:06:24.870> opinion<00:06:25.230> a<00:06:25.470> worthy<00:06:26.400> of<00:06:26.460> a

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
definitely in my opinion a worthy of a

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.150 
definitely in my opinion a worthy of a
second<00:06:26.910> yellow<00:06:27.150> so<00:06:27.870> for<00:06:28.080> me<00:06:28.200> like<00:06:28.440> I<00:06:28.590> can't<00:06:28.950> it

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:29.160 
second yellow so for me like I can't it

00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.800 
second yellow so for me like I can't it
could<00:06:29.340> 110<00:06:29.760> go<00:06:29.910> either<00:06:30.120> where<00:06:30.420> I<00:06:30.450> see<00:06:30.690> why

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:30.810 
could 110 go either where I see why

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:33.350 
could 110 go either where I see why
hoses<00:06:31.200> would<00:06:31.350> be<00:06:31.410> upset<00:06:31.560> but<00:06:31.919> for<00:06:32.130> me<00:06:32.360> the

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 
hoses would be upset but for me the

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.240 
hoses would be upset but for me the
follow-through<00:06:33.750> I<00:06:34.350> don't<00:06:34.770> think<00:06:34.890> he<00:06:34.950> intended

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.250 
follow-through I don't think he intended

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:36.650 
follow-through I don't think he intended
to<00:06:35.400> hurt<00:06:35.610> him<00:06:35.910> but<00:06:36.060> the<00:06:36.180> way<00:06:36.330> over

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
to hurt him but the way over

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.000 
to hurt him but the way over
look<00:06:36.870> like<00:06:37.140> you<00:06:37.290> could<00:06:37.380> probably<00:06:37.560> see<00:06:37.800> way<00:06:37.950> to

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.010 
look like you could probably see way to

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.620 
look like you could probably see way to
raf<00:06:38.310> did<00:06:38.520> it<00:06:38.670> but<00:06:38.970> i<00:06:39.000> think<00:06:39.180> the<00:06:39.240> ref<00:06:39.420> had<00:06:39.510> the

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:39.630 
raf did it but i think the ref had the

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:41.210 
raf did it but i think the ref had the
absolute<00:06:39.750> shocker<00:06:40.380> all<00:06:40.650> night<00:06:40.860> really<00:06:41.130> though

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 
absolute shocker all night really though

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.090 
absolute shocker all night really though
as<00:06:41.340> many<00:06:41.550> times<00:06:42.150> we<00:06:42.330> screwed<00:06:42.690> up<00:06:42.840> I<00:06:43.110> still

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:44.100 
as many times we screwed up I still

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:45.440 
as many times we screwed up I still
understand<00:06:44.610> why<00:06:44.760> there<00:06:44.970> was<00:06:45.090> a<00:06:45.120> minute<00:06:45.390> of

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:45.450 
understand why there was a minute of

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:47.600 
understand why there was a minute of
extra<00:06:45.750> time<00:06:45.930> I<00:06:46.140> don't<00:06:46.860> really<00:06:47.100> remember<00:06:47.310> that

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:47.610 
extra time I don't really remember that

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:49.070 
extra time I don't really remember that
many<00:06:47.730> times<00:06:48.060> even<00:06:48.270> where<00:06:48.510> there's<00:06:48.660> been<00:06:48.810> again

many times even where there's been again

dentistry minutes they blow but he
didn't<00:06:53.340> do<00:06:53.430> it<00:06:53.580> but<00:06:53.730> you<00:06:54.480> know<00:06:54.510> that<00:06:54.810> I'm<00:06:55.230> not

to I'm not pissed off with the result
like<00:06:57.660> I<00:06:57.750> said<00:06:57.870> they<00:06:57.990> had<00:06:58.110> so<00:06:58.260> much<00:06:58.350> pressure

00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 
like I said they had so much pressure

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.650 
like I said they had so much pressure
towards<00:06:59.220> the<00:06:59.310> end<00:06:59.400> in<00:06:59.520> a<00:06:59.580> match<00:06:59.760> but<00:07:00.330> for<00:07:00.540> me

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:00.660 
towards the end in a match but for me

00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.690 
towards the end in a match but for me
there<00:07:01.050> were<00:07:01.140> so<00:07:01.530> many<00:07:01.800> positives<00:07:02.340> in<00:07:02.520> this

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:02.700 
there were so many positives in this

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.100 
there were so many positives in this
game<00:07:02.910> it's<00:07:03.060> a<00:07:03.120> fact<00:07:03.360> the<00:07:03.570> thing<00:07:03.750> that<00:07:03.900> we<00:07:03.960> got

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110

William<00:07:04.860> and<00:07:05.150> Samuel<00:07:06.150> Ethel<00:07:06.510> to<00:07:06.690> add<00:07:06.780> to<00:07:06.930> this

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:08.060 
William and Samuel Ethel to add to this
team<00:07:07.260> I<00:07:07.290> think<00:07:07.500> it's<00:07:07.590> going<00:07:07.650> to<00:07:07.740> be<00:07:07.830> a<00:07:07.860> great

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:08.070 
team I think it's going to be a great

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.040 
team I think it's going to be a great
season<00:07:08.400> for<00:07:08.550> charity<00:07:09.120> and<00:07:09.480> the<00:07:09.630> fact<00:07:09.870> that<00:07:09.930> we

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
season for charity and the fact that we

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.960 
season for charity and the fact that we
still<00:07:10.110> have<00:07:10.380> such<00:07:10.560> a<00:07:10.590> very<00:07:11.010> very<00:07:11.280> young<00:07:11.490> squad

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:11.970 
still have such a very very young squad

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:15.410 
still have such a very very young squad
you<00:07:12.900> know<00:07:13.020> I<00:07:13.050> think<00:07:13.470> it<00:07:13.650> was<00:07:13.800> a<00:07:14.030> really<00:07:15.030> good

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:15.420 
you know I think it was a really good

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:17.330 
you know I think it was a really good
performance<00:07:16.050> and<00:07:16.590> I<00:07:16.710> think<00:07:16.740> that<00:07:17.040> we<00:07:17.220> I<00:07:17.250> can't

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:17.340 
performance and I think that we I can't

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.130 
performance and I think that we I can't
afford<00:07:17.580> the<00:07:17.940> only<00:07:18.120> negative<00:07:18.510> that<00:07:18.750> we<00:07:18.840> really

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:19.140 
afford the only negative that we really

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:20.600 
afford the only negative that we really
did<00:07:19.290> is<00:07:19.380> that<00:07:19.410> we<00:07:19.590> didn't<00:07:19.890> win<00:07:19.980> but<00:07:20.220> like<00:07:20.490> i

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610 
did is that we didn't win but like i

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.940 
did is that we didn't win but like i
said<00:07:20.640> before<00:07:20.910> penalties<00:07:21.690> is<00:07:21.960> a<00:07:22.020> lottery<00:07:22.410> we

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:22.950 
said before penalties is a lottery we

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:24.320 
said before penalties is a lottery we
got<00:07:23.100> the<00:07:23.220> right<00:07:23.400> man<00:07:23.460> in<00:07:23.790> the<00:07:23.820> dressing<00:07:24.210> room
