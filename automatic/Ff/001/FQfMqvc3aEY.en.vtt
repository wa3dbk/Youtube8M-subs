00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
network I'm connected to I should be

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.350 
network I'm connected to I should be
connected<00:00:39.840> either<00:00:40.020> to<00:00:40.350> coach<00:00:40.680> or<00:00:41.129> to<00:00:41.850> geeks<00:00:42.120> on

tour<00:00:42.660> those<00:00:42.960> are<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.200> two<00:00:43.350> networks<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.980> I

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
tour those are the two networks that I

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.690 
tour those are the two networks that I
use<00:00:44.370> here<00:00:44.730> for<00:00:44.969> internet<00:00:45.300> but<00:00:45.960> look<00:00:46.140> at<00:00:46.260> this
