I<00:01:01.299> try<00:01:01.600> to<00:01:01.629> soften<00:01:02.019> a<00:01:02.260> little<00:01:02.290> bit<00:01:02.559> with<00:01:02.860> my

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
I try to soften a little bit with my

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.420 
I try to soften a little bit with my
electric<00:01:03.790> mixer<00:01:04.860> just<00:01:05.860> trying<00:01:06.100> to<00:01:06.159> make<00:01:06.280> it<00:01:06.400> a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
electric mixer just trying to make it a

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.750 
electric mixer just trying to make it a
little<00:01:06.520> bit<00:01:06.729> easier<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.060> work<00:01:07.210> with<00:01:07.420> and<00:01:08.760> then

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
little bit easier to work with and then

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.120 
little bit easier to work with and then
I<00:01:09.790> began<00:01:10.240> to<00:01:10.479> add<00:01:10.600> the<00:01:10.840> flour<00:01:11.170> baking<00:01:12.100> powder

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 
I began to add the flour baking powder

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.099 
I began to add the flour baking powder
and<00:01:12.609> salt<00:01:12.820> mixture<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.390> little<00:01:13.509> bit<00:01:13.869> at<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.020> time

00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:14.109 
and salt mixture a little bit at a time

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:18.029 
and salt mixture a little bit at a time
until<00:01:14.590> it<00:01:15.250> was<00:01:15.490> completely<00:01:15.850> combined<00:01:17.039> now

00:01:18.029 --> 00:01:18.039 
until it was completely combined now

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:20.039 
until it was completely combined now
this<00:01:18.310> is<00:01:18.520> a<00:01:18.549> challenge<00:01:18.939> and<00:01:19.390> I<00:01:19.509> did<00:01:19.689> use<00:01:19.869> my

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:20.049 
this is a challenge and I did use my

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:22.709 
this is a challenge and I did use my
electric<00:01:20.170> mixer<00:01:20.759> for<00:01:21.759> it<00:01:21.969> but<00:01:22.539> I<00:01:22.570> would

00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:22.719 
electric mixer for it but I would

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:24.510 
electric mixer for it but I would
probably<00:01:22.899> suggest<00:01:23.140> you<00:01:23.530> try<00:01:23.740> to<00:01:23.799> do<00:01:24.009> this<00:01:24.189> with

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
probably suggest you try to do this with

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.190 
probably suggest you try to do this with
a<00:01:24.549> wooden<00:01:24.850> spoon<00:01:25.210> unless<00:01:25.659> your<00:01:25.869> electric

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
a wooden spoon unless your electric

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.039 
a wooden spoon unless your electric
mixer<00:01:26.380> is<00:01:26.880> quite<00:01:27.880> strong<00:01:28.299> because<00:01:28.659> the<00:01:28.810> batter

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:29.049 
mixer is quite strong because the batter

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:31.109 
mixer is quite strong because the batter
that<00:01:29.619> you're<00:01:29.770> gonna<00:01:29.890> end<00:01:30.070> up<00:01:30.219> with<00:01:30.429> is<00:01:30.670> very

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
that you're gonna end up with is very

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:34.980 
that you're gonna end up with is very
very<00:01:31.929> thick<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:34.030> just<00:01:34.210> keep<00:01:34.420> blending<00:01:34.659> until

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
very thick so just keep blending until

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:37.620 
very thick so just keep blending until
it's<00:01:35.320> well<00:01:35.590> combined<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.490> then<00:01:37.390> you're<00:01:37.539> gonna

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:37.630 
it's well combined and then you're gonna

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.559 
it's well combined and then you're gonna
turn<00:01:37.869> this<00:01:38.079> out<00:01:38.289> into<00:01:38.590> a<00:01:38.829> greased<00:01:39.520> loaf<00:01:40.090> pan

00:01:40.559 --> 00:01:40.569 
turn this out into a greased loaf pan

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.940 
turn this out into a greased loaf pan
you<00:01:41.140> can<00:01:41.259> even<00:01:41.469> put<00:01:41.649> it<00:01:41.770> into<00:01:42.729> a<00:01:43.229> 8x8<00:01:44.229> inch<00:01:44.259> cake

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:44.950 
you can even put it into a 8x8 inch cake

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.190 
you can even put it into a 8x8 inch cake
pan<00:01:44.979> as<00:01:45.579> well<00:01:45.819> and<00:01:46.090> then<00:01:46.719> you're<00:01:46.840> gonna<00:01:46.960> bake

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
pan as well and then you're gonna bake

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.090 
pan as well and then you're gonna bake
this<00:01:47.409> at<00:01:47.679> 350<00:01:48.490> degrees<00:01:49.020> 40<00:01:50.020> to<00:01:50.200> 45<00:01:50.710> minutes
