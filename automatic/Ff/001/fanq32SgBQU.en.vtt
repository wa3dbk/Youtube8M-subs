00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.559
 hi player that today with box we go to 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.639
 cover an archery tutorial of the forge of 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.770
 halo 4 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.350
 if you don't know what it is we are 

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.950
 I understand the basics and later in the 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.300
 specific all things of the rifle 04 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.580
 therefore suitable to control others 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.680
 video if you haven't already done it today 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.900
 we will cover the turrets 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.289
 automatic because it is possible if not 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.460
 you know how to get it even outside 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:36.600
 of the domain mode as it is 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.359
 simply go to the menu 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:44.609
 of the domain options menu e 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:46.469
 click on the proven turret base that the 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:50.850
 spoon diamo simply press again 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:55.800
 hicks and put the defending team 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:58.409
 the defenders are the reds while 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.350
 strikers are blue this thing 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.239
 means that you can spawn 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.650
 use them for example also in the mode 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.960
 flowed could be a lot of fun 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.900
 that you make humans can have 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.030
 an extra defense though if you want it 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.040
 use the fraud mode 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.610
 you have to keep one thing in mind 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.900
 that the flowed mode actually is 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:25.860
 created in quotation marks common to all 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.540
 against all so if you have one 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.120
 turret with turret will work it 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.070
 only for those who have activated it 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.080
 so there could be could 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.490
 be of friendly fire as well as a 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.980
 flop killing against the flop 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.530
 so a very very simple thing but 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:48.030
 that can be really nice that you can 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.980
 have many many applications 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.380
 obviously you can decide how much there is 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.270
 puts the recovery time or how many 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.640
 seconds must pass before yes 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.220
 regenerates again is also the time of 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.960
 regeneration which is the same thing but 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.490
 for the whole tower for what it is 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.780
 answers for example at the beginning so on 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.200
 so a lot of recovery time 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:14.190
 important if you want it to regenerate 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:16.769
 have your tower created then 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.569
 for this tutorial it was everything 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.819
 stay tuned because they will arrive 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:24.950
 other halo 4 forge tutorials from 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.950
