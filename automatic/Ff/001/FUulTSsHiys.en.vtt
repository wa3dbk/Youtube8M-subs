00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.289 
thought in terms of its visual look and
its<00:01:42.990> layout<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.860> reminds<00:01:44.280> me<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.430> broadcast

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
its layout it reminds me of broadcast

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.660 
its layout it reminds me of broadcast
from<00:01:45.810> Call<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.140> Duty<00:01:46.500> 4<00:01:46.860> which<00:01:47.070> was<00:01:47.310> one<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.549> the

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
from Call of Duty 4 which was one of the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.389 
from Call of Duty 4 which was one of the
first<00:01:48.000> ever<00:01:48.299> Call<00:01:48.540> of<00:01:48.570> Duty<00:01:48.930> map<00:01:49.170> packs<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.740> of

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
first ever Call of Duty map packs and of

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.920 
first ever Call of Duty map packs and of
course<00:01:50.759> it<00:01:50.850> won't<00:01:50.909> be<00:01:51.030> identical<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:51.780> that's

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
course it won't be identical but that's

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.530 
course it won't be identical but that's
how<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.110> sort<00:01:52.350> of<00:01:52.409> see<00:01:52.710> it<00:01:52.799> looking<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
how I sort of see it looking and

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.060 
how I sort of see it looking and
actually<00:01:54.540> being<00:01:54.780> when<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.500> released<00:01:55.860> as<00:01:56.040> a

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
actually being when it is released as a

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.370 
actually being when it is released as a
multiplayer<00:01:56.520> map<00:01:56.729> for<00:01:57.000> black<00:01:57.210> ops<00:01:57.420> 2<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.049> that

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
multiplayer map for black ops 2 so that

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.510 
multiplayer map for black ops 2 so that
sounds<00:01:58.740> very<00:01:58.829> cool<00:01:59.159> indeed

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
sounds very cool indeed

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.219 
sounds very cool indeed
the<00:01:59.850> second<00:02:00.270> multiplayer<00:02:00.659> map<00:02:00.840> name<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.140> we

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
the second multiplayer map name that we

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.830 
the second multiplayer map name that we
know<00:02:01.350> so<00:02:01.560> far<00:02:01.860> vertigo<00:02:02.460> is<00:02:02.579> interesting<00:02:03.390> very

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
know so far vertigo is interesting very

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.170 
know so far vertigo is interesting very
interesting<00:02:04.079> indeed<00:02:04.680> first<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.579> all<00:02:05.640> vertical

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
interesting indeed first of all vertical

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.660 
interesting indeed first of all vertical
was<00:02:06.299> actually<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.960> spec<00:02:07.500> ops<00:02:07.710> mission<00:02:08.250> map<00:02:08.429> and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
was actually a spec ops mission map and

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.639 
was actually a spec ops mission map and
that<00:02:09.179> I<00:02:09.239> covered<00:02:09.569> on<00:02:09.660> my<00:02:09.750> channel<00:02:10.110> last<00:02:10.319> year

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
that I covered on my channel last year

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.949 
that I covered on my channel last year
for<00:02:10.830> modern<00:02:11.099> warfare<00:02:11.280> 3<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.879> was<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.060> DLC<00:02:12.629> spec

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
for modern warfare 3 it was a DLC spec

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.309 
for modern warfare 3 it was a DLC spec
ops

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
ops

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.050 
ops
mission<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:13.769> so<00:02:14.340> that's<00:02:14.489> interesting<00:02:14.969> it's

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
mission and so that's interesting it's

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.489 
mission and so that's interesting it's
already<00:02:15.299> been<00:02:15.420> used<00:02:15.689> within<00:02:15.900> modern<00:02:16.379> warfare

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:16.499 
already been used within modern warfare

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:19.670 
already been used within modern warfare
3<00:02:16.890> is<00:02:17.159> naming<00:02:17.459> but<00:02:18.090> it<00:02:18.359> was<00:02:18.480> also<00:02:18.719> a<00:02:18.959> cut<00:02:19.409> map

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
3 is naming but it was also a cut map

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.489 
3 is naming but it was also a cut map
for<00:02:20.249> modern<00:02:20.519> warfare<00:02:20.639> 2<00:02:21.079> multiplayer<00:02:22.079> as<00:02:22.200> well

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:22.499 
for modern warfare 2 multiplayer as well

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.349 
for modern warfare 2 multiplayer as well
which<00:02:22.680> is<00:02:22.799> even<00:02:23.010> more<00:02:23.159> interesting<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.849> it<00:02:24.209> was

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
which is even more interesting so it was

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.849 
which is even more interesting so it was
going<00:02:24.689> to<00:02:24.840> be<00:02:24.959> a<00:02:24.989> multiplayer<00:02:25.499> map<00:02:25.650> within

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
going to be a multiplayer map within

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.709 
going to be a multiplayer map within
modern<00:02:26.249> warfare<00:02:26.370> 2<00:02:26.549> but<00:02:26.879> was<00:02:26.969> never<00:02:27.239> used<00:02:27.510> if

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:27.719 
modern warfare 2 but was never used if

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.300 
modern warfare 2 but was never used if
you<00:02:27.780> look<00:02:27.959> on<00:02:28.079> at<00:02:28.319> the<00:02:28.439> image<00:02:28.620> on<00:02:28.769> screen<00:02:29.129> now

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
you look on at the image on screen now

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.550 
you look on at the image on screen now
it<00:02:29.459> looks<00:02:29.700> very<00:02:29.760> similar<00:02:30.269> to<00:02:30.389> high-rise<00:02:30.959> so<00:02:31.500> I

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
it looks very similar to high-rise so I

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.259 
it looks very similar to high-rise so I
assumed<00:02:31.950> that's<00:02:32.159> why<00:02:32.459> it<00:02:32.519> hasn't<00:02:32.790> been<00:02:33.030> used

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
assumed that's why it hasn't been used

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.929 
assumed that's why it hasn't been used
of<00:02:33.420> course<00:02:33.480> vertigo<00:02:34.200> is<00:02:35.099> something<00:02:35.549> high<00:02:35.730> up

00:02:35.929 --> 00:02:35.939 
of course vertigo is something high up

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:39.020 
of course vertigo is something high up
I'd<00:02:36.569> assume<00:02:36.989> to<00:02:37.170> be<00:02:37.319> a<00:02:37.349> map<00:02:38.219> on<00:02:38.459> top<00:02:38.790> of<00:02:38.909> a

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
I'd assume to be a map on top of a

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.300 
I'd assume to be a map on top of a
rooftop<00:02:39.269> or<00:02:39.689> something<00:02:40.169> similar<00:02:40.469> somewhere

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
rooftop or something similar somewhere

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.069 
rooftop or something similar somewhere
high<00:02:41.549> up<00:02:41.579> and<00:02:42.060> perhaps<00:02:42.359> you<00:02:42.480> can<00:02:42.629> fall<00:02:42.810> off<00:02:42.840> the

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:43.079 
high up and perhaps you can fall off the

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:44.629 
high up and perhaps you can fall off the
edges<00:02:43.230> of<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.620> map<00:02:43.799> you<00:02:44.189> know<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.430> kind<00:02:44.609> of

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:44.639 
edges of the map you know the kind of

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:46.129 
edges of the map you know the kind of
thing<00:02:44.790> you'd<00:02:44.909> expect<00:02:45.359> from<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.659> map<00:02:45.840> which<00:02:46.019> is

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
thing you'd expect from a map which is

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:47.270 
thing you'd expect from a map which is
high<00:02:46.349> up<00:02:46.500> in<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.799> sky

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
high up in the sky

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.699 
high up in the sky
similar<00:02:47.849> to<00:02:48.000> again<00:02:48.299> to<00:02:48.540> a<00:02:48.569> high-rise<00:02:49.049> in<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.590> way

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
similar to again to a high-rise in a way

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:50.690 
similar to again to a high-rise in a way
so<00:02:49.769> it's<00:02:49.950> gonna<00:02:50.040> be<00:02:50.129> interesting<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.579> see

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
so it's gonna be interesting to see

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.179 
so it's gonna be interesting to see
those<00:02:50.969> two<00:02:51.180> maps<00:02:51.389> of<00:02:51.569> course<00:02:51.840> I'd<00:02:52.260> expect<00:02:52.799> two

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:53.189 
those two maps of course I'd expect two

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:56.209 
those two maps of course I'd expect two
more<00:02:53.489> maps<00:02:53.730> to<00:02:53.909> be<00:02:54.000> coming<00:02:54.329> alongside<00:02:54.540> and<00:02:55.219> in

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:56.219 
more maps to be coming alongside and in

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:57.979 
more maps to be coming alongside and in
terms<00:02:56.609> of<00:02:56.730> multiplayer<00:02:57.150> maps<00:02:57.359> as<00:02:57.510> well<00:02:57.540> once

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
terms of multiplayer maps as well once

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.140 
terms of multiplayer maps as well once
the<00:02:58.139> information<00:02:58.379> and<00:02:58.919> images<00:02:59.310> of<00:02:59.459> those<00:02:59.879> I'll

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
the information and images of those I'll

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:01.759 
the information and images of those I'll
let<00:03:00.389> you<00:03:00.510> guys<00:03:00.750> know<00:03:01.109> in<00:03:01.260> terms<00:03:01.469> of<00:03:01.620> sort<00:03:01.739> of

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
let you guys know in terms of sort of
