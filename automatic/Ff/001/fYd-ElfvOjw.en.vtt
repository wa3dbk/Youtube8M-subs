00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.990
 the faculty of sciences of the cdeee 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.550
 Medellin seeks to provide support to all 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.980
 young people who are in the process of 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.629
 choose a career for this 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.159
 reason offers them the testimony of the 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.249
 graduates of their engineering programs 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:40.949
 physics biological engineering math 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:43.289
 and statistics today we find ourselves with 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:45.359
 Laura Osorno graduated from the program 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.420
 biological engineering who will speak to us 

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:49.829
 of his work in the labor field in the 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.159
 now I'm finishing is the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.989
 expertise and as I told them work is with 

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.149
 soil microbiology and work as 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.370
 the microorganisms that are in the 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.949
 soil can help growth and 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.050
 plant development then these 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.110
 microorganisms what they do 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.200
 it's just using materials that have 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.090
 phosphorus used in the industry 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.100
 of agriculture as fertilizers 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.900
 but this dessert is in this 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.280
 fertilizer is very little soluble before 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.680
 of these microorganisms what they do is 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.110
 just use that match and so that 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.550
 phosphorus can get easier to 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.490
 plants that we do with 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.080
 microorganisms and has many advantages 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.940
 between the advantage is that there is not so much 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:33.420
 pollution to the environment by 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.910
 fertilizer production and also the 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.950
 Another advantage is that by not using both 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.200
 fertilizer then the 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.750
 costs for example for the 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.640
 farmers biological engineering 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.920
 Medellin link offers a great 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.930
 deepening variety is where 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.180
 you can play students and 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.170
 graduates of this career we know 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.960
 some of these deepening is 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.780
 and biological is an interesting career 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.060
 for what it said because it couples the part 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.009
 of engineering with the biological part 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.130
 then of a race that ends 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.380
 being very transversal to other careers 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.600
 then for example is the area of 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.160
 decontamination can work in 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.900
 waters in certain air soils of 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.269
 decontamination with microorganisms 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:23.420
 true stationary there is another large area 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:26.330
 of processes processes with microorganisms 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.670
 for product formation 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.050
 products that products for 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.480
 chemical industry I do not know how a 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.100
 biopolymer for example in the industry 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.870
 of food there are many foods that 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:39.160
 produced by microorganisms such as 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.810
 part of the beer fermentation wine 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.450
 cheese production and so on in the 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.610
 part of medicine is also worked 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.069
 a lot with microorganisms production of 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.840
 antibiotics there is also a large 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:53.480
 amount of microorganisms that have not yet 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.830
 you know there is also the part 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.360
 molecular 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.330
 biological engineering also has that 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.490
 part and there are a lot of other areas 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.380
 example in which I am performing 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.800
 is in the microbiology part of the 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.640
 soil then like microorganisms 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.890
 help for example growth 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.870
 plant growth of plants 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.060
 but you could also work on other 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.720
 areas like for example bio control of 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.550
 diseases in plants then 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.710
 biological engineering has a lot of 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.410
 alternatives can work in a 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.750
 lots of areas where they can 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.550
 apply the microorganisms the 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.380
 University encourages and favors 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.959
 processes that are carried out with 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.030
 dedication and international internships 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:37.370
 are one of these stimuli that can be 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:41.540
 achieve with responsible work and 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.190
 committed something important and something that 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.800
 It can be very enriching for a 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.680
 researcher is that the university has 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.890
 possibilities of doing internships and power 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.870
 go and know or be other labs 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.060
 other universities other institutes in 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.640
 you can interact with people who 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.350
 He knows a lot about a certain subject and you too 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.090
 You can go teach what you do in 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:04.430
 the 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:06.140
 thanks to the expertise of the 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.840
 research that has been developing 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.300
 and the support of my thesis director the 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.450
 doctor walter osorio I can do my 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:16.370
 internship at the University of Hawaii and 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.160
 there to be able to work with others 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.530
 microorganisms that are called 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.630
 mycorrhizae and with them you can already 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:25.699
 perform new research and 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.080
 come here and here at the university 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:29.080
 apply all knowledge 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.820
 to work in a laboratory as 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:38.710
 we do most of the media 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.080
 biologicals obviously you have to follow 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.910
 Certain true biosafety regulations 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.700
 one of them for example is the use 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:48.520
 of water is always mandatory 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.310
 between work inside the laboratory as well 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:54.340
 As I put on the robe we take off the 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:57.190
 accessories we always have a very 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.710
 aseptic we work with equipment that we 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.230
 help to fulfill that asepsis is for 

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:05.140
 example we work in always with camera 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:08.530
 of flow the flow chamber allows 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.750
 there is not so much pollution and that 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.940
 let's have an aseptic work environment 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.890
 depending on the type of microorganism 

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.410
 with which we work, changes the way 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.450
 to cultivate the truth is different to 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:21.250
 work with bacteria to work with 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:23.470
 mushrooms and among them also them 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.850
 they can present true differences 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.650
 then one has to know very well 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:29.050
 the microorganism with which he works 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.720
 to know what culture medium 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.680
 I use what temperature conditions 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.960
 requires what 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.720
 customers requires if for example 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:40.030
 present competition with others true 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:43.090
 There are many factors to consider that I 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.240
 I need to have the culture medium 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:48.400
 microorganism and then like any 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.740
 organism has to have a time for 

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:53.110
 that grow then during that time 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.539
 We always use an incubator with 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:58.270
 a controlled temperature so that the 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:00.729
 microorganism can grow for 

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:02.470
 time you can work so much in er lee 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:04.990
 myers that would be the coves of 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:08.050
 laboratory or already industrially already 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.210
 can work in reactors or batteries 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:11.620
 of reactors for example where I like 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.289
 similar to those that occur 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.610
 true beer or wine or any 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:18.630
 another fermentation that is also 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.630
 produced by microorganisms
