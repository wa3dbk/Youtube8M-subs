00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
they do a great job so for any given

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.960 
they do a great job so for any given
feature<00:01:52.470> that<00:01:52.860> will<00:01:53.130> have<00:01:53.369> in<00:01:53.490> development<00:01:53.910> at

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
feature that will have in development at

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.639 
feature that will have in development at
any<00:01:54.090> given<00:01:54.390> point<00:01:54.630> I'm<00:01:55.110> looking<00:01:55.440> at<00:01:55.560> that

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
any given point I'm looking at that

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.520 
any given point I'm looking at that
feature<00:01:55.920> at<00:01:56.850> a<00:01:57.210> broad<00:01:57.509> stroke<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.170> how<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.410> will

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
feature at a broad stroke of how it will

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.800 
feature at a broad stroke of how it will
work<00:01:58.560> with<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.009> rest<00:01:59.190> of<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.460> game<00:01:59.670> so<00:02:00.509> if<00:02:00.690> you

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
work with the rest of the game so if you

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.910 
work with the rest of the game so if you
take<00:02:01.110> something<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> killstreak

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
take something like a killstreak

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.100 
take something like a killstreak
development<00:02:02.610> effort

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
development effort

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.410 
development effort
I'll<00:02:03.740> go<00:02:03.980> through<00:02:04.370> and<00:02:04.610> look<00:02:05.060> at<00:02:05.150> the<00:02:05.240> feature

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
I'll go through and look at the feature

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.380 
I'll go through and look at the feature
at<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.840> 360<00:02:06.770> degree<00:02:06.860> angle<00:02:07.370> so<00:02:07.610> what<00:02:08.179> does<00:02:08.270> it

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.390 
at a 360 degree angle so what does it

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.749 
at a 360 degree angle so what does it
like<00:02:08.509> to<00:02:08.630> play<00:02:08.869> what<00:02:09.619> are<00:02:09.740> the<00:02:09.800> controls<00:02:10.220> one

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
like to play what are the controls one

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.430 
like to play what are the controls one
is<00:02:10.880> it<00:02:10.970> sound<00:02:11.240> like<00:02:11.450> how<00:02:11.930> is<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:12.230> art

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
is it sound like how is the art

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.220 
is it sound like how is the art
impacting<00:02:13.130> that<00:02:13.310> and<00:02:13.580> most<00:02:14.090> importantly<00:02:14.600> how

impacting that and most importantly how

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.590 
impacting that and most importantly how
that<00:02:15.650> feature<00:02:16.040> impacts<00:02:16.760> other<00:02:16.940> features<00:02:17.420> in

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.949 
could actually run around and fire one
from<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.450> hip<00:02:57.520> so<00:02:58.520> what<00:02:58.670> we<00:02:58.760> did<00:02:58.880> was<00:02:58.959> to

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
from the hip so what we did was to

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.210 
from the hip so what we did was to
settle<00:03:00.200> the<00:03:00.290> argument<00:03:00.410> is<00:03:00.739> we<00:03:00.890> went<00:03:01.040> out<00:03:01.130> to

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
crap out of it with a big hammer and

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.670 
crap out of it with a big hammer and
then<00:03:56.330> I<00:03:56.420> think<00:03:56.480> he<00:03:56.750> mixed<00:03:57.019> that<00:03:57.080> with<00:03:57.170> celery

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680
