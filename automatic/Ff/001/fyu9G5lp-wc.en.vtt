00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.960
 well here we are always honda stand 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:16.289
 see the hrc logo on this one 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.759
 cbr1000rr fireblade sps track for sports 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.130
 production let's see it more from 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.439
 close and see what changes in this 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.810
 model compared to the cousin you see 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.689
 that you saw in the previous video 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.579
 well first we have already seen the 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.979
 rc place then it is a way a 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:35.460
 sorry model derived from the world of 

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:36.930
 ran a 1000 that stays with the 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.530
 fireblade features that 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.329
 we have already seen therefore 181 horses and 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.070
 114 Newton meters of torque was worked 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.350
 on the engine in particular on the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.160
 control unit to get a result 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.230
 better in mid-range then more more 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.660
 dispensing more fluidity 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.820
 from this point of view compared to 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.949
 basic version obviously also changes the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.730
 here we have ohlins forks 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.590
 on the front 43 mm adjustable in all 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.900
 what you want back instead 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:12.420
 we have an adjustable mono ttx36 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.510
 you also see is and meanwhile passes 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.280
 the framing of the various details 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.170
 braking department provided by brembo now 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.090
 brembo and ohlins are the masters a 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.270
 this echo but 2013 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.410
 also this case we have pins and on 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:28.140
 on the front monobloc caliper a 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.630
 four pistons with the difference that 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.610
 compared to the normal fireblade 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.310
 we have compound tablets 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.690
 best designed for use even in 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.910
 track 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.340
 other changes we can see here the 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.670
 platforms have been set back by 10 mm 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.470
 compared to the basic version version 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.390
 poor other changes we have the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.830
 steering plates with the tube in 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.770
 steel and some other small 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.050
 detail the weight is really filed 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.760
 very lightly instead of 200 kg 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.010
 we have 100 99 kg the merit is here merit 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.740
 and here in this section we have the 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.840
 fireblade sp which is single seater 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:09.300
 so it will come standard with the cover 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.630
 the roe will be the passenger 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.540
 obviously the kilo saved is 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.180
 no longer having the under-saddle frame 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.800
 who was going to hold the weight 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.020
 of the passenger 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.130
 let's take a quick look also 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.360
 to the instrumentation we see 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.790
 digital instrumentation 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.880
 we also see the steering plates 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.360
 mirror controls and with the honda 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:36.280
 cbr1000rr fireblade spies all greetings to 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.280
