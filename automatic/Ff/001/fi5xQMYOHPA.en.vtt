00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:14.400
 hi today I present two flashes of the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.880
 the same manufacturer the longo e 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.869
 different only for a very small 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.539
 particular 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.160
 then let's start immediately to say that 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.949
 I have been using the y en 565 ex for some time 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:35.160
 taken 1 time ago in China 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:37.649
 they work for a few months and broke 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.430
 to which I said I refer the accessory to 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:43.739
 China and I will be returned no even though 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:47.129
 I saved something then I lost 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.870
 in the say in the expedition why the 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:53.190
 shipping of the state for 30 euros only 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:56.670
 to send the flash near hong kong 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.160
 in short, the money I had saved 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.739
 because it came to 140 euros 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.799
 I think the money I had from China 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.659
 saved I lost it with with the 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:11.130
 shipping but above all the 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.430
 producer is a little bit 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.280
 indeed the seller is not the manufacturer yes 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.320
 he acted marine because he did n't 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.240
 said the flash hadn't arrived with 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.479
 all with everything I had 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.189
 received in hand etc. and so on e 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.650
 so he never sent this back to me 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.470
 so great accessory I had to 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.140
 buy it again this time conscious of the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.860
 fact that I will not buy more accessories a 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:39.990
 less expensive like those in china i 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.880
 taken from an Italian seller two 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.920
 days and a half I got the flash 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.930
 so I didn't have to wait 20 days 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.530
 like the first time it cost me 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.960
 a little more and what 800 180 euros 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.479
 but I was happy because in addition to 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.869
 having turned out to be a great purchase like 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.759
 initially I also have a warranty eo 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.439
 the seller in italy so at the most 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.960
 I'm going to pick it up again 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.200
 Jokes aside 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.670
 since in any case I needed two 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.500
 I decided to buy the same flash 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.330
 investing in the new version 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.310
 new version that we talk about 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.610
 clearly it costs about 10 euros more 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:23.180
 and that is the 568 and hicks the difference 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.130
 between these two versions before before 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.060
 talk let's say aesthetics the 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:34.940
 aesthetic difference is purely one 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:38.780
 that is, the 56 8 supports high speed 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:41.180
 sync therefore supports more speed 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.709
 high that it seems to me that it is an 8 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.100
 thousandth of a second with yours 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.100
 camera 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.330
 oh God serves and does not serve in the sense that 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:53.780
 it depends on what use you make of it 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:56.269
 reflex at 70 80 percent of you think 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:03:00.260
 which you won't need then if you want 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:04.430
 invest in a flash a little newer 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.670
 we say that 56 8 is the one of the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.910
 choices I repeat the difference is this 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.650
 so violate I wanted to try both 

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.660
 also to understand if there were differences 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:19.850
 but there are not only this high 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:22.180
 let's see speed sync more closely 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.180
 then 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:30.080
 here they are as you can see the difference is 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:34.250
 not even so much in the arrangement of the 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.830
 keys that are more or less the same 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.430
 something they put year change of 

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:43.250
 but on off keys to this is ours 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.760
 there is that other light both 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.810
 practically at the same time 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:50.330
 the only thing they put in the most is 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.550
 a bit prettier this tune 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:55.040
 makes a beep a bit aggressive though me 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.200
 however I remove the pips so in 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.019
 both cases would be 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:08.060
 gone I do not care either of 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:17.630
 no jingle or beeping if we want 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:18.890
 to a two led for the help of the fire 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.680
 automatic to catch fire 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:28.970
 automatic faster a little powerful 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:32.750
 this actually only has the ce grid 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.000
 he also these eventually these 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.220
 two more LEDs that help but not more than 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.890
 so let's say that in the end if taken 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.400
 in with flash often and willingly 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:47.240
 use the manual fire then the 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:48.950
 attack this new one to just the attack 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:56.210
 small then only the new attack 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:05:00.949
 this old one also has 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:03.020
 if I can open it to both 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:09.849
 always old attacks 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:14.930
 ok the course of the night have both 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:20.690
 both the diffuser and the cardboard that 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:26.770
 this and both arrive with one 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:30.080
 very practical case worthy of the name 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:32.650
 with support to keep upright 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.650
 the flash 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:42.620
 here are our two flashes 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:44.960
 then again this was a fast one 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:48.020
 comparative to try to understand which ones 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:51.880
 were the differences between version 5 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:51.880
 6 5 and version 5 6 8 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.780
 if you ask me which one to buy well 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:59.449
 it depends on you in the sense that if you want 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:02.690
 spend 10 15 euros more purchased on 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:03.080
 56 8 this costs around 170 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.490
 EUR 

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:11.120
 this arrives 685 I remind you that this 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.669
 flash possesses practically everything is the 

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:16.270
 top of the flash just does not know is not 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:19.820
 master so we have to manage 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.830
 possibly with flash triggers 

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:27.440
 of the camera or if you have the 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:30.259
 possibility through this pop up 

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:32.930
 these are the two flashes 

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:34.070
 if you have any questions you can ask me 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.740
 in the comments 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:39.430
 I'm starting this new one 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:43.130
 part of the video reviews so I don't know 

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:45.650
 how many of you may be interested if 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.690
 you have questions do in the pure ways 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.050
 comments and we will be in touch soon 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:50.050
 next
