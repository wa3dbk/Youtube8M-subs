because I wanted to be able to have a
few<00:00:32.009> fixed<00:00:32.340> pins<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:32.820> hunting<00:00:33.239> in<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
few fixed pins for hunting in the

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.060 
few fixed pins for hunting in the
whitetail<00:00:33.720> woods<00:00:33.960> and<00:00:34.200> then<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.770> wanted<00:00:34.980> to

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
whitetail woods and then I wanted to

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.440 
whitetail woods and then I wanted to
have<00:00:35.190> something<00:00:35.399> that<00:00:35.520> could<00:00:35.730> dial<00:00:35.970> in<00:00:36.180> out<00:00:36.300> to

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
have something that could dial in out to

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.930 
have something that could dial in out to
long<00:00:36.630> range<00:00:37.040> not<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.190> much<00:00:38.340> just<00:00:38.370> for<00:00:38.700> hunting

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940

back<00:00:43.890> out<00:00:44.100> quite<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> ways<00:00:44.489> and<00:00:44.760> get<00:00:45.450> some<00:00:45.600> fine

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
back out quite a ways and get some fine

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.050 
back out quite a ways and get some fine
tuning<00:00:45.809> in<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.610> sight<00:00:47.820> really

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.060 
tuning in so the the sight really

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:52.880 
tuning in so the the sight really
appealed<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> me<00:00:49.260> in<00:00:49.440> that<00:00:49.620> aspect<00:00:51.380> the<00:00:52.380> the

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
appealed to me in that aspect the the

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.790 
appealed to me in that aspect the the
sights<00:00:53.730> drive<00:00:54.330> system<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.080> believe<00:00:55.200> is<00:00:55.680> this

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
sights drive system I believe is this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.460 
sights drive system I believe is this
top<00:00:56.040> notch<00:00:56.310> it's<00:00:57.270> got<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> lock<00:00:57.690> down<00:00:57.930> screw

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
top notch it's got a lock down screw

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.840 
top notch it's got a lock down screw
over<00:00:58.740> here<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.220> flip<00:00:59.490> it<00:00:59.579> with<00:00:59.730> your

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
over here you just flip it with your

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.210 
over here you just flip it with your
finger<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.690> everything's<00:01:01.290> very<00:01:01.500> real<00:01:01.920> easy

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
finger and everything's very real easy

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.469 
finger and everything's very real easy
to<00:01:02.370> get<00:01:02.610> to<00:01:02.670> and<00:01:03.120> adjust<00:01:04.820> so<00:01:05.820> that's<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.180> good

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
to get to and adjust so that's a good

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.140 
to get to and adjust so that's a good

the site was shipped to me the pins and

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.310 
the site was shipped to me the pins and
that<00:01:24.180> weren't<00:01:24.420> lined<00:01:24.630> up<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.990> straight<00:01:25.290> line

I<00:01:25.530> had<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.860> actually<00:01:26.100> bend<00:01:26.520> them<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:26.700> get<00:01:27.000> them

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 
I had to actually bend them to get them

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.539 
I had to actually bend them to get them
in<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.270> straight<00:01:27.540> line<00:01:27.860> which<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.190> know<00:01:29.280> in<00:01:29.430> the

you can dial it out to long range and
also<00:02:08.159> -<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.519> can<00:02:08.640> really<00:02:08.909> micro<00:02:09.299> adjust<00:02:09.659> all

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
also - you can really micro adjust all

the windage and all your settings so on
a<00:02:13.080> scale<00:02:13.230> of<00:02:13.379> one<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:13.709> ten<00:02:14.010> if<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.400> pins

a scale of one to ten if the pins

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.530 
a scale of one to ten if the pins
weren't<00:02:14.939> the<00:02:15.000> way<00:02:15.090> they<00:02:15.239> were<00:02:15.330> and<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
weren't the way they were and the

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.940 
weren't the way they were and the
hardware<00:02:15.840> wasn't<00:02:16.260> like<00:02:16.379> that<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.739> know<00:02:16.830> I'd

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
hardware wasn't like that you know I'd

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.240 
hardware wasn't like that you know I'd
give<00:02:17.400> it<00:02:17.519> an<00:02:17.580> easy<00:02:17.760> nine<00:02:18.060> but<00:02:18.530> with<00:02:19.530> the

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
give it an easy nine but with the

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.190 
give it an easy nine but with the
material<00:02:20.760> know<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.269> the<00:02:21.450> craftsmanship<00:02:21.750> and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
material know and the craftsmanship and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.319 
material know and the craftsmanship and
them<00:02:22.319> pins<00:02:22.620> I<00:02:22.859> bump<00:02:23.549> it<00:02:23.639> down<00:02:23.669> to<00:02:23.939> a<00:02:23.969> six

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:24.329 
them pins I bump it down to a six

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.050 
them pins I bump it down to a six
because<00:02:24.510> for<00:02:25.139> a<00:02:25.169> 200<00:02:25.620> site<00:02:25.859> $200<00:02:26.579> site<00:02:26.879> you

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
because for a 200 site $200 site you

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.800 
because for a 200 site $200 site you
should<00:02:27.209> be<00:02:27.269> able<00:02:27.359> to<00:02:27.450> have

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
should be able to have

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.949 
should be able to have
not<00:02:28.050> CH<00:02:28.640> material<00:02:29.640> and<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.480> far<00:02:30.690> what<00:02:30.870> I've

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
not CH material and so far what I've

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.420 
not CH material and so far what I've
seen<00:02:31.140> on<00:02:31.200> this<00:02:31.440> site<00:02:31.680> it<00:02:31.830> just<00:02:31.860> doesn't<00:02:32.310> have

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
seen on this site it just doesn't have

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.640
