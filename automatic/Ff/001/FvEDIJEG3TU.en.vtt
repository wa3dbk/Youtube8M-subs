00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:08.390
 Mirrorless one eye g with lumix 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.260
 We will introduce 6 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:16.460
 In this it is the body 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:19.550
 When was 2 Ha of Yes in this Gafutaana will be along to another common 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:24.680
 But it is coco That lens is round 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:31.760
 We stretched the day-to-day peach how together and I I rounded protector 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:33.200
 In that Bali I'd quite a commonplace anymore it is as a characteristic of this of gf 6 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.200
 I will try the angle 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.910
 So like this 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.240
 You can also take a selfie and after all this is how it looks like it has grown considerably 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:47.100
 Because 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:49.930
 High you can see doing this, such as when you want to shoot from the top that 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.860
 The You're easy when the fix in 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:57.270
 This is that 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.610
 As there is also an intelligent auto button with a mode dial attached here 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.120
 In can be switched by that defeat Honbo is 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:09.380
 Is it the size of here it looks roughly 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:14.960
 1,040,000 of 3 types are so 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:17.050
 That this in but the image quality itself'm a person reel if there is around so I 1600 cartoon Is 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:21.730
 Of course that 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.760
 It does not maybe what whether fate has become to be able to be housed here 330 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:28.109
 It seems that you can get around 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:31.940
 What is that iso 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:35.180
 Can be raised to 25600 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.230
 And of course that camera 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.659
 Supports touch panel 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:46.590
 Because 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:47.900
 It is also possible to operate the weight on this screen is roughly 420 grams out in this state now 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:54.470
 It is about 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:58.900
 It's 420 grams with the lens, battery and sd card in it. 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:06.270
 I wonder if it will come a little bit 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:10.679
 Because I yes no until there it is that too much is the place with the It is after here jetty 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:16.010
 It is there may be a feeling Na squid Nick using it is a little, depending on the person 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:21.079
 It has a function lever so you can zoom in here 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:23.800
 You can also change the white balance etc. After that, this lens is an electrically powered lens 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:28.980
 Here Because there 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:32.569
 You can also zoom that function key day 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.249
 You can do everything Yes 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.930
 It is this that is normal Motorized zoom It is normal that there is that lens, but there 

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:43.360
 If it is a lens lens 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:47.470
 Of course, when I zoom on that, I'll be teaching this, but 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:51.400
 This function lever is basically this 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:54.940
 It seems that you can only use lenses that support the power zoom 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.990
 Lens that is attached to there but I have a setting that say double Tit to Another 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:59.530
 I see 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:05.020
 Function lever itself also has and will not a Ano 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:05.950
 It seems that you can not do it. It 's a well-known government function lever. 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.490
 range 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:13.130
 If you like electric zoom like this 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:17.540
 It is in pretty quickly I think that is good for both of the lens in but I know this started to feel 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.890
 According to the homepage, it seems to be 0.5 seconds 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.640
 here 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:25.510
 ON OFF Try the wearing of 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:30.670
 Well, I guess this one second isn't wrong anymore 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:33.080
 In Because it is a built-in I think you flash the dolphins there in about 0.5 seconds 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:35.760
 So if you do here , that 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.450
 You get a flash 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:43.970
 It is this flash- 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:45.019
 You can move it so you can move it upwards and bounce it, etc. 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:51.790
 I can do it 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:56.209
 So it's quite easy to use but it's just a bit so that the making itself is quite delicate 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:59.260
 I think it is better not to move too much, but if you 're bad I cut it a bit 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.260
 I also feel like going 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:11.830
 Because this gf 6 is so with this battery charger usually 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:17.269
 The battery can be charged by inserting it in this place and plugging it into an electrical outlet . 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:23.110
 It Is What I can say that I thought that it is try yourself Te point where I thought the finished 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:27.550
 It's a bit hard to hold , so after all this is 420g 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:32.319
 It is somewhat it is and become muffled to the normal I Yappa this little 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:38.259
 Of course, this way I'd run away firm is feeling going to be something like this in such a 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:40.009
 Sony's is that nex 5 r or plabelt too, but it's a bit hard to carry 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:44.509
 There may be 

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:49.699
 External microphone and external finder and fraud and switch 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:51.169
 It was a bit disappointing because I can not turn it on like this remote switch. 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:55.819
 It is felt on? 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:05:00.030
 っ 超 超 lum lum ル lum Panasonic Lumix gf 6 of that lumix 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:05:04.590
 It is compact, but it becomes one eye mirrorless one eye 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.900
 As now with this year I finder is to this Well I'd come out in June 2013 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.380
 There is a thing called g 6 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:14.270
 It already looks completely 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:16.610
 It feels like a single-lens reflex camera Of course the viewfinder is also attached and attached 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:20.780
 You can also attach a microphone 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:25.340
 Yes, I think that what put towards the remote installation from the sky 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:32.120
 Anyway, those who want that finder I need a little external microphone 

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:35.420
 In addition, it is a mirrorless little compact, and the shape like a single lens reflex is good. 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:39.280
 If you say that 's g 6 say 

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:39.280
 I highly recommend things
