00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
so I guess I'm gonna spec it up on a

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.240 
so I guess I'm gonna spec it up on a
shade<00:01:02.449> never<00:01:03.449> done<00:01:04.229> this<00:01:04.409> before<00:01:04.619> but<00:01:05.100> it's

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
shade never done this before but it's

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.980
