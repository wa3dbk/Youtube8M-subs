00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
the left of this of 20 pixels this goes

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.210 
the left of this of 20 pixels this goes
only<00:03:50.220> to<00:03:50.780> 960<00:03:51.780> grid<00:03:51.810> premise<00:03:52.410> each<00:03:52.620> grid<00:03:53.070> is

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
it's going to be 1 10 6 50 200 which

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.290 
it's going to be 1 10 6 50 200 which
adds<00:04:57.230> up<00:04:57.560> to<00:04:57.590> 9<00:04:57.920> 60s<00:04:58.610> I<00:04:58.790> just<00:04:58.940> want<00:04:59.090> to<00:04:59.120> share

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
adds up to 9 60s I just want to share

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.240 
adds up to 9 60s I just want to share
this<00:04:59.540> with<00:04:59.660> you<00:04:59.810> so<00:05:00.290> they<00:05:00.560> have<00:05:00.710> tagged<00:05:00.920> except

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
this with you so they have tagged except

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.790 
this with you so they have tagged except
the<00:05:01.370> 70<00:05:01.760> pixels<00:05:02.120> wide<00:05:02.330> plus<00:05:02.990> 20<00:05:03.380> pixels<00:05:03.680> of

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
the 70 pixels wide plus 20 pixels of

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.920 
the 70 pixels wide plus 20 pixels of
padding<00:05:03.830> so<00:05:04.700> 70<00:05:05.210> to<00:05:05.360> the<00:05:05.450> left<00:05:05.660> to<00:05:05.810> the<00:05:05.840> right

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
padding so 70 to the left to the right

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.860 
padding so 70 to the left to the right
so<00:05:06.410> it's<00:05:06.530> left<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:07.010> right<00:05:07.160> is<00:05:07.400> 40<00:05:07.850> 40<00:05:08.390> plus<00:05:08.570> 7

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:08.870 
so it's left and right is 40 40 plus 7

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.040 
so it's left and right is 40 40 plus 7
is<00:05:08.990> 110<00:05:09.620> ok<00:05:10.430> then<00:05:10.970> I<00:05:11.210> screwed<00:05:11.660> up<00:05:11.720> on<00:05:11.930> the

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
time my apologies so this is set to

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.960 
time my apologies so this is set to
let's<00:05:19.820> do<00:05:19.970> the<00:05:20.090> math<00:05:20.120> so<00:05:20.810> this<00:05:20.960> is<00:05:21.110> set<00:05:21.320> to<00:05:21.970> it

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
let's do the math so this is set to it

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.040 
let's do the math so this is set to it
want<00:05:23.360> to<00:05:23.480> make<00:05:23.630> this<00:05:23.780> 650<00:05:24.470> so<00:05:24.980> is<00:05:25.250> 650<00:05:26.050> minus

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
want to make this 650 so is 650 minus

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.270 
want to make this 650 so is 650 minus
the<00:05:27.560> padding<00:05:28.130> here<00:05:28.370> is<00:05:28.550> 40<00:05:29.210> s<00:05:29.270> minus<00:05:29.800> 40<00:05:30.800> which

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
the padding here is 40 s minus 40 which

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.010 
the padding here is 40 s minus 40 which
gives<00:05:31.520> a<00:05:31.610> sixth<00:05:31.970> n<00:05:32.180> minus<00:05:33.020> 20<00:05:33.440> to<00:05:33.590> the<00:05:33.740> left

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
gives a sixth n minus 20 to the left

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:38.710 
gives a sixth n minus 20 to the left
2-24<00:05:36.020> the<00:05:36.140> lap<00:05:36.350> that<00:05:37.010> because<00:05:37.220> this<00:05:37.510> 590<00:05:38.510> and
