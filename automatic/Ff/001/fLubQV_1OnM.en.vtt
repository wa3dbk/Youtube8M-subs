 My name is Julie, I'm 9 years old, during the hundred years war did people know how to write? 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.640
 Hello Julie and hello to the little man who is locked up in his prison, at the very top 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.349
 of the castle ! 

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:24.430
 To answer your question, yes and no. In fact, there were the rich on one side, 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.590
 the nobles, the lords, etc., and the poor on the other, mainly peasants. 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.149
 Charlemagne had invented the school, but it was not compulsory. Of 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.579
 the rich could afford to give an education to their children, and 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.719
 so to teach them how to read and write and the poor, well most of the time 

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.210
 children learned the job of parents to help them on the farm, for example. 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.969
 Moreover, it was quite difficult to have paper to write on it since it was 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.329
 still a little expensive. 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.640
 Before the 13th century besides, there are also few noble and rich who know 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.559
 write and read. It is mostly monks who write on scrolls. 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:03.679
 But here we are talking about the hundred years war that takes place from 1337 to 1453 between France 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:04.580
 and England. 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.729
 At that time everyone can not write but there is already progress. By 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.310
 For example, women artisans often write to help their husbands run the business. 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.090
 On the other hand in the peasants it is still not it eh. 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:20.670
 But, above all, one thing is that during the 100 years war we do not go 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.770
 much progress in teaching writing. In fact for 5 years between 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.149
 1347 and 1352, so in full war of 100 years ago there is the famous epidemic of plague 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.880
 black throughout Europe. After 5 years it is about â…“ of the population 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.549
 dies and whose teachers, teachers too. So there are fewer teachers, he 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.920
 There is less time for study because you have to fight during the war. Farmers 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.659
 it's even worse because to make war you need money and so we tax 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.789
 the peasants who must work even more to succeed in paying them. And so they 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.590
 are forced to work with their children who do not learn to write ... 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.409
 So yes there are people who knew how to write, very well even but the majority of the population 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.009
 did not know, simply.
