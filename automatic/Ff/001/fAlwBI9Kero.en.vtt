00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
syncope is a loss of consciousness

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.059 
syncope is a loss of consciousness
caused<00:02:44.360> by<00:02:44.599> a<00:02:44.630> sudden<00:02:44.959> drop<00:02:45.319> in<00:02:45.380> heart<00:02:45.769> rate

common cause of fainting so he had a

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.809 
common cause of fainting so he had a
combination<00:02:50.360> of<00:02:51.019> pots<00:02:51.890> postural<00:02:52.640> tachycardia

syncope and that combination is is quite

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.270 
syncope and that combination is is quite
common<00:02:59.329> after<00:02:59.569> the<00:02:59.959> diagnosis<00:03:00.650> treatment

common after the diagnosis treatment
starts<00:03:01.610> with<00:03:01.790> non<00:03:02.060> medication<00:03:02.720> options<00:03:03.170> such

starts with non medication options such

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.490 
starts with non medication options such
as<00:03:03.500> a<00:03:03.980> greeted<00:03:04.459> exercise<00:03:05.030> program<00:03:05.660> the

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:06.500 
as a greeted exercise program the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.140 
as a greeted exercise program the
muscles<00:03:06.890> in<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.069> legs<00:03:07.370> are<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:07.790> ones<00:03:08.000> that

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
muscles in the legs are the ones that

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.059 
muscles in the legs are the ones that
push<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.720> blood<00:03:08.930> back<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.560> heart

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
push the blood back to the heart

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.699 
push the blood back to the heart
so<00:03:10.609> getting<00:03:10.880> stronger<00:03:11.420> legs<00:03:11.720> is<00:03:11.989> an<00:03:12.170> important

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
so getting stronger legs is an important

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.039 
so getting stronger legs is an important
first<00:03:12.950> step<00:03:13.130> mr.<00:03:13.700> Rosener<00:03:13.910> like<00:03:14.299> many<00:03:14.720> others

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049 
first step mr. Rosener like many others

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:16.809 
first step mr. Rosener like many others
with<00:03:15.260> his<00:03:15.380> condition<00:03:15.920> quickly<00:03:16.190> become<00:03:16.609> very

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
with his condition quickly become very

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.250 
with his condition quickly become very
deconditioned<00:03:17.569> because<00:03:17.720> they<00:03:17.810> can't<00:03:18.049> stand

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:18.260 
deconditioned because they can't stand

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.860 
deconditioned because they can't stand
to<00:03:18.560> stand<00:03:18.829> i<00:03:19.220> can't<00:03:19.670> walk<00:03:19.880> they<00:03:20.150> can't<00:03:20.420> they

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
to stand i can't walk they can't they

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:22.240 
to stand i can't walk they can't they
can't<00:03:21.139> get<00:03:21.290> around<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.769> do<00:03:21.889> their<00:03:22.069> daily

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
can't get around and do their daily

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.190 
can't get around and do their daily
activities<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.090> he<00:03:23.209> is<00:03:23.329> a<00:03:23.359> full-time

activities and he is a full-time
stay-at-home<00:03:24.769> dad<00:03:25.400> so<00:03:26.120> this<00:03:26.389> is<00:03:26.599> extremely

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:27.139 
stay-at-home dad so this is extremely

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:29.140 
stay-at-home dad so this is extremely

necessarily curable we certainly can
manage<00:04:30.920> them<00:04:31.070> and<00:04:31.250> my<00:04:31.340> goal<00:04:31.610> for<00:04:31.940> patients<00:04:32.420> is

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
manage them and my goal for patients is

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.350 
manage them and my goal for patients is
to<00:04:32.780> get<00:04:32.960> them<00:04:33.140> to<00:04:33.170> at<00:04:33.380> least<00:04:33.590> 50%<00:04:34.040> of<00:04:34.640> their

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
to get them to at least 50% of their

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.200 
to get them to at least 50% of their
previous<00:04:35.780> level<00:04:35.990> of<00:04:36.230> function<00:04:36.680> and<00:04:37.210> very

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
previous level of function and very

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.000 
previous level of function and very
often<00:04:38.420> they<00:04:38.720> do<00:04:38.780> much<00:04:39.080> better<00:04:39.380> than<00:04:39.470> that<00:04:39.770> but

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
often they do much better than that but

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.500 
often they do much better than that but
it's<00:04:40.130> important<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.640> set<00:04:40.940> reasonable

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
it's important to set reasonable

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:44.050 
it's important to set reasonable
expectations<00:04:42.170> of<00:04:42.830> outcomes<00:04:43.280> so<00:04:43.550> once<00:04:43.880> we've

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:44.060 
expectations of outcomes so once we've

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.180 
expectations of outcomes so once we've
done<00:04:44.090> that<00:04:44.330> you<00:04:44.780> can<00:04:44.990> be<00:04:45.170> very<00:04:45.350> successful<00:04:45.680> at
