mission and deployment Emperor's Wales

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.840 
mission and deployment Emperor's Wales
where<00:01:31.119> you<00:01:31.270> have<00:01:31.420> a<00:01:31.450> single<00:01:32.100> objective<00:01:33.100> in

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
where you have a single objective in

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.090 
where you have a single objective in
your<00:01:34.000> deployment<00:01:34.479> zone<00:01:34.630> were<00:01:34.810> three<00:01:35.350> victory

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
your deployment zone were three victory

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.090 
your deployment zone were three victory
points<00:01:36.539> so<00:01:37.539> on<00:01:37.690> top<00:01:37.899> of<00:01:37.960> the<00:01:38.380> other<00:01:38.619> three

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
points so on top of the other three

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.980 
points so on top of the other three
secondary<00:01:39.819> objectives<00:01:40.420> I<00:01:40.600> guess<00:01:40.750> you<00:01:40.869> can

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
secondary objectives I guess you can

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.690 
secondary objectives I guess you can
have<00:01:41.080> a<00:01:41.140> total<00:01:41.470> of<00:01:41.590> six<00:01:41.950> points<00:01:42.659> this<00:01:43.659> match<00:01:44.700> he

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
have a total of six points this match he

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.910 
have a total of six points this match he
places<00:01:45.970> his<00:01:46.360> objective<00:01:47.200> behind<00:01:47.380> that

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
places his objective behind that

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.550 
places his objective behind that
building<00:01:48.729> that<00:01:48.970> he's<00:01:49.299> deploying<00:01:49.929> into<00:01:50.350> right

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
building that he's deploying into right

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.370 
building that he's deploying into right
now<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.880> you<00:01:51.970> can't<00:01:52.209> really<00:01:52.330> see<00:01:52.569> kind<00:01:53.259> of<00:01:53.289> a

venerable<00:03:14.290> venerable<00:03:15.290> dreadnought<00:03:15.439> and<00:03:16.220> then

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
venerable venerable dreadnought and then

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.920 
venerable venerable dreadnought and then
I<00:03:16.730> place<00:03:17.030> my<00:03:17.329> land<00:03:17.989> raider<00:03:18.260> and<00:03:19.930> pretty

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
I place my land raider and pretty

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.259 
I place my land raider and pretty
straightforward<00:03:21.620> nothing<00:03:21.980> really<00:03:22.280> to<00:03:22.819> fancy

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
straightforward nothing really to fancy

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.839 
straightforward nothing really to fancy
about<00:03:23.480> it<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:25.220> is<00:03:25.370> going<00:03:25.489> to<00:03:25.579> give<00:03:25.700> us<00:03:25.730> a

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
about it this is going to give us a

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.399 
about it this is going to give us a
bird's-eye<00:03:26.390> view<00:03:26.810> of<00:03:26.989> the<00:03:27.500> battlefield<00:03:27.970> there

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
bird's-eye view of the battlefield there

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.520 
bird's-eye view of the battlefield there
so<00:03:30.409> my<00:03:30.799> victory<00:03:31.310> point<00:03:31.579> is<00:03:31.760> that<00:03:32.530> objective

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
so my victory point is that objective

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.629 
so my victory point is that objective
point<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:33.829> guess<00:03:33.889> is<00:03:34.159> right<00:03:34.310> next<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.519> my

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
point I guess is right next to my

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:38.199 
point I guess is right next to my
venerable<00:03:34.909> dread<00:03:35.420> we<00:03:36.379> are<00:03:36.530> using<00:03:36.769> Porter's<00:03:37.400> so

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
venerable dread we are using Porter's so

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.099 
venerable dread we are using Porter's so
they're<00:03:38.329> nice<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:38.690> shiny<00:03:39.849> uh-huh<00:03:40.849> and<00:03:41.269> so<00:03:42.019> you

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:42.109 
they're nice and shiny uh-huh and so you

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:45.000 
they're nice and shiny uh-huh and so you
can<00:03:42.319> see<00:03:42.500> his<00:03:42.680> army<00:03:43.040> like<00:03:43.609> he<00:03:43.819> said<00:03:44.090> his

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
can see his army like he said his

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:51.640 
can see his army like he said his
reserves<00:03:46.010> are<00:03:46.340> the<00:03:48.760> sniper<00:03:49.760> guys<00:03:50.319> death<00:03:51.319> marks

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
reserves are the sniper guys death marks

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.250 
reserves are the sniper guys death marks
that's<00:03:51.920> right<00:03:52.329> so<00:03:53.329> there<00:03:53.599> you<00:03:53.629> go<00:03:53.780> there's<00:03:54.049> an

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
that's right so there you go there's an

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:55.869 
that's right so there you go there's an
overview<00:03:54.709> of<00:03:54.799> the<00:03:54.920> board<00:03:55.220> and<00:03:55.430> we're<00:03:55.790> gonna

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:55.879 
overview of the board and we're gonna

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:57.910 
overview of the board and we're gonna
attempt<00:03:56.269> to<00:03:56.420> steal<00:03:56.569> the<00:03:56.750> initiative<00:03:57.139> he<00:03:57.739> does

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
attempt to steal the initiative he does

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.140 
attempt to steal the initiative he does
get<00:03:58.040> first<00:03:58.310> turn<00:03:58.519> but<00:03:58.549> let's<00:03:58.849> see<00:03:58.970> if<00:03:59.000> I<00:03:59.120> can

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
get first turn but let's see if I can

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.360 
get first turn but let's see if I can
steal<00:03:59.540> it<00:03:59.659> and<00:04:00.620> I<00:04:01.430> get<00:04:01.609> a<00:04:02.170> nothing<00:04:03.170> one<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:04.160> the

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
steal it and I get a nothing one so the

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.550 
steal it and I get a nothing one so the
orange<00:04:04.910> dice<00:04:05.180> are<00:04:05.480> a<00:04:05.540> little<00:04:05.870> bit<00:04:06.199> harder<00:04:06.530> to

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
orange dice are a little bit harder to

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.589 
orange dice are a little bit harder to
see<00:04:06.889> it<00:04:07.370> is<00:04:07.519> knife<00:04:07.760> fighting<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:08.150> first<00:04:08.389> turn

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
see it is knife fighting the first turn

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.839 
see it is knife fighting the first turn
and<00:04:08.959> we<00:04:09.440> do<00:04:09.590> we<00:04:09.859> have<00:04:10.010> been<00:04:10.160> using<00:04:10.340> them<00:04:10.519> for<00:04:10.579> a

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
and we do we have been using them for a

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.059 
and we do we have been using them for a
little<00:04:11.000> while<00:04:11.239> where<00:04:11.959> we<00:04:12.079> use<00:04:12.440> them<00:04:12.650> this<00:04:12.799> game

00:04:13.059 --> 00:04:13.069 
little while where we use them this game

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.060 
little while where we use them this game
for<00:04:13.370> some<00:04:13.639> time<00:04:14.109> so<00:04:15.109> he's<00:04:15.230> revealing<00:04:15.650> that

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
for some time so he's revealing that

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.120 
for some time so he's revealing that
it's<00:04:16.459> a<00:04:16.549> 3<00:04:17.120> which<00:04:17.510> i<00:04:17.659> believe<00:04:17.720> is

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
it's a 3 which i believe is

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:26.240 
it's a 3 which i believe is
the<00:04:20.130> night<00:04:20.480> no<00:04:22.760> you<00:04:23.760> can<00:04:23.910> shoot<00:04:24.270> at<00:04:25.170> flyers<00:04:25.800> I
