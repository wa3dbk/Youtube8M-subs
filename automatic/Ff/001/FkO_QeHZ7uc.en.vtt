going<00:06:00.100> to<00:06:00.310> have<00:06:00.490> a<00:06:00.520> little<00:06:01.060> bit<00:06:01.270> more<00:06:01.890> so<00:06:02.890> try<00:06:03.700> a

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
going to have a little bit more so try a

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:07.430 
going to have a little bit more so try a
little<00:06:04.900> bit<00:06:05.290> more

I'm going to slow down a little bit and

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:11.679 
I'm going to slow down a little bit and
get<00:06:10.170> in<00:06:10.380> second

00:06:11.679 --> 00:06:11.689 
get in second

00:06:11.689 --> 00:06:15.909 
get in second
then<00:06:12.289> I<00:06:12.499> can<00:06:12.860> accelerate

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:15.919

than<00:06:16.249> sound<00:06:17.409> and<00:06:18.409> then<00:06:18.680> far<00:06:20.530> so<00:06:21.530> it<00:06:21.860> gives<00:06:22.219> you

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
than sound and then far so it gives you

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:25.989 
than sound and then far so it gives you
the<00:06:22.729> speed<00:06:23.539> the<00:06:24.139> gear<00:06:24.379> number<00:06:24.919> in<00:06:25.400> which<00:06:25.669> you

00:06:25.989 --> 00:06:25.999 
the speed the gear number in which you
