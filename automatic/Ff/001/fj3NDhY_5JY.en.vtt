 My father said that he was here in the 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:17.220
 I found the deposit 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.669
 This camera is not mine. It's old. 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.720

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:23.720
 Still works 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.710
 that's how I ended up here 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:36.050
 Where is this place approved by 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.750
 unanimously the proposal of the President 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.980
 juscelino kubischek that changes the capital 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:45.559
 federal to Brasilia but this happened 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.230
 in 1956 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.460
 damn all the rio de janeiro the old 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.670
 brazil capital 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:57.170
 I need to get out of here, I think I know 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:59.090
 That boy is my grandfather. 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:03.079
 in the photos from home 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.710
 You gotta ask for his help, and that's you. 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:11.180
 that this boy I do not have a grandchild anymore 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.160
 will have and am I am z plenarinho wu is 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.770
 I found your camcorder there in the 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.350
 my house and when I pressed the vim button 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.500
 stop here 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.830
 I can not believe what I see the self. 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.170
 but that is not right it is not right 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.950
 It's not right, we have to give it back to you. 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.950
 for the future 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:40.130
 Hey, fellow palace, my friend, 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:42.020
 young what is palace tiradentes 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.259
 I'm paying attention here in a session 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:48.770
 the senate because it's a session that I want 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.080
 I just heard you talking here in the camera. 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.619
 that will transfer the capital of Brazil 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:58.549
 for such a brazilian 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:02.689
 it is but if the capital goes we the power 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.759
 legislative or they'll also 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.670
 launched a competition to plan the 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:11.450
 new city and it seems that everything there is going to be 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.560
 brand new and the President has jk 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.860
 hurry 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:20.840
 the city should be ready on the 21st of 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.010
 April 1960 tiradentes and it will not 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.840
 succeed 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.560
 imagine a city being built in 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.290
 four years is impossible I think the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:33.069
 business is serious you better stay 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.319
 but what the senators say there 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.300
 Leave me with it but I doubt they will. 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:44.120
 build buildings more beautiful than 

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:49.000
 people let me see you said that 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.000
 pressed this button to kitty 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:54.349
 we are here with Lucio Costa who was 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.349
 who made the urban plan of brasília 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:00.440
 and with oscar niemeyer architect who 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:03.409
 designed the main buildings of the city 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.060
 the brasilian buildings prefer congress 

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:08.030
 it is perfect with an architecture in the 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:11.030
 my point of view it is simple despite 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:13.760
 to be complex and introduced him that 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.860
 Horizontal plate is on a good level of the 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.650
 avenues is not an idea is that the person 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.390
 approaching the building said beyond 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.540
 building between cultures 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.430
 the square of the sector from which it forms part 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.650
 it is obvious that this explains why that 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:31.790
 low roof level of miners 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:34.660
 he had the sensitivity of ensuring his 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:38.530
 perspective that the project can not be 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.390
 offering I like 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.470
 This is so fantastic. 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.069
 simple is not 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:47.510
 and who it is monumental that keeps our 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:50.060
 cool 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.690
 I've studied so much now that I can see 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:56.030
 alive and color how it all happened 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.010
 joe it just never sure does not work 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:00.280
 It's not right to be traveling like this. 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.280
 time 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.129
 monkeys bite me 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.879
 now the senate and the chamber are side by side. 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:15.920
 side 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:18.139
 if I were a journalist of the present 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:20.329
 I was not going to have to keep driving 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:24.500
 to go from house to house that idea 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:26.720
 wonderful because it 's Grandma and beyond 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.610
 The beauty of Brasilia was many 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.789
 achievements of the Brazilian citizen since 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:34.520
 Everything has changed here but it is not 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:36.949
 It's not right, I can not be right. 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.539
 here my grandson is necessary to find a way to 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:43.490
 back to 1956 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.289
 I think if you put the movie of 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:47.780
 voting time and tighten that 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:51.050
 machine button will work but 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.740
 I need to do it alone and I can not 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.330
 take you with me again I do not 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.240
 I wanted you to come back 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.240
 I'm going to miss you, please me too. 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:12.160
 Sat 

00:05:09.699 --> 00:05:14.440
 I had to think and if all this 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.629
 history of such brasília works out 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.830
 Will not we have more 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:21.370
 importance 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:24.159
 die, I thought a lot and I realized 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:27.039
 which is not the place that matters but yes 

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:31.300
 what happens inside him and us 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:33.699
 we are the legislative power is right on the river 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:35.560
 January or in Brazil, what matters 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:39.539
 is to guarantee a space where people have the 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.539
 voice and can fight for your rights 

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:53.139
 It's worked out well and the palace of the 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:53.139
 National congress was fantastic.
