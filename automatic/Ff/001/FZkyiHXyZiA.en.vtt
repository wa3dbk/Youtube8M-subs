where I got these equal tools brushes

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.140 
where I got these equal tools brushes
and<00:03:38.810> I'm<00:03:39.019> gonna<00:03:39.200> get<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.560> couple<00:03:39.919> more<00:03:40.280> simply

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
and I'm gonna get a couple more simply

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:42.670 
and I'm gonna get a couple more simply
because<00:03:41.510> I<00:03:41.780> don't<00:03:41.959> know<00:03:42.079> about<00:03:42.260> you<00:03:42.440> guys<00:03:42.620> but

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680 
because I don't know about you guys but

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.860 
because I don't know about you guys but
when<00:03:42.949> I<00:03:43.099> tend<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.519> find<00:03:43.730> something<00:03:44.239> that<00:03:44.840> I

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
when I tend to find something that I

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.699 
when I tend to find something that I
like<00:03:45.230> if<00:03:45.620> I<00:03:46.310> sit<00:03:46.549> on<00:03:46.730> it<00:03:46.849> for<00:03:47.000> too<00:03:47.209> long<00:03:47.530> I'll<00:03:48.530> go

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
like if I sit on it for too long I'll go

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:52.420 
like if I sit on it for too long I'll go
back<00:03:49.180> it's<00:03:50.180> never<00:03:50.449> there<00:03:50.709> so<00:03:51.709> that's<00:03:52.129> what<00:03:52.340> I'm

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430 
back it's never there so that's what I'm

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.210 
back it's never there so that's what I'm
going<00:03:52.609> out<00:03:52.819> to<00:03:52.970> do<00:03:53.150> it's<00:03:53.780> a<00:03:53.959> fraction<00:03:54.889> of<00:03:55.069> the

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
going out to do it's a fraction of the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:59.319 
going out to do it's a fraction of the
price<00:03:55.430> of<00:03:57.190> Mac<00:03:58.190> and<00:03:58.549> all<00:03:58.669> these<00:03:58.910> really

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
price of Mac and all these really

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:05.160 
price of Mac and all these really
expensive<00:03:59.810> brushes

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:05.170 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:08.430 

and<00:04:05.860> that's<00:04:06.100> it<00:04:06.610> it's<00:04:06.940> I<00:04:07.330> think<00:04:07.720> it's<00:04:08.290> quite

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
and that's it it's I think it's quite

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.830 
and that's it it's I think it's quite
quick<00:04:08.770> I<00:04:09.069> think<00:04:09.670> it's<00:04:09.819> quite<00:04:09.970> simple<00:04:12.600> and<00:04:13.600> what

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:13.840 
quick I think it's quite simple and what

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:15.600 
quick I think it's quite simple and what
I<00:04:13.870> would<00:04:14.080> tend<00:04:14.290> to<00:04:14.380> do<00:04:14.560> now<00:04:14.770> is<00:04:15.040> just<00:04:15.400> use<00:04:15.580> a

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
I would tend to do now is just use a

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:24.409 
I would tend to do now is just use a
little<00:04:15.790> bit<00:04:15.970> of<00:04:16.540> my<00:04:17.230> black<00:04:17.440> powder<00:04:18.390> in<00:04:19.390> dark

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.710 

and<00:04:25.419> you<00:04:26.410> want<00:04:26.650> to<00:04:26.800> pack<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.370> powder<00:04:27.550> in<00:04:28.000> not

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 
and you want to pack the powder in not

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.340 
and you want to pack the powder in not
buff<00:04:29.020> it<00:04:29.260> and<00:04:29.440> move<00:04:29.650> it<00:04:29.800> around<00:04:30.090> because<00:04:31.350> you

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
buff it and move it around because you

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.920 
buff it and move it around because you
want<00:04:32.560> to<00:04:32.680> keep<00:04:33.100> your<00:04:33.400> product<00:04:33.990> fixed<00:04:34.990> and<00:04:36.930> it

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
want to keep your product fixed and it

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.740 
want to keep your product fixed and it
may<00:04:38.260> look<00:04:38.470> dry<00:04:38.790> but<00:04:39.790> nine<00:04:40.000> times<00:04:40.270> out<00:04:40.419> of<00:04:40.450> ten

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
may look dry but nine times out of ten

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.750 
may look dry but nine times out of ten
most<00:04:41.140> foundations<00:04:41.860> take<00:04:42.100> quite<00:04:42.280> a<00:04:42.340> while<00:04:42.400> to

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
most foundations take quite a while to

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:45.930 
most foundations take quite a while to
dry<00:04:42.850> and<00:04:43.210> if<00:04:43.570> you<00:04:43.810> start<00:04:44.200> rubbing<00:04:44.830> in<00:04:45.190> stuff<00:04:45.550> I

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
dry and if you start rubbing in stuff I

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.390 
dry and if you start rubbing in stuff I
mean<00:04:46.600> this<00:04:46.720> is<00:04:46.870> all<00:04:46.990> in<00:04:47.110> my<00:04:47.230> way<00:04:47.500> but<00:04:48.160> if<00:04:48.280> you

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
mean this is all in my way but if you

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.380 
mean this is all in my way but if you
start<00:04:48.700> rubbing<00:04:49.030> it<00:04:49.270> and<00:04:49.390> rubbing<00:04:49.720> in<00:04:49.840> powder

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:51.390 
start rubbing it and rubbing in powder

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.500 
start rubbing it and rubbing in powder
it<00:04:52.390> displaces<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:53.080> lot<00:04:53.260> of<00:04:53.380> your<00:04:53.530> product

the direction that your hair sits

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.150 
the direction that your hair sits
because<00:05:10.210> if<00:05:10.360> you<00:05:10.479> do<00:05:10.660> it<00:05:10.810> up<00:05:11.020> and<00:05:11.470> round<00:05:11.770> and

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160

swirl it around

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.240 
swirl it around
it<00:05:13.180> only<00:05:13.419> disturbs<00:05:13.900> the<00:05:14.140> hair<00:05:14.410> and<00:05:14.800> then<00:05:15.220> you

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
it only disturbs the hair and then you

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.909 
it only disturbs the hair and then you
don't<00:05:15.550> get<00:05:15.700> a<00:05:15.760> smooth<00:05:16.240> looking<00:05:16.690> canvas<00:05:17.229> that's
