00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
would just lay flat but I do want to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.279 
would just lay flat but I do want to
explain<00:00:56.640> why<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.000> had<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.390> use<00:00:57.600> tips<00:00:57.899> for<00:00:58.140> this

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:01.040 
explain why I had to use tips for this
one<00:00:58.530> it<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.890> because<00:00:59.340> I'm<00:00:59.910> going<00:01:00.359> to<00:01:00.449> be<00:01:00.539> using

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
one it is because I'm going to be using

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.770 
one it is because I'm going to be using
a<00:01:01.559> cover<00:01:02.100> pink<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.149> can<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.480> have

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
a cover pink and as you can see I have

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.460 
a cover pink and as you can see I have
dark<00:01:04.140> nail<00:01:04.439> beds<00:01:04.739> so<00:01:05.780> you<00:01:06.780> could<00:01:06.930> kind<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.200> see

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
dark nail beds so you could kind of see

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.859 
dark nail beds so you could kind of see
the<00:01:07.890> demarcation<00:01:08.610> if<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.360> just<00:01:09.570> do<00:01:09.720> my

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
the demarcation if I just do my

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.859 
the demarcation if I just do my
sculpture<00:01:10.409> nails<00:01:10.650> so<00:01:10.979> that's<00:01:11.729> why<00:01:11.909> I<00:01:11.970> did<00:01:12.479> tips

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
sculpture nails so that's why I did tips

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.240 
sculpture nails so that's why I did tips
for<00:01:13.110> this<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.680> it<00:01:13.860> could<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.010> be

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
for this one so it could just be

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.880 
for this one so it could just be
seamless<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.210> really<00:01:15.450> can't<00:01:15.659> tell<00:01:15.890> where

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
seamless and you really can't tell where

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.080 
seamless and you really can't tell where
my<00:01:17.310> nail<00:01:18.030> stops<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.750> the<00:01:19.200> tip<00:01:19.439> starts<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.670> I<00:01:20.700> go

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
my nail stops and the tip starts so I go

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.850

cutting them these nails are so long I'm
having<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> hard<00:01:26.310> time<00:01:26.400> even<00:01:26.909> holding<00:01:27.450> the<00:01:28.350> nail

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590

clipper

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.859 
clipper
but<00:01:29.460> yeah<00:01:29.579> I<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:30.000> clip<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.630> both<00:01:30.810> sides

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
but yeah I just clip it on both sides

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.380 
but yeah I just clip it on both sides
and<00:01:31.530> then<00:01:31.710> twist<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.100> off<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.490> try<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:33.060> it<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
and then twist it off I try to do it a

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.660 
and then twist it off I try to do it a
little<00:01:33.810> longer<00:01:34.140> than<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:34.590> I<00:01:34.650> want<00:01:35.009> because

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
of course after you shape it it's going

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.020 
of course after you shape it it's going
to<00:01:37.740> get<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.920> lot<00:01:38.189> shorter

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030

nails<00:02:40.850> off<00:02:41.150> of<00:02:41.360> Instagram<00:02:41.630> and<00:02:42.140> it's<00:02:42.500> that

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:56.000 

I<00:02:52.549> must<00:02:53.549> say<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:54.209> tips<00:02:54.540> were<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.079> lot<00:02:55.349> faster

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
I must say the tips were a lot faster

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:59.629 
I must say the tips were a lot faster
and<00:02:56.280> since<00:02:57.120> I<00:02:57.269> learned<00:02:58.019> how<00:02:58.349> to<00:02:58.379> shape<00:02:58.920> my

00:02:59.629 --> 00:02:59.639 
and since I learned how to shape my

00:02:59.639 --> 00:03:02.030 
and since I learned how to shape my
nails<00:02:59.969> slimmer<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.170> to<00:03:01.499> make<00:03:01.680> them<00:03:01.829> look<00:03:01.980> a

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
nails slimmer and to make them look a

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.000 
nails slimmer and to make them look a
little<00:03:02.189> more<00:03:02.370> natural<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:04.019> me<00:03:04.230> I<00:03:04.469> can't<00:03:04.859> even

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
little more natural to me I can't even

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.479 
little more natural to me I can't even
tell<00:03:05.370> that<00:03:05.730> I<00:03:05.790> have<00:03:06.599> tips<00:03:06.930> on<00:03:07.139> so<00:03:07.680> I<00:03:07.709> think<00:03:07.889> I

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
tell that I have tips on so I think I

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.319 
tell that I have tips on so I think I
may<00:03:08.939> start<00:03:09.359> using<00:03:10.019> tips<00:03:10.590> because<00:03:11.099> the<00:03:11.819> process

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
may start using tips because the process

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:15.800 
may start using tips because the process
went<00:03:12.599> a<00:03:12.719> lot<00:03:12.959> faster<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:13.980> I<00:03:14.340> use<00:03:14.939> way<00:03:15.419> less

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
went a lot faster and I use way less

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:28.459 
went a lot faster and I use way less
powder<00:03:26.090> so<00:03:27.090> yeah<00:03:27.299> I<00:03:27.540> just<00:03:27.599> go<00:03:28.019> ahead<00:03:28.139> and<00:03:28.379> take

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:28.469 
powder so yeah I just go ahead and take

00:03:28.469 --> 00:03:30.830 
powder so yeah I just go ahead and take
my<00:03:28.530> time<00:03:28.919> placing<00:03:29.579> my<00:03:29.909> acrylic<00:03:30.599> very

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840
