00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.839 
let's send some other design
to<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.829> stick<00:02:14.930> select<00:02:15.930> file<00:02:16.349> open<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.040> next

to the stick select file open and next

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.179 
to the stick select file open and next
we're<00:02:18.030> going<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.329> select<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.930> paintwork<00:02:19.469> design

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:20.189 
we're going to select a paintwork design

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.000 
we're going to select a paintwork design
I'll<00:02:20.549> navigate<00:02:21.150> up<00:02:21.689> one<00:02:21.959> level<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.890> the

I'll navigate up one level to the

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.630 
I'll navigate up one level to the
paintwork<00:02:23.489> file<00:02:24.120> folder<00:02:24.569> and<00:02:24.859> let's<00:02:25.859> select<00:02:26.280> a

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
paintwork file folder and let's select a

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.380 
paintwork file folder and let's select a
design<00:02:27.060> and<00:02:27.390> click<00:02:27.900> on<00:02:28.140> open

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
design and click on open

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.929 
design and click on open
when<00:02:30.390> this<00:02:30.599> design<00:02:31.049> opens<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.220> can<00:02:32.459> again

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:32.939 
when this design opens I can again

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.210 
when this design opens I can again
select<00:02:33.359> on<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:33.900> individual<00:02:34.500> components<00:02:35.099> of

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
select on the individual components of

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.670 
select on the individual components of
the<00:02:35.370> design<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.090> see<00:02:36.450> in<00:02:36.720> object<00:02:37.200> properties

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
the design and see in object properties

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.729 
the design and see in object properties
that<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.099> is<00:02:38.280> a<00:02:38.310> painted<00:02:38.879> design<00:02:39.439> also<00:02:40.439> if<00:02:40.620> you

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
that it is a painted design also if you

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.009 
that it is a painted design also if you
look<00:02:40.950> at<00:02:41.099> the<00:02:41.220> brushes<00:02:41.700> palette<00:02:42.000> you<00:02:42.659> can<00:02:42.689> see

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
look at the brushes palette you can see

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.349 
look at the brushes palette you can see
all<00:02:43.200> the<00:02:43.319> colors<00:02:43.500> are<00:02:43.889> listed<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.489> brushes<00:02:45.090> and

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
all the colors are listed in brushes and

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.199 
all the colors are listed in brushes and
none<00:02:45.720> in<00:02:45.930> threads<00:02:46.379> so<00:02:46.769> I<00:02:46.950> know<00:02:47.040> that<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.700> is<00:02:48.000> a

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
none in threads so I know that this is a

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:51.979 
none in threads so I know that this is a
paintwork<00:02:48.720> design<00:02:49.400> to<00:02:50.400> export<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:51.389> file<00:02:51.689> I

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
paintwork design to export this file I

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.309 
paintwork design to export this file I
simply<00:02:52.560> click<00:02:52.829> on<00:02:52.980> export<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:54.359> same<00:02:54.659> process

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
simply click on export the same process

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.520 
simply click on export the same process
but<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.859> time<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.459> only<00:02:56.519> have<00:02:57.239> a<00:02:57.450> USB<00:02:57.900> stick

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
but this time I only have a USB stick

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.819 
but this time I only have a USB stick
and<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:59.370> is<00:02:59.669> because<00:03:00.120> all<00:03:00.620> paint<00:03:01.620> work

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
and that is because all paint work

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.059 
and that is because all paint work
compatible<00:03:02.489> machines<00:03:02.909> will<00:03:03.569> work<00:03:03.900> with<00:03:04.349> a<00:03:04.530> USB

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
compatible machines will work with a USB

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.080 
compatible machines will work with a USB
stick<00:03:05.639> I<00:03:05.909> simply<00:03:06.629> click<00:03:06.870> on<00:03:07.019> the<00:03:07.169> USB<00:03:07.470> and

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.509 
stick I simply click on the USB and
again<00:03:09.090> I<00:03:09.329> receive<00:03:09.840> a<00:03:10.049> dialog<00:03:10.620> box<00:03:10.859> that<00:03:11.099> says

again I receive a dialog box that says

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.569 
again I receive a dialog box that says

the file in the design work screen when
I<00:03:40.769> select<00:03:41.370> this<00:03:41.609> design<00:03:42.540> you<00:03:43.379> can<00:03:43.590> see<00:03:43.859> that<00:03:44.190> I

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
I select this design you can see that I

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.520 
I select this design you can see that I
can<00:03:44.669> see<00:03:44.970> that<00:03:45.120> it's<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.389> crystal<00:03:45.810> design<00:03:46.229> I

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
can see that it's a crystal design I

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.759 
can see that it's a crystal design I
also<00:03:46.919> see<00:03:47.459> that<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.940> uses<00:03:48.209> size<00:03:48.629> 6<00:03:49.109> crystals

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
also see that it uses size 6 crystals

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:53.839 
also see that it uses size 6 crystals
when<00:03:50.609> I<00:03:50.639> look<00:03:51.299> at<00:03:51.479> my<00:03:51.599> export<00:03:52.260> icon<00:03:52.500> however<00:03:53.400> it

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
when I look at my export icon however it

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:56.869 
when I look at my export icon however it
is<00:03:54.180> grayed<00:03:54.569> out<00:03:54.599> and<00:03:55.319> this<00:03:55.829> is<00:03:56.069> because<00:03:56.519> with

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
is grayed out and this is because with

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:59.599 
is grayed out and this is because with
crystal<00:03:57.479> designs<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:58.560> have<00:03:58.590> to<00:03:59.099> send<00:03:59.430> the
