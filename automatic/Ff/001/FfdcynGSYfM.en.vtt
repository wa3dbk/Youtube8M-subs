power drive trolling motors got foot

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:15.230 
power drive trolling motors got foot
control<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:13.099> found<00:00:14.099> this<00:00:14.309> online<00:00:14.549> this<00:00:15.000> is<00:00:15.059> an

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
control and found this online this is an

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.019 
control and found this online this is an
addition<00:00:15.750> they<00:00:15.900> make<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.070> go<00:00:17.250> cordless<00:00:17.789> so

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
addition they make the go cordless so

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.150 
addition they make the go cordless so
just<00:00:18.810> received<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.289> in<00:00:19.470> the<00:00:19.500> mail<00:00:19.590> gonna<00:00:20.070> go

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
just received this in the mail gonna go

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.640 
just received this in the mail gonna go
ahead<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.400> install<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:21.900> motor<00:00:22.230> and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
ahead and install this on this motor and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.609 
ahead and install this on this motor and
see<00:00:23.130> if<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.310> makes<00:00:23.430> it<00:00:23.580> easier<00:00:23.939> to<00:00:23.970> control

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
see if it makes it easier to control

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.679 
see if it makes it easier to control
actually<00:00:25.619> believe<00:00:26.160> this<00:00:26.460> is<00:00:26.699> a<00:00:26.730> second<00:00:27.449> one<00:00:27.570> of

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
actually believe this is a second one of

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.179 
actually believe this is a second one of
these<00:00:27.779> motors<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.320> had<00:00:28.500> I<00:00:28.529> had<00:00:28.830> one<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.099> that

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
these motors I had I had one on that

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.759 
these motors I had I had one on that
small<00:00:29.519> fishing<00:00:29.970> boat<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.449> I<00:00:30.929> built<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.560> deck

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
small fishing boat that I built a deck

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.220 
small fishing boat that I built a deck
in<00:00:32.070> but<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.910> was<00:00:33.000> an<00:00:33.090> earlier<00:00:33.390> version<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:34.140> the

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
in but it was an earlier version but the

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.139 
in but it was an earlier version but the
foot<00:00:34.410> controls<00:00:34.860> on<00:00:35.280> these<00:00:35.460> neither<00:00:35.880> one<00:00:36.120> of

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
foot controls on these neither one of

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.180 
foot controls on these neither one of
them<00:00:36.329> worked<00:00:36.540> good<00:00:36.780> so<00:00:37.559> I<00:00:37.590> hope<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:38.010> is<00:00:38.160> a

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
them worked good so I hope this is a

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.400 
them worked good so I hope this is a
solution<00:00:38.730> because<00:00:39.329> those<00:00:39.570> foot<00:00:39.809> pedals<00:00:40.170> are

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
solution because those foot pedals are

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.250 
solution because those foot pedals are
very<00:00:41.100> hard<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.520> operate<00:00:41.790> and<00:00:42.180> this<00:00:42.989> is

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
very hard to operate and this is

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.799 
very hard to operate and this is
supposed<00:00:43.800> to<00:00:43.829> make<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.010> difference<00:00:44.399> so<00:00:44.460> for<00:00:45.239> say

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
supposed to make a difference so for say

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.150 
supposed to make a difference so for say
around<00:00:46.110> $150<00:00:46.980> we're<00:00:47.100> going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.280> find<00:00:47.460> out<00:00:49.160> okay

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
around $150 we're going to find out okay

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.560 
around $150 we're going to find out okay
then<00:00:50.370> here's<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.670> rear<00:00:50.969> view<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.300> this

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
then here's a rear view of this

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.479 
then here's a rear view of this
evidently<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.320> this<00:00:52.500> piece<00:00:52.739> or<00:00:53.010> some<00:00:53.280> kind<00:00:53.460> of

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
evidently in this piece or some kind of

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.490 
evidently in this piece or some kind of
brains<00:00:53.789> it's<00:00:54.090> going<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.360> tell<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.809> cordless

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
brains it's going to tell that cordless

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.830 
brains it's going to tell that cordless
receiver<00:00:55.920> how<00:00:56.160> to<00:00:56.219> work<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.760> these<00:00:57.570> two

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
receiver how to work and these two

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.020 
receiver how to work and these two
connections<00:00:58.320> here<00:00:58.530> one<00:00:58.770> plugs<00:00:59.100> into<00:00:59.489> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
connections here one plugs into the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.939 
connections here one plugs into the
control<00:01:00.480> on<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> boat<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.320> other<00:01:01.469> one<00:01:01.710> is

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
control on the boat and the other one is

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.799 
control on the boat and the other one is
for<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> foot<00:01:02.699> pedal<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.239> if<00:01:03.329> you<00:01:03.449> want<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.690> run

for the foot pedal so if you want to run

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.730 
for the foot pedal so if you want to run

is pushing these buttons you'll see the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.700 
is pushing these buttons you'll see the
motor<00:01:33.420> turn<00:01:33.720> out<00:01:33.930> there

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
motor turn out there

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.749

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
hopefully this'll fix this

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:40.120 
hopefully this'll fix this
out-of-control<00:01:38.630> situation<00:01:39.200> this<00:01:39.740> motor<00:01:40.009> to

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.130 
out-of-control situation this motor to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.950 
out-of-control situation this motor to
me<00:01:40.399> does<00:01:40.640> not<00:01:40.820> work<00:01:41.060> very<00:01:41.329> well<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:41.630> it<00:01:41.750> seems
