revive<00:00:48.600> easily<00:00:49.170> here's<00:00:49.410> what<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.800> propose

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
revive easily here's what I propose

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.000 
revive easily here's what I propose
the<00:00:51.000> walkway<00:00:51.450> is<00:00:51.480> raised<00:00:51.989> slightly<00:00:52.470> so<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the walkway is raised slightly so that

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.700 
the walkway is raised slightly so that
you<00:00:53.309> can<00:00:53.489> jump<00:00:53.730> down<00:00:54.000> but<00:00:54.600> you<00:00:54.720> can't<00:00:55.050> jump<00:00:55.440> up

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
you can jump down but you can't jump up

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.619 
you can jump down but you can't jump up
this<00:00:56.339> prevents<00:00:56.790> players<00:00:57.000> from<00:00:57.150> click<00:00:57.360> revive

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
this prevents players from click revive

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.689 
this prevents players from click revive
easily<00:00:58.110> making<00:00:58.470> it<00:00:58.589> to<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.890> training<00:00:59.370> area

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
easily making it to the training area

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.160 
easily making it to the training area
and<00:00:59.909> allowing<00:01:00.330> those<00:01:00.480> in<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.720> training<00:01:01.019> area

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and allowing those in the training area

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.259 
and allowing those in the training area
to<00:01:01.379> easily<00:01:01.710> access<00:01:02.010> quick<00:01:02.460> revive<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.970> think

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
to easily access quick revive I think

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:04.700 
to easily access quick revive I think
that<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:03.540> the<00:01:03.629> best<00:01:03.839> solution<00:01:04.019> for<00:01:04.559> all<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
that it's the best solution for all of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:14.490 
that it's the best solution for all of
this<00:01:04.890> nonsense

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.740 

number<00:01:15.500> four<00:01:15.710> and<00:01:15.979> also<00:01:16.400> a<00:01:16.430> very<00:01:16.729> petty<00:01:17.030> idea<00:01:17.570> I

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
number four and also a very petty idea I

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.480 
number four and also a very petty idea I
wish<00:01:18.110> this<00:01:18.350> face<00:01:18.650> was<00:01:18.920> something<00:01:19.250> we<00:01:19.340> could

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
wish this face was something we could

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:21.820 
wish this face was something we could
slide<00:01:19.820> on<00:01:19.880> what<00:01:20.450> it<00:01:20.540> would<00:01:20.659> do<00:01:20.810> is<00:01:21.080> one<00:01:21.350> and<00:01:21.619> an

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
slide on what it would do is one and an

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.310 
slide on what it would do is one and an
element<00:01:22.220> of<00:01:22.369> realism<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:23.270> to<00:01:23.750> make<00:01:24.110> it<00:01:24.229> a

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
element of realism and to make it a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.590 
element of realism and to make it a
little<00:01:24.530> bit<00:01:24.740> more<00:01:24.979> difficult<00:01:25.670> if<00:01:26.150> you're<00:01:26.479> in

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
little bit more difficult if you're in

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.330 
little bit more difficult if you're in
here<00:01:26.780> with<00:01:26.900> a<00:01:26.960> board<00:01:27.380> and<00:01:27.619> you<00:01:27.710> accidentally

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
here with a board and you accidentally

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.800 
here with a board and you accidentally
slip<00:01:28.580> and<00:01:28.759> maybe<00:01:28.909> go<00:01:29.119> past<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.600> little

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
slip and maybe go past a little

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.690 
slip and maybe go past a little
staircase<00:01:30.229> or<00:01:30.619> something<00:01:31.040> lose<00:01:31.220> control<00:01:31.670> of

staircase or something lose control of
your<00:01:31.850> hold<00:01:32.210> will<00:01:32.420> then<00:01:32.570> boom<00:01:32.780> you're<00:01:33.440> dead<00:01:33.680> it

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
your hold will then boom you're dead it

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.749 
your hold will then boom you're dead it
would<00:01:33.979> make<00:01:34.130> things<00:01:34.340> much<00:01:34.490> more<00:01:34.700> difficult

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
would make things much more difficult

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.060 
would make things much more difficult
and<00:01:35.479> we've<00:01:35.690> seen<00:01:35.930> it<00:01:36.050> implemented<00:01:36.470> in<00:01:36.800> Call<00:01:37.040> of

and we've seen it implemented in Call of

and we've seen it implemented in Call of

Duty before in black ops 2 there was ice
that<00:01:39.229> we<00:01:39.350> could<00:01:39.470> slide<00:01:39.710> on<00:01:39.770> and<00:01:40.250> why<00:01:40.790> can't<00:01:41.090> we

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
that we could slide on and why can't we

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.389 
that we could slide on and why can't we
slide<00:01:41.420> on<00:01:41.570> this<00:01:41.690> ice<00:01:41.960> in<00:01:42.320> Call<00:01:42.740> of<00:01:42.770> the<00:01:43.070> Dead<00:01:43.250> it

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.040 
slide on this ice in Call of the Dead it
only<00:01:43.550> makes<00:01:43.850> sense<00:01:44.060> when<00:01:44.330> you're<00:01:44.690> on<00:01:44.869> ice

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050

think<00:03:28.100> Trek<00:03:28.370> needs<00:03:28.640> to<00:03:28.760> give<00:03:28.880> us<00:03:29.000> a<00:03:29.090> way<00:03:29.180> to

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:29.240 
think Trek needs to give us a way to

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:39.600 
think Trek needs to give us a way to
shoot<00:03:29.480> ourselves<00:03:29.630> with<00:03:30.050> the<00:03:30.140> VR<00:03:30.440> 11

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.800 

we've<00:03:40.610> reached<00:03:40.850> the<00:03:40.970> number-one<00:03:41.240> spot<00:03:41.510> and

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810 
we've reached the number-one spot and

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:43.150 
we've reached the number-one spot and
I'm<00:03:41.870> gonna<00:03:42.020> wrap<00:03:42.200> up<00:03:42.380> today's<00:03:42.680> list<00:03:42.980> by

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
I'm gonna wrap up today's list by

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.890 
I'm gonna wrap up today's list by
requesting<00:03:43.640> that<00:03:43.790> the<00:03:43.910> scavenger<00:03:44.450> 1<00:03:44.600> pack<00:03:44.870> a

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
requesting that the scavenger 1 pack a

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.260 
requesting that the scavenger 1 pack a
punched<00:03:45.350> is<00:03:45.560> always<00:03:46.160> a<00:03:46.190> one-shot<00:03:46.790> kill<00:03:46.820> if<00:03:47.180> you

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:47.270 
punched is always a one-shot kill if you

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.150 
punched is always a one-shot kill if you
didn't<00:03:47.510> know<00:03:47.630> pass<00:03:47.930> around<00:03:48.230> 30<00:03:48.500> the<00:03:48.680> scavenger

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.160 
didn't know pass around 30 the scavenger

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.190 
didn't know pass around 30 the scavenger
is<00:03:49.310> no<00:03:49.520> longer<00:03:49.790> a<00:03:49.940> one-shot<00:03:50.510> kill<00:03:50.690> and<00:03:51.050> as<00:03:51.170> a

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
is no longer a one-shot kill and as a

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.350 
is no longer a one-shot kill and as a
result<00:03:51.620> there<00:03:52.070> could<00:03:52.220> be<00:03:52.250> instances<00:03:52.760> where<00:03:53.000> it

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
result there could be instances where it

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.690 
result there could be instances where it
might<00:03:53.600> take<00:03:54.050> two<00:03:54.710> shots<00:03:55.010> to<00:03:55.340> kill<00:03:55.550> a<00:03:55.580> zombie

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
might take two shots to kill a zombie

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.610 
might take two shots to kill a zombie
sometimes<00:03:56.360> even<00:03:56.630> three<00:03:56.900> in<00:03:57.110> the<00:03:57.200> later<00:03:57.440> rounds

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
sometimes even three in the later rounds

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.260 
sometimes even three in the later rounds
and<00:03:57.980> that<00:03:58.190> means<00:03:58.430> going<00:03:58.640> to<00:03:58.820> high<00:03:58.940> rounds

00:03:59.260 --> 00:03:59.270 
and that means going to high rounds

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.570 
and that means going to high rounds
insanely<00:03:59.930> difficult<00:04:00.290> and<00:04:00.710> time-consuming<00:04:01.010> as

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 
insanely difficult and time-consuming as

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.040 
insanely difficult and time-consuming as
you're<00:04:01.730> always<00:04:01.880> spinning<00:04:02.390> the<00:04:02.480> box<00:04:02.690> for<00:04:02.900> more

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
you're always spinning the box for more

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:05.290 
you're always spinning the box for more
scavenger<00:04:03.620> ammo<00:04:03.950> it's<00:04:04.490> a<00:04:04.610> wonder<00:04:04.880> weapon<00:04:05.180> so

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.300 
scavenger ammo it's a wonder weapon so

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.600 
scavenger ammo it's a wonder weapon so
of<00:04:05.480> course<00:04:05.780> it<00:04:05.960> should<00:04:05.990> always<00:04:06.440> be<00:04:06.620> a<00:04:07.010> one-shot

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
of course it should always be a one-shot

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:09.400 
of course it should always be a one-shot
kill<00:04:07.640> in<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.270> later<00:04:08.480> rounds<00:04:08.720> but<00:04:09.020> for<00:04:09.200> some

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
kill in the later rounds but for some

kill in the later rounds but for some
reason<00:04:09.770> on<00:04:09.830> the<00:04:09.920> map<00:04:10.040> called<00:04:10.310> the<00:04:10.460> dead<00:04:10.670> it<00:04:10.880> is

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:11.540 
reason on the map called the dead it is

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.750 
reason on the map called the dead it is
not<00:04:11.960> and<00:04:12.380> I<00:04:12.470> think<00:04:12.500> that<00:04:12.920> is<00:04:13.100> absurd<00:04:13.550> this

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:13.760 
not and I think that is absurd this

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.210 
not and I think that is absurd this
weapon<00:04:14.150> is<00:04:14.300> a<00:04:14.570> beast<00:04:15.170> and<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.740> say<00:04:15.980> it<00:04:16.070> should

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.220 
weapon is a beast and I say it should

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.710 
weapon is a beast and I say it should

had<00:04:35.450> some<00:04:35.600> pretty<00:04:35.780> good<00:04:35.960> ideas<00:04:36.020> we'll<00:04:36.830> start

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
had some pretty good ideas we'll start

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:38.590 
had some pretty good ideas we'll start
off<00:04:37.250> with<00:04:37.280> the<00:04:37.490> minecraft<00:04:37.910> king<00:04:38.150> who<00:04:38.330> said

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
off with the minecraft king who said

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.930 
off with the minecraft king who said
make<00:04:39.320> is<00:04:39.650> 2<00:04:39.980> you<00:04:40.160> can<00:04:40.340> set<00:04:40.550> it<00:04:40.640> to<00:04:40.670> where<00:04:40.820> the

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
make is 2 you can set it to where the

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.820 
make is 2 you can set it to where the
lander<00:04:41.330> goes<00:04:41.600> instead<00:04:41.990> of<00:04:42.200> just<00:04:42.350> going<00:04:42.560> to<00:04:42.710> the

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
lander goes instead of just going to the

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.400 
lander goes instead of just going to the
spawn<00:04:43.160> room<00:04:43.580> so<00:04:44.419> first<00:04:44.690> off<00:04:44.870> you<00:04:45.020> may<00:04:45.200> just

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
spawn room so first off you may just

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.380 
spawn room so first off you may just
want<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.710> check<00:04:45.860> up<00:04:46.040> on<00:04:46.070> your<00:04:46.580> grammar<00:04:46.940> but<00:04:47.330> I

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
want to check up on your grammar but I

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.300 
want to check up on your grammar but I
think<00:04:47.810> this<00:04:47.960> is<00:04:48.110> also<00:04:48.320> a<00:04:48.530> pretty<00:04:48.710> cool<00:04:48.890> idea<00:04:49.010> we

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:49.310 
think this is also a pretty cool idea we

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.770 
think this is also a pretty cool idea we
have<00:04:49.460> these<00:04:49.580> control<00:04:50.030> pads<00:04:50.240> in<00:04:50.419> front<00:04:50.660> of<00:04:50.720> the

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
have these control pads in front of the

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.390 
have these control pads in front of the
lunar<00:04:51.080> landers<00:04:51.410> although<00:04:51.710> all<00:04:51.919> we<00:04:52.100> can<00:04:52.250> do

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
lunar landers although all we can do

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.460 
lunar landers although all we can do
with<00:04:52.520> them<00:04:52.700> is<00:04:52.940> call<00:04:53.390> the<00:04:53.630> lunar<00:04:53.930> landers<00:04:54.320> I

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
with them is call the lunar landers I

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.650 
with them is call the lunar landers I
think<00:04:55.070> we<00:04:55.190> should<00:04:55.370> have<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:55.700> ability<00:04:56.090> to<00:04:56.120> set

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
think we should have the ability to set

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.659 
think we should have the ability to set
where<00:04:56.870> the<00:04:56.990> lunar<00:04:57.320> lander<00:04:57.650> goes<00:04:57.890> and<00:04:58.130> then

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
where the lunar lander goes and then

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.370 
where the lunar lander goes and then
once<00:04:58.940> we<00:04:59.090> go<00:04:59.240> on<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.510> ladder<00:04:59.690> it<00:04:59.900> will<00:05:00.020> take<00:05:00.230> us

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:00.380 
once we go on the ladder it will take us

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.960 
once we go on the ladder it will take us

to that location although I think this

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:03.250 
to that location although I think this

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
should be something that's done once all

should be something that's done once all

the Easter Egg yeah I think this is also
another<00:05:15.260> great<00:05:15.590> idea<00:05:16.130> if<00:05:16.250> you<00:05:16.280> don't<00:05:16.490> know

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 
another great idea if you don't know

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.950 
another great idea if you don't know
during<00:05:16.760> the<00:05:16.910> easter<00:05:17.210> egg<00:05:17.270> there's<00:05:17.480> this<00:05:17.660> clock

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 
during the easter egg there's this clock

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.330 
during the easter egg there's this clock
by<00:05:18.169> the<00:05:18.230> pact<00:05:18.440> upon<00:05:18.680> true<00:05:18.860> that<00:05:19.040> you<00:05:19.130> have<00:05:19.250> to

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
by the pact upon true that you have to

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.880 
by the pact upon true that you have to
sit<00:05:19.490> on<00:05:19.520> this<00:05:19.729> pad<00:05:19.970> for<00:05:20.780> about<00:05:21.050> like<00:05:21.320> 10<00:05:21.590> years

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:21.890 
sit on this pad for about like 10 years

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:23.440 
sit on this pad for about like 10 years
or<00:05:22.040> so<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.550> then<00:05:22.669> at<00:05:22.790> the<00:05:22.910> end<00:05:22.940> of<00:05:23.180> it<00:05:23.270> you've

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:23.450 
or so and then at the end of it you've

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.120 
or so and then at the end of it you've
completed<00:05:23.870> the<00:05:24.050> step<00:05:24.260> of<00:05:24.410> the<00:05:24.560> easter<00:05:24.890> egg<00:05:25.010> but

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
completed the step of the easter egg but

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.190 
completed the step of the easter egg but
each<00:05:25.280> is<00:05:25.460> really<00:05:25.760> ridiculously<00:05:26.540> long<00:05:26.810> it's

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
each is really ridiculously long it's

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.020 
each is really ridiculously long it's
almost<00:05:27.380> pointless<00:05:27.740> what<00:05:28.430> challenge<00:05:28.850> are<00:05:28.940> we

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
almost pointless what challenge are we

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.550 
almost pointless what challenge are we
getting<00:05:29.270> from<00:05:29.419> just<00:05:29.600> sitting<00:05:29.960> on<00:05:30.110> a<00:05:30.169> pad<00:05:30.530> with

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
getting from just sitting on a pad with

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:32.710 
getting from just sitting on a pad with
the<00:05:30.890> crawler<00:05:31.220> it's<00:05:31.580> really<00:05:32.030> stupid

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
the crawler it's really stupid

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.320 
the crawler it's really stupid
another<00:05:33.410> idea<00:05:33.560> from<00:05:33.890> Apollo<00:05:34.190> Creed<00:05:34.610> jr.<00:05:35.000> says

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
another idea from Apollo Creed jr. says

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.300 
another idea from Apollo Creed jr. says
when<00:05:35.750> you<00:05:35.840> destroy<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:36.380> rocket<00:05:36.620> they<00:05:37.100> should

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
when you destroy the rocket they should

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.920 
when you destroy the rocket they should
give<00:05:37.490> you<00:05:37.640> the<00:05:37.790> ability<00:05:38.000> to<00:05:38.210> search<00:05:38.510> in<00:05:38.810> the

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
give you the ability to search in the

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.080 
give you the ability to search in the
debris<00:05:39.350> for<00:05:39.590> various<00:05:40.010> items<00:05:40.280> and<00:05:40.580> maybe<00:05:40.820> even

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
debris for various items and maybe even

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.240 
debris for various items and maybe even
perks<00:05:41.479> I<00:05:41.660> think<00:05:41.840> this<00:05:41.960> is<00:05:42.140> also<00:05:42.410> a<00:05:42.620> pretty<00:05:42.919> cool

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
perks I think this is also a pretty cool

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.520 
perks I think this is also a pretty cool
idea<00:05:43.400> maybe<00:05:43.790> we<00:05:43.940> can<00:05:44.090> get<00:05:44.150> some<00:05:44.360> ammo<00:05:44.540> perks<00:05:45.289> if

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:45.530 
idea maybe we can get some ammo perks if

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:47.839 
idea maybe we can get some ammo perks if
we're<00:05:45.740> really<00:05:45.979> lucky<00:05:46.160> or<00:05:46.700> just<00:05:47.180> drops<00:05:47.510> at

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
we're really lucky or just drops at

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.179 
we're really lucky or just drops at
that's<00:05:48.029> a<00:05:48.119> fantastic<00:05:48.449> idea<00:05:48.839> and<00:05:49.199> then<00:05:49.860> we<00:05:49.889> have

00:05:50.179 --> 00:05:50.189 
that's a fantastic idea and then we have
