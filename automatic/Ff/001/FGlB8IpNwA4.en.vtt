tech man and today I wanted to do
something<00:00:11.969> a<00:00:12.030> little<00:00:12.240> different<00:00:12.660> than<00:00:12.840> just

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
something a little different than just

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.140 
the tops of the week and just to review
an<00:00:15.389> application<00:00:15.450> called<00:00:16.170> DSC<00:00:16.949> monitor<00:00:17.460> okay

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
an application called DSC monitor okay

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.060 
an application called DSC monitor okay
so<00:00:18.210> for<00:00:18.539> starters<00:00:18.930> this<00:00:19.109> application<00:00:19.710> is<00:00:19.830> free

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
so for starters this application is free

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.800 
so for starters this application is free
and<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.609> initial<00:00:21.000> idea<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.600> application

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
and the initial idea of this application

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.679 
and the initial idea of this application
is<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:23.039> determine<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.730> monthly<00:00:23.970> consumption

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
is to determine the monthly consumption

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.769 
is to determine the monthly consumption
of<00:00:24.840> mobile<00:00:25.170> data<00:00:25.310> talktime<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.519> sms<00:00:27.119> in<00:00:27.359> order

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
of mobile data talktime and sms in order

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.929 
of mobile data talktime and sms in order
to<00:00:27.930> predict<00:00:28.260> your<00:00:28.380> future<00:00:28.439> consumptions<00:00:29.250> for

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
to predict your future consumptions for

estimated amount of data or talktime

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.470 
estimated amount of data or talktime
they<00:00:50.010> will<00:00:50.219> use<00:00:50.370> in<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.640> future<00:00:50.670> or<00:00:51.239> the

they will use in the future or the
following<00:00:51.780> month<00:00:52.079> now<00:00:52.649> it's<00:00:52.800> really<00:00:53.039> simple

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
following month now it's really simple

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.760 
following month now it's really simple
to<00:00:53.430> use<00:00:53.570> basically<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.899> a<00:00:54.930> forecast<00:00:55.440> tab

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
to use basically you have a forecast tab

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.160 
to use basically you have a forecast tab
telling<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.699> an<00:00:56.940> expected<00:00:57.539> consumption<00:00:58.050> of

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
telling you an expected consumption of

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.139 
telling you an expected consumption of
the<00:00:58.230> coming<00:00:58.530> month<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.699> last<00:00:59.910> four

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
the coming month and the last four

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.090 
the coming month and the last four
months<00:01:00.300> will<00:01:00.629> be<00:01:00.750> taken<00:01:01.199> into<00:01:01.440> account<00:01:01.559> to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
months will be taken into account to

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.579 
months will be taken into account to
make<00:01:02.370> these<00:01:02.579> predictions<00:01:02.960> so<00:01:03.960> the<00:01:04.140> longer<00:01:04.439> you

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
make these predictions so the longer you

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.649 
make these predictions so the longer you
have<00:01:04.680> the<00:01:04.860> application<00:01:04.890> installed<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.450> more

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
have the application installed the more

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.960 
have the application installed the more
exact<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.320> forecast<00:01:07.830> will<00:01:08.010> be<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.460> by

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
exact the forecast will be and by

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.640 
exact the forecast will be and by
tapping<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.540> recording<00:01:10.110> so<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.290> can<00:01:10.470> also

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
tapping on the recording so you can also

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
tapping on the recording so you can also
determine<00:01:10.890> whether<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.760> incoming<00:01:12.150> calls<00:01:12.510> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
determine whether the incoming calls and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.280 
determine whether the incoming calls and
SMS<00:01:13.680> should<00:01:14.130> be<00:01:14.250> taken<00:01:14.610> into<00:01:14.729> account<00:01:15.290> the

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
SMS should be taken into account the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.429 
SMS should be taken into account the
arrows<00:01:16.650> next<00:01:16.920> to<00:01:17.130> data<00:01:17.400> call<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.420> SMS<00:01:18.930> also

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
arrows next to data call and SMS also

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.749 
arrows next to data call and SMS also
indicate<00:01:19.860> whether<00:01:20.009> there<00:01:20.310> will<00:01:20.430> be<00:01:20.490> an

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
indicate whether there will be an

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.609 
indicate whether there will be an
increase<00:01:21.180> or<00:01:21.390> decrease<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:21.960> your<00:01:22.200> consumption

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
increase or decrease in your consumption

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.289 
increase or decrease in your consumption
but<00:01:23.490> don't<00:01:23.670> think<00:01:23.790> it's<00:01:23.970> going<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.119> be<00:01:24.270> a

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
but don't think it's going to be a

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:25.969 
but don't think it's going to be a
hundred<00:01:24.600> percent<00:01:24.720> accurate<00:01:25.530> because<00:01:25.680> it's

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
hundred percent accurate because it's

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.310 
hundred percent accurate because it's
not<00:01:26.130> going<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.580> be<00:01:26.729> it's<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.330> to<00:01:27.960> give<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.200> an

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
not going to be it's just to give you an

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.749 
not going to be it's just to give you an
idea<00:01:28.439> of<00:01:28.740> what<00:01:28.860> your<00:01:28.979> consumption<00:01:29.460> might<00:01:29.579> be

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
idea of what your consumption might be

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.580 
idea of what your consumption might be
in<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> following<00:01:30.270> month<00:01:30.570> now<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:31.470> the

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
in the following month now in the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.649 
in the following month now in the
current<00:01:31.979> tab<00:01:32.189> you<00:01:32.430> also<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:33.060> your<00:01:33.210> current

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
current tab you also have your current

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.510 
current tab you also have your current
consumption<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> current<00:01:35.250> billing

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
consumption for the current billing

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.700 
consumption for the current billing
month<00:01:35.880> and<00:01:36.150> by<00:01:36.570> default<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.200> first<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.619> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
month and by default the first of the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.469 
month and by default the first of the
month<00:01:37.920> is<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.610> recording<00:01:39.060> will<00:01:39.150> begin

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
month is one the recording will begin

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.719 
month is one the recording will begin
but<00:01:40.020> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.290> actually<00:01:40.500> adjust<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.400> your

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
but you can actually adjust that to your

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.940 
but you can actually adjust that to your
correct<00:01:42.210> billing<00:01:42.630> period<00:01:43.049> for<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> more

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
correct billing period for a more

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.370 
correct billing period for a more
accurate<00:01:44.360> usage<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.540> you<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.840> used<00:01:46.110> on

accurate usage that you have used on
your<00:01:46.560> phone<00:01:46.770> so<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:47.700> basically<00:01:48.180> DSC
