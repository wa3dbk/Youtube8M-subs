was making the interface for the Essex
easier<00:02:53.250> which<00:02:53.489> for<00:02:53.879> me<00:02:53.970> didn't<00:02:54.150> work<00:02:54.239> there

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
easier which for me didn't work there

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.910 
easier which for me didn't work there
because<00:02:54.720> I<00:02:54.780> was<00:02:54.900> looking<00:02:55.140> for<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.319> icon<00:02:55.680> and

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
because I was looking for the icon and

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.410 
because I was looking for the icon and
it's<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.459> text<00:02:56.819> and<00:02:56.909> that's<00:02:57.090> what<00:02:57.239> they've

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
it's the text and that's what they've

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.160 
it's the text and that's what they've
added<00:02:57.750> text<00:02:58.079> in<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.230> lot<00:02:58.379> of<00:02:58.409> places<00:02:59.329> so<00:03:00.329> you

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
added text in a lot of places so you

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.520 
added text in a lot of places so you
don't<00:03:01.500> have<00:03:01.799> to<00:03:02.129> be<00:03:02.900> try<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.959> figure<00:03:04.140> out<00:03:04.260> what

bit<00:03:54.470> and<00:03:54.760> awesome<00:03:55.760> device<00:03:55.910> almost<00:03:56.390> the<00:03:56.480> exact

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
bit and awesome device almost the exact

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.870 
bit and awesome device almost the exact
same<00:03:56.810> specs<00:03:57.380> the<00:03:58.130> difference<00:03:58.460> of<00:03:58.610> course<00:03:58.730> is

00:03:58.870 --> 00:03:58.880 
same specs the difference of course is

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.880 
same specs the difference of course is
the<00:03:59.030> curved<00:03:59.240> screen<00:03:59.600> and<00:04:00.020> if<00:04:00.320> you<00:04:00.440> look<00:04:00.650> at<00:04:00.860> the

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:00.890 
the curved screen and if you look at the

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.840 
the curved screen and if you look at the
note<00:04:01.580> edge<00:04:02.440> it<00:04:03.440> had<00:04:03.620> the<00:04:03.650> curve<00:04:04.100> on<00:04:04.310> one<00:04:04.550> side

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:04.850 
note edge it had the curve on one side

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.560 
note edge it had the curve on one side
and<00:04:05.180> straight<00:04:05.900> on<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.290> other<00:04:06.470> side<00:04:06.940> the<00:04:07.940> s6

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
and straight on the other side the s6

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.980 
and straight on the other side the s6
edge<00:04:09.380> has<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.400> curb<00:04:10.640> screen<00:04:11.030> on<00:04:11.240> both<00:04:11.630> sides

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
edge has the curb screen on both sides

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.700 
edge has the curb screen on both sides
and<00:04:12.350> it<00:04:12.860> is<00:04:13.040> a<00:04:13.070> pretty<00:04:13.700> cool<00:04:13.940> feature<00:04:14.710> it

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
and it is a pretty cool feature it

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.710 
and it is a pretty cool feature it
definitely<00:04:16.220> has<00:04:16.489> some<00:04:16.700> wow<00:04:16.850> factor<00:04:16.880> there<00:04:17.540> I

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
definitely has some wow factor there I

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.200 
definitely has some wow factor there I
haven't<00:04:18.350> used<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.860> edge<00:04:19.040> at<00:04:19.370> length<00:04:19.730> so<00:04:20.060> I'm

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:20.210 
haven't used the edge at length so I'm

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.150 
haven't used the edge at length so I'm
not<00:04:20.360> sure<00:04:20.600> exactly<00:04:20.960> how<00:04:21.140> we<00:04:21.200> feel<00:04:21.530> but<00:04:21.920> it<00:04:22.010> does

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
not sure exactly how we feel but it does

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.440 
not sure exactly how we feel but it does
bring<00:04:22.310> some<00:04:22.610> extra<00:04:22.790> features<00:04:23.540> as<00:04:23.990> well

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:26.450 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.750 

for<00:04:27.020> example<00:04:27.530> there's<00:04:28.040> a<00:04:28.130> ringing<00:04:28.460> feature

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
for example there's a ringing feature

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.360 
for example there's a ringing feature
when<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.090> have<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.360> face<00:04:29.570> down<00:04:29.920> the<00:04:30.920> light

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:31.370 
when you have it face down the light

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.730 
when you have it face down the light
from<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.760> screen<00:04:31.910> will<00:04:32.690> illuminate<00:04:33.410> the

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:33.740 
from the screen will illuminate the

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.010 
from the screen will illuminate the
surface<00:04:34.250> below<00:04:34.460> and<00:04:34.910> depending<00:04:35.720> on<00:04:35.840> what

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
surface below and depending on what

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.260 
surface below and depending on what
color<00:04:36.260> it<00:04:36.440> is<00:04:36.530> it<00:04:37.100> will<00:04:37.340> tell<00:04:37.520> you<00:04:37.730> who's

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
color it is it will tell you who's

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.850 
color it is it will tell you who's
calling<00:04:38.750> or<00:04:38.870> ringing<00:04:39.290> and<00:04:39.440> you<00:04:39.500> can<00:04:39.680> set

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 
calling or ringing and you can set

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:41.320 
calling or ringing and you can set
different<00:04:40.010> colors<00:04:40.460> for<00:04:40.490> different<00:04:40.670> contracts

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:41.330 
different colors for different contracts

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.950 
different colors for different contracts
so<00:04:41.840> that's<00:04:42.050> a<00:04:42.260> pretty<00:04:42.650> awesome<00:04:43.630> feature<00:04:44.630> there

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
so that's a pretty awesome feature there

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.990 
so that's a pretty awesome feature there
so<00:04:45.560> besides<00:04:45.980> that<00:04:46.340> the<00:04:46.490> two<00:04:46.640> are<00:04:46.670> the<00:04:46.820> same

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
so besides that the two are the same

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.290 
so besides that the two are the same
both<00:04:47.300> these<00:04:47.450> devices<00:04:48.070> really<00:04:49.070> I<00:04:49.400> think<00:04:49.970> a

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
both these devices really I think a

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.720 
both these devices really I think a
diversion<00:04:50.930> from<00:04:51.140> previous<00:04:51.710> Galaxy<00:04:52.610> devices

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
diversion from previous Galaxy devices

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.160 
diversion from previous Galaxy devices
in<00:04:53.210> that<00:04:53.420> this<00:04:54.020> it's<00:04:54.380> all<00:04:54.620> super<00:04:55.370> solid

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:56.170 
in that this it's all super solid

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:58.900 
in that this it's all super solid
batteries<00:04:57.170> in<00:04:57.470> there<00:04:57.680> can't<00:04:58.070> take<00:04:58.160> it<00:04:58.400> out<00:04:58.580> the

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
batteries in there can't take it out the

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.660 
batteries in there can't take it out the
memories<00:04:59.660> in<00:04:59.840> there<00:05:00.050> no<00:05:00.440> SD<00:05:00.650> card<00:05:01.130> but<00:05:01.640> it

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:01.670 
memories in there no SD card but it

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.270 
memories in there no SD card but it
feels<00:05:02.000> super<00:05:02.450> solid<00:05:02.840> super<00:05:03.200> premium<00:05:03.440> and<00:05:04.010> it's

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
feels super solid super premium and it's

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.860 
feels super solid super premium and it's
something<00:05:04.580> really<00:05:04.790> exciting<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.360> see<00:05:05.540> from

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
something really exciting to see from

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.140
