00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.369
 more seriously I think the work would stop seeing 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:24.009
 the evolution of this project 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.460
 between the first time all the associations and see them again 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.760
 I remember with his class 40 km to the refusal of not resemble themselves for the 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.670
 migrant people 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.410
 and after the project is accepted 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.800
 and I think they did not really know in which way it's going to take a 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.540
 story that it leads to something concrete 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.940
 as to the evolution between them 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.300
 the actual start at the end of these parades the finish 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.730
 and in the meantime the work of leaving my children with him and I think that it has 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.140
 really 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.350
 open to other things in the dimension of projects opened the 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.560
 dimension partnership I think he is a little isolated with his idea 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.510
 if you really think I thought really innovative and also our sales 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.510
 is a carrier at the start and I think that without the meeting with the well knows 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.260
 the preparation and all that thanks to its opening dimensions 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.000
 organize a parade he is invited denis 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.830
 the departmental association was pleased to return to the match and I 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.130
 learned a lot 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.040
 and percent since the manikin is at the law to give a 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.650
 date February 2, 2005 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.670
 besides, as a designer, our activity is done to form an opinion 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.210
 conducted after daily occupation 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.610
 now that it's not my fault the summer we hear people for the 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.520
 people with disabilities talk about it because we bring back to 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.910
 designers of furniture from 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.000
 in front of us 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.680
 it's how do they take things how are theirs 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.260
 needs what are their concerns so for this round 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.490
 it's his impressions 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.990
 so she herself first on tf1 when asked to wear the title does not 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.870
 would be that in that of two chairs this donation spinning it was very 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.800
 very fast 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.800
 and especially I will be ready on Saturday face reindeer 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:09.989
 so 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.299
 I hope this type of pick up and clothes will develop very 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:18.230
 quickly on the market so at first I did not quite understand that 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.499
 it's the garment% this country has a little bit of a special say 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.840
 the experts did not this time at all in fact he simply 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.329
 to enlist m 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.489
 its closing was with prayers and the delcros that one perceives 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.059
 that indeed a difference 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.339
 because if not less visually the afpa difference 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:38.589
 then the difference that we see badly when we actually see them 

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:39.549
 overtures 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.549
 Europe is good for foie gras filet 

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:47.039
 so in fact it was to them that I found it interesting 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:50.709
 but that did not change anything 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:53.680
 to the beauty of clothes actually it was funny that I never did 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.510
 it's good enough it's pretty funny 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.629
 the mayor 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:58.299
 I see it friendly 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.829
 in the next few months they were photographed I was not waiting for it 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:06.510
 really it was nice to see stupidly run m jensen not by me I like 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:09.319
 well the masters are nice and then 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:12.209
 I'm ready over five years to save the passage is 100 sponsorships 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.669
 required 

00:03:13.669 --> 00:03:16.789
 most will be held abbas place has carried several deputies to the 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:18.169
 then asks 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.849
 the team did not know or I need an hour otherwise a 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:22.949
 church the cold 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.949
 mistake of fact despite a different cool weather that's when there 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.469
 it's really suitable evening gendarmes 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.769
 she was born and apprehensive 

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:36.089
 The report 

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:37.399
 your critics 

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:39.579
 to know if people 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.979
 we did not like him finally 

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:43.329
 they are happy enough 

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:44.919
 sometimes this election 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.919
 it is actually puy be proud 

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:50.449
 dating 

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:53.069
 at the musical level 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:54.529
 the level of personal life 

00:03:54.529 --> 00:03:56.419
 ap the quite 

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:59.419
 a valid person the very wearer 

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:02.489
 that's actually the side 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.959
 fassi fihri 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:07.659
 openings made too much pressure 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.269
 and for those who were 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:11.279
 work on the entire island 

00:04:11.279 --> 00:04:12.999
 the collection 

00:04:12.999 --> 00:04:15.999
 side sports tourer areas of everyday wear 

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.629
 malaria 

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:21.509
 thanks to his positions on this case 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.509
 it's very very interesting very lively montreal 

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.659
 one that allowed to change I think that a lot of social representation that 

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:32.659
 people or property of people with disabilities 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:36.189
 hinges think we reached our goal is 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.930
 I would like it to be used in euros - to perpetuate the project christ 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.620
 because for now 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.120
 it remains fashionable adaptable aesthetics mans the leader 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:54.280
 but we should find partners for each of the two shoes 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.129
 on a form 

00:04:59.129 --> 00:05:02.220
 of course a cooperative formula something that allows 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.830
 to market to people with disabilities and this to a 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:08.310
 lower cost
