00:00:58.919 --> 00:00:58.929 
real time both ways the interesting part

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:01.079 
real time both ways the interesting part
is<00:00:59.019> that<00:00:59.079> it's<00:00:59.379> not<00:00:59.530> just<00:00:59.559> to<00:01:00.190> check<00:01:00.550> what

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:01.089 
is that it's not just to check what

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:02.669 
is that it's not just to check what
happened<00:01:01.449> it's<00:01:01.629> also<00:01:01.809> for<00:01:02.199> controlling

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
happened it's also for controlling

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:05.580
