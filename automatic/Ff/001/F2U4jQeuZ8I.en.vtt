00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.760
 a while ago we were able to 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.800
 establish that honda in the compact 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.410
 segment and want something adventurous course 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.080
 went sailing and with the arrival of the hrv 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.340
 a compact suv now comes a second one 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.320
 model with about the same 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.150
 outside dimensions because this is the third 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.130
 generation of jazz 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.779
 and despite this bright colors, this is 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.550
 actually a car at first 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.660
 face a little better fits a wat 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.660
 marital lifestyle 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.750
 I mean that in the 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.940
 positive sense of the word because the 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.250
 honda jazz has been such a thing for years 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.800
 car where you hardly fall bump 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.899
 one of the most practical and convenient 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.030
 choices in the segment is also typical 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.379
 such a car that I recommend as people 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.570
 say what kind of car should I buy 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.460
 and then they say yes I have a lot of space 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.830
 I want affordability I want practicality 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.299
 employability and reliability yes and then 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.250
 do you, as far as I'm concerned, come in one 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.530
 honda jazz about that affordability 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.270
 compared to an HRV 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.780
 it to start with and much cheaper 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.280
 car and jazz starts at 17800 they are under 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.610
 there and 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.380
 and hrv that costs just 25,000 euros 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.369
 He is really a blow you lower 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.350
 the ladder 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.819
 and the comparison with competitors 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:35.069
 like a missle note then it does 

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:35.940
 downright neat about that practical 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:37.440
 usability we will do it later 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.690
 have a little moment but first I want to 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.060
 the space on board handles the jets 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.369
 in 95 mm long they are then be 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.989
 predecessor but four centimeters thereof 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.450
 disappears in a new front bumper 

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:49.910
 who has grown to become better 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.569
 score in the pedestrians 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.379
 safety tests 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:54.209
 the rest of the interior is 

00:01:52.379 --> 00:01:56.039
 mainly behind someone taller 

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:59.160
 and that ensures that you 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.709
 for this still in relative 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.929
 tight under claims then very proudly 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.789
 they mix according to the principle mine 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:07.649
 machine minimum have worked in it 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:09.209
 interior or as much as possible 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.340
 freedom of movement for people 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.739
 board but frankly I'm with 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.930
 my two meters four is the maximum 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.730
 man what you comfortable in a jets 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.540
 I just can't get lost 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:20.910
 yummy 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.459
 My knees have is a little space 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.200
 little focus on the steering wheel is broken 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.599
 better adjustable than before 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.550
 but if you really put a coarse 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.500
 I will say so 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.610
 then you say not so good in this car 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.610
 So that's something about bills 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.220
 must say that the design of 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.570
 the interior reasonable 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:47.150
 it has definitely improved 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.350
 a lot more modern than we of the jets 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.210
 were used to 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.640
 and with that is an important tip 

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:54.590
 go for the second equipment level 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.150
 the jets that is the comfort 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.120
 because then you get this relatively modern 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:01.250
 looking dog connect system that is 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.750
 A control system works on Android 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:04.940
 has all kinds of modern amenities 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:07.520
 bluetooth and link with mirror link 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.230
 such works pretty well 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.540
 neat air conditioning job that you are also under 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.130
 what comfort from arguing that photos is 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.230
 another advantage because you get the 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.130
 ted-wish driving es ist package there immediately 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:17.209
 at 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.489
 and it means that the car is 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.830
 equipped with a system that 

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:24.020
 Road signs recognized and then immediately 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.450
 adjust the speed limiter you have 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.400
 lane departure warning system and so that 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.720
 are all sorts of things that the car does 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.110
 making it safer so that is absolute 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.110
 recommend 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:52.690
 what is less fine is the fact that jazz 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:54.400
 actually offers no choice in engines 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.709
 previously we had 1 and 2 and one 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.270
 1 point four that are both out the door 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.640
 replaced by a one point 3 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:02.290
 4 cylinder without turbo with one hundred and 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.360
 two horsepower 

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.310
 and then you can choose from one 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.290
 manual six-speed gearbox that is also new 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.959
 what was previously a 5-speed 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.880
 and a continuously variable machine and 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.760
 that's all great being a baker 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:18.010
 good but that motor is but there is 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:20.019
 minimum 102hp would say that is 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.150
 enough for a car of this size 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.610
 and it is but once you get more 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:26.139
 the desire starts then the engine shoots 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.669
 actually a bit short in it 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.540
 comparison with what we know in this 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:30.430
 segment 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.950
 it has 123 minutes of torque 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.270
 and for example if you are on the highway 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.490
 sit-ins and sixth gear and you want 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:38.320
 catch up with another car from now on 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.419
 then it really takes a while before 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.419
 the car then you give responds to 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:47.620
 switches back then you go back then comes 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:49.060
 A bit of life in it, but really 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.430
 it doesn't feel modern at all and that is 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:55.140
 a pity because with div tag technology 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.140
 it is a very free block 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:05.930
 look then who wants to let them do so much 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.820
 have trains because in it 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.130
 honda says they have the jets 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.330
 equipped with a European chassis 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.890
 that is, they give him a hand 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.090
 have made it harder in comparison 

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:15.740
 with its predecessor 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.480
 and if you're driving like that 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.610
 You also notice that within seconds 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.100
 say the first few centimeters 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:23.900
 van der veer road that is fairly sturdy 

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:26.540
 in addition , you feel a lot of irregularities 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.670
 in coming through in the interior 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.220
 do you really go harder and you have 

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.350
 larger bumps than absorb the 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.600
 feathers and james it very smoothly 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.090
 steering is also more direct for a while 22 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.950
 half a percent and just expected 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.660
 absolutely no super 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:43.580
 sporty car or something like that 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:45.320
 so a very nice clear communication 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.390
 the car with the nicely bent out 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.710
 chassis 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:51.850
 but it is simply spectacular 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.850
 not and they didn't know that 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.100
 so the first conclusion seems 

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:04.140
 justified with a new honda 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:06.150
 jazz you a car for your door 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:07.410
 reasonable reason 

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.910
 sufficient modern amenities 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:10.440
 board and that combines with one 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.060
 fair price 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:14.120
 one thing remains for us 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.120
 board 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:24.059
 to start with the luggage room 

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:27.809
 is quite useful you have a free one 

00:06:24.059 --> 00:06:29.039
 low lift threshold a large opening and 354 

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:31.169
 stapling at your disposal 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.409
 so great for daily practice 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:35.849
 each other and honda would of course not be 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.259
 if they are not properly hinged 

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:38.459
 have rear seats mounted and that 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:40.769
 do they have because this is 

00:06:38.459 --> 00:06:42.449
 when it's all very simple 

00:06:40.769 --> 00:06:44.459
 if you raise it again it will come 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:46.379
 next trick out of the sleeve for the 

00:06:44.459 --> 00:06:48.389
 magic seats also survived 

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:50.369
 who are again with one 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.689
 difference because the space here is 

00:06:50.369 --> 00:06:53.519
 as I said, what increased and that 

00:06:51.689 --> 00:06:55.889
 has another big advantage because this one 

00:06:53.519 --> 00:06:59.490
 front seat is at its rear position 

00:06:55.889 --> 00:07:02.029
 and I still see very well 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.029
 that deserves praise 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.140
 as if that is not enough 

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:09.630
 still or do you need a kind 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:11.520
 relaxation seats and which leaves once too 

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:13.560
 more that the honda jazz par excellence 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.590
 suitable for people with an active 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.590
 lifestyle
