00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.580 

I've<00:00:05.830> just<00:00:06.040> created<00:00:06.520> a<00:00:06.720> hollow<00:00:07.720> form<00:00:08.080> vessel

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:08.590 
I've just created a hollow form vessel

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.560 
I've just created a hollow form vessel
here<00:00:08.830> with<00:00:09.040> a<00:00:09.070> fairly<00:00:09.639> large<00:00:09.820> mouth<00:00:10.180> opening

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:10.570 
here with a fairly large mouth opening

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.320 
here with a fairly large mouth opening
so<00:00:10.750> we<00:00:10.870> can<00:00:11.020> see<00:00:11.230> what's<00:00:11.440> going<00:00:11.530> on<00:00:11.920> and<00:00:12.490> I<00:00:13.150> want

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
so we can see what's going on and I want

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:18.000 
so we can see what's going on and I want
to<00:00:13.420> talk<00:00:13.600> about<00:00:14.430> tool<00:00:15.430> control<00:00:16.860> and<00:00:17.860> it

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.010 
to talk about tool control and it

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.240 
to talk about tool control and it
doesn't<00:00:18.310> matter<00:00:18.460> what<00:00:19.500> boring<00:00:20.500> bar<00:00:20.680> you<00:00:20.890> using

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:21.250 
doesn't matter what boring bar you using

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.769 
doesn't matter what boring bar you using
what<00:00:21.460> system<00:00:21.849> you're<00:00:21.970> using<00:00:22.179> but<00:00:22.539> tool

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
what system you're using but tool

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.409 
what system you're using but tool
control<00:00:23.080> is<00:00:23.170> really<00:00:23.289> important<00:00:23.859> to<00:00:24.550> prevent

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:25.419 
control is really important to prevent

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:27.509 
control is really important to prevent
vibration<00:00:25.990> while<00:00:26.560> we're<00:00:26.740> working<00:00:26.859> inside<00:00:27.339> the

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:27.519 
vibration while we're working inside the

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:30.779 
vibration while we're working inside the
hollow<00:00:27.669> form<00:00:27.970> okay<00:00:28.660> so<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:30.160> first<00:00:30.339> thing<00:00:30.519> is

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:30.789 
hollow form okay so the first thing is

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:32.940 
hollow form okay so the first thing is
is<00:00:31.119> really<00:00:31.449> having<00:00:31.810> a<00:00:31.990> sharp<00:00:32.259> tool<00:00:32.500> we<00:00:32.680> need<00:00:32.860> to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
is really having a sharp tool we need to

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.770 
is really having a sharp tool we need to
have<00:00:33.070> a<00:00:33.100> very<00:00:33.430> sharp<00:00:33.640> tool<00:00:33.910> so<00:00:34.180> have<00:00:34.360> a<00:00:34.390> fresh

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
have a very sharp tool so have a fresh

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.580 
have a very sharp tool so have a fresh
new<00:00:34.810> burr<00:00:35.230> on<00:00:35.500> your<00:00:36.250> cutter<00:00:36.809> or<00:00:37.809> be<00:00:38.050> using<00:00:38.410> the

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
new burr on your cutter or be using the

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.349 
new burr on your cutter or be using the
the<00:00:39.629> hunter<00:00:40.629> nano<00:00:41.020> grain<00:00:41.260> carbide<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:42.940> always

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
the hunter nano grain carbide is always

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:45.599 
the hunter nano grain carbide is always
going<00:00:43.539> to<00:00:43.570> be<00:00:43.629> that<00:00:43.840> razor<00:00:44.109> sharp<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:44.890> you<00:00:45.160> want

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:45.609 
going to be that razor sharp so you want

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:48.569 
going to be that razor sharp so you want
to<00:00:45.699> be<00:00:45.789> starting<00:00:46.149> with<00:00:46.210> a<00:00:46.270> sharp<00:00:46.539> tool<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:48.579 
to be starting with a sharp tool the

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.020 
to be starting with a sharp tool the
second<00:00:49.059> is<00:00:49.710> taking<00:00:50.710> light<00:00:50.949> cuts<00:00:51.309> what<00:00:51.910> we're

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
second is taking light cuts what we're

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.420 
second is taking light cuts what we're
going<00:00:52.180> to<00:00:52.210> do<00:00:52.390> is<00:00:52.539> we're<00:00:52.690> going<00:00:52.780> to<00:00:52.840> go<00:00:53.170> into<00:00:53.680> a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
going to do is we're going to go into a

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.750 
going to do is we're going to go into a
shoulder<00:00:55.590> where<00:00:56.590> we're<00:00:56.769> inside<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.370> vessel

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
shoulder where we're inside the vessel

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.939 
shoulder where we're inside the vessel
they're<00:00:58.420> going<00:00:58.539> to<00:00:58.600> go<00:00:58.719> across<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.559> bottom<00:00:59.710> of

00:00:59.939 --> 00:00:59.949 
they're going to go across the bottom of

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:01.439 
they're going to go across the bottom of
the<00:01:00.070> vessel<00:01:00.190> into<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.699> shoulder<00:01:01.179> and<00:01:01.300> we're

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
the vessel into a shoulder and we're

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:03.209 
the vessel into a shoulder and we're
gonna<00:01:01.539> make<00:01:01.780> a<00:01:01.809> cut<00:01:02.260> that's<00:01:02.769> going<00:01:02.949> to<00:01:03.129> be

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:03.219 
gonna make a cut that's going to be

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.700 
gonna make a cut that's going to be
relatively<00:01:03.760> small<00:01:04.239> I<00:01:04.570> want<00:01:05.110> to<00:01:05.170> make<00:01:05.290> the<00:01:05.440> cut

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
relatively small I want to make the cut

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.590 
relatively small I want to make the cut
happen<00:01:06.070> only<00:01:06.280> at<00:01:06.610> the<00:01:06.820> tip<00:01:07.150> and<00:01:07.180> we're<00:01:07.540> only

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
happen only at the tip and we're only

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.210 
happen only at the tip and we're only
going<00:01:07.810> to<00:01:07.900> use<00:01:08.050> maybe<00:01:08.350> an<00:01:08.620> eighth<00:01:08.770> of<00:01:08.950> an<00:01:09.100> inch

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
going to use maybe an eighth of an inch

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.400 
going to use maybe an eighth of an inch
of<00:01:09.550> the<00:01:09.700> tip<00:01:09.940> and<00:01:10.150> then<00:01:10.780> I'm<00:01:10.900> going<00:01:10.990> to<00:01:11.050> advance

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
of the tip and then I'm going to advance

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.590 
of the tip and then I'm going to advance
it<00:01:11.620> into<00:01:11.830> the<00:01:11.950> shoulder<00:01:12.310> again<00:01:12.610> and<00:01:13.360> make

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
it into the shoulder again and make

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.540 
it into the shoulder again and make
another<00:01:13.630> cut<00:01:14.170> an<00:01:14.290> eighth<00:01:14.410> of<00:01:14.590> an<00:01:14.710> inch<00:01:14.830> so

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
another cut an eighth of an inch so

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.360 
another cut an eighth of an inch so
we're<00:01:15.790> only<00:01:15.910> using<00:01:16.180> just<00:01:16.630> a<00:01:16.810> tip<00:01:17.050> what<00:01:17.770> I<00:01:17.830> the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
we're only using just a tip what I the

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.290 
we're only using just a tip what I the
thing<00:01:18.610> that's<00:01:18.850> going<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.060> cause<00:01:19.270> some

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
thing that's going to cause some

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.320 
thing that's going to cause some
vibration<00:01:20.050> is<00:01:20.260> if<00:01:20.800> I<00:01:20.950> wrap<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.490> shaving<00:01:21.940> all<00:01:22.180> the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:22.330 
vibration is if I wrap a shaving all the

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.350 
vibration is if I wrap a shaving all the
way<00:01:22.450> around<00:01:23.490> by<00:01:24.490> pushing<00:01:25.000> towards<00:01:25.300> the

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
way around by pushing towards the

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.210 
way around by pushing towards the
headstock<00:01:25.840> I<00:01:26.020> can<00:01:26.200> wrap<00:01:26.380> a<00:01:26.410> shaving<00:01:26.950> all<00:01:27.100> the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
headstock I can wrap a shaving all the

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.190 
headstock I can wrap a shaving all the
way<00:01:27.310> around<00:01:27.580> and<00:01:27.760> make<00:01:27.820> a<00:01:27.940> big<00:01:28.480> shaving<00:01:28.990> come

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
way around and make a big shaving come

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.170 
way around and make a big shaving come
off<00:01:29.350> of<00:01:29.500> there<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:29.860> that's<00:01:30.430> going<00:01:30.670> to<00:01:30.790> limit

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
off of there and that's going to limit

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.990 
off of there and that's going to limit
how<00:01:32.110> fast<00:01:32.530> I<00:01:32.740> can<00:01:32.920> go<00:01:33.100> it's<00:01:33.430> going<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.730> start<00:01:33.910> to

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
how fast I can go it's going to start to

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.630 
how fast I can go it's going to start to
vibrate<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:35.140> so<00:01:35.320> I<00:01:35.350> have<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:35.710> slow<00:01:35.950> down<00:01:36.190> and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
vibrate and so I have to slow down and

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.420 
vibrate and so I have to slow down and
take<00:01:36.850> a<00:01:36.910> smaller<00:01:37.240> shaving<00:01:37.720> so<00:01:38.410> while<00:01:39.220> we're

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
take a smaller shaving so while we're

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.380 
take a smaller shaving so while we're
going<00:01:39.730> into<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.990> entry<00:01:41.470> hole<00:01:41.970> I'm<00:01:42.970> just<00:01:43.240> gonna

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
going into the entry hole I'm just gonna

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:46.260 
going into the entry hole I'm just gonna
come<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.900> the<00:01:43.990> left<00:01:44.670> I'm<00:01:45.670> gonna<00:01:45.820> make<00:01:46.030> a<00:01:46.060> little

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
come to the left I'm gonna make a little

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.330 
come to the left I'm gonna make a little
mark<00:01:46.690> on<00:01:46.900> here<00:01:47.140> so<00:01:47.320> you<00:01:47.350> can<00:01:47.650> visually<00:01:48.100> see<00:01:48.130> I

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
mark on here so you can visually see I

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.220 
mark on here so you can visually see I
watch<00:01:48.790> the<00:01:49.060> laser<00:01:49.300> but<00:01:49.630> I<00:01:49.660> want<00:01:49.900> you<00:01:50.050> to<00:01:50.080> be

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:50.230 
watch the laser but I want you to be

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:54.810 
watch the laser but I want you to be
able<00:01:50.410> to<00:01:50.470> see<00:01:51.240> the<00:01:52.240> advancement<00:01:53.430> right<00:01:54.430> here

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.060 
able to see the advancement right here
where<00:01:55.120> it's<00:01:55.270> going<00:01:55.570> in<00:01:55.690> the<00:01:55.900> column<00:01:56.710> so<00:01:56.920> I'm

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
where it's going in the column so I'm

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:59.310 
where it's going in the column so I'm
making<00:01:57.310> a<00:01:57.520> cut<00:01:57.820> and<00:01:58.450> I'm<00:01:58.600> gonna<00:01:58.720> advance<00:01:59.080> it

00:01:59.310 --> 00:01:59.320 
making a cut and I'm gonna advance it

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.130 
making a cut and I'm gonna advance it
just<00:01:59.470> a<00:01:59.560> little<00:01:59.710> bit<00:02:00.120> make<00:02:01.120> another<00:02:01.390> cut<00:02:01.690> it

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
just a little bit make another cut it

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.470 
just a little bit make another cut it
advances<00:02:02.650> just<00:02:02.800> a<00:02:02.830> little<00:02:03.040> bit<00:02:03.130> more<00:02:03.370> a<00:02:03.670> little

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
advances just a little bit more a little

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.720 
advances just a little bit more a little
cut<00:02:04.660> see<00:02:05.170> I'm<00:02:05.260> taking<00:02:05.440> very<00:02:05.830> small<00:02:06.370> increments

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:06.730 
cut see I'm taking very small increments

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.169 
cut see I'm taking very small increments
and<00:02:07.570> I<00:02:07.990> can<00:02:08.200> do<00:02:08.289> this<00:02:08.470> quick<00:02:08.950> and<00:02:08.979> fast<00:02:09.429> and

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
and I can do this quick and fast and

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:13.750 
and I can do this quick and fast and
efficiently<00:02:10.780> without<00:02:11.650> getting<00:02:12.010> vibration

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
efficiently without getting vibration

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.209 
efficiently without getting vibration
if<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:14.999> try<00:02:15.269> to<00:02:15.329> plunge<00:02:15.780> in<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.319> of<00:02:16.739> like<00:02:16.920> push

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.219 
if I try to plunge in to of like push

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.429 
if I try to plunge in to of like push
towards<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:18.359> headstock<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:18.989> plunge<00:02:19.230> in

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:19.439 
towards the headstock and plunge in

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.379 
towards the headstock and plunge in
there<00:02:19.650> then<00:02:20.219> I'm<00:02:20.370> gonna<00:02:20.519> wrap<00:02:20.760> around<00:02:20.790> too<00:02:21.239> big

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:21.389 
there then I'm gonna wrap around too big

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.170 
there then I'm gonna wrap around too big
of<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.540> shaving<00:02:21.930> okay<00:02:22.290> now<00:02:23.010> once<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.430> get<00:02:23.579> deeper

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
of a shaving okay now once I get deeper

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.839 
of a shaving okay now once I get deeper
and<00:02:24.209> deeper<00:02:24.389> into<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:25.499> vessel<00:02:25.889> the<00:02:26.579> boring

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
and deeper into the vessel the boring

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:29.869 
and deeper into the vessel the boring
bar<00:02:27.030> wants<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.599> start<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.379> vibrate<00:02:28.530> so<00:02:29.069> one<00:02:29.849> of

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
bar wants to start to vibrate so one of

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:31.520 
bar wants to start to vibrate so one of
the<00:02:30.060> tricks<00:02:30.299> is<00:02:30.599> to<00:02:30.629> pull<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.019> camera<00:02:31.230> back<00:02:31.349> a

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
the tricks is to pull the camera back a

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.140 
the tricks is to pull the camera back a
little<00:02:31.739> bit<00:02:31.920> because<00:02:32.340> I'm<00:02:32.609> going<00:02:32.760> to<00:02:32.819> put<00:02:32.879> my

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
little bit because I'm going to put my

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.690 
little bit because I'm going to put my
elbow<00:02:33.359> on<00:02:33.840> here<00:02:34.260> in<00:02:34.439> my<00:02:34.709> hand<00:02:34.980> back<00:02:35.189> here<00:02:35.459> so

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
elbow on here in my hand back here so

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.309 
elbow on here in my hand back here so
that<00:02:35.849> I'd<00:02:35.969> give<00:02:36.209> a<00:02:36.239> little<00:02:36.450> bit<00:02:36.629> of<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.840> mass<00:02:37.109> I

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
that I'd give a little bit of a mass I

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.500 
that I'd give a little bit of a mass I
give<00:02:37.469> a<00:02:37.500> little<00:02:37.739> bit<00:02:37.889> of<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.069> weight<00:02:38.310> to<00:02:38.969> the

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
give a little bit of a weight to the

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.360 
give a little bit of a weight to the
back<00:02:39.659> end<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:40.049> the<00:02:40.139> boring<00:02:40.379> bar<00:02:40.560> all<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.280> the

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:41.370 
back end of the boring bar all of the

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.489 
back end of the boring bar all of the
forces<00:02:41.730> are<00:02:42.090> at<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.450> tip<00:02:42.749> pulling<00:02:43.169> it<00:02:43.290> down

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:43.499 
forces are at the tip pulling it down

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:49.520 
forces are at the tip pulling it down
I'm<00:02:43.799> gonna<00:02:43.980> hold<00:02:44.219> the<00:02:44.459> back<00:02:44.609> end<00:02:45.049> stable<00:02:48.049> I<00:02:49.049> can

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
I'm gonna hold the back end stable I can

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:55.670 
I'm gonna hold the back end stable I can
get<00:02:49.680> more<00:02:49.889> aggressive<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:52.459> can<00:02:54.349> start<00:02:55.349> pushing

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
get more aggressive I can start pushing

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.409 
get more aggressive I can start pushing
harder<00:02:56.219> if<00:02:56.310> I<00:02:56.430> want<00:02:56.609> to<00:02:56.669> go<00:02:56.760> faster<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.209> faster

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
harder if I want to go faster and faster

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:01.099 
harder if I want to go faster and faster
because<00:02:58.019> I've<00:02:58.290> dampen<00:02:58.919> the<00:03:00.049> vibration<00:03:01.049> a

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:01.109 
because I've dampen the vibration a

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.319 
because I've dampen the vibration a
little<00:03:01.319> bit<00:03:01.439> with<00:03:01.590> my<00:03:01.799> hands<00:03:02.219> now<00:03:02.760> when<00:03:02.969> I<00:03:03.000> come

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
little bit with my hands now when I come

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:06.349 
little bit with my hands now when I come
to<00:03:03.859> undercutting<00:03:04.859> the<00:03:05.040> shoulder<00:03:05.430> and<00:03:05.669> working

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:06.359 
to undercutting the shoulder and working

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.659 
to undercutting the shoulder and working
in<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.689> more<00:03:07.349> bulbous<00:03:07.709> areas<00:03:08.099> I<00:03:08.250> swing<00:03:08.549> the

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
in the more bulbous areas I swing the

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:12.369 
in the more bulbous areas I swing the
handle<00:03:09.030> way<00:03:09.180> away<00:03:09.359> from<00:03:09.510> me<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.049> now<00:03:10.939> what's

00:03:12.369 --> 00:03:12.379 
handle way away from me and now what's

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.110 
handle way away from me and now what's
the<00:03:13.379> efficient<00:03:13.829> cut<00:03:14.099> is<00:03:14.280> going<00:03:14.430> to<00:03:14.519> be<00:03:14.669> to<00:03:14.969> be

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
the efficient cut is going to be to be

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.050 
the efficient cut is going to be to be
pulling<00:03:15.389> it<00:03:15.599> towards<00:03:15.900> my<00:03:16.019> tummy<00:03:16.230> okay<00:03:17.099> when<00:03:18.030> I

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
pulling it towards my tummy okay when I

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.610 
pulling it towards my tummy okay when I
was<00:03:18.299> down<00:03:18.479> in<00:03:18.659> the<00:03:18.689> bottom<00:03:19.109> of<00:03:19.229> it<00:03:19.379> I<00:03:19.500> was

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
was down in the bottom of it I was

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.039 
was down in the bottom of it I was
pulling<00:03:19.949> it<00:03:20.040> right<00:03:20.239> 90<00:03:21.239> degrees<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.720> the<00:03:21.840> lathe

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
pulling it right 90 degrees to the lathe

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.119 
pulling it right 90 degrees to the lathe
I<00:03:22.199> was<00:03:22.319> pulling<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:23.569> left<00:03:24.829> pulling<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:25.919> boring

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
I was pulling it left pulling the boring

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.979 
I was pulling it left pulling the boring
bar<00:03:26.310> left<00:03:26.489> well<00:03:27.000> now<00:03:27.209> when<00:03:27.419> i<00:03:27.449> swivel<00:03:27.810> the

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
bar left well now when i swivel the

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.629 
bar left well now when i swivel the
handle<00:03:28.349> around<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.949> to<00:03:29.280> undercut<00:03:29.609> the

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
handle around to to undercut the

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.360 
handle around to to undercut the
shoulder<00:03:30.060> what's<00:03:30.329> left<00:03:30.659> now<00:03:30.959> left<00:03:31.319> is<00:03:32.009> towards

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
shoulder what's left now left is towards

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.110 
shoulder what's left now left is towards
me<00:03:32.639> so<00:03:33.479> I'm<00:03:33.689> gonna<00:03:33.840> come<00:03:34.079> in<00:03:34.109> and<00:03:34.970> start<00:03:35.970> to

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
me so I'm gonna come in and start to

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.009 
me so I'm gonna come in and start to
make<00:03:36.239> little<00:03:36.479> notches<00:03:37.639> to<00:03:38.639> the<00:03:38.790> left<00:03:39.030> to<00:03:39.989> the

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
make little notches to the left to the

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.610 
make little notches to the left to the
left<00:03:40.189> to<00:03:41.189> the<00:03:41.310> left<00:03:41.549> to<00:03:41.909> the<00:03:42.479> left<00:03:42.750> to<00:03:43.139> the<00:03:43.769> left

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
so it's to the left of the cutter not

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.719 
so it's to the left of the cutter not
the<00:03:49.290> left<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.650> the<00:03:49.739> boring<00:03:50.009> bar<00:03:50.189> or<00:03:50.370> left<00:03:50.609> to

the lathe that's going to give you the
small<00:03:53.159> incremental<00:03:53.790> cuts<00:03:54.060> and<00:03:54.569> after<00:03:55.319> you've

00:03:55.429 --> 00:03:55.439 
small incremental cuts and after you've

small incremental cuts and after you've
been<00:03:55.620> doing<00:03:55.889> this<00:03:56.009> for<00:03:56.250> a<00:03:56.280> while<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:57.239> can

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:57.509 
been doing this for a while you can

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:59.990 
been doing this for a while you can
really<00:03:58.109> start<00:03:58.379> to<00:03:58.469> make<00:03:59.040> those<00:03:59.280> cuts<00:03:59.519> quickly

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
really start to make those cuts quickly

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.749 
really start to make those cuts quickly
and<00:04:00.419> efficiently<00:04:00.810> I<00:04:01.290> don't<00:04:02.009> use<00:04:02.219> the<00:04:02.430> tear

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:02.759 
and efficiently I don't use the tear

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:05.869 
and efficiently I don't use the tear
drop<00:04:03.030> kind<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.169> a<00:04:04.319> of<00:04:04.889> a<00:04:05.069> cutter<00:04:05.340> because<00:04:05.579> it

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
drop kind of a of a cutter because it

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.179 
drop kind of a of a cutter because it
takes<00:04:06.090> too<00:04:06.329> big<00:04:06.509> of<00:04:06.629> a<00:04:06.719> cut<00:04:06.959> in<00:04:07.229> fact<00:04:07.829> I've<00:04:07.979> used

00:04:08.179 --> 00:04:08.189 
takes too big of a cut in fact I've used

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:09.770 
takes too big of a cut in fact I've used
all<00:04:08.370> the<00:04:08.519> different<00:04:08.790> size<00:04:08.969> cutters<00:04:09.479> the

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
all the different size cutters the

quarter inch three three-eighths half
inch<00:04:12.299> whatever<00:04:12.719> and<00:04:12.989> they<00:04:13.620> they<00:04:13.919> all<00:04:14.129> get<00:04:14.400> a

00:04:15.039 --> 00:04:15.049 
inch whatever and they they all get a

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.569 
inch whatever and they they all get a
vibration<00:04:16.049> issues<00:04:16.500> because<00:04:17.099> they're<00:04:17.250> too<00:04:17.400> big

00:04:17.569 --> 00:04:17.579 
vibration issues because they're too big

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:20.330 
vibration issues because they're too big
and<00:04:17.789> I<00:04:17.849> always<00:04:18.000> go<00:04:18.209> back<00:04:18.389> to<00:04:18.449> the<00:04:18.859> 3/16<00:04:19.859> small

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
and I always go back to the 3/16 small

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.370 
and I always go back to the 3/16 small
cutter<00:04:20.669> and<00:04:20.940> even<00:04:21.599> in<00:04:21.719> the<00:04:21.810> carbide<00:04:22.169> cutter

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
cutter and even in the carbide cutter

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.379 
cutter and even in the carbide cutter
I'm<00:04:22.529> using<00:04:22.710> a<00:04:22.949> very<00:04:23.159> small<00:04:23.460> number<00:04:23.669> 100

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:24.389 
I'm using a very small number 100

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.070 
I'm using a very small number 100
carbide<00:04:24.810> because<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:25.830> its<00:04:25.979> efficiency

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.080 
carbide because of its efficiency

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.360 
carbide because of its efficiency
and<00:04:27.139> is<00:04:27.259> taking<00:04:27.590> the<00:04:27.680> right<00:04:27.889> amount<00:04:28.189> of<00:04:28.280> wood

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
and is taking the right amount of wood

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.369 
and is taking the right amount of wood
away<00:04:28.610> and<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.180> could<00:04:29.360> still<00:04:29.599> do<00:04:29.750> it<00:04:29.780> really<00:04:30.110> fast

00:04:30.369 --> 00:04:30.379 
away and I could still do it really fast

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:32.649 
away and I could still do it really fast
but<00:04:30.979> it's<00:04:31.189> not<00:04:31.370> taxing<00:04:31.909> anything<00:04:32.240> I<00:04:32.330> can<00:04:32.509> go

00:04:32.649 --> 00:04:32.659 
but it's not taxing anything I can go

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:34.869 
but it's not taxing anything I can go
deeper<00:04:33.050> I<00:04:33.080> can<00:04:33.319> go<00:04:33.439> easier<00:04:33.800> and<00:04:34.610> there<00:04:34.759> are

00:04:34.869 --> 00:04:34.879 
deeper I can go easier and there are

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.279 
deeper I can go easier and there are
times<00:04:35.120> when<00:04:35.419> I'm<00:04:35.509> working<00:04:35.539> on<00:04:35.900> this<00:04:36.050> side<00:04:36.259> of

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
this side of the lathe and then when I

this side of the lathe and then when I
go<00:04:59.389> to<00:04:59.449> measure<00:04:59.750> and<00:05:00.110> put<00:05:00.259> the<00:05:00.349> laser<00:05:00.560> on<00:05:00.710> I

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
the lathe and then I'm just going to use

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.860 
the lathe and then I'm just going to use
my<00:05:03.740> fingertips<00:05:04.430> to<00:05:05.150> watch<00:05:05.479> the<00:05:05.690> laser

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
my fingertips to watch the laser

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:10.930 
my fingertips to watch the laser
disappear<00:05:06.469> so<00:05:08.229> work<00:05:09.229> efficiently<00:05:09.909> you<00:05:10.909> can

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
disappear so work efficiently you can

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:13.749 
disappear so work efficiently you can
still<00:05:11.330> work<00:05:11.479> fast<00:05:11.930> and<00:05:12.229> aggressively<00:05:12.860> but<00:05:13.520> you

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
still work fast and aggressively but you

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:15.100 
still work fast and aggressively but you
don't<00:05:13.969> want<00:05:14.150> to<00:05:14.240> cause<00:05:14.419> vibration<00:05:14.990> vibration

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
don't want to cause vibration vibration

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.789 
don't want to cause vibration vibration
is<00:05:15.620> the<00:05:15.710> enemy<00:05:16.009> we<00:05:16.129> don't<00:05:16.310> want<00:05:16.430> to<00:05:16.490> go<00:05:16.580> there
