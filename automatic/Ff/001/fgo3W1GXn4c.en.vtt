00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 and are already circulating around the capital 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:08.040
 buses equipped with devices that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:10.580
 facilitating traffic control and 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.889
 boarding and disembarkation of passengers 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.619
 smart buses are in the process of 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:19.800
 and one of the main innovations is the 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:23.039
 beep Princess Isabel terminal 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.350
 In the central region, the 20 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.420
 buses of the fleet 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.300
 paulistana a trip computer 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.669
 control vehicle performance 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.280
 mechanical problems that the path 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.860
 the data is sent to a 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.649
 after the trip the system generates 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.440
 a whole database and statistics 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.270
 to identify as kiss as the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.010
 transport system is operating if 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.059
 He's very efficient if he's needing it. 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.829
 improve 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.840
 and there both the transport operator 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.449
 how much manager organ can be planned 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.230
 best to provide better mobility for 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.480
 the population 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.760
 the appliance is part of a series of 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.280
 smart devices that are 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.270
 being tested on five bus lines 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.390
 the capital has 509 m connecting the terminal 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.210
 miriam garden in the south is the best 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.580
 equipped has electronic panels with 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.460
 information about the stops and also 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.670
 beeps for both those in 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.670
 Score 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.509
 Isabel 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.100
 as for who is following the trip 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.240
 I think it's great sometimes we 're so 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.509
 distracted and passed the point is otherwise 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:43.000
 people get slow and 10/5 certain more 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:46.210
 I also welcome the 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.850
 majority does not ask more friend announcement 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.710
 time to here then the electronic panel 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.179
 also appears all stops 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.640
 the staff if they turn around by themselves 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:02:00.369
 alone the system was thought too 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:02.920
 to assist the visually impaired is 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.990
 very good makes life so much easier 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.940
 of users, right? 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.519
 the director of financial management of 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:12.400
 sptrans says that security is also a 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:14.530
 targets of the implementations is being 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.019
 also placed a camera with 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:21.040
 technology for text recognition 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:23.380
 which is aimed at is in the event of 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.150
 there is invasion of dark vehicle corridor 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.190
 not authorized it will do the 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.349
 recognition of the board and will be 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.720
 issued a fine although this is a 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.239
 thing that still stands for some of a 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.000
 of the final authorizations of the 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.950
 transit and with security cameras and 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.190
 sound warnings that prevent 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:44.700
 passengers to miss the stopping point until 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.040
 country getting distracted on the way or 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:50.290
 working studying online 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.130
 better still if the right for free 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.100
 French 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:58.090
 Are you accessing there on Facebook? 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:00.340
 and then not see the time of the trip and spending 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.470
 There are even those who take the opportunity to 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.590
 service during the trip 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.030
 working because he found the signal at 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:09.910
 sometimes even better than my carrier 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:13.120
 Another novelty is this sensor 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:15.069
 Doors that counts passengers 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.170
 This is very important because you have a 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.989
 year is too full it does not support 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.450
 more shipments and he could make a 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.200
 for example from a point 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:25.720
 until the end 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.420
 devices are in the test phase 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.819
 and the estimate is that until November 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:35.489
 definitively integrate the fleet of 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.489
 capital with about 15 thousand buses 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.310
 love
