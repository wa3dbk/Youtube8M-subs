00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.270
 hi friends from youtube i am masai and today 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.480
 I bring you this tutorial so 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.420
 next, because what happens is that 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.910
 now trying windows 8 installing it and 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.590
 testing several versions it turns out that 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.470
 can enter the partitions of 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:22.030
 windows 8 from any distribution 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:24.550
 of linux whether this ubuntu of forgiveness of 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:28.240
 genus linux and action together of well of 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:30.720
 Any chips as good what 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.339
 happens is the following I 'm going to show you 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:37.569
 these two partitions that are 

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:41.920
 here that is the 322 gigas and the 73 

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:44.409
 gigabytes where they are in the tfsi the 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.829
 use windows 8 and let's open 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:51.309
 anyone is if they see me tell me not to 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.929
 can because bla bla good this that 

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:55.749
 turn off simply because we're going to see 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:58.709
 a problem that lies somewhere 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:01.420
 wintering mode we give in accept 

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:04.440
 we open the other one that is windows and 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.630
 I can not enter either 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.550
 I explain more or less what it is that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.490
 happens then what happens is that windows 8 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.200
 it's not as fast as you think and a lot 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.540
 people have said some 8 is much more 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.700
 fast that windows 7 lies so good 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.440
 what is it that happens then this windows 8 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.750
 is found when the time that best 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:25.560
 we turn off there is an option that what 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:28.680
 ago is and it starts like wintering winter 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.690
 or suspend the computer does not shut down by 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 complete if you do not save some things for 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.740
 that start much faster so that it 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.450
 turn off faster then that's the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.670
 problem why we can not enter the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.130
 partitions prove this for example in 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.050
 windows 7 put to winter your 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.360
 computer or suspend it let it 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.640
 turn off completely turn on the and on 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.400
 place to enter with windows 7 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.660
 I enter with 1 point and they will check that 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.690
 they can not enter the partitions 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:57.270
 because it is wintering or suspended by 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.580
 example if then that is the problem 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.950
 to solve it, let's go to windows a 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.229
 windows 8 to make the solution of this 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.520
 problem let's do it now let's go 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.160
 for 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.690
 Well, I'm already on Windows 8 now 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.000
 the only thing we have to do is what 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.980
 next even if it does not look like windows 8 me 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.650
 I'm going to put it as windows 8 for 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.560
 that they see that if it is windows 8 good now 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.269
 what we have to do is look for this 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.190
 to be able to search around here it appears 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.900
 a lupita or if we do not put any 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.420
 command we have to put it any 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.580
 any key to see what 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.370
 we are looking for example to get in 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.799
 but we have to get md to 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:37.530
 that this appears to us is the symbol of 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.840
 system or cmd as before was used in 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.180
 ms-two so good what we have to 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.680
 to do is to open it but this I know 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:46.380
 I leave in the description of the video itself 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.510
 they do not know how to put a c a m nothing 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.299
 good because anything that does not have 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.640
 no problem and instead of giving it a 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:56.489
 click with the mouse to open it denle 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.560
 right click without right 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.900
 we look here below where it says run 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.220
 as an administrator and there we give you a 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.310
 click and then ask us if 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.040
 we want to open it we put that yes 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.250
 we vote we put it to yes and since 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.410
 we have here the symbol of the system that 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.670
 is this what we have to do is 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.670
 put the following command 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.510
 and we have a space 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.020
 and with this we remove that little problem that 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.820
 We had this command, I'll leave it to you 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.000
 the description of the video here below the 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.830
 video is going to show us this command 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.110
 I'm going to leave the distribution for the 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:41.730
 blog in the description they go to the blog and 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:44.640
 of iu they copy it and they stick it they can 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.700
 copy and paste in the cmd yes well 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.680
 let's try if true 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.020
 we go to ubuntu to test if we can 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.430
 enter if I also leave the command 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:55.530
 so you can go back to 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.960
 activate if they want it because they are going 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.540
 to see that windows 8 is going to turn on more 

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.600
 slow and shut down slower because because 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.850
 we take off the crazy half winter 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.850
 what's so good and we're going to do 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.370
 Well , I already returned here to August 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.670
 the best that could be that it took me a little 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.370
 for the schedule that I have here the 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:20.320
 problem was that I took the audio 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.990
 I have a problem I had a problem and 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.250
 when the audio men took a bit 

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.020
 configuring it but good and what 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.880
 promised is debt and here I am 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.730
 Well what we 're going to do is try 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.270
 it's true what I did that they're going to say 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.240
 that is witchcraft is not creating because 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:39.160
 came into this one I can already enter 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.169
 I can enter the other one that I have all 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.490
 my files and this is where I have 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:49.800
 windows yes well that's actually 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:53.260
 everything I wanted to show you this 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:55.210
 since this is not really what 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.669
 better they will not say it's a great tutorial but 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:00.130
 If something can help them well 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:04.200
 subscribe comment the video liked 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.200
 they did not like anything there we are
