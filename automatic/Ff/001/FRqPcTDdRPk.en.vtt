George<00:03:40.200> just<00:03:40.410> just<00:03:40.770> just<00:03:41.570> demonstrated<00:03:42.570> it

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
George just just just demonstrated it

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.330 
George just just just demonstrated it
with<00:03:42.840> very<00:03:43.230> little<00:03:43.620> weight<00:03:43.770> on<00:03:43.920> the<00:03:44.040> left<00:03:44.220> foot

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
with very little weight on the left foot

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.400 
with very little weight on the left foot
but<00:03:44.640> for<00:03:44.910> balance<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:45.600> could<00:03:45.900> put<00:03:46.170> a<00:03:46.200> little

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
but for balance you could put a little

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.810 
but for balance you could put a little
bit<00:03:46.530> more<00:03:46.860> weight<00:03:47.040> if<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.370> feel<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:47.790> need

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
bit more weight if you feel you need

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.280 
bit more weight if you feel you need
that<00:03:48.180> maybe<00:03:48.480> show<00:03:48.720> them<00:03:48.750> with<00:03:49.020> just<00:03:49.170> a<00:03:49.260> little

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
that maybe show them with just a little

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.860 
that maybe show them with just a little
more<00:03:49.620> weight<00:03:49.830> okay<00:03:50.280> on<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.820> left<00:03:50.850> foot<00:03:51.180> when

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
more weight okay on the left foot when

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.120 
more weight okay on the left foot when
we<00:03:52.050> do<00:03:52.170> it<00:03:52.260> together<00:03:52.380> so<00:03:54.680> George's<00:03:55.680> left<00:03:55.920> foot

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
we do it together so George's left foot

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:57.560 
we do it together so George's left foot
could<00:03:56.370> take<00:03:56.580> just<00:03:56.760> a<00:03:56.970> little<00:03:57.090> bit<00:03:57.240> more<00:03:57.480> of

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.570 
could take just a little bit more of

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.840 
could take just a little bit more of
that<00:03:57.600> weight<00:03:57.990> if<00:03:58.800> it's<00:03:59.070> easier<00:03:59.459> on<00:03:59.520> your

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
that weight if it's easier on your

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:06.010 
that weight if it's easier on your
balance<00:04:03.470> it's<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.530> very<00:04:04.800> nice<00:04:05.010> way<00:04:05.250> of<00:04:05.400> turning

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
balance it's a very nice way of turning

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.360 
balance it's a very nice way of turning
