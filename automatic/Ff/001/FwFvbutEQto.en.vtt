 and the articulation of the power of medicine one of the doctors 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.540

 cuartelaria painting that I as a tactical ally do not consent parsley 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.910

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.680
 the announcement was made to wait 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.170
 the word is articulated dramatically but they are ideologically constructed 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.530

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.060

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.680
 critic style 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.290
 what we do to the other that is our

 umberto eco says ethics begins when others enter the scene 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.960
 in doses the ethic that says what is 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.040
 treat the patient how not only would he be alone 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:44.920
 the fundamentals 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.660
 to recommend to doctors in training 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.080

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.310
 the second book that silvia martín fierro would recommend 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.950

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.930
 the people of power 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.970

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.080
 yes the bible 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.800
 I found the health concept 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.989
 actually that moderation 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.769
 AIDS 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:12.560
 Health 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.560
 is to govern with justice 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:17.859
 as it comes added 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:20.299
 after 40 years the municipal room 

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:21.909

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.520
 that there is no human being totally bad 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.309
 as well as in totally human being ue 

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:30.439
 and that every human being always recover the path to follow 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:33.140
 there is always someone who has 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.409
 video of the beaches 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:37.699
 but also always someone who comes back picks it up 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.699
 for a long time nor to death is an anthropological approach 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.899
 death music for social control 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.029
 in Mexico the cemeteries 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:50.269
 fast are not vertical they are horizontal 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.009
 it's a coming tradition 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:53.949
 the one of the Aztecs 

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:55.239
 Day of the Death 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.499
 with a tablecloth 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:59.549

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:18.999
 new and difficult 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:19.900
 that sense 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.419
 the transcendence 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:24.509
 homo sapiens is broad because its dead surroundings 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.289
 na and its predecessor and nobody does it out of direct 

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.629
 as transcendence something with death as the 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.669
 and experts in services ovi maps and three of secondary

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.319
 the memorable rite of passage ss nazis 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.869

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:00.709
 after introducing the culture 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.079
 the priest joseph has to do 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:05.140

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:10.649
 the other 89 5% 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:15.379
 that's what they are by type of store possible 19 with Christmas if something 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.519
 make 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:17.959
 so that after dead 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.759
 keep talking with a friend instead of that night 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.879
 if death ends all desolate service 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:26.900
 take existential 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.349
 but I continue despite the fact that death transcendence 

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:33.349
 life death 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.360

00:05:04.309 --> 00:05:06.279
 not just the doctor's office 

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:09.629
 the hospital to average pgr but but if the bioethics committee

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:21.509
 of course to achieve it you always have to leave something 

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:23.279
 nobody climbs the ladder with 

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:26.150
 from above you always have to travel 

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.699
 the only thing that left it 

00:05:27.699 --> 00:05:29.099
 because it's worth what you want
