00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
walking around with it just get screwed

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.780 
walking around with it just get screwed
up<00:03:17.230> that's<00:03:17.470> why<00:03:17.590> it's<00:03:17.709> good<00:03:17.830> up<00:03:17.950> you<00:03:18.489> know<00:03:18.610> put

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
up that's why it's good up you know put

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.000 
up that's why it's good up you know put

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:31.299 
see if the I lock is there one trick

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.330 
see if the I lock is there one trick
people<00:03:31.480> used<00:03:31.810> to<00:03:31.930> do<00:03:32.110> they<00:03:32.709> used<00:03:32.890> to<00:03:32.980> plug<00:03:33.220> the

Rhine lock in launch Pro Tools take the

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.620 
Rhine lock in launch Pro Tools take the
high<00:03:35.769> lock<00:03:36.010> out

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:37.630

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:40.170 
high lock out
and<00:03:38.010> supposedly<00:03:39.010> now<00:03:39.580> if<00:03:39.790> you<00:03:39.880> do<00:03:40.030> that

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
and supposedly now if you do that

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.240 
and supposedly now if you do that
ProTools<00:03:40.810> will<00:03:41.020> know<00:03:41.170> so<00:03:41.650> you<00:03:41.710> can<00:03:41.920> no<00:03:42.010> longer

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
ProTools will know so you can no longer

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.330 
ProTools will know so you can no longer
have<00:03:42.840> one<00:03:43.840> eye<00:03:43.870> lock<00:03:44.290> and<00:03:44.590> three<00:03:44.920> computers

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
have one eye lock and three computers

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.670 
have one eye lock and three computers
will<00:03:45.460> produce<00:03:45.930> something<00:03:46.930> people<00:03:47.290> used<00:03:47.470> to<00:03:47.500> do

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
will produce something people used to do
