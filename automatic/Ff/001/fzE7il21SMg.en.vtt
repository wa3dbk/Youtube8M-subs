00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
we take it and we mag filled it mag seal

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.619 
we take it and we mag filled it mag seal
is<00:00:54.050> a<00:00:54.080> process<00:00:54.620> where<00:00:54.920> it's<00:00:55.550> magnetic<00:00:56.059> oil<00:00:56.330> in

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 
is a process where it's magnetic oil in

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.470 
is a process where it's magnetic oil in
inside<00:00:57.290> where<00:00:58.010> the<00:00:58.190> water<00:00:58.580> and<00:00:58.940> the<00:00:59.239> spool

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
inside where the water and the spool

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.329 
inside where the water and the spool
shaft<00:00:59.720> goes<00:00:59.900> up<00:01:00.050> and<00:01:00.199> down<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:00.800> I<00:01:00.830> mean<00:01:01.100> water

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:01.339 
shaft goes up and down so I mean water

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.520 
shaft goes up and down so I mean water
does<00:01:01.580> not<00:01:01.730> go<00:01:01.940> into<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.239> body<00:01:02.510> of<00:01:02.629> the<00:01:02.720> reel<00:01:03.019> it

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
does not go into the body of the reel it

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.290 
does not go into the body of the reel it
prevents<00:01:03.949> extra<00:01:04.460> any<00:01:04.699> kind<00:01:04.940> of<00:01:05.000> corrosion

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
prevents extra any kind of corrosion

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.149 
prevents extra any kind of corrosion
from<00:01:05.630> happening<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:06.230> could<00:01:06.620> actually<00:01:06.800> take

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
from happening you could actually take

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.950 
from happening you could actually take
this<00:01:07.310> real<00:01:07.550> Paul<00:01:08.120> and<00:01:08.300> dunk<00:01:08.510> it<00:01:08.630> underwater

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960 
this real Paul and dunk it underwater

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.080 
this real Paul and dunk it underwater
pull<00:01:09.710> it<00:01:09.830> from<00:01:10.010> under<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:10.250> water<00:01:10.430> and<00:01:10.729> you
