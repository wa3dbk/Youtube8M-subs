00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 today I am going to talk about something that surely 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.490
 you will not know it's about the piercing 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.340
 cerebral the most extreme piercing that 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:15.299
 has never existed basically what 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.300
 does the surgeon is pierce the layer of 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.660
 skull bone and put in there the 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.640
 piercing at the moment so that in 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.090
 the moment the piercing comes in 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.150
 it makes contact with the brain when 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.780
 the wound is closed the piercing remains 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.130
 in contact with the brain forever 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.290
 modifying the mood of the person who 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.120
 the piercing is done in fact to those 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.850
 people who have dared to become 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.059
 brain piercing describes in the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.300
 been as if it was a state of taking 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:51.030
 drugs not a state of euphoria are 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.129
 as as deranged 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.289
 it's a really a very piercing 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.059
 dangerous can cause serious damage in 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.010
 the brain tissue but there are people 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.050
 unconscious they come to pay large 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.809
 amounts of money as such 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.140
 pierce the skull to get a 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.149
 piercing and endangering your life the 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.430
 people who get this piercing at 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:13.440
 after a while they end up being addicted 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.659
 basically because they behave in a 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.360
 way very different from the one that 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.280
 they would behave if they did not have it 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.490
 that are in a constant state of 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.560
 euphoria are in a very different way 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.770
 they used to be and they get to be 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.750
 addicted to being that way according to 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.460
 surgeons as I said there is a 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.399
 serious risk of spills 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.970
 brain or that tissue damage 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.810
 brain irreparably with what 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.039
 which I would think twice before 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.960
 before doing this kind of 

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:48.899
 intervention simply because you can 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.440
 be that you do not survive a piercing in 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.440
 brain
