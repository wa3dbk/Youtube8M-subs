00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
hole just like so obviously we want that

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.749 
hole just like so obviously we want that
on<00:01:09.959> the<00:01:10.079> side<00:01:10.259> first<00:01:10.590> now<00:01:11.039> become<00:01:11.310> a<00:01:11.340> parent<00:01:11.670> in

00:01:11.749 --> 00:01:11.759 
on the side first now become a parent in

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:13.550 
on the side first now become a parent in
a<00:01:11.819> second<00:01:12.179> so<00:01:12.450> we<00:01:12.479> just<00:01:12.689> need<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.899> push<00:01:13.289> it<00:01:13.439> in

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
a second so we just need to push it in

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.620 
a second so we just need to push it in
the<00:01:13.709> hole<00:01:13.969> and<00:01:14.969> this<00:01:15.060> where<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.359> can<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.569> a

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
the hole and this where it can get a

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.090 
the hole and this where it can get a
little<00:01:15.869> bit<00:01:16.079> tricky<00:01:16.380> so<00:01:16.529> you<00:01:16.560> might<00:01:16.859> want<00:01:17.069> to

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
little bit tricky so you might want to

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.300 
little bit tricky so you might want to
minecart<00:01:17.609> them<00:01:17.819> up<00:01:17.999> and<00:01:18.209> get<00:01:19.049> them<00:01:19.229> in<00:01:19.529> and

minecart them up and get them in and

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.209 
minecart them up and get them in and
then<00:01:20.429> do<00:01:20.639> this<00:01:20.789> all<00:01:21.799> after<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.920> ring<00:01:23.039> of<00:01:23.159> the

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
then do this all after the ring of the

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:27.349 
then do this all after the ring of the
hole<00:01:23.429> just<00:01:24.109> play<00:01:25.109> ball<00:01:25.459> Pig<00:01:26.459> no<00:01:26.789> this<00:01:27.179> is<00:01:27.329> a

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:27.359 
hole just play ball Pig no this is a

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:32.109 
hole just play ball Pig no this is a
sheep<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.810> containment<00:01:28.350> for<00:01:28.619> now<00:01:30.200> once<00:01:31.200> these

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
sheep of containment for now once these

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:34.399 
sheep of containment for now once these
you<00:01:33.119> want<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.359> block<00:01:33.599> him<00:01:33.779> in<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:34.109> like<00:01:34.259> that

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
you want to block him in just like that

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.279 
you want to block him in just like that
and<00:01:34.679> then<00:01:34.999> push<00:01:35.999> him<00:01:36.179> over<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.539> little<00:01:36.599> bit<00:01:37.049> so

00:01:37.279 --> 00:01:37.289 
and then push him over a little bit so

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:39.440 
and then push him over a little bit so
that<00:01:38.069> you<00:01:38.249> can<00:01:38.399> put<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> carpet<00:01:38.999> down<00:01:39.029> just<00:01:39.359> like

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
that you can put a carpet down just like

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.620 
that you can put a carpet down just like
that

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
that

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.169 
that
so<00:01:40.469> now<00:01:40.649> you've<00:01:41.159> actually<00:01:41.310> trapped<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.060> you

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
so now you've actually trapped it you

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.889 
so now you've actually trapped it you
can<00:01:42.329> leave<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.599> like<00:01:42.719> that

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
can leave it like that

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:44.599 
can leave it like that
maybe<00:01:43.170> if<00:01:43.499> you<00:01:43.679> wanted<00:01:43.919> it<00:01:44.159> kind<00:01:44.310> of<00:01:44.429> looks<00:01:44.579> a

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:53.239 
what you do is go on top of the glass
block<00:01:49.399> too-tall<00:01:50.659> break<00:01:51.659> this<00:01:51.810> one<00:01:52.130> come<00:01:53.130> up

00:01:53.239 --> 00:01:53.249 
block too-tall break this one come up

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:54.709 
block too-tall break this one come up
underneath<00:01:53.549> it<00:01:53.819> so<00:01:53.909> we<00:01:53.999> get<00:01:54.119> downward<00:01:54.539> facing

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:54.719 
underneath it so we get downward facing

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.519 
underneath it so we get downward facing
piston<00:01:55.289> and<00:01:55.849> then<00:01:57.079> we<00:01:58.079> would<00:01:58.200> just<00:01:58.289> want<00:01:58.380> to

00:01:58.519 --> 00:01:58.529 
piston and then we would just want to

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:59.989 
piston and then we would just want to
basically<00:01:58.709> activate<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.429> so<00:01:59.609> that<00:01:59.789> it<00:01:59.880> goes

00:01:59.989 --> 00:01:59.999 
basically activate it so that it goes

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:01.300 
basically activate it so that it goes
down

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
down

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.020 
down
and<00:02:02.619> gotta<00:02:03.619> be<00:02:03.740> quick<00:02:04.039> here<00:02:04.249> because<00:02:04.670> when<00:02:04.999> you

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.030 
and gotta be quick here because when you

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.779 
and gotta be quick here because when you
release<00:02:05.479> it<00:02:05.749> it's<00:02:06.109> able<00:02:06.469> to<00:02:06.590> jump<00:02:06.979> so<00:02:07.609> what<00:02:07.729> you

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
release it it's able to jump so what you

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.910 
release it it's able to jump so what you
want<00:02:07.909> to<00:02:07.939> do<00:02:08.119> is<00:02:08.360> you<00:02:08.450> want<00:02:08.569> to<00:02:08.599> quickly<00:02:08.920> on

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
want to do is you want to quickly on

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.280 
want to do is you want to quickly on
activate<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.640> place<00:02:10.940> a<00:02:10.970> block<00:02:11.330> where<00:02:12.049> this

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
activate and place a block where this

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.960 
activate and place a block where this
extended<00:02:12.920> piston<00:02:13.220> head<00:02:13.340> is<00:02:13.459> right<00:02:13.640> now<00:02:13.760> so<00:02:13.910> you

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
extended piston head is right now so you

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.820 
extended piston head is right now so you
wanna<00:02:14.209> quickly<00:02:14.360> do<00:02:14.569> that<00:02:14.599> so<00:02:15.200> that<00:02:15.349> it<00:02:15.470> can't

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
wanna quickly do that so that it can't

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.009 
wanna quickly do that so that it can't
jump<00:02:16.220> out<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.670> container<00:02:17.060> so<00:02:17.269> and<00:02:17.569> now

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
jump out of the container so and now

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:23.080 
jump out of the container so and now
you've<00:02:18.920> got<00:02:19.069> yourself<00:02:19.370> a<00:02:19.640> a<00:02:20.950> sheep<00:02:22.090> decoration

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
you've got yourself a a sheep decoration

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.729 
you've got yourself a a sheep decoration
although<00:02:23.390> you<00:02:23.840> can<00:02:23.989> use<00:02:24.110> it<00:02:24.230> with<00:02:24.319> any<00:02:24.530> mob

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
although you can use it with any mob

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:26.830 
although you can use it with any mob
like<00:02:24.920> I<00:02:24.950> said<00:02:25.220> like<00:02:25.370> skeleton<00:02:25.940> zombies<00:02:26.330> just

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
like I said like skeleton zombies just

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.000 
like I said like skeleton zombies just
make<00:02:27.019> sure<00:02:27.170> if<00:02:27.290> it<00:02:27.410> is<00:02:27.440> a<00:02:27.500> skeleton<00:02:27.890> or<00:02:27.920> a

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
make sure if it is a skeleton or a

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.680 
make sure if it is a skeleton or a
zombie<00:02:28.160> you've<00:02:28.489> got<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.640> block<00:02:28.910> that<00:02:29.360> so<00:02:29.540> that

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
zombie you've got a block that so that

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.170 
zombie you've got a block that so that
they<00:02:29.780> don't<00:02:29.900> burn<00:02:30.440> into<00:02:30.739> the<00:02:30.799> daylight<00:02:31.519> if

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
they don't burn into the daylight if

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.339 
they don't burn into the daylight if
it's<00:02:32.360> outdoors<00:02:32.780> like<00:02:33.080> this<00:02:33.819> but<00:02:34.819> it<00:02:34.940> is<00:02:35.349> kind

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
it's outdoors like this but it is kind

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:37.930 
it's outdoors like this but it is kind
of<00:02:36.470> easy<00:02:36.620> actually<00:02:36.890> compared<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.670> what<00:02:37.849> are

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
of easy actually compared to what are

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:40.089 
of easy actually compared to what are
for<00:02:38.150> it<00:02:38.269> would<00:02:38.390> be<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:39.650> might<00:02:39.829> want<00:02:40.040> to

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
for it would be so you might want to

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:41.860 
for it would be so you might want to
minecart<00:02:40.610> up<00:02:40.700> all<00:02:40.910> of<00:02:41.060> these<00:02:41.120> first

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
minecart up all of these first

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.210 
minecart up all of these first
and<00:02:41.989> then<00:02:42.140> push<00:02:42.440> them<00:02:42.620> in<00:02:42.769> and<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:42.920> break<00:02:43.099> the

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
and then push them in and and break the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.190 
and then push them in and and break the
minecart<00:02:43.610> and<00:02:43.790> do<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.120> way<00:02:44.239> or<00:02:44.450> leave

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
minecart and do it that way or leave

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.789 
minecart and do it that way or leave
them<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.530> however<00:02:45.739> you<00:02:45.980> want<00:02:46.099> to<00:02:46.160> do<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:47.799> a

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:48.799 
them in however you want to do it and a

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:50.800 
them in however you want to do it and a
little<00:02:49.250> bonus<00:02:49.640> extra<00:02:50.150> trick<00:02:50.329> is<00:02:50.480> you<00:02:50.690> can

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
little bonus extra trick is you can

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.080 
little bonus extra trick is you can
obviously<00:02:51.079> push<00:02:51.500> this<00:02:51.709> down<00:02:52.190> into<00:02:52.760> the<00:02:52.879> floor

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
obviously push this down into the floor

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.729 
obviously push this down into the floor
one<00:02:53.359> more<00:02:53.599> so<00:02:53.810> that<00:02:53.959> this<00:02:54.049> top<00:02:54.470> layer<00:02:54.709> of

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
one more so that this top layer of

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.420 
one more so that this top layer of
carpet<00:02:55.340> is<00:02:55.879> actually<00:02:56.299> on<00:02:56.540> top<00:02:56.959> like<00:02:57.379> this<00:02:57.890> so

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
carpet is actually on top like this so

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.250 
carpet is actually on top like this so
it<00:02:59.150> would<00:02:59.269> look<00:02:59.450> like<00:02:59.510> that<00:02:59.810> and<00:02:59.989> the<00:03:00.079> mob

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
it would look like that and the mob

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.099 
it would look like that and the mob
would<00:03:00.440> be<00:03:00.530> in<00:03:00.680> there<00:03:00.859> so<00:03:01.129> it'd<00:03:01.700> be<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:02.299> level

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
would be in there so it'd be a level

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.440 
would be in there so it'd be a level
just<00:03:03.620> like<00:03:03.829> that<00:03:03.980> so<00:03:04.250> there's<00:03:05.090> just<00:03:05.239> another

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
just like that so there's just another

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.289 
just like that so there's just another
added<00:03:05.810> bonus<00:03:06.230> feature<00:03:06.709> but<00:03:07.639> I<00:03:07.670> really<00:03:08.209> hope

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:08.299 
added bonus feature but I really hope

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:10.240 
added bonus feature but I really hope
you<00:03:08.510> enjoyed<00:03:08.540> they<00:03:09.109> can<00:03:09.319> never<00:03:09.560> jump<00:03:09.920> out<00:03:10.069> they
