like this it will help to inject them

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.460 
like this it will help to inject them
and<00:00:13.639> rehydrate<00:00:14.639> them<00:00:14.879> and<00:00:15.150> if<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.080> have<00:00:16.260> not

and rehydrate them and if you have not

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.060 
and rehydrate them and if you have not
seen<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.369> injection<00:00:18.360> process<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:19.650> can<00:00:19.859> see

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070

that on my hints and tips this has been

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.679 
that on my hints and tips this has been
rehydrating<00:00:25.230> overnight<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.240> what<00:00:27.240> I'm<00:00:27.390> going

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
rehydrating overnight and what I'm going

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.230 
rehydrating overnight and what I'm going
to<00:00:27.779> do<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:29.330> pinch<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.570> under<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:32.310> wings<00:00:32.640> on<00:00:33.060> the

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:33.240 
to do is pinch it under the wings on the

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.010 
to do is pinch it under the wings on the
thorax<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.760> make<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.969> wings<00:00:36.210> open<00:00:36.780> up<00:00:37.200> I

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
thorax and make the wings open up I

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:47.510 
thorax and make the wings open up I
gently<00:00:40.020> go<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.620> there<00:00:42.320> using<00:00:43.320> forceps<00:00:44.719> and<00:00:46.520> I

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
gently go in there using forceps and I

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.270 
gently go in there using forceps and I
wiggle<00:00:48.000> I<00:00:48.120> wiggle<00:00:48.629> wiggle<00:00:48.809> wiggle<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.859> loosen

them<00:00:50.399> up<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:51.090> both<00:00:51.780> sides

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:56.629 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:59.930 

it<00:00:57.629> makes<00:00:58.050> positioning<00:00:59.039> their<00:00:59.219> wings<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.699> lot

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
it makes positioning their wings a lot

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.190 
it makes positioning their wings a lot
easier<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:01.280> also<00:01:02.280> try<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:03.110> maneuver<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.440> head

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
easier I also try to maneuver the head

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.039 
easier I also try to maneuver the head
before<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.500> get<00:01:07.830> him<00:01:08.040> down<00:01:08.310> on<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.700> board

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
before I get him down on the board

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.840 
before I get him down on the board
getting<00:01:10.049> him<00:01:10.259> to<00:01:10.500> look<00:01:10.710> as<00:01:11.340> straight<00:01:11.729> as

possible in this case I'm using a number
7<00:01:16.950> pin<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.520> will<00:01:18.150> be<00:01:18.530> trading<00:01:19.530> pins<00:01:19.890> out<00:01:20.189> when<00:01:20.490> I

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
7 pin I will be trading pins out when I

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.219 
7 pin I will be trading pins out when I
put<00:01:20.790> him<00:01:20.850> in<00:01:20.970> my<00:01:21.030> collection<00:01:21.750> box<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:24.020> want<00:01:25.020> to

put him in my collection box I want to

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.270 
put him in my collection box I want to
make<00:01:25.439> sure<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:25.740> go<00:01:26.130> down<00:01:26.400> straight<00:01:27.150> through<00:01:27.720> his

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
make sure I go down straight through his

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:39.620 
make sure I go down straight through his
thorax<00:01:31.759> putting<00:01:32.759> him<00:01:34.640> in<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:36.509> groove<00:01:38.630> nice

and<00:01:39.899> straight<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:42.770> push<00:01:43.770> her<00:01:44.009> down<00:01:45.200> so<00:01:46.200> her

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and straight I push her down so her

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.120 
and straight I push her down so her
wings<00:01:47.310> are<00:01:48.170> even<00:01:49.170> with<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.409> surface<00:01:49.799> of<00:01:50.009> the

wings are even with the surface of the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:59.469 
wings are even with the surface of the
board<00:01:55.009> I'm<00:01:56.009> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.399> be<00:01:56.549> using<00:01:57.500> strips<00:01:58.500> of

00:01:59.469 --> 00:01:59.479 
board I'm going to be using strips of

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:11.590 
board I'm going to be using strips of
cardstock<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:01.289> hold<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.560> wings<00:02:01.799> down

try to get this head to look straight by
using<00:05:29.060> your<00:05:29.360> pins<00:05:29.720> on<00:05:30.050> both<00:05:30.770> sides<00:05:32.890> holding<00:05:33.890> it

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.310 
shaped V a V angle with each of the
antennae<00:05:50.090> and<00:05:50.390> I'm<00:05:51.020> using<00:05:51.350> my<00:05:51.530> pins<00:05:52.840> in<00:05:53.840> a

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
antennae and I'm using my pins in a

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.210 
antennae and I'm using my pins in a
cross<00:05:54.970> pinning<00:05:56.320> technique<00:05:57.320> to<00:05:57.770> hold<00:05:58.010> them

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
cross pinning technique to hold them

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.890 
cross pinning technique to hold them
down<00:05:58.750> in<00:05:59.950> the<00:06:00.950> center<00:06:01.310> area<00:06:01.520> and<00:06:02.000> it<00:06:02.240> doesn't

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
down in the center area and it doesn't

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.590 
down in the center area and it doesn't
hurt<00:06:03.169> to<00:06:03.470> do<00:06:04.160> it<00:06:04.280> on<00:06:04.370> the<00:06:04.550> tips<00:06:04.880> because<00:06:05.419> as

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600 
hurt to do it on the tips because as

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:15.490 
hurt to do it on the tips because as
they<00:06:05.870> dry<00:06:06.290> the<00:06:06.350> tips<00:06:06.950> do<00:06:07.760> tend<00:06:08.150> to<00:06:08.330> curl<00:06:14.500> we're

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
they dry the tips do tend to curl we're

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.340 
they dry the tips do tend to curl we're
going<00:06:15.650> to<00:06:15.710> do<00:06:15.890> the<00:06:16.010> other<00:06:16.220> side<00:06:16.960> exactly<00:06:17.960> the

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:18.350 
going to do the other side exactly the

00:06:18.350 --> 00:06:33.420 
going to do the other side exactly the
same<00:06:18.620> way

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:33.430 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:38.810
