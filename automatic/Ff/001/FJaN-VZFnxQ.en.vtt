00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
 It is a recycling plant 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.110
 inert waste in particular from 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.490
 construction derivatives and good 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.219
 because one of the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.900
 responsible for this plant a company 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.420
 Besides, he's been trying for years 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.150
 implement this project we were 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.760
 telling what the difficulties are 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.710
 which has gone through the putting in 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.109
 march of this plant plus this plant is 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.550
 you have to understand not only as a 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.370
 need and also the good that it brings and 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:39.120
 It generated by the ten jobs 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.700
 who has managed to contract but because 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.890
 also allows a reuse of the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.450
 construction products and plant 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.260
 in itself is a project of 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.629
 restoration of the tafira landscape with 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.160
 which this was formerly a 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.220
 extraction 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.140
 illegal of aggregates and this plant has been 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.630
 placed here so that those 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.640
 products that do not have an outlet in the 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.650
 market fill in this 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.300
 extraction and after a few years then 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.610
 this recovery plan and 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.560
 restoration of the Tafira landscape 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:14.450
 stay integrated 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.360
 belongs to the construction sector 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.670
 because at the end of the day let's say that there 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.430
 we extract stones that are used in 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.100
 the construction and what we do here 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.250
 as well commented before marÃ­a del mar 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.680
 Well, let's say it's a job 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.360
 environmentally purely said but 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.460
 related to the sector of 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.220
 construction say it here 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.240
 we fulfill that triple benefit 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.030
 environmental restoration of a 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:46.230
 natural landscape protected from let's say 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:49.800
 circulate 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.870
 waste that is being an aggregate 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.270
 recycled with which life is increased 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.870
 useful of the product and good therefore 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.870
 it is a 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.760
 let's say it belongs to the sector of the 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.170
 construction and as I said before 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.720
 Maria the sea, I think the truth is 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.300
 what 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.510
 I told him that we have passed the 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.100
 true that moments and times quite 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.520
 complicated not only because of the crisis 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:20.330
 but because of the unfair competition that 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.950
 not blamed us and as told me that 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:23.990
 it's a matter of insisting and I say more than 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.400
 to insist is to resist why insist 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.340
 we have insisted and we will continue insisting 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.379
 but I resist it I do not know 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.540
 to where we are going to be able to arrive because 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:37.590
 the truth that we are not having it 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.180
 nothing easy despite being the only 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.400
 recycling plant that there is throughout the 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.110
 Canarian community and despite being the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.140
 only inert landfill that exists 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.540
 with which is to have tails of 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.099
 Inbound and outbound trucks with 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.250
 recycled aggregate since there is no such 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:56.280
 kind of products and we all have to 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:58.440
 bet on recycling and others but 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.750
 well the reality is not that therefore 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.190
 we will continue to insist and we will try 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.190
 to continue resisting
