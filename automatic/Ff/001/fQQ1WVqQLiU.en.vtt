00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
pencil you can use if you draw your

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.779 
pencil you can use if you draw your
outline<00:00:24.600> really<00:00:25.320> lightly<00:00:25.619> when<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.369> go<00:00:26.640> back

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
outline really lightly when you go back

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.790 
outline really lightly when you go back
in<00:00:26.849> with<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.449> darker<00:00:27.810> color<00:00:28.050> this<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.680> won't

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
in with the darker color this you won't

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.279 
in with the darker color this you won't
be<00:00:28.949> able<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.189> see<00:00:29.369> this<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.929> this<00:00:30.929> allows<00:00:31.260> for

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
be able to see this and this allows for

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.100 
be able to see this and this allows for
room<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.250> adjust<00:00:32.910> your<00:00:33.149> composition<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:33.989> so

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
room to adjust your composition and so

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.330 
room to adjust your composition and so
forth<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.500> I'm<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.739> going<00:00:34.890> to<00:00:34.950> loosely

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
forth so I'm just going to loosely

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.299 
forth so I'm just going to loosely
outline<00:00:36.500> what<00:00:37.500> I'm<00:00:37.620> drawing<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.040> and

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
outline what I'm drawing here and

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.799 
outline what I'm drawing here and
actually<00:00:38.430> I'm<00:00:38.910> looking<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.480> maybe<00:00:39.809> doing<00:00:40.230> it

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
actually I'm looking at maybe doing it

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.700 
actually I'm looking at maybe doing it
vertical<00:00:42.890> but<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.940> think<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.300> will

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:45.710 
vertical but for this one I think I will

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.639 
vertical but for this one I think I will
actually<00:00:46.710> I'm<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> add<00:00:47.640> just<00:00:48.410> for<00:00:49.410> I

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
actually I'm going to add just for I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.049 
actually I'm going to add just for I
like<00:00:50.600> odd<00:00:51.600> numbers<00:00:52.879> for<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> better

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
like odd numbers for a better

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.850 
like odd numbers for a better
composition<00:00:54.480> so<00:00:54.960> I'm<00:00:55.199> going<00:00:55.379> to<00:00:55.410> start<00:00:55.530> over

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
composition so I'm going to start over

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.619 
composition so I'm going to start over
here<00:00:56.010> with<00:00:56.070> this<00:00:56.280> wooden<00:00:56.610> bottle<00:00:57.000> I'm<00:00:57.449> just

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
here with this wooden bottle I'm just

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.500 
here with this wooden bottle I'm just
going<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.809> really<00:00:58.230> lightly<00:00:59.090> kind<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.180> trace

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
going to really lightly kind of trace

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:05.870 
going to really lightly kind of trace
this<00:01:00.780> here<00:01:02.120> not<00:01:03.120> trace<00:01:03.449> I'm<00:01:03.660> drawing<00:01:03.930> but<00:01:04.880> kind

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
this here not trace I'm drawing but kind

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.399 
this here not trace I'm drawing but kind
of<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.119> loosely<00:01:06.450> get<00:01:06.750> my<00:01:06.900> outline<00:01:09.320> kind<00:01:10.320> of

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
of just loosely get my outline kind of

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:19.360 
of just loosely get my outline kind of
lay<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.830> this<00:01:11.490> piece<00:01:11.790> out

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:36.040 

I'm<00:01:19.940> gonna<00:01:20.180> come<00:01:20.390> in<00:01:20.570> and<00:01:20.690> get<00:01:20.810> the<00:01:21.560> seal

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050

and his head's a little bit bigger but

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.260 
and his head's a little bit bigger but
that's<00:01:40.040> the<00:01:40.250> good<00:01:40.400> thing<00:01:40.460> about<00:01:40.610> this<00:01:40.970> if<00:01:41.180> you

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
that's the good thing about this if you

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.020 
that's the good thing about this if you
make<00:01:41.840> a<00:01:41.870> mistake<00:01:42.190> when<00:01:43.190> you<00:01:43.310> get<00:01:43.490> back<00:01:43.670> into<00:01:43.880> it

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
back there I'm just trying to indicate

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.340 
back there I'm just trying to indicate
where<00:02:04.610> it's<00:02:04.790> at<00:02:04.940> i<00:02:04.970> don't<00:02:05.150> need<00:02:05.360> to<00:02:05.450> get<00:02:05.660> real

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
where it's at i don't need to get real

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.900 
where it's at i don't need to get real
detailed<00:02:06.830> because<00:02:07.070> we're<00:02:07.190> going<00:02:07.340> to<00:02:07.400> do<00:02:07.700> that

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
detailed because we're going to do that

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.360 
detailed because we're going to do that
later<00:02:08.770> in<00:02:10.270> the<00:02:11.270> program<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:11.990> this<00:02:12.950> is<00:02:13.100> drawing

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
later in the program so this is drawing

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.130 
later in the program so this is drawing
with<00:02:13.520> the<00:02:13.610> baby<00:02:13.790> blue<00:02:13.970> pencil<00:02:14.540> get<00:02:14.960> your

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
with the baby blue pencil get your

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.660 
with the baby blue pencil get your
outline<00:02:15.470> and<00:02:15.770> get<00:02:15.980> your<00:02:16.130> composition<00:02:16.700> down

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
outline and get your composition down

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
outline and get your composition down
and<00:02:21.010> once<00:02:22.010> we<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:22.430> this<00:02:22.700> we<00:02:23.030> won't<00:02:23.240> really<00:02:23.420> need

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
and once we do this we won't really need

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.380 
and once we do this we won't really need
this<00:02:23.870> pencil<00:02:24.290> anymore<00:02:25.060> and<00:02:26.110> that's<00:02:27.110> it
