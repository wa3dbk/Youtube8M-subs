00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.770 
guess you could say towards my family
and<00:01:44.520> that's<00:01:44.610> probably<00:01:45.240> I<00:01:45.270> think<00:01:45.390> that's<00:01:45.720> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
and that's probably I think that's the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.960 
and that's probably I think that's the
only<00:01:45.810> tattoos<00:01:46.229> I've<00:01:46.380> had<00:01:46.590> since<00:01:47.009> um<00:01:47.600> since<00:01:49.970> my

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
only tattoos I've had since um since my

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.940 
only tattoos I've had since um since my
last<00:01:51.119> update<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.689> move<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.470> some<00:01:52.619> questions

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
last update I move on to some questions

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.859 
last update I move on to some questions
now<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> questions<00:01:53.759> were<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.390> number<00:01:54.750> one

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
now the questions were the number one

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.330 
now the questions were the number one
question<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.380> how<00:01:55.560> much<00:01:55.649> have<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.890> spent<00:01:56.130> on<00:01:56.250> my

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
question was how much have I spent on my

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.080 
question was how much have I spent on my
tattoos<00:01:56.640> I<00:01:57.740> probably<00:01:58.740> spent<00:01:59.130> about<00:01:59.189> 600

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
tattoos I probably spent about 600

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.899 
tattoos I probably spent about 600
pounds<00:02:00.390> of<00:02:00.450> my<00:02:00.540> tattoos<00:02:00.899> whereas<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:02.040> I<00:02:02.369> was<00:02:02.549> if

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
pounds of my tattoos whereas if I was if

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.999 
pounds of my tattoos whereas if I was if
I<00:02:03.210> didn't<00:02:03.659> know<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:04.049> artist<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.710> would<00:02:04.890> have

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
I didn't know the artist I would have

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.609 
I didn't know the artist I would have
been<00:02:05.670> somewhere<00:02:06.119> near<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.630> grand<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.409> a<00:02:07.439> half

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
been somewhere near the grand and a half

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.630 
been somewhere near the grand and a half
to<00:02:07.860> grand<00:02:08.190> range<00:02:08.429> but<00:02:09.149> I<00:02:10.009> get<00:02:11.009> my<00:02:11.129> tattoos<00:02:11.430> for

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.940 
to grand range but I get my tattoos for
a<00:02:11.670> lot<00:02:11.819> cheaper<00:02:11.849> than<00:02:12.180> normal<00:02:13.020> people<00:02:13.110> do

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
a lot cheaper than normal people do

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.190 
a lot cheaper than normal people do
because<00:02:14.430> I<00:02:14.640> personally<00:02:15.270> know<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.600> artist<00:02:15.990> and
