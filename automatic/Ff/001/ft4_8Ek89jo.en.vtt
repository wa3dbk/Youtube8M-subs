showing<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.660> how<00:00:06.870> i<00:00:07.940> use<00:00:08.940> folder<00:00:09.750> templates

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
showing you how i use folder templates

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.700 
showing you how i use folder templates
so<00:00:12.210> in<00:00:12.330> this<00:00:12.420> example<00:00:12.599> I've<00:00:13.139> got<00:00:13.349> a<00:00:13.380> folder

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
so in this example I've got a folder

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.880 
so in this example I've got a folder
called<00:00:13.860> clients<00:00:14.490> and<00:00:15.049> in<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.350> I've<00:00:16.680> got<00:00:16.859> a

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
called clients and in that I've got a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.220 
called clients and in that I've got a
client<00:00:17.100> one<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.760> after<00:00:18.029> I've<00:00:18.390> worked<00:00:19.140> with

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
client one and after I've worked with

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.330 
client one and after I've worked with
this<00:00:19.380> for<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.619> while<00:00:19.680> I've<00:00:19.890> kind<00:00:20.100> of<00:00:20.130> got<00:00:20.310> a

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
this for a while I've kind of got a

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.599 
this for a while I've kind of got a
standard<00:00:20.880> set<00:00:21.810> up<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.230> what<00:00:22.710> I<00:00:22.740> won't<00:00:23.010> meet<00:00:23.400> in

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
standard set up of what I won't meet in

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.179 
standard set up of what I won't meet in
all<00:00:23.730> my<00:00:23.880> client<00:00:24.240> folders<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:25.619> what<00:00:25.800> I<00:00:25.830> will<00:00:25.949> do

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
all my client folders so what I will do

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.210 
all my client folders so what I will do
is<00:00:26.220> I<00:00:26.460> will<00:00:26.490> take<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.359> create<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.380> folder

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
is I will take that and create a folder

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.630 
is I will take that and create a folder
called<00:00:29.580> Z<00:00:29.910> underscore<00:00:30.510> template<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.640> create

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
called Z underscore template and create

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.299 
called Z underscore template and create
all<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.120> structure<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.930> I<00:00:33.989> that<00:00:34.440> I<00:00:34.469> need<00:00:34.710> for

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
all the structure that I that I need for

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.430 
all the structure that I that I need for
future<00:00:36.030> clients<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> reason<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:36.899> call<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.200> Z

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
future clients the reason I call it Z

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.020 
future clients the reason I call it Z
underscore<00:00:37.920> template<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.640> keeps<00:00:38.850> it

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
underscore template is that keeps it

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.060 
underscore template is that keeps it
sorted<00:00:39.540> at<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.780> bottom<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.230> my<00:00:40.379> list<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.950> it

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
sorted at the bottom of my list so it

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.670 
sorted at the bottom of my list so it
doesn't<00:00:41.520> clutter<00:00:41.700> anything<00:00:42.090> up<00:00:42.440> also<00:00:43.440> if<00:00:43.590> you

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
doesn't clutter anything up also if you

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.830 
doesn't clutter anything up also if you
notice<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.280> folders<00:00:44.670> I've<00:00:44.850> created<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.510> begin

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
notice the folders I've created I begin

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.959 
notice the folders I've created I begin
with<00:00:46.050> an<00:00:46.170> underscore<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:47.039> keeps<00:00:47.670> them<00:00:47.820> at

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
with an underscore that keeps them at

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.139 
with an underscore that keeps them at
the<00:00:48.059> top<00:00:48.270> of<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.539> list<00:00:49.010> in<00:00:50.010> my<00:00:50.070> client<00:00:50.850> folders

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
the top of the list in my client folders

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.979 
the top of the list in my client folders
so<00:00:52.140> this<00:00:52.829> can<00:00:52.980> be<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.160> many<00:00:53.340> level<00:00:53.699> deep<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.809> as

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
so this can be as many level deep in as

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.080 
so this can be as many level deep in as
many<00:00:55.140> levels<00:00:55.410> deep<00:00:55.680> as<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.190> need<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:56.610> here

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
many levels deep as you need so here

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.540 
many levels deep as you need so here
under<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.719> template<00:00:58.379> I<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.739> a<00:00:58.770> notes<00:00:59.070> folder

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
under the template I have a notes folder

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.670 
under the template I have a notes folder
and<00:00:59.699> in<00:01:00.270> that<00:01:00.510> folder<00:01:00.960> I've<00:01:01.260> got<00:01:01.469> maybe

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and in that folder I've got maybe

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.619 
and in that folder I've got maybe
something<00:01:02.129> called<00:01:02.309> access<00:01:02.760> info<00:01:03.149> which<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.600> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
something called access info which is a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.780 
something called access info which is a
text<00:01:04.530> file<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.830> may<00:01:05.010> be<00:01:05.070> as<00:01:05.250> information

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790

and now I have my client one my client

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.750 
and now I have my client one my client
too<00:01:38.190> and<00:01:39.120> it's<00:01:39.300> all<00:01:39.480> set<00:01:39.720> up<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:39.900> my<00:01:40.890> standard

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
set up for a client and then if I need

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.440 
set up for a client and then if I need
to<00:01:43.440> create<00:01:43.680> new<00:01:44.310> folders<00:01:44.730> i<00:01:44.850> can<00:01:45.000> create<00:01:45.150> them

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
to create new folders i can create them

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.230 
to create new folders i can create them
here<00:01:48.470> as<00:01:49.470> well<00:01:49.760> now<00:01:50.760> one<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> big

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
here as well now one of the big

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.770 
here as well now one of the big
advantages<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:52.680> isn't<00:01:53.310> so<00:01:53.490> much<00:01:53.780> just

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
advantages of this isn't so much just

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.000 
advantages of this isn't so much just
that<00:01:54.900> I<00:01:54.990> don't<00:01:55.020> have<00:01:55.260> to<00:01:55.410> create<00:01:55.710> all<00:01:55.860> these

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:56.010 
that I don't have to create all these

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:57.800 
that I don't have to create all these
folders<00:01:56.400> from<00:01:56.580> from<00:01:56.970> scratch<00:01:57.330> there's<00:01:57.660> two

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
folders from from scratch there's two

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.320 
folders from from scratch there's two
really<00:01:58.050> big<00:01:58.290> advantages<00:01:58.830> one<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.430> whenever<00:02:00.180> I

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
really big advantages one is whenever I

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.270 
really big advantages one is whenever I
need<00:02:00.510> to<00:02:00.600> save<00:02:00.840> a<00:02:00.870> piece<00:02:01.200> of<00:02:01.229> information<00:02:01.650> I've

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
need to save a piece of information I've

not trying to create a new folder to put

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.790 
not trying to create a new folder to put
it<00:02:09.270> in<00:02:09.450> or<00:02:09.660> worse<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.170> putting<00:02:10.440> it<00:02:10.560> in<00:02:10.619> kind

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
it in or worse just putting it in kind

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.520 
it in or worse just putting it in kind
of<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.040> top<00:02:11.250> level<00:02:11.670> for<00:02:12.420> that<00:02:12.600> client<00:02:12.810> the

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
of the top level for that client the

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.290 
of the top level for that client the
other<00:02:13.709> big<00:02:13.950> advantage<00:02:14.459> is<00:02:14.610> when<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:14.970> comes<00:02:15.150> to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
other big advantage is when it comes to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.360 
other big advantage is when it comes to
look<00:02:15.570> for<00:02:15.810> information<00:02:15.959> it's<00:02:16.650> very<00:02:16.890> easy<00:02:17.160> to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
look for information it's very easy to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.640 
look for information it's very easy to
find<00:02:17.880> because<00:02:18.239> everything<00:02:18.840> for<00:02:19.110> each<00:02:19.380> client

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
find because everything for each client

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.060 
find because everything for each client
is<00:02:19.920> in<00:02:20.070> the<00:02:20.160> same<00:02:20.370> place<00:02:20.930> and<00:02:21.930> as<00:02:22.530> I<00:02:22.739> work<00:02:22.920> with

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
is in the same place and as I work with

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.530 
is in the same place and as I work with
clients<00:02:23.280> if<00:02:23.610> I<00:02:23.700> discover<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.330> there's

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
clients if I discover that there's

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.970 
clients if I discover that there's
another<00:02:24.810> particular<00:02:25.290> type<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.530> Boulder<00:02:25.950> that

another particular type of Boulder that

another particular type of Boulder that
that<00:02:26.640> I<00:02:26.760> mean<00:02:26.940> very<00:02:27.090> commonly<00:02:27.600> I'll<00:02:27.870> just<00:02:28.709> add

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
that I mean very commonly I'll just add

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.470 
that I mean very commonly I'll just add
it<00:02:28.950> to<00:02:29.160> my<00:02:29.280> template<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:29.820> then<00:02:29.880> it's<00:02:30.239> their

it to my template and then it's their
next<00:02:31.170> time<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.320> create<00:02:31.620> a<00:02:31.680> client<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:33.390> type

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
next time I create a client so this type

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.800 
next time I create a client so this type
of<00:02:33.680> structure<00:02:34.680> can<00:02:35.070> be<00:02:35.100> used<00:02:35.430> for<00:02:35.640> I'm<00:02:36.000> showing

you here being used for clients you can

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.090 
you here being used for clients you can
use<00:02:38.700> something<00:02:39.330> similar<00:02:39.540> for<00:02:40.140> any<00:02:40.590> time<00:02:40.920> that
