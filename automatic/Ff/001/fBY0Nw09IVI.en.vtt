00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
but yeah I basically did this video

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.539 
but yeah I basically did this video
straight<00:02:03.840> through<00:02:03.990> Slayer<00:02:04.290> every<00:02:05.250> time<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.430> got

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
straight through Slayer every time I got

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.340 
straight through Slayer every time I got
a<00:02:05.610> task<00:02:05.850> I<00:02:06.119> would<00:02:06.180> kill<00:02:06.570> them<00:02:06.600> so<00:02:07.049> I<00:02:07.079> eventually

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
a task I would kill them so I eventually

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.949 
a task I would kill them so I eventually
got<00:02:07.649> to<00:02:07.799> 1,000<00:02:08.369> kills<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:09.000> did<00:02:09.209> take<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> while<00:02:09.539> I

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
got to 1,000 kills it did take a while I

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.240 
got to 1,000 kills it did take a while I
didn't<00:02:10.200> really<00:02:10.379> get<00:02:10.530> them<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.950> all<00:02:11.069> that

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
didn't really get them that all that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.610 
didn't really get them that all that
often<00:02:11.400> maybe<00:02:11.760> one<00:02:12.060> every<00:02:12.300> like<00:02:12.480> 20<00:02:12.840> tasks

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
often maybe one every like 20 tasks

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.140 
often maybe one every like 20 tasks
so<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.739> think<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.370> really<00:02:14.700> went<00:02:14.909> over

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
so I think that really went over

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.550 
so I think that really went over
everything<00:02:15.510> you<00:02:15.599> really<00:02:15.780> need<00:02:15.989> to<00:02:16.110> know<00:02:16.290> about

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
good in terms of like stacking money

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.809 
good in terms of like stacking money
because<00:02:49.049> like<00:02:49.230> this<00:02:49.410> steel<00:02:49.650> bar<00:02:49.890> stack<00:02:50.579> right

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
because like this steel bar stack right

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:54.229 
because like this steel bar stack right
here<00:02:50.879> is<00:02:51.150> 840<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.590> I<00:02:52.620> mean<00:02:53.069> that's<00:02:53.220> roughly<00:02:53.640> 900

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
here is 840 so I mean that's roughly 900

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.479 
here is 840 so I mean that's roughly 900
K<00:02:54.420> maybe<00:02:54.720> even<00:02:55.140> close<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.650> a<00:02:55.680> mill<00:02:55.950> just<00:02:56.280> right

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
K maybe even close to a mill just right

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.190 
K maybe even close to a mill just right
there<00:02:56.730> and<00:02:57.000> then<00:02:57.299> among<00:02:57.540> other<00:02:57.750> things<00:02:57.810> they

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
there and then among other things they

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.589 
there and then among other things they
do<00:02:58.260> drop<00:02:58.560> a<00:02:58.590> lot<00:02:58.799> of<00:02:58.950> rune<00:02:59.340> items<00:02:59.849> so<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.299> take<00:03:00.569> it

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:00.599 
do drop a lot of rune items so I take it

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.869 
do drop a lot of rune items so I take it
like<00:03:00.840> 58<00:03:01.290> room<00:03:01.590> full<00:03:01.859> Helms<00:03:02.159> so<00:03:02.400> like<00:03:02.670> right

like 58 room full Helms so like right
there<00:03:03.120> I<00:03:03.329> think<00:03:03.659> they're<00:03:03.780> like<00:03:03.900> 20k<00:03:04.230> each<00:03:04.500> like

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:04.769 
there I think they're like 20k each like

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:07.280 
there I think they're like 20k each like
okay<00:03:05.220> examine<00:03:05.760> yeah<00:03:06.329> 20k<00:03:06.720> each<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.109> right

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
okay examine yeah 20k each so right

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.410 
okay examine yeah 20k each so right
there<00:03:07.500> that's<00:03:07.799> more<00:03:08.489> than<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.760> mill<00:03:08.970> that's

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
there that's more than a mill that's

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.199 
there that's more than a mill that's
like<00:03:09.659> 1.16<00:03:10.500> mill<00:03:10.829> just<00:03:11.250> in<00:03:11.340> rune<00:03:11.549> films<00:03:12.030> but<00:03:12.180> I

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
like 1.16 mill just in rune films but I

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:13.970 
like 1.16 mill just in rune films but I
also<00:03:12.359> got<00:03:12.569> 5<00:03:12.840> granite<00:03:13.260> malls<00:03:13.440> as<00:03:13.620> well<00:03:13.769> I<00:03:13.799> think

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
also got 5 granite malls as well I think

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.399 
also got 5 granite malls as well I think
the<00:03:14.220> drop<00:03:14.400> rates<00:03:14.609> like<00:03:14.700> 1<00:03:14.879> in<00:03:14.970> 250<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:16.140> I<00:03:16.170> did

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:16.409 
the drop rates like 1 in 250 but I did

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.259 
the drop rates like 1 in 250 but I did
get<00:03:16.500> 5<00:03:16.739> so<00:03:16.950> that's<00:03:17.010> kind<00:03:17.250> of<00:03:17.280> cool<00:03:17.430> um<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:18.150> know

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
they're only like 30k so they're not

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.440 
they're only like 30k so they're not
worth<00:03:19.799> anything<00:03:19.950> but<00:03:20.849> you<00:03:21.120> know<00:03:21.150> it's<00:03:21.359> still

made so basically I got 5.8 mill in I

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.069 
made so basically I got 5.8 mill in I
want<00:03:28.349> to<00:03:28.410> say<00:03:28.620> like<00:03:28.799> 2<00:03:29.099> to<00:03:29.879> 3<00:03:30.150> hours<00:03:30.180> probably

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:31.079 
want to say like 2 to 3 hours probably

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.589 
want to say like 2 to 3 hours probably
good<00:03:31.680> estimates<00:03:32.160> like<00:03:32.250> 2<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.489> 1/2<00:03:32.519> hours<00:03:32.790> but

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:33.599 
good estimates like 2 and 1/2 hours but

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.030 
good estimates like 2 and 1/2 hours but
honestly<00:03:34.079> I'm<00:03:34.379> just<00:03:34.500> gonna<00:03:34.680> write<00:03:34.889> it<00:03:35.010> down

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
honestly I'm just gonna write it down

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.220 
honestly I'm just gonna write it down
it's<00:03:35.310> 2<00:03:35.519> hours<00:03:35.849> and<00:03:36.060> that<00:03:36.510> makes<00:03:36.750> it<00:03:36.930> pretty

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
it's 2 hours and that makes it pretty

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.470 
it's 2 hours and that makes it pretty
close<00:03:37.530> to<00:03:37.680> 3<00:03:37.889> million<00:03:38.099> hour<00:03:38.280> it's<00:03:38.489> like<00:03:38.519> 2.9<00:03:39.269> I

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
close to 3 million hour it's like 2.9 I

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.150 
close to 3 million hour it's like 2.9 I
mean<00:03:39.810> that's<00:03:39.959> not<00:03:40.079> even<00:03:40.379> that<00:03:40.530> excessive

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
mean that's not even that excessive

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.569 
mean that's not even that excessive
because<00:03:41.900> alone<00:03:42.900> these<00:03:43.139> ruins<00:03:44.069> you<00:03:44.220> get<00:03:44.310> too

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
because alone these ruins you get too

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.610 
because alone these ruins you get too
much<00:03:44.819> money<00:03:45.030> from<00:03:45.209> that<00:03:45.389> and<00:03:45.599> then<00:03:46.199> you<00:03:46.500> know

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
much money from that and then you know

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.559 
much money from that and then you know
just<00:03:46.949> in<00:03:47.459> the<00:03:47.489> rune<00:03:47.669> plate<00:03:47.879> legs<00:03:48.090> as<00:03:48.239> well<00:03:48.359> is

00:03:48.559 --> 00:03:48.569 
just in the rune plate legs as well is

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:50.990 
just in the rune plate legs as well is
about<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.989> same<00:03:49.169> value<00:03:49.560> and<00:03:49.709> in<00:03:50.549> half<00:03:50.819> the

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
about the same value and in half the

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.089 
about the same value and in half the
drops<00:03:51.269> so<00:03:51.660> I<00:03:51.930> mean<00:03:52.139> you<00:03:52.290> can<00:03:52.410> easily<00:03:52.650> expect

00:03:53.089 --> 00:03:53.099 
drops so I mean you can easily expect

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.939 
drops so I mean you can easily expect

considering these guys dropped very bad
drops<00:04:05.549> before<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:06.239> update<00:04:06.389> it's<00:04:07.230> really<00:04:07.470> nice

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
to see that they're actually a

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.430 
to see that they're actually a
profitable<00:04:09.150> task<00:04:09.359> keep<00:04:09.840> in<00:04:09.989> mind<00:04:10.199> this<00:04:10.319> was

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
profitable task keep in mind this was

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.379 
profitable task keep in mind this was
only<00:04:10.620> like<00:04:10.799> four<00:04:10.829> tasks<00:04:11.519> so<00:04:11.730> per<00:04:11.910> task<00:04:12.120> I'm

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:12.389 
only like four tasks so per task I'm
