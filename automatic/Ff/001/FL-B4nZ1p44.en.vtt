is nice quads and definition i would say

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.060 
is nice quads and definition i would say
it<00:01:20.140> depends<00:01:20.770> on<00:01:22.080> for<00:01:23.080> nice<00:01:23.260> closet<00:01:23.650> definition

definition<00:01:31.960> is<00:01:32.080> definitely<00:01:32.500> going<00:01:32.590> to<00:01:32.680> depend

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
definition is definitely going to depend

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.000
