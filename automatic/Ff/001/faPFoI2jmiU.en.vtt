show<00:01:35.469> you<00:01:35.530> the<00:01:35.740> tilt<00:01:36.130> angles<00:01:36.520> this<00:01:37.509> is<00:01:37.719> the

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
show you the tilt angles this is the

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.139 
show you the tilt angles this is the
maximum<00:01:38.170> that<00:01:38.320> it<00:01:38.500> will<00:01:38.619> tilt<00:01:38.850> or<00:01:39.850> all<00:01:40.000> that

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
maximum that it will tilt or all that

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.249 
maximum that it will tilt or all that
great<00:01:40.390> tilt<00:01:40.960> angle<00:01:41.229> actually<00:01:41.590> in<00:01:41.890> see<00:01:43.259> it

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:44.259 
great tilt angle actually in see it

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:47.880 
great tilt angle actually in see it
slimmer<00:01:44.590> than<00:01:44.770> the<00:01:44.829> c8<00:01:45.219> 5<00:01:45.490> 0<00:01:45.820> but<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:47.560> can<00:01:47.740> see

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
slimmer than the c8 5 0 but you can see

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.670 
slimmer than the c8 5 0 but you can see
this<00:01:48.070> tilt<00:01:48.369> angles<00:01:49.140> one<00:01:50.140> and<00:01:50.289> twenty<00:01:50.560> degrees

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
this tilt angles one and twenty degrees

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.240 
this tilt angles one and twenty degrees
odd<00:01:52.229> this<00:01:53.229> is<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.439> way<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.649> laptop<00:01:53.799> looks
