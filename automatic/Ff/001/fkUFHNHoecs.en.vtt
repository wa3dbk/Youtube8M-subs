00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello dear friends google 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.740
 released a significant update android under 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.690
 name kitkat chocolate android 4 4 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.040
 excellent pro back in world advertising 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.199
 thanks to this barter us 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.749
 cooperation but the most important thing here 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.999
 what is there to show to see 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:23.460
 easter egg enough as always 

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:25.169
 enter settings and press several times 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.689
 on line from the system version 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.789
 there are still letters to which 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.009
 also need to click to finally 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.420
 jumped picture android drawn 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.370
 kitkat style logo 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.679
 Let's start with the fact that the changes affected 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.019
 main screen system first icons 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:42.239
 have become a lot more on the five-inch 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.339
 nexus 5 looks beautiful 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.890
 between the bottom dock and the desktop you 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.899
 see two points it means that here 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.879
 just one desktop and google 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.999
 now in android if on the desktop 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.100
 nothing is removed but these tables 

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.379
 you can add as much as you like 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.809
 twenty and the tables can be done 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.120
 just to the left of the left is google 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.850
 it looks like a spotlight in with 6 or more 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.829
 early versions of the system is quite convenient 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.869
 chip by the way and at the same time 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.149
 google desktop can be accessed by 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.130
 old fashioned pulling from the bottom up and down 

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:16.439
 The screen is now transparent bars 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.210
 and the icons in the top bar changed color with 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.700
 blue on white it looks better 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.950
 the earlier the roboto font also became different 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.079
 it is more elongated but recycling 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.969
 really beautifully made strip 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.619
 google too slightly changed she 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:30.869
 takes place in the place where you 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.939
 push functionality and then not all 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.579
 but it looks very impressive but 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.710
 functional here too added now this 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.479
 not just web search using this 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.149
 lines you can search for contacts and 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:45.060
 applications let's introduce sergey 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:47.729
 or you can enter antutu undoubtedly 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.439
 comfortable useful thing top statusbar 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.320
 nothing has changed just in togas 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.689
 there was a location button but 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.549
 changed the open application button and 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.560
 if you click on it you can see that 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.840
 there are no more tab widgets that 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.579
 honestly always annoying now 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.009
 here only applications are all the same 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.320
 large icons some widgets now 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.630
 is in another place if clamped 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.540
 screen on android 4 4 in any empty 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.790
 the area will open such a menu 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.129
 here you can choose wallpaper widgets and 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.909
 settings can also be swapped 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:19.280
 work tables 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.920
 just hold down 1 and move 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.750
 anywhere in the personalization settings 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.670
 you can enable or disable google 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.250
 can customize the search on the phone 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.750
 voice search and so on so let's 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.849
 back to the desktop 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.040
 some icons were redrawn 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.750
 changed phone application icon well 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.609
 and in general the application itself has changed 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.069
 Immediately a screen appears with your favorites. 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.200
 contacts if you are too lazy to make them 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.540
 manually then there will often appear 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.010
 called contacts to open 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.680
 dialer you need to click on 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.260
 The center button looks like a new one. 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.510
 Tyler has a great feature in android 4 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.430
 4 if you call an unknown number 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.620
 the phone can take the name and avatar 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.810
 caller from his google profile plus 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.540
 the function is cool but in Russia is extremely 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:04.489
 non-working think you understand what I mean 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.859
 go ahead has changed a bit 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.340
 the clock font app is now single 

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:09.439
 thickness 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.810
 and from below appeared the planet icon which 

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:13.459
 allows you to add cities 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.180
 hangouts application swallowed the application 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.799
 messages 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.139
 now this is one service which 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.750
 determines whether the number is bound hengauts 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.500
 or not, that is, we get an analogue image 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.750
 on ios 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.239
 if your interlocutor's number is tied 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.459
 to hengauts get free messages 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.519
 if not go expensive messages 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.590
 by gsm connection it's nice what people think in google 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:35.269
 about their users so they 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:36.379
 left the opportunity to choose a program 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.940
 for with ms 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.250
 for this you need to go to the settings 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.859
 press the button and then the item 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.079
 an application for sharing with here 

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.669
 choose the appropriate program will not 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.069
 exit settings as there is 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:51.709
 another cool feature if done 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:53.810
 the system language in English will appear however 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.359
 brook shaya opportunity you saw 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.979
 in moto x go to the desktop and 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:02.150
 Now you can manage voice search 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:05.409
 no arms ok google dick sixth sense yo 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.409
 red series president 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:11.319
 This is how it works, but not only 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.120
 Because of the search, there are still voice calls. 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.920
 teams that also work only on 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:19.930
 english injury let's say 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:22.210
 ok google alarms m m m m like that without hands 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.130
 you can set the alarm clock commands of course 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.789
 not so much like a siri but none the less 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.039
 google 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:28.539
 goes to this in Russian all this 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:31.060
 did not work unfortunately 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:33.400
 android 4 4 should work on many 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.320
 devices held huge here 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.870
 optimization work appeared 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:40.180
 support for devices with 512 megabytes 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.039
 RAM itself android should 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.289
 work faster therefore already 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:45.039
 unofficial port for nexus s and galaxy 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:47.349
 nexus 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.419
 working with multitasking outwardly nothing 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:52.150
 not changed but google promises to save 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:54.099
 all from long hang hopping yes 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.259
 and in general the system is less to eat the battery 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:58.120
 but about the battery was taken care of and 

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.590
 the other side is now music with 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.259
 you can listen to the screen off 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.360
 a little longer by 20 30 percent on 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:07.690
 iphone let's say you can listen to music 40 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:09.580
 hours on nexus 5 60 not switching topics 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.150
 I will tell about music about one more piece 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.310
 systems 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.740
 now if the music plays that 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.990
 going on now the cover will be shown 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:19.720
 on the locked screen the chip is 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.830
 taken saves like another chip you see 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.349
 bottom camera icon 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.539
 strongly resembles as-7 only here 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:27.460
 camera moves to the right and up there 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.430
 there is a tick below 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.960
 it opens google in android 4 4 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.360
 quick office applications become 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.220
 standard google bought this company 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.199
 just recently but still work 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.000
 it was quickly done quite by the way 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:41.979
 nice application there is integration 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.130
 with google drive so documents can 

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:47.409
 open immediately from there back in android 4 4 

00:05:45.130 --> 00:05:49.419
 printer support for printing has appeared 

00:05:47.409 --> 00:05:51.759
 you can send a document picture or 

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:53.650
 webpage work happens either with 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:54.669
 using google cloud either separately with 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:56.979
 hp printers 

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.539
 naturally not quite printers go 

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.909
 Next is now built into the system. 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:02.530
 management application and to ports in 

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:04.780
 nexus 5 it is not, therefore, and show 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:05.500
 nothing much has been fixed and 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.360
 supplemented 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.460
 let's work with games improved 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.560
 Wy-fi support appeared miracast 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.480
 still now you can record video with 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.460
 android screen without extra attachments 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:18.040
 not true you need to connect 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.050
 with respect to a d b a computer with the help of adobe 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:21.790
 You can run and display the battery 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.990
 percent as already shown on screen 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:25.060
 my nexus 5 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:27.310
 whereby the value of the battery is shown 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.440
 only when the charge is less than 40 percent 

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:32.260
 basically I find the logic in this 

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:34.450
 very cool thing fullscreen 

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:36.430
 Now in many applications will not be 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.500
 show the bottom button but you can 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:41.230
 return for this you need to hold from 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:43.570
 screen bottom up or top down very 

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:46.150
 useful thing and relevant not only in 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.010
 readings but also in google games of work 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.760
 on to android 4 4 got to 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:51.160
 keyboard 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.230
 Swipe now works without any 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:54.910
 separation to start a new word you need 

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:56.950
 hold your finger up to a space and then 

00:06:54.910 --> 00:06:59.020
 back at all here on the keyboard has become 

00:06:56.950 --> 00:07:01.510
 work better understanding of touch 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.820
 again yes shroud except all those new 

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:05.770
 I told about the chips I am sure that 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:08.620
 In the system there are many small invisible but 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:11.680
 useful changes android 4 4 became 

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:13.570
 the perfect android 2013 cool 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:15.880
 that removed all unnecessary systems and added 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:17.890
 all useful there is no reason to praise il not 

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:19.630
 I personally praise after such a start 

00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:22.090
 I refuse the new launcher and others 

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:24.130
 custom chips as in android 4 4 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.260
 Everything suits me and I think many 

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:28.990
 arrange and arrange can only wish 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.390
 speedy upgrade to android 4 4 not 

00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:33.070
 Be sure to also see the nexus 5 review. 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.140
