00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
cook up a lot of bacon I feel like most

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.860 
cook up a lot of bacon I feel like most
people<00:00:48.440> use<00:00:48.710> a<00:00:49.039> spatula<00:00:49.670> to<00:00:50.059> flip<00:00:50.300> their<00:00:50.539> bacon

but<00:00:51.109> I'd<00:00:51.289> rather<00:00:51.410> use<00:00:51.679> pair<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:51.980> tongs<00:00:52.160> I<00:00:52.550> just

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
but I'd rather use pair of tongs I just

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.060 
but I'd rather use pair of tongs I just
find<00:00:53.480> so<00:00:53.899> much<00:00:54.050> easier<00:00:54.739> to<00:00:54.890> control

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:55.070

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.570 
we're going to use two green onions so

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.450 
we're going to use two green onions so
you<00:01:17.660> set<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.900> rest<00:01:18.020> of<00:01:18.200> side<00:01:18.410> and<00:01:18.800> we're<00:01:19.340> going

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
you set the rest of side and we're going

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.740 
you set the rest of side and we're going
to<00:01:19.490> chop<00:01:19.730> them<00:01:19.850> up<00:01:19.970> finely<00:01:20.420> cut<00:01:20.990> off<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.260> ends

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
to chop them up finely cut off the ends

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.970 
to chop them up finely cut off the ends
then<00:01:25.690> the<00:01:26.690> finer<00:01:26.990> you<00:01:27.230> can<00:01:27.380> chop<00:01:27.620> them<00:01:27.830> is

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
probably the better because you don't

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.100 
probably the better because you don't
really<00:01:30.950> taste<00:01:31.250> the<00:01:31.430> chunks<00:01:31.730> green<00:01:32.720> onion<00:01:32.990> you
