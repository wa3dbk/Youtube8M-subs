00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
shins mind-boggling mind game or

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.259 
shins mind-boggling mind game or
something<00:00:23.010> like<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:23.490> idea<00:00:23.519> is<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.029> you

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
something like that the idea is that you

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.200 
something like that the idea is that you
want<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.510> see<00:00:24.689> how<00:00:24.869> many<00:00:25.109> of<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.410> his<00:00:25.650> feathers

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
want to see how many of the his feathers

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.870 
want to see how many of the his feathers
you<00:00:27.210> can<00:00:27.390> push<00:00:27.599> down<00:00:27.769> without<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.640> dark

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
you can push down without the the dark

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.280 
you can push down without the the dark
coming<00:00:30.240> out<00:00:30.679> the<00:00:31.679> idea<00:00:32.040> is<00:00:32.130> you<00:00:32.850> know<00:00:33.290> they

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
coming out the idea is you know they

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.720 
coming out the idea is you know they
make<00:00:34.469> it<00:00:34.590> sound<00:00:34.800> like<00:00:35.040> there's<00:00:35.280> some<00:00:35.489> pattern

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
make it sound like there's some pattern

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.440 
make it sound like there's some pattern
that<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.149> could<00:00:36.300> follow<00:00:36.739> that<00:00:38.180> would<00:00:39.180> get<00:00:39.360> to

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
that you could follow that would get to

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.760 
that you could follow that would get to
get<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.809> that<00:00:39.960> you<00:00:40.050> could<00:00:40.170> always<00:00:40.350> get<00:00:40.680> it

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
get it so that you could always get it

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.600 
get it so that you could always get it
to<00:00:40.860> shoot<00:00:41.129> on<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.870> on<00:00:42.870> the<00:00:43.829> fourth<00:00:44.600> hit<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:47.489> if

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
to shoot on the on the fourth hit and if

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.889 
to shoot on the on the fourth hit and if
you<00:00:47.700> mess<00:00:47.850> around<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.300> long<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.780> bad

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
you mess around that long and that bad

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.290 
you mess around that long and that bad
you<00:00:48.989> can<00:00:49.140> see<00:00:49.260> right<00:00:49.410> here<00:00:49.760> there<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.969> did<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.239> on

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
you can see right here there I did it on

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.110 
you can see right here there I did it on
the<00:00:51.360> fourth<00:00:51.600> hit<00:00:52.489> it<00:00:53.489> turns<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:53.940> actually

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the fourth hit it turns out actually

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.700 
the fourth hit it turns out actually
when<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.539> pull<00:00:54.719> this<00:00:54.840> thing<00:00:55.079> apart<00:00:55.110> that

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
when you pull this thing apart that

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.520 
when you pull this thing apart that
there<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.370> no<00:00:57.079> mind-boggling<00:00:58.079> mind<00:00:58.289> game<00:00:58.500> to

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
there is no mind-boggling mind game to

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.529 
there is no mind-boggling mind game to
be<00:00:58.770> solved<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.520> actually<00:01:00.120> completely

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
be solved it's actually completely

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.009 
be solved it's actually completely
random<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:01.170> got<00:01:01.800> two<00:01:01.980> of<00:01:02.160> these<00:01:02.280> because<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.120> have

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
random I got two of these because I have

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.399 
random I got two of these because I have
two<00:01:04.229> kids<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.860> they<00:01:05.159> each<00:01:05.339> got<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.580> happy<00:01:05.790> meal

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:06.409 
two kids and they each got a happy meal

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.510 
two kids and they each got a happy meal
so<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.439> went<00:01:07.680> ahead<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.890> pulled<00:01:08.130> one<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.430> them

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
so I went ahead and pulled one of them

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.980 
so I went ahead and pulled one of them
apart<00:01:08.880> here's<00:01:09.210> what<00:01:09.420> it<00:01:09.510> looks<00:01:09.630> like<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.900> the

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
apart here's what it looks like on the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.800 
apart here's what it looks like on the
inside<00:01:10.110> if<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.680> see<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.820> okay

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
inside if you can see that okay

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.530 
inside if you can see that okay
now<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:14.040> way<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.310> thing<00:01:14.580> actually<00:01:14.729> works<00:01:14.970> is

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
now the way this thing actually works is

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.359 
now the way this thing actually works is
there's<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.840> black<00:01:16.110> disc<00:01:16.409> right<00:01:16.680> here<00:01:16.740> that

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
there's a black disc right here that

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.950 
there's a black disc right here that
moves<00:01:17.610> around<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.150> selects<00:01:18.540> which<00:01:18.659> of<00:01:18.869> these

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
moves around and selects which of these

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.810 
moves around and selects which of these
is<00:01:19.140> going<00:01:19.290> to<00:01:19.350> actually<00:01:19.799> launch<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.580> dart

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
is going to actually launch the dart

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.450 
is going to actually launch the dart
when<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.150> pressed<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:22.500> disc<00:01:22.740> will<00:01:23.040> advance

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
when it's pressed the disc will advance

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.880 
when it's pressed the disc will advance
exactly<00:01:24.030> one<00:01:24.270> place<00:01:24.780> when<00:01:25.409> the<00:01:25.500> dart<00:01:25.710> is

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
exactly one place when the dart is

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.420 
exactly one place when the dart is
inserted<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:27.030> when<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> dark<00:01:27.479> comes<00:01:27.720> out<00:01:28.430> its

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
inserted but when the dark comes out its

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.060 
inserted but when the dark comes out its
spins<00:01:29.850> and<00:01:30.210> then<00:01:30.659> randomly<00:01:31.140> stops<00:01:31.470> at<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> place

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
spins and then randomly stops at a place

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.560 
spins and then randomly stops at a place
this<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.310> Adam<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.850> mechanism<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.390> actually

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
this is Adam this mechanism is actually

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.870 
this is Adam this mechanism is actually
very<00:01:33.930> similar<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.439> how<00:01:34.890> slot<00:01:35.220> machines<00:01:35.579> work

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
very similar to how slot machines work

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.429 
very similar to how slot machines work
in<00:01:36.090> terms<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> randomization<00:01:39.229> so<00:01:40.229> here

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
in terms of the randomization so here

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:41.990 
in terms of the randomization so here
I'm<00:01:40.560> going<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.770> actually<00:01:40.920> put<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.520> dark<00:01:41.729> in

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
I'm going to actually put the dark in

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.679 
I'm going to actually put the dark in
and<00:01:43.250> maybe<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.490> can<00:01:44.700> sort<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.149> see<00:01:45.420> how<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
and maybe you can sort of see how the

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.990 
and maybe you can sort of see how the
mechanism<00:01:46.259> advances<00:01:46.770> I<00:01:46.890> don't<00:01:47.040> know<00:01:47.159> how<00:01:47.340> my

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
mechanism advances I don't know how my

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.289 
mechanism advances I don't know how my
webcam<00:01:48.390> is<00:01:48.450> pretty<00:01:49.310> lousy<00:01:50.310> it's<00:01:50.670> just<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:51.060> my

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
webcam is pretty lousy it's just on my

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.639 
webcam is pretty lousy it's just on my
laptop<00:01:51.540> actually<00:01:52.009> but<00:01:53.009> I'll<00:01:53.070> do<00:01:53.220> my<00:01:53.340> best<00:01:54.649> so

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
laptop actually but I'll do my best so

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:56.359 
laptop actually but I'll do my best so
here<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:55.920> go

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
here we go

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.310 
here we go
pushing<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.299> dark<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.750> and<00:01:58.549> there<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.759> the

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
pushing the dark in and there it is the

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.730
