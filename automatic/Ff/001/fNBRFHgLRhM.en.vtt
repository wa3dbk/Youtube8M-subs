00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 after hours of stress 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.899
 Moscow talks and Kiev finally 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.420
 signed a gas agreement in Brussels 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.980
 previous rounds did not give results 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.870
 agreement on gas supplies to the EU countries 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.580
 saved Europe from fear of freezing 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.619
 this winter 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.449
 key points to the following agreements 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.150
 end of this year, Kiev will receive gas 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.789
 priced from 378 dollars per thousand 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.289
 cubic meters of fuel will begin to flow on 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:29.119
 Ukraine as soon as she pay part 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.920
 debt in the amount of 1.45 billion dollars 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.290
 it should happen in the coming days 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.090
 all Kiev agreed to pay Moscow 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.520
 just over three billion dollars to 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.290
 end of this year financial aid 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.730
 Ukraine will have to eat 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.640
 International Monetary Fund 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:51.239
 with details rt correspondent Peter 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:53.430
 oliver nonsense negotiations were hard 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.860
 and lasted several months at times 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.530
 it seemed that a breakthrough was about to happen 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.789
 then it all started over again 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 the final decision was to be 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.229
 announced on the evening of October 29 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.229
 but then we were told to have 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.900
 wait a little more at least 24 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.490
 hours agreement still was signed 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.530
 and it seems it is beneficial to all 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.540
 interested parties russia 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.310
 gets for your gas the amount that 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.680
 she wanted Ukraine gets 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.360
 economic support from with and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.259
 International Monetary Fund and 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.180
 European Union 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.700
 guarantees of transit of Russian gas through 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.250
 Ukraine to those European countries that 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.229
 Europe needs most fuel 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.420
 highly dependent on Russian gas in 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.420
 some countries are almost all blue 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.560
 fuel comes from russia therefore so 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.630
 it was important to conclude 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.060
 this is an eurocommissioner agreement 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.490
 power engineering gunter ettinger performed on 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.930
 negotiations the role of the main mediator he 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.750
 stressed that having signed the agreement 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.880
 Moscow and Kiev not only provided 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.380
 gas supplies to Ukraine but also 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.049
 proved to be able to find 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.030
 compromises he says it also 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.360
 was great news for such countries 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.860
 like czech republic hungary bulgaria and romania 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.759
 which strongly depends on the Russian 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.759
 gas in life 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.410
 we trust our russian partners we 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.960
 We believe that the atmosphere of trust will help 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.600
 stabilize the market 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.790
 full and by her now give the European Union gave 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.070
 understand that if Russia and Ukraine managed 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.960
 agree on gas probably in the future 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.810
 agreement can be reached on others 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.930
 issues days to the king lion and fig 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.930
