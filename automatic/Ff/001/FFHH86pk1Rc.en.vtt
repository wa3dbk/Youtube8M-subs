00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.360
 hi everyone, I am a fenix club in this tutorial and we will explain how to create 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.249
 an animation that you can do it 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.469
 absolute value so you have a character bone 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:13.949
 then 

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:19.029
 in badia in this page for which we have the time line here in fact we will see 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.109
 airframe is written 0 1 to 30 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.029
 by left clicking we can change the start value 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.340
 increasing it 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.010
 increases the duration of the video so based on this fancam I sell I sell the 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.350
 so the value of the video varies 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.580
 let's leave let 32 ​​now 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.080
 after which so we have some of this little corner, leaving the 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.080
 left mouse button moving to the right 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.550
 so on the left we are therefore superstar and therefore ours - 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.110
 we can adjust ourselves vogue 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.829
 we can regulate the passage of the video in which we want the Vatican 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.860
 and in any case if the second season 7 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.050
 not just sitting down to eat 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.580
 whatever has a set of commands that serve green set up for 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.660
 fix the pendants and our animations 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.290
 for now we have to say I would never have it in practice and already this bini 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.470
 overbooking has set 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.480
 a kind of that is a 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.180
 eh already established a more automatic fixation 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.820
 the iframes that is 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.060
 no need new photo d hotmail 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.960
 let's say and fix 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.020
 then with a special rate at the high position that the character will take on 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.320
 that frame 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.760
 so then what we can do we do an example 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.250
 so let's go 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.060
 sustain of 50 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.420
 ming example 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.270
 quis contra john 5 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.770
 wedge suffering hi5 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.090
 let's put something a person born character 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.230
 no we tweet here fixed rate is rough we go on poses 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.480
 the dream of the bride universal pronovias 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.800
 I put 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.040
 coop osa 5 people

 esp honda this window 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:18.130
 then I'll call the left button 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.389
 here instead nihon cmq no 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.449
 and that people sit down 

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.449
 or we can choose this example 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.509
 this too 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:36.819
 or this one 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.329
 however the hands can see that they are 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.900
 too many adherents pregnant and are and go into the jeans indeed in the case 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.949
 here are the nits can move the clerics 

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:50.129
 gold cup as usual by clicking on the hand with the left mouse button 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.579
 stremerx leave

 sa parameters 

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:58.549
 you know 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:02:59.789
 move 

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:01.709
 or in the arm 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.109
 wright frantic background 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:06.819
 croissant intersaj 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.879
 if there was an arm 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:13.450
 here is this precise craze so calf and strange character movements 

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:17.869
 the only thing we have the chalk removal done let's say we don't need to 

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:20.869
 set a key each time 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:26.129
 and we do it back to which it is suspended until naked breast we go back and the 

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.109
 time line 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:31.109
 and let's add a person bone if we hope run 

00:03:31.869 --> 00:03:34.869
 so now leaving it with the right mouse button 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.879
 no radio stress sir 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.459
 by clicking here we could 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.329
 to see 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.249
 the complete animation 

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:52.249
 I sell if I had it, you can see it very quickly 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:53.770
 then 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:56.679
 we should take it to 30 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:03:59.279
 present then what we must do 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:04.659
 let's go to 15 in a gondola. cerapositivo chose the thing of the passage 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.189
 we delete this friend 

00:04:08.189 --> 00:04:10.259
 and let's go here on the less 

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:11.860
 doge quick delete site 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.479
 keyframe 

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:16.519
 I call myself queries and well I go back to the initial position 

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:22.460
 at the court to the legendary character 30 there is the frame but h30 second task 30 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.070
 we always click the next we want to have it choose another we choose 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.070
 example is here a 190 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:36.529
 it is free now also this item to use this frame 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.749
 let's go back and the time-line dwarfs 

00:04:40.749 --> 00:04:42.249
 fanti we see that 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:45.249
 he then moves character 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:47.599
 take breil 

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:48.710
 hopefully 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.710
 paullo periphery of the animation 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.680
 youtube is alone 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.680
 mh this is a special action on verbs 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:01.839
 I can put 

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:05.240
 so let's go back to the kent my aunt the church in 30 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.009
 let's try this 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.960
 this sign this thing 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:10.999
 common - 

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:14.319
 then let's do two things the dead people go to the frame 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:17.650
 it is always 8 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.650
 we click this mouse company 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:26.419
 vanishing iam another 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.169
 we bring September 20 example 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.439
 conceri 5 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:36.389
 diamond hands are samaden of the body the thing we have to do or select water 

00:05:37.029 --> 00:05:41.740
 vat in the left arm lyrics for &amp; amp taken in right arm udine 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.189
 with water it costs on under water 

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:45.419
 body parts 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.610
 and we try wait for hear me 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.139
 concept of robert fisk 

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:52.270
 came text 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:54.139
 you know betsaida 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.139
 we have exposed 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.240
 cogena in the character 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:07.619
 now let's do this 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:11.180
 I don't know if I have a little arm 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.180
 nike shox air 

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:21.229
 so is a poke 

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:22.520
 that 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.749
 and therefore 

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:27.279
 so we have probably already turned on there is a frenet bone 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.270
 going down swallow gone in line 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.199
 we believe that 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.240
 to the fool at the extreme 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.240
 cooked in practice 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:43.569
 between saying and doing this thing, I will take that other thing 

00:06:45.119 --> 00:06:47.800
 like that 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.839
 this is because winx animation 

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:53.839
 same thing applies to the lamina such so on 

00:06:54.789 --> 00:06:57.240
 let's make 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.190
 we don't have to explain what we have to do in practice
