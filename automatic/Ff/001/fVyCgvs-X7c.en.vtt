it<00:02:07.450> hardens<00:02:08.170> a<00:02:08.470> little<00:02:08.830> bit<00:02:08.950> more<00:02:09.160> than<00:02:09.310> room

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
it hardens a little bit more than room

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:10.949 
it hardens a little bit more than room
temperature<00:02:09.520> but<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.209> just<00:02:10.420> need<00:02:10.599> half<00:02:10.780> a

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
temperature but I just need half a

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.059 
temperature but I just need half a
teaspoon<00:02:11.410> in<00:02:11.620> there

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
teaspoon in there

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.190 
teaspoon in there
and<00:02:12.219> then<00:02:12.849> finally<00:02:13.360> I<00:02:13.390> have<00:02:13.629> four<00:02:13.959> teaspoons

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200

bowl and as you can see now the
ingredients<00:02:25.870> are<00:02:26.079> sort<00:02:26.980> of<00:02:27.010> solid<00:02:27.519> with<00:02:27.790> that

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939

stainless<00:02:32.470> steel<00:02:32.950> bowl<00:02:33.310> over<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:35.280> saucepan

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
stainless steel bowl over a saucepan

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.309 
stainless steel bowl over a saucepan
that<00:02:36.909> has<00:02:37.150> a<00:02:37.359> little<00:02:37.750> bit<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:37.989> boiling<00:02:38.170> water

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
that has a little bit of boiling water

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.960 
that has a little bit of boiling water
about<00:02:38.859> a<00:02:38.889> couple<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.310> inches<00:02:39.459> of<00:02:39.760> boiling

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
about a couple of inches of boiling

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.589 
about a couple of inches of boiling
water<00:02:40.120> in<00:02:40.569> it<00:02:40.750> so<00:02:41.040> I'm<00:02:42.040> effectively<00:02:42.609> making<00:02:43.329> a

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:43.599 
water in it so I'm effectively making a

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.020 
water in it so I'm effectively making a
little<00:02:43.989> band<00:02:44.290> Marini<00:02:44.769> here<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.519> I'm<00:02:46.000> just

going<00:02:46.299> to<00:02:46.359> set<00:02:46.599> that<00:02:46.780> over<00:02:46.959> because<00:02:47.349> I<00:02:47.379> want

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
going to set that over because I want

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.069 
going to set that over because I want
the<00:02:47.920> oils<00:02:48.400> and<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:49.000> butters<00:02:49.299> just<00:02:49.599> to<00:02:49.750> melt

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:50.079 
the oils and the butters just to melt

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.360 
the oils and the butters just to melt
they're<00:02:50.439> not<00:02:50.560> going<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.769> boil<00:02:50.950> they're<00:02:51.250> not

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
they're not going to boil they're not

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.390
