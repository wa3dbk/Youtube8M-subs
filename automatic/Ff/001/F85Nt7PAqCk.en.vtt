 good morning good morning doctor how 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.390
 hello very good morning a short time ago 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.130
 I operated from the view and decided to share my 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.720
 experience with all of you if you are 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.730
 interested in knowing my experience os 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.610
 I recommend that you watch these videos where 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.280
 He explained everything that happened since the day 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.500
 prior to the first operation until a 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.120
 year after the theme 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.920
 this is the first in a series of 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:41.200
 videos where the doctor who operated for me 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.489
 Villalonga has offered to respond to 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.900
 all the questions that you ask us 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.670
 you have made arrive we have grouped the 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.350
 questions in several videos and os 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.900
 I recommend that you watch the videos in order 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.340
 we go there good morning doctor many 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.440
 Thanks for helping us clear the 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.379
 doubts from our viewers a few days 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.070
 thank you very much also for coming 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.500
 to my center to comment on the 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.269
 theme of refractive surgery a pleasure 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.740
 be with you already know if you are 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.540
 thinking operators of sight or 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.250
 you simply want to learn more about 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.630
 How the human eye os 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.690
 I recommend that you do not miss any of 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.790
 these doctor videos when you want 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.790
 we could start by describing how it is 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.800
 an eye that in what consists 

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:24.520
 what is the anatomy of the eye of the eye 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.930
 it's a very simple structure is a 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.510
 sphere 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:31.480
 that's why we call a balloon because of the way 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.190
 has is formed by a housing to the 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.770
 what we call sclera is this layer 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.530
 whitish that covers it on the outside and what 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:41.260
 protects protects all organs 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:45.760
 internal all internal tissues that 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:48.970
 they provide us with vision in the tissue 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:52.510
 most delicate of the eye is called retina is 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.820
 the lining that covers all the inside 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.509
 globe the whole sphere and it serves us to 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.540
 capture the images the images to be 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:05.399
 captured when captured by the 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:07.390
 photoreceptor system that we call are 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.970
 directed through the optic nerve 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.120
 towards the brain and that makes us 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:15.040
 aware that we see ourselves 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.959
 we really do not see with the eye we see with 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.959
 the brain thanks to the cells 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.850
 brain and the optic path 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:25.030
 we transmit the 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.010
 in light signals through the nerve 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.460
 optical and that's why we are aware of the 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:34.300
 vision so that this natural wonder 

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:36.670
 occur happens from the most 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.000
 basic since the protozoa already have 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:43.690
 eye systems to be able to direct 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.750
 in the darkness 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:48.730
 and light we have the optical system 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.740
 maybe more perfected of the 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:54.370
 nature and for this to happen 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:57.520
 we need an optical system that is 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.760
 able to capture from transmitting 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:04.470
 Focus the images from the outside 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:06.430
 to the bottom of the eye the optical system 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.420
 it's double 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:15.459
 consists of the cornea and the lens 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.530
 are two elements that blended 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.900
 they manage to focus the images in a 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:24.110
 sharp in the back of the eye is what 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:27.770
 we call macula the macula is the most 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:30.080
 sensitive of the center of the retina and with 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.410
 which we are able to discern the 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:35.470
 smaller objects 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.800
 to the cornea approximately provides the 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.320
 eye of about 43 45 diopters that together 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.350
 with the lens that adds another 20 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.240
 diop trias plus gives us a total of 60 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:51.090
 dioptries to be able to focus 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.090
 images 2 centimeters deep 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:58.010
 when any of these two of these 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:00.560
 two optical elements is insufficient or 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.830
 is too powerful is when we 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.640
 we find with the optical defects the 

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:08.819
 myopia astigmatism hyperopia 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.409
 etc 

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:12.180
 before you start talking about the effects 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.239
 optical I would like to do a review of 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:16.560
 the main parts of the human eye 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:18.269
 we have seen that the sclera is the 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.549
 wrapping that protects all 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.590
 internal tissues of the eye the retina 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.330
 covers the inside of the eye and is the 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.970
 sensor that captures images 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.699
 images of the exterior in the retina there 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.289
 a more sensitive area and called macula and 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:34.020
 thanks to the macula we are capable of 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:35.639
 perceive the smallest objects the 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.169
 information collected by the sensors of 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.900
 the retina circulated through the nerve 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.360
 optical to our brain where it 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.740
 process information on the other hand the 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:46.560
 optical system consists of the 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.210
 cornea and the lens the cornea is a 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.220
 element that behaves like a lens 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.169
 fixed and the lens is an organ 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.419
 internal that behaves like a lens 

00:04:52.169 --> 00:04:56.130
 variable is to say the crystalline 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:57.660
 deforms so that if we look at 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.880
 objects that are far away as objects that 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.370
 the resulting image is close to 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.259
 the retina is sharp the optical system 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.789
 is in charge of projecting and focusing 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:07.710
 the images of the exterior of form 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.009
 clear on the bottom of the eye on the 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.779
 taint 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.309
 going and is responsible for regulating the 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:14.379
 amount of light that enters since at 

00:05:12.309 --> 00:05:17.199
 dilate contracted modifies the size 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:18.669
 of the pupil that is the hole when 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:20.710
 we say that a person has eyes 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:22.629
 blue we're really referring to 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.900
 to the color of your iris to be correct 

00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:27.509
 we would have to say things like 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:29.639
 I love your blue beings you will notice 

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:31.169
 that in this image besides what 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:32.970
 we have talked today also appears in the 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:35.070
 anterior chamber and posterior chamber 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.479
 of the eye that will be very useful for us 

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:39.449
 when we talk about inserting contact lenses 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.280
 inside the eyes the anterior chamber is 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:43.289
 the space between the cornea and the 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.030
 anterior surface of the iris while 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.979
 that the rear camera is the space 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:50.060
 located between the rear margin of 

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.060
 iris to the lens 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.030
 for now this is all for today not you 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.830
 miss the next video where we are going to 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.870
 start talking about the optical effects 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.070
 thanks for giving me the like and if 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:03.870
 you want these videos can you 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.730
 interest to positions friends because not 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:08.030
 forget to share see you in the next 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.030
 videos 

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.280
 Hello, good morning, I'm Luis, recently. 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.050
 time hello good morning i'm luis ago 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.830
 little time I decided to have an eye operation 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.830
 Y 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.990
 Hello, good morning, I'm Luis, recently. 

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.790
 time that I had surgery and decided 

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:30.270
 short time ago I was operated on the 

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:31.920
 view and I decided I decided the cornea is a 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:36.050
 element that behaves like a lens 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.050
 set 15 minutes I started 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:41.300
 15 seconds
