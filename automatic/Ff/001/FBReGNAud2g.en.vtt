00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:01.720 
too harsh so it actually melts in really

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.350

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
thick enough whether it actually

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.830 
thick enough whether it actually
contrast<00:01:09.700> too<00:01:09.970> much<00:01:10.150> with<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.570> actual
