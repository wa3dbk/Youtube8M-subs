00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
all right second verse is played

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:05.180 
all right second verse is played
essentially<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.610> same<00:00:02.820> way<00:00:03.060> with<00:00:03.740> the<00:00:04.740> accent

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
essentially the same way with the accent

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.740 
essentially the same way with the accent
on<00:00:05.220> those<00:00:05.460> up<00:00:05.730> strokes<00:00:07.400> one<00:00:08.400> two<00:00:08.849> three<00:00:09.420> and

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
on those up strokes one two three and

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.480 
on those up strokes one two three and
one<00:00:15.920> stuff<00:00:16.920> like<00:00:17.070> that

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
one stuff like that

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.000 
one stuff like that
it's<00:00:17.720> slightly<00:00:18.720> different<00:00:19.199> so<00:00:19.800> I'm<00:00:19.890> gonna

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
it's slightly different so I'm gonna

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:21.349 
it's slightly different so I'm gonna
play<00:00:20.220> along<00:00:20.460> with<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:20.670> track<00:00:20.699> now<00:00:21.119> and<00:00:21.150> then

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
play along with the track now and then

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:48.630 
play along with the track now and then
I'll<00:00:21.449> show<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.630> what<00:00:21.750> he<00:00:21.930> does

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.950 

I'm<00:00:49.640> in<00:00:49.789> the<00:00:49.850> second<00:00:50.269> verse<00:00:50.390> instead<00:00:50.749> of<00:00:50.839> just

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
I'm in the second verse instead of just

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.139 
I'm in the second verse instead of just
doing<00:00:51.230> that<00:00:51.350> on<00:00:53.409> the<00:00:54.409> open<00:00:54.530> string<00:00:55.100> it<00:00:55.909> sounds

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
doing that on the open string it sounds

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:58.779 
doing that on the open string it sounds
a<00:00:56.239> little<00:00:56.390> like<00:00:56.600> he's<00:00:56.809> fretting<00:00:57.289> the<00:00:58.280> top<00:00:58.519> part

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
a little like he's fretting the top part

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:00.099 
a little like he's fretting the top part
of<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.940> E<00:00:58.969> chord<00:00:59.299> so<00:00:59.539> you<00:00:59.600> can<00:00:59.780> do<00:00:59.929> that

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
of the E chord so you can do that

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:06.910 
of the E chord so you can do that
instead<00:01:04.390> they're<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:05.720> similar<00:01:06.380> but<00:01:06.590> if<00:01:06.799> you

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
instead they're so similar but if you

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.010 
instead they're so similar but if you
listen<00:01:07.220> closely<00:01:07.430> you<00:01:07.729> can<00:01:08.509> hear<00:01:08.570> the<00:01:08.810> G<00:01:08.990> sharp

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
listen closely you can hear the G sharp

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:16.450 
listen closely you can hear the G sharp
in<00:01:09.470> there<00:01:14.470> and<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.710> different<00:01:15.830> series<00:01:16.310> he

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
in there and the different series he

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.399 
in there and the different series he
just<00:01:16.670> keeps<00:01:16.880> tearing<00:01:17.149> that<00:01:17.420> through<00:01:18.140> almost

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
just keeps tearing that through almost

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:29.199 
just keeps tearing that through almost
the<00:01:18.500> entire<00:01:18.830> first<00:01:18.860> four<00:01:19.429> bars<00:01:27.880> so<00:01:28.880> at<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.090> end

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:29.209 
the entire first four bars so at the end

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:32.949 
the entire first four bars so at the end
they're<00:01:30.250> the<00:01:31.250> third<00:01:31.880> fret<00:01:32.179> fourth<00:01:32.509> fret<00:01:32.659> they

00:01:32.949 --> 00:01:32.959 
they're the third fret fourth fret they

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:35.350 
they're the third fret fourth fret they
get<00:01:33.110> into<00:01:33.289> the<00:01:33.409> a<00:01:33.440> chord<00:01:33.860> but<00:01:34.549> he<00:01:34.729> goes<00:01:34.940> right

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
get into the a chord but he goes right

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.889 
get into the a chord but he goes right
to<00:01:39.880> so<00:01:40.880> it's<00:01:41.030> funny<00:01:41.209> it<00:01:41.360> almost<00:01:41.539> sounds<00:01:41.810> like

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
to so it's funny it almost sounds like

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.630 
to so it's funny it almost sounds like
it<00:01:42.020> could<00:01:42.200> be<00:01:42.229> a<00:01:42.380> mistake<00:01:42.830> it's<00:01:43.100> a<00:01:43.159> little

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
it could be a mistake it's a little

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:46.289 
it could be a mistake it's a little
silly<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:44.209> he<00:01:44.299> goes<00:01:44.450> back<00:01:44.690> to<00:01:45.409> the<00:01:45.530> ER<00:01:45.770> early

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:46.299 
silly and he goes back to the ER early

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:48.910 
silly and he goes back to the ER early
mistake<00:01:47.299> or<00:01:47.479> not<00:01:47.509> it<00:01:47.780> sounds<00:01:48.110> great<00:01:48.439> it's<00:01:48.709> a

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
mistake or not it sounds great it's a

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.570 
mistake or not it sounds great it's a
cool<00:01:49.159> way<00:01:49.189> to<00:01:49.399> do<00:01:49.640> it

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:56.580 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.650 

and<00:01:57.770> then<00:01:58.770> he<00:01:58.860> changes<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.430> riff<00:01:59.640> here<00:02:00.000> in<00:02:00.180> bar

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
and then he changes the riff here in bar

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:12.350 
and then he changes the riff here in bar
Aid<00:02:05.300> are<00:02:06.300> you<00:02:06.360> going<00:02:06.630> back<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:06.930> forth<00:02:11.360> got

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
your record lay that ring finger down

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.480 
your record lay that ring finger down
across<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.620> D<00:02:17.010> G<00:02:17.250> and<00:02:17.280> B<00:02:17.430> string<00:02:22.040> you<00:02:23.040> got<00:02:23.160> damn

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
across the D G and B string you got damn

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.400 
across the D G and B string you got damn
strong<00:02:23.940> and<00:02:24.240> upstroke<00:02:24.810> on<00:02:24.960> the<00:02:25.050> low<00:02:25.200> E<00:02:25.230> string

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
strong and upstroke on the low E string

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:34.260 
strong and upstroke on the low E string
and<00:02:25.830> then<00:02:25.920> it<00:02:26.120> so<00:02:27.120> those<00:02:27.300> up<00:02:27.540> strokes

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.630 

you<00:02:35.140> can<00:02:35.290> do<00:02:35.410> them<00:02:35.530> on<00:02:35.680> the<00:02:35.800> low<00:02:35.950> e-string<00:02:36.190> as<00:02:36.610> a

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
you can do them on the low e-string as a

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.610 
you can do them on the low e-string as a
way<00:02:36.850> to<00:02:37.350> propel<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.530> rhythm

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.979 

it's<00:02:42.519> also<00:02:42.670> nice<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.150> alternate<00:02:43.629> between<00:02:43.750> the

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
it's also nice to alternate between the

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:44.850 
it's also nice to alternate between the
low<00:02:44.290> sound

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
low sound

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.990 
low sound
and<00:02:44.980> then<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.250> higher<00:02:45.430> sound<00:02:45.760> for<00:02:45.910> the

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
and then the higher sound for the

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:52.040 
and then the higher sound for the
accidents

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:59.740 

go<00:02:53.040> back<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.430> forth<00:02:53.670> like<00:02:53.730> that

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.090 

if<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.870> want<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.320> start<00:03:01.620> by<00:03:01.740> hitting<00:03:01.890> a

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
if you want you can start by hitting a

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.140 
if you want you can start by hitting a
full<00:03:02.280> b5<00:03:02.730> bar<00:03:03.030> chord<00:03:04.670> before<00:03:05.670> going<00:03:05.850> into<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
full b5 bar chord before going into the

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:16.360 
full b5 bar chord before going into the
bass<00:03:06.390> riff<00:03:10.340> this<00:03:11.340> is<00:03:11.520> kind<00:03:11.730> of<00:03:11.820> neat<00:03:11.970> here

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.390 

at<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.520> end<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:18.350> bar<00:03:19.350> 10<00:03:21.860> that's<00:03:22.860> bar<00:03:23.130> 10<00:03:23.340> to
