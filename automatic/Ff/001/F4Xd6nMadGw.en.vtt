00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.610

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.190
 no to the map it was put if type of lc 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.650

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.580

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:22.780

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.600
 they are going to put things much more pros look 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:27.729
 here and here you are seeing which craft to 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.950
 see to see what more than more you're going to 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.960
 arcade we are going to have many mini-games 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.380

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.350

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.689
 this reproach with the dj is put with 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.270

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:46.840

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:49.079

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.369
 you wrote you study I want to play this 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.490
 large particles here is with the 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:56.490
 administrator the disco the party 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.350
 special 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:14.350
 and well here I am with the administrator 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.340
 here that he let me in with permission 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:21.480
 now of all 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.480
 He did not tell me either, I 'm going to show you the 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.380
 beautiful 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.920
 and now I do have my youtuber range no longer 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.770
 I am a moderator many did not see with 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.620
 moderator was because he was going to have 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.030
 Youtuber rank but with powers of mania 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.850
 software habit the powers with 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.690
 bathing permits and all that but never 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:51.910
 they gave me that range but now I do 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.470
 I already have only youtube because I do not like it 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.880
 To be a moderator 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.710
 It is good to solve doubts of the 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.270
 users telling me that he hears when he opens 

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.640
 this hears because since it is handled and 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.410
 guanacevÃ­ that is fine is not well 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.200
 but I got ready 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.450
 I am more youtuber of the server than someone 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.099
 someone like that more involved with the staff and 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.769
 that I do not know about commands or anything like that 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.680
 and I did not help in the server good help 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:18.129
 promoting but nothing more 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:20.230
 then limbo craft this server is 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:22.090
 which is the best server that can be 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.730
 since you drop them I do not know if they have 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.120
 modified not saying they have 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.680
 multiplied yes 1.8 is 1.8 because there 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.859
 people who are with the 17 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:37.670
 there are people who enter with the 17 but it is already 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:40.400
 this is going to be 1.8 definitely 1.8 and 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.770
 the truth without more is therefore better than 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.620
 best 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:48.130
 why why why then I already like that 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:51.670
 already going to go to 11.9 I do not know if I already 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:55.260
 they knew and well it's better that I go to 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.260
 server advancing that is not left behind 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.920
 but I already think that I'm going to finish 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:04.380
 see I want I want before I do not know if 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.380

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.060

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:14.560
