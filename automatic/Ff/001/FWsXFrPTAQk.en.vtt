playstation home screen it'll take you
back<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.250> home<00:01:44.399> screen<00:01:44.430> now<00:01:45.920> when<00:01:46.920> you're

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
back to the home screen now when you're

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.620 
back to the home screen now when you're
using<00:01:47.280> this<00:01:47.549> you'll<00:01:47.790> probably<00:01:48.000> notice<00:01:48.329> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
using this you'll probably notice that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.090 
using this you'll probably notice that
you're<00:01:48.720> going<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.869> see<00:01:49.020> PlayStation<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.829> lot

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
you're going to see PlayStation a lot

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.130 
you're going to see PlayStation a lot
and<00:01:50.310> that<00:01:50.549> does<00:01:50.790> get<00:01:51.060> reasonably<00:01:51.570> frustrating

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
and that does get reasonably frustrating

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.690 
and that does get reasonably frustrating
so<00:01:52.350> what<00:01:52.890> they've<00:01:53.070> done<00:01:53.100> is<00:01:53.280> they've<00:01:53.520> actually

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
so what they've done is they've actually

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.910 
so what they've done is they've actually
made<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.299> LT<00:01:54.689> trigger<00:01:55.140> arm<00:01:55.380> something<00:01:55.680> to

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
made the LT trigger arm something to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.410 
made the LT trigger arm something to
activate<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.549> voice<00:01:56.790> command<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.329> you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
activate that voice command so if you

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.240 
activate that voice command so if you
press<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.630> once<00:01:57.869> little<00:01:58.590> command<00:01:58.829> comes<00:01:59.070> up

the<00:02:29.330> home<00:02:29.510> screen<00:02:30.700> it<00:02:31.700> seems<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.270> the<00:02:32.450> actual

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
the home screen it seems that the actual

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.600 
the home screen it seems that the actual
microphone<00:02:33.620> on<00:02:33.770> the<00:02:33.800> camera<00:02:34.190> doesn't<00:02:34.370> really

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
microphone on the camera doesn't really

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.610 
microphone on the camera doesn't really
register<00:02:35.210> audio<00:02:35.540> too<00:02:35.630> quickly<00:02:36.080> so<00:02:36.350> it<00:02:36.470> almost

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
register audio too quickly so it almost

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.380 
register audio too quickly so it almost
seems<00:02:36.950> like<00:02:37.040> there's<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.400> delay<00:02:37.760> between<00:02:37.820> you

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
seems like there's a delay between you

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:40.270 
seems like there's a delay between you
saying<00:02:38.660> it<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:38.990> the<00:02:39.410> PlayStation<00:02:39.950> reading

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
saying it and the PlayStation reading

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.590 
saying it and the PlayStation reading
what<00:02:40.400> you've<00:02:40.520> said<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:41.000> it's<00:02:41.150> obviously<00:02:41.450> it

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
what you've said so it's obviously it

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.880 
what you've said so it's obviously it
obviously<00:02:41.840> takes<00:02:41.930> a<00:02:42.170> while<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.440> analyze

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
obviously takes a while to analyze

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.610 
obviously takes a while to analyze
exactly<00:02:43.280> what<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.640> said<00:02:43.880> and<00:02:44.500> process<00:02:45.500> it

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
exactly what you said and process it

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.310 
exactly what you said and process it
through<00:02:45.770> the<00:02:45.890> PlayStation<00:02:47.080> but<00:02:48.080> as<00:02:48.170> you<00:02:48.230> can

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:48.320 
through the PlayStation but as you can

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.410 
through the PlayStation but as you can
see<00:02:48.500> it<00:02:48.620> does<00:02:48.800> work<00:02:49.340> reasonably<00:02:49.880> well<00:02:49.970> I'm<00:02:50.390> a

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420 
see it does work reasonably well I'm a

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.970 
see it does work reasonably well I'm a
few<00:02:50.930> tweaks<00:02:51.200> I'm<00:02:51.410> sure<00:02:51.590> they'll<00:02:51.770> actually

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
few tweaks I'm sure they'll actually

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.910 
few tweaks I'm sure they'll actually
update<00:02:52.580> I<00:02:52.820> guess<00:02:53.330> how<00:02:53.930> well<00:02:54.200> the<00:02:54.530> whole<00:02:54.680> thing

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
update I guess how well the whole thing

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.680 
update I guess how well the whole thing
recognizes<00:02:55.520> your<00:02:55.610> voice<00:02:55.670> and<00:02:55.880> different

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
recognizes your voice and different

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.450 
recognizes your voice and different
functionality<00:02:57.320> and<00:02:57.440> how<00:02:57.590> far<00:02:57.890> through<00:02:58.340> the

00:02:58.450 --> 00:02:58.460 
functionality and how far through the

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.070 
functionality and how far through the
PlayStation<00:02:59.030> you<00:02:59.090> can<00:02:59.210> use<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.540> there's<00:02:59.960> no

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
PlayStation you can use it there's no

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.870 
PlayStation you can use it there's no
functionality<00:03:00.590> up<00:03:00.890> in<00:03:01.010> this<00:03:01.160> bar<00:03:01.400> so<00:03:01.640> there's

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880 
functionality up in this bar so there's

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.430 
functionality up in this bar so there's
really<00:03:02.090> not<00:03:02.360> too<00:03:02.420> much<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:02.840> can<00:03:02.960> do<00:03:03.080> on<00:03:03.230> here

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440
