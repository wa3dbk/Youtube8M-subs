00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
everybody that's all I'm gonna say about

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.500 
everybody that's all I'm gonna say about
that<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.670> don't<00:00:56.760> really<00:00:56.910> want<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.180> get<00:00:57.239> into<00:00:57.420> it

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
that I don't really want to get into it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.459 
that I don't really want to get into it
but<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:58.109> is<00:00:58.289> why<00:00:58.850> restrictions<00:00:59.850> are<00:00:59.969> needed

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469

through the roof so yeah um I didn't

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.950 
through the roof so yeah um I didn't
know<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.970> when<00:01:48.149> I<00:01:48.210> started<00:01:48.479> this<00:01:48.600> battle

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
know that when I started this battle

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.210 
know that when I started this battle
because<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.229> had<00:01:49.320> never<00:01:49.470> seen<00:01:49.710> something<00:01:50.100> so

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
because I had never seen something so

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.350

power of flinching Togekiss which is
also<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> little<00:01:56.820> bit<00:01:56.909> cheap<00:01:57.149> as<00:01:57.299> well<00:01:57.570> but<00:01:58.469> I

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
also a little bit cheap as well but I

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.969 
also a little bit cheap as well but I
mean<00:01:59.310> I'm<00:02:00.210> doing<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.600> it's<00:02:01.020> not<00:02:01.229> game<00:02:01.950> breaking
