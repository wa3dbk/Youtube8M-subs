side<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.460> her<00:01:23.520> face<00:01:23.580> cuz<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.240> kind<00:01:24.450> of<00:01:24.540> looks

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
side of her face cuz it kind of looks

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.200

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.910 
like it's melting off because of that
design<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.900> don't<00:01:28.350> know<00:01:28.439> why<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.619> would

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
design I don't know why you would

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.950 
design I don't know why you would
imprint<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.340> doll's<00:01:29.549> face<00:01:29.640> with<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.390> design<00:01:30.750> but

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
imprint a doll's face with a design but

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.719 
imprint a doll's face with a design but
other<00:01:31.200> than<00:01:31.320> that<00:01:31.380> she's<00:01:32.189> really<00:01:32.400> pretty<00:01:32.579> and

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
other than that she's really pretty and

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.300 
other than that she's really pretty and
her<00:01:33.000> detailed<00:01:33.450> and<00:01:33.829> liked<00:01:34.829> her<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> lot

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
her detailed and liked her a lot

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.249 
her detailed and liked her a lot
so<00:01:35.880> Monster<00:01:36.119> High<00:01:36.240> dolls<00:01:36.420> are<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:36.780> overpriced

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
so Monster High dolls are so overpriced

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.569 
so Monster High dolls are so overpriced
though<00:01:37.500> which<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.710> probably<00:01:38.130> why<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.369> took

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
though which is probably why it took

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.090 
though which is probably why it took
them<00:01:38.700> so<00:01:38.759> long<00:01:38.880> to<00:01:39.090> buy<00:01:39.390> any<00:01:39.659> she<00:01:40.560> was<00:01:40.680> twenty

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
them so long to buy any she was twenty

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.520 
them so long to buy any she was twenty
five<00:01:41.280> dollars<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:42.299> her<00:01:42.450> only<00:01:42.689> accessory<00:01:43.140> is

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
five dollars and her only accessory is

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.280
