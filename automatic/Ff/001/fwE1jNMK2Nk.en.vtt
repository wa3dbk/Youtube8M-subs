00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:18.190 

all<00:00:16.430> right<00:00:16.580> so<00:00:16.790> after<00:00:17.060> we<00:00:17.210> take<00:00:17.539> the<00:00:17.930> heart

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:18.200 
all right so after we take the heart

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.810 
all right so after we take the heart
rate<00:00:18.350> heart<00:00:18.770> rate<00:00:18.890> we<00:00:19.130> move<00:00:19.340> on<00:00:19.460> to<00:00:19.610> blood

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:19.820 
rate heart rate we move on to blood

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.480 
rate heart rate we move on to blood
pressure<00:00:19.850> and<00:00:20.390> so<00:00:21.140> there's<00:00:21.560> some<00:00:21.860> equipment

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
pressure and so there's some equipment

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.999 
pressure and so there's some equipment
that<00:00:22.520> you<00:00:22.670> need<00:00:23.000> to<00:00:23.119> help<00:00:23.330> prepared<00:00:23.720> for<00:00:23.900> this

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:27.009 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:29.710 

this<00:00:28.009> is<00:00:28.070> the<00:00:28.369> blood<00:00:28.550> pressure<00:00:28.759> cusp<00:00:29.119> and<00:00:29.450> so

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:29.720 
this is the blood pressure cusp and so

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:32.350 
this is the blood pressure cusp and so
this<00:00:30.199> whole<00:00:30.410> block<00:00:31.220> velcro<00:00:31.730> thing<00:00:32.000> is<00:00:32.150> what

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:32.360 
this whole block velcro thing is what

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.259 
this whole block velcro thing is what
you<00:00:32.510> wrap<00:00:32.809> around<00:00:32.840> the<00:00:33.230> patient's<00:00:33.620> arm<00:00:33.830> and

00:00:34.259 --> 00:00:34.269 
you wrap around the patient's arm and

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:38.320 
you wrap around the patient's arm and
you<00:00:35.269> have<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:35.780> pump<00:00:35.989> right<00:00:36.199> here<00:00:36.400> which<00:00:37.400> I'll

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:38.330 
you have the pump right here which I'll

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.299 
you have the pump right here which I'll
out<00:00:38.570> which<00:00:38.870> you<00:00:38.989> pump<00:00:39.230> up<00:00:39.379> to<00:00:39.440> put<00:00:39.800> air<00:00:39.980> in<00:00:40.100> here

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
out which you pump up to put air in here

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:41.920 
out which you pump up to put air in here
and<00:00:40.430> that's<00:00:40.550> what<00:00:40.699> gets<00:00:40.850> a<00:00:41.000> tight<00:00:41.780> around

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
and that's what gets a tight around

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.680 
and that's what gets a tight around
their<00:00:42.140> arm<00:00:42.320> and<00:00:42.590> so<00:00:43.430> before<00:00:43.670> you<00:00:43.850> begin<00:00:44.000> you

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
their arm and so before you begin you

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.479 
their arm and so before you begin you
got<00:00:44.809> to<00:00:44.900> make<00:00:44.989> sure<00:00:45.199> this<00:00:45.470> is<00:00:45.710> twisted<00:00:46.129> all<00:00:46.339> the

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
got to make sure this is twisted all the

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:47.950 
got to make sure this is twisted all the
way<00:00:46.580> to<00:00:46.640> the<00:00:46.820> right<00:00:47.089> righty-tighty

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
way to the right righty-tighty

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.689 
way to the right righty-tighty
lefty-loosey<00:00:48.830> so<00:00:49.040> when<00:00:49.159> you<00:00:49.220> have<00:00:49.339> it<00:00:49.370> all<00:00:49.580> the

00:00:49.689 --> 00:00:49.699 
lefty-loosey so when you have it all the

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:51.549 
lefty-loosey so when you have it all the
way<00:00:49.790> to<00:00:49.820> the<00:00:50.030> right<00:00:50.210> that's<00:00:50.870> how<00:00:51.049> you<00:00:51.110> close<00:00:51.379> it

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
way to the right that's how you close it

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:53.350 
way to the right that's how you close it
off<00:00:51.680> so<00:00:51.920> that<00:00:51.949> air<00:00:52.309> actually<00:00:52.760> pumps<00:00:53.059> it<00:00:53.180> into

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
off so that air actually pumps it into

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.360 
off so that air actually pumps it into
here<00:00:53.629> otherwise<00:00:54.320> you'll<00:00:54.559> keep<00:00:54.739> squeezing<00:00:55.070> and

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
here otherwise you'll keep squeezing and

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.939 
here otherwise you'll keep squeezing and
nothing<00:00:55.610> will<00:00:55.729> be<00:00:55.760> happening<00:00:56.350> the<00:00:57.350> meter<00:00:57.589> so

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
nothing will be happening the meter so

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.680 
nothing will be happening the meter so
when<00:00:58.549> you<00:00:58.640> pump<00:00:58.820> it<00:00:58.940> up<00:00:59.089> you<00:00:59.299> can<00:00:59.479> gauge<00:00:59.659> how

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
when you pump it up you can gauge how

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.259 
when you pump it up you can gauge how
much<00:00:59.960> air<00:01:00.229> you<00:01:00.260> have<00:01:00.530> in<00:01:00.739> by<00:01:01.040> how<00:01:01.940> high<00:01:02.210> the

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:02.269 
much air you have in by how high the

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.280 
much air you have in by how high the
numbers<00:01:02.989> are<00:01:03.170> and<00:01:04.210> you<00:01:05.210> listen<00:01:05.600> for<00:01:05.869> the

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
numbers are and you listen for the

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.580 
numbers are and you listen for the
pulses<00:01:07.159> with<00:01:07.820> the<00:01:07.970> stethoscope<00:01:08.240> hope<00:01:09.140> when

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
pulses with the stethoscope hope when

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:11.649 
pulses with the stethoscope hope when
you<00:01:09.680> put<00:01:09.860> it<00:01:09.979> in<00:01:10.070> your<00:01:10.100> ears<00:01:10.430> make<00:01:10.970> sure<00:01:11.270> that

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
you put it in your ears make sure that

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:13.630 
you put it in your ears make sure that
these<00:01:11.900> prongs<00:01:12.229> are<00:01:12.439> facing<00:01:12.830> forward<00:01:13.130> not

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
these prongs are facing forward not

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.609 
these prongs are facing forward not
backwards<00:01:14.229> even<00:01:15.229> though<00:01:15.320> that's<00:01:15.380> what<00:01:15.560> you

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
backwards even though that's what you

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.080 
backwards even though that's what you
think<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:15.890> should<00:01:16.040> be<00:01:16.070> you<00:01:16.340> face<00:01:16.549> it<00:01:16.700> forward

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
think it should be you face it forward

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:21.060 
think it should be you face it forward
and<00:01:18.010> double-check<00:01:19.010> to<00:01:19.220> make<00:01:19.250> sure<00:01:19.400> it's<00:01:19.730> on<00:01:20.020> by

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
and double-check to make sure it's on by

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.740 
and double-check to make sure it's on by
twisting<00:01:22.070> you<00:01:22.430> can<00:01:22.580> twist<00:01:22.760> this<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.270> tap<00:01:23.540> on

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
twisting you can twist this and tap on

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.940 
twisting you can twist this and tap on
it<00:01:24.130> so<00:01:25.130> you<00:01:25.300> hear<00:01:26.440> right<00:01:27.440> now<00:01:27.620> it's<00:01:27.770> not<00:01:27.890> really

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
it so you hear right now it's not really

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.190 
it so you hear right now it's not really
making<00:01:28.280> a<00:01:28.520> noise<00:01:28.910> in<00:01:29.150> my<00:01:29.180> ear<00:01:29.300> but<00:01:30.050> when<00:01:30.170> I

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.200 
making a noise in my ear but when I

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.890 
making a noise in my ear but when I
twist<00:01:30.560> it<00:01:31.090> then<00:01:32.090> I<00:01:32.210> can<00:01:32.390> hear<00:01:32.540> it<00:01:32.660> and<00:01:32.810> so

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:32.900 
twist it then I can hear it and so

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.960 
twist it then I can hear it and so
that's<00:01:33.380> how<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:33.590> know<00:01:33.800> if<00:01:34.280> your<00:01:34.760> stethoscope

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
that's how you know if your stethoscope

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.120 
that's how you know if your stethoscope
is<00:01:35.480> on<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:35.960> working<00:01:36.110> otherwise<00:01:36.650> you<00:01:36.830> might<00:01:37.010> be

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
is on and working otherwise you might be

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.350 
is on and working otherwise you might be
sitting<00:01:37.310> there<00:01:37.610> and<00:01:37.820> be<00:01:38.000> thinking<00:01:38.270> this

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
sitting there and be thinking this

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.540 
sitting there and be thinking this
person<00:01:38.750> has<00:01:38.900> no<00:01:39.110> pulse<00:01:39.350> when<00:01:40.160> really<00:01:40.340> your

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
person has no pulse when really your

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.720 
person has no pulse when really your
stethoscope<00:01:40.730> is<00:01:41.300> just<00:01:41.510> turned<00:01:42.200> off<00:01:42.320> and<00:01:42.980> then

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:43.730 
stethoscope is just turned off and then

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.670 
stethoscope is just turned off and then
you<00:01:43.790> have<00:01:43.909> the<00:01:44.240> patient<00:01:44.720> put<00:01:44.900> their<00:01:45.020> right<00:01:45.440> arm

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
you have the patient put their right arm

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.350 
you have the patient put their right arm
up<00:01:45.860> on<00:01:46.010> the<00:01:46.100> table<00:01:46.430> and<00:01:46.610> we<00:01:46.760> use<00:01:46.880> the<00:01:47.000> right<00:01:47.180> arm

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:47.360 
up on the table and we use the right arm

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.180 
up on the table and we use the right arm
just<00:01:47.600> for<00:01:47.720> consistency<00:01:47.870> throughout<00:01:48.860> all<00:01:49.040> the

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:49.190 
just for consistency throughout all the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.610 
just for consistency throughout all the
tests<00:01:49.720> so<00:01:50.720> what<00:01:50.870> you're<00:01:50.960> going<00:01:51.080> to<00:01:51.110> do<00:01:51.290> is

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
tests so what you're going to do is

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.140 
tests so what you're going to do is
you're<00:01:51.740> going<00:01:51.770> to<00:01:51.890> try<00:01:52.100> to<00:01:52.190> see<00:01:52.790> if<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.000> can

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:53.150 
you're going to try to see if you can

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.130 
you're going to try to see if you can
find<00:01:53.360> a<00:01:53.450> pulse<00:01:53.840> on<00:01:54.230> the<00:01:54.920> brachial<00:01:55.220> artery<00:01:56.140> it's

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
find a pulse on the brachial artery it's

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.570 
find a pulse on the brachial artery it's
usually<00:01:57.380> towards<00:01:57.800> the<00:01:57.890> inside<00:01:58.190> of<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.370> elbow

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
usually towards the inside of the elbow

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.600 
usually towards the inside of the elbow
around<00:01:59.180> here

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.440 

and<00:02:02.610> you<00:02:02.759> kind<00:02:02.939> of<00:02:02.969> just<00:02:03.030> take<00:02:03.149> a<00:02:03.270> little

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
and you kind of just take a little

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.010 
and you kind of just take a little
mental<00:02:03.810> note<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.520> and<00:02:05.520> you're<00:02:05.670> gonna

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
mental note of that and you're gonna

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.130 
mental note of that and you're gonna
wrap<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.200> cusp<00:02:07.469> around<00:02:07.860> their<00:02:07.979> arm<00:02:08.929> keep<00:02:09.929> it

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
wrap the cusp around their arm keep it

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.070 
wrap the cusp around their arm keep it
snug<00:02:10.950> but<00:02:11.340> not<00:02:11.489> super<00:02:11.940> tight<00:02:12.120> you<00:02:12.750> just<00:02:12.780> don't

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
snug but not super tight you just don't

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.050 
snug but not super tight you just don't
want<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.290> to<00:02:13.410> have<00:02:13.560> it<00:02:13.769> loose<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.310> wobbling

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
want it to have it loose and wobbling

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.290 
want it to have it loose and wobbling
around<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:16.410> you<00:02:16.470> put<00:02:16.680> these<00:02:16.830> in<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.400> put<00:02:18.269> the

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
around so you put these in and put the

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.180 
around so you put these in and put the
head<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.810> skip<00:02:19.050> stethoscope<00:02:19.739> right<00:02:19.950> where

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
head of the skip stethoscope right where

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.770 
head of the skip stethoscope right where
you<00:02:20.310> had<00:02:20.519> but<00:02:20.930> pulse<00:02:23.180> and<00:02:24.180> double<00:02:24.480> check<00:02:24.660> to

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
you had but pulse and double check to

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.589 
you had but pulse and double check to
make<00:02:24.870> sure<00:02:24.930> this<00:02:25.200> is<00:02:25.380> all<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.650> way<00:02:25.769> tight<00:02:26.130> and

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
make sure this is all the way tight and

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:30.350 
make sure this is all the way tight and
you're<00:02:27.599> going<00:02:27.750> to<00:02:27.780> squeeze<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.700> I<00:02:30.060> doing<00:02:30.269> this

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
you're going to squeeze and I doing this

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.780 
you're going to squeeze and I doing this
you<00:02:30.510> pump<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.930> air<00:02:31.110> into<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.799> cusps<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.700> I'm

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
you pump the air into the cusps so I'm

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.250 
you pump the air into the cusps so I'm
going<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.030> pump<00:02:36.239> it<00:02:36.330> up<00:02:36.510> again<00:02:36.780> just<00:02:36.810> so<00:02:37.200> you

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
going to pump it up again just so you

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.710 
going to pump it up again just so you
can<00:02:37.470> see<00:02:37.709> in<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.459> camera<00:02:38.670> what's<00:02:39.000> going<00:02:39.239> on<00:02:41.720> so

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
can see in the camera what's going on so

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.089 
can see in the camera what's going on so
we<00:02:42.870> have<00:02:42.989> it<00:02:43.110> up<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.260> about<00:02:43.470> 200<00:02:43.769> and<00:02:44.400> then<00:02:46.099> we

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
we have it up to about 200 and then we

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:54.289 
we have it up to about 200 and then we
slowly<00:02:47.400> let<00:02:47.760> some<00:02:48.000> air<00:02:48.150> out<00:02:51.290> and<00:02:53.180> that's<00:02:54.180> where

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
slowly let some air out and that's where

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.300 
slowly let some air out and that's where
I<00:02:54.360> heard<00:02:54.480> my<00:02:54.660> first<00:02:54.959> thumb<00:02:55.260> and<00:02:55.530> you<00:02:56.010> can<00:02:56.130> see

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
I heard my first thumb and you can see

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:59.170 
I heard my first thumb and you can see
the<00:02:56.459> dial<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.970> was<00:02:57.209> he<00:02:57.299> knock<00:02:57.450> him<00:02:57.599> down<00:02:57.750> and

00:02:59.170 --> 00:02:59.180 
the dial that was he knock him down and

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.949 
the dial that was he knock him down and
the<00:03:00.180> last<00:03:00.390> month<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:00.750> heard<00:03:00.959> was<00:03:01.290> about<00:03:01.910> 64<00:03:02.930> so<00:03:03.930> I

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
the last month I heard was about 64 so I

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.979 
the last month I heard was about 64 so I
got<00:03:04.170> about<00:03:04.349> 118<00:03:05.069> over<00:03:05.489> 64<00:03:06.090> because<00:03:06.870> that's

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
got about 118 over 64 because that's

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.110 
got about 118 over 64 because that's
where<00:03:07.139> I<00:03:07.200> heard<00:03:07.350> my<00:03:07.500> first<00:03:07.709> thump<00:03:08.100> walk<00:03:08.519> heard

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
where I heard my first thump walk heard

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.180 
where I heard my first thump walk heard
more<00:03:09.389> watch<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.230> dial<00:03:10.380> bounce<00:03:10.680> up<00:03:10.950> and<00:03:11.069> down

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
more watch the dial bounce up and down

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.670 
more watch the dial bounce up and down
and<00:03:11.639> about<00:03:12.150> 64<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:13.019> didn't<00:03:13.380> hear<00:03:13.500> anything

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
and about 64 I didn't hear anything

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.590 
and about 64 I didn't hear anything
anymore<00:03:14.010> but<00:03:14.850> essentially<00:03:15.359> what<00:03:15.510> you're

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
anymore but essentially what you're

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.660 
anymore but essentially what you're
looking<00:03:15.900> for<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.410> when<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.680> release<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.370> air

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
looking for is when you release the air

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.879 
looking for is when you release the air
you'll<00:03:18.359> see<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.660> dial<00:03:18.870> go<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.530> you'll<00:03:19.709> begin

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
you'll see the dial go and you'll begin

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:23.509 
you'll see the dial go and you'll begin
to<00:03:20.069> hear<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.760> thumps<00:03:21.389> usually<00:03:21.989> around<00:03:22.519> 120

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
to hear a thumps usually around 120

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:25.220 
to hear a thumps usually around 120
that's<00:03:23.970> just<00:03:24.239> kind<00:03:24.420> of<00:03:24.480> an<00:03:24.600> average<00:03:24.750> some

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
that's just kind of an average some

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.449 
that's just kind of an average some
people<00:03:25.440> might<00:03:25.590> be<00:03:25.620> a<00:03:25.709> little<00:03:25.920> higher<00:03:26.069> a<00:03:26.100> lot<00:03:26.370> of

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
people might be a little higher a lot of

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.640 
people might be a little higher a lot of
people<00:03:26.700> are<00:03:26.819> lower<00:03:27.030> than<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.840> what

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
people are lower than that and what

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.440 
people are lower than that and what
you're<00:03:28.769> hearing<00:03:29.069> here<00:03:29.430> is<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.880> first<00:03:30.090> thump

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
you're hearing here is the first thump

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.080 
you're hearing here is the first thump
is<00:03:30.690> their<00:03:31.380> systolic<00:03:32.160> pressure<00:03:32.549> so<00:03:32.880> that's

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
is their systolic pressure so that's

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.330 
is their systolic pressure so that's
when<00:03:33.209> the<00:03:33.329> heart<00:03:33.569> has<00:03:34.010> contracted<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.190> that's

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
when the heart has contracted and that's

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.580 
when the heart has contracted and that's
the<00:03:35.459> highest<00:03:35.700> pressure<00:03:36.060> and<00:03:36.420> you'll<00:03:37.350> continue

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
the highest pressure and you'll continue

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.330 
the highest pressure and you'll continue
to<00:03:37.920> hear<00:03:38.190> light<00:03:38.609> thumps<00:03:39.150> and<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:40.859> last<00:03:41.100> bump

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
to hear light thumps and the last bump

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:43.879 
to hear light thumps and the last bump
you<00:03:41.489> hear<00:03:41.880> is<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.510> second<00:03:43.170> of<00:03:43.260> your<00:03:43.470> record

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
you hear is the second of your record

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.650 
you hear is the second of your record
and<00:03:44.160> that's<00:03:44.250> their<00:03:44.489> diastolic<00:03:44.880> pressure<00:03:45.299> and

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
and that's their diastolic pressure and

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.440 
and that's their diastolic pressure and
that's<00:03:46.260> when<00:03:46.680> the<00:03:46.799> heart<00:03:47.069> is<00:03:47.370> relaxed<00:03:48.239> and

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
that's when the heart is relaxed and

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.520 
that's when the heart is relaxed and
it's<00:03:48.810> refilling<00:03:49.380> with<00:03:49.500> blood

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:04:00.949 

a<00:03:58.760> lot<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.790> times<00:04:00.060> people<00:04:00.240> a<00:04:00.420> little<00:04:00.720> scared

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:00.959 
a lot of times people a little scared

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:02.510 
a lot of times people a little scared
UPS<00:04:01.140> is<00:04:01.350> kinda<00:04:01.650> more<00:04:01.740> challenging<00:04:02.190> one<00:04:02.340> but

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
UPS is kinda more challenging one but

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.430 
UPS is kinda more challenging one but
with<00:04:02.640> a<00:04:02.670> little<00:04:02.880> bit<00:04:03.060> of<00:04:03.150> practice<00:04:03.330> you<00:04:04.230> guys

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
with a little bit of practice you guys

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.980 
with a little bit of practice you guys
will<00:04:04.590> be<00:04:04.620> stars
