designing<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:04.910> realistic<00:00:05.910> designer<00:00:06.509> bedsheet

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
designing a realistic designer bedsheet

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.790 
designing a realistic designer bedsheet
in<00:00:07.290> 3ds<00:00:07.710> max<00:00:08.040> and<00:00:08.280> Marla's<00:00:08.820> designer<00:00:09.559> so<00:00:10.559> first

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
in 3ds max and Marla's designer so first

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.470 
in 3ds max and Marla's designer so first
of<00:00:10.950> all<00:00:11.099> we<00:00:11.610> are<00:00:11.639> going<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:12.000> create<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
of all we are going to create the

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.950 
of all we are going to create the
collision<00:00:12.960> object<00:00:13.349> in<00:00:13.559> 3ds<00:00:13.920> Max<00:00:14.219> and<00:00:14.960> the

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
collision object in 3ds Max and the

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:18.380 
collision object in 3ds Max and the
collision<00:00:16.320> object<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.830> gonna<00:00:17.100> be<00:00:17.279> our<00:00:17.820> bed<00:00:18.180> and

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
collision object is gonna be our bed and

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.349 
collision object is gonna be our bed and
we're<00:00:19.050> going<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.230> export<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.160> from<00:00:20.670> 3ds<00:00:21.090> max

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
we're going to export that from 3ds max

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.779 
we're going to export that from 3ds max
to<00:00:21.689> Marla's<00:00:22.080> designer<00:00:22.470> so<00:00:23.160> let<00:00:23.400> me<00:00:23.460> just<00:00:23.640> show

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
to Marla's designer so let me just show

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.130 
to Marla's designer so let me just show
you<00:00:23.850> the<00:00:24.119> kind<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.390> output<00:00:24.810> that<00:00:24.960> we're<00:00:25.050> going

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
you the kind of output that we're going

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.700 
you the kind of output that we're going
to<00:00:25.230> get<00:00:25.410> out<00:00:26.070> of<00:00:26.220> this<00:00:26.369> and<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:27.439> technique<00:00:28.439> to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
to get out of this and the technique to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.560 
to get out of this and the technique to
get<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.250> particular<00:00:29.670> output<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.210> very

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
get this particular output is very

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.680 
get this particular output is very
simple<00:00:31.080> if<00:00:32.070> you're<00:00:32.279> following<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.540> right

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
simple if you're following the right

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.790 
simple if you're following the right
technique<00:00:34.110> which<00:00:34.260> I'm<00:00:34.410> going<00:00:34.500> to<00:00:34.559> show<00:00:34.739> you

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
technique which I'm going to show you

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.479 
technique which I'm going to show you
right<00:00:35.010> now<00:00:35.090> so<00:00:36.320> to<00:00:37.320> start<00:00:37.620> off<00:00:37.770> let's<00:00:38.100> just

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
right now so to start off let's just

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:41.869 
right now so to start off let's just
come<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.300> our<00:00:39.329> 3ds<00:00:40.140> Max<00:00:40.440> and<00:00:40.680> let's<00:00:41.489> just<00:00:41.670> start

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
come to our 3ds Max and let's just start

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.900 
come to our 3ds Max and let's just start
off<00:00:42.059> designing<00:00:42.930> our<00:00:43.489> coalition<00:00:44.489> objects

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
off designing our coalition objects

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.040 
off designing our coalition objects
that's<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.239> bit<00:00:45.680> so<00:00:46.680> for<00:00:46.890> that<00:00:47.039> I'll<00:00:47.370> just

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
that's the bit so for that I'll just

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.400 
that's the bit so for that I'll just
draw<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.440> bed<00:00:50.160> right<00:00:50.399> here<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.230> go<00:00:52.230> to<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
draw a bed right here and go to the

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
draw a bed right here and go to the
customize<00:00:52.829> unit<00:00:53.399> set<00:00:53.610> up<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:54.390> make<00:00:54.570> sure<00:00:54.750> it's

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
customize unit set up and make sure it's

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.439 
customize unit set up and make sure it's
and<00:00:55.140> your<00:00:55.410> standard<00:00:55.860> feets<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:56.579> fractional

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
and your standard feets and fractional

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.430 
and your standard feets and fractional
inches<00:00:57.780> so<00:00:58.739> click<00:00:58.949> OK<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.960> if<00:01:00.960> I'm<00:01:01.079> gonna<00:01:01.260> do

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
inches so click OK and if I'm gonna do

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.420 
inches so click OK and if I'm gonna do
is<00:01:01.680> I'm<00:01:02.399> gonna<00:01:02.760> set<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.210> length<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:05.400> length

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
is I'm gonna set the length the length

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.539 
is I'm gonna set the length the length
of<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.210> bed<00:01:06.390> sheet<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.720> gonna<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:07.189> the<00:01:08.189> bed<00:01:08.369> is

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
of the bed sheet is gonna be the bed is

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.500 
of the bed sheet is gonna be the bed is
gonna<00:01:08.760> be<00:01:08.939> like<00:01:09.150> 6<00:01:09.689> feet<00:01:09.960> maybe<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.549> put

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
gonna be like 6 feet maybe so just put

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.010 
gonna be like 6 feet maybe so just put
some<00:01:13.290> length<00:01:13.830> which<00:01:14.130> makes<00:01:14.580> sense<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.869> real

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
some length which makes sense in real

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.399 
some length which makes sense in real
life<00:01:16.400> so<00:01:17.400> the<00:01:18.090> height<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.080> be<00:01:19.170> say

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
life so the height is going to be say

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.740 
life so the height is going to be say
6-inch<00:01:21.140> so<00:01:22.140> once<00:01:22.890> you've<00:01:23.100> done<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.460> much

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
6-inch so once you've done this much

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.690 
6-inch so once you've done this much
your<00:01:24.750> coalition<00:01:25.170> objects<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.009> is<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> bit<00:01:26.460> is

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
your coalition objects that is a bit is

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.450 
your coalition objects that is a bit is
done<00:01:27.509> right<00:01:27.720> now<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.200> there<00:01:29.189> is<00:01:29.220> something

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
done right now and there is something

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.100 
done right now and there is something
important<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.000> you<00:01:30.270> need<00:01:30.509> to<00:01:30.600> keep<00:01:30.780> in<00:01:30.900> mind

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
important that you need to keep in mind

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
important that you need to keep in mind
when<00:01:31.320> you're<00:01:31.409> working<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.860> model

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
when you're working with the model

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.640 
when you're working with the model
design<00:01:32.430> Marvelous<00:01:32.909> Designer<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.509> 3ds<00:01:33.810> max<00:01:34.049> so

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
design Marvelous Designer and 3ds max so

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.230 
design Marvelous Designer and 3ds max so
that<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.950> when<00:01:35.369> you're<00:01:35.490> exporting<00:01:35.729> something

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
that is when you're exporting something

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.690 
that is when you're exporting something
from<00:01:36.600> 3ds<00:01:36.930> max<00:01:37.200> tomorrow<00:01:37.890> let's<00:01:38.189> design<00:01:38.460> what

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
from 3ds max tomorrow let's design what

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.140 
from 3ds max tomorrow let's design what
happens<00:01:39.060> is<00:01:39.380> the<00:01:40.380> XY<00:01:40.950> plane<00:01:41.340> right<00:01:41.700> here<00:01:41.729> where

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
happens is the XY plane right here where

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.510 
happens is the XY plane right here where
you<00:01:42.210> can<00:01:42.360> see<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.500> considered<00:01:44.009> as<00:01:44.189> the

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
you can see it is considered as the

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.120 
you can see it is considered as the
floor

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:46.130 
floor

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.580 
floor
converting<00:01:46.880> or<00:01:47.119> in<00:01:47.329> Europe<00:01:47.810> when<00:01:48.439> you're

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
converting or in Europe when you're

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.980 
converting or in Europe when you're
exporting<00:01:48.829> some<00:01:49.340> object<00:01:49.820> file<00:01:50.000> to<00:01:50.240> Marvelous

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
exporting some object file to Marvelous

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.679 
exporting some object file to Marvelous
Designer<00:01:51.159> so<00:01:52.159> make<00:01:52.340> sure<00:01:52.369> your<00:01:53.030> bed<00:01:53.420> is<00:01:53.630> not

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
Designer so make sure your bed is not

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.520 
Designer so make sure your bed is not
going<00:01:54.470> down<00:01:55.000> but<00:01:56.000> can<00:01:56.210> go<00:01:56.329> up<00:01:56.479> so<00:01:57.229> I'll<00:01:57.320> just

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
going down but can go up so I'll just

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.230 
going down but can go up so I'll just
explain<00:01:57.890> you<00:01:58.009> with<00:01:58.280> the<00:01:58.340> concept<00:01:58.759> behind<00:01:58.909> it

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
explain you with the concept behind it

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.190 
explain you with the concept behind it
so<00:01:59.840> once<00:02:00.350> you're<00:02:00.619> designing<00:02:01.189> a<00:02:01.549> bed<00:02:02.390> sheet<00:02:02.840> or

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
so once you're designing a bed sheet or

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.080 
so once you're designing a bed sheet or
something<00:02:03.289> when<00:02:03.860> it<00:02:03.979> when<00:02:04.369> it's<00:02:04.520> simulated

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
something when it when it's simulated

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.499 
something when it when it's simulated
what<00:02:05.689> happens<00:02:06.049> is<00:02:06.229> this<00:02:07.130> particular<00:02:07.670> XY<00:02:08.149> plane

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
what happens is this particular XY plane

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.620 
what happens is this particular XY plane
is<00:02:08.750> considered<00:02:09.259> as<00:02:09.530> the<00:02:09.560> floor<00:02:10.280> in<00:02:10.940> Marvelous

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
is considered as the floor in Marvelous

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.309 
is considered as the floor in Marvelous
Designer<00:02:11.660> so<00:02:12.500> just<00:02:12.980> place<00:02:13.220> somewhere<00:02:14.319> close

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
Designer so just place somewhere close

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.420 
Designer so just place somewhere close
to<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:16.660> what<00:02:17.660> do<00:02:17.750> you<00:02:17.810> say<00:02:18.050> the<00:02:18.319> floor<00:02:18.709> so<00:02:19.340> you

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
to the what do you say the floor so you

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.670 
to the what do you say the floor so you
can<00:02:19.459> keep<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:19.910> somewhere<00:02:20.120> over<00:02:20.330> here<00:02:20.360> so<00:02:21.319> when

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
can keep it somewhere over here so when

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.170 
can keep it somewhere over here so when
you're<00:02:22.099> doing<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.549> simulation<00:02:22.970> for<00:02:23.090> the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
you're doing the simulation for the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:24.880 
you're doing the simulation for the
bedsheet<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.870> bitch<00:02:24.019> is<00:02:24.170> gonna<00:02:24.349> lie<00:02:24.620> on<00:02:24.799> this

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
bedsheet the bitch is gonna lie on this

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.309 
bedsheet the bitch is gonna lie on this
XY<00:02:25.250> plane<00:02:25.489> right<00:02:25.730> here<00:02:25.940> so<00:02:26.720> once<00:02:27.019> you're<00:02:27.170> done

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
XY plane right here so once you're done

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.720 
XY plane right here so once you're done
with<00:02:27.500> this<00:02:27.739> much<00:02:27.950> design<00:02:28.400> just<00:02:29.239> go<00:02:29.989> to<00:02:30.730> make

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730 
with this much design just go to make

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.360 
with this much design just go to make
sure<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.060> object<00:02:32.510> is<00:02:32.599> selected<00:02:33.019> export<00:02:34.010> and

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
sure the object is selected export and

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.550 
sure the object is selected export and
export<00:02:34.640> selected<00:02:35.330> and<00:02:35.690> once<00:02:36.319> you're<00:02:36.470> done

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:36.560 
export selected and once you're done

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.530 
export selected and once you're done
with<00:02:36.769> that<00:02:36.799> just<00:02:37.190> create<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:37.970> folder<00:02:38.360> wherever

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
with that just create a folder wherever

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.930 
with that just create a folder wherever
you<00:02:38.660> want<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.870> put<00:02:38.989> the<00:02:39.110> folder<00:02:39.470> and<00:02:39.650> then<00:02:40.489> you

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
you want to put the folder and then you

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.620 
you want to put the folder and then you
can<00:02:41.090> do<00:02:41.239> is<00:02:41.450> just<00:02:42.140> create<00:02:42.650> an<00:02:43.069> obj<00:02:43.459> file<00:02:43.700> so

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
can do is just create an obj file so

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.460 
can do is just create an obj file so
this<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.650> name<00:02:45.829> of<00:02:46.010> Champlin<00:02:46.340> over<00:02:46.880> here<00:02:47.150> is

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
this the name of Champlin over here is

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
is import that file into Marvelous

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:15.170 
is import that file into Marvelous
Designer<00:03:10.790> so<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.850> need<00:03:12.210> to<00:03:12.390> import<00:03:12.840> the<00:03:14.180> obj
