00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.160 
going to do half a cup of second that's
the<00:02:03.940> peeling<00:02:04.330> isn't<00:02:04.720> it<00:02:06.600> okay<00:02:07.600> there<00:02:08.020> we've

got a half cup of the silken tofu and

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.970 
got a half cup of the silken tofu and
the<00:02:11.770> next<00:02:12.010> thing<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.310> the<00:02:12.580> two<00:02:12.940> tablespoons<00:02:13.569> of

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
the next thing is the two tablespoons of

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.370 
the next thing is the two tablespoons of
organic<00:02:14.980> unsweetened<00:02:15.870> cocoa<00:02:16.870> powder<00:02:16.900> because

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
organic unsweetened cocoa powder because

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.589 
organic unsweetened cocoa powder because
you<00:02:17.560> want<00:02:17.920> it<00:02:17.950> to<00:02:18.069> be<00:02:18.130> unsweetened<00:02:18.880> so<00:02:19.510> you

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:19.599 
you want it to be unsweetened so you

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:21.570 
you want it to be unsweetened so you
don't<00:02:19.810> get<00:02:19.959> any<00:02:20.140> extra<00:02:20.530> calories<00:02:21.220> in<00:02:21.400> there

that's<00:02:22.060> very<00:02:22.150> important<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.920> since<00:02:24.310> the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
that's very important and since the
