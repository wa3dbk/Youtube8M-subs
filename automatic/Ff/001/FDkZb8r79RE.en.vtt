00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.519
 good today we are going to prepare a recipe 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.279
 ideal for these holidays 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:22.560
 we have all bought the typical nougat 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:24.689
 listen to another and other brands and good 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.480
 we love all adults as much as 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.599
 children and what better to do this same 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.679
 nougat but at home to do it we are going to 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.890
 need 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.190
 200 grams of milk chocolate 200 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.670
 grams of chocolate fondant 80 grams of 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.399
 lard and 70 grams of rice 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.789
 inflated this guy hit krispis or 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.890
 any other brand that we know 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.590
 we are also going to need a box of 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.510
 wood or in this case if we did not have 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.809
 the wooden box that we will form with a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.880
 these oven paper could we use 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:02.940
 also a 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:06.030
 a milk brick cut in half and 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.740
 we would use one of the parts as a mold or 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.140
 you can also use any other 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.290
 mold type in square shape that 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.760
 we could have a tupper a plum mold 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.760
 cake what goes well 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:29.330
 to start let's take and we will join 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:31.990
 the two chocolates in a bowl together with 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.990
 the butter 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:38.130
 and we will undo it in the 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.020
 microwave and we'll put it to the 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.970
 temperature for until undo 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.980
 we have everything well undone good as 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.890
 you can see what we just got out of the 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.870
 microwave we have not left about 5 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.150
 minutes a little more especially if 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.510
 It serves turning that we do not go to 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.190
 burn and that is going away now 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.620
 once we have it undone you see 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.350
 this is very liquid we should leave it 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.900
 temper nothing a few minutes not much more 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.910
 that nothing so that being so liquid 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.920
 it's also start is hot and that 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.470
 when we add the choco krispis not 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.340
 are going to soften us then 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:22.920
 we wait for four or five minutes 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:24.300
 less and then we're good now 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.460
 we have left to tune for about 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.240
 we will add the choco 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.760
 krispis 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.350
 and we'll mix it slowly until 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.350
 everything is all well incorporated 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.579
 well once we have it all 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:49.480
 well mixed because now we only have left 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:53.519
 the final step that is to add it to the 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.519
 box that we already had prepared 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.300
 we distribute it well so that we stay 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.300
 well squared 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:22.220
 we have for 22 tablets that is 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.470
 we can do it in two boxes and we have 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.760
 as I have told you before in 2 briks of 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.189
 milk and let it cool 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.580
 well as you can see we have already been 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:36.570
 solidified 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:39.750
 and now he is ready to serve and to 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:42.000
 for what we want we can leave for 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.120
 example we can return it well in 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.880
 our own little box and we already have a 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.190
 gift for 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.620
 for any family member or what 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.420
 we want or we can use the box 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:04:00.810
 just mold and wrap the paper of 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:05.070
 these plastic and well I will make a 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.700
 gift as we like it if not then what 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:09.990
 we can eat and enjoy I hope that you 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.190
