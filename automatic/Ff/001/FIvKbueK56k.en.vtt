awesome good games coming out for the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.529 
awesome good games coming out for the
ps3<00:00:51.360> so<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.590> bought<00:00:53.070> the<00:00:53.219> ps3<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.940> couple<00:00:54.360> years

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
ps3 so I bought the ps3 a couple years

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.600 
ps3 so I bought the ps3 a couple years
ago<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.350> I<00:00:55.379> would<00:00:55.770> not<00:00:55.949> be<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.190> person<00:00:56.370> to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
ago so I would not be the person to

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.610 
ago so I would not be the person to
actually<00:00:56.820> buy<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> ps4<00:00:57.719> at<00:00:58.050> this<00:00:58.199> time<00:00:58.440> because

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
actually buy a ps4 at this time because

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.869 
actually buy a ps4 at this time because
most<00:00:58.920> likely<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.399> to<00:00:59.489> be<00:00:59.640> very

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
most likely it's going to be very

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.150 
most likely it's going to be very
expensive<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.899> will<00:01:01.410> only<00:01:01.559> bring<00:01:01.800> down<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
expensive and will only bring down the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.640 
expensive and will only bring down the
price<00:01:02.309> later<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:03.390> and<00:01:03.719> Sony's<00:01:04.199> doing<00:01:04.439> pretty

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
price later so and Sony's doing pretty

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.410 
price later so and Sony's doing pretty
bad<00:01:04.830> right<00:01:05.010> now<00:01:05.189> so<00:01:05.339> i<00:01:05.519> think<00:01:05.610> what<00:01:06.060> sony

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
bad right now so i think what sony

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.960 
bad right now so i think what sony
should<00:01:06.570> do<00:01:06.659> is<00:01:06.780> release<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.229> ps3<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.610> couple

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
should do is release the ps3 in a couple

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.899 
should do is release the ps3 in a couple
years<00:01:09.000> probably<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.990> the<00:01:10.080> next<00:01:10.260> three<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.670> four

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
years probably in the next three to four

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.730 
years probably in the next three to four
years<00:01:11.970> would<00:01:12.659> be<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.780> good<00:01:12.990> time<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.470> ps3

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
years would be a good time for the ps3

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.280 
years would be a good time for the ps3
i'm<00:01:14.070> saying<00:01:14.280> three<00:01:14.610> years<00:01:14.909> give<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:15.960> three

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
i'm saying three years give it three

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.859 
i'm saying three years give it three
years<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.770> then<00:01:17.280> release<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> ps4<00:01:18.000> which

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
years and then release the ps4 which

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.990 
years and then release the ps4 which
will<00:01:19.020> be<00:01:19.170> perfect<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.310> meantime<00:01:20.549> what

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
will be perfect in the meantime what

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.359 
will be perfect in the meantime what
they<00:01:21.119> can<00:01:21.299> do<00:01:21.420> is<00:01:21.570> release<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:22.020> PS<00:01:22.619> three<00:01:22.650> point

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
they can do is release a PS three point

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.640 
they can do is release a PS three point
five<00:01:23.729> that's<00:01:24.479> not<00:01:24.810> just<00:01:25.020> that's<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.259> my<00:01:25.500> idea

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
five that's not just that's just my idea

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.160 
five that's not just that's just my idea
that's<00:01:26.159> just<00:01:26.310> my<00:01:26.430> opinion<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:27.090> with<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> 3.5

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
that's just my opinion and with the 3.5

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.679 
that's just my opinion and with the 3.5
they<00:01:28.860> could<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.579> faster<00:01:30.119> processor

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
they could have just a faster processor

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.740 
they could have just a faster processor
reason<00:01:31.530> being<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.950> because<00:01:31.979> when<00:01:32.909> I'm<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.329> game

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
reason being is because when I'm in game

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.469 
reason being is because when I'm in game
and<00:01:34.079> I<00:01:34.200> open<00:01:34.710> up<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.890> cross<00:01:35.670> media<00:01:35.970> bar<00:01:36.299> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
and I open up the cross media bar the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.609 
and I open up the cross media bar the
XMB<00:01:37.579> it's<00:01:38.579> kind<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:39.000> slow<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.329> laggy<00:01:39.750> so<00:01:40.500> if

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
XMB it's kind of slow and laggy so if

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.380 
XMB it's kind of slow and laggy so if
they<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:40.920> give<00:01:41.159> it<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.310> faster<00:01:41.759> processor

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
they just give it a faster processor

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.590 
they just give it a faster processor
they<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.470> fix<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.100> issue<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.970> then<00:01:45.180> it<00:01:45.329> won't

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
they can fix that issue so then it won't

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.420 
they can fix that issue so then it won't
be<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:45.960> laggy<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:46.530> slow<00:01:46.590> while<00:01:47.070> you're<00:01:47.250> in

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
be as laggy and slow while you're in

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.850 
be as laggy and slow while you're in
game<00:01:47.729> when<00:01:47.939> you're<00:01:48.060> open<00:01:48.390> up<00:01:48.540> that<00:01:48.860> XMB

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
game when you're open up that XMB

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.310 
game when you're open up that XMB
because<00:01:50.549> while<00:01:50.909> you're<00:01:51.119> well<00:01:51.930> you're<00:01:52.110> not

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
because while you're well you're not

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.469 
because while you're well you're not
playing<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.710> game<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.399> xmb<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.880> fine<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.180> know

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
playing a game the xmb is fine you know

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.050 
playing a game the xmb is fine you know
obviously<00:01:54.780> it's<00:01:55.229> just<00:01:55.409> working<00:01:55.860> smoothly<00:01:56.310> but

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
obviously it's just working smoothly but

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.999 
obviously it's just working smoothly but
while<00:01:57.329> you're<00:01:57.509> in<00:01:57.630> game<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.049> just<00:01:58.290> laggy<00:01:58.649> so<00:01:58.950> I

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
while you're in game is just laggy so I

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.060 
while you're in game is just laggy so I
think<00:01:59.100> if<00:01:59.340> they<00:01:59.490> fix<00:01:59.790> that<00:02:00.000> with<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> PS<00:02:00.509> PS<00:02:01.229> 3.5

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
think if they fix that with a PS PS 3.5

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.580 
think if they fix that with a PS PS 3.5
it<00:02:02.340> will<00:02:02.430> be<00:02:02.549> perfect<00:02:02.899> anyways<00:02:03.899> we'll<00:02:04.380> see

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
it will be perfect anyways we'll see

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.950 
it will be perfect anyways we'll see
