the web console for the printer and you

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.320 
the web console for the printer and you
can<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.590> some<00:01:10.800> useful<00:01:11.159> information<00:01:11.340> there

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
can see some useful information there

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.350 
can see some useful information there
are<00:01:12.390> two<00:01:12.540> things<00:01:12.870> on<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.229> web<00:01:14.190> browser<00:01:14.490> for

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
are two things on the web browser for

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.850 
are two things on the web browser for
the<00:01:15.510> printer<00:01:15.840> I<00:01:15.870> think<00:01:15.990> are<00:01:16.320> interesting

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
the printer I think are interesting

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.700 
the printer I think are interesting
first<00:01:17.040> is<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.940> shows<00:01:18.390> you<00:01:18.420> your<00:01:18.930> real<00:01:19.440> ink

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
first is it shows you your real ink

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.050 
first is it shows you your real ink
levels<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.760> black<00:01:21.060> is<00:01:21.330> 77<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.530> rest<00:01:22.770> or<00:01:23.100> 68

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
levels so black is 77 and the rest or 68

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.330 
levels so black is 77 and the rest or 68
if<00:01:24.270> we<00:01:25.020> scroll<00:01:25.320> down<00:01:25.350> just<00:01:25.830> a<00:01:25.920> little<00:01:25.950> bit

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
if we scroll down just a little bit

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.730 
if we scroll down just a little bit
you'll<00:01:26.970> see<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.570> it's<00:01:27.810> showing<00:01:27.870> all<00:01:28.380> our

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
you'll see that it's showing all our

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.000 
you'll see that it's showing all our
paper<00:01:29.040> sources<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.300> this<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.450> very<00:01:30.600> useful

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010 
paper sources so this is very useful

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.370 
paper sources so this is very useful
information<00:01:32.010> if<00:01:32.970> you<00:01:33.240> happen<00:01:33.690> to<00:01:33.720> want<00:01:34.290> to

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
information if you happen to want to

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.840 
information if you happen to want to
know<00:01:34.500> what's<00:01:34.830> happening<00:01:35.220> at<00:01:35.370> the<00:01:35.490> printer

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
know what's happening at the printer

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.270 
know what's happening at the printer
next<00:01:36.690> is<00:01:37.080> we're<00:01:37.350> ready<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.710> actually<00:01:38.100> do<00:01:38.250> a

is<00:03:45.060> will<00:03:45.239> orientate<00:03:45.840> this<00:03:46.230> here<00:03:46.949> we're<00:03:47.579> going

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:47.699 
is will orientate this here we're going

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:49.670 
is will orientate this here we're going
to<00:03:47.760> put<00:03:47.970> just<00:03:48.000> a<00:03:48.389> little<00:03:48.419> bit<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.959> a<00:03:49.049> mist<00:03:49.379> of

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
to put just a little bit of a mist of

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.830 
to put just a little bit of a mist of
pro<00:03:50.190> spray<00:03:50.519> to<00:03:50.579> hold<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:50.940> transfer<00:03:51.180> on<00:03:51.660> and

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 
pro spray to hold the transfer on and

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.300 
pro spray to hold the transfer on and
we'll<00:03:54.840> spray<00:03:55.139> it<00:03:55.260> normally<00:03:55.590> you'd<00:03:55.739> spray<00:03:56.040> Pro

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
we'll spray it normally you'd spray Pro

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.089 
we'll spray it normally you'd spray Pro
spray<00:03:56.609> over<00:03:56.940> a<00:03:57.650> garbage<00:03:58.650> can

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
spray over a garbage can

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.789 
spray over a garbage can
so<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.699> mist<00:03:59.940> doesn't<00:04:00.299> get<00:04:00.449> on<00:04:00.599> there<00:04:00.810> and<00:04:01.049> so

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
so the mist doesn't get on there and so

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:04.069 
so the mist doesn't get on there and so
Pro<00:04:02.099> spray<00:04:02.400> is<00:04:02.459> an<00:04:02.609> alternative<00:04:03.389> to<00:04:03.659> heat<00:04:03.840> tape

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:04.079 
Pro spray is an alternative to heat tape

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.740 
Pro spray is an alternative to heat tape
so<00:04:04.829> now<00:04:05.010> what<00:04:05.220> we're<00:04:05.340> going<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.519> do<00:04:05.760> is<00:04:06.329> we're

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
so now what we're going to do is we're

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.780 
so now what we're going to do is we're
going<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.930> take<00:04:07.139> our<00:04:07.319> plaque<00:04:07.560> keyholes<00:04:08.549> are<00:04:08.729> in

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
going to take our plaque keyholes are in

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.509 
going to take our plaque keyholes are in
the<00:04:08.879> right<00:04:09.030> orientation<00:04:09.239> and<00:04:10.010> we're<00:04:11.010> going<00:04:11.340> to

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
the right orientation and we're going to

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.740 
the right orientation and we're going to
place<00:04:11.879> it<00:04:12.150> in<00:04:12.510> the<00:04:13.379> right<00:04:13.799> spot<00:04:14.239> so<00:04:15.239> that<00:04:15.269> we

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
place it in the right spot so that we

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.819 
place it in the right spot so that we
get<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.229> great<00:04:16.949> straight<00:04:17.760> transfer<00:04:18.630> and<00:04:18.900> of

00:04:19.819 --> 00:04:19.829 
get a great straight transfer and of

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.060 
get a great straight transfer and of
course<00:04:20.039> I<00:04:20.250> always<00:04:20.729> struggle<00:04:21.359> with<00:04:22.320> making

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
course I always struggle with making

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:24.350 
course I always struggle with making
things<00:04:23.580> straight

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
things straight

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.200 
things straight
so<00:04:25.260> kind<00:04:25.740> of<00:04:25.800> stuff<00:04:26.099> and<00:04:26.520> you<00:04:26.580> can<00:04:26.849> smooth<00:04:27.090> it

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
so kind of stuff and you can smooth it

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.110 
so kind of stuff and you can smooth it
out<00:04:29.060> put<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.090> in<00:04:30.210> your<00:04:30.330> heat<00:04:30.539> press<00:04:30.720> and<00:04:32.120> what
