00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.350
 The pink came to thought about what was gray 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.260
 dolphin 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.840
 but did not yet know how 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.860
 he could make the fish clear that 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.220
 he was just as sweet as everyone else 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:33.690

 yellow fish 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.470
 with a purple ball playing 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.060
 she headed the purple ball up and down and 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.630
 had a lot of fun 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.630
 in their game 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:50.430

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:53.850
 seaweed 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.019

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.510
 the ball was stuck in the green seaweed 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.340
 Suddenly she saw the pink jellyfish again what 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.030

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.299

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:27.900
 jellyfish swam to the purple ball and grabbed 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.959
 the one with his tentacles and so he drew the 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:33.840
 ball from the green seaweed 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.019
 he threw the purple ball at the yellow one 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.110
 little fishes that smiled at him 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:44.010

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:47.730

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.980
 the ball back to the jellyfish 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.120
