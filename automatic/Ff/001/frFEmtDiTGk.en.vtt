six<00:03:22.739> more<00:03:22.920> satellites<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.760> was<00:03:23.910> wondering

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
six more satellites and I was wondering

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.430 
six more satellites and I was wondering
if<00:03:24.330> we<00:03:24.480> would<00:03:24.600> be<00:03:24.870> able<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.080> get<00:03:25.200> better

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
if we would be able to get better

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.740 
if we would be able to get better
coverage<00:03:26.040> with<00:03:26.820> the<00:03:26.940> new<00:03:27.060> satellite<00:03:27.510> launch

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
coverage with the new satellite launch

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.530 
coverage with the new satellite launch
and<00:03:28.020> already<00:03:28.320> it<00:03:28.470> seems<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:28.920> we<00:03:29.070> are<00:03:29.540> because

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
and already it seems like we are because

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.479 
and already it seems like we are because
the<00:03:30.989> last<00:03:31.170> few<00:03:31.500> times<00:03:31.530> I've<00:03:31.920> used<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.250> phone

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
the last few times I've used the phone

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.710 
the last few times I've used the phone
we've<00:03:33.239> had<00:03:34.550> on<00:03:35.550> the<00:03:35.790> front<00:03:36.060> end<00:03:36.180> of<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.480> time

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
we've had on the front end of the time

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
window and the back end of the time

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.890 
window and the back end of the time
window<00:03:38.489> it's<00:03:38.760> been<00:03:38.940> kind<00:03:39.150> of<00:03:39.239> spotty<00:03:39.510> but<00:03:39.810> in

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
window it's been kind of spotty but in

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.060 
window it's been kind of spotty but in
the<00:03:39.989> middle<00:03:40.200> I've<00:03:40.320> always<00:03:40.560> been<00:03:40.680> able<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.920> get

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
off a good two or three-minute call

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.050 
off a good two or three-minute call

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
know I did a battery test where I left

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.030 
know I did a battery test where I left
it<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:15.540> standby<00:04:15.870> mode<00:04:16.109> at<00:04:16.260> home<00:04:16.440> for<00:04:16.739> a<00:04:16.769> couple

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
it in standby mode at home for a couple

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.740 
it in standby mode at home for a couple
of<00:04:17.100> hours<00:04:17.430> a<00:04:17.459> night<00:04:17.760> for<00:04:17.820> four<00:04:18.450> or<00:04:18.570> five<00:04:18.720> nights

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
of hours a night for four or five nights

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:21.860 
of hours a night for four or five nights
straight<00:04:19.470> and<00:04:19.739> still<00:04:20.489> had<00:04:21.060> good<00:04:21.390> battery<00:04:21.810> life

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
straight and still had good battery life

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.140 
straight and still had good battery life
so<00:04:22.320> leaving<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.680> in<00:04:22.740> standby<00:04:23.070> wouldn't<00:04:24.000> worry

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
so leaving it in standby wouldn't worry

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:26.840 
so leaving it in standby wouldn't worry
too<00:04:24.240> much<00:04:24.360> about<00:04:24.510> that<00:04:25.190> it's<00:04:26.190> not<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> big<00:04:26.640> deal

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:26.850 
too much about that it's not a big deal

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.430 
too much about that it's not a big deal
you<00:04:26.880> still<00:04:27.390> have<00:04:27.479> plenty<00:04:27.630> of<00:04:27.810> time<00:04:27.990> to<00:04:28.020> talk

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
you still have plenty of time to talk

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.779 
you still have plenty of time to talk
it's<00:04:28.800> when<00:04:28.950> you're<00:04:29.070> talking<00:04:29.430> that<00:04:29.520> you<00:04:29.640> run

00:04:29.779 --> 00:04:29.789 
it's when you're talking that you run

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:30.649 
it's when you're talking that you run
the<00:04:29.820> battery

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
the battery

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:32.749 
the battery
so<00:04:31.259> as<00:04:31.740> long<00:04:31.830> as<00:04:32.039> you're<00:04:32.220> not<00:04:32.250> leaving<00:04:32.610> it<00:04:32.699> in

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:32.759 
so as long as you're not leaving it in

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.420 
so as long as you're not leaving it in
standby<00:04:33.060> mode<00:04:33.180> and<00:04:33.840> trying<00:04:34.800> to<00:04:34.919> talk<00:04:35.129> for<00:04:35.310> long

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
standby mode and trying to talk for long

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.040 
standby mode and trying to talk for long
periods<00:04:35.849> of<00:04:35.879> time<00:04:36.090> you<00:04:36.120> should<00:04:36.509> be<00:04:36.599> just<00:04:36.780> fine

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
periods of time you should be just fine

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.350 
periods of time you should be just fine
so<00:04:37.800> I<00:04:37.830> think<00:04:37.949> as<00:04:38.250> an<00:04:38.340> emergency<00:04:38.879> phone<00:04:39.120> to

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
so I think as an emergency phone to

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.230 
so I think as an emergency phone to
carry<00:04:39.569> with<00:04:39.810> you<00:04:40.020> I<00:04:40.610> really<00:04:41.610> like<00:04:41.819> it's<00:04:42.030> nice

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:42.240 
carry with you I really like it's nice

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.010 
carry with you I really like it's nice
and<00:04:42.539> nice<00:04:43.229> and<00:04:43.439> light<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:44.599> I<00:04:45.599> like<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.870> red

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
and nice and light and I like the red

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.580 
and nice and light and I like the red
color<00:04:46.259> too<00:04:46.560> by<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.800> high<00:04:46.979> safety<00:04:47.729> red<00:04:48.199> and<00:04:49.199> I'm

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
color too by the high safety red and I'm

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.379 
color too by the high safety red and I'm
picking<00:04:50.250> up<00:04:50.340> a<00:04:50.460> really<00:04:50.699> nice<00:04:50.849> signal<00:04:51.270> right

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
picking up a really nice signal right

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.320 
picking up a really nice signal right
now<00:04:51.599> so<00:04:51.960> that's<00:04:52.740> nice<00:04:53.069> it's<00:04:53.370> got<00:04:53.520> a<00:04:53.550> nice

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
now so that's nice it's got a nice

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.230 
now so that's nice it's got a nice
screen<00:04:55.020> display<00:04:55.699> and<00:04:56.699> I<00:04:56.789> think<00:04:57.000> we<00:04:57.090> went

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
screen display and I think we went

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.760 
screen display and I think we went
through<00:04:57.419> that<00:04:57.509> on<00:04:57.569> part<00:04:57.960> one<00:04:58.139> of<00:04:58.169> this<00:04:58.439> test

00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:58.770 
through that on part one of this test

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.129 
through that on part one of this test
but<00:05:00.500> it's<00:05:01.500> it's<00:05:01.919> a<00:05:02.099> nice<00:05:02.400> full<00:05:03.360> function<00:05:03.840> phone

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
but it's it's a nice full function phone

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:06.830 
but it's it's a nice full function phone
it<00:05:05.099> does<00:05:05.280> have<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.490> data<00:05:05.789> port<00:05:06.180> if<00:05:06.419> you<00:05:06.569> wanted

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
it does have a data port if you wanted

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.529 
it does have a data port if you wanted
to<00:05:06.990> connect<00:05:07.349> a<00:05:07.440> computer<00:05:07.830> to<00:05:08.009> it<00:05:08.190> I<00:05:08.729> don't<00:05:09.180> plan

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
to connect a computer to it I don't plan

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:13.850 
to connect a computer to it I don't plan
to<00:05:09.599> ever<00:05:09.870> use<00:05:10.409> that<00:05:10.969> I<00:05:12.229> might<00:05:13.229> if<00:05:13.590> they<00:05:13.740> ever

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
to ever use that I might if they ever

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.640 
to ever use that I might if they ever
once<00:05:14.669> the<00:05:14.789> service<00:05:15.120> comes<00:05:15.389> full<00:05:15.780> on<00:05:16.110> I<00:05:16.440> might

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:16.650 
once the service comes full on I might

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.439 
once the service comes full on I might
give<00:05:16.830> it<00:05:16.949> a<00:05:17.009> try<00:05:17.039> at<00:05:17.490> home<00:05:17.669> just<00:05:17.909> to<00:05:18.030> see<00:05:18.210> how<00:05:18.330> it

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
give it a try at home just to see how it

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.689 
give it a try at home just to see how it
works<00:05:18.690> but<00:05:19.590> I<00:05:19.620> don't<00:05:19.919> actually<00:05:20.099> have<00:05:20.340> the

00:05:20.689 --> 00:05:20.699 
works but I don't actually have the

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:23.959 
works but I don't actually have the
cable<00:05:21.000> connector<00:05:21.330> at<00:05:21.419> this<00:05:21.539> time<00:05:22.009> so<00:05:23.009> that's

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:23.969 
cable connector at this time so that's

00:05:23.969 --> 00:05:25.580 
cable connector at this time so that's
the<00:05:24.270> report<00:05:24.389> from<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.779> San<00:05:24.990> Pedro<00:05:25.169> parks

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:25.590 
the report from the San Pedro parks

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.839 
the report from the San Pedro parks

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:33.980 
wilderness on the Globalstar sat
review<00:05:29.849> and<00:05:30.710> nice<00:05:31.710> wide<00:05:31.979> open<00:05:32.279> meadow<00:05:32.750> so<00:05:33.750> that

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990 
review and nice wide open meadow so that

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.369 
review and nice wide open meadow so that
certainly<00:05:34.590> helps<00:05:35.180> with<00:05:36.409> the<00:05:37.409> reception<00:05:38.150> so

00:05:39.369 --> 00:05:39.379 
certainly helps with the reception so

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:41.269 
certainly helps with the reception so
beautiful<00:05:40.379> day<00:05:40.560> I<00:05:40.590> don't<00:05:40.860> know<00:05:41.009> how<00:05:41.129> we've

00:05:41.269 --> 00:05:41.279 
beautiful day I don't know how we've

00:05:41.279 --> 00:05:44.119 
beautiful day I don't know how we've
escaped<00:05:41.669> rain<00:05:41.940> today<00:05:42.180> so<00:05:42.360> far<00:05:42.960> and<00:05:43.469> it's<00:05:43.949> easy

00:05:44.119 --> 00:05:44.129 
escaped rain today so far and it's easy

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:47.890 
escaped rain today so far and it's easy
to<00:05:44.219> knock<00:05:44.460> on<00:05:44.639> wood<00:05:44.789> in<00:05:44.940> the<00:05:45.060> forest<00:05:45.620> so

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
to knock on wood in the forest so

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:54.019 
to knock on wood in the forest so
definitely<00:05:49.879> a<00:05:50.879> safety<00:05:51.870> device<00:05:52.139> that<00:05:52.940> that<00:05:53.940> I

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:54.029 
definitely a safety device that that I

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:56.510 
definitely a safety device that that I
will<00:05:54.089> carry<00:05:54.419> with<00:05:54.509> me<00:05:54.870> I<00:05:55.110> hope<00:05:55.979> you<00:05:56.099> enjoyed

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
part two of the review and again highly

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.779 
part two of the review and again highly
recommend<00:06:00.539> this<00:06:00.659> phone<00:06:00.960> I<00:06:01.400> hope<00:06:02.400> that<00:06:02.669> when

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
recommend this phone I hope that when

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:05.089 
recommend this phone I hope that when
they<00:06:02.909> go<00:06:03.089> to<00:06:03.120> full<00:06:03.389> service<00:06:03.930> which<00:06:04.830> hopefully

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
they go to full service which hopefully

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.839 
they go to full service which hopefully
is<00:06:05.460> also<00:06:05.819> at<00:06:05.940> the<00:06:06.029> end<00:06:06.060> of<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:06.300> year<00:06:06.599> that<00:06:07.849> they

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
is also at the end of the year that they

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:10.610 
is also at the end of the year that they
continue<00:06:09.479> to<00:06:09.539> cut<00:06:09.779> those<00:06:09.990> of<00:06:10.169> us<00:06:10.259> that<00:06:10.440> stuck

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:10.620 
continue to cut those of us that stuck

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.320 
continue to cut those of us that stuck
with<00:06:10.650> them<00:06:10.979> through<00:06:11.159> this<00:06:11.279> period<00:06:11.520> a<00:06:11.819> deal<00:06:12.060> I

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
with them through this period a deal I

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:14.749 
with them through this period a deal I
am<00:06:12.930> a<00:06:12.990> little<00:06:13.229> concerned<00:06:13.409> about<00:06:13.889> the<00:06:14.370> company

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
am a little concerned about the company

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:17.269 
am a little concerned about the company
their<00:06:15.719> stock<00:06:15.930> value<00:06:16.319> plummeted<00:06:16.770> their<00:06:16.949> CEO

00:06:17.269 --> 00:06:17.279 
their stock value plummeted their CEO

00:06:17.279 --> 00:06:21.260 
their stock value plummeted their CEO
left<00:06:17.729> so<00:06:18.599> I<00:06:18.629> hope<00:06:19.139> they<00:06:19.460> can<00:06:20.460> make<00:06:20.490> it<00:06:20.759> and

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:21.270 
left so I hope they can make it and

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:23.809 
left so I hope they can make it and
don't<00:06:21.509> go<00:06:21.599> out<00:06:21.690> of<00:06:21.810> business<00:06:21.930> or<00:06:22.560> if<00:06:23.250> they<00:06:23.759> do

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
don't go out of business or if they do

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:27.290 
don't go out of business or if they do
get<00:06:24.089> bought<00:06:24.330> out<00:06:24.539> by<00:06:25.069> another<00:06:26.069> company<00:06:26.370> that

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
get bought out by another company that

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.159 
get bought out by another company that
we<00:06:27.930> don't<00:06:28.110> lose<00:06:29.000> the<00:06:30.000> relationship<00:06:30.599> we've

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
we don't lose the relationship we've

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.869 
we don't lose the relationship we've
already<00:06:31.319> established<00:06:31.529> with<00:06:32.009> Globalstar<00:06:33.409> so

00:06:34.869 --> 00:06:34.879 
already established with Globalstar so

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:37.430 
already established with Globalstar so
definitely<00:06:35.879> keep<00:06:36.509> an<00:06:36.659> eye<00:06:36.779> on<00:06:36.810> the<00:06:37.050> company

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
definitely keep an eye on the company

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.379 
definitely keep an eye on the company
and<00:06:37.710> you<00:06:38.459> might<00:06:38.610> want<00:06:38.789> to<00:06:38.819> check<00:06:38.969> into<00:06:39.149> it

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:39.389 
and you might want to check into it

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:40.760 
and you might want to check into it
before<00:06:39.509> you<00:06:39.750> actually<00:06:39.899> purchase<00:06:40.440> the<00:06:40.589> phone

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
before you actually purchase the phone
