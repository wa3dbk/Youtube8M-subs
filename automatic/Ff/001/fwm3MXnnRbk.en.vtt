00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
why they are actually weapon variance

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.660 
why they are actually weapon variance
but<00:00:10.050> kind<00:00:10.320> of<00:00:10.410> are<00:00:10.530> like<00:00:10.679> self-made<00:00:11.309> weapon

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
this is what they call gunsmith now

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.670 
this is what they call gunsmith now
gunsmith<00:01:05.519> is<00:01:05.729> where<00:01:06.000> you<00:01:06.330> create<00:01:06.750> your<00:01:07.170> weapon

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
gunsmith is where you create your weapon

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.020 
gunsmith is where you create your weapon
variants<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.340> yes<00:01:08.490> we're<00:01:08.610> gonna<00:01:08.700> call<00:01:08.909> them

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
variants and yes we're gonna call them

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.130 
variants and yes we're gonna call them
weapon<00:01:09.299> variant<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:09.630> as<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:09.810> can<00:01:09.869> see<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.080> can

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
weapon variant so as you can see you can

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.590 
weapon variant so as you can see you can
have<00:01:10.320> one<00:01:10.619> optic<00:01:11.130> and<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.180> top<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.420> that

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
have one optic and then on top of that

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.160 
have one optic and then on top of that
five<00:01:13.110> attachment<00:01:13.799> 1<00:01:14.340> paint<00:01:14.640> job<00:01:14.939> and<00:01:15.180> one<00:01:15.630> camo

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
five attachment 1 paint job and one camo

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.080 
five attachment 1 paint job and one camo
so<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.890> optic<00:01:17.369> is<00:01:17.520> pretty<00:01:17.790> straight<00:01:18.060> forward

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090

drops his kind of surprised me because

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.580 
drops his kind of surprised me because
simply<00:03:12.630> sledgehammer<00:03:13.630> made<00:03:13.870> so<00:03:14.200> so<00:03:14.410> much

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
simply sledgehammer made so so much

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:16.380 
simply sledgehammer made so so much
money<00:03:14.830> on<00:03:14.980> them<00:03:15.130> yet<00:03:15.760> they're<00:03:15.940> showing<00:03:16.239> that

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
money on them yet they're showing that

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.350

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
aesthetically these have different

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:21.060 
aesthetically these have different
attachments<00:03:19.360> but<00:03:19.660> for<00:03:19.900> the<00:03:19.989> same<00:03:20.320> gun<00:03:20.709> for<00:03:21.010> the

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
attachments but for the same gun for the

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.770 
attachments but for the same gun for the
same<00:03:21.280> type<00:03:21.579> of<00:03:21.610> attachments<00:03:22.239> which<00:03:22.360> is<00:03:22.480> very

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
same type of attachments which is very

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.630 
same type of attachments which is very
very<00:03:23.019> odd<00:03:23.170> never<00:03:23.380> been<00:03:23.590> done<00:03:23.739> before<00:03:23.860> we<00:03:24.459> don't

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
very odd never been done before we don't

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:25.620 
very odd never been done before we don't
know<00:03:24.700> whether<00:03:24.820> these<00:03:25.000> have<00:03:25.180> different<00:03:25.209> stats

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
know whether these have different stats

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.390 
know whether these have different stats
now<00:03:25.810> what<00:03:25.930> I<00:03:25.959> was<00:03:26.049> thinking<00:03:26.440> is<00:03:26.680> if<00:03:27.220> they<00:03:27.340> do

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
now what I was thinking is if they do

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.840 
now what I was thinking is if they do
throw<00:03:27.820> supply<00:03:28.269> drops<00:03:28.570> into<00:03:28.840> black<00:03:29.320> ops<00:03:29.590> 3<00:03:29.860> just

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
throw supply drops into black ops 3 just

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.449 
throw supply drops into black ops 3 just
what<00:03:31.269> if<00:03:31.600> you<00:03:32.500> get<00:03:32.680> different<00:03:32.920> types<00:03:33.340> of

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
what if you get different types of

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:34.860 
what if you get different types of
attachments<00:03:34.030> for<00:03:34.150> different<00:03:34.420> types<00:03:34.510> of<00:03:34.690> guns

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
attachments for different types of guns

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.870 
attachments for different types of guns
that<00:03:35.470> do<00:03:35.769> do<00:03:35.950> different<00:03:36.340> things<00:03:36.370> they<00:03:36.640> put<00:03:36.790> out

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
that do do different things they put out

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.250 
that do do different things they put out
different<00:03:37.209> damages<00:03:37.690> they<00:03:37.810> do<00:03:37.870> different

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
different damages they do different

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.470 
different damages they do different
types<00:03:38.440> of<00:03:38.560> recoil<00:03:39.010> all<00:03:39.400> of<00:03:39.970> that<00:03:40.000> what<00:03:40.299> if<00:03:40.390> they

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:40.480 
types of recoil all of that what if they

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.259 
types of recoil all of that what if they
did<00:03:40.720> all<00:03:40.989> of<00:03:41.019> that<00:03:41.290> in<00:03:41.769> supply<00:03:42.100> drops<00:03:42.400> and<00:03:42.640> have

did all of that in supply drops and have

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.610 
did all of that in supply drops and have
a<00:03:43.299> ton<00:03:43.630> of<00:03:43.660> different<00:03:43.989> camels<00:03:44.440> like<00:03:44.530> I'm

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
could all get from supply drops how

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.640 
could all get from supply drops how
amazing<00:03:49.329> would<00:03:49.570> that<00:03:49.630> be<00:03:49.930> I<00:03:49.959> think<00:03:50.170> that<00:03:50.500> would
