00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:16.640
 as we have said several times the 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.410
 history is full of facts and bizarre that 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.220
 position themselves on the border between reality and 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.400
 fantasy 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.260
 the story we are going to tell you 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.690
 it concerns the teleportation a very theme 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.820
 common in the literature in the film e 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.070
 in science fiction object of 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.110
 speculation for decades because no one knows 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.330
 what side effects it may have 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.580
 teleportation certainly would be one 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.770
 very useful and convenient technique also 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.480
 in everyday life it might 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.430
 also change the face of war 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.430
 modern and make impossible 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.900
 track down criminals this at least in 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.989
 context of a teleportation e 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.790
 scientific aware and controlled but 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.250
 what could happen if they didn't exist 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.159
 a check this is just what 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.050
 a soldier happened in the sixteenth century 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:03.769
 here is the story of Gilbert and the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.380
 gil spontaneous teleportation because it was a 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.570
 soldier lived in the sixteenth century 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.760
 he was a member of the civil guard 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.680
 Filipino and worked as a guard at 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.820
 governor's palace in manila la 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.880
 capital of the Philippines 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.979
 his is a quiet and fulfilling life 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.289
 his duty at the palace but during a 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:24.079
 his watch would have happened 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:27.100
 something really weird gil fu 

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:30.520
 victim of spontaneous teleportation 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:34.390
 all this would have happened on the 24th 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.070
 nice 1593 a few days before the pirates 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.680
 Chinese had murdered her for 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.509
 the tension was very high and the vest 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.700
 he was as usual doing his own 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.979
 guard duty at the palace when at a 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.340
 certain point tired for the many hours of 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.440
 work 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.750
 I decided to lean against a wall for 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.820
 rest a moment already closed his eyes 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.610
 and when the Jews found themselves in a 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.979
 completely unknown place confused 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.570
 and uncertain how to behave continued 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.100
 perform his on-call duties 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.770
 when he was approached by a person 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.929
 that made him understand he was plaza mayor 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.509
 the city of mexico to thousands of 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:09.610
 kilometers from manila gil he was questioned 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:11.410
 by the authorities and the presumed down payment 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.120
 teleportation and the death of 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.250
 governor but of course no one 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.840
 predicts that absurd story also 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.430
 because the news of the death of 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.310
 Governor has not yet come in 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.840
 Mexico was imprisoned in a given prison 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.910
 which it was thought could be a 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.930
 deserter or even a servant of the 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:27.880
 Devil 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.190
 two months later, however, it comes from 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.260
 Philippine ship carrying the news 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:34.570
 of the governor's death the authorities 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.370
 Mexican then reported of Gil Perez 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.500
 and the Philippine guards said that 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.049
 the last time they saw him was 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.269
 Oct. 23, therefore, the authority building 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:44.990
 decision to release the gil and send it 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.210
 at home 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.520
 he probably didn't have any more soldiers 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.440
 spontaneous teleportation experience e 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.900
 that was the only time for his luck 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.340
 since he could teleport 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.230
 in areas of the world that would be 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.270
 be as fatal as the abysses of a 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.460
 ocean by voting for drowning or 

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:04.250
 friends of kilometers from the ground doing it 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:06.440
 precipitate some sources claim that 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.360
 the story has been documented immediately and 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.980
 now be present somewhere in the 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.490
 city police archives 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.230
 Mexico 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:14.720
 others say the fact was 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.010
 told the first time only after 100 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.380
 years happened 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.750
 however without further details e 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.730
 nias lobster and dg perez history is 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.690
 actually happened or is just a story 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.660
 of pure fantasy 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.280
 if all this were confirmed state 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:30.530
 be careful because of your neighbor 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.370
 awakening could find me on the other 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.770
 part of the world 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.400
 if you are lucky in the worst of the 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.140
 hypothesis 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:41.440
 you could and never open again 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:44.750
 eyes for other historical curiosities
