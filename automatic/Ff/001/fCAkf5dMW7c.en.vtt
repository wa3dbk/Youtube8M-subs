using the pen tool and a 3d layer to
create<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:10.260> transition<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.670> was<00:00:11.790> actually

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059

and sorry it took so long for part 3 to
come<00:00:24.480> out<00:00:24.630> I've<00:00:24.869> just<00:00:24.900> been<00:00:25.080> busy<00:00:25.289> with<00:00:25.619> school

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
come out I've just been busy with school

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.400 
come out I've just been busy with school
and<00:00:25.859> midterms<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.640> things<00:00:26.820> like<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.410> but

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
and midterms and things like that but

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.009 
and midterms and things like that but
this<00:00:28.590> is<00:00:28.710> the<00:00:28.830> basic<00:00:28.949> transition<00:00:29.820> on<00:00:30.480> map<00:00:30.869> that

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
this is the basic transition on map that

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.290 
this is the basic transition on map that
hisses<00:00:31.349> quickscoping<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.040> noscope<00:00:32.520> you'll

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
hisses quickscoping this noscope you'll

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.670 
hisses quickscoping this noscope you'll
see<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.630> transition<00:00:34.020> comes<00:00:34.380> through<00:00:34.590> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
see the transition comes through the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.030 
see the transition comes through the
door<00:00:34.730> while<00:00:35.730> we<00:00:35.880> mask<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.840> that's<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.739> basic

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
door while we mask so that's the basic

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.420 
door while we mask so that's the basic
transition<00:00:38.640> so<00:00:39.770> chopping<00:00:40.770> the<00:00:40.860> after<00:00:41.129> effects

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
transition so chopping the after effects

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.979 
transition so chopping the after effects
and<00:00:43.190> have<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.250> clip<00:00:45.090> make<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.420> new<00:00:45.600> composition

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
and have a clip make a new composition

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.459 
and have a clip make a new composition
and<00:00:49.550> all<00:00:50.550> right<00:00:50.730> when<00:00:51.719> we<00:00:51.750> clip<00:00:52.050> right<00:00:52.230> there

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
and all right when we clip right there

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.040 
and all right when we clip right there
I'm<00:00:52.680> just<00:00:53.039> going<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.250> right<00:00:53.460> click<00:00:53.489> right<00:00:53.879> here

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
I'm just going to right click right here

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.889 
I'm just going to right click right here
go<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> time<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.980> matter<00:00:56.160> freeze<00:00:56.550> frame

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
go to time the matter freeze frame

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.630 
go to time the matter freeze frame
simple<00:00:57.899> as<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:57.989> now<00:00:58.469> on<00:00:58.680> mac<00:00:58.980> i<00:00:59.160> think<00:00:59.430> its

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
simple as that now on mac i think its

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.990 
simple as that now on mac i think its
command<00:01:00.270> no<00:01:00.930> Mac<00:01:01.320> its<00:01:01.530> command<00:01:01.559> D<00:01:02.070> on<00:01:02.309> pc<00:01:02.969> i

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
command no Mac its command D on pc i

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.820 
command no Mac its command D on pc i
think<00:01:03.270> its<00:01:03.420> control<00:01:03.809> d<00:01:04.019> just<00:01:04.650> want<00:01:04.769> to

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
think its control d just want to

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.410 
think its control d just want to
duplicate<00:01:04.979> the<00:01:05.369> layer<00:01:05.400> and<00:01:06.119> after<00:01:06.360> you

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
duplicate the layer and after you

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.850 
duplicate the layer and after you
duplicated<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.200> want<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.409> come<00:01:07.530> up<00:01:07.619> here<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
duplicated you want to come up here to

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.590 
duplicated you want to come up here to
the<00:01:08.130> pen<00:01:08.340> tool<00:01:08.369> and<00:01:08.909> if<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.119> don't<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.390> pen

this I'm sure you'll get it to where you
want<00:03:58.350> it<00:03:58.440> to<00:03:58.500> go<00:03:58.709> so<00:03:59.550> the<00:04:00.120> orientation<00:04:00.900> you

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
want it to go so the orientation you

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.350 
want it to go so the orientation you
know<00:04:01.230> is<00:04:01.410> this<00:04:01.620> one<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:02.010> flip<00:04:02.220> it<00:04:02.580> like<00:04:02.760> 3d

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
know is this one you flip it like 3d

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.839 
know is this one you flip it like 3d
light<00:04:03.600> no<00:04:04.590> not<00:04:04.800> really<00:04:04.950> 3d<00:04:05.310> but<00:04:05.519> it<00:04:05.610> kind<00:04:05.790> of

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
light no not really 3d but it kind of

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.170 
light no not really 3d but it kind of
flips<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.569> around<00:04:06.630> like<00:04:06.989> that<00:04:07.200> but<00:04:08.180> really

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
flips it around like that but really

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.990 
flips it around like that but really
don't<00:04:09.269> want<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.690> one<00:04:09.930> so<00:04:10.610> you<00:04:11.610> come<00:04:11.850> over

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000
