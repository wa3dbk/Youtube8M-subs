little bit about why champions like Miss
Fortune<00:00:07.830> have<00:00:08.040> all<00:00:08.220> of<00:00:08.340> these<00:00:08.460> seemingly

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
Fortune have all of these seemingly

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.690 
Fortune have all of these seemingly
random<00:00:09.269> AP<00:00:10.080> scalings<00:00:10.650> on<00:00:10.769> their<00:00:10.920> abilities<00:00:11.429> or

random AP scalings on their abilities or

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.570 
random AP scalings on their abilities or
perhaps<00:00:12.240> why<00:00:12.630> ap<00:00:13.049> Tryndamere<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.769> ap<00:00:14.160> Master

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
perhaps why ap Tryndamere and ap Master

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.630 
perhaps why ap Tryndamere and ap Master
Yi<00:00:14.790> existed<00:00:15.599> in<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.809> first<00:00:16.049> place<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.710> why<00:00:17.340> so

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
Yi existed in the first place and why so

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.519 
Yi existed in the first place and why so
many<00:00:17.880> of<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.150> older<00:00:18.480> champions<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.199> League

well<00:00:24.900> there's<00:00:25.500> actually<00:00:25.710> some<00:00:26.160> pretty

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
well there's actually some pretty

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.939 
well there's actually some pretty
legitimate<00:00:26.910> reasons<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:27.630> them<00:00:27.869> as<00:00:28.140> well

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
legitimate reasons for them as well

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.109 
legitimate reasons for them as well
really<00:00:29.160> quick<00:00:29.460> I<00:00:29.550> want<00:00:29.699> to<00:00:29.760> give<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.880> shout<00:00:30.090> out

curios community I'll be making
community<00:00:35.010> compilations<00:00:35.579> and<00:00:35.730> uploading<00:00:36.120> a

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
new one twice a week so definitely check

new one twice a week so definitely check
it<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.160> anyways<00:00:38.910> let's<00:00:39.270> get<00:00:39.420> started

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
it out anyways let's get started

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.549 
it out anyways let's get started
the<00:00:42.360> main<00:00:42.510> thing<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.809> keep<00:00:42.960> in<00:00:43.079> mind<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.530> that

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
the main thing to keep in mind is that

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.229 
the main thing to keep in mind is that
all<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.309> these<00:00:44.430> champions<00:00:45.030> that<00:00:45.180> have

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
all of these champions that have

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.810 
all of these champions that have
seemingly<00:00:45.809> random<00:00:46.320> scalings<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.010> them<00:00:47.219> are

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
seemingly random scalings on them are

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.420 
seemingly random scalings on them are
quite<00:00:48.450> old<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:49.260> fact<00:00:49.559> pretty<00:00:49.860> much<00:00:49.980> all<00:00:50.280> of

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
quite old in fact pretty much all of

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.310 
quite old in fact pretty much all of
these<00:00:50.579> champions<00:00:50.850> were<00:00:51.180> released<00:00:51.570> in<00:00:51.840> season

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
these champions were released in season

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.680 
these champions were released in season
1<00:00:52.530> or<00:00:52.770> earlier<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.670> that's<00:00:54.120> a<00:00:54.239> really<00:00:54.510> key

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
1 or earlier and that's a really key

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.360 
1 or earlier and that's a really key
factor<00:00:55.140> because<00:00:55.440> when<00:00:55.620> these<00:00:55.800> champions<00:00:56.280> were

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
factor because when these champions were

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.639 
factor because when these champions were
released<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:57.210> League<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> Legends<00:00:57.899> meta<00:00:58.199> did

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
in season 1 would probably laugh at the

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.880 
in season 1 would probably laugh at the
idea<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> meta<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.930> have<00:01:13.080> today<00:01:13.439> despite

idea of the meta we have today despite

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.270 
idea of the meta we have today despite
the<00:01:14.220> game<00:01:14.430> now<00:01:14.670> being<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.270> heavily<00:01:15.570> refined

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
the game now being so heavily refined

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.560 
the game now being so heavily refined
when<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> game<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.670> first<00:01:17.820> coming<00:01:18.240> out<00:01:18.360> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
when a game is first coming out and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.330 
when a game is first coming out and
doesn't<00:01:18.810> have<00:01:19.049> a<00:01:19.080> cut-and-dry<00:01:19.799> meta<00:01:20.070> these

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
doesn't have a cut-and-dry meta these

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.850 
doesn't have a cut-and-dry meta these
random<00:01:20.759> ratios<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.479> scalings<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> really

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
random ratios and scalings are a really

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.070 
random ratios and scalings are a really
good<00:01:23.100> thing<00:01:23.210> because<00:01:24.210> they<00:01:24.360> allow<00:01:24.570> players<00:01:24.869> to

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
good thing because they allow players to

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.660 
good thing because they allow players to
come<00:01:25.229> up<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.500> their<00:01:25.680> own<00:01:25.710> strategies<00:01:26.460> and

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
come up with their own strategies and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.819 
come up with their own strategies and
give<00:01:26.790> them<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.060> lot<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.330> options<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.470> meta<00:01:28.650> was

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
give them a lot of options the meta was

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.560 
give them a lot of options the meta was
so<00:01:29.100> chaotic<00:01:29.460> at<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.790> time<00:01:30.000> that<00:01:30.210> putting

random ratios and hoping for the best in
a<00:01:32.729> kit<00:01:32.970> was<00:01:33.570> definitely<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.170> good<00:01:34.439> idea<00:01:34.829> since

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
a kit was definitely a good idea since

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.160 
a kit was definitely a good idea since
when<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.549> game<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.850> fresh<00:01:36.180> and<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.570> beta<00:01:36.810> still

when the game is fresh and in beta still

when the game is fresh and in beta still
the<00:01:37.680> developers<00:01:38.220> should<00:01:38.520> never<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.329> ones

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
the developers should never be the ones

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.350 
the developers should never be the ones
defining<00:01:40.619> or<00:01:40.799> limiting<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.369> meta<00:01:41.670> until<00:01:42.210> the

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
players come up with something creating

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.429
