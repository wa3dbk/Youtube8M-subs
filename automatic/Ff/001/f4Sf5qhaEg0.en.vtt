your restaurant like this I have created
some<00:01:07.240> of<00:01:07.270> the<00:01:07.420> products<00:01:07.990> we<00:01:08.619> will<00:01:08.770> switch<00:01:09.070> to

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
some of the products we will switch to

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.240 
some of the products we will switch to
the<00:01:09.490> point<00:01:09.729> of<00:01:09.880> sale<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.780> see<00:01:10.960> how<00:01:11.800> the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
the point of sale to see how the

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.330 
the point of sale to see how the
point-of-sale<00:01:12.700> functions<00:01:13.600> in<00:01:14.340> restoring

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
point-of-sale functions in restoring

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:18.810 
point-of-sale functions in restoring
environment<00:01:16.060> so<00:01:17.020> the<00:01:17.320> very<00:01:17.500> first<00:01:17.620> screen<00:01:18.220> is

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
environment so the very first screen is

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:22.680 
environment so the very first screen is
about<00:01:19.330> the<00:01:19.510> selection<00:01:19.690> of<00:01:20.460> tables<00:01:21.460> so<00:01:22.180> the

about the selection of tables so the

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.570 
about the selection of tables so the

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:24.580 
system will show all the available

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.460 
system will show all the available
tables<00:01:26.160> so<00:01:27.160> that<00:01:27.190> a<00:01:27.760> waiter<00:01:28.450> can<00:01:28.840> book<00:01:29.260> an

tables so that a waiter can book an
order<00:01:30.100> against<00:01:30.580> it<00:01:30.730> so<00:01:31.540> for<00:01:31.720> example<00:01:31.840> i<00:01:32.350> just

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
order against it so for example i just

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:36.600 
order against it so for example i just
select<00:01:32.830> one<00:01:33.280> table<00:01:33.670> 2<00:01:33.910> and<00:01:34.180> click<00:01:35.140> ok<00:01:35.560> it<00:01:36.400> will

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
select one table 2 and click ok it will

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.180 
select one table 2 and click ok it will
be<00:01:36.730> shown<00:01:36.940> at<00:01:37.270> the<00:01:37.300> top<00:01:37.420> of<00:01:37.630> the<00:01:37.960> screen

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:38.190 
be shown at the top of the screen

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:41.390 
be shown at the top of the screen
simultaneously<00:01:39.190> you<00:01:39.970> can<00:01:40.210> have<00:01:40.450> multiple

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
simultaneously you can have multiple

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.720 
simultaneously you can have multiple
tables<00:01:42.400> running<00:01:43.180> at<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.390> time<00:01:43.780> so<00:01:44.620> here<00:01:45.190> the<00:01:45.460> two

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
tables running at a time so here the two

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.090 
tables running at a time so here the two
table<00:01:46.240> 2<00:01:46.450> will<00:01:46.750> not<00:01:46.990> be<00:01:47.230> available<00:01:47.500> since<00:01:47.920> it

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
table 2 will not be available since it

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.020 
table 2 will not be available since it
is<00:01:48.220> already<00:01:48.400> booked<00:01:49.110> now<00:01:50.110> here<00:01:50.500> I<00:01:50.680> can<00:01:51.100> Club

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
is already booked now here I can Club

is already booked now here I can Club
two<00:01:52.659> tables<00:01:53.200> at<00:01:53.380> a<00:01:53.440> time<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:56.290> you<00:01:56.860> can<00:01:57.070> see<00:01:57.250> here

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
two tables at a time so you can see here

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.090 
two tables at a time so you can see here
table<00:01:57.880> 3<00:01:58.090> and<00:01:58.270> table<00:01:58.420> for<00:01:58.810> are<00:01:59.020> there<00:01:59.620> which

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
table 3 and table for are there which

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.770 
table 3 and table for are there which
will<00:02:00.280> have<00:02:00.550> a<00:02:00.760> same<00:02:01.500> table<00:02:02.500> order<00:02:02.860> now<00:02:03.700> I<00:02:03.970> can

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
will have a same table order now I can

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.639 
will have a same table order now I can
place<00:02:05.530> some<00:02:05.560> order<00:02:06.370> for<00:02:06.610> Table<00:02:06.850> one<00:02:07.470> let's<00:02:08.470> say

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
place some order for Table one let's say

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.699 
place some order for Table one let's say
and<00:02:09.769> I<00:02:10.039> can<00:02:10.459> generate<00:02:10.879> k<00:02:11.299> ot<00:02:11.420> for<00:02:11.810> it<00:02:11.989> so<00:02:12.379> the

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
and I can generate k ot for it so the

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.280 
and I can generate k ot for it so the
system<00:02:13.099> will<00:02:13.280> show<00:02:13.640> a<00:02:13.849> pop-up<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:14.840> coyote

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
system will show a pop-up that coyote

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.759 
system will show a pop-up that coyote
has<00:02:15.409> been<00:02:15.470> generated<00:02:16.540> in<00:02:17.540> a<00:02:17.870> very<00:02:18.170> next<00:02:18.470> tab

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
has been generated in a very next tab

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:21.130 
has been generated in a very next tab
I'll<00:02:19.340> just<00:02:19.670> show<00:02:19.879> you<00:02:19.909> the<00:02:20.209> coyote<00:02:20.720> what<00:02:20.959> has

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
I'll just show you the coyote what has

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:28.869 
I'll just show you the coyote what has
generated<00:02:21.560> through<00:02:22.459> that<00:02:23.060> POS<00:02:23.930> order<00:02:27.459> so<00:02:28.459> this

00:02:28.869 --> 00:02:28.879 
generated through that POS order so this

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:32.319 
generated through that POS order so this
is<00:02:29.060> a<00:02:29.209> restaurant<00:02:29.540> module<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:31.090> here<00:02:32.090> is<00:02:32.299> a

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.329 
is a restaurant module and here is a

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.220 

so<00:02:45.310> at<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.610> bottom<00:02:46.030> you<00:02:46.330> will<00:02:46.360> find<00:02:46.780> the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
so at the bottom you will find the

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.590 
so at the bottom you will find the
coyote<00:02:47.740> which<00:02:47.980> is<00:02:48.130> in<00:02:48.280> draft<00:02:48.610> mode<00:02:48.790> you<00:02:49.570> can

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
coyote which is in draft mode you can

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.250 
coyote which is in draft mode you can
see<00:02:50.050> there<00:02:50.290> is<00:02:50.470> order<00:02:50.830> reference<00:02:51.400> so<00:02:52.330> we<00:02:53.050> can

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
see there is order reference so we can

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.880 
see there is order reference so we can
have<00:02:53.530> a<00:02:53.770> Quixote<00:02:54.460> here<00:02:55.140> the<00:02:56.140> Quixote<00:02:56.620> is
