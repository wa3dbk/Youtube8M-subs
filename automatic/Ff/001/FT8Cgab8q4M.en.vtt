this<00:02:25.250> oh

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.350 

right<00:02:31.370> here<00:02:31.610> I<00:02:31.820> don't<00:02:31.970> know<00:02:32.060> if<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:32.210> guys<00:02:32.300> can

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
right here I don't know if you guys can

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.110 
right here I don't know if you guys can
see<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.960> says<00:02:33.610> for<00:02:34.610> use<00:02:34.820> with<00:02:35.030> your

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
see that it says for use with your

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.910 
see that it says for use with your
thunderbolt<00:02:35.660> display<00:02:35.720> and<00:02:36.230> mac<00:02:36.440> with<00:02:36.710> mac

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
thunderbolt display and mac with mac

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.740 
thunderbolt display and mac with mac
safe<00:02:37.160> too<00:02:38.140> so<00:02:39.140> I<00:02:39.170> guess<00:02:39.290> it's<00:02:39.560> an<00:02:39.680> adapter<00:02:40.750> for

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
safe too so I guess it's an adapter for

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.570 
safe too so I guess it's an adapter for
the<00:02:42.440> newer<00:02:42.860> macbook<00:02:43.760> air<00:02:44.030> and<00:02:44.480> macbook<00:02:44.720> pros

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
the newer macbook air and macbook pros

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.130 
the newer macbook air and macbook pros

mandra<00:05:50.139> you<00:05:50.380> expect<00:05:51.030> maybe<00:05:52.030> others<00:05:52.300> too<00:05:52.570> but

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
mandra you expect maybe others too but

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.640 
mandra you expect maybe others too but
you<00:05:54.760> are<00:05:54.909> any<00:05:55.479> time<00:05:55.690> you<00:05:55.780> connect<00:05:56.050> anything<00:05:56.260> to

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:56.650 
you are any time you connect anything to

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.399 
you are any time you connect anything to
any<00:05:57.610> time<00:05:57.880> you<00:05:58.000> daisy<00:05:58.210> chain<00:05:58.539> your<00:05:59.050> monitor
