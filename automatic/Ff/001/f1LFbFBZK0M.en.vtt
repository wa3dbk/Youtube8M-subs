00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.749
 and the verdict was the expected

 a failure 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:28.300

 Impressionism proposed to capture the impact of light and colors in a 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.680
 determined moment 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.450
 in this sense his greatest enemy was not the academies and his works 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.590
 classified 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.710

 With these can they paint the chains that broke the 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.370
 team 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.890
 to express themselves in their purest form 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.870

 the debut of impressionism in the unofficial exhibition of 1874 

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:26.879
 it was not a spontaneous phenomenon 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.049
 but the culmination of the arch effort to materialize the light in the paintings

 ideal for the game of lights and shadows 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.849
 a second defends painters came to finish the anti-academic revolution 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:56.249

 aesthetic conditioning 

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:07.849
 and endowing them with an intrepid subjectivity 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:10.879
