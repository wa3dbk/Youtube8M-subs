this<00:00:33.210> guy<00:00:33.390> this<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.620> new<00:00:34.800> ipad<00:00:35.250> /<00:00:35.430> ipad<00:00:35.940> 2

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
this guy this is the new ipad / ipad 2

this guy this is the new ipad / ipad 2
omni<00:00:36.930> cover<00:00:37.170> case<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.770> this<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.100> black<00:00:38.340> carbon

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
omni cover case and this is black carbon

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.330 
omni cover case and this is black carbon
fiber<00:00:39.030> texture<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.170> i<00:00:40.469> think<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:40.860> may<00:00:41.010> even<00:00:41.040> be

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
fiber texture and i think it may even be

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.389 
fiber texture and i think it may even be
carbon<00:00:41.850> fiber<00:00:42.059> i'm<00:00:42.510> not<00:00:42.840> too<00:00:43.230> sure<00:00:43.260> but<00:00:44.190> i

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
carbon fiber i'm not too sure but i

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.510 
carbon fiber i'm not too sure but i
think<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:45.149> might<00:00:45.539> be<00:00:45.770> it<00:00:46.770> would<00:00:46.950> probably<00:00:47.280> say

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
think it might be it would probably say

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.430 
think it might be it would probably say
carbon<00:00:47.879> fiber<00:00:48.120> for<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.450> reason<00:00:48.960> besides<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
carbon fiber for a reason besides the

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.340 
carbon fiber for a reason besides the
fact<00:00:49.590> that<00:00:49.739> looks<00:00:50.070> like<00:00:50.190> carbon<00:00:50.489> fiber<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.750> it

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
fact that looks like carbon fiber and it

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.869 
fact that looks like carbon fiber and it
probably<00:00:52.590> feels<00:00:52.829> a<00:00:53.010> little<00:00:53.160> bit<00:00:53.340> harder<00:00:53.670> like

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
probably feels a little bit harder like

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.299 
probably feels a little bit harder like
carbon<00:00:54.270> fiber<00:00:54.510> so<00:00:55.079> there's<00:00:55.800> really<00:00:55.920> nothing

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
carbon fiber so there's really nothing

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.549 
carbon fiber so there's really nothing
on<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.640> front<00:00:57.000> besides<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:57.809> little<00:00:58.050> QR<00:00:58.350> code

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
on the front besides the little QR code

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.229 
on the front besides the little QR code
which<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.980> guys<00:00:59.190> can<00:00:59.399> go<00:00:59.520> ahead<00:00:59.640> and<00:00:59.789> scan

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
which you guys can go ahead and scan

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.939 
which you guys can go ahead and scan
that<00:01:00.449> right<00:01:00.780> now<00:01:00.960> i'll<00:01:01.500> give<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.710> a<00:01:01.800> couple

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that right now i'll give you a couple

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.740 
that right now i'll give you a couple
seconds<00:01:02.430> or<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.969> a<00:01:03.000> matter<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.300> fact<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.600> guys

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
seconds or as a matter of fact you guys

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.649 
seconds or as a matter of fact you guys
can<00:01:03.930> just<00:01:04.110> go<00:01:04.619> pause<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.189> video<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:06.090> that's

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
can just go pause the video but that's

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.510 
can just go pause the video but that's
basically<00:01:06.869> for<00:01:07.320> their<00:01:07.470> protective<00:01:08.280> case<00:01:08.490> for

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
basically for their protective case for

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.280 
basically for their protective case for
tablets<00:01:09.150> fits<00:01:09.360> up<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.510> 10<00:01:09.750> inch<00:01:09.900> tablets

providing<00:01:10.890> inspiration<00:01:11.100> casecrown<00:01:12.470> this<00:01:13.470> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
providing inspiration casecrown this is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.560 
providing inspiration casecrown this is
just<00:01:13.770> a<00:01:13.830> little<00:01:13.950> bio<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.790> case<00:01:15.180> crown<00:01:15.390> on<00:01:15.479> the

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
just a little bio of case crown on the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.969 
just a little bio of case crown on the
back<00:01:15.750> so<00:01:15.900> there's<00:01:16.049> really<00:01:16.140> nothing<00:01:16.530> important

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
back so there's really nothing important

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.890 
back so there's really nothing important
over<00:01:17.159> there<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:18.240> let's<00:01:18.390> just<00:01:18.509> open<00:01:18.659> this

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
over there and so let's just open this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.510 
over there and so let's just open this
up<00:01:19.080> there's<00:01:19.320> some<00:01:19.439> tape<00:01:19.680> over<00:01:20.070> here<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:20.369> let's

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
up there's some tape over here so let's

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.880 
up there's some tape over here so let's
pull<00:01:21.210> that<00:01:21.479> off<00:01:22.790> got<00:01:23.790> that<00:01:23.939> off<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.770> on<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
pull that off got that off and on the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.800 
pull that off got that off and on the
inside<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.729> should<00:01:27.000> see<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.540> meat<00:01:27.689> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
inside we should see the meat and

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.310 
inside we should see the meat and
potatoes<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:28.259> this<00:01:28.409> package<00:01:28.799> which<00:01:29.460> would<00:01:29.790> be

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
potatoes of this package which would be

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.679 
potatoes of this package which would be
the<00:01:31.320> actual<00:01:31.530> case<00:01:31.979> itself<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.509> cake

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the actual case itself and the cake

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.880 
the actual case itself and the cake
yourself<00:01:34.020> comes<00:01:34.200> in<00:01:34.320> this<00:01:34.409> little<00:01:34.470> plastic

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
yourself comes in this little plastic

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.270 
yourself comes in this little plastic
thing<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:35.520> let's<00:01:35.700> get<00:01:36.299> it<00:01:36.420> out<00:01:36.540> of<00:01:36.600> there<00:01:36.840> and

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
thing so let's get it out of there and

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.740 
thing so let's get it out of there and
has<00:01:38.280> some<00:01:38.579> nice<00:01:38.700> protective<00:01:39.000> foam<00:01:39.390> counting

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
has some nice protective foam counting

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.990 
has some nice protective foam counting
on<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.930> inside<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.100> it<00:01:41.250> doesn't<00:01:41.490> get<00:01:41.549> damaged

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
on the inside so it doesn't get damaged

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.240 
on the inside so it doesn't get damaged
during<00:01:42.090> transportation<00:01:42.570> and<00:01:43.170> let's<00:01:43.979> open

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
during transportation and let's open

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.160 
during transportation and let's open
this<00:01:44.399> guy<00:01:44.610> up<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:45.090> take<00:01:45.720> out<00:01:45.899> this<00:01:46.020> little

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
this guy up and take out this little

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.980 
this guy up and take out this little
foam<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.710> check<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.220> guy<00:01:47.430> out<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:48.450> far<00:01:48.750> can

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
foam and check this guy out so far can

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.719 
foam and check this guy out so far can
tell<00:01:49.290> you<00:01:49.380> anything<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:50.220> actually<00:01:50.610> feels

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
tell you anything this actually feels

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.690 
tell you anything this actually feels
really<00:01:50.909> nice<00:01:51.799> this<00:01:52.799> feels<00:01:53.009> nicer<00:01:53.369> than<00:01:53.490> some

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
really nice this feels nicer than some
