five<00:00:01.380> year<00:00:01.560> old<00:00:02.540> this<00:00:03.540> is<00:00:03.600> the<00:00:05.420> the<00:00:06.420> circuit

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
five year old this is the the circuit

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.030 
five year old this is the the circuit
when<00:00:07.049> I'm<00:00:07.170> using<00:00:07.319> right<00:00:07.649> now

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
when I'm using right now

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.770 
when I'm using right now
and<00:00:08.929> I<00:00:09.929> got<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.500> from<00:00:10.769> John<00:00:11.340> Carr<00:00:11.670> 44<00:00:12.570> for

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
and I got this from John Carr 44 for

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.900 
and I got this from John Carr 44 for
Scylla<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:13.259> think<00:00:13.920> he<00:00:14.070> was<00:00:14.219> getting<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.639> from

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
Scylla I think he was getting it from

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.380 
Scylla I think he was getting it from

that's<00:02:55.900> what<00:02:56.260> happens<00:02:56.620> I<00:02:56.950> have<00:02:58.110> guests<00:02:59.110> me<00:02:59.260> in

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
that's what happens I have guests me in

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:17.539 
that's what happens I have guests me in
war<00:02:59.980> I'm<00:03:00.129> here<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.690> I<00:03:02.200> show<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.620> to<00:03:02.680> you<00:03:02.860> ladies

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.800 

okay

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
okay

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.670 
okay
let's<00:03:20.440> see<00:03:20.620> what<00:03:20.740> happens<00:03:22.230> so<00:03:23.230> I'm<00:03:23.290> guessing

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
let's see what happens so I'm guessing

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:33.360 
let's see what happens so I'm guessing
we<00:03:23.709> on<00:03:23.860> this<00:03:24.010> walk<00:03:31.440> doesn't<00:03:32.440> even<00:03:32.770> the<00:03:32.920> jump

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
we on this walk doesn't even the jump

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.190 
we on this walk doesn't even the jump
ring<00:03:33.730> has<00:03:34.150> got<00:03:34.240> something

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
ring has got something

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.090 
ring has got something
I<00:03:36.230> don't<00:03:36.770> wanna<00:03:37.010> try<00:03:37.220> water<00:03:37.520> okay<00:03:38.680> that's<00:03:39.680> done

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:40.100 
I don't wanna try water okay that's done

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:44.280 
I don't wanna try water okay that's done
this<00:03:40.340> Python

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:44.290 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.680 

by<00:03:44.800> doing<00:03:44.860> that<00:03:45.190> I<00:03:45.520> just<00:03:45.550> turned<00:03:46.239> on<00:03:46.480> my

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
by doing that I just turned on my

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.800 
by doing that I just turned on my
circuit

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
circuit

00:03:48.810 --> 00:04:03.380 
circuit
let's<00:03:49.140> see<00:04:00.770> and<00:04:01.770> it<00:04:01.890> misfires<00:04:02.100> I<00:04:02.819> think<00:04:03.300> that

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
let's see and it misfires I think that

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:06.970 
let's see and it misfires I think that
isn't<00:04:03.540> because<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:04.970> just<00:04:05.970> did<00:04:06.120> this<00:04:06.239> bar<00:04:06.569> get

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
isn't because I just did this bar get

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.930 
isn't because I just did this bar get
really<00:04:07.980> big<00:04:08.540> okay<00:04:09.680> let's<00:04:10.680> put<00:04:11.040> some<00:04:11.370> gasoline

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
really big okay let's put some gasoline

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:24.340 
really big okay let's put some gasoline
again

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.040 

the<00:04:25.350> gasoline<00:04:25.770> it<00:04:26.580> doesn't<00:04:27.030> really<00:04:27.390> wants<00:04:27.870> to

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
the gasoline it doesn't really wants to

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:31.310 
the gasoline it doesn't really wants to
work<00:04:28.320> really<00:04:28.650> good<00:04:29.780> again<00:04:30.780> this<00:04:30.960> might<00:04:31.170> be

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 
work really good again this might be

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.320 
work really good again this might be
there

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.480 

because<00:04:35.050> the<00:04:35.169> spawn<00:04:35.409> game

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
because the spawn game

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:45.570 
because the spawn game
let's<00:04:36.850> see<00:04:37.030> what<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:43.740> love<00:04:44.740> it's<00:04:45.190> much<00:04:45.400> more

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
let's see what I love it's much more

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.540 
let's see what I love it's much more
consistently<00:04:46.360> water

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
consistently water

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.000 
consistently water
then

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
then

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:55.850 
then
more<00:04:51.550> hanging

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.379 

yep

00:04:59.379 --> 00:04:59.389 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:03.029 

it's<00:05:00.389> who<00:05:00.810> I<00:05:00.949> dutifully

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
it's who I dutifully

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:13.709 
it's who I dutifully
let's<00:05:03.610> burn<00:05:03.969> them<00:05:04.150> off

00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:13.719 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:17.170 

yep

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.960 

it's<00:05:18.180> true<00:05:18.420> justice<00:05:18.930> hi

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.780 

okay<00:05:22.570> I<00:05:22.960> think<00:05:23.710> I<00:05:23.890> showed<00:05:24.130> you<00:05:24.280> everything<00:05:24.370> I

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
okay I think I showed you everything I

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.040 
okay I think I showed you everything I
wanted<00:05:25.030> to<00:05:25.150> show<00:05:25.330> in<00:05:25.450> this<00:05:25.540> video

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.629 

and<00:05:28.410> set<00:05:28.710> out<00:05:28.889> a<00:05:28.919> little<00:05:29.160> more<00:05:29.400> time

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:32.639 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.149

the<00:05:35.999> spark<00:05:36.449> to<00:05:36.899> his

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
the spark to his

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:45.020 
the spark to his
laughing<00:05:39.650> glass

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:57.390 

that<00:05:45.150> can<00:05:45.330> hold<00:05:45.600> him<00:05:46.020> and<00:05:46.590> the<00:05:46.770> glass

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:08.470 

and<00:05:58.400> I<00:05:58.490> put<00:05:58.699> some<00:05:58.729> water

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:08.480 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:17.190 

or

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200 

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:29.610 

guess

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:29.620 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.370 

whereas<00:06:30.620> I<00:06:30.710> can't<00:06:31.010> hold<00:06:31.880> on<00:06:32.030> guess<00:06:32.300> makes<00:06:33.050> the

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.380 
whereas I can't hold on guess makes the

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.570 
whereas I can't hold on guess makes the
same<00:06:33.620> amount<00:06:33.770> of<00:06:34.040> bank

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 
same amount of bank

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.439 
same amount of bank
it<00:06:36.060> flew<00:06:36.360> is<00:06:36.419> the<00:06:36.630> cap<00:06:36.870> in<00:06:37.349> the<00:06:37.470> same<00:06:37.710> height

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:38.449 
it flew is the cap in the same height

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:42.879 
it flew is the cap in the same height
show<00:06:39.479> so<00:06:40.080> it's<00:06:40.380> sugar<00:06:41.340> spine<00:06:41.729> same<00:06:42.120> way

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:42.889 
show so it's sugar spine same way

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:51.479 
this is before once in there I think I

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:54.460 
this is before once in there I think I
find<00:06:51.780> out<00:06:51.930> the<00:06:52.050> very<00:06:52.229> hard<00:06:52.470> to<00:06:52.590> do<00:06:52.710> it

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:54.470 
find out the very hard to do it

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:57.130 
find out the very hard to do it

00:06:57.130 --> 00:06:57.140 
for morning ones under engine I'm going
