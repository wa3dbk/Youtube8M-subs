00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:13.799
 the ability to beautifully shoot a pistol 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.809
 we often meet video projections 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.050
 film strip on a white screen we hear 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.289
 shots through the speakers 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.900
 multichannel sound systems 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.760
 we have this movie but we and the people who own 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.730
 similar to Latin saving lives 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:27.930
 they worked with pessimism 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.369
 soviet internal organs see 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:31.820
 was in nkvd 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.730
 and I suspect that 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:35.980
 in the thirties 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.910
 in nkvd system were developed 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:39.440
 special techniques that we are now 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.800
 conditionally call technicians mixed 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.950
 pendulum 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.880
 single comment 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.630
 a reminder of these appliances 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.820
 artistic bit but it seems in 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.790
 the fourth 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.550
 Well, she gives birth to enough 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:52.790
 so many 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:53.770
 contradictions 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.140
 disputes and so on 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.560
 why then how would you like the novel itself 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.430
 maintain the conditions of the documentary 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.850
 many documents 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.799
 percent 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:03.859
 many specifics and promptly investigative 

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.489
 activities and here at force 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.250
 detention 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.150
 I think a group of opponents friend goes 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.610
 what is the Russian team there 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.960
 what is the deviation from the bullets and so on 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.000
 need to consider that I would understand 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.570
 Alas, no one ever spoke because he 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:19.950
 in the simplest math 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.790
 payment 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.899
 bullet speed 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:23.669
 and the speed of a person moving there fast 

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:25.609
 current summer that from a bullet to run away 

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:26.390
 can't 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.240
 why is the husband 4 glasses small 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.659
 distance he gets for example on 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:33.560
 two centimeters spent liverpool and 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.320
 everything 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.329
 it was about leaving 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.189
 gradually the arrow at the moment of pressing 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.780
 trigger 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.479
 I really from reality in that 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.420
 to Egypt where this should be 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.030
 the museum 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.460
 the best in the end his price wins one 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.830
 parties and here not sparing myself according to 

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:50.409
 fight with use handguns to 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:53.030
 combinations of seconds when testing private 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.490
 security companies 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.119
 and noticed that he 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.240
 m guards who served Moscow where 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.920
 then what might even power 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:00.840
 structures 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.550
 n but not shot long enough 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.580
 first shot after 3 4 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.580
 seconds after signal mystery 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:12.329
 second moment of self withdrawal of weapons 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:14.559
 subsequent processing of Ukraine 

00:02:14.559 --> 00:02:16.669
 not done too 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.239
 in any champions 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:19.549
 but requires a certain 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:20.020
 of time 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:21.679
 all this time 

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:24.659
 remains yours and you can maneuvered 

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:25.840
 open fire 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:28.519
 to kill and exit the pallet in which 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:29.339
 shoots 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:32.509
 that is, still vintage we dodge no field 

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:35.509
 but bow to the island like his knives 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:39.469
 I am already a nation that depends on him 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.589
 Yeltsin 

00:02:41.589 --> 00:02:42.630
 average workout 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.000
 pouring poorly trained like 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.749
 fast bow 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.259
 the main becomes defenseless 

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:49.949
 before well prepared 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:52.169
 Turkey has achieved a draw 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:53.309
 near important to remember 

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:54.719
 he is not a weapon 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.879
 he has a man who gives him money 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:02:58.559
 if dodging a flying bullet 

00:02:58.559 --> 00:03:00.419
 physically 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.279
 chances to predict the movements of who 

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:04.839
 presses the trigger on June 9th technology 

00:03:04.839 --> 00:03:06.229
 were he still 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:09.229
 taken 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:12.749
 the beginning of this century 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.329
 some 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:17.339
 but collision with a gunshot 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:18.439
 arms somewhat constrained 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.119
 processed you can think of methods 

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:23.400
 counter the situation again what does 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.299
 self defense when you are surprised 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.809
 fall and must be protected by this 

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.809
 situations when let's say 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.869
 military personnel either 

00:03:33.869 --> 00:03:35.099
 ha law enforcement officer 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:36.729
 forced to act 1 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:39.259
 looking around like rooms like this 

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:41.219
 do it right how to leave diminishing 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.479
 the threat of hiding how to shoot movements 

00:03:43.479 --> 00:03:46.239
 all these moments in these technicians are enough 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.549
 disassembled in detail 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.909
 the nice thing is that it is for 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:51.909
 developments turkish and require pen a little 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:53.059
 there is still higher 

00:03:53.059 --> 00:03:56.059
 and the ability to work with weapons idling 

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:58.749
 that is, it does not require a large number 

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:00.659
 ammunition associated primarily with the 

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:01.469
 what 

00:04:01.469 --> 00:04:04.419
 and the return outside those years was not very 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:05.400
 strong 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.139
 but political 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.259
 It is worth remembering the financier in the summer 

00:04:09.259 --> 00:04:11.879
 two hands modern us reality she 

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:13.699
 can be used except when shooting 

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:15.879
 motion picture team and hero Kurchenko 

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:18.259
 noticed during the flight in the car 

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:20.870
 nothing is foreseen in football 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.199
 in practice the need 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:22.800
 to think 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.930
 he was justified by a small number of rounds 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.759
 lagoon of a single gun 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:28.759
 and it was possible exclusively 

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:31.300
 thanks to a small recoil but in 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.930
 modern life certainly he is no longer 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:34.960
 uses the connection so that vaccinations 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.889
 have become this omen which 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:38.360
 completely cover those 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.729
 tactical tasks which 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.529
 affliction happy two hands appeared 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.110
 modern pistol with us 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.340
 charger which does not require 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.289
 additional 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:51.569
 no resource as cleverly sectors gun 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.129
 others recharge continue to fire 

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:55.960
 it will be both more accurate and faster 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.650
 but at one time when we were just kicking 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.319
 when were the gun 

00:05:01.319 --> 00:05:03.529
 it was very effective and very 

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:06.529
 traumatic way of working against the group 

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:26.400
 Macedonian shooting technique 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.029
 value applied 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.039
 the English at the beginning of the last century 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:31.800
 it was designed specifically for 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.509
 then weapons that is it was 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:35.529
 pistols 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:37.229
 remove tires with handles 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.680
 it was easy to bear 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.699
 these were pistols pulsed again 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:41.819
 weak patron 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:44.729
 it was a small gun wasp 

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.800
 but if the store's large capacity is either 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:47.770
 drum 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.550
 correspondingly double the amount 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:53.300
 MMK's right ammunition allowed to break through 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.259
 through tight enough damper on 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.159
 Macedonian and here there is one two 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.169
 name decoding option 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:00.419
 the first is 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:03.119
 cutting of paper in Omsk 

00:06:03.119 --> 00:06:05.569
 Well, the second option is that he knows the first 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:07.389
 this is the volume started to be applied 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:08.889
 Macedonian terrorist 

00:06:08.889 --> 00:06:09.960
 in groups 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.830
 in modern conditions like 

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:13.139
 shooting method practically 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:14.289
 not applicable 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:16.939
 firstly because he is the majority 

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:19.770
 servicemen in this case of law and order 

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:21.949
 only one pistol second then 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:23.720
 that right now developed a large number 

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:25.159
 machine gun 

00:06:25.159 --> 00:06:27.229
 ap pistol with increased capacity 

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:29.639
 he would stock there 18 rounds and even 

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:30.639
 more 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:32.780
 accordingly, ammunition is not 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.710
 such important characteristics 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:37.370
 upon breakthrough according to 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.310
 needs nevertheless such a method 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:41.199
 would have existed successfully 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:41.819
 was used
