00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.580
 there is the connecting link between 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.369
 producer and fashion brands on the one hand 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.750

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.640
 on the other hand goods from ours 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.040
 Customers are being in Asia 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.610
 produced and come in containers to 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.890
 are processed by us or 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.680
 edit your la meter say 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.449
 goods for retail are on 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.330
 clothes hangers are hung 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.190
 being steamed is labeled only 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.080
 logistics services 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.530
 sort and actual 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.629
 Goods for retail become the US 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.350
 inc is my lying on the ground 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:57.769
 location and as people 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.420
 consumers place an order on the internet 

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.360
 places then those orders arrive 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.379
 us start and it becomes us 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.379
 delivered to the consumer 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.740
 the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.530
 why us 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.790
 have been deployed in the new market 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.060
 is actually very logical you have to 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.859
 proposals and 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.009
 experience the meadow in a traditional way 

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:33.200
 the reed growers no may be clear 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.030
 that this makes at the moment certainly in the 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.090
 fashion industry is not easily gone 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.299
 you can see the volumes falling back in 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.000
 inretail lamb means that we like there 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:45.979
 as a logistics service provider 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.299
 not help that our feeling is it 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.039
 naturally also decrease 

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:52.100
 of course we have five years 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.289
 ago we saw that trend emerge 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.450
 we already responded to that by then 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.799
 first go a high degree 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.310
 otherwise you can automate this 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.039
 processes do not follow and during these times 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.509
 times of crisis that there is a group that 

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:09.530
 from three quarters of our company 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.630
 At Build we have been in in in five years 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.530
 time 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:13.960
 we actually have a new one 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.700
 developed a market in which we are the latest 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.040
 three years and with it the whole 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.980
 services, in particular the 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.740
 web shops 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.810
 Have created 45% new sales 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.620
 in three years time has not had relative 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.620
 I think
