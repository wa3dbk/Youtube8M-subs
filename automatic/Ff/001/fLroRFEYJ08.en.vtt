00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.429
 This half year was certainly one 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:17.000
 uphill and downhill if you are completely honest 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.259
 it was a whole year 2014 one 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.869
 real mountain and descent 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:22.640
 Why did you say simple things ? 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.130
 Of course, you can not be satisfied too 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.439
 if he gives us the victory against celtic 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.939
 now also quite respectable 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:32.060
 and good starting position for the early 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.170
 have created as sixth half 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.059
 complete the season 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.199
 that is not the claim of austria 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:39.350
 You can not be satisfied there 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:41.079
 but I think we still have it 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.160
 said with the victory against grödig 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.010
 at least for us an initial position 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.199
 really created with that earlier 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.219
 can attack 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:52.670
 as is the winter break 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.079
 traditional on the one hand always very active 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.090
 transfer activity approach 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.879
 what must I do and what will change in the 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.410
 earlier I think we always have 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.750
 We said after every half season 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:04.760
 a proper analysis does that 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.580
 We will be like that in the next week 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:08.960
 make the player have two to 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.240
 Holiday really deserves and son now 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.890
 really sure three weeks 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.910
 recover physically and mentally and 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.650
 regenerate 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.200
 Of course, there will be one in the board 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.060
 There are many points that make analysis 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.540
 where we put at those years 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.810
 have to 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.920
 Of course we have to do a lot of things 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.160
 very critical 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.560
 But that's our job and then that 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.450
 to find the right measures for you 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.250
 initiate 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.020
 but as I said it was me 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.660
 bit conciliatory is right to the end 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.580
 that we are always against grödig where it always 

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.530
 traditionally very hard for it 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.990
 austria vienna is not an opponent of us 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.270
 really is a very important one 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.560
 so have retracted victorious us 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.960
 a starting position for the early 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.790
 have created the hope that gives 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.560
 we still have our goals, namely the 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.530
 Qualification of international competition 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.810
 can forget to pay 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.910
 of course partly the coach massive 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.470
 criticism from the trainer always the back 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:06.080
 strengthened that remains now in the 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.569
 winter break absolutely always knew me 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.679
 that the coach has a difficult job 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.819
 That's not just a coach change 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.459
 wash and that we too one 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.959
 We want to initiate a system change 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.090
 seen that maybe not in that 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:20.010
 pace as we imagine 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.650
 we have the cadre already in the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.629
 rebuilt last summer 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.359
 New engagements brought these but 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.769
 further development of the cadre will also 

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.819
 have to go further that's at all 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.569
 no question 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.010
 and i just think baumgartner did 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.510
 also a very hard half year 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:41.400
 austria vienna is very clear 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.159
 if you already have club austria wien to us 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.840
 Yesterday then you just have others 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.859
 claims than its previous ones 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.549
 stations 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:52.739
 but I think he also proved in 

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:55.319
 this difficult phase that he very much 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.510
 Meticulously very precise 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:01.019
 he works that necessarily this 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:02.400
 wants to succeed and therefore we are 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.889
 but also very happy and I am happy 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.569
 also personally for him that we now 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.519
 we are also in a position where we are 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.120
 have a chance earlier 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.120
 to achieve our goals
