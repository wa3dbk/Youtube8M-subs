00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.400 

and<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:48.000> autofocus<00:02:48.390> pattern<00:02:48.930> sorry<00:02:49.140> and

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
and the the autofocus pattern sorry and

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.590 
and the the autofocus pattern sorry and
the<00:02:49.590> autofocus<00:02:49.950> type<00:02:50.340> single<00:02:50.610> continuous<00:02:51.360> and

the autofocus type single continuous and

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.940 
the autofocus type single continuous and
is<00:02:52.350> auto<00:02:52.650> tracking<00:02:53.750> 51<00:02:54.750> points<00:02:55.080> 21<00:02:55.500> points

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
is auto tracking 51 points 21 points

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.390 
is auto tracking 51 points 21 points
nine<00:02:56.220> points<00:02:56.640> and<00:02:56.840> single<00:02:57.840> single<00:02:58.290> point<00:02:58.470> okay

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
nine points and single single point okay

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.000 
nine points and single single point okay
so<00:02:59.580> these<00:03:00.300> are<00:03:00.510> the<00:03:00.570> controls<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.680> we<00:03:01.890> have

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
so these are the controls that we have

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.490 
so these are the controls that we have
carried<00:03:02.400> over<00:03:02.490> from<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:02.910> world<00:03:03.060> like<00:03:03.500> d7000

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
carried over from the world like d7000

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.010 
carried over from the world like d7000
and<00:03:04.650> which<00:03:05.160> will<00:03:05.310> make<00:03:05.430> it<00:03:05.550> easier<00:03:05.820> for<00:03:06.060> new

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
and which will make it easier for new

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.080 
and which will make it easier for new
