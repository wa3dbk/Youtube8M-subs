00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.820
 defense is the tank in case to 50 as 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:03.140
 tank in games we have a hitler who 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:06.680
 Support tea is we have a measure that is 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.410
 a magical charm in itself has it has a lot 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.500
 many skill that even in great plate the 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.870
 Dad went too fast said chan 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.170

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.520
 murder is visible and such 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.950
 we have a single being that is the south south face that 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.180

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.650
 new character I have not tested yet 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:55.880

 ruby variation we have air that mehdi that 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.760

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:01.310
 I also did not test the medical 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.540
 what a new character 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.940
 these are each each character has 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:12.019
