00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.530
 I have total certainty that here the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.850
 days the physical condition to be wrong 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.710
 it's better 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.770
 then no more about adding so much 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:20.320
 Welsh and that screw is a turner that 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.160
 let's try to decrease it the goals 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:27.010
 suffered and good and doing it the best 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.330
 possible to always be at 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:32.150
 pending of the companions 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.040
 and I do sell what face is acquiring 

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.260
 querétaro with the passage of weeks 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.050
 what is it going to sign this is a 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:43.690
 match 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:47.230
 the truth is interview the team already 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.360
 have a very good point and do it factor 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.520
 d 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.250
 from the group of donors to be practically 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.760
 the same ones of autumn of the past now no 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.310
 has arrived arrived pieces very 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.070
 important 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.410
 then we have as one a 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.470
 chemistry 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.890
 and now with all the preseason that 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.530
 we have done all the time that víctor 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.440
 have to make all the changes that 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.750
 wants tactical part of technical part 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.040
 I think we're going to have a very bad 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.890
 great and we are seeing we are doing 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.990
 a great pre-season and I think for 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.619
 the party that is the most important thing and 25 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.490
 July against quotas we will be very 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.490
 well the person 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:42.950
 if the idea is not like the Argentines 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:47.509
 all the truth we are all in one 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.729
 we are very well tuned we are all 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:53.649
 together to do the best possible and 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.649
 make a great tournament without commissions 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.740
 the truth we have to be 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.619
 well the two because they are two very tournaments 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.410
 important the league that all to the 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.780
 importance and in the 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.209
 concachampios for being a tournament that 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.290
 international for being a screw that 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.900
 plugged 2016 world club gas 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.450
 for players for managers 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.980
 for fiction it is very important 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.989
 dispute an international tournament 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.500
 then we are going to do what 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:36.700
 possible to be well to be 100% in 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.700
 the tournaments as much as 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.520
 that is a decision of víctor 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.140
 and we have to be ready to 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:53.900
 any month as much as league as of 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.730
 coca serfs practically players 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.910
 they want to play the tamer numbers of 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.390
 new possible and with me the same thing happened 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.209
 I seem to be playing is like a 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.240
 play an international tournament that's not 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:11.870
 a dream that I also have and have 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:14.990
 those decisions of Victor air he knows 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:18.790
 handle the reasons very well and see that 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.790
 I have to play each tournament 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.840
 the defense soon by the 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:27.690
 reincorporation of it 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.970
 and also talked about the arrival of a 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:35.879
 central defense this kind of changes 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:39.750
 true these changes are models to 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:41.020
 from the moment a player arrives 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.560
 new 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:47.260
 I think he always comes to play 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:50.470
 comes to add to make the group or 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.720
 stronger team and we are going to 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:54.400
 being open arms to 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.820
 receive that comes to go well and to be 

00:03:54.400 --> 00:04:00.010
 also that is in the selection and I 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:01.620
 I think that whoever plays the team is going to 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.880
 be strong 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:08.780
 as already be like 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.990
 milk and that is right now in the team 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:15.020
 holder who played the last matches 

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:17.080
 against odds badges played against morelia 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.790
 he also played a very important role 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.830
 then all are ready are 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.830
 prepared to do the best 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:38.160
 last week you came to Mexico from 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:41.670
 knowing everything it represents 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.290
 I believe that this second tournament is very 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.750
 important also why they are of 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.050
 to keep a rogue and it was noticed in the 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.069
 past 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:53.199
 keep the good image and for that 

00:04:51.069 --> 00:04:57.069
 I have to do what I wanted tournament 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:05:00.729
 the past 10 of workouts do it 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:05:04.569
 the most other meters I am a player 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:06.400
 that he thought a lot that the game is a 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.580
 consequence of training 

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:11.620
 so if he trains well he spent maximum 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.960
 training and then going to do what 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:16.930
 best of mind then I always go 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:19.270
 will be working like this to the fullest 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.159
 better have the workouts for 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:24.479
 that in games I can have this 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:24.479
 so a goal 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:32.399
 Personally, do it at the 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:35.639
 shortcuts to score my teammates and 

00:05:32.399 --> 00:05:39.330
 logically win a title we study 

00:05:35.639 --> 00:05:44.339
 very close to getting a title within the 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:46.050
 past and I have like I do not have to 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:49.679
 I did not know how to dispose as jeffrey but 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.080
 as it is locked here by which 

00:05:49.679 --> 00:05:54.879
 are of 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:57.830
 of having picado with the runner-up and 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:00.500
 now for this tournament I will do what 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.950
 possible together with my colleagues for 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:05.440
 that we can 

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:09.420
 win a title that is league 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:09.420
 because it stays with spending more
