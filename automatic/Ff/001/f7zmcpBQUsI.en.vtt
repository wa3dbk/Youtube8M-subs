doesn't make it a little difficult I

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.720 
doesn't make it a little difficult I
teach<00:00:09.630> my<00:00:09.900> student<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.559> trick<00:00:10.950> it's<00:00:11.340> called<00:00:11.639> a

google or you can do my search on my
youtube<00:00:21.449> channel<00:00:21.480> anyway<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.590> thing

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
youtube channel anyway the thing

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.849 
youtube channel anyway the thing
revolves<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.869> multiply<00:00:25.410> those<00:00:25.619> two

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
revolves is this you multiply those two

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:27.740 
revolves is this you multiply those two
coefficient<00:00:26.580> in<00:00:26.760> there<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.420> set<00:00:27.720> a

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
coefficient in there and you set a

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.349 
coefficient in there and you set a
factor<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.470> difficult<00:00:29.400> one<00:00:29.640> you're<00:00:30.119> going<00:00:30.269> to

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
factor the difficult one you're going to

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.319 
factor the difficult one you're going to
factor<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.050> easier<00:00:31.679> one<00:00:31.980> so<00:00:32.309> 12<00:00:32.640> times<00:00:32.880> 2<00:00:33.210> is

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
factor a easier one so 12 times 2 is

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.130 
factor a easier one so 12 times 2 is
minus<00:00:33.360> 24<00:00:34.320> this<00:00:34.890> one<00:00:35.160> gets<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.610> be<00:00:35.730> X<00:00:35.969> minus<00:00:36.420> 8<00:00:36.630> X

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
minus 24 this one gets to be X minus 8 X

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.340 
minus 24 this one gets to be X minus 8 X
plus<00:00:37.680> 3<00:00:38.070> that's<00:00:38.700> easy<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.210> factor<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.809> then

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
plus 3 that's easy to factor and then

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.130 
plus 3 that's easy to factor and then
when<00:00:40.530> you<00:00:40.620> do<00:00:40.800> is<00:00:40.920> you<00:00:41.040> come<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.460> this<00:00:41.700> box<00:00:42.140> and

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
when you do is you come out this box and

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.170 
when you do is you come out this box and
you<00:00:43.379> started<00:00:43.739> writing<00:00:43.950> X<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.579> here<00:00:44.640> you're

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
you started writing X in here you're

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.150 
you started writing X in here you're
going<00:00:45.300> to<00:00:45.360> put<00:00:45.600> whatever<00:00:45.840> koi<00:00:46.559> fish<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.070> you

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
going to put whatever koi fish and you

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.770 
going to put whatever koi fish and you
did<00:00:47.370> have<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.480> it's<00:00:48.600> 12<00:00:48.840> X<00:00:49.079> minus<00:00:49.500> 8<00:00:49.710> 12<00:00:50.700> X<00:00:50.969> plus

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
did have so it's 12 X minus 8 12 X plus

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.080 
did have so it's 12 X minus 8 12 X plus
3<00:00:53.420> obviously<00:00:54.420> 12x<00:00:55.140> times<00:00:55.410> 12x<00:00:55.980> no<00:00:56.489> longer<00:00:56.850> give

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
3 obviously 12x times 12x no longer give

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.779 
3 obviously 12x times 12x no longer give
you<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.449> 12x<00:00:57.899> squared<00:00:58.020> so<00:00:58.980> when<00:00:59.219> normalize

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
you the 12x squared so when normalize

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.260 
you the 12x squared so when normalize
this<00:01:00.000> by<00:01:00.059> dividing<00:01:00.870> 12<00:01:01.430> okay<00:01:02.430> now<00:01:02.879> here<00:01:03.149> it

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
this by dividing 12 okay now here it

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.820 
this by dividing 12 okay now here it
gets<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.600> little<00:01:03.690> complicated<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.559> lot<00:01:04.680> of

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
gets a little complicated a lot of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.560 
gets a little complicated a lot of
students<00:01:05.220> say<00:01:05.309> well<00:01:05.339> 12<00:01:05.729> doesn't<00:01:06.180> go<00:01:06.299> into

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
students say well 12 doesn't go into

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.760 
students say well 12 doesn't go into
either<00:01:06.750> one<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.140> them<00:01:07.470> that's<00:01:07.710> true<00:01:08.010> however

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
either one of them that's true however

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.640 
either one of them that's true however
12<00:01:10.770> can<00:01:11.159> be<00:01:11.310> factored<00:01:11.700> into<00:01:11.880> 4<00:01:12.299> times<00:01:12.540> 3<00:01:12.960> this

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
12 can be factored into 4 times 3 this

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.550 
12 can be factored into 4 times 3 this
always<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.549> case<00:01:14.790> as<00:01:15.720> in<00:01:16.049> you<00:01:16.200> can<00:01:16.350> always

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
always is the case as in you can always

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.690 
always is the case as in you can always
simplify<00:01:17.509> one<00:01:18.509> more<00:01:18.689> step<00:01:18.990> X<00:01:19.350> plus<00:01:19.619> 3<00:01:20.070> okay<00:01:20.460> so

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
simplify one more step X plus 3 okay so

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.179 
simplify one more step X plus 3 okay so
I'm<00:01:21.360> going<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.630> divide<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.140> by<00:01:22.259> 4<00:01:22.590> on<00:01:22.920> this

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
I'm going to divide it by 4 on this

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.090 
I'm going to divide it by 4 on this
chunk<00:01:23.720> and<00:01:24.720> I'm<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.020> divide<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.409> by<00:01:25.500> 3<00:01:25.830> on

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
chunk and I'm going to divide it by 3 on

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.789 
chunk and I'm going to divide it by 3 on
this<00:01:26.250> chunk<00:01:26.580> then<00:01:27.030> both<00:01:27.689> of<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.080> factors<00:01:28.530> can

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
this chunk then both of the factors can

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.969 
this chunk then both of the factors can
be<00:01:28.829> simplified<00:01:29.759> for<00:01:30.360> here<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.659> have<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:30.990> 3x<00:01:31.470> minus

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
be simplified for here I have a 3x minus

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.749 
be simplified for here I have a 3x minus
2<00:01:32.250> 4<00:01:33.240> here<00:01:33.479> I<00:01:33.509> have<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> 4x<00:01:34.200> plus<00:01:34.710> 1<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.490> here's

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
2 4 here I have a 4x plus 1 so here's

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.020 
2 4 here I have a 4x plus 1 so here's
the<00:01:36.000> final<00:01:36.210> answer<00:01:36.720> 3x<00:01:37.500> minus<00:01:38.009> 2<00:01:38.220> times<00:01:38.640> 4x

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the final answer 3x minus 2 times 4x

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.870 
the final answer 3x minus 2 times 4x
plus<00:01:39.479> 1<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.259> it's<00:01:40.710> always<00:01:41.009> good<00:01:41.220> idea<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.729> do<00:01:41.850> a

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
plus 1 and it's always good idea to do a

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.469 
plus 1 and it's always good idea to do a
quick<00:01:42.180> check<00:01:42.450> so<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.110> 12x<00:01:43.710> squared<00:01:44.479> plus

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
quick check so here is 12x squared plus

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.929 
quick check so here is 12x squared plus
3x<00:01:45.960> minus<00:01:47.299> 8<00:01:48.299> X<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.960> minus<00:01:49.500> 2<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.250> have<00:01:50.369> back

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
3x minus 8 X and minus 2 so I have back

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.359 
3x minus 8 X and minus 2 so I have back
when<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.720> started<00:01:52.229> with<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.619> was<00:01:52.740> 12x<00:01:53.280> squared

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
when I started with it was 12x squared

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:58.100 
when I started with it was 12x squared
minus<00:01:54.270> 5x<00:01:54.720> minus<00:01:55.020> 2<00:01:55.860> all<00:01:56.490> right<00:01:56.549> hope<00:01:57.450> this<00:01:57.810> has

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
minus 5x minus 2 all right hope this has

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.359
