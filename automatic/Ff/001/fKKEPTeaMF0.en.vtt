00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.710
 I never thought that in life 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.279
 eyebrows would have been an element 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.349
 so important but fortunately in the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.829
 recent years have become a big one 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:35.070
 trend and we are all taking care of it as if 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.930
 they were daughters personally not 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.550
 I never leave home without having well 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.550
 rigged and defined 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.840
 last night I was good because 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.120
 infected eyebrows before 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.649
 go to bed then the blushes that you 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.409
 are created have had time to 

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.360
 calm down but sometimes I forget about 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:58.659
 do it then i do it before 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.250
 put on makeup with consequent concealer 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.350
 hide those eyebrows, etc. 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.690
 there are times when we say there are 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.000
 phases in which the use of powders e 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.560
 then angled brushes now instead 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.430
 i'm finding myself very well with one 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:28.750
 pencil and started doing in the little ones 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:32.409
 traits of the lower part then I take 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.800
 a colored gel and this besides fixing 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:38.770
 it will also give me a little more texture for 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.479
 an effect a little more natural than this 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.479
 the other also the fibers inside 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:52.560
 then to better define especially 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.560
 I mean, I'll take some corrector 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:07.050
 I sculpt practically the drawing and the 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.050
 also the whole arch light 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.050
 eyebrow 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.070
 the difference between before and after is 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.340
 really total I can't get out 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.620
 without making up the eyebrows for that 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.870
 they really give the frame a character 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.870
 the eye perfectly gaze at the face 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.970
 all therefore absolutely the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.810
 eyebrows have to be done 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:36.470
 gel powders anything but you need to 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.470
 them
