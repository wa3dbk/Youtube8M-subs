minimize the application you know I you

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.220 
minimize the application you know I you
know<00:03:13.740> normally<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.580> will<00:03:15.090> stop<00:03:15.450> that's<00:03:16.050> the

way the Apple designed to stop when you

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.240 
way the Apple designed to stop when you
wanna<00:03:18.660> minimize<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:19.230> but<00:03:19.620> with<00:03:19.770> background

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
wanna minimize it but with background

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.250 
wanna minimize it but with background
there<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.550> can<00:03:20.760> do<00:03:20.970> Emily<00:03:21.780> you<00:03:21.930> can<00:03:22.110> minimize

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
there you can do Emily you can minimize

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.740 
there you can do Emily you can minimize
your<00:03:22.590> application<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.340> it's<00:03:23.970> still<00:03:24.600> be

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
your application and it's still be

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.470 
your application and it's still be
running<00:03:24.900> on<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:26.130> ground<00:03:26.400> and<00:03:27.030> in<00:03:27.180> that's<00:03:27.300> the

running on the ground and in that's the

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.270 
running on the ground and in that's the
