connective<00:01:49.350> tissue<00:01:50.030> because<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:51.329> our

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
connective tissue because of this our

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.660 
connective tissue because of this our
joints<00:01:52.409> are<00:01:52.500> not<00:01:52.619> getting<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.009> raw<00:01:53.130> materials

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
joints are not getting the raw materials

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.730 
joints are not getting the raw materials
they<00:01:53.790> need<00:01:53.820> to<00:01:54.119> repair<00:01:54.450> themselves<00:01:54.740> now

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
they need to repair themselves now

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.550 
they need to repair themselves now
scientists<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.700> doctors<00:01:57.530> postulated<00:01:58.530> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
scientists and doctors postulated that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.499 
scientists and doctors postulated that
the<00:01:59.100> reason<00:01:59.430> why<00:01:59.549> our<00:01:59.579> joints<00:02:00.060> don't<00:02:00.149> repair

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the reason why our joints don't repair

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.609 
the reason why our joints don't repair
themselves<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.049> because<00:02:01.140> there's<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.469> very

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
themselves is because there's a very

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.020 
themselves is because there's a very
small<00:02:01.799> blood<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> blood<00:02:02.640> supply<00:02:02.670> is

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
small blood that the blood supply is

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.630 
small blood that the blood supply is
very<00:02:03.299> low<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.570> them<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.049> that<00:02:04.649> everyone

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
very low to them and that everyone

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.160 
very low to them and that everyone
believed<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.240> for<00:02:06.479> a<00:02:06.509> number<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.810> years<00:02:07.049> and

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
believed that for a number of years and

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.359 
believed that for a number of years and
then<00:02:07.259> people<00:02:07.439> started<00:02:07.799> taking<00:02:07.920> glucosamine

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
then people started taking glucosamine

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.589 
then people started taking glucosamine
supplements<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.090> they<00:02:09.149> started<00:02:09.420> realizing

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
supplements and they started realizing

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.260 
supplements and they started realizing
that<00:02:09.899> we<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.679> regrow<00:02:11.069> knee<00:02:11.250> cartilage<00:02:11.459> if<00:02:11.910> we

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
that we can regrow knee cartilage if we

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
that we can regrow knee cartilage if we
give<00:02:12.420> people<00:02:12.569> this<00:02:12.870> stuff

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
give people this stuff

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.350 
give people this stuff
so<00:02:14.040> everyone<00:02:14.580> started<00:02:14.879> using<00:02:15.090> these

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
so everyone started using these

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.750 
so everyone started using these
supplements<00:02:15.810> back<00:02:16.500> in<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.769> 90s<00:02:17.189> and<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.610> you

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
supplements back in the 90s and and you

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.190 
supplements back in the 90s and and you
know<00:02:17.849> what<00:02:18.000> I<00:02:18.030> was<00:02:18.360> one<00:02:18.540> of<00:02:18.569> those<00:02:18.720> people<00:02:18.900> and

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
know what I was one of those people and

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.720 
know what I was one of those people and
I<00:02:19.260> noticed<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.799> I<00:02:19.980> wasn't<00:02:20.310> getting<00:02:20.610> any

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
I noticed that I wasn't getting any

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.179 
I noticed that I wasn't getting any
relief<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.299> most<00:02:21.959> people<00:02:22.290> how<00:02:22.769> many<00:02:22.950> people

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189

relief and most people how many people
here<00:02:23.310> bought<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.670> glucosamine<00:02:24.299> supplement<00:02:24.720> and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
here bought a glucosamine supplement and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.740 
here bought a glucosamine supplement and
had<00:02:25.590> never<00:02:25.769> finished<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.189> bottle<00:02:26.750> yeah

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
had never finished the bottle yeah

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.600 
had never finished the bottle yeah
that's<00:02:27.930> all<00:02:28.019> yeah<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.290> lot<00:02:28.530> of<00:02:28.620> you<00:02:28.739> I<00:02:28.920> was<00:02:29.459> one

of those people too and then I realized
they<00:02:31.980> did<00:02:32.099> a<00:02:32.129> little<00:02:32.340> research<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.760> realized

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
they did a little research I realized

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.089 
they did a little research I realized
that<00:02:33.239> the<00:02:33.810> dosages<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.620> they're<00:02:34.769> telling

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
that the dosages that they're telling

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:37.940 
that the dosages that they're telling
you<00:02:35.190> to<00:02:35.280> take<00:02:35.519> on<00:02:35.819> the<00:02:36.239> bottle<00:02:36.860> anywhere<00:02:37.860> from

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
you to take on the bottle anywhere from

1,500 to 2,000 milligrams a day and

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.559 
1,500 to 2,000 milligrams a day and
that's<00:02:40.530> high<00:02:40.709> if<00:02:41.069> they<00:02:41.250> recommend<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.760> won't

hips so I bought on these glucosamine

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.629 
hips so I bought on these glucosamine
tablets<00:03:19.349> and<00:03:19.470> they<00:03:19.980> wouldn't<00:03:20.190> eat<00:03:20.280> them<00:03:20.400> and

come running they looked at me like I
was<00:03:25.739> crazy<00:03:26.040> so<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.370> picked<00:03:26.669> it<00:03:26.760> up<00:03:26.879> and<00:03:27.030> I<00:03:27.090> tasted

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
was crazy so I picked it up and I tasted

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:28.819 
was crazy so I picked it up and I tasted
it<00:03:27.629> and<00:03:27.840> I<00:03:27.900> realized<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.379> this<00:03:28.530> tastes<00:03:28.769> like

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
it and I realized that this tastes like

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.470 
it and I realized that this tastes like
this<00:03:29.250> tastes<00:03:29.519> like<00:03:29.609> ass<00:03:29.790> you<00:03:30.060> know<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.329> is

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
this tastes like ass you know this is

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.530 
this tastes like ass you know this is
horrendous<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:32.280> I<00:03:32.579> wound<00:03:33.060> up<00:03:33.180> having<00:03:33.329> to

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:33.540 
horrendous and so I wound up having to

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.119 
horrendous and so I wound up having to
get<00:03:33.660> them<00:03:33.840> chicken<00:03:34.530> strips<00:03:34.859> that<00:03:35.010> were

00:03:35.119 --> 00:03:35.129 
get them chicken strips that were

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:37.039 
get them chicken strips that were
embedded<00:03:35.549> with<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.699> glucosamine<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.540> now

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
embedded with the glucosamine and now

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.809 
embedded with the glucosamine and now
they<00:03:37.199> eat<00:03:37.349> them<00:03:37.560> so<00:03:37.949> I<00:03:37.980> realized<00:03:38.579> that<00:03:38.699> the

00:03:38.809 --> 00:03:38.819 
they eat them so I realized that the

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:40.520 
they eat them so I realized that the
reason<00:03:39.120> why<00:03:39.209> we<00:03:39.359> take<00:03:39.510> glucosamine<00:03:39.900> pills<00:03:40.379> is

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
reason why we take glucosamine pills is

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.319 
reason why we take glucosamine pills is
because<00:03:40.739> they<00:03:40.829> taste<00:03:41.069> terrible<00:03:41.220> but<00:03:42.180> that

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
because they taste terrible but that

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.720 
because they taste terrible but that
doesn't<00:03:42.629> mean<00:03:42.750> that<00:03:43.190> you<00:03:44.190> know<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.639> you

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
doesn't mean that you know that you

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.789 
doesn't mean that you know that you
should<00:03:44.879> take<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.090> small<00:03:45.419> amount<00:03:45.799> through

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
should take a small amount through

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.500 
should take a small amount through
experimentation<00:03:47.699> and<00:03:47.790> some<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.239> reading

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
experimentation and some of the reading

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:49.670 
experimentation and some of the reading
I<00:03:48.569> did<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.780> found<00:03:48.989> that<00:03:49.109> you<00:03:49.230> need<00:03:49.379> to<00:03:49.500> take

I did I found that you need to take

I did I found that you need to take
about<00:03:49.829> a<00:03:49.949> minimum<00:03:50.400> of<00:03:50.579> four<00:03:50.849> thousand

least a thousand chondroitin today and

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.259 
least a thousand chondroitin today and
you<00:03:58.889> should<00:03:59.069> add<00:03:59.220> some<00:03:59.250> boron<00:03:59.819> in<00:03:59.970> there<00:04:00.090> for

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
you should add some boron in there for

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.569 
you should add some boron in there for
good<00:04:00.299> measure<00:04:00.739> when<00:04:01.739> I<00:04:01.769> started<00:04:02.220> doing<00:04:02.489> this

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
good measure when I started doing this

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.220 
good measure when I started doing this
on<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.790> regular<00:04:02.849> basis<00:04:03.569> within<00:04:03.900> two<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.109> three
