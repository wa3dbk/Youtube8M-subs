doesn't<00:01:34.799> have<00:01:35.130> to<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.640> exact<00:01:36.180> same

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
doesn't have to have the exact same

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.990 
doesn't have to have the exact same
weapon<00:01:37.200> so<00:01:37.530> if<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.860> are<00:01:38.040> using<00:01:38.340> let's<00:01:38.729> say<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
weapon so if you are using let's say the

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.530 
weapon so if you are using let's say the
suppressor<00:01:39.600> on<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.259> PDW<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.220> he's<00:01:41.909> using

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
suppressor on the PDW and he's using

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.270 
suppressor on the PDW and he's using
like<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> fast<00:01:43.320> max<00:01:43.649> and<00:01:43.890> stuff<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.220> that

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
like the fast max and stuff like that

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.600 
like the fast max and stuff like that
you<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.360> also<00:01:45.710> pick<00:01:46.710> up<00:01:46.920> the<00:01:47.130> weapon<00:01:47.460> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
you can also pick up the weapon and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.850 
you can also pick up the weapon and
refill<00:01:48.180> your<00:01:48.329> mo<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.930> doesn't<00:01:49.350> matter<00:01:49.560> what

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
refill your mo it doesn't matter what

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.980 
refill your mo it doesn't matter what
attachment<00:01:50.520> yes<00:01:50.729> it<00:01:50.939> only<00:01:51.180> has<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.450> be<00:01:51.780> the

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
attachment yes it only has to be the

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.710 
attachment yes it only has to be the
exact<00:01:52.439> same<00:01:52.829> weapon<00:01:53.399> so<00:01:54.030> that's<00:01:54.299> why<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> asked

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
exact same weapon so that's why I asked

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.020 
exact same weapon so that's why I asked
the<00:01:54.930> question<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.470> scavenger<00:01:56.009> pointless<00:01:56.579> if

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
the question is scavenger pointless if

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.580 
the question is scavenger pointless if
you<00:01:57.149> can<00:01:57.299> run<00:01:57.479> around<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.899> refill<00:01:58.259> your<00:01:58.409> mo

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
you can run around and refill your mo

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.649 
you can run around and refill your mo
all<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.070> time<00:01:59.369> because<00:01:59.909> you're<00:02:00.329> using<00:02:00.479> a

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
all the time because you're using a

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.660 
all the time because you're using a
weapon<00:02:00.840> everyone<00:02:01.259> else<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.740> using<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.250> right

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
weapon everyone else is using and right

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.120 
weapon everyone else is using and right
at<00:02:02.850> the<00:02:03.000> moment<00:02:03.119> everyone<00:02:04.020> is<00:02:04.140> using<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.560> PDW

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
at the moment everyone is using the PDW

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.700 
at the moment everyone is using the PDW
because<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.759> first<00:02:05.790> SMG<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.750> unlock<00:02:07.200> so

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
because it's the first SMG you unlock so

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.369 
because it's the first SMG you unlock so
if<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.039> use<00:02:08.220> the<00:02:08.250> PDW<00:02:09.060> you<00:02:09.569> will<00:02:09.750> always<00:02:10.349> have

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
if you use the PDW you will always have

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.770 
if you use the PDW you will always have
ammunition<00:02:10.950> there's<00:02:11.520> no<00:02:12.239> question<00:02:12.720> about

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
ammunition there's no question about

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.700 
ammunition there's no question about
that<00:02:12.959> so

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
that so

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.980 
that so
scavenger<00:02:14.430> would<00:02:14.580> be<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> total<00:02:15.510> waste<00:02:15.690> of<00:02:15.870> a

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
scavenger would be a total waste of a

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.530 
scavenger would be a total waste of a
perk<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.560> there<00:02:17.520> are<00:02:17.640> not<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.060> many<00:02:18.120> weapons

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 
perk and there are not so many weapons

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.380 
perk and there are not so many weapons
in<00:02:18.840> that<00:02:18.990> game<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.620> there<00:02:20.550> is<00:02:20.700> always<00:02:21.150> someone

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
in that game and there is always someone

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.520 
in that game and there is always someone
on<00:02:21.540> the<00:02:21.660> other<00:02:21.690> team<00:02:21.840> that's<00:02:22.230> using<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
on the other team that's using the

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.230 
on the other team that's using the
weapon<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.040> are<00:02:23.190> using<00:02:23.370> if<00:02:23.670> you<00:02:23.910> are<00:02:24.090> not

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
weapon you are using if you are not

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.990 
weapon you are using if you are not
using<00:02:24.450> some<00:02:24.720> kind<00:02:24.780> of<00:02:25.200> weird<00:02:25.620> weapon<00:02:26.310> or<00:02:26.760> maybe

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
using some kind of weird weapon or maybe

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.790 
using some kind of weird weapon or maybe
a<00:02:27.120> weapon<00:02:27.420> that<00:02:27.450> will<00:02:27.690> be<00:02:27.870> unlocked<00:02:28.170> very<00:02:28.500> late

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
a weapon that will be unlocked very late

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.580 
a weapon that will be unlocked very late
so<00:02:29.400> scavenge<00:02:29.970> would<00:02:30.120> be<00:02:30.300> a<00:02:30.330> total<00:02:30.900> waste<00:02:30.930> and

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
so scavenge would be a total waste and

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:34.070 
so scavenge would be a total waste and
you<00:02:32.460> know<00:02:32.610> just<00:02:33.060> for<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.300> grenades<00:02:33.660> I<00:02:33.840> don't

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
you know just for the grenades I don't

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.170 
you know just for the grenades I don't
think<00:02:34.260> it's<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:34.800> important<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.640> always<00:02:35.820> have

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
think it's that important to always have

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.510 
think it's that important to always have
grenades<00:02:36.630> because<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.560> gun<00:02:37.800> skill<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.310> much

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
grenades because a gun skill is much

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.060 
grenades because a gun skill is much
more<00:02:38.760> important<00:02:39.360> and<00:02:39.540> yeah<00:02:40.410> as<00:02:40.620> I<00:02:40.680> said<00:02:40.830> you

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.070 
more important and yeah as I said you

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.190 
more important and yeah as I said you
don't<00:02:41.280> need<00:02:41.520> scavenger<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.510> refill<00:02:42.900> your<00:02:42.930> mo

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
don't need scavenger to refill your mo

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.890 
don't need scavenger to refill your mo
on<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:43.560> gun<00:02:44.180> so<00:02:45.180> what<00:02:45.360> do<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:45.600> think<00:02:45.840> about

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
on the gun so what do you think about

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.840 
on the gun so what do you think about
scavenger<00:02:46.560> do<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.770> really<00:02:47.010> think<00:02:47.250> it's<00:02:47.460> that

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
scavenger do you really think it's that

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.780 
scavenger do you really think it's that
good<00:02:48.570> of<00:02:48.630> a<00:02:48.870> perk<00:02:49.200> anymore<00:02:49.680> if<00:02:50.070> that's<00:02:50.400> changed

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
good of a perk anymore if that's changed

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.730 
good of a perk anymore if that's changed
like<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.270> and<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.600> think<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:51.960> a<00:02:52.080> great<00:02:52.110> thing

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
like that and I think it's a great thing

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.290 
like that and I think it's a great thing
that<00:02:52.920> they<00:02:53.040> change<00:02:53.310> that<00:02:53.520> because<00:02:53.700> I<00:02:53.940> never

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
that they change that because I never

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.740 
that they change that because I never
understood<00:02:54.830> why<00:02:55.830> if<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.460> have<00:02:56.790> an<00:02:56.910> MP<00:02:57.240> 7<00:02:57.600> and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
understood why if I have an MP 7 and

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.050 
understood why if I have an MP 7 and
there's<00:02:57.870> an<00:02:58.020> MP<00:02:58.260> 7<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.710> ground<00:02:59.040> even<00:02:59.790> if<00:02:59.910> it

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
there's an MP 7 on the ground even if it

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.330 
there's an MP 7 on the ground even if it
has<00:03:00.240> different<00:03:00.540> attachments<00:03:01.380> why<00:03:01.830> I<00:03:01.860> wasn't

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
has different attachments why I wasn't

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.940 
has different attachments why I wasn't
unable<00:03:02.820> to<00:03:03.090> pick<00:03:03.300> up<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.660> ammunition<00:03:04.200> because

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
unable to pick up the ammunition because

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.040 
unable to pick up the ammunition because
it's<00:03:05.280> not<00:03:05.520> like<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:06.300> know<00:03:06.390> just<00:03:06.600> because<00:03:06.660> an

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
it's not like you know just because an

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.040 
it's not like you know just because an
MP<00:03:07.320> 7<00:03:07.620> had<00:03:07.740> read<00:03:07.950> outside<00:03:08.370> on<00:03:08.700> it<00:03:09.060> it<00:03:09.300> would

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
MP 7 had read outside on it it would

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.020 
MP 7 had read outside on it it would
have<00:03:10.320> I<00:03:10.680> don't<00:03:10.920> know<00:03:11.360> maybe<00:03:12.360> two<00:03:12.900> times<00:03:13.200> bigger

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
have I don't know maybe two times bigger

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.280 
have I don't know maybe two times bigger
bullets<00:03:15.030> or<00:03:15.150> something<00:03:15.450> like<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:16.260> know

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
bullets or something like that you know

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.990 
bullets or something like that you know
the<00:03:16.710> ammunition<00:03:16.920> doesn't<00:03:17.520> change<00:03:17.700> dust

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
the ammunition doesn't change dust

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.570
