out and this one's credit to teals one

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.539 
out and this one's credit to teals one
because<00:01:48.960> it<00:01:49.409> looks<00:01:49.590> like<00:01:49.799> she<00:01:50.070> got<00:01:50.220> the

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
because it looks like she got the

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.819 
so that looks like what the law notes
are<00:01:56.310> going<00:01:56.430> to<00:01:56.549> look<00:01:56.640> like<00:01:56.700> um<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.659> know<00:01:57.829> my
