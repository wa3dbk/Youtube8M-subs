it's the first time we've been brave

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.190 
it's the first time we've been brave
enough<00:00:48.740> to<00:00:49.010> try<00:00:49.340> out<00:00:49.520> a<00:00:49.880> three<00:00:50.390> mil<00:00:50.630> three

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:51.200 
enough to try out a three mil three

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.950 
enough to try out a three mil three
point<00:00:51.440> five<00:00:51.620> million<00:00:52.390> basically<00:00:53.390> in<00:00:53.630> this<00:00:53.780> war

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
point five million basically in this war

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:03.700 
point five million basically in this war
at<00:00:54.079> water<00:00:54.260> temperature<00:01:01.750> on<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.200> sense<00:01:03.649> that

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
at water temperature on the sense that

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.490 
at water temperature on the sense that
with<00:01:03.950> a<00:01:04.040> Korres<00:01:04.280> body<00:01:04.610> and<00:01:05.299> then<00:01:05.509> on<00:01:05.689> the<00:01:05.780> arms

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
with a Korres body and then on the arms

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.110 
with a Korres body and then on the arms
of<00:01:06.620> the<00:01:06.710> suit<00:01:06.920> you've<00:01:07.130> got<00:01:07.340> the<00:01:07.490> free<00:01:07.909> meal

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
of the suit you've got the free meal

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.940 
of the suit you've got the free meal
neoprene<00:01:08.680> okay

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
neoprene okay

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.980 
neoprene okay
basically<00:01:10.790> the<00:01:11.120> key<00:01:11.300> thing<00:01:11.540> about<00:01:11.600> this<00:01:11.870> you

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:11.990 
basically the key thing about this you

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.350 
basically the key thing about this you
should<00:01:12.170> know<00:01:12.260> about<00:01:12.380> this<00:01:12.650> neoprene<00:01:12.920> is<00:01:13.360> the

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
should know about this neoprene is the

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.450 
should know about this neoprene is the
increased<00:01:14.720> amount<00:01:14.930> of<00:01:15.050> air<00:01:15.290> inside<00:01:15.890> which

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
increased amount of air inside which

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:22.080 
increased amount of air inside which
gives<00:01:16.700> more<00:01:16.909> flexibility<00:01:17.810> and<00:01:18.020> more<00:01:18.170> stretch

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:45.390 

wearing<00:01:23.090> a<00:01:23.150> 3.5<00:01:43.869> check<00:01:44.869> it<00:01:45.049> out

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
wearing a 3.5 check it out

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.560 
wearing a 3.5 check it out
basically<00:01:46.400> there's<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:46.880> much<00:01:47.000> air<00:01:47.270> in<00:01:47.479> the

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
basically there's so much air in the

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.260 
basically there's so much air in the
normal<00:01:47.900> neoprene<00:01:48.520> it<00:01:49.520> makes<00:01:49.760> it<00:01:49.909> much<00:01:50.060> more

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
normal neoprene it makes it much more

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.420 
normal neoprene it makes it much more
light<00:01:50.540> actually<00:01:51.110> I<00:01:51.320> was<00:01:51.470> telling<00:01:51.950> lies<00:01:52.100> before

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
light actually I was telling lies before

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.609 
light actually I was telling lies before
it's<00:01:52.549> 30ml<00:01:53.060> 30%<00:01:53.780> lighter<00:01:53.990> than<00:01:54.320> a<00:01:54.380> normal

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
it's 30ml 30% lighter than a normal

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.190 
it's 30ml 30% lighter than a normal
wetsuit<00:01:54.950> and<00:01:55.010> 17%<00:01:55.549> water<00:01:55.880> warmer<00:01:56.450> the<00:01:56.900> reason

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
wetsuit and 17% water warmer the reason

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.780 
wetsuit and 17% water warmer the reason
is<00:01:57.320> it<00:01:57.439> holds<00:01:57.770> all<00:01:57.860> the<00:01:57.950> hot<00:01:58.100> air<00:01:58.310> inside<00:01:58.460> the

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
is it holds all the hot air inside the

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:00.280 
is it holds all the hot air inside the
suit<00:01:59.030> much<00:01:59.270> better<00:01:59.509> than<00:01:59.689> normal<00:01:59.810> neoprene

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
suit much better than normal neoprene

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.390 
suit much better than normal neoprene
because<00:02:00.470> there's<00:02:00.590> loads<00:02:00.740> more<00:02:00.830> air<00:02:01.070> bubbles

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:01.400 
because there's loads more air bubbles

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.340 
because there's loads more air bubbles
inside<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.880> rubber<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.330> basically<00:02:03.110> that

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
inside the rubber and basically that

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.170 
inside the rubber and basically that
means<00:02:03.530> it<00:02:03.619> keeps<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:03.979> super<00:02:04.700> warm<00:02:05.030> because

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180 
means it keeps you super warm because

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.100 
means it keeps you super warm because
all<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.450> heat<00:02:05.600> that<00:02:05.630> leaves<00:02:05.930> your<00:02:06.049> body

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
all the heat that leaves your body

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.539 
all the heat that leaves your body
instead<00:02:06.560> of<00:02:06.619> being<00:02:06.860> lost<00:02:07.070> through<00:02:07.520> the

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
instead of being lost through the

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.369 
instead of being lost through the
neoprene<00:02:08.000> it's<00:02:08.420> basically<00:02:08.720> stored<00:02:09.080> inside

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:09.379 
neoprene it's basically stored inside

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.709 
neoprene it's basically stored inside
keeping<00:02:09.769> your<00:02:09.920> loads<00:02:10.069> warmer<00:02:10.459> that<00:02:11.060> combined

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:11.719 
keeping your loads warmer that combined

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:14.110 
keeping your loads warmer that combined
with<00:02:12.019> this<00:02:12.829> will<00:02:13.069> honeycomb<00:02:13.549> effect<00:02:13.879> which<00:02:14.090> is

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
with this will honeycomb effect which is

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.940 
with this will honeycomb effect which is
potholes<00:02:14.689> inside<00:02:15.049> the<00:02:15.169> suit<00:02:15.379> thank<00:02:15.769> you

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
potholes inside the suit thank you

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.650 
potholes inside the suit thank you
even<00:02:16.250> more<00:02:16.430> area<00:02:16.760> inside<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.030> suit<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.480> keeps

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
even more area inside the suit and keeps

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.030 
even more area inside the suit and keeps
you<00:02:17.720> even<00:02:17.930> warmer<00:02:18.200> you've<00:02:18.680> then<00:02:18.800> got<00:02:18.980> the

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
you even warmer you've then got the

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:20.890 
you even warmer you've then got the
super-stretch<00:02:19.640> kind<00:02:19.910> of<00:02:19.970> weird<00:02:20.180> jersey<00:02:20.690> over

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
super-stretch kind of weird jersey over

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.420 
super-stretch kind of weird jersey over
the<00:02:20.989> top<00:02:21.200> inside<00:02:21.650> and<00:02:21.860> outside<00:02:21.950> the<00:02:22.129> suit

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
the top inside and outside the suit

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.979 
the top inside and outside the suit
which<00:02:22.879> basically<00:02:23.180> adds<00:02:23.480> even<00:02:23.690> more

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
which basically adds even more

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.110 
which basically adds even more
flexibility<00:02:24.560> so<00:02:25.129> essentially<00:02:25.519> it's<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.670> 3.5

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 
flexibility so essentially it's a 3.5

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.589 
flexibility so essentially it's a 3.5
milky<00:02:27.080> pew<00:02:27.319> which<00:02:27.890> feels<00:02:28.160> like<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.459> summer<00:02:29.390> suit

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
milky pew which feels like a summer suit

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.630 
milky pew which feels like a summer suit
