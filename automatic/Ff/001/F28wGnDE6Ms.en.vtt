00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
Chinese it says lithium-ion here and I'm

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:51.930 
Chinese it says lithium-ion here and I'm
pretty<00:00:48.909> sure<00:00:48.970> it's<00:00:49.390> not<00:00:49.949> gonna<00:00:50.949> be<00:00:51.220> that<00:00:51.460> great

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
pretty sure it's not gonna be that great

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.810 
pretty sure it's not gonna be that great
when<00:00:52.089> I<00:00:52.180> take<00:00:52.390> it<00:00:52.479> apart<00:00:53.430> I'll<00:00:54.430> show<00:00:54.610> you<00:00:54.699> what

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
when I take it apart I'll show you what

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.399 
when I take it apart I'll show you what
I<00:00:54.850> have<00:00:56.610> this<00:00:57.610> is<00:00:57.670> it<00:00:57.940> here<00:00:58.239> and<00:00:58.420> as<00:00:59.140> you<00:00:59.290> can

00:00:59.399 --> 00:00:59.409 
I have this is it here and as you can

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:03.119 
I have this is it here and as you can
see<00:00:59.470> I've<00:00:59.799> already<00:00:59.890> peeled<00:01:00.339> the<00:01:00.580> outer<00:01:02.129> jacket

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
see I've already peeled the outer jacket

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.899 
see I've already peeled the outer jacket
off<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:05.130> just<00:01:06.130> so<00:01:06.250> you<00:01:06.340> know<00:01:06.400> I've<00:01:06.640> over

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
off and just so you know I've over

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:08.580 
off and just so you know I've over
charged<00:01:07.240> this<00:01:07.360> battery<00:01:07.420> using<00:01:08.080> a<00:01:08.140> lipo

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
charged this battery using a lipo

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.000 
charged this battery using a lipo
charger<00:01:08.619> and<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.900> know<00:01:11.020> basically<00:01:11.710> it<00:01:11.830> now

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
charger and you know basically it now

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.990 
charger and you know basically it now
does<00:01:12.310> not<00:01:12.490> take<00:01:12.729> a<00:01:12.760> charge<00:01:13.060> so<00:01:13.869> there's<00:01:15.000> the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
does not take a charge so there's the

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.530 
does not take a charge so there's the
top<00:01:16.240> end<00:01:17.070> there's<00:01:18.070> a<00:01:18.189> bottom<00:01:18.670> end<00:01:18.880> and<00:01:19.090> the

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
top end there's a bottom end and the

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.600 
top end there's a bottom end and the
outside<00:01:19.990> shielding<00:01:20.710> and<00:01:20.860> I<00:01:20.950> take<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.250> dremel

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
outside shielding and I take the dremel

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:24.240 
outside shielding and I take the dremel
and<00:01:21.790> cut<00:01:22.570> it<00:01:22.690> open<00:01:22.890> let's<00:01:23.890> see<00:01:24.010> if<00:01:24.100> there<00:01:24.220> is

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.250 
and cut it open let's see if there is

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:26.070 
and cut it open let's see if there is
any<00:01:24.520> circuitry<00:01:25.000> at<00:01:25.090> all<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.450> what<00:01:25.540> exactly<00:01:25.870> is

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
any circuitry at all and what exactly is

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.929 
any circuitry at all and what exactly is
inside

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.749 

okay<00:01:35.679> here<00:01:36.679> we<00:01:36.710> are<00:01:36.829> all<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.429> way<00:01:37.549> around<00:01:37.909> and

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
okay here we are all the way around and

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:47.080 
okay here we are all the way around and
I'm<00:01:40.759> gonna<00:01:41.030> pull<00:01:41.359> out<00:01:44.710> what's<00:01:45.710> in<00:01:46.039> there<00:01:46.369> and

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
I'm gonna pull out what's in there and

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.819 
I'm gonna pull out what's in there and
right<00:01:47.450> off<00:01:47.600> the<00:01:47.630> bat<00:01:47.929> you<00:01:48.170> see<00:01:48.200> that's<00:01:48.590> there's

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
right off the bat you see that's there's

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.639 
right off the bat you see that's there's
just<00:01:49.100> a<00:01:49.159> little<00:01:49.840> metal<00:01:50.840> tab<00:01:50.869> going<00:01:51.500> through

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
just a little metal tab going through

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:54.429 
just a little metal tab going through
the<00:01:51.740> front<00:01:52.039> I<00:01:52.959> don't<00:01:53.959> actually<00:01:54.140> see<00:01:54.319> any

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
the front I don't actually see any

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:55.270 
the front I don't actually see any
circuitry

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
circuitry

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.429 
circuitry
I<00:01:55.310> will<00:01:56.000> take<00:01:56.209> this<00:01:56.359> apart<00:01:56.719> as<00:01:56.899> well<00:01:57.079> to<00:01:57.289> make

00:01:57.429 --> 00:01:57.439 
I will take this apart as well to make

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.599 
I will take this apart as well to make
sure<00:01:57.469> that<00:01:57.799> there's<00:01:58.009> something<00:01:58.340> in<00:01:58.459> there

00:01:58.599 --> 00:01:58.609 
sure that there's something in there

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:59.859 
sure that there's something in there
whether<00:01:59.060> there's<00:01:59.299> something<00:01:59.479> in<00:01:59.689> there<00:01:59.810> or

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
whether there's something in there or

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.480 
whether there's something in there or
not<00:01:59.990> and<00:02:00.920> what<00:02:01.189> we<00:02:01.310> see<00:02:01.490> inside<00:02:01.849> is<00:02:03.340> looks<00:02:04.340> like

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
not and what we see inside is looks like

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.119 
not and what we see inside is looks like
wrap<00:02:04.729> that<00:02:04.969> battery<00:02:05.420> so<00:02:06.380> let's<00:02:06.590> pull<00:02:06.770> that<00:02:06.920> out

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
wrap that battery so let's pull that out

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:20.890 
wrap that battery so let's pull that out
again<00:02:10.870> and<00:02:13.989> the<00:02:14.989> cap<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.730> as<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:20.569> can<00:02:20.720> see

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
again and the cap so as you can see

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.199 
again and the cap so as you can see
there's<00:02:21.170> what's<00:02:21.440> in<00:02:21.739> it

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
there's what's in it

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.470 
there's what's in it
so<00:02:23.660> next<00:02:23.870> I'm<00:02:24.019> gonna<00:02:24.140> cut<00:02:24.379> it<00:02:24.500> with<00:02:25.480> lengthwise

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
so next I'm gonna cut it with lengthwise

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.680 
so next I'm gonna cut it with lengthwise
there<00:02:26.780> and<00:02:27.879> see<00:02:28.879> what's<00:02:29.030> inside<00:02:29.180> all<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.599> way

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
there and see what's inside all the way

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.300 
there and see what's inside all the way
through<00:02:29.959> and<00:02:30.709> see<00:02:30.920> if<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.069> can<00:02:31.220> unwrap<00:02:31.549> this<00:02:31.730> up

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
through and see if I can unwrap this up

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.390 
through and see if I can unwrap this up
okay<00:02:34.310> there's<00:02:34.549> the<00:02:34.730> end<00:02:34.910> cap<00:02:35.560> taken<00:02:36.560> off<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:37.099> I

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
okay there's the end cap taken off and I

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.150 
okay there's the end cap taken off and I
actually<00:02:37.519> cut<00:02:37.910> half<00:02:38.180> of<00:02:38.480> cut<00:02:39.440> it<00:02:39.530> in<00:02:39.620> half<00:02:39.829> or

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
actually cut half of cut it in half or

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.680 
actually cut half of cut it in half or
more<00:02:40.459> let's<00:02:40.700> cut<00:02:40.880> through<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.239> to<00:02:41.420> see<00:02:41.599> if

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
more let's cut through it to see if

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.339 
more let's cut through it to see if
there's<00:02:41.810> any<00:02:41.959> circuitry<00:02:42.530> in<00:02:42.620> it<00:02:42.769> and<00:02:44.139> choke<00:02:45.139> it

00:02:45.339 --> 00:02:45.349 
there's any circuitry in it and choke it

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.490 
there's any circuitry in it and choke it
here<00:02:45.620> I<00:02:46.090> can<00:02:47.090> safely<00:02:47.569> say<00:02:47.810> there's<00:02:48.260> no

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
here I can safely say there's no

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.089 
here I can safely say there's no
circuitry<00:02:49.130> in<00:02:49.370> the<00:02:49.670> positive<00:02:50.150> end<00:02:50.810> cap<00:02:51.109> okay

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
circuitry in the positive end cap okay

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.000 
circuitry in the positive end cap okay
it's<00:02:52.280> just<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.760> cap<00:02:53.209> that's<00:02:53.660> all<00:02:53.840> it<00:02:53.989> is<00:02:54.139> okay<00:02:54.950> so

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
it's just a cap that's all it is okay so

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.849 
it's just a cap that's all it is okay so
we'll<00:02:55.760> move<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.150> to<00:02:56.349> what's<00:02:57.349> left<00:02:57.440> of<00:02:57.739> the

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
we'll move on to what's left of the

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.909 
we'll move on to what's left of the
battery<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:59.150> I'm<00:02:59.810> gonna<00:02:59.959> cut<00:03:00.200> that<00:03:00.440> open<00:03:00.500> to

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
battery and I'm gonna cut that open to

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.289 
battery and I'm gonna cut that open to
see<00:03:01.130> what<00:03:01.280> that<00:03:01.430> battery<00:03:01.819> looks<00:03:01.940> like<00:03:02.150> I'm

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
see what that battery looks like I'm

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.309 
see what that battery looks like I'm
gonna<00:03:02.389> see<00:03:02.540> if<00:03:02.599> there's<00:03:02.750> any<00:03:02.870> protection

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:03.319 
gonna see if there's any protection

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:04.870 
gonna see if there's any protection
circuitry<00:03:03.769> in<00:03:03.950> there<00:03:04.160> and<00:03:04.280> what<00:03:04.400> it<00:03:04.519> actually

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
circuitry in there and what it actually

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.690 
circuitry in there and what it actually
the<00:03:05.000> guts<00:03:05.209> look<00:03:05.450> like<00:03:06.459> okay<00:03:07.459> I've<00:03:07.549> been

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
the guts look like okay I've been

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.080 
the guts look like okay I've been
cutting<00:03:07.910> through<00:03:08.209> it<00:03:08.269> and<00:03:08.599> I'd<00:03:09.230> say<00:03:09.530> the

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
cutting through it and I'd say the

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.670 
cutting through it and I'd say the
majority<00:03:11.090> of<00:03:11.540> the<00:03:11.690> weight<00:03:11.840> on<00:03:12.019> this<00:03:12.139> batteries

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
majority of the weight on this batteries

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.860 
majority of the weight on this batteries
probably<00:03:13.069> they<00:03:13.160> were<00:03:13.220> a<00:03:13.310> robust<00:03:13.870> metal

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
probably they were a robust metal

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.470 
probably they were a robust metal
housing<00:03:16.780> pulling<00:03:17.780> it<00:03:17.870> open<00:03:18.230> now<00:03:18.410> so<00:03:19.150> you<00:03:20.150> still

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
housing pulling it open now so you still

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.509 
housing pulling it open now so you still
be<00:03:20.599> a<00:03:20.630> problem<00:03:20.900> because<00:03:21.169> they<00:03:22.099> use<00:03:22.310> such<00:03:22.489> a

00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
be a problem because they use such a

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.390 
be a problem because they use such a
tough<00:03:22.900> outside<00:03:23.900> casing<00:03:24.169> which<00:03:24.739> is<00:03:24.889> good<00:03:25.099> but

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
tough outside casing which is good but

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.339 
tough outside casing which is good but
let's<00:03:26.359> say<00:03:26.569> the<00:03:26.690> majority<00:03:26.930> of<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:27.200> weight

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:27.349 
let's say the majority of the weight

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:32.830 
let's say the majority of the weight
again<00:03:28.190> is<00:03:28.760> the<00:03:28.910> outside<00:03:29.239> housing<00:03:31.660> I'm<00:03:32.660> gonna

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
again is the outside housing I'm gonna

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.089 
again is the outside housing I'm gonna
rip<00:03:32.989> that<00:03:33.139> open<00:03:33.169> and<00:03:33.590> I'll<00:03:33.709> show<00:03:33.859> it<00:03:33.950> to<00:03:33.980> you

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
rip that open and I'll show it to you

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:35.790 
rip that open and I'll show it to you
open<00:03:34.250> up

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 
open up

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.770 
open up
okay<00:03:36.340> here's<00:03:36.580> the<00:03:36.700> housing<00:03:37.090> ripped<00:03:37.300> open<00:03:37.480> and

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
okay here's the housing ripped open and

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:39.120 
okay here's the housing ripped open and
this<00:03:37.870> is<00:03:38.020> what<00:03:38.170> came<00:03:38.380> out<00:03:38.500> of<00:03:38.560> it<00:03:38.710> this<00:03:38.950> little

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
this is what came out of it this little

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.850 
this is what came out of it this little
piece<00:03:39.430> of<00:03:39.610> copper<00:03:40.090> and<00:03:40.420> this<00:03:40.630> tab<00:03:41.320> here<00:03:41.710> which

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
piece of copper and this tab here which

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.140 
piece of copper and this tab here which
I'm<00:03:42.010> sure<00:03:42.220> it<00:03:42.310> connects<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.790> negative

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 
I'm sure it connects the negative

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.930 
I'm sure it connects the negative
portion<00:03:43.360> of<00:03:43.660> this<00:03:43.780> battery<00:03:44.580> what's<00:03:45.580> left<00:03:45.850> of

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
portion of this battery what's left of

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.840 
portion of this battery what's left of
this<00:03:46.030> battery<00:03:46.390> anyways<00:03:46.750> what's<00:03:46.930> in<00:03:47.080> here

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
this battery anyways what's in here

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.780 
this battery anyways what's in here
still<00:03:48.850> don't<00:03:49.150> see<00:03:49.300> any<00:03:49.480> circuitry<00:03:50.020> in<00:03:50.140> it<00:03:50.790> let

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
still don't see any circuitry in it let

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.060 
still don't see any circuitry in it let
me<00:03:51.850> wait<00:03:52.030> the<00:03:52.180> outside<00:03:53.140> casing<00:03:53.380> on<00:03:53.710> the<00:03:53.890> whole

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
me wait the outside casing on the whole

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.910 
me wait the outside casing on the whole
battery's<00:03:54.430> weight<00:03:54.610> was<00:03:54.760> 37<00:03:55.300> grams<00:03:58.800> just<00:03:59.800> the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
battery's weight was 37 grams just the

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.270 
battery's weight was 37 grams just the
outside<00:04:00.220> casing<00:04:00.460> is<00:04:00.730> 12<00:04:01.090> grams<00:04:01.660> so<00:04:02.200> let's<00:04:03.100> put

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
outside casing is 12 grams so let's put

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.950 
outside casing is 12 grams so let's put
the<00:04:03.430> cap<00:04:04.270> and<00:04:04.540> stuff<00:04:04.840> on<00:04:05.020> it<00:04:05.200> to<00:04:06.450> 15<00:04:07.450> grams<00:04:07.690> of

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
the cap and stuff on it to 15 grams of

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.290 
the cap and stuff on it to 15 grams of
the<00:04:08.020> batteries<00:04:08.410> just<00:04:08.440> casing<00:04:09.190> material<00:04:12.300> let's

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300 
the batteries just casing material let's

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.280 
the batteries just casing material let's
see<00:04:13.420> the<00:04:13.510> inside<00:04:13.810> guts<00:04:14.080> what<00:04:14.290> they<00:04:14.440> weigh<00:04:14.790> 21

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
see the inside guts what they weigh 21

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.020 
see the inside guts what they weigh 21
okay<00:04:17.290> so<00:04:17.830> I<00:04:17.860> lost<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.250> little<00:04:18.340> bit<00:04:18.549> on<00:04:18.670> the<00:04:18.760> metal

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
okay so I lost a little bit on the metal

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:23.850 
okay so I lost a little bit on the metal
there<00:04:19.980> the<00:04:20.980> metal<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.310> cut<00:04:21.520> off<00:04:21.670> of<00:04:21.850> it<00:04:22.000> so<00:04:22.860> total

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
there the metal I cut off of it so total

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.760 
there the metal I cut off of it so total
weight<00:04:23.980> of<00:04:24.070> this<00:04:24.160> bag<00:04:24.340> 21<00:04:24.790> grams<00:04:25.740> amber

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
weight of this bag 21 grams amber

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.440 
weight of this bag 21 grams amber
unravel<00:04:27.340> this<00:04:27.460> carefully<00:04:28.030> and<00:04:28.180> see<00:04:28.300> what<00:04:28.420> I

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
unravel this carefully and see what I

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.640 
unravel this carefully and see what I
got<00:04:30.150> okay<00:04:31.150> so<00:04:31.420> I'm<00:04:31.690> just<00:04:31.810> gonna<00:04:31.960> peel<00:04:32.200> a<00:04:32.230> little

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
got okay so I'm just gonna peel a little

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.320 
got okay so I'm just gonna peel a little
bit<00:04:33.090> layers<00:04:34.090> off<00:04:34.390> of<00:04:34.570> it<00:04:35.610> again<00:04:36.610> it's<00:04:36.790> yet<00:04:37.180> to

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
bit layers off of it again it's yet to

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:53.090 
bit layers off of it again it's yet to
see<00:04:37.510> any<00:04:37.630> circuitry<00:04:38.230> on<00:04:38.350> this

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:56.810 

so<00:04:54.100> it's<00:04:54.220> just<00:04:54.310> a<00:04:54.460> great<00:04:54.640> big<00:04:54.790> long<00:04:55.000> band

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
so it's just a great big long band

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.950 
so it's just a great big long band
materials<00:04:57.820> which<00:04:57.970> what<00:04:58.150> you<00:04:58.180> expect<00:04:58.840> to<00:04:58.870> find

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
materials which what you expect to find

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.480 
materials which what you expect to find
on<00:04:59.350> us<00:04:59.470> I<00:04:59.680> don't<00:04:59.920> know<00:05:00.010> if<00:05:00.100> it's<00:05:00.280> what<00:05:00.460> you

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
on us I don't know if it's what you

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:05.490 
on us I don't know if it's what you
expect<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:00.910> find<00:05:01.000> on<00:05:01.330> the<00:05:01.420> battery<00:05:01.780> but<00:05:04.500> all

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
expect to find on the battery but all

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:06.770 
expect to find on the battery but all
the<00:05:05.620> way<00:05:05.740> to<00:05:05.800> the<00:05:05.950> end

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
the way to the end

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:13.310 
the way to the end
I'm<00:05:07.780> gonna<00:05:07.990> pull<00:05:08.470> each<00:05:08.620> layer<00:05:08.890> off<00:05:11.400> one<00:05:12.400> there

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:13.320 
I'm gonna pull each layer off one there

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:22.560 
I'm gonna pull each layer off one there
man<00:05:14.350> smells<00:05:19.650> use<00:05:20.650> the<00:05:20.830> other<00:05:20.950> there's<00:05:21.570> just

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570 
man smells use the other there's just

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:30.709 
man smells use the other there's just
more<00:05:22.750> of<00:05:22.810> the<00:05:22.960> same

00:05:30.709 --> 00:05:30.719 

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:34.459 

so<00:05:31.879> my<00:05:32.879> basic<00:05:33.119> conclusion<00:05:33.809> here<00:05:33.989> is<00:05:34.019> that<00:05:34.289> this

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
so my basic conclusion here is that this

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.459 
so my basic conclusion here is that this
battery<00:05:35.339> has<00:05:35.909> no<00:05:36.299> circuit<00:05:36.719> protection<00:05:37.049> at<00:05:37.319> all

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
battery has no circuit protection at all

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:41.299 
battery has no circuit protection at all
but<00:05:38.459> I<00:05:38.489> can<00:05:38.729> see<00:05:39.469> there's<00:05:40.469> no<00:05:40.589> electronics<00:05:41.189> in

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:41.309 
but I can see there's no electronics in

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.929 
but I can see there's no electronics in
it<00:05:41.429> anyway

00:05:41.929 --> 00:05:41.939 
it anyway

00:05:41.939 --> 00:05:44.709 
it anyway
maybe<00:05:42.569> there's<00:05:42.779> a<00:05:42.869> cheap<00:05:43.739> fuse<00:05:44.099> or<00:05:44.399> something

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:44.719 
maybe there's a cheap fuse or something

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:52.100 
maybe there's a cheap fuse or something
but<00:05:45.719> definitely<00:05:48.529> nothing<00:05:49.529> I<00:05:49.769> could<00:05:49.919> see<00:05:51.110> as

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110 
but definitely nothing I could see as

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:53.959 
but definitely nothing I could see as
far<00:05:52.259> as<00:05:52.409> electronics<00:05:52.949> go<00:05:53.129> so<00:05:53.610> there's<00:05:53.819> no

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:53.969 
far as electronics go so there's no

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:56.449 
far as electronics go so there's no
temperature<00:05:54.979> sensor<00:05:55.979> or<00:05:56.099> anything<00:05:56.279> like<00:05:56.399> that

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:56.459 
temperature sensor or anything like that

00:05:56.459 --> 00:06:00.669 
temperature sensor or anything like that
in<00:05:56.819> it<00:05:57.979> yeah<00:05:58.979> and<00:05:59.459> that's<00:06:00.059> it

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:00.679 
in it yeah and that's it

00:06:00.679 --> 00:06:04.159 
in it yeah and that's it
that's<00:06:01.679> the<00:06:01.799> battery<00:06:02.009> pulled<00:06:02.579> apart<00:06:02.989> all<00:06:03.989> the

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:04.169 
that's the battery pulled apart all the

00:06:04.169 --> 00:06:08.229 
that's the battery pulled apart all the
guts<00:06:04.379> man<00:06:04.949> I<00:06:04.979> gotta<00:06:05.369> tell<00:06:05.399> you<00:06:05.639> it<00:06:05.729> smells<00:06:05.969> bad

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:08.239 
guts man I gotta tell you it smells bad

00:06:08.239 --> 00:06:12.589 
guts man I gotta tell you it smells bad
most<00:06:09.239> circuitry<00:06:09.689> in<00:06:09.809> that<00:06:09.989> at<00:06:10.079> all<00:06:10.369> so<00:06:11.599> you

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:12.599 
most circuitry in that at all so you

00:06:12.599 --> 00:06:14.089 
most circuitry in that at all so you
know<00:06:12.719> they<00:06:13.079> say<00:06:13.289> it<00:06:13.409> has<00:06:13.529> a<00:06:13.559> protection

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:14.099 
know they say it has a protection

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:17.839 
know they say it has a protection
circuit<00:06:14.429> in<00:06:14.550> it<00:06:15.139> short<00:06:16.139> of<00:06:16.289> a<00:06:16.409> sort<00:06:16.889> of<00:06:17.039> fuse<00:06:17.550> or

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:17.849 
circuit in it short of a sort of fuse or

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:19.579 
circuit in it short of a sort of fuse or
something<00:06:18.269> that<00:06:18.479> might<00:06:18.749> melt<00:06:19.050> when<00:06:19.319> it<00:06:19.409> gets

00:06:19.579 --> 00:06:19.589 
something that might melt when it gets

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:21.309 
something that might melt when it gets
too<00:06:19.739> hot<00:06:19.979> or<00:06:20.129> something<00:06:20.279> I<00:06:20.699> don't<00:06:20.909> see<00:06:20.969> it

00:06:21.309 --> 00:06:21.319 
too hot or something I don't see it

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:23.749 
too hot or something I don't see it
there's<00:06:22.319> all<00:06:22.499> the<00:06:22.589> components<00:06:23.129> and<00:06:23.610> I<00:06:23.699> don't

00:06:23.749 --> 00:06:23.759 
there's all the components and I don't

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:27.679 
there's all the components and I don't
see<00:06:24.029> a<00:06:24.059> single<00:06:24.589> piece<00:06:25.589> of<00:06:25.619> electronic<00:06:26.689> circuit

see a single piece of electronic circuit

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:30.469 
see a single piece of electronic circuit
protection<00:06:28.199> in<00:06:28.529> it<00:06:28.739> now<00:06:29.269> that's<00:06:30.269> at

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
protection in it now that's at

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:32.509 
protection in it now that's at
Electronic<00:06:31.110> there<00:06:31.319> might<00:06:31.499> be<00:06:31.529> some<00:06:32.219> sort<00:06:32.459> of

00:06:32.509 --> 00:06:32.519 
Electronic there might be some sort of

00:06:32.519 --> 00:06:35.239 
Electronic there might be some sort of
thermal<00:06:32.729> fuse<00:06:33.149> in<00:06:33.360> it<00:06:33.479> but<00:06:33.689> I<00:06:33.929> don't<00:06:34.860> see<00:06:35.129> it

00:06:35.239 --> 00:06:35.249 
thermal fuse in it but I don't see it

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:37.699 
thermal fuse in it but I don't see it
and<00:06:35.610> you<00:06:36.539> know<00:06:36.659> when<00:06:36.809> I<00:06:36.839> charged<00:06:37.559> it

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:37.709 
and you know when I charged it

00:06:37.709 --> 00:06:39.729 
and you know when I charged it
overcharged<00:06:38.249> that<00:06:38.489> it<00:06:38.729> obviously<00:06:38.849> did<00:06:39.360> not

00:06:39.729 --> 00:06:39.739 
overcharged that it obviously did not

00:06:39.739 --> 00:06:42.559 
overcharged that it obviously did not
stop<00:06:40.739> it<00:06:40.919> from<00:06:41.159> getting<00:06:41.669> really<00:06:41.969> hot<00:06:42.269> because

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:42.569 
stop it from getting really hot because

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:44.499 
stop it from getting really hot because
it<00:06:42.839> really<00:06:43.019> got<00:06:43.169> really<00:06:43.409> hot<00:06:43.589> and<00:06:43.619> it

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:44.509 
it really got really hot and it

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:46.999 
it really got really hot and it
overcharged<00:06:45.509> and<00:06:45.719> now<00:06:46.529> it<00:06:46.589> does<00:06:46.800> take<00:06:46.829> a

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:47.009 
overcharged and now it does take a

00:06:47.009 --> 00:06:48.439 
overcharged and now it does take a
charge<00:06:47.219> at<00:06:47.369> all<00:06:47.489> well<00:06:47.909> of<00:06:47.939> course<00:06:47.999> now<00:06:48.300> it

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:48.449 
charge at all well of course now it

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:49.819 
charge at all well of course now it
doesn't<00:06:48.689> take<00:06:48.779> a<00:06:48.809> charge<00:06:48.989> also<00:06:49.229> before<00:06:49.589> I<00:06:49.649> took

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:49.829 
doesn't take a charge also before I took

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:51.109 
doesn't take a charge also before I took
it<00:06:49.919> apart<00:06:50.099> did<00:06:50.339> you<00:06:50.399> take<00:06:50.519> it<00:06:50.610> a<00:06:50.669> charge<00:06:50.909> at<00:06:51.029> all

00:06:51.109 --> 00:06:51.119 
it apart did you take it a charge at all

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:55.519 
it apart did you take it a charge at all
either<00:06:51.529> so<00:06:52.610> there's<00:06:53.610> no<00:06:53.819> circuitry<00:06:54.389> there<00:06:54.569> -

00:06:55.519 --> 00:06:55.529 
either so there's no circuitry there -

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:58.549 
either so there's no circuitry there -
no<00:06:56.369> electronic<00:06:57.059> circuitry<00:06:57.509> there<00:06:57.749> to<00:06:58.229> protect

00:06:58.549 --> 00:06:58.559 
no electronic circuitry there to protect

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:00.889 
no electronic circuitry there to protect
that<00:06:58.679> battery<00:06:59.129> and<00:06:59.339> that's<00:07:00.209> the<00:07:00.419> guts<00:07:00.599> of<00:07:00.809> it

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:00.899 
that battery and that's the guts of it

00:07:00.899 --> 00:07:03.169 
that battery and that's the guts of it
so<00:07:01.679> you<00:07:02.369> know<00:07:02.459> that's<00:07:02.610> what<00:07:02.819> you're<00:07:02.939> getting

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:03.179 
so you know that's what you're getting

00:07:03.179 --> 00:07:06.249 
so you know that's what you're getting
when<00:07:03.269> you<00:07:03.300> get<00:07:03.509> one<00:07:03.629> of<00:07:03.659> these<00:07:03.749> ultrafire<00:07:05.149> TRS

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:06.259 
when you get one of these ultrafire TRS

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:11.179 
when you get one of these ultrafire TRS
1860's<00:07:07.259> bring<00:07:08.039> it<00:07:08.129> up<00:07:08.249> closer<00:07:08.459> there<00:07:09.289> but<00:07:10.289> you

00:07:11.179 --> 00:07:11.189 
1860's bring it up closer there but you

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:13.399 
1860's bring it up closer there but you
know<00:07:11.309> again<00:07:11.999> I<00:07:12.269> don't<00:07:12.509> know<00:07:12.749> it's<00:07:12.959> just<00:07:13.110> a<00:07:13.229> real

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:13.409 
know again I don't know it's just a real

00:07:13.409 --> 00:07:17.239 
know again I don't know it's just a real
one<00:07:13.649> is<00:07:13.860> this<00:07:13.979> a<00:07:14.039> fake<00:07:14.369> one<00:07:14.779> no<00:07:15.779> idea<00:07:16.139> right<00:07:16.739> you

00:07:17.239 --> 00:07:17.249 
one is this a fake one no idea right you

00:07:17.249 --> 00:07:20.749 
one is this a fake one no idea right you
can<00:07:17.399> never<00:07:17.579> tell<00:07:17.819> but<00:07:18.649> again<00:07:19.649> they<00:07:20.309> seem<00:07:20.579> to

00:07:20.749 --> 00:07:20.759 
can never tell but again they seem to

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:23.479 
can never tell but again they seem to
work<00:07:20.879> okay<00:07:21.689> in<00:07:22.349> the<00:07:22.979> battery<00:07:23.309> in<00:07:23.459> the

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:23.489 
work okay in the battery in the

00:07:23.489 --> 00:07:25.850 
work okay in the battery in the
flashlights<00:07:24.059> I've<00:07:24.239> put<00:07:24.599> them<00:07:24.749> in<00:07:24.869> too<00:07:25.050> but

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:25.860 
flashlights I've put them in too but

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.959 
flashlights I've put them in too but
again<00:07:26.129> I<00:07:26.579> don't<00:07:26.879> see<00:07:27.209> any<00:07:27.419> protection<00:07:27.929> in<00:07:28.050> them

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:28.969 
again I don't see any protection in them

00:07:28.969 --> 00:07:35.119 
again I don't see any protection in them
so<00:07:29.989> that's<00:07:30.989> my<00:07:31.369> ultra<00:07:32.369> fire<00:07:32.579> ATR<00:07:33.449> 1860<00:07:34.259> 4500

00:07:35.119 --> 00:07:35.129 
so that's my ultra fire ATR 1860 4500

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:37.389 
so that's my ultra fire ATR 1860 4500
milliamp<00:07:35.550> hour<00:07:35.849> three<00:07:36.809> point<00:07:37.019> seven<00:07:37.169> volt

00:07:37.389 --> 00:07:37.399 
milliamp hour three point seven volt
