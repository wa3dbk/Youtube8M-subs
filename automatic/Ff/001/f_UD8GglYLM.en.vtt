the computers but the parts of it good I
only<00:00:28.320> have<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:28.890> problem<00:00:29.279> was<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.670> side<00:00:30.029> wall

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
only have one problem was a side wall

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.009 
only have one problem was a side wall
right<00:00:30.510> here

it<00:00:31.980> didn't<00:00:32.250> want<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.460> fit<00:00:32.640> flush<00:00:32.969> I<00:00:34.790> recommend

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
it didn't want to fit flush I recommend

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.889 
it didn't want to fit flush I recommend
if<00:00:35.880> you<00:00:36.000> put<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:37.790> back<00:00:38.790> wall<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.600> side

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
if you put the back wall and the side

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.990 
if you put the back wall and the side
walls<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.440> first<00:00:40.860> instead<00:00:41.520> of<00:00:41.579> sub-assembly

walls in first instead of sub-assembly
them<00:00:44.329> and<00:00:45.329> you'll<00:00:45.780> get<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:45.989> tighter<00:00:46.559> fit<00:00:46.860> but

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
them and you'll get a tighter fit but

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.639 
them and you'll get a tighter fit but
it's<00:00:49.590> in<00:00:49.890> it's<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.640> matters<00:00:51.350> the<00:00:52.350> front

it's in it's all it matters the front
cockpit<00:00:52.940> it's<00:00:53.940> real<00:00:54.210> well<00:00:54.390> with<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.050> added

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410

if you want to light it you'll need to

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.940 
if you want to light it you'll need to
really<00:01:05.750> plant<00:01:06.110> it<00:01:06.260> because<00:01:06.440> there<00:01:06.590> is<00:01:06.710> not

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
really plant it because there is not

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.820 
really plant it because there is not
much<00:01:07.250> space<00:01:08.200> in<00:01:09.200> between<00:01:09.350> here<00:01:09.560> or<00:01:10.370> the<00:01:10.550> -<00:01:11.830> to

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
space in between but you can write and

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.810 
space in between but you can write and
fiber-optic<00:01:35.960> cables<00:01:36.260> which<00:01:36.470> I<00:01:36.830> test<00:01:37.490> fitted

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
fiber-optic cables which I test fitted

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.570 
fiber-optic cables which I test fitted
and<00:01:37.910> they<00:01:38.000> do<00:01:38.060> work

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
and they do work

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.070

here

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.370 
here
I<00:02:17.340> recommend<00:02:18.340> gluing<00:02:18.700> them<00:02:19.000> on<00:02:19.239> to<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:19.840> first

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
I recommend gluing them on to this first

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.680 
I recommend gluing them on to this first
and<00:02:20.739> then<00:02:20.920> put<00:02:21.819> this<00:02:22.209> on<00:02:22.270> the<00:02:23.170> housing<00:02:24.510> as<00:02:25.510> it

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
and then put this on the housing as it

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.870 
and then put this on the housing as it
is<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:26.519> little<00:02:27.519> of<00:02:27.730> a<00:02:27.819> fit<00:02:29.430> but<00:02:30.430> it<00:02:30.519> goes<00:02:30.670> to<00:02:30.760> get

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
is a little of a fit but it goes to get

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.839 
is a little of a fit but it goes to get
it<00:02:31.000> pretty<00:02:31.300> good<00:02:31.360> you<00:02:31.630> got<00:02:31.780> a<00:02:31.810> little<00:02:32.019> seam

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
it pretty good you got a little seam

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.380 
it pretty good you got a little seam
right<00:02:33.849> here<00:02:34.200> no<00:02:35.200> big<00:02:35.380> deal<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.970> little<00:02:36.970> sanding

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
right here no big deal a little sanding

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.090 
right here no big deal a little sanding
stick<00:02:37.660> get<00:02:38.349> that<00:02:38.530> comp<00:02:38.920> taken<00:02:39.910> care<00:02:40.090> of<00:02:41.069> now<00:02:42.069> I

stick get that comp taken care of now I

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.050 
stick get that comp taken care of now I
probably<00:02:42.400> ain't<00:02:42.640> gonna<00:02:42.700> light<00:02:43.000> the<00:02:43.239> interior

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
probably ain't gonna light the interior

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.330 
probably ain't gonna light the interior
because<00:02:46.060> technically<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.890> only<00:02:47.980> got<00:02:48.250> to<00:02:48.310> see

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
because technically you only got to see

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.729 
because technically you only got to see
about<00:02:48.640> that<00:02:48.940> much<00:02:50.160> on<00:02:51.160> the<00:02:51.250> inside<00:02:51.549> unless<00:02:52.360> you

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
about that much on the inside unless you

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.550 
about that much on the inside unless you
got<00:02:53.739> the<00:02:53.890> hatch<00:02:54.099> open<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.870> I'm<00:02:55.989> gonna<00:02:56.140> smoke

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
got the hatch open and I'm gonna smoke

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.600 
got the hatch open and I'm gonna smoke
the<00:02:57.720> clear<00:02:58.720> part<00:02:58.989> so<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.620> really<00:03:00.099> can't<00:03:00.340> see

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
the clear part so you really can't see

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.839 
the clear part so you really can't see
it<00:03:00.640> but<00:03:01.510> I<00:03:01.599> will<00:03:01.780> light<00:03:01.989> the<00:03:02.140> headlights<00:03:02.849> like

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
it but I will light the headlights like

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:16.009 
it but I will light the headlights like
I<00:03:04.000> did<00:03:04.180> here<00:03:11.459> and<00:03:12.459> one<00:03:12.670> thing<00:03:13.170> on<00:03:14.170> the<00:03:14.290> rear

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
I did here and one thing on the rear

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.930 
I did here and one thing on the rear
this<00:03:17.019> is<00:03:17.170> a<00:03:17.200> vent<00:03:17.560> and<00:03:18.040> you<00:03:18.100> can<00:03:18.430> actually<00:03:18.579> like

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
this is a vent and you can actually like
