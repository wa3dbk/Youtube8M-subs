00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
one I had actually asked you about for

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.890 
one I had actually asked you about for
women<00:00:25.890> as<00:00:26.160> well<00:00:26.189> tell<00:00:26.970> us<00:00:27.000> what<00:00:27.330> some<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
women as well tell us what some of the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.380 
women as well tell us what some of the
major<00:00:28.140> types<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:29.099> hair<00:00:29.340> loss<00:00:29.550> are<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.179> maybe

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
major types of hair loss are and maybe

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.659 
major types of hair loss are and maybe
what<00:00:30.689> causes<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.529> well<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.920> most<00:00:32.099> common<00:00:32.219> one

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
what causes it well the most common one

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.830 
what causes it well the most common one
is<00:00:32.910> what<00:00:33.329> we<00:00:33.480> call<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.719> male<00:00:34.140> pattern<00:00:34.800> baldness

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
is what we call a male pattern baldness

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.280 
is what we call a male pattern baldness
or<00:00:36.840> androgenic<00:00:37.500> alopecia<00:00:38.120> that's<00:00:39.120> 95%<00:00:39.809> of<00:00:40.200> the

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
or androgenic alopecia that's 95% of the

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.139 
or androgenic alopecia that's 95% of the
hair<00:00:40.469> loss<00:00:40.680> and<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.160> cause<00:00:41.370> of<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.760> mostly

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
hair loss and the cause of it is mostly

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.540 
hair loss and the cause of it is mostly
genetics<00:00:42.719> now<00:00:43.230> similar<00:00:43.860> thing<00:00:44.070> happens<00:00:44.399> also

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
genetics now similar thing happens also

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.700 
genetics now similar thing happens also
in<00:00:44.760> women<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.300> genetics<00:00:45.780> plays<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> big<00:00:46.260> role

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
in women and genetics plays a big role

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.500 
in women and genetics plays a big role
so<00:00:47.160> that's<00:00:47.340> majority<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.000> them<00:00:48.210> but<00:00:48.390> then

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
so that's majority of them but then

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.450 
so that's majority of them but then
there<00:00:48.690> are<00:00:48.750> also<00:00:48.840> 5%<00:00:49.710> of<00:00:49.800> them<00:00:49.950> that's<00:00:50.100> caused

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
there are also 5% of them that's caused

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.600 
there are also 5% of them that's caused
the<00:00:50.879> areata<00:00:51.510> alopecia<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:53.039> has<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.399> do<00:00:53.579> a

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
the areata alopecia and that has to do a

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.110 
the areata alopecia and that has to do a
lot<00:00:53.940> with<00:00:53.969> stress<00:00:54.809> illness<00:00:55.610> medical<00:00:56.610> diseases

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
lot with stress illness medical diseases

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.360 
lot with stress illness medical diseases
and<00:00:57.420> chemotherapy<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.350> etc<00:00:58.620> but<00:00:58.949> genetics

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
and chemotherapy and etc but genetics

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.090 
and chemotherapy and etc but genetics
plays<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.670> huge<00:00:59.910> role<00:01:00.239> in<00:01:00.270> this<00:01:01.100> father's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
plays a huge role in this father's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.750 
plays a huge role in this father's
mother<00:01:02.760> mother's<00:01:03.690> father<00:01:04.339> you<00:01:05.339> never<00:01:05.549> know

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
mother mother's father you never know

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.340 
mother mother's father you never know
where<00:01:06.030> it<00:01:06.119> comes<00:01:06.330> from<00:01:06.390> good<00:01:06.689> point<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.110> always

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
where it comes from good point we always

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.109 
where it comes from good point we always
thought<00:01:07.560> it<00:01:07.710> was<00:01:07.830> from<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.040> mother<00:01:08.310> side<00:01:08.610> now

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
thought it was from the mother side now

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.210 
thought it was from the mother side now
a<00:01:09.150> new<00:01:09.479> study<00:01:09.540> shows<00:01:10.049> that<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:10.380> polygenic<00:01:11.040> is

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
a new study shows that it's polygenic is

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.340 
a new study shows that it's polygenic is
from<00:01:11.460> both<00:01:11.640> parents<00:01:11.909> so<00:01:12.689> if<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.049> have<00:01:13.200> the

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
from both parents so if you have the

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.370 
from both parents so if you have the
gene<00:01:13.380> in<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.890> family<00:01:14.340> now<00:01:14.790> you<00:01:15.450> most<00:01:15.869> likely

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
gene in the family now you most likely

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.590 
gene in the family now you most likely
will<00:01:16.710> be<00:01:16.740> affected<00:01:17.460> it<00:01:17.880> can<00:01:18.119> skip<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
will be affected it can skip a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.679 
will be affected it can skip a
generation<00:01:18.630> but<00:01:19.560> that's<00:01:19.830> going<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.100> be<00:01:20.280> their

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:20.689 
generation but that's going to be their

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:23.890 
generation but that's going to be their
sides<00:01:21.689> absolutely<00:01:22.530> what's<00:01:23.070> interesting<00:01:23.340> is

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
sides absolutely what's interesting is

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.810 
sides absolutely what's interesting is
30%<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:24.990> men<00:01:25.170> by<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.439> age<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.770> 30<00:01:26.100> can<00:01:26.369> actually

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
30% of men by the age of 30 can actually

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.300 
30% of men by the age of 30 can actually
have<00:01:27.060> hair<00:01:27.330> loss<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.840> by<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.080> age<00:01:28.259> of<00:01:28.380> 50<00:01:28.829> it

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
have hair loss and by the age of 50 it

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.760 
have hair loss and by the age of 50 it
could<00:01:29.460> be<00:01:29.579> about<00:01:29.729> 50%<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.810> it<00:01:31.380> affects<00:01:31.680> both

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
could be about 50% so it affects both

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.530 
could be about 50% so it affects both
men<00:01:32.220> and<00:01:32.369> women<00:01:32.700> but<00:01:32.909> we're<00:01:33.270> going<00:01:33.390> to<00:01:33.450> be

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
men and women but we're going to be

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.719 
men and women but we're going to be
talking<00:01:33.840> about<00:01:33.900> mostly<00:01:34.200> men<00:01:34.650> here<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.310> their

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
talking about mostly men here and their

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.280 
talking about mostly men here and their
hormonal<00:01:36.150> ease<00:01:36.390> let's<00:01:36.600> talk<00:01:36.810> about<00:01:36.930> some<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
hormonal ease let's talk about some of

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.899 
hormonal ease let's talk about some of
the<00:01:37.380> types<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.799> hair<00:01:37.979> loss<00:01:38.220> in<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.549> symptoms

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
the types of hair loss in the symptoms

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.569 
the types of hair loss in the symptoms
okay<00:01:39.780> so<00:01:40.020> when<00:01:40.560> we<00:01:40.680> talk<00:01:40.829> about<00:01:40.860> androgenic

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
okay so when we talk about androgenic

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.940 
okay so when we talk about androgenic
ones<00:01:41.970> or<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.450> male<00:01:42.960> pattern<00:01:43.229> baldness

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
ones or the male pattern baldness

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.590 
ones or the male pattern baldness
it<00:01:44.100> really<00:01:44.430> starts<00:01:44.939> from<00:01:45.000> receding<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
it really starts from receding the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.450 
it really starts from receding the
hairline<00:01:46.049> it's<00:01:46.560> us<00:01:46.829> going<00:01:47.070> toward<00:01:47.340> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
hairline it's us going toward the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.990 
hairline it's us going toward the
temples<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.210> the<00:01:48.960> most<00:01:49.439> severe<00:01:50.369> case<00:01:50.610> is<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
temples and the most severe case is the

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.910 
temples and the most severe case is the

absolutely<00:02:45.420> you<00:02:46.170> know<00:02:46.260> one<00:02:46.440> of<00:02:46.530> the<00:02:46.620> main

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
absolutely you know one of the main

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.009 
absolutely you know one of the main
causes<00:02:47.160> of<00:02:47.489> this<00:02:47.670> is<00:02:47.940> the<00:02:48.150> male<00:02:48.390> hormone

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
causes of this is the male hormone

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.250 
causes of this is the male hormone
testosterone<00:02:49.489> the<00:02:50.489> scalp<00:02:50.880> you<00:02:51.239> know<00:02:51.959> makes

testosterone the scalp you know makes

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.289 
testosterone the scalp you know makes
this<00:02:52.470> 5-alpha<00:02:53.069> reductase<00:02:53.250> it's<00:02:54.030> an<00:02:54.120> enzyme

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
this 5-alpha reductase it's an enzyme

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:56.300 
this 5-alpha reductase it's an enzyme
that<00:02:54.480> converts<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:55.200> testosterone<00:02:55.890> to

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
that converts the testosterone to

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.550 
that converts the testosterone to
dihydrotestosterone<00:02:56.750> if<00:02:57.750> you<00:02:58.170> look<00:02:58.349> at<00:02:58.470> the

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
dihydrotestosterone if you look at the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.500 
dihydrotestosterone if you look at the
animation<00:02:58.890> you<00:02:59.190> can<00:02:59.340> see<00:02:59.519> the<00:02:59.670> hydro

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
animation you can see the hydro

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.960 
animation you can see the hydro
testosterone<00:03:01.170> or<00:03:01.530> the<00:03:01.799> active<00:03:02.340> form<00:03:02.700> of

follicles and over time it can actually

follicles and over time it can actually
shrink<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.810> base<00:03:10.019> of<00:03:10.260> this<00:03:10.410> hair<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:11.450> you

the active form of testosterone is a

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.729 
the active form of testosterone is a
main<00:03:17.910> reason<00:03:18.150> why<00:03:18.510> men<00:03:18.780> actually<00:03:19.049> lose<00:03:19.500> their

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.039 
has propecia in it as a urologist I use
a<00:03:26.190> lot<00:03:26.549> of<00:03:26.579> proscar<00:03:27.120> because<00:03:27.450> what<00:03:27.630> it<00:03:27.720> does<00:03:27.870> it

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
a lot of proscar because what it does it

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.410 
a lot of proscar because what it does it
prevents<00:03:28.590> that<00:03:28.739> enzyme<00:03:29.310> so<00:03:29.579> it<00:03:29.730> prevents<00:03:30.299> the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
prevents that enzyme so it prevents the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.300 
prevents that enzyme so it prevents the
