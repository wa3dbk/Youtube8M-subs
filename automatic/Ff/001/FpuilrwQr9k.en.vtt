00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.840 
surprised how much those can go for
especially<00:02:00.109> because<00:02:00.590> on<00:02:00.859> a<00:02:01.100> classic<00:02:01.670> like

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
especially because on a classic like

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.120 
especially because on a classic like
this<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:03.350> can't<00:02:03.590> buy<00:02:03.770> them<00:02:03.890> at<00:02:04.039> the

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
dealership anymore and even if you can

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.060 
dealership anymore and even if you can
find<00:02:06.049> them<00:02:06.170> -<00:02:06.259> pretty<00:02:06.469> much<00:02:06.619> going<00:02:06.799> to<00:02:06.890> cost

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
find them - pretty much going to cost
