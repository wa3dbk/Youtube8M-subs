a<00:01:51.360> mount<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.810> very<00:01:52.020> basic<00:01:52.259> mouth<00:01:52.799> but<00:01:53.520> something

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
a mount a very basic mouth but something

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.690 
a mount a very basic mouth but something
that<00:01:54.119> is<00:01:54.299> a<00:01:54.540> lot<00:01:55.020> nicer<00:01:55.079> than<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.799> universal

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
that is a lot nicer than a universal

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.639 
that is a lot nicer than a universal
that's<00:01:57.390> what<00:01:57.630> you're<00:01:57.750> going<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:57.930> get<00:01:58.079> here<00:01:58.409> so

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
that's what you're going to get here so

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.670 
that's what you're going to get here so
some<00:01:58.979> instructions<00:01:59.700> a<00:02:00.509> little<00:02:00.990> diagram<00:02:01.229> at

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
some instructions a little diagram at

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.190 
some instructions a little diagram at
least<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:02.009> how<00:02:02.360> you<00:02:03.360> know<00:02:03.479> they<00:02:03.659> expected<00:02:04.079> you

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
least of how you know they expected you

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.859 
least of how you know they expected you
to<00:02:04.590> put<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.369> infuse<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.210> here<00:02:06.420> but<00:02:06.659> we'll<00:02:06.780> be

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
to put the infuse in here but we'll be

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.969 
to put the infuse in here but we'll be
doing<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.229> with<00:02:07.350> the<00:02:07.439> galaxy<00:02:07.860> in<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:08.039> moment

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
doing that with the galaxy in a moment

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.309 
doing that with the galaxy in a moment
and<00:02:09.099> then<00:02:09.670> of<00:02:09.970> course<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.659> actual<00:02:11.019> mount

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
and then of course the actual mount

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:13.110 
and then of course the actual mount
itself<00:02:11.500> for<00:02:12.129> your<00:02:12.340> dash<00:02:12.580> or<00:02:12.849> windshield

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
itself for your dash or windshield

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.059 
itself for your dash or windshield
really<00:02:13.750> like<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.049> Samsung<00:02:14.440> design<00:02:14.739> on<00:02:14.920> these

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
really like the Samsung design on these

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.880 
really like the Samsung design on these
liked<00:02:15.400> it<00:02:15.549> since<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:15.879> got<00:02:16.060> the<00:02:16.239> one<00:02:16.680> for<00:02:17.680> my

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
liked it since I got the one for my

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.030 
liked it since I got the one for my
droid<00:02:18.250> charge<00:02:18.730> just<00:02:19.599> a<00:02:19.750> much<00:02:19.989> sleeker<00:02:20.470> nicer

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
droid charge just a much sleeker nicer

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.100 
droid charge just a much sleeker nicer
look<00:02:21.280> than<00:02:21.519> what<00:02:21.549> Motorola<00:02:22.090> offers<00:02:22.720> but<00:02:22.900> again

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
look than what Motorola offers but again

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.570 
look than what Motorola offers but again
this<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:23.440> piece<00:02:23.680> of<00:02:23.709> plastic<00:02:24.220> part<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.519> the

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
this is a piece of plastic part of the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.860 
this is a piece of plastic part of the
reason<00:02:24.819> it's<00:02:24.940> nice<00:02:25.090> to<00:02:25.209> be<00:02:25.239> able<00:02:25.390> to<00:02:25.540> get<00:02:25.690> this

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
reason it's nice to be able to get this

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.990 
reason it's nice to be able to get this
at<00:02:26.019> such<00:02:26.530> a<00:02:26.560> low<00:02:26.860> price<00:02:26.890> considering<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.849> is

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
at such a low price considering it is

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.570 
at such a low price considering it is
extraordinarily<00:02:28.680> similar<00:02:29.680> to<00:02:30.129> Samsung's

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
extraordinarily similar to Samsung's

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.910 
extraordinarily similar to Samsung's
other<00:02:30.879> docs<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.870> they<00:02:31.989> go<00:02:32.140> ahead<00:02:32.349> and<00:02:32.500> connect

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
other docs so they go ahead and connect

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.199 
other docs so they go ahead and connect
this<00:02:33.580> so<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:34.629> we<00:02:34.660> actually<00:02:35.099> have<00:02:36.099> this<00:02:36.340> ready

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
this so that we actually have this ready

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.360 
this so that we actually have this ready
to<00:02:37.329> go<00:02:37.510> so<00:02:37.720> it<00:02:37.780> just<00:02:37.930> snaps<00:02:38.200> in<00:02:38.470> like<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:38.890> you

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
to go so it just snaps in like that you

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.100 
to go so it just snaps in like that you
can<00:02:39.549> mount<00:02:39.730> this<00:02:39.909> obviously<00:02:40.480> either<00:02:40.780> way

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
can mount this obviously either way

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.710 
can mount this obviously either way
depending<00:02:42.040> on<00:02:42.430> how<00:02:42.610> you<00:02:42.670> want<00:02:42.819> it<00:02:43.180> for

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
depending on how you want it for

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.350 
depending on how you want it for
orientation<00:02:44.590> purposes<00:02:45.340> and<00:02:45.819> let's<00:02:45.940> go<00:02:46.090> ahead

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
orientation purposes and let's go ahead

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.849 
orientation purposes and let's go ahead
and<00:02:46.690> pull<00:02:47.680> down<00:02:47.859> the<00:02:48.129> charging<00:02:49.859> component

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
and pull down the charging component

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:52.530 
and pull down the charging component
that<00:02:50.920> you<00:02:51.250> essentially<00:02:51.609> just<00:02:51.849> snap<00:02:52.120> in<00:02:52.390> and

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
that you essentially just snap in and

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.319 
that you essentially just snap in and
let's<00:02:52.690> see<00:02:52.900> if<00:02:53.170> this<00:02:53.440> fits<00:02:53.730> again<00:02:54.730> from<00:02:55.030> what

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:55.329 
let's see if this fits again from what

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:57.330 
let's see if this fits again from what
I've<00:02:55.510> read<00:02:55.780> it<00:02:56.049> seems<00:02:56.349> that<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.829> does<00:02:57.040> fit

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
I've read it seems that it does fit

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.170 
I've read it seems that it does fit
properly<00:02:57.579> so<00:02:58.209> I'm<00:02:58.510> hoping<00:02:59.340> that<00:03:00.340> we<00:03:00.940> stay<00:03:01.150> in

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
properly so I'm hoping that we stay in

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.420 
properly so I'm hoping that we stay in
theme<00:03:01.510> looks<00:03:01.959> like<00:03:02.140> it<00:03:02.290> snapped<00:03:02.590> in<00:03:02.859> pretty

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
theme looks like it snapped in pretty

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.380 
theme looks like it snapped in pretty
firmly<00:03:03.879> here<00:03:04.239> steady<00:03:05.040> boom<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.310> yep<00:03:07.090> perfect

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
firmly here steady boom and yep perfect

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.240 
firmly here steady boom and yep perfect
fit<00:03:07.780> from<00:03:08.140> what<00:03:08.260> I<00:03:08.290> can<00:03:08.379> tell<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.890> phone<00:03:09.069> just

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
fit from what I can tell the phone just

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.970 
fit from what I can tell the phone just
vibrated<00:03:09.340> it's<00:03:10.090> powering<00:03:10.510> up<00:03:10.780> so<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.680> looks

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
vibrated it's powering up so it looks

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.250 
vibrated it's powering up so it looks
like<00:03:12.129> we<00:03:12.700> have<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.940> winner<00:03:13.030> folks<00:03:13.510> as<00:03:13.780> I

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
like we have a winner folks as I

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.530 
like we have a winner folks as I
mentioned<00:03:14.290> before<00:03:14.819> no<00:03:15.819> holes<00:03:16.060> on<00:03:16.299> the<00:03:16.389> back

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
mentioned before no holes on the back

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.500 
mentioned before no holes on the back
for<00:03:16.780> anything<00:03:17.019> other<00:03:17.349> than<00:03:17.739> the<00:03:18.069> camera<00:03:18.880> so

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
for anything other than the camera so

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.970 
for anything other than the camera so
it's<00:03:20.079> certainly<00:03:20.319> going<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.650> muffle

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
it's certainly going to muffle

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.670 
it's certainly going to muffle
speakerphone<00:03:21.459> I'll<00:03:21.700> let<00:03:21.880> you<00:03:21.970> guys<00:03:22.150> know<00:03:22.680> well

maybe<00:03:23.859> not<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:24.190> much<00:03:24.370> that<00:03:24.579> audio<00:03:24.849> sounded

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
maybe not so much that audio sounded

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.240 
maybe not so much that audio sounded
decent<00:03:25.389> I'll<00:03:25.959> let<00:03:26.169> you<00:03:26.230> know<00:03:26.290> as<00:03:26.590> I<00:03:26.620> use<00:03:27.069> it

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.250 
decent I'll let you know as I use it
more<00:03:27.459> but<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.120> looks<00:03:28.599> like<00:03:28.810> we<00:03:28.959> have<00:03:29.079> a<00:03:29.139> winner

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
thought it would definitely be a useful
