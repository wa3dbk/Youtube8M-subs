while to get through them all and Cuomo

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.069 
while to get through them all and Cuomo
to<00:01:32.680> salvage<00:01:33.130> get<00:01:33.369> so<00:01:33.640> I<00:01:33.670> recommend<00:01:33.970> buying<00:01:34.750> a

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
to salvage get so I recommend buying a

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.649 
to salvage get so I recommend buying a
lot<00:01:35.649> more<00:01:35.799> than<00:01:35.860> you<00:01:36.040> need<00:01:36.189> because<00:01:37.030> you<00:01:37.270> these

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:37.659 
lot more than you need because you these

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:39.450 
lot more than you need because you these
are<00:01:37.869> crude<00:01:38.170> Salvage<00:01:38.560> kits<00:01:38.799> because<00:01:39.040> the

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
are crude Salvage kits because the

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.219 
are crude Salvage kits because the
sandwich<00:01:40.270> kit<00:01:40.509> level<00:01:40.780> doesn't<00:01:40.960> actually

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
sandwich kit level doesn't actually

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.289 
sandwich kit level doesn't actually
affect<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.920> luck<00:01:42.100> you<00:01:42.130> get<00:01:42.490> only<00:01:42.729> the<00:01:43.030> other
