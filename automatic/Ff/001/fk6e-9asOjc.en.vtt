right little big deal as you see I had
this<00:01:06.450> big<00:01:06.990> problem<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.680> with<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.200> CDI

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
this big problem here with the CDI

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.760 
this big problem here with the CDI
ignition<00:01:10.500> system<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.520> had<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.540> splice<00:01:13.530> some

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
ignition system I had to splice some

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.880 
ignition system I had to splice some
wires<00:01:13.979> make<00:01:14.430> new<00:01:14.640> wires<00:01:14.880> because<00:01:18.830> before<00:01:19.830> I

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
wires make new wires because before I

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.749 
wires make new wires because before I
thought<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:21.000> was<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:22.170> motor<00:01:22.979> winner<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.369> run<00:01:23.520> I

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
thought it was the motor winner to run I

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.340 
thought it was the motor winner to run I
thought<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.240> wasn't<00:01:24.420> getting<00:01:24.720> any<00:01:24.840> spark<00:01:25.110> but

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
thought I wasn't getting any spark but

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.800 
thought I wasn't getting any spark but
it<00:01:25.470> turned<00:01:25.680> out<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.860> be<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:27.060> kill<00:01:27.540> switch

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
it turned out to be the kill switch

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.039 
it turned out to be the kill switch
ground<00:01:28.740> inside<00:01:29.700> here<00:01:30.060> was<00:01:30.270> this<00:01:30.570> is<00:01:30.750> actually

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
ground inside here was this is actually

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.749 
ground inside here was this is actually
a<00:01:31.110> new<00:01:31.229> throttle<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:32.189> new<00:01:32.340> kill<00:01:32.520> switch

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
a new throttle the new kill switch

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.120 
a new throttle the new kill switch
because<00:01:32.909> before<00:01:33.270> I<00:01:33.329> made<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.229> big<00:01:34.439> mistake<00:01:34.590> by

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
because before I made a big mistake by

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.460 
because before I made a big mistake by
spraying<00:01:35.520> wd40<00:01:36.270> into<00:01:36.450> there<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:37.259> messed

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
spraying wd40 into there and it messed

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.700 
spraying wd40 into there and it messed
up<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:38.060> kill<00:01:39.060> switch<00:01:39.360> ground<00:01:39.659> in<00:01:39.840> there<00:01:40.020> not

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
up the kill switch ground in there not

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.760 
up the kill switch ground in there not
the<00:01:40.860> ground<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.250> mean<00:01:41.430> my<00:01:41.610> bad<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.619> padded<00:01:43.619> wall

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the ground I mean my bad the padded wall

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.190 
the ground I mean my bad the padded wall
little<00:01:44.130> firewall<00:01:44.549> in<00:01:44.700> there<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.780> basically

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
little firewall in there so basically

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.480 
little firewall in there so basically
all<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.560> time<00:01:46.740> when<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:46.950> would<00:01:47.100> try<00:01:47.189> and<00:01:47.280> start

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
all the time when I would try and start

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.240 
all the time when I would try and start
the<00:01:47.640> motor<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:48.810> would<00:01:49.049> not<00:01:49.259> let<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.740> run<00:01:49.890> it

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
the motor it would not let it run it

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.149 
the motor it would not let it run it
would<00:01:50.399> not<00:01:50.689> say<00:01:51.689> what<00:01:51.840> all<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.170> was<00:01:52.619> always

purchasing a new bike soon it it's going
to<00:02:17.290> be<00:02:17.410> close<00:02:17.650> to<00:02:17.680> the<00:02:17.980> spice<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.430> same<00:02:18.640> bike

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
to be close to the spice the same bike

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.480 
to be close to the spice the same bike
but<00:02:19.380> just<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.470> little<00:02:20.620> different<00:02:21.040> with<00:02:21.190> gears

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
but just a little different with gears

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.430 
but just a little different with gears
you<00:02:21.700> know<00:02:21.790> here's<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.390> where<00:02:23.080> I<00:02:23.140> drilled

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
you know here's the where I drilled

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.440 
you know here's the where I drilled
through<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.710> frame<00:02:24.750> so<00:02:27.210> hopefully<00:02:28.210> this<00:02:28.300> will

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
through the frame so hopefully this will

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.650 
through the frame so hopefully this will
