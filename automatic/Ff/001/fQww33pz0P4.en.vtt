so now this is your base and this will

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:42.510 
so now this is your base and this will
be<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:40.150> fading<00:01:40.509> door<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:42.130> want<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.340> go<00:01:42.430> on

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
tools then you want to go on the first

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.749 
tools then you want to go on the first
of<00:01:47.560> all<00:01:47.650> you<00:01:47.740> want<00:01:47.860> to<00:01:47.920> make<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.130> fading<00:01:48.460> also

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
of all you want to make the fading also

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.190 
of all you want to make the fading also
going<00:01:48.909> you're<00:01:49.060> fading<00:01:49.240> doors<00:01:49.600> now<00:01:49.899> this<00:01:50.080> is

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
going you're fading doors now this is

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.270 
going you're fading doors now this is
probably<00:01:50.350> going<00:01:50.530> to<00:01:50.590> be<00:01:50.649> different<00:01:50.830> most

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:51.280 
probably going to be different most

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.690 
probably going to be different most
service<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:53.140> assign<00:01:53.710> the<00:01:53.890> letter<00:01:54.070> you<00:01:54.280> wish<00:01:54.460> I

service now assign the letter you wish I

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.969 
service now assign the letter you wish I
I've<00:01:55.270> chosen<00:01:55.659> em<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:57.250> you<00:01:57.850> click<00:01:58.479> on<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.690> door

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
I've chosen em and you click on the door

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.139 
I've chosen em and you click on the door
now<00:01:59.979> I<00:02:00.009> should<00:02:00.399> say<00:02:00.549> that<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.850> dogs<00:02:01.000> been

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
now I should say that the dogs been

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:05.850 
now I should say that the dogs been
created<00:02:01.619> then<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:03.040> gon<00:02:03.220> keypads<00:02:04.470> you<00:02:05.470> make<00:02:05.679> a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
created then you gon keypads you make a

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:13.770 
created then you gon keypads you make a
code<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:07.119> let's<00:02:07.600> just<00:02:07.750> have<00:02:10.350> 1331<00:02:12.510> make<00:02:13.510> the

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
code so let's just have 1331 make the

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.300 
code so let's just have 1331 make the
access<00:02:14.290> granted<00:02:14.860> the<00:02:15.250> same<00:02:15.580> as<00:02:16.950> the<00:02:17.950> fading

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
access granted the same as the fading

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.400 
access granted the same as the fading
door<00:02:18.489> so<00:02:18.790> M<00:02:19.410> these<00:02:20.410> are<00:02:20.590> just<00:02:20.620> optional<00:02:22.410> and

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
door so M these are just optional and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.259 
door so M these are just optional and
this<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:23.800> how<00:02:23.920> long<00:02:24.100> it<00:02:24.160> holds<00:02:24.670> after<00:02:24.880> you

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
this is how long it holds after you

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.210 
this is how long it holds after you
press<00:02:25.420> it<00:02:25.480> you<00:02:26.230> can<00:02:26.500> increase<00:02:26.950> or<00:02:26.980> decrease

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
press it you can increase or decrease

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.699 
press it you can increase or decrease
step<00:02:27.670> and<00:02:27.930> then<00:02:28.930> you'd<00:02:29.170> put<00:02:29.200> that<00:02:29.530> wherever

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
step and then you'd put that wherever

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.830 
step and then you'd put that wherever
you<00:02:30.010> wish<00:02:30.160> it<00:02:30.340> advisable<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.300> put<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.569> next<00:02:31.690> to

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
you wish it advisable to put it next to

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.460 
you wish it advisable to put it next to
the<00:02:31.900> door<00:02:33.209> now<00:02:34.209> if<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.480> type<00:02:34.630> in<00:02:34.750> the<00:02:34.780> code

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.190 

should<00:02:39.160> work<00:02:39.370> and<00:02:40.030> then<00:02:40.240> you<00:02:40.600> go<00:02:40.720> through<00:02:40.750> and

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
should work and then you go through and

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.800 
should work and then you go through and
you<00:02:41.260> put<00:02:41.500> one<00:02:41.620> on<00:02:41.740> this<00:02:41.890> side<00:02:42.100> and<00:02:42.720> there<00:02:43.720> you

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
you put one on this side and there you

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.190 
you put one on this side and there you
have<00:02:43.840> your<00:02:43.990> failing<00:02:44.500> go<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:46.360> now<00:02:46.540> basically

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:47.200 
have your failing go and now basically

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.590 
have your failing go and now basically
have<00:02:47.530> another<00:02:47.800> door<00:02:48.040> to<00:02:48.370> stop<00:02:49.030> people<00:02:49.180> getting

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:49.600 
have another door to stop people getting

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.690 
have another door to stop people getting
in<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.520> they<00:02:51.520> can<00:02:51.730> use<00:02:51.760> keypad<00:02:52.300> crackers<00:02:52.750> but

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
in and they can use keypad crackers but

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.120 
in and they can use keypad crackers but
you<00:02:54.700> can<00:02:54.850> make<00:02:55.030> even<00:02:55.270> more<00:02:55.420> doors<00:02:55.900> so<00:02:56.890> it's

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
you can make even more doors so it's

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:59.700 
you can make even more doors so it's
hard<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.640> get<00:02:57.760> through<00:02:58.260> make<00:02:59.260> sure<00:02:59.290> you're

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
only have to use fading doors you can

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.810 
only have to use fading doors you can
also<00:03:15.970> make<00:03:16.300> a<00:03:16.690> storage<00:03:17.410> for<00:03:17.709> your<00:03:17.740> weapons<00:03:18.370> so
