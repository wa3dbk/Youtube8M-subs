00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hi folks who help the literary environment and 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.870
 Today I'm going to show you what I walk. 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.880
 reading in the winter literary marathon 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.860
 because that's when I was thinking during 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.009
 week and want to make videos 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.480
 weekly if I can at least get there 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.940
 showing you what I'm 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.310
 getting law as it is being and 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.769
 time is running out and if it really is 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.019
 yielding what I'm reading I had a 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.199
 week because it was the last 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.240
 week before the recess of school I 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.780
 I am now in the week of the recess has no 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.670
 a week off from vacation like this 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.620
 school that the work is not 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.390
 so during this week I'm going 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.860
 get enough more last week 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.170
 was very hard because it was the last 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.000
 week had gang had party 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.910
 farewell to a lot of thing 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.649
 Finally it turned out I could read two 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.930
 books anyway so I was super 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.449
 satisfied but during the week it went well 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.520
 Second type run where nothing I think and 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.410
 20 and 30 pages on Tuesday he well 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.230
 bit also when it was on Wednesday 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.629
 Monday I had read 70 pages, right? 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.439
 in the same intervals as the central school 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.790
 of disgust and then on Wednesday to the 280 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.760
 pages 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.780
 Everything excites me tomorrow, I can do it. 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.850
 Then I read the 350 of the prize 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.409
 sanctions which was the first book I 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.270
 I put this problem in the first 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.610
 week because they in the category of 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.799
 fantasy or fantasy dystopia fiction 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.780
 I could read this here. 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.150
 for fantasy and I was very 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.390
 satisfied I loved the book I'm already 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.490
 recording video example you then in 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.829
 soon you will know in detail the 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.509
 I found this book but but 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.240
 really someone who is really fancy 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.649
 had mystical supernatural elements 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.619
 creatures, right? 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.470
 although the focus is the battle of war 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.270
 just nobody anyway but I really love it 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.939
 so I'll tell you later that 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.890
 I actually found the book but it's a book. 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.900
 It's beautiful, amazing, I took several photos. 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.000
 also to show it to you 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.520
 they are because I really found it perfect 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.130
 very beautiful and there was even if he 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.930
 fourth only so fifth and sixth are 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.600
 days run hard for me because the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.649
 I work from 7 to 18 7 in the morning at 18 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.500
 hours 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.110
 so I stay all day on the street outside 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.480
 I entered the gym last week 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.400
 so I was very much running there 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.260
 Thursday and Friday I had the gym night 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.090
 then hair in addition to 18 hours of 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.770
 I did not go to the gym, I went back to 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.960
 make dinner as a bath some things 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.310
 I finally got out on Thursday and I got it right. 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.080
 little 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.230
 on Friday also because I 'm beautiful in the 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.450
 breaks at school so between a 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:39.750
 class and other vacant schedules I had 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.330
 water boy and then I think I 'll get 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:45.690
 with 120 pages or so in that 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.550
 on these two days it's not the fifth and sixth 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.730
 when there arrived Saturday I had read 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.600
 only 120 pages of small and large 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.390
 lies in the wet area and not there Saturday 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.670
 A little bit more but without me I think 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:03.090
 on sunday he kind 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:04.890
 I think about 80 people lost there 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.739
 the bills but I know there is Yes Saturday 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.870
 I could not read any more Saturday - Sunday 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:13.560
 he rather with a hundred and few failures 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.320
 almost 200 pages and so, yes, there I 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.780
 I managed to finish a book that has 400 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:22.410
 pages then so it is incredible that 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.110
 It seems not just to look and if you have 350 00 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.989
 so he got this fifth 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:30.780
 Sunday, you could not finish yesterday. 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:33.480
 so he these two books in the first 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.130

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.350

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.010
 beats the secret of my 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:46.140
 husband is another author's book. 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.850
 I know which one I liked the most, I do not know. 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.230

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.690

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.530

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:02.060
 It was so I will begin the second week 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.000

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:07.250
 Technical he comes here in the category of 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.310

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.560
 one 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.389
 to win a game because I 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.040
 They spoke you see selling if you have 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:47.690
 that read with calm attention 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.450
 not sure but if you already have 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.580

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:55.010
 Please, to get ready. 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.990
 Anyway, I intend to read four 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.850
 week books if I can 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:01.030
 I 'll already have gone six cylinders in. 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.210
 of July is so great 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:04.400
 sensational 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.650
 so if I can do it in the other weeks 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.870
 I'll try and just keep the risk of reading two 

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.419
 per week normally I always read 11 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.500
 can not two as I got in 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:15.200

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.050
 at the end of brass got 10 he then 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.440

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:24.169
 like that, perfect kind of people 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.850
 Now, if I can or not, there are 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:28.700
 another five hundred but not 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:30.350

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:31.220
 showing that they also respond that 

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:33.680
 so do not 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.110
