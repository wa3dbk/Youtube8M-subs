00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
much I just try to focus on what we can

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.560 
much I just try to focus on what we can
do<00:03:32.070> next<00:03:32.220> to<00:03:32.400> win<00:03:32.579> and<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.820> like<00:03:33.090> really<00:03:33.299> like

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
do next to win and that like really like

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.229 
do next to win and that like really like
get<00:03:34.230> bogged<00:03:34.470> down<00:03:34.620> on<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:35.280> bot<00:03:35.519> lanes<00:03:35.730> losing<00:03:36.120> or

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
get bogged down on a bot lanes losing or

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.449 
get bogged down on a bot lanes losing or
bottlings<00:03:36.630> doing<00:03:37.410> poorly<00:03:37.680> if<00:03:38.040> they're<00:03:38.250> doing

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
bottlings doing poorly if they're doing

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.099 
bottlings doing poorly if they're doing
great<00:03:38.700> then<00:03:38.910> that's<00:03:39.090> great<00:03:39.299> but<00:03:39.900> if<00:03:39.989> they're

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
great then that's great but if they're

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:41.509 
great then that's great but if they're
doing<00:03:40.260> poorly<00:03:40.500> then<00:03:40.709> that's<00:03:40.920> when<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.340> want

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
doing poorly then that's when you want

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.039 
doing poorly then that's when you want
to<00:03:41.579> try<00:03:41.700> to<00:03:41.760> like<00:03:41.970> boost<00:03:42.510> up<00:03:42.780> their<00:03:42.900> morale

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:43.049 
to try to like boost up their morale

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:45.440 
to try to like boost up their morale
because<00:03:43.320> when<00:03:44.250> a<00:03:44.280> teammate's<00:03:44.609> doing<00:03:44.820> bad<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
because when a teammate's doing bad the

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.550 
because when a teammate's doing bad the
first<00:03:45.660> thing<00:03:45.810> they<00:03:45.900> want<00:03:46.049> to<00:03:46.079> do<00:03:46.200> is<00:03:46.350> shut<00:03:46.530> down

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
first thing they want to do is shut down

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:47.780 
first thing they want to do is shut down
so<00:03:46.950> you<00:03:47.010> want<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.370> make<00:03:47.400> sure<00:03:47.519> that<00:03:47.760> doesn't

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
so you want to make sure that doesn't

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.390 
so you want to make sure that doesn't
happen<00:03:48.060> so<00:03:48.510> I<00:03:48.750> don't<00:03:49.440> try<00:03:49.799> to<00:03:49.829> let<00:03:50.070> it<00:03:50.100> get<00:03:50.250> to

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
happen so I don't try to let it get to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.440 
happen so I don't try to let it get to
me<00:03:50.430> and<00:03:50.579> I<00:03:50.640> hope<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.910> doesn't<00:03:51.120> get<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.299> them<00:03:51.420> as

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
me and I hope it doesn't get to them as

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:52.849 
me and I hope it doesn't get to them as
well<00:03:51.570> I<00:03:51.840> don't<00:03:52.109> have<00:03:52.260> from<00:03:52.410> a<00:03:52.470> kind<00:03:52.650> of<00:03:52.709> same

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:54.229 
well I don't have from a kind of same
question<00:03:53.280> we<00:03:53.370> know<00:03:53.459> top<00:03:53.670> laners<00:03:54.000> can<00:03:54.120> get

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
question we know top laners can get

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.940 
question we know top laners can get
really<00:03:54.630> big<00:03:54.930> and<00:03:55.109> pretty<00:03:55.320> much<00:03:55.410> take<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:55.799> game

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
really big and pretty much take the game

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.020 
really big and pretty much take the game
on<00:03:56.100> their<00:03:56.220> shoulders<00:03:56.549> what's<00:03:56.760> it<00:03:56.880> like<00:03:56.970> being

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
on their shoulders what's it like being

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.120 
on their shoulders what's it like being
down<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.480> bottom<00:03:57.720> latency<00:03:58.079> Oh<00:03:58.230> Bobby<00:03:58.799> Wayne

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
down the bottom latency Oh Bobby Wayne

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.270 
down the bottom latency Oh Bobby Wayne
uh<00:03:59.640> for<00:04:00.450> top<00:04:00.630> pointers<00:04:01.049> I<00:04:01.350> just<00:04:01.799> hope<00:04:02.010> that

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
uh for top pointers I just hope that

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.150 
uh for top pointers I just hope that
they<00:04:03.000> don't<00:04:03.299> snowball<00:04:04.109> it's<00:04:04.709> pretty<00:04:04.890> much<00:04:04.980> it

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
they don't snowball it's pretty much it

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.949 
they don't snowball it's pretty much it
and<00:04:05.489> usually<00:04:05.880> I<00:04:06.120> don't<00:04:06.269> see<00:04:06.480> the<00:04:06.510> top<00:04:06.720> laner

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
and usually I don't see the top laner

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.479 
and usually I don't see the top laner
until<00:04:07.260> I<00:04:07.350> 20<00:04:07.650> minutes<00:04:07.890> into<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:08.130> game<00:04:08.160> maybe

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
until I 20 minutes into the game maybe

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.309 
until I 20 minutes into the game maybe
they<00:04:08.640> come<00:04:08.790> down<00:04:08.940> for<00:04:09.120> dragon<00:04:09.450> but<00:04:09.600> other<00:04:10.079> than

anything<00:04:28.980> to<00:04:29.550> handle<00:04:29.880> that<00:04:30.030> or<00:04:30.240> are<00:04:30.510> you<00:04:30.600> just

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
anything to handle that or are you just

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.930 
anything to handle that or are you just
going<00:04:30.960> to<00:04:31.200> you<00:04:31.710> know<00:04:31.800> try<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.280> take<00:04:32.460> all<00:04:32.670> the

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
going to you know try and take all the

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.690 
going to you know try and take all the
attention<00:04:33.570> um<00:04:34.530> I<00:04:34.620> think<00:04:34.800> honestly<00:04:35.460> it<00:04:35.610> was

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
attention um I think honestly it was

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.520 
attention um I think honestly it was
just<00:04:35.880> not<00:04:36.150> necessarily<00:04:36.720> them<00:04:36.840> I<00:04:37.020> knew<00:04:37.410> they

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
just not necessarily them I knew they

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.750 
just not necessarily them I knew they
put<00:04:37.650> a<00:04:37.710> lot<00:04:37.830> of<00:04:37.860> pressure<00:04:38.130> on<00:04:38.250> me<00:04:38.370> but<00:04:38.520> I<00:04:38.550> think

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
put a lot of pressure on me but I think

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:40.160 
put a lot of pressure on me but I think
it<00:04:38.820> was<00:04:38.880> just<00:04:38.940> me<00:04:39.210> playing<00:04:39.390> poorly<00:04:39.780> i<00:04:39.930> could

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
it was just me playing poorly i could

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.200 
it was just me playing poorly i could
have<00:04:40.260> reacted<00:04:40.680> better<00:04:40.770> the<00:04:41.100> rotations<00:04:41.940> and

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
have reacted better the rotations and

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.120 
have reacted better the rotations and
the<00:04:42.360> ganks<00:04:42.960> coming<00:04:43.200> my<00:04:43.320> way<00:04:43.350> shipped<00:04:43.770> or<00:04:43.920> even

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
the ganks coming my way shipped or even

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.980 
the ganks coming my way shipped or even
called<00:04:44.340> Lulu's<00:04:44.880> coming<00:04:45.210> up<00:04:45.360> Lulu<00:04:45.780> could<00:04:45.900> be

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
called Lulu's coming up Lulu could be

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.080 
called Lulu's coming up Lulu could be
coming<00:04:46.260> up<00:04:46.350> and<00:04:46.500> that<00:04:47.130> I<00:04:47.190> hadn't<00:04:47.610> backed<00:04:47.730> up<00:04:47.970> in

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
coming up and that I hadn't backed up in

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.580 
coming up and that I hadn't backed up in
time<00:04:48.240> and<00:04:48.390> that<00:04:48.510> was<00:04:48.540> the<00:04:48.780> reason<00:04:48.810> I<00:04:49.080> died<00:04:49.260> so<00:04:49.560> I

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
time and that was the reason I died so I

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.980 
time and that was the reason I died so I
think<00:04:49.710> even<00:04:50.220> though<00:04:50.580> extra<00:04:51.150> attention<00:04:51.450> is<00:04:51.720> put

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
think even though extra attention is put

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.140 
think even though extra attention is put
top<00:04:52.230> it's<00:04:52.530> up<00:04:52.920> to<00:04:53.070> me<00:04:53.190> to<00:04:53.220> just<00:04:53.460> play<00:04:53.700> smarter

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
top it's up to me to just play smarter

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:57.560 
top it's up to me to just play smarter
and<00:04:54.300> play<00:04:54.480> a<00:04:54.510> safer<00:04:54.960> game<00:04:55.140> if<00:04:55.320> need<00:04:55.560> be<00:04:56.120> and<00:04:57.120> you

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:57.570 
and play a safer game if need be and you

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.810 
and play a safer game if need be and you
know<00:04:57.660> if<00:04:58.290> remove<00:04:58.620> what<00:04:58.800> does<00:04:58.950> CLG<00:04:59.460> look<00:04:59.640> at

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:01.230 
when they play against coast kind of

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:03.020 
when they play against coast kind of
what<00:05:01.350> are<00:05:01.440> the<00:05:01.500> factors<00:05:01.890> you<00:05:02.070> guys<00:05:02.220> take<00:05:02.640> under

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
what are the factors you guys take under

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.580 
what are the factors you guys take under
consideration<00:05:03.060> before<00:05:03.780> going<00:05:04.140> up<00:05:04.320> against

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
consideration before going up against

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.370 
consideration before going up against
them<00:05:04.710> um<00:05:05.120> pretty<00:05:06.120> much<00:05:06.300> play<00:05:06.810> standard

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
them um pretty much play standard

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.570 
them um pretty much play standard
because<00:05:07.530> coast<00:05:07.920> is<00:05:08.070> really<00:05:08.340> good<00:05:08.460> at

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
because coast is really good at

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.100 
because coast is really good at
snowballing<00:05:08.910> and<00:05:09.120> as<00:05:09.630> soon<00:05:09.720> as<00:05:09.870> they<00:05:09.960> get<00:05:10.080> a

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
snowballing and as soon as they get a

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.870 
snowballing and as soon as they get a
lead<00:05:10.290> they're<00:05:10.560> really<00:05:10.710> good<00:05:10.950> at<00:05:11.100> capitalizing

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
lead they're really good at capitalizing
