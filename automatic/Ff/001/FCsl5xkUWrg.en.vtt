both<00:01:17.500> of<00:01:17.530> their<00:01:17.830> moves<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:19.060> there's<00:01:19.479> just

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:19.540 
both of their moves but there's just

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:21.810 
both of their moves but there's just
something<00:01:19.990> about<00:01:20.130> sub-zero<00:01:21.130> that<00:01:21.490> I<00:01:21.520> really

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
something about sub-zero that I really

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.230

like<00:01:22.680> he<00:01:23.680> freezes<00:01:24.100> people<00:01:24.670> then<00:01:24.820> you<00:01:24.909> go<00:01:25.060> give

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
like he freezes people then you go give

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.320

a<00:01:25.270> nice<00:01:25.509> filthy<00:01:26.320> uppercut<00:01:26.970> but<00:01:27.970> this<00:01:28.150> was

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.330 
a nice filthy uppercut but this was

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:29.970 
a nice filthy uppercut but this was
another<00:01:28.540> game<00:01:28.810> that<00:01:28.840> my<00:01:29.200> mom<00:01:29.440> definitely<00:01:29.710> did

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
another game that my mom definitely did

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.920 
another game that my mom definitely did
not<00:01:30.010> want<00:01:30.310> me<00:01:30.370> to<00:01:30.460> have<00:01:30.580> in<00:01:30.700> 1992<00:01:31.270> I<00:01:31.300> was<00:01:31.540> seven

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 
not want me to have in 1992 I was seven

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:33.330 
not want me to have in 1992 I was seven
so<00:01:32.080> I<00:01:32.110> did<00:01:32.290> not<00:01:32.410> have<00:01:32.590> this<00:01:32.740> game<00:01:32.950> I<00:01:32.980> didn't<00:01:33.250> get

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
so I did not have this game I didn't get

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.120 
so I did not have this game I didn't get
it<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.550> later<00:01:33.760> on<00:01:33.850> probably<00:01:34.210> in<00:01:34.360> the<00:01:34.420> late<00:01:34.510> 90s

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
it to later on probably in the late 90s

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.530 
it to later on probably in the late 90s
when<00:01:36.130> I<00:01:36.160> was<00:01:36.280> finally<00:01:36.430> allowed<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:37.060> get<00:01:37.330> it<00:01:37.450> and

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
when I was finally allowed to get it and

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.690 
when I was finally allowed to get it and
play<00:01:37.780> it<00:01:37.810> and<00:01:38.080> you<00:01:38.860> know<00:01:38.980> I<00:01:39.040> think<00:01:39.370> the<00:01:39.460> biggest

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
play it and you know I think the biggest

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.730 
play it and you know I think the biggest
reason<00:01:39.880> why<00:01:40.330> we<00:01:40.510> love<00:01:40.690> this<00:01:40.750> game<00:01:41.080> as<00:01:41.260> a<00:01:41.290> kid<00:01:41.380> it

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
reason why we love this game as a kid it

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.649 
reason why we love this game as a kid it
was<00:01:42.220> karate<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.940> I<00:01:43.030> know<00:01:43.120> I'm<00:01:43.300> probably<00:01:43.420> gonna

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:43.659 
was karate and I know I'm probably gonna

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:44.970 
was karate and I know I'm probably gonna
get<00:01:43.840> killed<00:01:44.110> for<00:01:44.320> saying<00:01:44.470> 'that's<00:01:44.650> karate

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
get killed for saying 'that's karate

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.010 
get killed for saying 'that's karate
it's<00:01:45.190> probably<00:01:45.460> something<00:01:45.700> more<00:01:46.020> something

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
it's probably something more something

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.649

something<00:01:47.740> much<00:01:48.250> more<00:01:48.550> sophisticated<00:01:48.790> than

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
something much more sophisticated than

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.750 
something much more sophisticated than
karate<00:01:50.409> like<00:01:50.680> jujitsu<00:01:51.220> or<00:01:51.370> something<00:01:51.640> like
