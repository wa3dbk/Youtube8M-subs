00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:32.199
 confusion I do not know, I do not know who you are 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:35.080

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:38.050
 your mother so 8 800 one hour all and 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:41.980

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.320
 those glasses approved the text is 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.469
 starring for even thinking I'm 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.410

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.840
 business to despair here from home 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:59.670
 bus just to fool pixote ask 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:01:01.570
 Sorry for the potatoes, my dreams. 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.460
 we left there that advantage 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.149
 Wonderful there at home for me 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.920

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.909

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.820
 alone in hands pastel number to the 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:19.360
 dinner was good but boring too 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:21.790
 It's there it's here, it's booming I think 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.130
 better there because today we only have us here 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.299
 also a beautiful table getting the 2 not 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.530
 that's exactly why I think it's best 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:27.520
 because I do not feel like being in 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.799
 nowhere else 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.950
 being here I do not want to 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.479
 to be in place of a place I am 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.369
 I think we should thank if 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.299
 there is a person who is above everything 

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.250
 is a creator 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.899

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.310

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:44.860
 I'm having with you, you're having 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.880
 with me 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.969
 the taste of caster for two people 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.280
 is lacking more $ 10 non- violence is 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:57.430
 where only for two people is the means to 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.840
 each there is no conducive environment exists 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.820
 a wheelchair for one person and two 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.710
 casters for two people and must 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.799
 left over because I and her mother Isabel 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:08.100
 we are a person we are just like that 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.680
 we were with one soul 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.180
 temporarily divided into two 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.660
 individualities of bodies such as 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.530
 we were a star exploding soul 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.290
 twin 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.580
 Siamese sister stars who won 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:27.880
 a set like infinity gives a dimension 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.290
 What romanticism that gave me a pipe to pay 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.209
 the cake 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.980
 Isabel never mind the world is ugly and 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.170
 does not understand how world is facing 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.230
 sincere and true love is to do 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:40.230
 inversions of I love you and in time 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.450
 emanuel showed a man and I have 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.750
 dreams I do not believe too that 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.140
 People are George arrives for you. 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:03:07.000
 consider that such then look and live and 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:09.680
 and I can say something 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.720
 that's where you 're doing well 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.720
 I think we've had a lot of fighting today. 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.780
 I know I 'm late 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.090
 but your hair has been clean applied 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:43.800
 We are well now it depends 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.650
 depends on what I 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:51.630
 You said that the poetry was written 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:56.780
 It's up to you to read the poetry for me. 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:04:00.120
 the coconut is a gossip lineu wellington 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:04.610
 Poetry music to me then just 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:08.750
 purpose I'm the law for you 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:12.560
 if you promise not to go there and neither 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.560
 I promise 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.550
 the boy 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:36.229
 your hairs are moving them in a loop 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:37.490
 My wishes exterminate my fears 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.110
 stay alone 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:41.110
 without your ways 

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:54.319
 You promised that I would not forgive you. 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:57.199
 sorry, there you go and look 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:05:00.199
 Combine in the op you did not want me to 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:05:06.139
 was more accessible 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:07.009
 God bless, I want you to be 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.210
 like this 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.210
 just like you 

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:23.300
 love is beautiful 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.530
 So many years of marriage and this kiss. 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.200
 in love 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:31.970
 of course , but within the people who 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.740
 loves and can not express his or her 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.350
 feelings you, for example, are well 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.250
 Crafted is just a way to see 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.380
 things 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.380
 I would say, for example, that you are 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.980
 shed too much as you are insensitive to 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:47.450
 in the discussions understood the discussions 

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.840
 are moments industries in the life of a 

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:49.700
 car 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.980
 sorry but I think we have 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.020
 that discuss our relationship 

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:56.360
 you need to expose to me your 

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.620
 my dissatisfaction has no satisfaction 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:59.600
 none 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:02.150
 but if you do not open how I 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:06.260
 I can improve align is in favor of 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:09.200
 worry about me and possible you stay 

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:12.800
 beautiful but only italy friend of 

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:14.540
 family also carries so much fighting never 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.230
 I went too, I'm on the flag too. 

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:22.030
 I want to return to play dad mother nor is 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.030
 one more family wants the card too.
