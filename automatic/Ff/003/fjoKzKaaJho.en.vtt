00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.210
 good afternoon today is March 29, 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.360
 2014 at the tip of the mountain ranges 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:12.389
 we have already passed almost all of the 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:16.030
 lot of chickens in the old farmyard 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:20.080
 where they had already consumed 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:22.750
 because the grass the different grass the 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.980
 different flora that there is at such a point 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.289
 where really 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.449
 if one does not take good care of it, what it generates is 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.430
 an erosion problem but the idea is 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.559
 that we're going to have the chickens in this 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.199
 been as we can see just entered 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.230
 the lot are curious 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:42.559
 they are very happy they are finding 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.930
 it turns out that there is enough food and the 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.230
 idea is that we are going to have these chickens 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.420
 of free grazing are chickens that 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.059
 they will feed on an average between 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.809
 about 10 or 15 percent of what the 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:00.710
 street find really insects 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.649
 level of worms and other herbs that 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.440
 consume them they will also be ordered 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:09.020
 to make the cut of the grass like 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.979
 we can see here although we still have 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:15.320
 a rooster that we stayed in the other corral 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.800
 you can already see the difference 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:21.860
 there is so big between the grass that there is in 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.290
 this side and the grass that has already been 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.770
 trimmed on the other side then 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.160
 for the glove compartment really is not any 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.740
 problem 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.400
 Even the animal takes care of 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.450
 dig around the dish that is 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.909
 the circle at the base of the tree where 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.219
 we have to keep clean 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.469
 this is the lot that we brought to the farm 

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:47.960
 the first of December that is already 

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:51.170
 It takes a few months and some of 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:53.740
 the hens are getting and are 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.049
 very healthy 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.009
 really the condition of these animals 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:02.200
 is optimal and here we go where is 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.860
 injuring Janet right here we go to 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:09.700
 leaving essentially the henhouse 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.640
 way that barely this lot where the 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.030
 we just pulled out as soon as I got back to 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:18.190
 grow the grass and here it starts to 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.680
 see that consumption reaches a point 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.470
 where we need to make the transfer 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.870
 we are going to transfer the birds to the hotel and 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.390
 later we will be using it near 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.799
 electrical that is the concept of chickens 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:37.200
 happy we are going to have about 5000 in a 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:39.989
 total of the 5 blocks in lots of a 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.040
 average when they are going to be fed 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.410
 additionally with the green forage 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.630
 hydroponic that we are going to produce here in 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.030
 the farm in the real one that really 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:51.940
 it's a thermal camera and from this 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:54.190
 we will talk in the next session but 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.690
 then from the mountain ranges I retire 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.790
 antioquia 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.790
 Have a good afternoon
