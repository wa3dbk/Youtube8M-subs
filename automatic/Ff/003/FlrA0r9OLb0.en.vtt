the<00:00:21.500> northwest<00:00:22.500> northeast<00:00:23.460> corner<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
the northwest northeast corner of the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.550 
the northwest northeast corner of the
map<00:00:26.390> I'm<00:00:27.390> probably<00:00:27.689> right<00:00:27.930> around<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.380> there

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
map I'm probably right around in there

computer<00:00:38.100> really<00:00:38.640> runs<00:00:39.360> very<00:00:39.780> well<00:00:40.020> while<00:00:40.710> in

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
computer really runs very well while in

computer really runs very well while in
town<00:00:41.899> I<00:00:42.899> get<00:00:43.379> around<00:00:43.649> 17<00:00:44.579> frames<00:00:45.469> just<00:00:46.469> by

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
town I get around 17 frames just by

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.450 
town I get around 17 frames just by
looking<00:00:47.039> around<00:00:47.160> up<00:00:47.520> here<00:00:49.039> I'll<00:00:50.039> show<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.280> my

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
isn't really like an ultra high setting

I was on I'm getting about 12 or 13
frames<00:01:55.570> per<00:01:55.869> second<00:01:56.320> while<00:01:56.710> recording<00:01:57.369> with

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
frames per second while recording with

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:05.219 
frames per second while recording with
fraps<00:02:02.399> it's<00:02:03.399> not<00:02:03.640> very<00:02:03.850> good<00:02:04.119> however<00:02:04.600> it<00:02:05.080> is

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
fraps it's not very good however it is

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:13.530 
fraps it's not very good however it is
with<00:02:05.440> fraps<00:02:05.770> it<00:02:06.100> would<00:02:06.250> be<00:02:06.399> about<00:02:06.610> 20<00:02:11.640> and<00:02:12.640> of

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
with fraps it would be about 20 and of

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.470 
with fraps it would be about 20 and of
course<00:02:13.840> there's<00:02:14.680> some<00:02:14.860> skipping<00:02:15.239> but<00:02:16.239> of

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
course there's some skipping but of

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.110 
course there's some skipping but of
course<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:16.930> can<00:02:17.079> always<00:02:17.579> turn<00:02:18.579> your<00:02:18.610> graphics

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
course you can always turn your graphics

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.640 
course you can always turn your graphics
down<00:02:19.329> for<00:02:20.049> the<00:02:20.140> framerate<00:02:20.940> if<00:02:21.940> you'd<00:02:22.150> rather

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
down for the framerate if you'd rather

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.729 
down for the framerate if you'd rather
have<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.860> frames<00:02:24.540> which<00:02:25.540> I<00:02:25.870> personally<00:02:26.530> would

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
have the frames which I personally would

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.800 
have the frames which I personally would
I<00:02:26.769> don't<00:02:26.980> think<00:02:27.340> there's<00:02:27.820> any<00:02:28.030> used<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.630> have

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:28.810 
I don't think there's any used to have

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.520 
I don't think there's any used to have
the<00:02:28.959> clouds

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:44.729 

show<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.280> without<00:02:34.670> the<00:02:34.850> clouds

00:02:44.729 --> 00:02:44.739 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.800 

made<00:02:45.400> it<00:02:45.579> a<00:02:45.670> little<00:02:45.790> brighter<00:02:46.090> out<00:02:48.629> and<00:02:49.629> see

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
made it a little brighter out and see

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:56.580 
made it a little brighter out and see
people<00:02:50.019> better

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.400 

this<00:02:56.980> is<00:02:57.540> with<00:02:58.540> version<00:02:59.730> let<00:03:00.730> me<00:03:00.880> look<00:03:01.030> here

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
this is with version let me look here

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:08.790 
this is with version let me look here
it's<00:03:02.410> forty<00:03:02.920> six<00:03:03.190> point<00:03:07.020> forty<00:03:08.020> six<00:03:08.230> point<00:03:08.470> one

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
it's forty six point forty six point one

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.870 
it's forty six point forty six point one
two<00:03:09.100> four<00:03:09.610> four<00:03:09.880> nine<00:03:09.910> zero<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.640> this<00:03:12.640> game<00:03:12.850> is

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
two four four nine zero and this game is

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.060 
two four four nine zero and this game is
still<00:03:13.420> an<00:03:13.570> alpha<00:03:13.780> so<00:03:14.290> like<00:03:15.070> it<00:03:15.520> could<00:03:15.700> run<00:03:15.910> a

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
still an alpha so like it could run a

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:22.950 
still an alpha so like it could run a
lot<00:03:18.070> better<00:03:18.310> like<00:03:18.700> later<00:03:18.940> on<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:21.190> just<00:03:21.970> keep<00:03:22.810> in

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:22.960 
lot better like later on so just keep in

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.720 
lot better like later on so just keep in
mind<00:03:23.170> when<00:03:23.560> this<00:03:23.740> video<00:03:23.890> is<00:03:24.190> made<00:03:24.460> and<00:03:26.730> what

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
mind when this video is made and what

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:36.740 
mind when this video is made and what
version<00:03:27.970> of<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:29.530> game<00:03:29.770> is

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.830 

I<00:03:36.920> will<00:03:37.920> also<00:03:38.670> post<00:03:39.000> a<00:03:39.270> benchmark<00:03:40.160> test<00:03:41.160> like<00:03:41.640> a

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:41.840 
I will also post a benchmark test like a

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.900 
I will also post a benchmark test like a
minimum<00:03:43.700> average<00:03:44.700> in<00:03:45.450> maximum<00:03:46.230> FPS<00:03:46.770> for<00:03:47.700> both

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
minimum average in maximum FPS for both

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.680 
minimum average in maximum FPS for both
in<00:03:48.240> town<00:03:48.510> in<00:03:48.780> out<00:03:49.050> and<00:03:49.760> I'll<00:03:50.760> put<00:03:50.820> the<00:03:51.300> in<00:03:51.450> town

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
in town in out and I'll put the in town

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.350 
in town in out and I'll put the in town
one<00:03:51.990> up<00:03:52.140> right<00:03:52.620> now<00:03:52.830> in<00:03:53.130> the<00:03:53.400> top<00:03:53.850> left<00:03:54.090> corner

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
one up right now in the top left corner

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.090 
one up right now in the top left corner
so<00:03:54.750> make<00:03:54.930> sure<00:03:54.960> you<00:03:55.140> have<00:03:55.260> your<00:03:55.350> annotations

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
so make sure you have your annotations

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.700 
so make sure you have your annotations
on<00:03:57.530> okay

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
on okay

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:00.770 
on okay
I'll<00:03:58.830> skip<00:03:59.190> to<00:03:59.250> some<00:03:59.700> out-of-town<00:04:00.030> footage

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
I'll skip to some out-of-town footage

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
I'll skip to some out-of-town footage
alright<00:04:01.380> guys<00:04:02.240> Here<00:04:03.240> I<00:04:03.270> am<00:04:03.390> out<00:04:03.660> in<00:04:03.900> some

running about 20 frames per second while

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.979 
running about 20 frames per second while
recording<00:04:18.030> it's<00:04:18.799> it's<00:04:19.799> around<00:04:20.040> 30<00:04:20.989> without

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:21.989

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:42.600 

all<00:04:35.440> right<00:04:38.370> yeah<00:04:39.370> it<00:04:39.639> it<00:04:40.060> runs<00:04:41.040> pretty<00:04:42.040> well<00:04:42.220> in

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
all right yeah it it runs pretty well in

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.680 
all right yeah it it runs pretty well in
the<00:04:42.699> country<00:04:43.150> I<00:04:43.900> have<00:04:45.300> gotten<00:04:46.300> even<00:04:46.360> better

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:46.690 
the country I have gotten even better

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.560 
the country I have gotten even better
frames<00:04:47.110> on<00:04:47.350> different<00:04:47.800> settings<00:04:48.330> I've<00:04:49.330> been

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
frames on different settings I've been

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.900 
frames on different settings I've been
in<00:04:49.720> like<00:04:50.110> the<00:04:50.289> 50s<00:04:50.740> and<00:04:50.889> 60s<00:04:50.949> out<00:04:51.669> in<00:04:51.820> the

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:51.910 
in like the 50s and 60s out in the

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:56.969 
in like the 50s and 60s out in the
country<00:04:52.300> here<00:04:52.539> so<00:04:54.419> as<00:04:55.419> long<00:04:55.630> as<00:04:55.810> you<00:04:55.979> change

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
the settings the game will run quite

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.450 
the settings the game will run quite
well<00:05:01.800> where<00:05:02.800> did<00:05:02.919> it<00:05:03.009> go

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:03.460 
well where did it go

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:11.070 
well where did it go
there<00:05:03.789> it<00:05:03.910> is

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.559 

just<00:05:12.080> making<00:05:12.349> sure<00:05:12.380> never<00:05:13.370> know<00:05:15.250> I<00:05:16.569> didn't

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:17.569 
just making sure never know I didn't

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:20.710 
just making sure never know I didn't
even<00:05:17.660> need<00:05:17.870> that<00:05:17.930> but<00:05:18.849> I<00:05:19.849> just<00:05:20.360> kind<00:05:20.539> of<00:05:20.569> want

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
to show you some of the terrain some of

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:31.210 
to show you some of the terrain some of
the<00:05:23.630> lighting<00:05:27.039> and<00:05:28.039> also<00:05:28.610> this<00:05:30.220> big-ass

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
the lighting and also this big-ass

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.040 
the lighting and also this big-ass
crater<00:05:32.060> like<00:05:32.389> thing<00:05:32.690> up<00:05:33.020> here<00:05:34.840> I'm<00:05:35.840> not<00:05:35.990> sure

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
crater like thing up here I'm not sure

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.279 
crater like thing up here I'm not sure
if<00:05:36.410> it's<00:05:36.590> new<00:05:37.130> or<00:05:37.430> just<00:05:37.940> new<00:05:38.630> to<00:05:38.810> me<00:05:39.020> but<00:05:39.229> I

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
if it's new or just new to me but I

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.629 
if it's new or just new to me but I
haven't<00:05:39.740> seen<00:05:40.099> it<00:05:40.960> until<00:05:41.960> this<00:05:42.380> latest<00:05:43.159> update

00:05:43.629 --> 00:05:43.639 
haven't seen it until this latest update

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:49.120 
haven't seen it until this latest update
so<00:05:46.720> it's<00:05:47.720> not<00:05:47.840> really<00:05:48.139> creator<00:05:48.500> its

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
so it's not really creator its

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.920 
so it's not really creator its
I<00:05:49.340> guess<00:05:49.970> Sanpei<00:05:50.509> a<00:05:50.539> gravel<00:05:51.139> pit<00:05:52.870> but<00:05:53.870> I

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
I guess Sanpei a gravel pit but I

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.689 
I guess Sanpei a gravel pit but I
thought<00:05:54.110> it<00:05:54.199> was<00:05:54.289> pretty<00:05:54.440> cool

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:57.699 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.179 

that's<00:05:58.270> a<00:05:58.599> really<00:05:59.050> long<00:05:59.379> ways<00:05:59.620> down<00:05:59.650> there

00:06:00.179 --> 00:06:00.189 
that's a really long ways down there

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:07.980 
that's a really long ways down there
it's<00:06:01.050> yeah<00:06:03.300> anyways<00:06:04.300> oh<00:06:06.539> there's<00:06:07.539> some<00:06:07.749> bad

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:07.990 
it's yeah anyways oh there's some bad

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:11.570 
it's yeah anyways oh there's some bad
skipping<00:06:08.469> there<00:06:09.509> mostly<00:06:10.509> because<00:06:10.779> of<00:06:10.960> fraps

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
skipping there mostly because of fraps

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.589 
skipping there mostly because of fraps
but<00:06:12.580> I<00:06:12.849> will<00:06:13.210> post<00:06:13.719> the<00:06:14.159> benchmark<00:06:15.159> for<00:06:15.550> out<00:06:16.330> of

00:06:16.589 --> 00:06:16.599 
but I will post the benchmark for out of

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:19.950 
but I will post the benchmark for out of
town<00:06:17.529> and<00:06:17.830> in<00:06:18.189> the<00:06:18.460> country<00:06:18.819> to<00:06:19.300> show<00:06:19.689> the

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:19.960 
town and in the country to show the

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:23.730 
town and in the country to show the
minimum<00:06:20.590> average<00:06:20.889> and<00:06:21.430> also<00:06:21.999> maximum<00:06:22.449> fps<00:06:23.080> at

minimum average and also maximum fps at

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.439 
minimum average and also maximum fps at
these<00:06:24.400> settings<00:06:24.909> so<00:06:26.849> yeah<00:06:27.849> thanks<00:06:28.419> for
