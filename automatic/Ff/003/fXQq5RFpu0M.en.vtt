pretty long I'm not used to the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.530 
pretty long I'm not used to the
all-black<00:01:16.250> anymore<00:01:16.880> because<00:01:16.970> it<00:01:17.150> had<00:01:17.300> color

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
all-black anymore because it had color

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.750

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
thinking about trimming these bangs to

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.750 
thinking about trimming these bangs to
cut<00:01:28.550> a<00:01:28.580> long<00:01:28.670> time<00:01:29.360> in<00:01:29.480> my<00:01:29.600> face<00:01:30.310> so<00:01:31.310> it's<00:01:31.640> going

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:31.760 
cut a long time in my face so it's going

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.060 
cut a long time in my face so it's going
to<00:01:31.910> take<00:01:32.030> my<00:01:32.180> razor<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.960> kind<00:01:33.470> of<00:01:33.530> from

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
to take my razor and kind of from

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.910 
to take my razor and kind of from
I<00:01:35.210> did<00:01:36.210> pull<00:01:36.480> it<00:01:36.510> back<00:01:36.750> some<00:01:37.110> sauce<00:01:37.380> on<00:01:37.530> my<00:01:37.710> hair

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
I did pull it back some sauce on my hair

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.130 
I did pull it back some sauce on my hair
is<00:01:38.040> showing<00:01:38.280> and<00:01:38.760> since<00:01:39.270> my<00:01:39.479> roots<00:01:39.690> are<00:01:39.870> black

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
is showing and since my roots are black

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.200 
is showing and since my roots are black
I<00:01:40.680> was<00:01:41.130> hoping<00:01:41.250> maybe<00:01:41.520> look<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:41.820> little<00:01:42.030> natural

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
I was hoping maybe look a little natural

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.450 
I was hoping maybe look a little natural
which<00:01:42.630> I<00:01:42.750> think<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.110> does<00:01:43.320> because<00:01:43.590> when<00:01:44.310> it's

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
which I think it does because when it's

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.920 
which I think it does because when it's
too<00:01:44.610> far<00:01:44.850> out<00:01:44.880> that's<00:01:45.300> when<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.540> bangs<00:01:45.750> are

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
too far out that's when the bangs are

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.240 
too far out that's when the bangs are
really<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.680> super<00:01:46.920> long<00:01:47.250> so<00:01:48.410> yeah<00:01:49.410> this<00:01:50.070> is

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
really really super long so yeah this is

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.090 
really really super long so yeah this is
it<00:01:50.600> I'm<00:01:51.600> gonna<00:01:51.780> play<00:01:52.050> with<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.470> some<00:01:52.500> more<00:01:52.710> like
