getting<00:00:17.070> into<00:00:17.369> it<00:00:17.400> and<00:00:17.640> don't<00:00:18.060> have<00:00:18.390> anyone<00:00:18.720> to

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
getting into it and don't have anyone to

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.990 
getting into it and don't have anyone to
ask<00:00:19.020> to<00:00:19.740> get<00:00:19.980> answers<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.490> your<00:00:20.580> questions

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
and then tell you what I ride myself as

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.049 
and then tell you what I ride myself as
just<00:00:32.160> sort<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.730> an<00:00:32.969> example<00:00:34.340> so<00:00:35.340> one<00:00:35.730> part<00:00:36.000> of

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
just sort of an example so one part of

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.479 
just sort of an example so one part of
the<00:00:36.120> time<00:00:36.329> first<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:37.020> all<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.320> wheels<00:00:37.530> my

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
the time first of all the wheels my

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.069 
the time first of all the wheels my
advice<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.000> you<00:00:39.500> bigger<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.739> better<00:00:42.079> having

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
advice to you bigger the better having

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.470 
advice to you bigger the better having
them<00:00:43.320> bigger<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:44.010> means<00:00:44.190> that<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.850> go<00:00:45.000> farther

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
them bigger it means that you go farther

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.040 
them bigger it means that you go farther
and<00:00:45.809> Ferster<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> 360<00:00:47.210> degree<00:00:48.210> rotation<00:00:48.660> of

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
and Ferster for a 360 degree rotation of

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:49.760 
and Ferster for a 360 degree rotation of
the<00:00:49.320> wheel

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
the wheel

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.290 
the wheel
meaning<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> bearing<00:00:50.520> doesn't<00:00:50.789> have<00:00:50.910> to<00:00:51.059> spin

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
meaning the bearing doesn't have to spin

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.389 
meaning the bearing doesn't have to spin
as<00:00:51.449> much<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.020> to<00:00:52.199> go<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.559> certain<00:00:53.070> distance

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
as much for you to go a certain distance

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.650 
as much for you to go a certain distance
also<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:55.140> harder<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.649> better<00:00:56.510> it<00:00:57.510> means

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
also the harder the better it means

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.569 
also the harder the better it means
there'd<00:00:58.020> be<00:00:58.170> less<00:00:58.440> friction<00:00:58.890> between<00:00:59.250> your

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
there'd be less friction between your

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.639 
there'd be less friction between your
wheel<00:00:59.820> and<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.300> ramp<00:01:00.510> meaning<00:01:01.379> you'll<00:01:01.530> go

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
wheel and the ramp meaning you'll go

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.640 
wheel and the ramp meaning you'll go
faster<00:01:02.420> it's<00:01:03.420> sort<00:01:03.690> of<00:01:03.750> like<00:01:03.930> pumping<00:01:04.409> up<00:01:04.530> a

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
faster it's sort of like pumping up a

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.520 
faster it's sort of like pumping up a
tire<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.220> car<00:01:05.460> or<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.790> bike<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.900> harder<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
tire in a car or a bike the harder the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.859 
tire in a car or a bike the harder the
better

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.410 

I<00:01:09.900> personally<00:01:10.500> ride<00:01:11.159> bones<00:01:11.549> they're<00:01:12.210> called

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
I personally ride bones they're called

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.160 
I personally ride bones they're called
bones<00:01:12.630> because<00:01:13.049> they're<00:01:13.350> light<00:01:14.030> SPF

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
bones because they're light SPF

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
here to here and I would recommend using

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.660 
here to here and I would recommend using
anywhere<00:01:35.939> between<00:01:36.119> 54<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.170> 62<00:01:37.950> millimetres

anywhere between 54 and 62 millimetres

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.600 
anywhere between 54 and 62 millimetres
although<00:01:39.420> 54<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.290> think<00:01:40.560> is<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.770> bit<00:01:40.950> small<00:01:41.430> you

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
although 54 I think is a bit small you

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.510 
although 54 I think is a bit small you
won't<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:41.939> enough<00:01:42.240> speed<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:43.250> 62<00:01:44.250> is<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.369> bit

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
won't get enough speed and 62 is a bit

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.889 
won't get enough speed and 62 is a bit
big<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:45.090> think<00:01:45.479> that<00:01:45.960> 58<00:01:46.500> is<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.950> perfect<00:01:47.369> size

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
big I think that 58 is the perfect size

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:51.350 
big I think that 58 is the perfect size
so<00:01:48.899> for<00:01:49.140> trucks<00:01:49.470> you<00:01:50.220> want<00:01:50.399> them<00:01:50.579> wide<00:01:50.790> for

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
so for trucks you want them wide for

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.810 
so for trucks you want them wide for
stability<00:01:52.009> you<00:01:53.009> want<00:01:53.159> them<00:01:53.310> probably<00:01:53.579> wider

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
stability you want them probably wider

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.560 
stability you want them probably wider

just<00:02:02.159> a<00:02:02.250> preference<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.509> do<00:02:03.689> want<00:02:03.899> them

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
just a preference but you do want them

to be flush with your deck so they're

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.770 
to be flush with your deck so they're
not<00:02:06.420> sticking<00:02:06.930> out<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.409> our<00:02:07.979> side<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.629> so<00:02:09.629> that

because my name is Jess and I thought
it'd<00:04:30.940> be<00:04:30.970> cool<00:04:31.240> to<00:04:31.270> be<00:04:31.630> Jess<00:04:32.140> who<00:04:32.350> rides

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
it'd be cool to be Jess who rides

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:39.110 
it'd be cool to be Jess who rides
dress-up<00:04:33.540> so<00:04:35.130> the<00:04:36.130> next<00:04:36.340> part<00:04:36.520> is<00:04:36.730> bearings

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.120 
dress-up so the next part is bearings

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.930 
dress-up so the next part is bearings
obviously<00:04:40.120> the<00:04:40.270> faster<00:04:40.510> the<00:04:40.840> better

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
obviously the faster the better

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.930 
obviously the faster the better
personally<00:04:42.940> I<00:04:43.000> ride<00:04:43.450> bones<00:04:44.160> swiss<00:04:45.160> ceramics

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
personally I ride bones swiss ceramics

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:49.830 
personally I ride bones swiss ceramics
which<00:04:46.780> are<00:04:46.930> precision<00:04:47.320> bearings<00:04:48.180> I<00:04:49.180> clean

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
which are precision bearings I clean

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.110 
which are precision bearings I clean
them<00:04:50.020> periodically<00:04:50.800> which<00:04:51.310> I<00:04:51.550> highly

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
them periodically which I highly

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.490 
them periodically which I highly
recommend<00:04:54.510> bones<00:04:55.510> bearings<00:04:56.020> are<00:04:56.200> the<00:04:56.350> only

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
recommend bones bearings are the only

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.870 
recommend bones bearings are the only

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:56.890 
you want the old-school look then you

00:05:56.890 --> 00:05:58.260 
you want the old-school look then you
should<00:05:57.070> get<00:05:57.220> them<00:05:57.340> but<00:05:57.550> personally<00:05:57.970> I<00:05:58.060> didn't

00:05:58.260 --> 00:05:58.270 
should get them but personally I didn't

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:00.300 
should get them but personally I didn't
use<00:05:58.390> them<00:05:58.570> because<00:05:58.660> I<00:05:59.110> don't<00:05:59.680> really<00:05:59.980> think<00:06:00.070> I

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
use them because I don't really think I

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.870 
use them because I don't really think I
need<00:06:00.490> them<00:06:01.260> for<00:06:02.260> risers<00:06:02.740> though<00:06:03.010> which<00:06:03.700> are

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
need them for risers though which are

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.520 
need them for risers though which are
the<00:06:04.030> plastic<00:06:04.479> things<00:06:04.690> you<00:06:04.870> put<00:06:05.080> between<00:06:05.260> your

trucks in the deck

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:10.320 
trucks in the deck
I<00:06:06.610> recommend<00:06:07.480> you<00:06:07.600> do<00:06:07.750> not<00:06:07.780> get<00:06:08.170> them<00:06:09.090> first<00:06:10.090> of

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:10.330 
I recommend you do not get them first of

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:12.330 
I recommend you do not get them first of
all<00:06:10.360> because<00:06:10.750> you<00:06:11.020> want<00:06:11.200> a<00:06:11.440> low<00:06:11.620> profile<00:06:12.190> you

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
all because you want a low profile you

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:15.330 
all because you want a low profile you
want<00:06:12.550> a<00:06:12.670> low<00:06:12.880> center<00:06:13.330> of<00:06:13.360> gravity<00:06:13.480> and<00:06:14.340> also

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
want a low center of gravity and also

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.550 
want a low center of gravity and also

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:21.820 
having your truck stick out more we

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:24.480 
having your truck stick out more we
could<00:06:22.030> potentially<00:06:22.300> make<00:06:22.930> you<00:06:23.770> hang<00:06:23.980> up<00:06:24.160> which

prevent wheel bite which is when your

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.540 
prevent wheel bite which is when your

wheel touches the deck stops the wheel

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.270 
wheel touches the deck stops the wheel
and<00:06:36.760> sends<00:06:37.030> you<00:06:37.090> flying<00:06:37.300> forward<00:06:38.040> so<00:06:39.040> that

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
and sends you flying forward so that

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:40.650 
and sends you flying forward so that
would<00:06:39.400> just<00:06:39.580> be<00:06:39.760> if<00:06:39.940> you<00:06:40.060> have<00:06:40.210> really<00:06:40.480> big

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:40.660 
would just be if you have really big

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.140 
would just be if you have really big
wheels<00:06:40.930> and<00:06:41.200> really<00:06:42.040> loose<00:06:42.250> trucks<00:06:42.580> you<00:06:42.970> would

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
wheels and really loose trucks you would

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:45.120 
wheels and really loose trucks you would
probably<00:06:43.750> want<00:06:43.780> risers<00:06:44.410> but<00:06:44.680> I<00:06:44.710> would<00:06:44.980> say
