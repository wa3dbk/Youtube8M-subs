00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.400
 I live in a very small village At the other end of the planet 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:54.672
 A settler in Alpha Centauri 5th - B Third moon on the left 

00:00:54.672 --> 00:01:11.820
 In the solitude of a rural doctor Without anyone to be able to talk about anything 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:34.120
 With two hundred souls in my charge With two hundred souls in my charge 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:57.250
 Every day I do my round for the rest of the houses 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:13.430
 Everyone is very kind to me But none is my friend 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:31.730
 In the solitude of a rural doctor Without anyone to be able to talk about anything 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:47.920
 With two hundred souls in my charge With two hundred souls in my charge 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:03:05.650
 And I dreamed that we were 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.140
 the two In a sea of ​​indigo swimming 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.730
 Among phosphorescent algae Oh Isabel, Isabel ...
