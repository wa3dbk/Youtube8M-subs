00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.750
 happening incredibly well where you want 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.610
 that are kids today 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.710
 I bring a video tutorial that I have 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.750
 been asking for some people and it's 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.369
 very easy and very simple and good because 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.289
 here I bring you how to make a 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.990
 screenshot on my computer 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.789
 very well the first thing they have to know 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.460
 is I know three ways to do this 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.810
 and I'm going to show you the three of you 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.429
 they will choose the one they like most 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.319
 first and the one that makes me much more 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.330
 easy is with this application that is 

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:36.240
 llama fs capture is an application 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.890
 Portable does not need to be installed 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.870
 I'm going to leave it down here in the description 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.610
 of the video the link for you 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.350
 they also lower it, it's going to be a 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.570
 point rar file give you right click 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.970
 extract here and you will have one 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.680
 folder like this one in the folder are going to 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.430
 find the application if you give double 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.410
 click and it is this capture fs they are going to give 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.940
 double click also here to the application 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.160
 and this little window will appear 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.469
 this little window has several options if 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.000
 you want to capture all the 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:07.100
 screen or also if you want to capture 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.530
 just the taskbar or some 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.720
 part of your screen to capture all 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.850
 the screen is going to click here 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.770
 this part and what was going to appear 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.810
 red streaks around like these and a 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.210
 The little hand is indicating that 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.369
 you want all the 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.970
 screen to capture the entire screen 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:31.340
 just click here where you want 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:35.000
 and they will appear a sound that is 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.659
 captured and this window we have 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.850
 Several options to save and print 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.009
 close and here save how we're going to 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.290
 give here in save as and we're going to 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:47.630
 put a name 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:50.960
 capture and we will choose the format that 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:52.370
 we want that it has been saved and 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.740
 we give in save save in the 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.310
 desktop and here they have the capture of 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.650
 screen 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.300
 I have two screens if we open the 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.030
 image then the two are shown this is 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.160
 a screen that I have and this is my 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.190
 screen that you are watching and you 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.869
 they capture the two other way to use 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:11.570
 this application that I like a lot 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:14.330
 is this way let's click 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.520
 here and we're going to select the part that 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.260
 we want it to capture the 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.570
 we select and it automatically goes to 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.950
 open this window and the same process 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:27.500
 save as some man and save and 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.270
 here we have what we want or what 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.160
 We wanted to capture from our 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.410
 screen very well the following way of 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.150
 do this is like for windows 8 I do not 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.290
 I have tried for another windows you 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.730
 they have another windows what can 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.860
 try and tell me if it works or not 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.540
 it works but we have windows 8 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.980
 we have an easier way to do 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.600
 screenshots 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.239
 let's see our keyboard and let's 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.180
 locate the start or start key or 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:53.510
 this key usually has a logo 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.980
 windows yes and once we've located 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.019
 this key we will also locate the 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:59.510
 another called so Important 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.609
 important since we have located the 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.790
 two on our keyboard let's do what 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:08.989
 next we're going to press 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:12.079
 the two keys at the same time and we see 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:13.879
 what it does like an on and off 

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:15.709
 the computer do not get scared is because 

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:18.109
 just take like who says the photo 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.760
 our screen as well 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:22.189
 we did this where this was saved 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.609
 Automatically saved automatically 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:27.549
 in the images folder and we created a 

00:03:25.609 --> 00:03:30.349
 folder that is called screenshot 

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:32.440
 we open it and here is our catch 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.960
 of screen 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.300
 easy not very simple for those who 

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.890
 they have windows 8 but we have windows 8 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.470
 I do not know if it works for others but 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:44.620
 can you tell me 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.820
 very well the following is simpler 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.120
 only that it will not be saved 

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:51.280
 automatically pressing key 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:53.830
 important that is the other that pressed 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:56.680
 when they pressed the start we're going to 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.690
 just press the important one and already 

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:01.300
 the screen was captured but it is not going to 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.300
 save automatically we can 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.250
 have at there a photo editor as 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.890
 the photoshop but in this case we open 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.100
 photoshop and we will save our 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:13.450
 image is as follows once 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:16.209
 that has opened photoshop 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.030
 we give you control n to open another 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:21.790
 file and we give in ok and we will 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.900
 look like this so this blank 

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.920
 we control and uve and it's stuck 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.110
 automatically our 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.230
 capture that we made of screen with 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:35.420
 only the interbank key good not 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:38.600
 we must forget about this is a tips 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:41.000
 very easy which made it easier what you 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.980
 it made it easier for me 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.290
 first because you already have the option of 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.910
 save the first and the second are the 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:49.010
 simpler but if you do not have windows 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.950
 8 you can try with the first one or with 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.080
 the third I send a big hug a 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:56.800
 huge kiss take care a lot until the 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.800
 next video
