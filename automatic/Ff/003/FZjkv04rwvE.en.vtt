and<00:00:43.980> then<00:00:44.789> obviously<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.360> unit<00:00:45.690> itself<00:00:46.110> so

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
and then obviously the unit itself so

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.740 
and then obviously the unit itself so
the<00:00:47.129> first<00:00:47.370> thing<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.610> do<00:00:47.760> with<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> unit<00:00:48.600> is

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
the first thing you do with the unit is

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.680 
the first thing you do with the unit is
in<00:00:48.960> back<00:00:49.820> you<00:00:50.820> want<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.030> make<00:00:51.180> sure<00:00:51.210> you<00:00:51.480> put

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
in back you want to make sure you put

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.010 
in back you want to make sure you put
your<00:00:51.870> battery<00:00:52.170> in<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.710> 9-volt<00:00:53.219> battery

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
your battery in it's a 9-volt battery

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.130 
your battery in it's a 9-volt battery
and<00:00:55.020> put<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.320> cap<00:00:55.530> back<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:57.030> knobs<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.719> top

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
and put the cap back on the knobs on top

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.279 
and put the cap back on the knobs on top
or<00:00:58.469> how<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.949> turn<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> 10<00:00:59.609> 7000<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.840> off

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
or how you turn the 10 7000 on and off

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.619 
or how you turn the 10 7000 on and off
so<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:01.949> want<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.250> make<00:01:02.399> sure<00:01:02.430> they're<00:01:03.239> both<00:01:03.449> in

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
so you want to make sure they're both in

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.509 
so you want to make sure they're both in
the<00:01:03.719> off<00:01:03.870> position<00:01:04.290> before<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.220> start

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
the off position before you start

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.969 
the off position before you start
setting<00:01:05.820> up<00:01:05.990> the<00:01:06.990> next<00:01:07.200> thing<00:01:07.409> you<00:01:07.470> do<00:01:07.619> is<00:01:07.740> take

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
setting up the next thing you do is take

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.560 
setting up the next thing you do is take
out<00:01:08.189> one<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:08.549> lead<00:01:08.790> wires<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.360> get

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
out one of your lead wires so you get

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.780 
out one of your lead wires so you get
you<00:01:09.780> get<00:01:09.900> two<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.140> these<00:01:10.350> so<00:01:11.040> one<00:01:11.310> lead<00:01:11.549> wire

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
you get two of these so one lead wire

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.899 
you get two of these so one lead wire
goes<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.600> two<00:01:13.140> electrodes<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.490> if<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.670> want<00:01:14.850> a

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
goes to two electrodes so if you want a

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.090 
goes to two electrodes so if you want a
two<00:01:15.210> electrode<00:01:15.659> setup<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.500> just<00:01:16.740> use<00:01:16.890> one

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
two electrode setup you just use one

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.219 
two electrode setup you just use one
lead<00:01:17.280> wire<00:01:17.490> if<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:18.299> want<00:01:18.479> for<00:01:18.810> electrode

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
lead wire if you want for electrode

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.010 
lead wire if you want for electrode
setup<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:20.189> use<00:01:20.400> two<00:01:20.670> lead<00:01:20.850> wires<00:01:21.090> today<00:01:21.900> I'm

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
setup you use two lead wires today I'm

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.570 
setup you use two lead wires today I'm
just<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.320> do<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> two<00:01:22.710> electrode<00:01:23.189> setup

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
just going to do a two electrode setup

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.399 
just going to do a two electrode setup
I'm<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.210> take<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.570> lead<00:01:24.720> wire<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.170> put

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
I'm going to take the lead wire and put

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.800 
I'm going to take the lead wire and put
it<00:01:25.500> right<00:01:25.680> on<00:01:25.890> top<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.400> insert<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.390> into<00:01:27.570> the

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
it right on top and insert it into the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.890 
it right on top and insert it into the
what<00:01:28.140> we<00:01:28.259> call<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.590> channel<00:01:29.479> the<00:01:30.479> next<00:01:30.780> thing

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
what we call the channel the next thing

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.370 
what we call the channel the next thing
I'm<00:01:30.960> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:32.390> I'm<00:01:33.390> going<00:01:33.450> to<00:01:33.930> insert

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
I'm going to do is I'm going to insert

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.600 
I'm going to do is I'm going to insert
the<00:01:35.189> red<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:35.970> black<00:01:36.150> tip<00:01:36.479> of<00:01:37.400> the<00:01:38.400> lead

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the red and the black tip of the lead

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.620 
the red and the black tip of the lead
wire<00:01:38.759> right<00:01:39.420> into<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.960> electrode<00:01:41.299> the<00:01:42.299> next

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
wire right into the electrode the next

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.609 
wire right into the electrode the next
thing<00:01:42.780> I'm<00:01:42.840> going<00:01:42.869> to<00:01:42.990> do<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.170> take<00:01:43.470> the

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
thing I'm going to do is take the

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.440 
thing I'm going to do is take the
electrode<00:01:44.040> off<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.490> plastic<00:01:44.939> backing<00:01:45.149> and

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
area use four electrodes and surround it

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.819 
area use four electrodes and surround it
if<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:53.970> small<00:01:54.299> area<00:01:54.329> use<00:01:55.079> two<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.649> try<00:01:55.770> to

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
if it's a small area use two and try to

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.560 
if it's a small area use two and try to
surround<00:01:56.040> it<00:01:56.340> so<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.909> today<00:01:57.149> I'm<00:01:57.299> just<00:01:57.420> gonna

surround it so the today I'm just gonna
use<00:01:57.810> these<00:01:58.020> two<00:01:58.229> and<00:01:59.509> gonna<00:02:00.509> say<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.810> pain<00:02:01.020> is

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
use these two and gonna say the pain is

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.510 
use these two and gonna say the pain is
right<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.590> middle<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.799> my<00:02:01.920> forearm<00:02:02.159> here

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
right in the middle of my forearm here

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.719 
right in the middle of my forearm here
now<00:02:03.509> that<00:02:03.689> my<00:02:03.810> electrodes<00:02:04.259> are<00:02:04.409> on<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.770> simply

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
now that my electrodes are on I simply

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.300 
now that my electrodes are on I simply
take<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.119> unit<00:02:06.420> and<00:02:06.630> the<00:02:07.590> knob<00:02:07.829> that's<00:02:08.129> by<00:02:08.280> the

take the unit and the knob that's by the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.240 
take the unit and the knob that's by the
the<00:02:09.270> channel<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.780> inserted<00:02:10.229> and<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.739> turn<00:02:11.069> that

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the channel I inserted and I turn that

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.860 
the channel I inserted and I turn that
up<00:02:11.430> until<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:12.480> strong<00:02:12.959> but
