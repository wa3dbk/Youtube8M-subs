to do is set the lawnmower engine on top
the<00:02:40.350> boat<00:02:40.530> motor<00:02:40.830> let's<00:02:41.160> see<00:02:41.280> if<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.430> can<00:02:41.550> give

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
the boat motor let's see if I can give

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:49.980 
the boat motor let's see if I can give
you<00:02:41.760> an<00:02:41.880> example<00:02:41.970> here

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:58.220 

let's<00:02:50.440> see<00:02:52.260> you<00:02:53.260> see<00:02:53.500> there<00:02:55.740> there<00:02:56.740> we<00:02:56.890> go

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
let's see you see there there we go

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:08.900 
let's see you see there there we go
it'll<00:02:59.230> look<00:02:59.380> something<00:02:59.680> like<00:02:59.980> this

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.880 

it'll<00:03:09.540> look<00:03:09.660> something<00:03:09.930> like<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.620> right

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
it'll look something like that right

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.670 
it'll look something like that right
there<00:03:11.390> with<00:03:12.390> the<00:03:12.510> boat<00:03:12.660> motor<00:03:12.930> or<00:03:13.320> with<00:03:13.530> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
lawnmower engine oil once that's all

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.820 
lawnmower engine oil once that's all
once<00:03:18.540> I've<00:03:18.720> run<00:03:21.050> extensions<00:03:22.050> up<00:03:22.410> here<00:03:22.680> I'm

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
once I've run extensions up here I'm

four<00:03:42.120> stroke<00:03:42.570> boat<00:03:43.200> engine<00:03:43.440> and<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.460> reason<00:03:44.760> I

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
four stroke boat engine and the reason I

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.090 
four stroke boat engine and the reason I
got<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.150> came<00:03:45.330> up<00:03:45.450> with<00:03:45.480> this<00:03:45.660> idea<00:03:45.840> is<00:03:46.740> because

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
got it came up with this idea is because

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.240 
got it came up with this idea is because
most<00:03:47.310> to<00:03:47.730> most<00:03:48.060> places<00:03:48.360> now<00:03:48.860> don't<00:03:49.860> laugh<00:03:50.010> two

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
most to most places now don't laugh two

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.930 
most to most places now don't laugh two
strokes<00:03:50.610> on<00:03:51.180> like<00:03:51.900> the<00:03:52.470> lakes<00:03:52.680> and<00:03:52.920> such<00:03:53.130> so<00:03:53.910> I

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
strokes on like the lakes and such so I

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.160 
strokes on like the lakes and such so I
decided<00:03:54.540> what<00:03:55.020> the<00:03:55.170> heck<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.590> cost<00:03:55.860> a<00:03:56.010> couple

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.170 
decided what the heck it cost a couple

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.540 
decided what the heck it cost a couple
couple<00:03:58.170> hundred<00:03:58.380> bucks<00:03:58.560> into<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.010> thousands

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
couple hundred bucks into the thousands

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:05.240 
couple hundred bucks into the thousands
to<00:04:00.000> get<00:04:00.750> four<00:04:01.410> or<00:04:01.440> four<00:04:02.370> stroke<00:04:03.350> motor<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:05.190> I'm

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
to get four or four stroke motor so I'm

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.010 
to get four or four stroke motor so I'm
taking<00:04:05.340> that<00:04:05.580> make<00:04:05.790> one<00:04:06.030> if<00:04:06.480> I<00:04:06.660> can<00:04:06.810> make<00:04:06.990> one

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
taking that make one if I can make one

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.140 
taking that make one if I can make one
you<00:04:07.950> know<00:04:08.100> and<00:04:08.460> with<00:04:09.450> it<00:04:09.570> being<00:04:09.750> that<00:04:10.020> easy
