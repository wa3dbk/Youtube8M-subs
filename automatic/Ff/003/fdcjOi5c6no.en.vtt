00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
fountains this should have been i think

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.160 
fountains this should have been i think
it<00:00:22.769> was<00:00:22.800> like<00:00:22.890> a<00:00:23.010> 100<00:00:23.460> shot<00:00:23.730> 200<00:00:24.390> gram<00:00:24.510> cake<00:00:24.840> but

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170

you<00:00:25.410> know<00:00:25.529> that<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:25.740> guess<00:00:25.890> they've<00:00:26.039> run<00:00:26.220> out

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250

and<00:00:26.640> they<00:00:26.730> kind<00:00:27.000> of<00:00:27.060> changed<00:00:27.750> it<00:00:27.810> around<00:00:27.930> a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
and they kind of changed it around a

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.679

and<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.830> think<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.100> still<00:01:38.280> show<00:01:38.580> this<00:01:38.700> was<00:01:38.880> it's

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
and I think I still show this was it's

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.910 
and I think I still show this was it's
called<00:01:39.150> desert<00:01:39.420> at<00:01:39.540> night<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.799> my

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
called desert at night and this is my

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.880 
called desert at night and this is my
pyro<00:01:41.159> predator<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.200> think<00:01:43.380> mega<00:01:43.560> banker

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
pyro predator and I think mega banker
