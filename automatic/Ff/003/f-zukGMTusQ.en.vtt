to<00:04:48.960> do<00:04:49.110> something<00:04:49.500> like<00:04:49.650> that<00:04:49.920> and<00:04:50.100> then<00:04:50.280> play

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
to do something like that and then play

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.610 
to do something like that and then play
on<00:04:50.640> the<00:04:50.790> Queen<00:04:51.000> start<00:04:51.300> like<00:04:51.930> it's<00:04:52.110> okay<00:04:52.380> though

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
it's probably better played this a

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:58.700 
it's probably better played this a
little<00:04:55.950> bit<00:04:56.600> here<00:04:57.600> there's<00:04:57.780> castles<00:04:58.050> it's

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
little bit here there's castles it's

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:00.560 
little bit here there's castles it's
probably<00:04:58.800> better<00:04:59.100> to<00:04:59.250> do<00:04:59.520> this<00:04:59.730> now<00:04:59.790> this<00:05:00.360> is

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
probably better to do this now this is

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.680 
probably better to do this now this is
this<00:05:00.720> is<00:05:00.840> in<00:05:00.960> fact<00:05:00.990> right<00:05:01.440> I<00:05:01.470> was<00:05:02.690> forgetting

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
this is in fact right I was forgetting

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.720 
this is in fact right I was forgetting
to<00:05:04.260> play<00:05:04.470> this<00:05:04.680> this<00:05:04.980> move<00:05:05.220> first<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.610> only

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:05.730 
to play this this move first and only

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.830 
to play this this move first and only
then<00:05:06.060> castle<00:05:06.650> or<00:05:07.700> away<00:05:08.700> Eddie<00:05:08.910> for<00:05:09.330> something

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
then castle or away Eddie for something

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:14.270 
then castle or away Eddie for something
like<00:05:09.990> that<00:05:10.170> yeah<00:05:11.160> in<00:05:11.460> the<00:05:11.610> game<00:05:12.860> here<00:05:13.860> black<00:05:14.130> is

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.280

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
ok but ok this blunders just the

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.960

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
file is opening up energy for to prevent

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.400 
file is opening up energy for to prevent
that<00:05:26.790> and<00:05:26.850> now<00:05:27.120> the<00:05:27.180> sea<00:05:27.510> fog<00:05:27.720> is<00:05:27.870> opening<00:05:28.320> up

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
so that my my extra exchange really can

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:34.400 
so that my my extra exchange really can
play<00:05:31.620> a<00:05:31.650> role<00:05:31.740> I<00:05:31.919> can<00:05:32.480> play<00:05:33.480> on<00:05:33.660> the<00:05:33.780> C<00:05:33.990> file<00:05:34.200> and

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
play a role I can play on the C file and

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.590

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:36.600 
then with enough pieces traded it's

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.460 
then with enough pieces traded it's
relatively<00:05:37.290> easy<00:05:37.410> within<00:05:37.950> an<00:05:38.100> endgame<00:05:38.400> or
