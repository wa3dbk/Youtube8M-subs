 spacing you can here past and 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.119
 it is a little hard to find 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:30.410
 but only a little persistence with 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.910
 the station can be there if you can here 50 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:36.270

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:40.860
 between about 55 up to 60 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:42.270
 here is the space I marked here and if 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.009
 say a lot here that they always 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.759

 Israel is a little further to the left 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.469
 jacques spent a bit more on the 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:08.989
 right and a little lower 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.789
 other than c2 is inhibited from passing 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.500
 televised television with five hours and can be 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.209
 that he's here to the left 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.930
 I do not agree with the saw is watching 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.930
 to the right 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:23.060
 so here not having pointed out our 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.640
 past and others and 2 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.610
 only it is the hardest part of the 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.819
 People are not difficult but they appear 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.200
 complicated work spinning a glass 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.230
 I said down there and show you 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.360
 how to find hispasat using a 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.489
 Village receiver will take your receiver 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.920
 of the outlet for 10 seconds then goes 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.920
 hold the control menu button 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.720
 is to hold it will start to blink and it will 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.260
 enter the menu your secret menu 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.110
 library but is no longer secret not 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:06.150
 if you put the number 82 

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:08.730
 it will not appear but it is 82 91 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.070
 You confirm that it will appear. 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:14.790
 a few - if pressed the written button 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.690
 for advanced numbers blue button 8 yours 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.370
 control 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:25.890
 it will enter that frequency that the 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:29.580
 c2 frequency do what i love my 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.800
 land but I put in space to 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.840
 so let's do the following is very 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.239
 you can find the past and the 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.030
 itself if you are going to put the 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:40.700
 number two and press the button 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:43.680
 left side that button to be 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:51.330
 search channels on the channel will 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:57.690
 put the number 11 972 ready underneath 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:01.650
 you put number 275 00 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.560
 Then you change to horizontal, you see. 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:09.329
 here he has already found the past 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:10.590
 here he was with 77 level and what 

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:14.060
 he thinks he's 66 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:17.519
 so here we find I'll pass 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.090
 for you to grow back 2 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.019
 it's very easy just put the frequency 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.960
 of c2 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:37.470
 she is 11 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:41.020
 11 129 below you put one at 29 890 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.000
 upright 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.509
 then he will not show up because I'm 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:53.680
 using the cable of the past that adds two 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:56.680
 ufpb courses to warm up long before 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.949

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.949
 source 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:12.520

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.530
