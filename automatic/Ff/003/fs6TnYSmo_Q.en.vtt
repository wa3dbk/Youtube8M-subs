00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
system that can do that and it will ban

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.680 
system that can do that and it will ban
anyone<00:00:50.430> that<00:00:50.789> gets<00:00:50.879> over<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.390> certain

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
anyone that gets over like a certain

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.779 
anyone that gets over like a certain
amount<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:51.899> money<00:00:52.050> or<00:00:52.230> RP<00:00:52.620> /<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.280> race<00:00:53.520> or

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
amount of money or RP / like race or

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.610 
amount of money or RP / like race or
missions<00:00:54.210> stuff<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.750> that<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.170> i'm

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
missions stuff like that and i'm

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.900 
missions stuff like that and i'm
guessing<00:00:55.949> they<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.219> actually<00:00:56.370> check<00:00:56.730> if

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
guessing they can actually check if

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.310 
guessing they can actually check if
you're<00:00:57.030> connected<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> modded<00:00:57.930> server<00:00:58.230> or

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
you're connected to a modded server or

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.080 
you're connected to a modded server or
not<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.129> that's<00:00:59.370> another<00:00:59.640> thing<00:00:59.850> you're<00:01:00.000> going

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
not so that's another thing you're going

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.090 
not so that's another thing you're going
to<00:01:00.180> have<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.359> watch<00:01:00.480> out<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:00.750> but<00:01:01.739> um<00:01:01.859> yeah

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
to have to watch out for but um yeah

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.860 
to have to watch out for but um yeah
this<00:01:02.250> could<00:01:02.430> have<00:01:02.579> been<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:02.760> decoy<00:01:03.300> Rockstar

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
this could have been a decoy Rockstar

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.270 
this could have been a decoy Rockstar
could<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.110> sent<00:01:04.320> this<00:01:04.409> DNS<00:01:04.769> code<00:01:05.010> out<00:01:05.129> to

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
could have sent this DNS code out to

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.550 
could have sent this DNS code out to
someone<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:06.000> tell<00:01:06.210> everyone<00:01:06.510> else<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.110> then

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
someone to tell everyone else and then

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.289 
someone to tell everyone else and then
everyone<00:01:07.950> connected<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.520> it<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> banned<00:01:09.210> a

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
everyone connected to it and banned a

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.280 
everyone connected to it and banned a
whole<00:01:09.420> bunch<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.630> people<00:01:09.689> they<00:01:10.020> could<00:01:10.200> have

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
whole bunch of people they could have

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.289 
whole bunch of people they could have
done<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.650> but<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:11.310> don't<00:01:11.729> know<00:01:11.820> if<00:01:11.850> Rockstar

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
done that but I don't know if Rockstar

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.000 
done that but I don't know if Rockstar
would<00:01:12.420> do<00:01:12.570> something<00:01:12.900> like<00:01:12.990> that<00:01:13.080> they<00:01:13.799> might

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
would do something like that they might

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
would do something like that they might
I've<00:01:14.189> never<00:01:14.340> seen<00:01:14.580> it<00:01:14.700> before<00:01:14.760> from<00:01:15.150> them<00:01:15.330> but

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
I've never seen it before from them but

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.050 
I've never seen it before from them but
you<00:01:16.380> never<00:01:16.560> know<00:01:16.710> they<00:01:16.950> are<00:01:17.100> rockstars<00:01:17.549> so

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
enter the DNS code at one point I went

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.090 
enter the DNS code at one point I went
online<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.540> like<00:01:31.409> well<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.680> tried<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.950> go

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
online and like well I tried to go

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.859 
online and like well I tried to go
online<00:01:32.250> and<00:01:32.640> my<00:01:32.790> game<00:01:33.030> froze<00:01:33.180> every<00:01:33.600> time<00:01:33.810> i

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
online and my game froze every time i

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.929 
online and my game froze every time i
tried<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.439> load<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.710> GTA<00:01:35.070> i<00:01:35.369> was<00:01:35.670> like<00:01:35.759> what<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
tried to load up GTA i was like what the

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.880 
tried to load up GTA i was like what the
hell<00:01:36.119> is<00:01:36.210> happening<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.900> yeah<00:01:37.710> when<00:01:37.860> I

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
hell is happening and yeah when I

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.859 
hell is happening and yeah when I
disconnected<00:01:38.490> from<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.759> DNS<00:01:39.090> code<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.750> would

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
disconnected from the DNS code it would

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.719 
disconnected from the DNS code it would
actually<00:01:39.960> let<00:01:40.229> me<00:01:40.350> load<00:01:40.500> up<00:01:40.530> online<00:01:40.799> again<00:01:41.220> so

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
actually let me load up online again so

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.100 
actually let me load up online again so
i'm<00:01:41.790> guessing<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.150> host<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.720> whoever<00:01:42.960> was

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
i'm guessing the host or whoever was

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.830 
i'm guessing the host or whoever was
hosting<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.920> server<00:01:44.490> i'm<00:01:44.880> actually<00:01:45.479> shut

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
hosting the server i'm actually shut

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.969 
hosting the server i'm actually shut
down<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.140> server<00:01:46.350> because<00:01:46.590> he<00:01:46.770> was<00:01:46.890> getting

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
down the server because he was getting

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.260 
down the server because he was getting
too<00:01:47.220> much<00:01:47.340> activity<00:01:47.549> on<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.149> or<00:01:48.240> something

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
too much activity on it or something

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.690 
too much activity on it or something
like<00:01:48.630> that<00:01:48.689> but<00:01:49.619> if<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.890> was<00:01:50.009> a<00:01:50.040> few<00:01:50.369> hours

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
like that but if it was a few hours

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.789 
like that but if it was a few hours
before<00:01:51.079> then<00:01:52.079> i<00:01:52.140> probably<00:01:52.320> would<00:01:52.560> have<00:01:52.649> went

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
before then i probably would have went

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.219 
before then i probably would have went
online<00:01:52.979> with<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.460> dns<00:01:53.880> code<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.479> i<00:01:54.930> probably

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
online with the dns code and i probably

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.350 
online with the dns code and i probably
have<00:01:55.500> been<00:01:55.649> been<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.460> I'm<00:01:56.610> lucky<00:01:56.880> that<00:01:57.060> I'm<00:01:57.180> not

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
have been been so I'm lucky that I'm not

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.149 
have been been so I'm lucky that I'm not
banned<00:01:57.600> on<00:01:57.750> my<00:01:57.840> third<00:01:58.049> account<00:01:58.350> or<00:01:58.920> I<00:01:58.950> would

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
banned on my third account or I would

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.010 
banned on my third account or I would
