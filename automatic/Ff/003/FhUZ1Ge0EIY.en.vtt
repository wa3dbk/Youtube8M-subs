00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.719
 Chapter forest not that even though 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.580
 more than half of the episode was seeing 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:15.250
 assholes that make dare trap between 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.380
 yes but it was more in reflection quality 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.230
 because the parasite mentions 100 s 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:22.180
 about altruism and also raises the 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.220
 things from a more logical point of view 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.890
 to say shit if you're going to throw 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.840
 save a friend of between 6 to 7 monkeys to 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.820
 unless you have a group of friends 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.160
 that go to give it or have a 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.620
 Right hand with voice from there, do not spin 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.450
 they are going to recharge now that you mentioned 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.280
 what about there tour does not yet follow 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:43.120
 bullying about the scandal 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:48.070
 sexual voice at least happened to be a panda 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:50.140
 to a charismatic right hand that 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.519
 reflection by the strongest and the 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.309
 shit with punches that receives the 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.870
 protagonist is a way to mature and 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.670
 be conditioned by the logic of 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.879
 parasite because it shows that in a 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.679
 occasion they focus and they get into a 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:05.530
 look where those particles look 

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:07.480
 cosmic relocates where obviously they 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.580
 they say that cana is super sensitive and can 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.510
 detect the parasite but seeing it by 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.310
 the personality side 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.020
 somehow active change more 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.970
 go ahead and if you are not going to think the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.970
 things in a colder way 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.000
 and remember what I said in the 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.740
 chapter 1 review do not analyze the 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.320
 images because they are going to fuck the 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.570
 little things later, good if it was the 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.729
 mother the herberger sprig was necessary 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.680
 that really were so graphic is 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.290
 say they put a scene where is 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.270
 the mother and they put parasite streaks and 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.479
 put in a black and white plane or 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.549
 that sons of bitches are worse every day 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.369
 and do not look at the opening of sao that 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:54.000
 they made a spoiler like that with Sudan there 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:58.310
 they are special not afraid not capture and of 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.310
 Oster is well known to steal 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.960
 at the beginning of the series he had 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.790
 mentioned that the parasite directly 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.200
 when he got into a part of the body 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.080
 and I could not control my head 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.390
 directly I could not control it so 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.459
 that good now it showed that after 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:17.440
 of the accident and must have 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.420
 what to do with the body has to do 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.640
 fast because it is either difficult or 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.190
 directly impossible to change 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.510
 directly the head of another body 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.519
 but there are also some very 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.010
 important and although they look like girls they are 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.319
 very important because he mentions about 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.630
 the compatibility problems with the 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.430
 body with this that it differs 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.069
 depending on the sex because when 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.680
 it changes the man has problem and it looks 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:44.650
 clearly that having a ball is 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.970
 makes it difficult now just like 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.190
 it was a man's and obligatorily 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.830
 had to change body you have to 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.870
 transfer to a woman's body the most 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.269
 how close it was that was just the 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.269
 athletic tim movie mother with 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.880
 Well, no 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:07.190
 I say it and I 'm going to repeat it is so 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.020
 natural the scene between shinichi and the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.090
 family because obviously it's pretty 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.160
 justified this time because the father 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:15.080
 call and tell your old lady is wrong there is a 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.480
 monster and directly you cut the 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.280
 called so with that in mind that you 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.930
 come the memories of the mother when 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.150
 he dropped boiling oil that I have 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:25.520
 a nightmare that the father does not return to 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.860
 call and let all that materialize in 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.050
 a real nightmare where the mother 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:32.750
 appears really in front of me and that 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.540
 is transformed into a parasite is scene 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.280
 directly destroyed it and entered into a 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.410
 state of shock and denial that 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.690
 completely clouded the head that is in 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.500
 this is great but they screwed it up with a 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.500
 stupid thing 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.460
 already the CEO and the 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:52.440
 sound director are skating on 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:54.120
 several little things that come dragging 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.710
 because you can not put me a scene in 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.360
 where is the real protagonist liked 

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:59.790
 in front of the mother who became 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.520
 in a parasite and that you pass music 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.560
 something dramatic tense to a totally 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.180
 accelerated and that you cut it dry and 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.090
 you come back to the same medium theme as 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:10.860
 we're pretty skating there in addition to 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.570
 what to see I do not know if it's being what 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:14.370
 descriptive enough but I'm going 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.380
 to repeat again so that you 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.510
 let me know, there is a scene from 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.830
 very important tension and to close it 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.420
 well you have to remove the ending for 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:23.430
 that there is no clash between the closure of the 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:27.140
 chapter and the song of the ending of the 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.140
 said to the fact that they did 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.400
 you can not do that to me the mother just 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.990
 dying I'm wrong and you close me the 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.330
 chapter to then start the ending 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:43.229
 that has a song reffer but what 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:45.000
 moqueros in the end the parasite is good 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.430
 the issue is that the staff does not finish 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.229
 finalize those details to separate the 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.419
 line entry say this series is 

00:04:49.229 --> 00:04:54.539
 good to this series is very good 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.280
 to staff but damn good with that people 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.289
 I hope you liked the video and 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:01.590
 If so, you already know about the favorite life 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.210
 comments subscribe be and this review is not 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:04.530
 is the one that was going to cover but fuck me 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.020
 he liked the chapter and he wanted them 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.300
 comment so I'll see if I finish 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:11.130
 write the other and finished recording 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.259
 because I have some little things that 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:16.560
 finish for this week and between this one and 

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:19.180
 the other table I occupy so with that people 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:22.560
 now I hope we see it 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:22.560
 until next time 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.510
 topic 2 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:47.530
 never fails shell
