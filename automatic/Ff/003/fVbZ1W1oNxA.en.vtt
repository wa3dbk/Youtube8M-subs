hard to see in there and one other

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:11.830 
hard to see in there and one other
adjustment<00:02:10.670> we<00:02:10.820> have<00:02:10.970> to<00:02:11.090> look<00:02:11.270> at<00:02:11.480> is<00:02:11.660> the

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
adjustment we have to look at is the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.500 
adjustment we have to look at is the
idle<00:02:12.170> mixture<00:02:12.350> screw<00:02:12.980> we<00:02:13.280> want<00:02:13.520> to<00:02:13.640> an<00:02:14.030> initial

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
idle mixture screw we want to an initial

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.190 
idle mixture screw we want to an initial
setting<00:02:14.990> and<00:02:16.450> on<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.900> particular

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
setting and on this particular

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.180 
setting and on this particular
carburetor<00:02:18.920> it<00:02:19.910> it<00:02:20.720> varies<00:02:21.290> depending<00:02:21.530> on<00:02:22.130> the

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
carburetor it it varies depending on the

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.590 
carburetor it it varies depending on the

carburetor number or the vehicle and

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.110 
carburetor number or the vehicle and
your<00:02:26.620> carburetor<00:02:27.620> kit<00:02:27.980> should<00:02:28.490> have<00:02:28.760> the

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
adjustment for that and now in this

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.110 
adjustment for that and now in this
particular<00:02:33.709> carburetor<00:02:34.490> I<00:02:34.610> have<00:02:34.910> no

particular carburetor I have no
carburetor<00:02:35.690> number<00:02:37.090> so<00:02:38.090> what<00:02:38.870> I'm<00:02:38.989> going<00:02:39.320> to

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.380 
carburetor number so what I'm going to

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.410 
carburetor number so what I'm going to
do<00:02:39.680> is<00:02:42.010> I'm<00:02:43.010> just<00:02:43.100> going<00:02:43.459> to<00:02:43.519> turn<00:02:43.760> it<00:02:43.970> in<00:02:44.090> and

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
do is I'm just going to turn it in and

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.040 
do is I'm just going to turn it in and
tell<00:02:44.630> if<00:02:45.550> gently<00:02:46.550> seats<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:50.720> I'm<00:02:50.870> going<00:02:51.019> to

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
tell if gently seats and I'm going to

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.300 
tell if gently seats and I'm going to
turn<00:02:51.290> out<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.890> turn<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.610> a<00:02:52.730> half<00:02:54.190> and<00:02:55.190> that

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
turn out a turn and a half and that

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.920 
turn out a turn and a half and that
should<00:02:55.580> be<00:02:55.730> enough<00:02:55.940> to<00:02:56.090> get<00:02:56.239> it<00:02:56.390> going<00:02:56.570> and

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
should be enough to get it going and

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.620 
should be enough to get it going and
once<00:02:57.739> it's<00:02:57.920> on<00:02:58.070> the<00:02:58.220> vehicle<00:02:58.580> then<00:02:58.760> we'll<00:02:58.940> do

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
once it's on the vehicle then we'll do

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.110 
once it's on the vehicle then we'll do
the<00:02:59.750> final<00:03:00.110> adjustment<00:03:00.620> on<00:03:00.709> that<00:03:00.739> now<00:03:01.730> some<00:03:02.090> of

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
the final adjustment on that now some of

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.699 
the final adjustment on that now some of
these<00:03:03.010> can<00:03:04.010> go<00:03:04.190> three<00:03:04.550> and<00:03:04.580> four<00:03:05.030> turns<00:03:05.709> so

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
these can go three and four turns so

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:18.570 
these can go three and four turns so
keep<00:03:07.580> that<00:03:07.820> in<00:03:07.880> mind
