00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.100 
think of or set up a private profile
that<00:02:21.730> doesn't<00:02:22.030> really<00:02:22.180> require<00:02:22.420> all<00:02:22.960> this

that doesn't really require all this
hassle<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.830> even<00:02:24.430> cooler<00:02:24.670> is<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.090> you'll

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
hassle and even cooler is that you'll

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.450 
hassle and even cooler is that you'll
notice<00:02:25.570> that<00:02:25.780> it<00:02:26.110> takes<00:02:26.380> no<00:02:26.740> time<00:02:26.980> to<00:02:27.220> switch

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460

notice that it takes no time to switch
between<00:02:27.670> one<00:02:28.180> profile<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:28.870> the<00:02:28.960> other<00:02:29.140> even
