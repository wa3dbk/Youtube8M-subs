00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.570
 machine machine I really like the body 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.570
 sedan 

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:28.250
 we have now considered the exterior of the car 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.250

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:43.829

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.110
 I can say about this car start with 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.460
 pros 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:54.379
 the chassis does not like for the Russian 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:56.940
 roads okay warm stove normal 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:59.390
 interior more or less large, this 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.989
 luxury grade 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.989
 different from basic she 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.520
 Velor Velor Seat upholstery fabric 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:15.810

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:17.840
 oh pleasant to the touch heated front 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.840
 the seats 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.010
 let's get everything to be seen 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.650
 also here are electric 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:48.210
 power windows front doors 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:54.590
 also available with driver's seat 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:58.590
 adjust the passenger window 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.979
 rear mechanical 5-speed 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.979
 Mechanics 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:10.610
 place for radio now it's not here 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.190
 . adjusting fans in three 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.260
 provisions 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.849
 I did not understand the on-board computer 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.930
 honest honestly they donâ€™t 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.750
 I use but how much refueling 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.660
 how much consumption is shorter there is something else 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.209
 garbage some time here and me 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.760
 machine guns constantly standing and everything also 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:33.739
 there is 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.060
 front fog lights here 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:38.680
 Th like the fog is very comfortable heating 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.890
 rear window 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:47.870
 the steering wheel is adjusted well, here I am in this 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:51.310
 it did not take him off this regime 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:54.790
 but he seems to go upstairs 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.790
 shorter 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.930
 so would still like to say adjustment 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.000
 headlamp angle 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:08.930
 participated lights I still minus one on 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.390
 Fifteen that headlights especially in the near 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.670
 not very dalnyak if you go on the highway 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.700
 not really if xenon only put a 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.700
 so standard goes 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:29.270
 not shorter but usually here in 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.730
 depending on the load of the machine 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.150
 adjustment I usually drove on the first 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.500
 mode 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:42.600
 so he will become so mirrors 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.570
 the seventh year they went such you see 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:47.960
 what color to reflective well 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:54.630
 nice nice to watch 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:56.540
 eyes don't get tired so what goes in 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.150
 luxury equipment 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:06.990
 Well, like all the onboard computers again 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:10.700
 I repeat heated front seats and here 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:16.310
 upholstery upholstery velor board computer 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:18.600
 cigarette lighter all sorts 

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:21.150
 for all the little things 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:22.890
 well then what is minus one more minus 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.630
 coasters no not provided 

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:30.350
 armrest cup holder uncomfortable 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.350
 sometimes 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:43.169
 the glass falls to me 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:46.050
 never let down so ok minus 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:52.430
 still plastic is very hard harsh 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:55.740
 soft only on the steering wheel it and hard if 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:05:01.789
 here is another little but the console itself 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:04.440
 here it is harsh also here still goes 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.069
 on some models most models 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:16.190
 the regiment and so here it is not 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:16.190
 Mostly with a shelf du 15 

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.440
 let's sit back 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:37.249
 not so comfortable behind you 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:42.219
 I see it so conveniently rejected the seat 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:49.909
 my height is 182 78 I rest my head on 

00:05:42.219 --> 00:05:52.749
 I see the ceiling and legs behind me 

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:56.509
 honestly not very comfortable to ride 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:06:02.379
 seats recline can be transported 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:09.789
 There skis or a sense of long logs and loads 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:14.960
 How to search for a mechanical rear window 

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:20.240
 lifts and falls not until the end he 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:24.759
 here is such a pen inherent to all 15 lengths 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.759
 and from this side 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:30.710
 So 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:42.320
 actually 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.320
 that's all
