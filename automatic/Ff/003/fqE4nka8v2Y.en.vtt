00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.040
 How nice that he is with us and now I am going to introduce you to a friend 

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.130
 she is nelio laneri like these 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.299
 also in nariÃ±o 

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.229
 and well, she brought us today, it is difficult to enter 

00:00:10.229 --> 00:00:11.450
 very pretty 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.329
 for all of you 

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:14.679
 it is common 

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:15.779
 her 

00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:17.519
 Villa Villa Viper 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:21.300
 that here I have this issue because they do not want to touch her 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.279
 this is a titan stressed per month 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.649
 It is a constrictor snake, that is, if it bites you, nothing happens to you 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:33.960
 it reaches up to seven meters although there have been cases of what is some of 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.080
 up to nine meters and weigh up to eight kilos 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.380
 they usually live from 20 to 30 years their coloration as you can see is color 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.290
 Brown 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.210
 this revival although it is very good swimmer 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.120
 and it adapts very good very well to captivity so if you require 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.749
 to have 

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:54.799
 in your house there is no problem is not a snake that the good cop 

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:57.630
 as all instinctively this 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.220
 I can attack 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.220
 besides that good not as they were told is dangerous 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:04.530
 but when it changes skin 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.159
 it is preferable not to manipulate it because sometimes they tend to be a little and avoidable 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.219
 She agreed that she changed her skin but they could not bring us her foot. 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:14.230
 remove 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:18.909
 i a good one is the only snake that incubates the eggs inside its belly 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.619
 feeling that already when she is 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.640
 is going to have his 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.990
 to your babies and coughs this water stands out the game does not come out 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.570
 I left mediately 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:31.620
 what is the snake 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.890
 good to distinguish the sexed of them from these animals is 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.890
 important good you can see it in the back 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.550
 What is andes? 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.680
 has two spurs and the male has more 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.340
 great that the inventar 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.730
 in terms of feeding when it continues to be good 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.980
 with this appointment you can eat rodents ede this 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.360
 small up farm bs 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.680
 this is because you can eat a dam ten times bigger than your head 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.510
 Well, you have to be careful when you try to have it at home and it's a bit 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.109
 and be bigger 

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:11.629
 so you have to be careful with the dogs because we are the cases where 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.119
 some this 

00:02:13.119 --> 00:02:16.169
 pythons some weddings has refused to eat even small dogs 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.639
 who also walks 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:25.209
 so this is a tiny specimen has about six months 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.599
 while this is called total were inferior small truths is what 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.970
 are 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.040
 in mice whistles that can find them in order 

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:37.159
 later in the veterinary and same to those in it for him to feed him 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.739
 and it's always important to maintain the quality that she likes a lot 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.409
 have water and also when it goes to 

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.829
 of skin she 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.479
 it needs and hydrated 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:51.259
 especially 

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:54.739
 in the middle that they must provide a trunk in their house so that they can 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.439
 let go of your skin 

00:02:56.439 --> 00:03:01.470
 they are also fed approximately every 15 days, although it may last 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:03.889
 two to three months 5- 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:08.669
 percent and how good your sales dads always this network alive since not 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:09.449
 is a 

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:11.219
 the scavenger 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:16.259
 On the other hand, the care we must take when adopting is not to break 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:17.710
 I told them with their habitat 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:21.990
 and such a place where I always lived, as I said a trunk 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:27.280
 with some branches and especially that the fish tank where they have it is mtb time 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.869
 be a thick glass 

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:32.169
 for your good work they start to grow obviously they have a very body 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.739
 strong and can break 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:36.979
 and where the security lid 

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:39.439
 as its name says it with a lot of security for what 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:43.039
 you can not escape it, so you can not scare 

00:03:43.039 --> 00:03:46.119
 to neighbors shortly after losing asu 

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:48.129
 to your pet 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:49.799
 i brown 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:54.360
 afterwards it is important this especially the boys that that if well at home this 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:55.309
 kind of pets 

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:59.529
 that when they commented there is no reason to manipulate them because 

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:04.959
 they can recourse to be food then whenever they are giving their their 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.650
 time for saying she manabita the trainerilla is very tranquilita 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.849
 Perez that up to three days he ate 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.809
 so that's why she's very quiet 

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:18.389
 in four points very important is that it is already winter since November 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.740
 I good low your metabolism so you usually stay in one place 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:27.449
 which are in your tank are usually quiet in one place almost not 

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.449
 move 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.090
 It lasts approximately until the month of January so you do not get scared if 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:36.879
 she does she finds herself very 

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:39.699
 very quiet and does not want this or eat 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.740
 when he has also taken out he can not be reached either 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.879
 to be the case that they do not like it 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:49.090
 maybe with him because they are just adapting to the view 

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.189
 you do not worry dl your time of the spaces so that she 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:54.100
 All society 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.100
 being here is going to eat or there is no problem that yes 

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:01.900
 we do not get to eat, that's not a very important thing, you're not going to die 

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:03.059
 true hunger in him 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:06.199
 and well we hope you have some status today 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:09.379
 our little pet that we bring you 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:13.620
 here my colleagues do not want to touch it but as you can see it is a 

00:05:13.619 --> 00:05:14.689
 little animal 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:17.689
 that will not be anything 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:29.469
 effective hawk-eye is commenting rule that when they kelman when they already 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:32.469
 they look 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.039
 that act that the dgt the tail bends up when they come to attack but 

00:05:42.039 --> 00:05:45.000
 in fact this is a little animal is that usually do not attack 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.250
 not even bite for any circumstance that is irritable and 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:54.260
 nothing happens simply by the way one just having is the Basque bbk bank that 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:57.850
 ended up missing only they are hospitalized and we thank God 

00:05:57.850 --> 00:06:01.119
 for being here I gave myself for having brought us 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:03.240
 and psoe 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.330
 no no thanks to kiki we hope to attract facts she will bring us 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:11.949
 a bet to stay with nothing to contribute to society but have added 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:13.419
 also to the downside 

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:17.789
 and good thing is that couples now we go now something else
