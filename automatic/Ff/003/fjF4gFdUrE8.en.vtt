right<00:00:19.320> into<00:00:19.560> the<00:00:19.710> tutorial<00:00:20.160> now<00:00:20.279> but<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.520> would

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
right into the tutorial now but I would

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.029 
right into the tutorial now but I would
advise<00:00:21.150> against<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:22.020> will<00:00:22.289> be<00:00:22.350> just<00:00:22.710> a<00:00:22.890> few

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
advise against it it will be just a few

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.009 
advise against it it will be just a few
minutes<00:00:23.279> to<00:00:23.519> look<00:00:23.550> at<00:00:23.760> this<00:00:23.939> video<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.480> then

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
minutes to look at this video and then

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.320 
minutes to look at this video and then
it's<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:26.070> doesn't<00:00:26.369> even<00:00:26.490> matter<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:27.090> doesn't

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
it's it doesn't even matter it doesn't

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.330 
it's it doesn't even matter it doesn't
make<00:00:27.480> any<00:00:27.539> sense<00:00:27.810> if<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.109> go<00:00:28.260> look<00:00:28.439> at<00:00:28.949> the

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
make any sense if you go look at the

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.859 
make any sense if you go look at the
explanation<00:00:29.880> and<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.060> don't<00:00:30.269> even<00:00:30.449> know<00:00:30.720> what

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
explanation and you don't even know what

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.770 
explanation and you don't even know what
the<00:00:31.019> trick<00:00:31.289> is<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.040> once<00:00:32.520> this<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.030> then<00:00:33.210> go

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
the trick is so once this and then go

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.810 
the trick is so once this and then go
and<00:00:34.020> dive<00:00:34.410> right<00:00:34.649> into<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.070> tutorial<00:00:35.610> it's<00:00:35.730> a

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
and dive right into the tutorial it's a

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.420 
and dive right into the tutorial it's a
good<00:00:35.969> trick<00:00:36.239> but<00:00:36.899> let's<00:00:37.140> first<00:00:37.530> let's<00:00:38.280> get

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
good trick but let's first let's get

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.150 
good trick but let's first let's get
started<00:00:38.820> talking<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.930> spectator<00:00:40.469> I<00:00:40.770> would

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
started talking the spectator I would

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.330 
started talking the spectator I would
ask<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.730> take<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.239> neck<00:00:42.710> take<00:00:43.710> any<00:00:43.980> number<00:00:44.309> of

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
ask to take the neck take any number of

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.819 
ask to take the neck take any number of
cards<00:00:44.840> shuffled<00:00:46.610> look<00:00:47.610> at<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.820> top<00:00:48.000> card<00:00:48.300> now

00:00:48.819 --> 00:00:48.829 
cards shuffled look at the top card now

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
cards shuffled look at the top card now
because<00:00:49.829> I<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.340> see<00:00:50.550> the<00:00:50.730> screen<00:00:50.969> I<00:00:51.360> can<00:00:51.809> see

the<00:01:20.580> spectator<00:01:21.000> drop<00:01:21.299> some<00:01:21.540> cards<00:01:21.840> on<00:01:21.960> top<00:01:22.110> of

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
the spectator drop some cards on top of

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.899 
the spectator drop some cards on top of
that<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.740> maybe<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.240> got<00:01:25.130> now<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.640> i

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
that and maybe if you got now that i

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.789 
that and maybe if you got now that i
think<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.750> cost<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.290> first<00:01:28.590> time<00:01:28.740> i

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
think the cost is the first time i

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.480 
think the cost is the first time i
thought<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.310> cards<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:31.070> i<00:01:32.070> would<00:01:32.250> say

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
thought the cards and i would say

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.910 
thought the cards and i would say
something<00:01:32.729> like<00:01:32.939> you<00:01:33.540> see<00:01:34.170> all<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.530> different

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
something like you see all the different

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.609 
something like you see all the different
cars<00:01:35.490> here<00:01:35.729> there<00:01:36.509> is<00:01:36.630> no<00:01:36.659> way<00:01:37.020> anybody<00:01:37.290> can

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
cars here there is no way anybody can

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.490 
cars here there is no way anybody can
know<00:01:37.799> what<00:01:38.340> the<00:01:38.520> god<00:01:38.700> is<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.060> i<00:01:39.150> try<00:01:39.689> if<00:01:40.350> I

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
know what the god is but i try if I

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.109 
know what the god is but i try if I
spread<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.070> cost<00:01:41.220> like<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.670> i<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:41.970> actually

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
spread the cost like this i can actually

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.960 
spread the cost like this i can actually
sense<00:01:43.430> your<00:01:44.430> God<00:01:44.700> oh<00:01:45.079> I<00:01:46.579> think<00:01:47.579> there<00:01:47.850> is<00:01:47.939> a

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
sense your God oh I think there is a

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.090 
sense your God oh I think there is a
problem<00:01:48.090> because<00:01:48.720> there<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.259> too<00:01:49.470> many<00:01:49.619> cards

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
problem because there is too many cards

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.649 
problem because there is too many cards
I'm<00:01:50.460> going<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.759> actually<00:01:50.880> do<00:01:51.210> them<00:01:51.360> into

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
I'm going to actually do them into

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.899 
I'm going to actually do them into
packets<00:01:52.049> like<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.470> sometimes<00:01:53.340> this<00:01:53.700> happens

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
packets like this sometimes this happens

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.510 
packets like this sometimes this happens
my<00:01:54.299> power<00:01:54.570> although<00:01:55.320> my<00:01:55.590> might<00:01:56.040> seem<00:01:56.280> like

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
my power although my might seem like

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.109 
my power although my might seem like
that<00:01:56.790> were<00:01:57.540> super<00:01:58.049> power<00:01:58.229> ever<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.939> in<00:01:59.939> fact

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
that were super power ever and in fact

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.660 
that were super power ever and in fact
it<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.540> buff

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
it is buff

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.710 
it is buff
sometimes<00:02:03.670> if<00:02:03.850> you<00:02:03.940> have<00:02:04.060> too<00:02:04.210> many<00:02:04.360> cards

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
sometimes if you have too many cards

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.980 
sometimes if you have too many cards
it's<00:02:04.840> hard<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.290> select<00:02:05.890> that<00:02:06.010> all<00:02:06.750> since<00:02:07.750> the

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:07.990 
it's hard to select that all since the

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.340 
it's hard to select that all since the
chosen<00:02:08.380> cards<00:02:08.770> okay<00:02:09.899> sometimes<00:02:10.899> it's<00:02:11.110> hard

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
chosen cards okay sometimes it's hard

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:14.070 
chosen cards okay sometimes it's hard
but<00:02:11.709> with<00:02:12.310> for<00:02:12.940> example<00:02:13.030> this<00:02:13.390> amount<00:02:13.720> of<00:02:13.870> cars

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
but with for example this amount of cars

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.530 
but with for example this amount of cars
it<00:02:14.230> shouldn't<00:02:14.560> be<00:02:14.709> very<00:02:14.950> hard<00:02:15.160> so<00:02:15.490> just<00:02:18.540> in

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
it shouldn't be very hard so just in

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.750 
it shouldn't be very hard so just in
fact<00:02:19.810> I<00:02:19.989> do<00:02:20.050> send<00:02:20.470> something<00:02:20.950> but<00:02:21.130> I<00:02:21.280> I'm<00:02:21.550> not

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
fact I do send something but I I'm not

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.490 
fact I do send something but I I'm not
quite<00:02:22.060> certain<00:02:22.270> where<00:02:22.630> it<00:02:22.780> is<00:02:22.930> on<00:02:23.110> going<00:02:23.410> to

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
quite certain where it is on going to

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.160 
quite certain where it is on going to
again<00:02:24.069> once<00:02:24.400> every<00:02:25.300> other<00:02:25.330> card<00:02:25.810> goes<00:02:25.989> up

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
again once every other card goes up

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.430 
again once every other card goes up
every<00:02:26.530> other<00:02:26.560> card<00:02:26.950> goes<00:02:27.190> down<00:02:27.459> you<00:02:27.700> see<00:02:28.440> so

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
every other card goes down you see so

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.350 
every other card goes down you see so
we're<00:02:29.890> going<00:02:30.069> to<00:02:30.190> eliminate<00:02:30.700> some<00:02:30.910> more<00:02:31.120> parts

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
we're going to eliminate some more parts

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.170 
we're going to eliminate some more parts
just<00:02:31.750> like<00:02:32.080> that<00:02:32.350> these<00:02:32.709> cards<00:02:33.100> go<00:02:33.310> away<00:02:33.760> now

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
just like that these cards go away now

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.509 
just like that these cards go away now
it's<00:02:34.450> easy<00:02:34.720> only<00:02:35.200> after<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.530> cards<00:02:35.920> just<00:02:36.160> I

00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 
it's easy only after you cards just I

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:39.350 
it's easy only after you cards just I
think<00:02:37.120> it's<00:02:37.420> my<00:02:37.600> ring<00:02:37.870> my<00:02:38.110> ring<00:02:38.140> it's<00:02:38.620> kind<00:02:38.860> of

think it's my ring my ring it's kind of

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.820 
think it's my ring my ring it's kind of
kind<00:02:40.360> of<00:02:40.510> like<00:02:40.660> in<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.930> metal<00:02:41.230> detectors

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
kind of like in a metal detectors

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.860 
kind of like in a metal detectors
something<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.850> can't<00:02:43.090> detect<00:02:43.600> it's

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
something you can't detect it's

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.979 
something you can't detect it's

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
disrupting know I still nothing it's not

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.560 
disrupting know I still nothing it's not

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
don't even know if that was the

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.660 
don't even know if that was the
corrector<00:03:13.450> God<00:03:13.720> but<00:03:14.440> I<00:03:14.620> can<00:03:14.890> be<00:03:15.310> absolutely

corrector God but I can be absolutely
certain<00:03:15.910> at<00:03:16.239> least<00:03:16.510> because<00:03:16.720> this<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:18.030> trick

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
certain at least because this the trick

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.090 
certain at least because this the trick
should<00:03:19.239> always<00:03:19.570> work<00:03:19.780> did<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.560> almost<00:03:20.920> say

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100 
should always work did I almost say

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:27.390 
should always work did I almost say
something<00:03:21.489> else<00:03:21.670> ok<00:03:22.360> but<00:03:22.600> yes<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:26.220> that's<00:03:27.220> the

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
something else ok but yes so that's the
