00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:10.700
 just released the CD down to sound 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:16.980
 Tell people who is rolling in Achille and 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:20.310
 Welcome to another video 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.070
 releases the cold of 4 and without taking a show 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.010
 of new maps in galley asked maps 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.529
 that the dlc second assault is the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.650
 maps of the beautiful end of three remasters 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.230
 to get the end of four and galera 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.960
 the maps are really cool I confess to 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:41.219
 you that this interactivity of the scenario 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.489
 and before did not cool this is okay 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.379
 operation firestorm map it has 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.289
 some really cool situations that are 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.000
 that tower that ends up falling and has 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.579
 some situations also have a part 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.550
 plumbing as you can. 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:59.989
 see that the arrival of oil a thing 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.850
 So, this pipe is gone. 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.070
 bursting ends up suffering damage in the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.439
 It happens that you play and he 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.510
 begins to release flaming rockets from 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.430
 fire as you are seeing pass through 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.430
 there you begin to suffer damages 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.960
 So it 's a really cool situation, I 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.930
 I confess to you that of all 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.520
 remastered maps of the son turkey is 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.189
 best of three 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.090
 the operation firestorm is what I least 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.850
 liked it 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.920
 not that I do not like the map what I 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.500
 I mean the map is legal the 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.990
 map is very nice it is nice of you 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.570
 play as was the number was 3 however 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.720
 this was the one that had the least improvements in 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.040
 visual part ended up improving is nice 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.020
 it was better just 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.350
 adding these little details that are 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:49.470
 that ndash falling during the match 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.320
 ah and if that part of the gas pipeline 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.840
 or finally explode oil 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.119
 starts to catch fire is at least this 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.060
 I do not remember having the son of three in the 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.369
 so that's why I'm talking 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.400
 but it's a few things that have ended 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.040
 improving on match 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.800
 The game continues to kill is almost the same 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.600
 almost no improvement 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.580
 this one unlike the map 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.260
 the average operation I brought you 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.480
 there was more for you to view the map 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.220
 This is not a game play. 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.920
 cool I got to play was 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.870
 playing the miner with my friend cricket 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.630
 I do not remember if I had any friends or 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.920
 but at first it was bleak and people 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.870
 I was playing with a few notes 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.520
 matches went very well 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.350
 I even played some nice games. 

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.610
 also in the mann gulf 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.850
 Too bad I could not get any 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:39.550
 legal departure in the case although 2014 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.680
 This is the most beautiful map for me. 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:44.080
 lc second assault I want to win from 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.490
 bring a video with you but I confess 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.380
 that every time I get there I always 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:50.200
 It was very bad and only once that I 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.790
 played well on this map was where I did not 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.180
 I recorded the gameplay was playing 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.430
 got to the face of almost 40 pounds 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.170
 were comcast largey or something 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.850
 in that sense on the lip 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.590
 It was a very nice match that I 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.790
 had not she also not recording for 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.880
 bring you guys 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:08.620
 but finally taking away the good part of bed 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.709
 sentence because you make a 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.900
 criticism in relation to the beautiful the field is 4 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.390
 of xbox the year in relation to the modality 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.519
 I dominated chan num when the game was 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.230
 released by this type of supports 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.390
 32 players 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.459
 only I do not know what happened in the 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.730
 midway is had some 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:30.730
 such updates in the game and the servers 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.430
 this mode is just to have a 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.850
 decrease in the amount of the prisoner they 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.150
 half cut there was a forced and 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.459
 32 players has fallen to 20 players ie 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:44.709
 evil is too great for the few people 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.220
 face is not cool mexican player xbox o 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.620
 year 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.420
 the modality is cool is one of the 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.820
 more legal modalities of the game I 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:54.580
 particularly much like domenech 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.380
 number 24 because you do not have to strike 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:58.330
 equal to the series that she makes then leaves 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.460
 The more we play on the gun and we have to 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.250
 stay behind catch the flag 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:05.260
 so this is cool with maps 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:09.010
 That's enough for you. 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:10.750
 playing against ten opponents is not 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.790
 cool guy you run often do not 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:14.860
 finds no one on this map 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.360
 fish sometimes have to firestorm 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:18.640
 run much from one side to the other 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.100
 so I can find the 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:23.530
 opponents in this match took a little 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:26.050
 Luckily, not a bit of luck. 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:28.420
 So I ended up playing against 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.740
 some snipers even the guy who 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.350
 I was wearing a lot of jokes he always 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.240
 tries to unify these constructions in the 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:38.230
 so this ended up leaving the game a 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.610
 bit annoying but it was cool for 

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:41.050
 have a hard time to us 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.650
 always had to keep going after the 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.690
 faces 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.190
 only he did not have much difficulty in 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.930
 capture the goal since they do not 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.120
 they were not there for the purpose 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.150
 simply I wanted to stay there deslife 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.160
 on top of the firing buildings of today 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.350
 and with that we were underneath and 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.140
 capturing stage mick dominating the 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:01.930
 The match was not at all difficult either. 

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:05.440
 winning is another thing I wanted 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:07.360
 talking to you is about the connection 

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.940
 of the game for those still wearing it is in 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:12.640
 doubt to buy 10 was 4 both the 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.620
 xbox the year while the ps4 i'm going to speak 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:15.970
 of ps4 for more that has not played more 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:18.100
 I do not think it should be very 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:20.710
 different is no server 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.000
 This is the only bad part. 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:24.700
 the game is not 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.730
 the graphic quality of the game is fine 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.040
 Nice, this game is on the pc and I can 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:32.260
 confirm to you that the quality 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:35.660
 graphic is very good I say that 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:38.930
 multiplayer is between the middle of the game 

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.330
 and the campaign mode is between a 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.800
 a ray even other than the mode 

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.260
 campaign of the game is much more beautiful was 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:46.850
 multiplayer but the graph of the 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:48.800
 great is also interesting to have 

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:51.380
 modes with 64 players 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.750
 only the tdm and the domain also that the 

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.760
 user should be easy and 

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.010
 This ends up leaving the game a little 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.860
 boring to understand and until it goes because 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:03.260
 the maps are smaller and 20 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:06.110
 Firefighters end up getting pretty cool but 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.030
 were 32 or fewer 32 prisoners in all 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.560
 and it would be very legal. 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:11.450
 So the question is always four 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.490
 bars for you to play if you take 

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:15.560
 some pretty good guys you always will 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.290
 have the disadvantage but still you 

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.970
 Can you play, can you have fun? 

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:23.090
 always know you 're legging then 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.040
 that they are a little more cautious and 

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:26.960
 you can still kill and 

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:28.790
 Can have fun in the game. 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.620
 unlike other games that you 

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.780
 is with the maximum connection know to 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.760
 connection is super good you shoot not 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:36.620
 can kill anyone 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:38.540
 the gameplay galley is almost here 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:41.300
 end hope you've enjoyed there 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:43.040
 these clips that I've separated for you 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:45.320
 It was not one bites of galaxies is not 

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:47.810
 But I think it's going to be fun. 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:49.610
 What made you entertain well? 

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.140
 Calm down, so I know, by the way. 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.340
