 we are approximately 4 years old 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.150

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.150
 we have grown as much as people like 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:30.649
 musicians as singers like 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.140

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.670
 we are not famous but good 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.140

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.330
 people like music us 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.140
 I hope you support us who support us 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.140
 to all of us 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.040
 plus 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.870
 I'm with the guys since I just 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:32.640
 get off the stage but excellent show 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.930
 first of all I would like it to be 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.359
 present 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.510
 good if we tell him to play guitar and 

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:41.800
 contrary voices that are required and I am 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.110
 the guitarist and vocalist 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.930
 I am nobody and played bass and I like it 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.520
 make noise I'm going to see and touched the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.390
 keyboard and dye 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:55.850
 tell me a little about your musical project 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:59.610
 as an excuse as how I eat 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:02.130
 conceptualize the sound of noise 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.820
 we like us 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.760
 like to unite all musical styles and 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.190
 make a salad with that and play with 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:14.380
 that and create our own clear sound 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.870
 we have influence of many bands but 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.550
 We try not always to limit ourselves to the 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.910
 time to create music in a genre 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:27.310
 specific also note that you have a 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:31.140
 visual and interesting proposal of the 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.140
 visual proposal as I do not expect 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.490
 the visual supports the videos too 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.320
 very well 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:43.090

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.460

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:51.250
 artistic production well eclectic all 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.740
 everything is very dÃ­az and diego there is forgiveness already 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.070
 we do it all ourselves 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.070
 absolutely everything 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.549

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.020

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.070
 the night 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.580
