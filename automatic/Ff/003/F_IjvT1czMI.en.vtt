00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.330
 or if 

00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:08.370
 well let's do the assembly of a 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.370
 banner holder of two extenders 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.719
 The first thing we are going to do then is 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.719
 finish 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.960
 two 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.160
 4 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.880
 and it's the biggest 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.890
 with these two parantes in the part 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.829
 back that will be the ones that are going to 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.579
 to contain the other 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:41.579
 I have already counted 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.210
 yes 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.210
 so 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.130
 and how we get it out yes 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.890
 the part that is 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.890
 We are going to stop harassing you 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.280
 and let's have the last two pieces 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.030
 what are the little ones to be modern 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:18.600
 well the first thing we do then is 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.190
 place the small pieces taking in 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.500
 account 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.340
 the shape of the pipe that is going to go 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:30.329
 forward of the two 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.329
 and so then only turns 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.260
 for the background 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.260
 and I put this 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:43.640
 and once those two are in place 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:48.220
 pieces directly hooked them in the 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:48.220
 hole of the lower plane 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.090
 and I place 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.090
 and it looked good 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.000
 we already have the base for the two pipes 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.130
 the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.220
 later taking into account the notch 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.050
 which is at the top is 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.880
 notch is not on the bottom of the 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:17.330
 change yes 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.560
 then we are digging up 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.560
 and we put it there 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:28.879
 and we put this with the notch up 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.879
 Oh 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.320
 then Ã¡lvaro what is last 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.000
 and the curvature rule 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.610
 this is going to be touch here 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.190
 there he made a stop 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.820
 and there too 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.270
 and released is ready to lift 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:56.049
 then the canvas 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:59.500
 now I only hold for what 

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:59.500
 it can happen 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.750
 I raise 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.329
 and having with a brother 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.790
 the structure with the other I'm going to 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.790
 develop 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.020
 you if you put it together a person can 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.800
 blushing and the allies 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:21.800
 others 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.230
 and there is what I have to think 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:30.569
 to do is to achieve tension I look for the 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:33.599
 hole that is in the upper spout 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:38.870
 which is the one that I have to find with the 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:41.480
 tip then tip the tip or force 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.920
 and there he presented 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.480
 let's go to the other side 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.230
 so 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.230
 unemployment 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:58.870
 tilted again the dawn 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.870
 as a center yes I need 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:05.510
 and the spouses rose up 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:16.170
 arrives 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.790
 we are then totally 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.959
 transportable and carry to the side 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.229
 what 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.229
 yes
