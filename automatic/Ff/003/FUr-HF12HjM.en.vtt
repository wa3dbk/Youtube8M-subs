variations<00:01:52.320> in<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> fact<00:01:52.710> that<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.820> windows

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
variations in the fact that the windows

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.780 
variations in the fact that the windows
on<00:01:54.329> this<00:01:54.450> one<00:01:54.659> are<00:01:54.869> clear<00:01:55.200> plastic<00:01:55.470> and<00:01:55.829> the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
on this one are clear plastic and the

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.780 
on this one are clear plastic and the
windows<00:01:57.090> on<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.509> one<00:01:57.719> or<00:01:57.960> red<00:01:58.380> plastic<00:01:59.100> there

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
windows on this one or red plastic there

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.190 
windows on this one or red plastic there
were<00:01:59.850> actually<00:02:00.210> another<00:02:00.570> few<00:02:00.810> variations

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
were actually another few variations

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.499 
were actually another few variations
where<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.579> plastic<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.030> different<00:02:03.360> color

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
where the plastic is different color

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.270 
where the plastic is different color

still so if you want to collect the
whole<00:02:05.399> set<00:02:05.460> they<00:02:05.729> were<00:02:05.790> actually<00:02:06.060> quite<00:02:06.210> a<00:02:06.329> few

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
whole set they were actually quite a few

that you can sort of look out for this

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:11.470 
that you can sort of look out for this
toy<00:02:09.239> was<00:02:09.360> never<00:02:09.690> released<00:02:10.110> in<00:02:10.259> white<00:02:10.470> dinky

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
toy was never released in white dinky

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.820 
toy was never released in white dinky
sort<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.540> notice<00:02:12.810> it's<00:02:12.930> saying<00:02:13.200> that

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
sort of notice it's saying that

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.050 
sort of notice it's saying that
they<00:02:14.040> didn't<00:02:14.280> think<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.460> children<00:02:14.910> would

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
they didn't think that children would

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.840 
they didn't think that children would
like<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.480> completely<00:02:16.110> white<00:02:16.320> toy<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.010> if<00:02:17.700> you

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
like a completely white toy so if you

like a completely white toy so if you
ever<00:02:17.970> see<00:02:18.180> one<00:02:18.210> that's<00:02:18.480> completely<00:02:18.630> white

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
ever see one that's completely white

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:20.480 
ever see one that's completely white
that's<00:02:19.200> not<00:02:19.410> actually<00:02:19.740> how<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.040> was

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
that's not actually how it was

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.090 
that's not actually how it was
originally<00:02:20.700> released<00:02:21.260> it<00:02:22.260> was<00:02:22.410> that's<00:02:22.920> put

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
originally released it was that's put

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.500 
originally released it was that's put
together<00:02:23.250> with<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.640> part<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.970> the<00:02:24.120> freighter

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
together with the part of the freighter

together with the part of the freighter
Tori<00:02:24.930> now<00:02:25.410> these<00:02:25.560> are<00:02:25.740> really<00:02:26.070> nice<00:02:26.280> toys<00:02:26.610> and

Tori now these are really nice toys and
I<00:02:27.090> would<00:02:27.270> say<00:02:27.450> ones<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.230> are<00:02:28.350> well<00:02:28.710> worth

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
I would say ones that are well worth

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.770 
I would say ones that are well worth
getting<00:02:29.100> they<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:29.730> have<00:02:29.910> some<00:02:30.180> serious

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
getting they just have some serious

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.840 
getting they just have some serious
weight<00:02:31.020> too<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:31.860> let's<00:02:32.070> take<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> look<00:02:32.580> at<00:02:32.700> the

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
weight too so let's take a look at the

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:36.560 
weight too so let's take a look at the
Eagle<00:02:33.330> freighter<00:02:34.730> with<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.910> Eagle<00:02:36.300> freighter

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
Eagle freighter with the Eagle freighter

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.300 
Eagle freighter with the Eagle freighter
this<00:02:36.840> is<00:02:37.170> essentially<00:02:37.680> the<00:02:37.830> same<00:02:38.010> sort<00:02:38.280> of

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
this is essentially the same sort of

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.010 
this is essentially the same sort of
outer<00:02:38.520> part<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.180> model<00:02:39.450> but<00:02:39.840> the

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
outer part of the model but the

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.200 
outer part of the model but the
transport<00:02:40.830> section<00:02:41.010> has<00:02:41.280> been<00:02:41.700> replaced<00:02:41.940> with

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
transport section has been replaced with

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.090 
transport section has been replaced with
a<00:02:43.430> nuclear<00:02:44.430> waste<00:02:44.700> carrying<00:02:45.270> a<00:02:45.360> setup<00:02:46.290> again

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
a nuclear waste carrying a setup again

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.400 
a nuclear waste carrying a setup again
this<00:02:47.250> can<00:02:47.430> be<00:02:47.490> released<00:02:48.210> if<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.600> land<00:02:49.260> the

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
it detaches and it can be picked up

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.840 
it detaches and it can be picked up
again<00:02:53.520> and<00:02:54.360> these<00:02:54.570> small<00:02:54.900> canisters<00:02:55.410> are

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.060 
out with the transporter to get an
all-white<00:03:20.700> eagle<00:03:21.330> and<00:03:22.019> then<00:03:22.200> there<00:03:22.380> is<00:03:22.470> also<00:03:22.650> a

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
all-white eagle and then there is also a

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.520 
all-white eagle and then there is also a
blue<00:03:23.640> version<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.810> actually<00:03:25.050> quite<00:03:25.320> liked<00:03:25.500> the

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
blue version I actually quite liked the

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.310 
blue version I actually quite liked the
blue<00:03:25.800> it<00:03:25.980> looks<00:03:26.010> quite<00:03:26.760> sort<00:03:27.239> of<00:03:27.300> striking<00:03:27.750> and

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
blue it looks quite sort of striking and

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.740 
blue it looks quite sort of striking and
as<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.680> can<00:03:28.769> see<00:03:28.830> the<00:03:29.100> mid<00:03:29.400> freighter<00:03:30.269> section

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
as you can see the mid freighter section

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:33.110 
as you can see the mid freighter section
it<00:03:31.050> also<00:03:31.350> available<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.980> white<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.850> if<00:03:32.940> you'll

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
it also available in white and if you'll

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.690 
it also available in white and if you'll
find<00:03:33.390> combinations<00:03:34.050> of<00:03:34.170> all<00:03:34.320> of<00:03:34.500> these

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
find combinations of all of these

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.580 
find combinations of all of these
variants<00:03:35.700> so<00:03:35.900> it's<00:03:36.900> there's<00:03:37.170> no<00:03:37.290> sort<00:03:37.530> of

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
variants so it's there's no sort of

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.949 
variants so it's there's no sort of
standard<00:03:38.070> setup<00:03:38.310> for<00:03:38.670> it<00:03:38.730> again<00:03:39.690> as<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:39.900> can

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
standard setup for it again as you can

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.840 
standard setup for it again as you can
