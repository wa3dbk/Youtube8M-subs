00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
doing pretty well but struggling with

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.689 
doing pretty well but struggling with
the<00:00:24.869> rear<00:00:25.050> retires<00:00:25.560> through<00:00:26.160> through<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
the rear retires through through the

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.759 
the rear retires through through the
long<00:00:26.820> runs<00:00:27.029> just<00:00:27.539> they<00:00:27.750> drop<00:00:27.990> off<00:00:28.140> /<00:00:28.380> very<00:00:28.560> very

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
long runs just they drop off / very very

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.740 
long runs just they drop off / very very
quickly<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.310> at<00:00:30.029> somewhere<00:00:30.390> we<00:00:30.510> need<00:00:30.630> to

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
it's this something the temperature is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.330 
it's this something the temperature is
very<00:00:47.460> very<00:00:47.579> tough<00:00:47.820> on<00:00:48.059> these<00:00:48.690> tires<00:00:49.010> this<00:00:50.010> this

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
very very tough on these tires this this

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.220 
very very tough on these tires this this
track<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:50.820> need<00:00:51.000> to<00:00:51.090> have<00:00:51.239> very<00:00:51.870> very<00:00:52.140> good

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
track you need to have very very good

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
track you need to have very very good

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
downforce I mean we've got good down for

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.790 
downforce I mean we've got good down for
so<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.750> don't<00:00:55.050> know<00:00:55.110> what<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> Ferrari<00:00:55.710> is

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
running that you they went massively

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.569 
running that you they went massively
quick<00:00:57.320> fuel<00:00:58.320> load<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.920> know<00:00:59.010> 10<00:00:59.280> kilos<00:00:59.550> of

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
quick fuel load is you know 10 kilos of

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.819 
quick fuel load is you know 10 kilos of
fuel<00:00:59.850> here<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.270> what<00:01:00.449> three<00:01:00.719> tenths<00:01:00.930> so

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
fuel here is like what three tenths so

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.490 
fuel here is like what three tenths so
you<00:01:02.430> don't<00:01:02.609> know<00:01:02.730> just<00:01:03.390> how<00:01:03.510> light<00:01:04.049> they<00:01:04.470> are

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
you don't know just how light they are

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.539 
you don't know just how light they are
going<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.280> I<00:01:05.610> pray<00:01:05.820> they<00:01:05.970> go<00:01:06.119> and<00:01:06.270> light<00:01:07.549> but

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
going and I pray they go and light but

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.580 
going and I pray they go and light but
we've<00:01:09.090> got<00:01:09.689> improve<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> class<00:01:10.260> somehow<00:01:10.560> I

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
we've got improve the class somehow I

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.140 
we've got improve the class somehow I
think<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:10.979> just<00:01:11.130> really<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.729> use<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:11.880> tires

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
think it's just really the use of tires

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.730 
think it's just really the use of tires
I<00:01:12.360> think<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.600> didn't<00:01:12.780> get<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:13.020> the<00:01:13.380> first<00:01:13.560> lap

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
I think I didn't get the the first lap

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.580 
I think I didn't get the the first lap
of<00:01:13.890> my<00:01:14.010> option<00:01:14.310> tyre<00:01:14.490> run<00:01:14.750> and<00:01:15.750> that's<00:01:16.350> really

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
of my option tyre run and that's really

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.140 
of my option tyre run and that's really
where<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> tires<00:01:17.159> were<00:01:17.310> at<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> best<00:01:17.670> when<00:01:18.119> I

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
where the tires were at the best when I

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.899 
where the tires were at the best when I
came<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> do<00:01:18.869> my<00:01:19.020> second<00:01:19.549> second<00:01:20.549> attempt

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
came to do my second second attempt

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.670 
came to do my second second attempt
there<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.270> just<00:01:21.720> give<00:01:21.869> up<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.259> when<00:01:22.380> you<00:01:22.439> attack

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
there is just give up so when you attack

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.679 
there is just give up so when you attack
the<00:01:22.770> corners<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> rear<00:01:23.340> slides<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:23.939> as<00:01:24.479> soon

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
the corners the rear slides and as soon

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.050 
the corners the rear slides and as soon
it<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:24.900> for<00:01:25.650> people<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:26.009> understand<00:01:26.790> if<00:01:26.939> they

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
it is for people to understand if they

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.280 
it is for people to understand if they
ever<00:01:27.180> play<00:01:27.390> those<00:01:27.540> computer<00:01:27.900> games<00:01:28.049> where<00:01:28.229> you

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
ever play those computer games where you

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.140 
ever play those computer games where you
do<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.409> rallying<00:01:29.040> and<00:01:29.189> you<00:01:29.280> collect<00:01:29.670> kudos

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
do the rallying and you collect kudos

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.480 
do the rallying and you collect kudos
laps<00:01:30.990> for<00:01:31.200> sliding<00:01:31.590> that's<00:01:32.070> what<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.400> with

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
laps for sliding that's what you do with

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.859 
laps for sliding that's what you do with
these<00:01:32.579> tires<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.119> as<00:01:33.240> soon<00:01:33.360> they<00:01:33.540> get<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
these tires but as soon they get to a

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.060 
these tires but as soon they get to a
point<00:01:34.020> where<00:01:34.170> they<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.500> don't<00:01:34.650> work<00:01:34.770> anymore

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
point where they just don't work anymore

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.490 
point where they just don't work anymore
and<00:01:35.369> then<00:01:35.549> then<00:01:36.150> you're<00:01:36.299> done<00:01:36.450> so<00:01:36.780> it's<00:01:37.409> about

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
and then then you're done so it's about

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:38.719 
and then then you're done so it's about
trying<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.890> reduce<00:01:38.159> that<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:38.549> got<00:01:38.670> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
trying to reduce that so we got to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:39.620 
trying to reduce that so we got to
change<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.090> set<00:01:39.240> up<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.390> little<00:01:39.540> bit

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
change the set up a little bit

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.810 
change the set up a little bit
interrupted<00:01:40.409> session<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.130> morning<00:01:41.369> what<00:01:41.700> do

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
interrupted session this morning what do

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.920 
interrupted session this morning what do
you<00:01:41.909> make<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.420> problems<00:01:42.720> that<00:01:42.750> they've

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
you make of the problems that they've

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.359 
you make of the problems that they've
had<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.409> circuits<00:01:43.890> how<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.189> think

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
had with the circuits how do you think

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:45.800 
had with the circuits how do you think
the<00:01:44.430> cabs<00:01:44.640> are<00:01:44.759> writing<00:01:45.149> and<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> circuits

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
the cabs are writing and the circuits

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.499 
the cabs are writing and the circuits
feeling<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.890> Cubs<00:01:47.100> have<00:01:47.220> been<00:01:47.700> fine<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:47.970> didn't

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
feeling the Cubs have been fine I didn't

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.880 
feeling the Cubs have been fine I didn't
have<00:01:48.630> any<00:01:48.810> problems<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:49.170> any<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.320> those<00:01:49.590> but

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
have any problems with any of those but

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.280 
have any problems with any of those but
there<00:01:50.460> are<00:01:50.579> some<00:01:50.729> areas<00:01:50.909> where<00:01:51.180> they<00:01:51.299> have<00:01:51.509> as

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
there are some areas where they have as

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.690 
there are some areas where they have as
you<00:01:52.439> can<00:01:52.560> see<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.740> TV<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.159> bolts<00:01:53.369> are<00:01:53.460> coming

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
you can see on TV the bolts are coming

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.340 
you can see on TV the bolts are coming
out<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.939> they're<00:01:54.030> moving<00:01:54.210> we<00:01:54.810> must<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.079> taking

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
out and they're moving we must be taking

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.830 
out and they're moving we must be taking
some<00:01:55.500> serious<00:01:55.799> force<00:01:56.009> from<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.219> cars<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.840> I

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
some serious force from the cars and I

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.399 
some serious force from the cars and I
think<00:01:58.439> turn<00:01:58.710> 13

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
think turn 13

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.630 
think turn 13
and<00:02:00.499> turn<00:02:00.909> exit<00:02:01.909> of<00:02:01.999> turn<00:02:02.119> 14<00:02:03.069> and<00:02:04.069> somewhere

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
and turn exit of turn 14 and somewhere

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.669 
and turn exit of turn 14 and somewhere
else<00:02:04.819> I<00:02:04.939> actually<00:02:05.359> have<00:02:05.569> turned<00:02:05.749> 23<00:02:05.990> they've

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
else I actually have turned 23 they've

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.650 
else I actually have turned 23 they've
taken<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.100> curb<00:02:07.280> on<00:02:07.399> the<00:02:07.520> exit<00:02:07.789> out<00:02:07.939> and<00:02:08.149> one

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660 
taken the curb on the exit out and one

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.880 
taken the curb on the exit out and one
of<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.810> two<00:02:08.899> clubs<00:02:09.019> on<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.229> apex<00:02:09.560> out<00:02:09.739> and

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
of the two clubs on the apex out and

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.680 
of the two clubs on the apex out and
people<00:02:10.009> people<00:02:10.879> are<00:02:11.060> taking<00:02:11.150> advantage<00:02:11.629> of

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
people people are taking advantage of

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.479 
people people are taking advantage of
going<00:02:11.930> where<00:02:12.560> the<00:02:12.590> curb<00:02:12.830> would<00:02:13.040> would<00:02:13.430> have

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
going where the curb would would have

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.920 
going where the curb would would have
been<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.209> question<00:02:14.510> is<00:02:14.569> we<00:02:14.690> don't<00:02:14.780> know

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
been the question is we don't know

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.180 
been the question is we don't know
whether<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.290> curbs<00:02:15.500> if<00:02:15.620> we<00:02:15.709> put<00:02:15.890> that<00:02:15.920> back

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
whether the curbs if we put that back

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.190 
whether the curbs if we put that back
there<00:02:16.400> tonight<00:02:16.549> or<00:02:16.790> not<00:02:16.879> so<00:02:17.120> I've<00:02:18.019> been

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
there tonight or not so I've been

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.320 
there tonight or not so I've been
driving<00:02:18.560> to<00:02:18.709> how<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:18.980> Cubs<00:02:19.430> will<00:02:19.970> be<00:02:20.090> a

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
driving to how the Cubs will be a

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.789 
driving to how the Cubs will be a
potentially<00:02:21.019> be<00:02:21.200> if<00:02:21.319> they<00:02:21.440> put<00:02:21.590> them<00:02:21.709> back

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
potentially be if they put them back

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.860 
potentially be if they put them back
them<00:02:22.400> back<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.819> if<00:02:22.970> not<00:02:23.180> then<00:02:23.360> we<00:02:23.540> should<00:02:23.690> gain

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
them back and if not then we should gain

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.960 
them back and if not then we should gain
another<00:02:24.110> couple<00:02:24.500> attempts<00:02:24.769> hopefully<00:02:25.129> by

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
another couple attempts hopefully by

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.910 
another couple attempts hopefully by
running<00:02:26.269> wider<00:02:26.450> so<00:02:26.930> we'll<00:02:27.500> see<00:02:27.650> how<00:02:27.680> that<00:02:27.860> goes

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
running wider so we'll see how that goes

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.190 
running wider so we'll see how that goes
tomorrow
