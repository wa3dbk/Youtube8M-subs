00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.610
 Let's record a new video here. 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.610
 Here Rodrigo borga 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.359
 what internet dump does not load will stay 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.340
 one of the themes most requested one of the most 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.359
 commented who said I do not read the 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.189
 comments were many many 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.650
 comments same people asking people 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.800
 begging people crying people running 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.260
 naked on the street and I took time to do 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.690
 this theme because I did not want to saturate 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.010
 gta channel and it has to be a 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.829
 special moment 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.350
 Moreover, the focus of this channel is not only 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.850
 video of gta in other things too 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.829
 very interesting that I want to bring 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.899
 ahead and I know everyone 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.899
 love him but when you get there 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.600
 some characters characteristic of the 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.270
 game had a peta appearance that 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.759
 It's scary to call me for example. 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.680
 march on work she is well up cute 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.520
 well done alone larger possibly 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.040
 beta 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.259
 but in the beta version appears all bugged 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.509
 still looks like women full of 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.580
 chicken feet after 40 p.m. 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.800
 on the face very different from the version that 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.509
 We also know well that it seems 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.369
 did a plastic talking on foot 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.049
 chicken the book as it obtained a 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.420
 I think it looks much worse than it was 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:38.420
 michelle looks like this is pure stone 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.399
 and not to mention that he did not wear glasses and 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.380
 Of course our protagonist 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.229
 only rosberg who also had his version 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.390
 beta his hair was slightly more 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:50.440
 long as well and eyes also a little 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.440
 more expressive 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.080
 I keep asking myself until today what 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.690
 did it happen with the gloves of the disc 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:02.119
 beck they had in art work several 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.979
 pre-release game images 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.500
 the first mission of the game would be during 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.330
 the afternoon and not the evening one of the finals 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.099
 even that was what I 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.830
 I played I will not say much to not 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:15.110
 to give spoiler he would not have that rain 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.630
 I believe even when I played that 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.459
 this rainstorm and thunder 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.770
 it was added to give more air 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.069
 dramatic end of the game and I think 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.069
 they did it 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:41.580
 and the famous clothing stores as well as I 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.760
 until zippy z would be present in the gta 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.370
 4 a pity it is not the only one would be very 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.020
 more stylish than these clothes 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.810
 ridiculous and Russian all 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.910
 other areas would also have their appearance 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.810
 and others have not even appeared in the 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.660
 game 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.040
 gta 4 you can pick up a camera and 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.600
 taka in someone's head 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.150
 but someone could have planned what 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:10.140
 You took photos with her and so 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:12.870
 the cell phone that the son of the 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.540
 it may be that the car gives nil in the version 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.370
 beta of the game was a box I as always 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.080
 almost all the changes of all 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:21.690
 internal versions in the beta for the 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.190
 end up on the cars but for 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.840
 It 's awesome are even the 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:28.080
 air vehicles 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:30.180
 the aircraft and gta 4 also had some 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.490
 chosen aircraft and the reason for 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:33.270
 removal explained by rockstar is very 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.600
 simple 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.050
 release is a cube-sized map is 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.430
 too small to fly in 

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.760
 job 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.700
 This was a disappointment and I know I had 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:50.520
 a lot of aircraft on the 4 gta you saw and 

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.620
 who piloted and failed and the ring read 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.530
 that appears in the second trailer 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.480
 it is slightly different from the final version 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.520
 almost no difference but it is noticed that 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.440
 does not have that yellow band and this one 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.610
 helicopter and caused in matches 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.709
 online was very strong 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.660
 before playing gta4 i was very 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.340
 curious to know what it was like to get 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.260
 a taxi leaves walking as if it were a 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:12.150
 passenger at the time he launched the game 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.400
 this is a very new thing nowadays 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:17.250
 it's a common and very useful thing 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.609
 gta 4 was the first to incorporate this 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.010
 new novelty, but moreover you 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.940
 could travel on a street like 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:26.010
 passenger 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.660
 you'd pay a little more than the taxi 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.230
 but could go to your destination 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.460
 watching tv lavish luxury same hey 

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.400
 the cabin 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.860
 but this was so useless it was removed 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:43.310
 and even the nice chubby we 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:43.310
 he loves rome he would have this job 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.520
 ae 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:05:01.860
 nevertheless the technicians a famous 

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.290
 franchise pizzeria 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:09.030
 it is not known why it was removed 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:11.480
 gta 4 and the only cell phone mp3 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.220
 what would gta do without his famous 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.500
 prostitutes in the gta 4 years hitherto half 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.930
 absent even you feel a little 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.110
 lack of it right but in beta 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:26.550
 game you could take them home and 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:28.500
 and this function was removed in the 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.370
 tiny map possibly from version 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:30.890
 beta 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.230
 note that the international airport 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:37.260
 French would have an extra clue and liberty 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:39.030
 The city would have snow and let's make snow 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:41.160
 now because it's so damn cool 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.380
 in the video you 're seeing just being there 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:45.510
 here is a heat of your fucking 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.860
 thief is doing the 40 degree cast 

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:49.350
 As you said in previous videos. 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.900
 goals that many things have been 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:54.090
 withdrawn because of these limitations of the 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:56.160
 video hardware angels side of the 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.680
 radio from past generations 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.020
 of course the playstation 3 radio and 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.420
 will also be a bit 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:05.700
 fart a little and many things that 

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.140
 left the game with more realism as 

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.990
 snow in some places of liberty city 

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:11.460
 was removed because of this and we have to 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.460
 take into account that many things 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.170
 added and many things too 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.600
 withdrawals were made intentionally 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:21.540
 to increase the realism of the game and even 

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:23.820
 so in 2008 he still jumped on the 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.160
 Franchise in question of realism I go 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:27.840

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:29.460
