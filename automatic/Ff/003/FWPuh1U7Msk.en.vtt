00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:09.630
 Tell me guys, what are you doing? 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.690
 here on e3 2015 on the second day to 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.470
 some stands and areas 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.260
 stay here in this class of witches 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:22.320
 now we're going to trust that ubisoft 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:24.600
 is well centered here in this lesson already 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.920
 that in the entrance we have several posters 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.130
 the games were presented in the 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.329
 conference in bonn sint gol was like 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:39.210
 was announced on Monday 11/10 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:44.100
 2016 year 2,205 this side of here half trek 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.649
 of 20 years 60 and 85 hot and the colonel 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.270
 also announced on Monday when 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.399
 she spent here has seen far 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.399
 within the ubisoft wing area 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.879
 personal're playing as not the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:04.140
 four seasons a bit smaller 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:10.920
 we found in Brazilian karak 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:13.380
 I think I play 100 women and that 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.840
 personal return is very great in brazil 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.000
 I think he plays in the market he is always 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.650
 appearing in the game place here is where 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.780
 doing could be in addition to the 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:27.619
 corner is just rolling not yet 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.619
 announced on Monday 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:35.720
 this is the idea of ​​an internet plus me 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.490
 I do not do it, but there are those who tell you more 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.320
 liked that we say we'll 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.080
 check with the big surprise with the 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:51.340
 answer that the cool corolla is a game 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:54.619
 normal and 0 to 100 a car with the same 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.930
 way to play but the return 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:03.350
 time is not talking after, do not need 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.490
 do this because printouts do 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:12.320
 colonel 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:14.870
 I only talk about the year so week 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:19.130
 they went to me in piles true to 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:23.450
 It's true there and Rio de Janeiro. 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:29.090
 the black plate shirt developer 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:36.489
 here every day and is the new problem in the 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:36.489
 own northeast happens in mexico 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:44.630
 all day 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:47.090
 The young man was under Paul was legal legal. 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.910
 You are doing a double by use of the area 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.170
 the euro just because it shows exactly 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.790
 from the posters and even already have a 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.560
 cosplay a state 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.390
 the brasilian people could not tell 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.250
 who does not know exactly what's going on here 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.870
 inside the larger conference 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.209
 but here we have to show why 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.910
 It's more or less the way it works. 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:07.190
 thank you early so did not have a dream 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:16.040
 People in Brazil use it back there. 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:18.350
 so I think the staff is 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.980
 meeting to play the colonel went into 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:26.170
 a queue if I'm not mistaken and the game 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.170
 can not be recorded well closed 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.660
 We'll try to play later. 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:34.430
 pass the business will surely you 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.380
 same as the corridor was Fidié 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.770
 more efficient 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:42.760
 closed can not shoot staff enter 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:44.590
 plays the media will dictate will not explain 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.870
 in text your impressions but the people 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.470
 can not shoot everything very closed between 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:53.820
 This year, dear, we have to 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.820
 same thing with lyon goals 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.610
 apparently even more restricted because 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:07.270
 You do not have much personal son's up the 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:11.680
 name must be scheduled and shares the same 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:14.890
 thing is almost nothing of hands on me so 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.780
 which we call the software network because 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:26.020
 watches sometimes have the opportunity to 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:28.360
 record but when you record is the soldier 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.220
 Did you remember going there? 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.980
 so you are very recent to us 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.980
 we marked later a one 'tour' 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.120
 by the things of ubisoft the already scheduled 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:39.940
 to see if we can get some 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.100
 thing that is just to see to see what people 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.720
 can really play but we pass by 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:45.040
 impressions for you later 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.930
 basically here stand the 

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:48.670
 software in the middle is not rolling 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.040
 She also interviews some 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.130
 comrades performing there 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:55.660
 Yesterday, the character of these 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.640
 facebook networks 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.320
 let's see what rolls going forward and 

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:01.510
 stay connected what she thinks games 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:04.180
 we'll go through all the others 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:05.950
 booths all other areas make a 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.470
 club show exactly everything has to 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.480
 have three names in the visual part by 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.800
 less occurs 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.800
 This is the next video.
