look<00:01:38.189> at<00:01:38.280> that<00:01:38.400> why<00:01:38.880> put<00:01:39.240> it<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.630> a<00:01:39.840> package<00:01:40.049> if

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
look at that why put it in a package if

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.679 
look at that why put it in a package if
it's<00:01:40.770> gonna<00:01:40.890> be<00:01:41.070> in<00:01:41.130> this<00:01:41.250> too<00:01:41.540> I've<00:01:42.540> heard

wrapped chocolates so I suppose perhaps

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.780

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370
