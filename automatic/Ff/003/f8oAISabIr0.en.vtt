 immunofluorescence and metric site 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.130
 flow technique is an assay 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.800
 that allows to analyze multiple 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.380
 phenotype parameters in one type 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.480
 cellular this technique has a 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.960
 clinical diagnostic application and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.289
 prognosis in several pathologies for 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.390
 perform this technique we use a 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.210
 cell suspension corresponding to the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.460
 sample and the flow cytometer the 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.300
 cell suspension is prepared in the phase 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.820
 called pre cytometry this 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.059
 suspension is composed of cells to 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.910
 study more monoclonal antibodies 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.890
 marked with fluorescent reagents 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.949
 These markers can be binding 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.829
 covalent and non-covalent or molecules 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.809
 organic and fluorescent proteins that 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.719
 they are used according to the protocol of 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.909
 study these antibodies have been 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.329
 designed to join deferr 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.049
 specific antigens if this existed 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:15.960
 in the cells he flow cytometer 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:17.909
 is composed of three systems a 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.299
 flow system that contains the 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:24.209
 cellular suspension an optical system that 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.299
 consists of a laser two detectors 

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:29.520
 luminaires called forward scatter and 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.789
 side scatter and the detectors 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.429
 fluorescents last of a system 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:38.450
 electronic that is in charge of receiving and 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.450
 process the data 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.580
 once the cell suspension is prepared 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.640
 the flow system is injected where 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.850
 the cells will pass one by one and they will be 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.490
 traversed by the laser beam this 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.160
 will cause the light to scatter towards 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.369
 forward to the light detector for war 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.890
 skater who provides the information about 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.080
 the size of the cell is also 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.140
 will cause the light to scatter 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.869
 laterally towards the light detector 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.260
 side skater providing information 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:17.160
 of cellular complexity is to say the 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.380
 granulation and morphology the cells in 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.810
 which the complex has been produced 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.850
 antibody antigen emit the 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.520
 fluorescence that is captured by the 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:30.220
 fluorescent detectors allowing 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:33.110
 the detection of cell-type immuno 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.900
 finally the cells are directed 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.420
 to different collecting tubules that 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.030
 classify the cell populations of 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.150
 according to the measured parameters these 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.690
 data will be processed and graphed by 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.420
 site meter software 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.090
 of each of the cells that crosses 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:55.080
 the laser is saved a series of 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.340
 parameters the different flower or cards 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.940
 detected the complexity of its 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.200
 cytoplasm and the size of the cell 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.540
 depending on the number of parameters to 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.950
 compare can be made different 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.319
 types of representation 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.420
 in this story more is shown the 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.120
 distribution of cells according to their 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.739
 size in this case a clear 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.739
 the predominance of neutrophils 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:24.459
 for example this technique is very 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:27.489
 used for the identification of 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.950
 types of leukemia from one 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.680
 Bone marrow sample is allowed 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.860
 determine if this myeloid type or 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:38.890
 lymphoid if it is from an ot cell lineage 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:41.200
 and if it is acute or chronic what allows 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:43.319
 choose the right treatment for the 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.319
 patient 

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:50.900
 in this chart the table shows the 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.660
 typical expression of the score of 38 for 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.300
 acute lymphoid leukemia type b what 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.709
 indicates poor prognosis or poor response 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.709
 of the patient the treatment
