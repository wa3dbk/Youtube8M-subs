00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
that photo is trying to do two tricks at

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.940 
that photo is trying to do two tricks at

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.700 

in<00:00:49.850> order<00:00:50.030> to<00:00:50.090> avoid<00:00:50.480> rewarding<00:00:51.350> this<00:00:51.470> trick

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
in order to avoid rewarding this trick

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.350 
in order to avoid rewarding this trick
along<00:00:51.920> with<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.130> hand<00:00:52.340> targeting<00:00:52.670> I'm<00:00:53.120> just

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
along with the hand targeting I'm just

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:02.350 
along with the hand targeting I'm just
going<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:53.540> simply<00:00:53.690> change<00:00:54.350> my<00:00:54.560> location

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:02.360 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:04.360 

again<00:01:03.110> the<00:01:03.410> handwriting's<00:01:03.920> just<00:01:04.100> a<00:01:04.190> little

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:04.370 
again the handwriting's just a little

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.920 
again the handwriting's just a little
bit<00:01:04.489> more<00:01:04.730> difficult<00:01:05.150> than<00:01:05.239> the<00:01:05.449> collar<00:01:05.630> grab

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
bit more difficult than the collar grab

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.810 
bit more difficult than the collar grab
because<00:01:06.590> Frodo<00:01:06.950> actually<00:01:07.130> has<00:01:07.430> to<00:01:07.550> look<00:01:07.670> away

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
because Frodo actually has to look away

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:19.120 
because Frodo actually has to look away
from<00:01:07.970> the<00:01:08.240> manners<00:01:08.480> minor<00:01:08.690> to<00:01:08.870> get<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.080> cookie

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.950 

you<00:01:19.880> also<00:01:20.030> notice<00:01:20.270> that<00:01:20.450> I'm<00:01:20.570> trying<00:01:20.780> to<00:01:20.810> keep

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
you also notice that I'm trying to keep

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.959 
you also notice that I'm trying to keep
the<00:01:21.049> frequency<00:01:21.289> pretty<00:01:21.680> high<00:01:21.860> and<00:01:22.130> you'll

00:01:22.959 --> 00:01:22.969 
the frequency pretty high and you'll

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:24.789 
the frequency pretty high and you'll
also<00:01:23.119> notice<00:01:23.450> now<00:01:23.719> about<00:01:24.469> halfway<00:01:24.680> through

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:24.799 
also notice now about halfway through

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:26.109 
also notice now about halfway through
the<00:01:25.009> training<00:01:25.310> session<00:01:25.579> I'm<00:01:25.729> no<00:01:25.939> longer

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
the training session I'm no longer

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:27.969 
the training session I'm no longer
rewarding<00:01:26.689> on<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:26.990> first<00:01:27.229> hand<00:01:27.590> target

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
rewarding on the first hand target

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:29.649 
rewarding on the first hand target
sometimes<00:01:28.430> I'm<00:01:28.729> making<00:01:28.970> them<00:01:29.060> target<00:01:29.450> twice

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:29.659 
sometimes I'm making them target twice

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.109 
sometimes I'm making them target twice
before<00:01:30.049> I<00:01:30.079> reinforce<00:01:30.649> so<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.369> I<00:01:31.399> can<00:01:31.670> get<00:01:31.820> a

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
before I reinforce so that I can get a

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.980 
before I reinforce so that I can get a
firmer<00:01:33.110> hand<00:01:33.289> target<00:01:34.689> now<00:01:35.689> I'm<00:01:35.780> going<00:01:35.929> to

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990 
firmer hand target now I'm going to

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:37.359 
firmer hand target now I'm going to
change<00:01:36.140> my<00:01:36.259> orientation<00:01:36.920> because<00:01:37.070> I<00:01:37.220> don't

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
change my orientation because I don't

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.980 
change my orientation because I don't
really<00:01:37.520> want<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.850> reward<00:01:37.970> my<00:01:38.270> dog<00:01:38.479> for

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
really want to reward my dog for

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.630 
really want to reward my dog for
thousands<00:01:39.409> of<00:01:39.470> hand<00:01:39.710> targets<00:01:40.100> right<00:01:40.429> in<00:01:40.490> front

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
thousands of hand targets right in front
