00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
but a sort of a neat map you can see

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.660 
but a sort of a neat map you can see
there's<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.229> four<00:02:07.680> bridges<00:02:08.009> across<00:02:08.280> the

the<00:02:16.800> map<00:02:17.010> is<00:02:17.130> basically<00:02:17.700> cut<00:02:17.970> in<00:02:18.060> half<00:02:18.330> by<00:02:18.750> this

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
lot of the pads around the map and

natural<00:02:36.150> i<00:02:36.360> think<00:02:36.569> i<00:02:36.720> did<00:02:36.930> you<00:02:37.650> buy<00:02:37.950> ilica<00:02:39.620> intl

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
natural i think i did you buy ilica intl

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.500 
natural i think i did you buy ilica intl
me<00:02:40.800> that's<00:02:41.100> either<00:02:41.280> basis<00:02:41.700> was<00:02:41.880> hard<00:02:42.120> to<00:02:42.300> see

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
me that's either basis was hard to see

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.960 
me that's either basis was hard to see
with<00:02:42.750> that<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.709> amount<00:02:43.890> of<00:02:44.040> marking<00:02:44.760> sitter

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
with that the amount of marking sitter

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.560 
with that the amount of marking sitter
on<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.570> map<00:02:45.750> paddle<00:02:46.530> but<00:02:46.880> there's<00:02:47.880> a<00:02:47.940> about

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
on the map paddle but there's a about

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:51.680 
on the map paddle but there's a about
four<00:02:49.350> bases<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:49.950> each<00:02:50.250> side<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.550> the<00:02:50.670> map<00:02:50.880> that

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
four bases on each side of the map that

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.309 
four bases on each side of the map that
each<00:02:52.080> player<00:02:52.380> can<00:02:52.410> claim<00:02:52.860> it<00:02:53.040> so<00:02:53.660> like<00:02:54.660> like<00:02:55.260> a

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
each player can claim it so like like a

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.340 
each player can claim it so like like a
lot<00:02:55.530> of<00:02:55.620> these<00:02:55.709> early<00:02:56.040> Maps<00:02:56.250> there's

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:57.350 
lot of these early Maps there's

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:01.940 
lot of these early Maps there's
relatively<00:02:58.350> low-tech<00:02:59.310> resource<00:03:00.950> relatively

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:01.950 
relatively low-tech resource relatively

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.920 
relatively low-tech resource relatively
yeah<00:03:02.610> relatively<00:03:03.150> sparse<00:03:03.420> resources

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
yeah relatively sparse resources

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:06.199 
yeah relatively sparse resources
compared<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.620> what<00:03:05.280> we<00:03:05.370> see<00:03:05.580> in<00:03:05.640> a<00:03:05.700> more<00:03:05.880> modern

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
compared to what we see in a more modern

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.390 
compared to what we see in a more modern
map<00:03:06.390> was<00:03:06.930> you<00:03:07.380> know<00:03:07.500> modern<00:03:07.739> two<00:03:08.040> player<00:03:08.190> maps

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
map was you know modern two player maps

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.729 
map was you know modern two player maps
like<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.880> we've<00:03:09.630> storm<00:03:09.900> or<00:03:10.110> something

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
like that we've storm or something

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.920 
like that we've storm or something
we<00:03:11.250> see<00:03:12.140> what<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.260> about<00:03:13.560> 25<00:03:14.100> bases<00:03:14.610> per<00:03:15.600> side<00:03:15.900> I

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
we see what is about 25 bases per side I

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.699 
we see what is about 25 bases per side I
think<00:03:16.519> ya<00:03:17.519> could<00:03:18.510> be<00:03:18.630> wrong<00:03:18.780> about<00:03:18.989> that<00:03:19.110> you

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
think ya could be wrong about that you

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.910 
think ya could be wrong about that you
got<00:03:19.860> think<00:03:20.100> they're<00:03:20.250> five<00:03:21.120> aces<00:03:21.650> per<00:03:22.650> player

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
got think they're five aces per player

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:29.030 
got think they're five aces per player
oh<00:03:23.959> but<00:03:24.959> in<00:03:25.410> any<00:03:25.860> event<00:03:27.470> plays<00:03:28.470> in<00:03:28.680> this<00:03:28.829> or

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
oh but in any event plays in this or

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.949 
oh but in any event plays in this or
slightly<00:03:29.340> lowered<00:03:29.790> each<00:03:29.880> on<00:03:30.120> style<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.870> we

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
slightly lowered each on style that we

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.870 
slightly lowered each on style that we
saw<00:03:31.140> from<00:03:31.170> these<00:03:31.470> players<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:32.100> we<00:03:32.640> can<00:03:32.760> see

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:32.880 
saw from these players and we can see

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.900 
saw from these players and we can see
both<00:03:33.030> players<00:03:33.329> getting<00:03:34.370> early<00:03:35.370> barracks<00:03:35.760> and
