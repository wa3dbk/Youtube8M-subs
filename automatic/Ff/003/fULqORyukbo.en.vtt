00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
short cuz it's so vast so big a lot of

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.530 
short cuz it's so vast so big a lot of
off-leash<00:01:39.410> dogs<00:01:39.740> here<00:01:40.130> at<00:01:40.430> the<00:01:40.610> park<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:40.940> we're

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.170 
off-leash dogs here at the park so we're
kind<00:01:41.720> of<00:01:41.780> hanging<00:01:42.020> out<00:01:42.229> here<00:01:42.470> in<00:01:42.560> the<00:01:42.650> corner

dogs<00:01:46.040> obvious<00:01:47.000> I<00:01:47.210> think<00:01:47.450> that<00:01:47.600> goes<00:01:47.750> without

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869 
dogs obvious I think that goes without

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:48.430 
dogs obvious I think that goes without
saying

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
saying

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.140 
saying
but<00:01:48.860> when<00:01:48.979> I<00:01:49.009> practice<00:01:49.520> I<00:01:49.640> like<00:01:49.820> to<00:01:49.970> practice

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
but when I practice I like to practice

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.260 
but when I practice I like to practice
with<00:01:50.660> as<00:01:50.869> few<00:01:51.320> dogs<00:01:51.890> around<00:01:52.250> as<00:01:52.520> possible<00:01:52.550> not

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
with as few dogs around as possible not

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.359 
with as few dogs around as possible not
because<00:01:53.920> my<00:01:54.920> dogs<00:01:55.160> really<00:01:55.720> are<00:01:57.369> affected

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
because my dogs really are affected

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.920 
because my dogs really are affected
while<00:01:58.520> it's<00:01:58.910> just<00:01:59.150> the<00:01:59.360> other<00:01:59.479> dogs<00:01:59.720> will

00:01:59.920 --> 00:01:59.930 
while it's just the other dogs will

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.420 
while it's just the other dogs will
start<00:02:00.140> chasing<00:02:00.560> them<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:00.740> chasing<00:02:01.280> their

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
start chasing them and chasing their

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.219 
start chasing them and chasing their
frisbees<00:02:01.790> and<00:02:01.940> it<00:02:02.030> just<00:02:02.210> throws<00:02:02.930> off<00:02:03.050> our

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
frisbees and it just throws off our

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.109 
frisbees and it just throws off our
practice<00:02:03.710> you<00:02:03.890> know<00:02:04.009> can<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:04.820> see<00:02:04.970> these

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
practice you know can you see these

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.150 
practice you know can you see these
crows<00:02:05.570> on<00:02:05.840> top<00:02:06.050> of<00:02:06.200> this<00:02:06.320> tree<00:02:06.590> it's<00:02:06.830> kind<00:02:07.009> of<00:02:07.070> a

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
crows on top of this tree it's kind of a

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.850 
crows on top of this tree it's kind of a
scene<00:02:07.400> I<00:02:07.720> don't<00:02:08.720> know<00:02:08.840> it<00:02:09.110> looks<00:02:09.320> pretty<00:02:09.410> it

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
scene I don't know it looks pretty it

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.440 
scene I don't know it looks pretty it
would<00:02:09.950> be<00:02:10.040> a<00:02:10.070> good<00:02:10.190> photograph<00:02:10.459> but<00:02:11.150> I<00:02:11.180> don't

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
would be a good photograph but I don't

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.910 
would be a good photograph but I don't
have<00:02:11.510> a<00:02:11.570> good<00:02:11.840> enough<00:02:11.959> camera<00:02:12.410> because<00:02:12.709> the

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
have a good enough camera because the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.310 
have a good enough camera because the
zoom<00:02:13.190> on<00:02:13.430> the<00:02:13.640> iPhone<00:02:14.150> isn't<00:02:14.480> adequate<00:02:14.989> for

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
zoom on the iPhone isn't adequate for

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.759 
zoom on the iPhone isn't adequate for
this<00:02:15.650> type<00:02:16.130> of<00:02:16.160> picture<00:02:16.750> but<00:02:17.750> still<00:02:18.470> pretty

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
this type of picture but still pretty

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:24.160 
this type of picture but still pretty
cool<00:02:21.190> and<00:02:22.190> there's<00:02:22.370> water<00:02:22.610> over<00:02:22.790> here<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:24.050> I'm

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
cool and there's water over here so I'm

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.660 
cool and there's water over here so I'm
told<00:02:24.410> it's<00:02:24.650> probably<00:02:24.920> not<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.070> good<00:02:25.280> idea<00:02:25.430> to

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:25.670 
told it's probably not a good idea to

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.470 
told it's probably not a good idea to
let<00:02:25.790> the<00:02:25.910> dog<00:02:26.060> swim<00:02:26.480> could<00:02:27.260> be<00:02:27.410> alligators<00:02:28.480> and

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
let the dog swim could be alligators and

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:43.660 
let the dog swim could be alligators and
it<00:02:30.170> might<00:02:30.560> be<00:02:30.590> gross<00:02:30.980> water<00:02:40.900> I<00:02:42.610> don't<00:02:43.610> know

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
it might be gross water I don't know

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.180 
it might be gross water I don't know
