00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.080 
flash without any issues and and there's
the<00:01:28.650> design<00:01:28.979> that<00:01:29.189> I<00:01:29.250> show<00:01:29.460> up<00:01:29.729> on<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> back<00:01:30.060> of

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
the design that I show up on the back of

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.429 
the design that I show up on the back of
this<00:01:30.299> one<00:01:30.540> so<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:30.810> quite<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.990> cool<00:01:31.229> lot
