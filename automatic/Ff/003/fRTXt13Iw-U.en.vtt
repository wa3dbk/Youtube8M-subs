00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
through them so with the barrier it's

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:54.679 
through them so with the barrier it's
just<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.729> big<00:01:53.880> difference<00:01:54.270> between<00:01:54.570> the

half day in middle the cripple goes down

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.640 
half day in middle the cripple goes down
it<00:02:17.569> looks<00:02:17.750> like<00:02:17.870> they<00:02:18.020> will<00:02:18.170> start<00:02:18.410> with<00:02:18.530> the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
it looks like they will start with the

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.100 
it looks like they will start with the
same<00:02:18.830> abilities<00:02:19.450> yeah<00:02:20.450> interesting<00:02:20.989> that

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
same abilities yeah interesting that

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.690

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
bit slow the red elixir versus the cloth

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.809 
bit slow the red elixir versus the cloth
almost<00:02:27.860> tells<00:02:27.980> me<00:02:28.100> diamond<00:02:28.340> watch<00:02:28.489> to<00:02:28.610> hold
