and how do I know this is the this is
the<00:05:35.720> greatest<00:05:36.110> probability<00:05:36.580> because<00:05:37.580> our

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:37.760 
the greatest probability because our

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.379 
the greatest probability because our

because of privately hired security
force<00:05:52.460> says<00:05:52.729> so<00:05:53.060> and<00:05:53.360> because<00:05:53.930> a<00:05:53.960> man<00:05:54.229> who

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440

rides the train says so and because we

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.070 
rides the train says so and because we
got<00:05:56.810> a<00:05:56.960> fake<00:05:57.289> photo<00:05:57.789> of<00:05:58.789> a<00:05:59.000> PSYOP<00:05:59.570> derailment

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:03.460 
got a fake photo of a PSYOP derailment
that<00:06:00.590> is<00:06:00.800> absolutely<00:06:01.580> impossible<00:06:02.150> that<00:06:03.110> says

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
that is absolutely impossible that says

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.370 
that is absolutely impossible that says
so<00:06:03.830> there<00:06:04.639> are<00:06:04.940> no<00:06:05.270> illegal<00:06:05.720> immigrant

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:06.380 
so there are no illegal immigrant

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.110 
so there are no illegal immigrant
children<00:06:06.590> on<00:06:06.919> these<00:06:07.130> trains<00:06:07.460> at<00:06:07.669> least<00:06:07.880> not<00:06:08.090> in

they going segment two of this video
covers<00:06:25.010> the<00:06:25.190> other<00:06:25.760> possibility<00:06:26.719> that<00:06:27.409> these

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:27.740 
covers the other possibility that these

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:28.580 
covers the other possibility that these
illegal
