00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.120
 few friends we know of the young man who 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.340
 apparently it killed him 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.590
 referee ricardo portillo in yuta al 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.940
 hit him on the head after 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.190
 that he took out a yellow card 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.139
 during a football game and it's that 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.570
 because he is a minor because he hardly has 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.850
 17 years his identity can not be 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.410
 revealed that waiting and what charges 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.570
 could face live from the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.670
 california angels accompanies us from 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.720
 bilingual see to answer these 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.460
 Questions we all ask 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.880
 welcome you should thank you for being with 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.040
 we 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.199
 thank you region good morning the first 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:37.059
 question should this young man maybe be 

00:00:35.199 --> 00:00:39.590
 judged as a minor since it has 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:42.650
 17 years old 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.910
 Yes, they are less than 21 years old and 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.110
 they have committed a crime at age 17 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.650
 they will mainly treat it as a 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.920
 case of a minor and whether a prosecutor or 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.050
 a judge determines that the cases are so 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.020
 serious that you should treat it as a 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.390
 adult that situation can change now 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:05.300
 yesterday he feels that the family of ricardo 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.220
 portillo is obviously shattered from 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.260
 fact we talked yesterday live with 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.640
 joanna portillo the eldest daughter and I 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.740
 I would like you to hear what we 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.479
 he said when I asked him if the family of 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.920
 young had contacted them listen and 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.920
 now I speak and I ask him forward 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:26.130
 the family is not to blame for what 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.130
 happened I also feel ugly for them 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:33.780
 but I just want it to be bread 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.700
 to his parents the boy who 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.700
 we did huge damage 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.299
 my sisters are younger than me they 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.299
 they are suffering too 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.810
 I can not I 'm not nobody to tell 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.920
 from the east punishment or anything 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.830
 the punishment I leave to God 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.490
 because for me the punishment they give him 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:03.540
 he has no reason because that is not going to 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.540
 return to my dad 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.600
 is right in what joana says but of 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.340
 20 I wonder what is taken into account 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.160
 decision of the victim's family or 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.870
 whether they say they forgive him or not 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.880
 that they are not going to put charges this is taken 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.880
 in account when judging this young 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:25.090
 on the one hand, and on the other, not the 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.850
 decision to enter charges is only 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.640
 with the prosecution so if the prosecution 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.740
 decides to continue with the case 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.900
 necessarily take into account what 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:37.390
 tell the family of the victim what is 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.000
 see is that if a crime was committed they have 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.280
 to see consequences now is not to say 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.480
 that what the family says is not taken 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.210
 count for nothing 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:49.810
 for example the decision to take the case 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:52.750
 or treat the case as an adult case 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.880
 is something where they take into account if the 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.130
 family says we want to be treated like 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:00.310
 an adult case because that is already 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.900
 considers and would pass it to a prison of 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:05.770
 little adults is in a minor in 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:09.610
 case that happened or did not work 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:12.160
 had him arrested in a detention of 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.400
 juveniles and so is treated as a 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.860
 adult and they condemn it and that results in 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.390
 clear prison sentence 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.670
 thank you very much should matter 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:23.500
 clarifications because yesterday it did not remain as 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.820
 doubt would happen to this young man who 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.470
 in fact neither the identity can be left 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:29.700
 know thank you very much for being live 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.700
 with us from the angels
