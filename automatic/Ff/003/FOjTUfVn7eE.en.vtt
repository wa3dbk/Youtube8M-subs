someone from Philly to Charlotte because

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.139 
someone from Philly to Charlotte because
that's<00:00:31.650> just<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> easiest<00:00:32.520> way<00:00:32.730> to<00:00:32.790> do<00:00:33.000> these

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
that's just the easiest way to do these

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.110 
that's just the easiest way to do these
two<00:00:35.570> we<00:00:36.570> go<00:00:36.750> over<00:00:37.520> to<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.700> player<00:00:38.879> enough

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
two we go over to the player enough

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.760 
two we go over to the player enough
we've<00:00:39.300> got<00:00:39.750> player<00:00:39.960> number<00:00:40.110> here<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.530> is<00:00:40.649> how

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
we've got player number here this is how

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.580 
we've got player number here this is how
many<00:00:40.890> players<00:00:41.100> are<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.460> the<00:00:41.489> roster<00:00:42.059> um<00:00:42.590> you

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
many players are on the roster um you

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.680 
many players are on the roster um you
have<00:00:43.739> actually<00:00:44.010> have<00:00:44.129> up<00:00:44.219> to<00:00:44.309> 20<00:00:44.610> but<00:00:45.390> i<00:00:45.420> don't

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
have actually have up to 20 but i don't

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.340 
have actually have up to 20 but i don't
think<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.899> game<00:00:46.050> likes<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.500> if<00:00:46.770> you<00:00:46.920> do<00:00:47.070> that

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
think the game likes it if you do that

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.709 
think the game likes it if you do that
so<00:00:49.350> each<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.860> these<00:00:49.920> ID<00:00:50.160> numbers<00:00:50.550> 0<00:00:51.239> all<00:00:51.600> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
so each of these ID numbers 0 all the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.540 
so each of these ID numbers 0 all the
way<00:00:51.780> up<00:00:51.899> here<00:00:52.050> all<00:00:52.199> these<00:00:52.320> numbers<00:00:52.710> represent

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
way up here all these numbers represent

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.779 
way up here all these numbers represent
one<00:00:54.120> player<00:00:54.420> in<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.690> players<00:00:54.960> tab<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.949> 0<00:00:56.280> drew

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
one player in the players tab so 0 drew
