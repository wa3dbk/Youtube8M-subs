they're<00:05:00.730> it's<00:05:00.970> usually<00:05:01.180> sold<00:05:01.540> out<00:05:01.720> lego.com

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
they're it's usually sold out lego.com

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.990 
they're it's usually sold out lego.com
but<00:05:03.370> I'd<00:05:03.460> recommend<00:05:03.910> getting<00:05:04.060> it<00:05:05.340> and<00:05:06.340> the

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.000 
but I'd recommend getting it and the

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.940 
but I'd recommend getting it and the
thing<00:05:07.210> that<00:05:07.240> I<00:05:07.660> hope<00:05:08.110> I<00:05:08.350> hope<00:05:08.590> they<00:05:08.740> make

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
thing that I hope I hope they make

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.100 
thing that I hope I hope they make
another<00:05:09.190> one<00:05:09.460> and<00:05:09.700> I<00:05:10.030> hope<00:05:10.180> it's<00:05:10.390> like<00:05:10.450> bigger

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
another one and I hope it's like bigger

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:15.360 
another one and I hope it's like bigger
so<00:05:11.950> it's<00:05:12.130> more<00:05:12.310> scale<00:05:12.760> to<00:05:13.110> minifig<00:05:14.110> size<00:05:14.350> and<00:05:14.800> I

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
so it's more scale to minifig size and I

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.920 
so it's more scale to minifig size and I
hope<00:05:15.580> they<00:05:15.790> because<00:05:16.120> you<00:05:16.210> actually<00:05:16.540> watching
