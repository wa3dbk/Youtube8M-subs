00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
and then for the short program I fell on

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.100 
and then for the short program I fell on
like<00:02:15.750> a<00:02:15.780> cross<00:02:16.590> over<00:02:16.830> kind<00:02:17.250> of<00:02:17.370> something

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
like a cross over kind of something

after like a perfect triple axel and I
was<00:02:22.410> so<00:02:22.620> shocked<00:02:22.950> I<00:02:23.130> didn't<00:02:23.370> know<00:02:23.430> what

more<00:02:27.930> my<00:02:28.410> hip<00:02:28.709> where<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.010> went<00:02:29.160> down<00:02:29.430> started<00:02:29.970> to

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
more my hip where I went down started to

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.380 
more my hip where I went down started to
hurt<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.230> tighten<00:02:31.680> up<00:02:31.739> a<00:02:31.860> bit<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.580> was<00:02:33.180> kind

hurt and tighten up a bit and I was kind

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.430 
hurt and tighten up a bit and I was kind
of<00:02:33.420> in<00:02:33.540> la-la<00:02:33.750> land<00:02:34.019> for<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.290> whole

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
of in la-la land for the whole

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.870 
of in la-la land for the whole
performance<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:35.130> I<00:02:35.160> forgot<00:02:35.430> my<00:02:35.489> step

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
performance and I forgot my step

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.720 
performance and I forgot my step
sequences<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.950> it<00:02:37.950> was<00:02:38.400> just<00:02:38.580> such<00:02:38.700> a

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
sequences and it was just such a

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.110 
sequences and it was just such a
shocking<00:02:39.060> thing<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.510> happen<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.970> after<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
shocking thing to happen and after the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.880 
shocking thing to happen and after the
short<00:02:42.360> program<00:02:42.480> I<00:02:42.810> was<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:42.959> last<00:02:43.260> place<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.590> it

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
short program I was in last place and it

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.550 
short program I was in last place and it
wasn't<00:02:44.070> a<00:02:44.459> good<00:02:45.090> performance<00:02:45.600> by<00:02:45.750> any<00:02:46.170> means

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
wasn't a good performance by any means

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.930 
wasn't a good performance by any means
and<00:02:46.950> I<00:02:47.160> went<00:02:47.340> back<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.489> the<00:02:47.670> hotel<00:02:48.000> and<00:02:49.940> started

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
to prepare myself to do the long program

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.340 
to prepare myself to do the long program
and<00:02:53.120> just<00:02:54.120> kind<00:02:54.570> of<00:02:54.600> relax<00:02:54.900> a<00:02:55.050> little<00:02:55.140> bit
