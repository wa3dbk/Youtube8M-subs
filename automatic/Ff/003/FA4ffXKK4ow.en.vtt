00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:04.389
 yes 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.169
 that's why my platform sandals are 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.320
 my most precious object very educational to 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.739
 the time to clarify the following is 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.739
 caleta 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.989
 higher with days that gives you hours of 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.379
 fear and the most important object for me 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.680
 this necklace was given to me by my grandmother 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.660
 take my family ten generations their 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.300
 story began when the shaman of the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.110
 bonanza village was looking for the 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.309
 perfect gift for your little daughter other than 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:07.590
 those romantic and maudlin stories 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.540
 then the volcano erupted more 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.940
 in full confusion he saw something beautiful and 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.979
 unique as his little daughter but before 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.289
 I could reach it ended up in shreds 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.840
 in front of his eyes but good until 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:20.729
 I was very wise I knew I should find 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.520
 the way to create something good from pain and 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.680
 the tragedy the necklace was the beginning of 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.180
 that tradition the strong women know 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.610
 they delivered to the showy when 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.350
 they reached maturity and by far 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.320
 that life will push my family what 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.910
 we preserve from generation to generation 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.039
 so when my grandma was just one 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.860
 Chamaca a terrible event snatched 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.590
 the necklace thought that never 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.540
 I'm sleeping there's no in this 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.180
 history no car race or 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.490
 skeleton arches tell me how I recover 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.890
 the necklace my grandmother thought there was 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.080
 lost then he remembered the lesson 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.400
 of bonampak anything can be 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.010
 recover is at your side 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.600
 positive the loss of the necklace made him 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.090
 understand my granny that the most 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.270
 precious to her was her family and as 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.340
 by magic the necklace returned that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.560
 It was the most beautiful moment of his life 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:14.980
 and when my grandma handed it to me 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.739
 the most beautiful moment of my life and for 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.950
 that this necklace is my object more 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.950
