00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
the old layout or the new layout for

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.639 
the old layout or the new layout for
battles<00:00:38.460> so<00:00:39.030> for<00:00:39.600> battles<00:00:40.170> um<00:00:41.960> yeah<00:00:42.960> battles

battles so for battles um yeah battles
this<00:00:44.610> would<00:00:44.820> ended<00:00:45.210> up<00:00:45.360> being<00:00:45.980> either<00:00:46.980> this

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
this would ended up being either this

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.979 
this would ended up being either this
layout<00:00:47.579> where<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:47.940> see<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.239> move<00:00:48.600> said<00:00:48.840> on

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
layout where you see the move said on

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.389 
layout where you see the move said on
the<00:00:49.140> screen<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> entire<00:00:49.800> time<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.129> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
the screen the entire time and the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.529 
the screen the entire time and the
scoreboard<00:00:50.879> would<00:00:51.030> be<00:00:51.149> somewhere<00:00:51.510> else

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
scoreboard would be somewhere else

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.260 
scoreboard would be somewhere else
doesn't<00:00:51.989> necessarily<00:00:52.649> have<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.920> be<00:00:53.270> over

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
doesn't necessarily have to be over

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.209 
doesn't necessarily have to be over
there<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> could<00:00:55.079> actually<00:00:55.379> end<00:00:55.710> up<00:00:55.770> moving<00:00:55.949> it

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
there I could actually end up moving it

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.650 
there I could actually end up moving it
to<00:00:56.370> over<00:00:56.610> here<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.180> side<00:00:57.239> that's

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
to over here on this side that's

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.729 
to over here on this side that's
actually<00:00:58.079> something<00:00:58.230> i<00:00:58.500> would<00:00:58.590> consider

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
actually something i would consider

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:06.620 
actually something i would consider
doing<00:01:00.829> but<00:01:02.449> other<00:01:03.449> than<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:05.630> there's

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
doing but other than that on there's

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.250 
doing but other than that on there's
that<00:01:06.900> so<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:07.560> we<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.189> kind<00:01:08.760> of

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
that so there we have this kind of

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.780 
that so there we have this kind of
layout<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.560> then<00:01:10.650> we<00:01:10.740> also<00:01:10.890> have<00:01:11.070> over<00:01:11.490> here

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
layout and then we also have over here

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.520 
layout and then we also have over here
we<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.090> this<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.659> basically<00:01:12.780> what<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:13.470> is

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
we have this and basically what this is

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.760 
we have this and basically what this is
is<00:01:14.010> for<00:01:14.670> many<00:01:15.030> new<00:01:15.330> people<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:15.900> i'm<00:01:16.530> sure

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
most people have seen this but it kind

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.660 
most people have seen this but it kind
of<00:01:19.049> just<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.470> every<00:01:19.799> time<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.070> Pokemon<00:01:20.490> goes

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
of because that's probably going to be a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.710 
of because that's probably going to be a
pretty<00:01:49.770> big<00:01:50.009> determining<00:01:50.460> factor<00:01:50.820> now<00:01:51.030> it's

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
pretty big determining factor now it's

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:52.969 
pretty big determining factor now it's
all<00:01:51.869> going<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.049> be<00:01:52.140> redesigned<00:01:52.649> it's<00:01:52.829> not

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
all going to be redesigned it's not

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.530 
all going to be redesigned it's not
going<00:01:53.100> to<00:01:53.189> look<00:01:53.310> necessarily<00:01:54.030> like<00:01:54.210> this<00:01:54.420> or

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
going to look necessarily like this or

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.060 
going to look necessarily like this or
anything<00:01:54.689> it's<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.200> be<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.920> know

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
anything it's just going to be you know

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.980 
anything it's just going to be you know
if<00:01:56.340> I<00:01:56.460> did<00:01:56.670> do<00:01:56.790> this<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.210> would<00:01:57.299> be<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> small<00:01:57.780> bug

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
if I did do this it would be a small bug

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.380 
if I did do this it would be a small bug
like<00:01:58.290> this<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.740> won't<00:01:58.829> be<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.670> wouldn't<00:02:00.270> really

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
like this it won't be it wouldn't really

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.450 
like this it won't be it wouldn't really
look<00:02:00.719> honestly<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.890> wouldn't<00:02:02.040> have<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.280> same

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
look honestly you wouldn't have the same

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.249 
look honestly you wouldn't have the same
design<00:02:02.880> features<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.450> this<00:02:03.689> fort<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:04.020> mean<00:02:04.140> it

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
design features just this fort I mean it

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.280 
design features just this fort I mean it
would<00:02:04.439> but<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:06.180> would<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.479> updated<00:02:06.990> will<00:02:07.170> it

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
would but it it would be updated will it

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.960 
would but it it would be updated will it
look<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.770> lot<00:02:07.890> more<00:02:07.950> modern<00:02:08.759> and<00:02:09.000> whatnot<00:02:10.970> which

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
look a lot more modern and whatnot which

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.309 
look a lot more modern and whatnot which
is<00:02:12.120> what<00:02:12.270> I'm<00:02:12.360> trying<00:02:12.569> to<00:02:12.629> figure<00:02:12.750> out<00:02:12.989> right

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
is what I'm trying to figure out right

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.410 
is what I'm trying to figure out right
now

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
now

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.949 
now
but<00:02:15.650> for<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.799> rest<00:02:16.980> of<00:02:17.220> everything<00:02:17.670> else

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
but for the rest of everything else

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.050 
but for the rest of everything else
there<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:19.079> this<00:02:19.379> as<00:02:19.650> well<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.220> I'm<00:02:20.909> just

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
trying to figure out as to whether you

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.440 
trying to figure out as to whether you
guys<00:02:22.379> want<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.829> see<00:02:23.069> this<00:02:24.000> kind<00:02:24.329> or<00:02:24.950> this<00:02:25.950> kind
