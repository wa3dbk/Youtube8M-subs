00:00:01.119 --> 00:00:06.689
 roll out into gear if you look far ahead the holiday fair 

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:11.089
 very often the train driver does this by simply releasing gas and the 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.280
 motor corp out pelts the country to come out 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.640
 in the gear on the top 100 let the car brake on the boat 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.500
 carefully start the engine at that time without fuel 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.229
 for the recovery the company stands at a idle speed a fire on it 

00:00:25.229 --> 00:00:28.819
 oil platform is not remote in this way has the engine 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.429
 no fuel consumed during braking makes connoisseurs happy 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.510
 the 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.310
 the new driving and the cornering after the new driving 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.250
 has nothing to do with power supplied by the local absolutely not like you 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.440
 in built-up areas it is often in third gear 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.830
 that is something that we always saw by making three nowadays often already 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.300
 it is very easy or as in zeist 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.440
 try a test drive and experience the car with a vending machine 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.070
 that the machine only switches in 2012, we just have to go through the city and 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.630
 race now if on with the automatic mode you can let that run a bit 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.620
 you have your desired speed remains that switch now as smoothly as I can 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.790
 the capital sanaa it is just like the rotunda for talent the third position 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.670
 takes it so much easier smoother you save 5 to 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.670
 10 percent fuel when driving in built-up areas 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.550
 it is global and keep a distance if all those players are the first to do that 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.880
 does it mean that we drive together little 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.230
 moment in which we do not know what is going to happen around us in short what 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.270
 anticipatory driving 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.400
 You should always have competition class 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.190
 the three for the last three behind from the borinage I am too heavy central park 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.150
 in which the traffic is constantly monitored by jan greve and 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.580
 controlled in terms of distance many people had too little distance 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.900
 It is often the cause of tail-tail collision 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.600
 all would say let's examine what for the aldermen 60 meters away 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.060
 your predecessor will shorten the number of kilometers that the people 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.720
 predecessor and that is safer than you may want to anticipate driving the gas in time 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.360
 letting go 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.710
 switch back now only if you have built the space around you here is the 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.710
 saving actually achieved optimum roads 

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:30.939
 The correct tire pressure is of the utmost importance when using the 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.449
 the car applying the new driving regularly check the tire pressure 

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:37.899
 what the tire pressure for the lotus can be found in the tent on at 

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:41.449
 On the Feyenoord premise of this car the city is important to us 

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:44.159
 tire for the design and construction of it can be that means the car 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.789
 has driven less than three kilometers 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:48.069
 to come to an optimal rest 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.489
 A tip for applying power to the car fails so few rows 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:55.669
 possible with open windows even on the be saved by the car 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.999
 when you get into the car when you get in the hot car it is better than expected 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:03.429
 make the outside temperature equal to the inside temperature as quickly as possible 

00:03:03.429 --> 00:03:06.149
 but due to the air conditioning to work less hard 

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:08.879
 by the way, those jerks coming up all day as the desired temperature 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.350
 You can safely switch off 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.600
 That saves you 8 to 10 percent more demand 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.400
 also the rear window heating is an emission use that is certainly 50,000 extra 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.349
 fuel costs 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.499
 the time that the weight of the car matters that you don't need in the car 

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.550
 extra weight and tool cabinets look forward to that 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:29.450
 all those from the car are used every ten kilos of extra weight as you have heard 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.719
 for unloading 

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.719
 in ten liters per 100 kilometers 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:42.019
 6 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:45.459
 using the cruise control when new driving you can use a lot of fuel 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:46.130
 save 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:49.150
 by making frequent use of it for cruise control and not just on it 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.450
 the Postelmans motorway actually always do but I am in the built-up area 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.590
 you can also make the best use of google i think everything is bumpy 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.150
 although what goes by car it is a hit on the right foot 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.510
 the road the gas pedal that his sixes use at other than last year or 

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:08.430
 maybe it will enable the rest of the money to use well 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:12.659
 the highest gear there are people who switch to 5 to 6 on the 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:13.719
 motorway 

00:04:13.719 --> 00:04:16.629
 but on 80 km roads and outside built-up areas I know that of course 

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:19.629
 just an application 

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:27.669
 the 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.849
 what the extra fuel costs to get the car of the couple was a driver 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:32.940
 is it a fun sport 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.050
 on roundabouts 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.770
 to try such anticipatory driving is a dutch roundabout can take that 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.180
 means you without waiting 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.180
 be able to drive immediately over the roundabout 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:46.990
 do not forget to indicate that in a timely and clear direction 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.970
 prevents other road users from having to wait for you and then we stop 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.099
 get some extra fuel costs
