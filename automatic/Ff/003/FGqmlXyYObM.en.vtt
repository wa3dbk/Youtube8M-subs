okay<00:00:05.830> this<00:00:06.040> lesson<00:00:06.430> is<00:00:06.609> how<00:00:06.760> to<00:00:06.790> play<00:00:07.029> notation

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
okay this lesson is how to play notation

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.150 
okay this lesson is how to play notation
library<00:00:07.930> number<00:00:08.170> 24

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.160 
library number 24

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.120 
library number 24
it's<00:00:09.309> 2/4<00:00:09.940> and<00:00:10.900> it's<00:00:11.170> also<00:00:11.380> a<00:00:11.560> song<00:00:11.800> called

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.130 
it's 2/4 and it's also a song called

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.019 
it's 2/4 and it's also a song called
Jesus<00:00:12.640> loves<00:00:12.970> me<00:00:13.090> and<00:00:13.920> it's<00:00:14.920> in<00:00:15.220> 2/4<00:00:15.820> time

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:16.029 
Jesus loves me and it's in 2/4 time

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:18.420 
Jesus loves me and it's in 2/4 time
which<00:00:16.330> means<00:00:16.630> there's<00:00:17.500> two<00:00:17.740> beats<00:00:18.160> per

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
which means there's two beats per

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.700 
which means there's two beats per
measure<00:00:18.599> quarter<00:00:19.599> note<00:00:19.749> gets<00:00:19.779> one<00:00:20.050> beat<00:00:20.259> and

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
measure quarter note gets one beat and

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.939 
measure quarter note gets one beat and
it's<00:00:21.579> also<00:00:21.789> in<00:00:22.150> the<00:00:22.240> key<00:00:22.480> of<00:00:22.509> F<00:00:22.869> so<00:00:23.439> there's<00:00:23.650> one

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
it's also in the key of F so there's one

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.439 
it's also in the key of F so there's one
flat<00:00:24.339> that's<00:00:24.730> a<00:00:24.909> b-flat<00:00:25.300> so<00:00:25.829> normally<00:00:26.829> a<00:00:27.429> B<00:00:28.119> is

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:28.449 
flat that's a b-flat so normally a B is

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.050 
flat that's a b-flat so normally a B is
you<00:00:29.199> can<00:00:29.319> put<00:00:29.499> it<00:00:29.560> down<00:00:29.739> here<00:00:30.009> I'm<00:00:30.730> all<00:00:30.939> I'm

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
you can put it down here I'm all I'm

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.300 
you can put it down here I'm all I'm
going<00:00:31.179> to<00:00:31.269> have<00:00:31.710> you<00:00:32.710> can<00:00:32.800> see<00:00:32.860> it<00:00:33.160> right<00:00:33.250> there

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:33.310 
going to have you can see it right there

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.430 
going to have you can see it right there
yeah<00:00:33.610> when<00:00:34.480> I<00:00:34.510> hold<00:00:34.720> the<00:00:34.870> flute

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:35.440 
yeah when I hold the flute

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.939 
yeah when I hold the flute
my<00:00:36.100> my<00:00:36.670> my<00:00:37.090> B<00:00:37.420> note<00:00:37.629> is<00:00:37.840> just<00:00:37.989> the<00:00:38.230> first<00:00:38.680> finger

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
my my my B note is just the first finger

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:41.189 
my my my B note is just the first finger
down<00:00:39.219> and<00:00:39.640> then<00:00:40.000> the<00:00:40.120> thumb<00:00:40.420> down<00:00:40.660> which<00:00:41.019> is

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
down and then the thumb down which is

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.470 
down and then the thumb down which is
right<00:00:41.530> below<00:00:41.739> here<00:00:42.129> you<00:00:42.190> see<00:00:42.519> the<00:00:42.640> thumb<00:00:42.910> now

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
right below here you see the thumb now

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:45.410 
right below here you see the thumb now
when<00:00:43.629> you<00:00:43.690> play<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:43.989> b-flat<00:00:44.469> you<00:00:44.769> can<00:00:44.949> either

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
when you play it b-flat you can either

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.200 
when you play it b-flat you can either
play<00:00:46.420> the<00:00:46.449> B<00:00:46.899> flat<00:00:47.079> key<00:00:47.500> right<00:00:47.920> here<00:00:48.030> or<00:00:49.030> you

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
play the B flat key right here or you

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.029 
play the B flat key right here or you
play<00:00:49.359> the<00:00:49.510> normal<00:00:49.719> beat<00:00:50.109> key<00:00:50.350> and<00:00:50.620> I<00:00:50.769> you<00:00:50.829> can

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
play the normal beat key and I you can

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.819 
play the normal beat key and I you can
use<00:00:51.219> the<00:00:51.399> F<00:00:51.579> key<00:00:51.879> down<00:00:52.089> and<00:00:52.500> since<00:00:53.500> this<00:00:53.649> is<00:00:53.800> a

00:00:53.819 --> 00:00:53.829 
use the F key down and since this is a

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:56.009 
use the F key down and since this is a
pretty<00:00:54.010> simple<00:00:54.309> piece<00:00:54.730> I'll<00:00:55.449> probably<00:00:55.660> end<00:00:55.899> up

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
pretty simple piece I'll probably end up

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:59.130 
pretty simple piece I'll probably end up
using<00:00:56.079> just<00:00:56.530> the<00:00:56.710> B<00:00:56.859> flat<00:00:57.010> key<00:00:57.399> like<00:00:57.699> this<00:00:58.140> okay

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
using just the B flat key like this okay

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.250 
using just the B flat key like this okay
and<00:00:59.440> I'm<00:00:59.800> gonna<00:00:59.920> take<00:01:00.219> it<00:01:00.370> at<00:01:00.460> a<00:01:00.489> tempo<00:01:00.940> like<00:01:01.859> -

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
and I'm gonna take it at a tempo like -

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.480 
and I'm gonna take it at a tempo like -
so<00:01:05.260> you're<00:01:05.409> and<00:01:05.710> it<00:01:05.860> has<00:01:06.010> a<00:01:06.040> lot<00:01:06.220> of<00:01:06.250> eighth

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
so you're and it has a lot of eighth

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.960 
so you're and it has a lot of eighth
notes<00:01:06.520> in<00:01:07.000> it<00:01:07.180> so<00:01:08.170> let's<00:01:08.860> see<00:01:09.100> we're<00:01:09.760> going<00:01:09.880> to

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
notes in it so let's see we're going to

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.179 
notes in it so let's see we're going to
take<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.240> one<00:01:10.630> and<00:01:10.990> two<00:01:11.500> one<00:01:12.340> and<00:01:12.400> two

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
take it one and two one and two

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.550 
take it one and two one and two
and<00:01:14.399> to<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.780> there's<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.049> measure<00:01:16.229> to<00:01:16.469> be

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
and to and there's a measure to be

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.700 
and to and there's a measure to be
careful<00:01:17.009> about<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.549> in<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:18.200> let's<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.380> four

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
careful about it's in the let's see four

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.550 
careful about it's in the let's see four
eight<00:01:20.100> nine<00:01:20.579> the<00:01:21.329> tenth<00:01:21.600> measure<00:01:21.899> has<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
eight nine the tenth measure has a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.520 
eight nine the tenth measure has a
dotted<00:01:23.069> eighth<00:01:23.219> followed<00:01:23.640> by<00:01:23.789> a<00:01:23.819> dotted

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
dotted eighth followed by a dotted

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:33.130 
dotted eighth followed by a dotted
quarter<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.979> you're<00:01:26.100> gonna<00:01:26.189> count<00:01:26.460> that<00:01:31.640> and

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
quarter so you're gonna count that and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.080 
quarter so you're gonna count that and
this<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.349> there's<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.649> same<00:01:34.890> pattern<00:01:35.399> down

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
this is there's a same pattern down

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.309 
this is there's a same pattern down
below<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.719> the<00:01:36.810> third<00:01:37.079> to<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.259> last

00:01:37.309 --> 00:01:37.319 
below and the third to the last

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:40.130 
below and the third to the last
measurement<00:01:37.920> same<00:01:38.250> thing<00:01:38.659> so<00:01:39.659> here<00:01:39.899> we<00:01:39.990> go

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
measurement same thing so here we go

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.139 
measurement same thing so here we go
we're<00:01:40.439> going<00:01:40.469> to<00:01:40.619> take<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.859> at<00:01:41.009> one<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.579> two

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:42.149 
we're going to take it at one and two

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.229 
we're going to take it at one and two
and<00:01:42.509> three<00:01:42.750> four<00:01:43.670> one<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:44.909> two<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.810> ready
