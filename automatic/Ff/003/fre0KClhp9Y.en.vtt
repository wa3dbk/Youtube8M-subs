00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.729 
works perfectly by the way I went and
got<00:04:17.459> the<00:04:17.730> iphone<00:04:18.600> bumper<00:04:18.870> I<00:04:19.049> think<00:04:19.320> it's<00:04:19.440> very

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
got the iphone bumper I think it's very

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.150 
got the iphone bumper I think it's very
overpriced<00:04:20.510> I<00:04:21.650> feel<00:04:22.650> like<00:04:22.770> it's<00:04:22.950> a<00:04:23.040> little

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
overpriced I feel like it's a little

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.790 
overpriced I feel like it's a little
flimsy<00:04:24.080> especially<00:04:25.080> when<00:04:25.229> you<00:04:25.320> put<00:04:25.470> it<00:04:25.560> on<00:04:25.650> the

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
flimsy especially when you put it on the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.190 
flimsy especially when you put it on the
phone<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.220> can<00:04:26.400> tell<00:04:26.669> that<00:04:26.700> it<00:04:27.030> does<00:04:27.210> it<00:04:27.390> it's

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
phone you can tell that it does it it's

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.960 
phone you can tell that it does it it's
not<00:04:28.440> snug<00:04:28.860> up<00:04:29.040> against<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.520> phone<00:04:29.700> that<00:04:29.940> I

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970 
not snug up against the phone that I

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:30.710 
not snug up against the phone that I
would<00:04:30.210> as

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
would as

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.170 
would as
I<00:04:30.750> would<00:04:30.960> like<00:04:31.110> it<00:04:31.350> but<00:04:32.130> when<00:04:32.610> you<00:04:32.700> do<00:04:32.850> put<00:04:33.030> the

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
I would like it but when you do put the

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:43.570 
I would like it but when you do put the
bumper<00:04:33.330> on<00:04:40.130> and<00:04:41.130> you<00:04:41.250> put<00:04:41.490> it<00:04:41.610> over<00:04:41.880> an

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
bumper on and you put it over an

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.540 
bumper on and you put it over an
installation<00:04:44.580> of<00:04:46.880> the<00:04:47.880> invisible<00:04:48.150> shield

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
installation of the invisible shield

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:54.610 
installation of the invisible shield
