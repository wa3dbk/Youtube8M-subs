00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.519
 Welcome to a new gta video 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.530
 online I'm going to bring you another piece 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.900
 a piece another saucepan today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.370
 how to get on the street and so be able 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.680
 steal and stay after or even 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.720
 give a friend some luxury cars in 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.039
 concrete is going to be a piece of adele 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.080
 like the one I carry and good holds a 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.660
 machine the map where where is the spam 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.470
 or exactly let's mark it 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.970
 exactly on the street where 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.769
 appear to be able to go quietly 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.300
 good quietly not because with him the 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.219
 act of making you say that we have and 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.489
 let's get calm there's no 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.600
 nothing good I tell you that the trick though 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.760
 there are people who say that it has seemed 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.100
 leading or driving to another one 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.379
 vehicle the truth is that I have not 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.820
 got and only he gets me out when 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.320
 when I'm driving one of the already 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.550
 only spawn ea in the place that you 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.230
 I'm going to say now it's only united 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.789
 when I drive once but good what 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.000
 that you have to do simply that 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.980
 leave you a der as good or that other 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.500
 Do the trick and leave the car in 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.090
 As spawn and found the area good 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.340
 that appears is right after this 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.890
 statue of this horse is going to look like 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.750
 where are we going to park the car the 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.500
 first part of the trick is 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.890
 cars leave him and well this is the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.750
 greeting people 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.130
 of ader I'm just going to steal and you're not going to 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.140
 can not see the good what is there 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.760
 do is start and exit on the right 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.640
 put out myself and count three traffic lights 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.220
 this would be the first the second and now 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.920
 the third and slow down and move on to the other 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.050
 street by this pedestrian crossing and good 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.520
 we will have forced the prime now the 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.510
 The first one is for a first responder 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.540
 cars from the area that we have 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.070
 parked how many times it takes to leave 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.050
 many times the first one has come in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.430
 this case I do not get the first one so 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.000
 let's go to the next area 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.530
 respawn that is going up the slope I 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.170
 it seems that it is at the third crossing the 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.660
 first second and the next that 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.890
 there is a signal to signal at the junction of me 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.410
 it seems that something like that is sold 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.530
 from rebates or from sold or we give the 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:02:01.170
 back and in the second spawn has already been 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.539
 due to produce and there will be new cars 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.550
 in the area that I park as 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.410
 I say when the car once appears 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.090
 that has not appeared we are going to make a 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.380
 once more when the car appears 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.540
 because we have staying 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.680
 we can make a partner who is 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.540
 with us in the room 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.810
 in this case we do not have a room to 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.579
 that you see that not in that car there then 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.069
 I left it and put it in his garage and 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.390
 as I will say in another video video that 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.879
 I will leave in the description that I am going 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.170
 to upload today in description and what 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.530
 I will surely put in an annotation 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.019
 also here and so you can save us 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.060
 we keep this piece of air that ends 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.760

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.709

00:02:42.389 --> 00:02:45.150
 joy because we have not found a 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:46.829
 time as I say you can stay 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.540

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.950

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.590

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.099
