here<00:04:03.920> I<00:04:04.100> think<00:04:04.460> I<00:04:04.670> don't<00:04:04.850> know<00:04:04.970> how<00:04:05.090> to<00:04:05.150> pause

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:05.330 
here I think I don't know how to pause

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:08.220 
here I think I don't know how to pause
it<00:04:05.510> actually<00:04:05.810> so<00:04:05.960> I'll<00:04:06.050> just<00:04:06.200> keep<00:04:06.350> going<00:04:06.500> and

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.230 
it actually so I'll just keep going and

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.680 

assuming<00:05:08.729> that<00:05:08.789> you<00:05:08.970> got<00:05:09.150> a<00:05:09.180> good<00:05:09.360> few<00:05:09.599> of

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:09.690 
assuming that you got a good few of

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:17.719 
assuming that you got a good few of
those<00:05:09.780> wheels<00:05:11.030> to<00:05:12.030> fancy<00:05:12.449> that<00:05:16.460> the<00:05:17.460> only

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
those wheels to fancy that the only

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:19.879 
those wheels to fancy that the only
thing<00:05:17.940> is<00:05:18.090> that<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.530> powder<00:05:19.530> coating

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
thing is that the powder coating

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.909 
thing is that the powder coating
delaminated<00:05:20.580> off<00:05:20.699> the<00:05:20.909> intake<00:05:21.800> when<00:05:22.800> they

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 
delaminated off the intake when they

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:27.950 
delaminated off the intake when they
rebuilt<00:05:23.250> it<00:05:23.460> mm-hmm<00:05:25.400> and<00:05:26.400> otherwise<00:05:26.960> we've

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
rebuilt it mm-hmm and otherwise we've

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.059 
rebuilt it mm-hmm and otherwise we've
done<00:05:28.110> a<00:05:28.139> pretty<00:05:28.259> decent<00:05:28.680> job<00:05:28.710> of<00:05:28.860> looking

00:05:29.059 --> 00:05:29.069 
done a pretty decent job of looking

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:30.320 
done a pretty decent job of looking
after<00:05:29.310> it<00:05:29.610> this<00:05:29.759> thing<00:05:29.970> gets<00:05:30.150> more

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:30.330 
after it this thing gets more

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.909 
after it this thing gets more
maintenance

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:30.919 
maintenance

00:05:30.919 --> 00:05:34.189 
maintenance
then<00:05:31.919> it<00:05:32.039> gets<00:05:32.159> driven<00:05:32.430> I<00:05:32.669> think<00:05:32.940> autos<00:05:33.870> making

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
then it gets driven I think autos making

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.800 
then it gets driven I think autos making
