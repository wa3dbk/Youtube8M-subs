00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:06.850
 one of the welcome to my routine 

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:09.640
 daily in the morning for care 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.590
 facial of mixed skin to thank we go 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.020
 to start 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.209
 The first thing I do is put a little bit of 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:19.060
 micellar water in a cotton disk and 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:22.810
 pass it all over my face to remove 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:24.849
 any trace of oily dirt or 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.030
 excess of products left over from 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:30.820
 the night before as the next step 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.830
 applied a tonic of preference that is 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.230
 alcohol free because my skin is 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:37.629
 too sensitive I'm currently 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.510
 using this brand of bars already 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.360
 I like it a lot because it's special 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.489
 for combination to oily skin and I feel that 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.890
 it cleans my face very well leaves it with 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:51.120
 a feeling of freshness and helps me 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.649
 control the fat but it will always dry 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.930
 As a next step I apply my cream 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.879

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:01.780

 very hydrated very calm if it is that 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:17.620
 It has redness but at the same time it will help 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.750
 to control the production of fat 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:22.900

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.630
