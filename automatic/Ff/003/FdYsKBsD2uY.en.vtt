they are just simply worn out I took it

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.769 
they are just simply worn out I took it
apart<00:00:28.640> you<00:00:29.640> know<00:00:29.760> there<00:00:29.970> was<00:00:30.090> some<00:00:30.240> dust<00:00:30.449> in<00:00:30.630> it

apart you know there was some dust in it

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.260 
apart you know there was some dust in it
but<00:00:31.260> nothing<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.130> would<00:00:32.399> inhibit<00:00:32.880> it<00:00:33.090> from

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
but nothing that would inhibit it from

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.540 
but nothing that would inhibit it from
working<00:00:33.590> blew<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.680> out<00:00:34.770> real<00:00:34.980> good<00:00:35.160> put<00:00:35.399> it<00:00:35.489> all

working blew it out real good put it all
back<00:00:35.670> together<00:00:35.850> doesn't<00:00:36.300> work<00:00:36.420> so<00:00:36.840> I<00:00:37.290> guess

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129
