00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:20.400

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.769

 we're back here with gta5 for more 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.480
 a tuning of the ones you give 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.120
 great feedback and I'm enjoying it so much 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.070
 to make these pictures as much as you 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.480
 They are enjoying watching 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.149
 Either hit here on the pole. 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.520
 okay we will continue to us it there 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:50.489
 costs of the center that it is better to 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.949
 saints in my opinion not because 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.140
 something changes then in that spear 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.739
 but I think it 's cooler, prettier 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.559
 and more reliable if I were a person 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.870
 real in the game 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.390

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:18.150
 venom and lamborghini do not remember now 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:21.150

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.680
 and with the nobles 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:31.680
 we're getting here in the light before 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:34.439
 Good here, man, get on the saints here. 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.909
 We'll take the car and get passwords in 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.909
 super lathe 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:46.119
 hum size advice here we will give a 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:51.909
 Look at the shields, okay? 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:53.740
 100% review here brakes here blade with 

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.580
 the main name is a secondary thing 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.080
 to deepen is to get more style here 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.039
 return the engine level 4 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.220
 Let's take a look at this 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.220
 equipment 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:12.580
 I like this dual exhaust will 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:15.280
 on the plain hood with the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:15.970
 original a price with the track that is 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.170
 cool 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:25.269
 however the xenon headlights paint 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:28.810
 Let's see here the suitcase does not look like 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:32.830
 brushed aluminum here in secondary color 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:35.920
 I'm going to put a frosted blue 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.920
 Let's take a look and that's cool to 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.260
 Holy shit, no more blue. 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.390
 clearer not only have these streets even 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:53.109
 so let's see a lighter blue here 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:58.320
 in classic colors blue blue other 

00:02:53.109 --> 00:03:00.660
 cool here if blue another time 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:06.280
 skirts 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:07.840
 Excuse me, it's just the street skirts of 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.710
 according to the secondary nor to stay 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:13.600
 cool 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:17.170
 a time spoiler to appear here right? 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:24.090
 ong out to hell 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:27.430
 race is not the wheel of the environment 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.580
 Let me see the sanctuary gets nice with 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.380
 his original wheel is very 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.740
 weird 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.430
 Let's put this wheel here just to bounce. 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:46.090
 a color similar to blue paint 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:48.810
 bright real blue but the baby so 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.730
 bright here will go back to the wheels 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:56.920
 Let's take a look here now to see. 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:59.590
 which wheel is no coolest me 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:02.850
 drew attention so far, so the 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.850
 the sports wheels here 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:18.160
 not only does wheel come in bad government is 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:20.260
 this is every order of the day to put this 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.960
 right there year 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:27.040
 custom tires and tires proof 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:29.889
 Peace with this one for a smoke 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.830
 colorful or blue for all to stay 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:35.560
 the plate in blue 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:40.200
 the car was fine just the weather 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:43.180
 Here 's the night, let's change for the day. 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.270
 there by day, who is a marvel of a 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:49.240
 weather in the morning that car with beautiful to 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:51.370
 sun was very late 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.870
 I know that there is not only here but I already gave 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:55.780
 one step with him 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.880
 so he was on time 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:01.060
 So let's go do something nice. 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:03.580
 to the end of the video and already talking guys 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:06.580
 You want me to do it at the end of 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.729
 videos involving a car or a 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:11.500
 something cool so to do is you 

00:05:09.729 --> 00:05:14.650
 Leave the comments there that I go 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:16.600
 try to do as many things as you can 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.520
 You ask for beauty. 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:24.160
 so let's do something nice and 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:26.890
 end of the video have been back the pro staff 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:29.110
 son this video here, man, I'll try 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.430
 to hit the environment in here 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.320
 water 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.190
 it does not have much to do with the car is not 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:38.830
 a cool thing so, but I think the 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:42.430
 time to do this I know that when I can 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.440
 go on the offline doing it so let's go 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.450
 try to find a pool that is not so 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.860
 small because otherwise the car will fit 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:53.830
 inside right 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:56.539
 Let's play it here, but I'll play from here. 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.610
 Let's see if we hit them. 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.479
 they hit one of these three pools 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:04.669
 sake 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:06.439
 I played the old dwarf hand on or fell 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:08.830
 on the side there 

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:12.099
 Can I get people to carve people? 

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.099
 try again 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:20.539
 Let me see if I can get the 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:22.189
 surrounding housing 

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:25.090
 I think it will not work if not 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:28.360
 helicopter will explode but I will try 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:28.360
 the maximum 

00:06:28.819 --> 00:06:37.520
 good will not go so I'll try me 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:44.419
 play the helicopter and hit the pool 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:50.500
 so lets try to get a good time 

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:50.500
 here but it will not 

00:06:51.100 --> 00:07:00.430
 well worth it here was the dry pool even boy 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:07:04.480
