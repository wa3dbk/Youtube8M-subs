00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.100
 what's up with kids here in general and you 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.779
 I bring a trick to the call of duty 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.820
 black ops 2 for the zombie mode in the 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.100
 bourget map and it's a trick next to 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.240
 curry by as you have seen and it is a new 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.860
 method to get the trap up and 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.720
 to be able to make new tricks 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:33.180
 trap elevated since it was all 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.340
 previous methods are passed up 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.620
 today it seems worth for this new 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.440
 method we're going to need the paralyzer 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.810
 to free the giant and alcohol 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.370
 in this case it fixes that we leave it 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.540
 glued to the wall we give him alcohol and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.610
 running we go to the corner and 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.640
 we shoot with him paralyzer so that 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.829
 before it slows down go go and go more 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.300
 slow then when we corner a 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.980
 wall what we have to do is jump 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.140
 and place the trap in the air and 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.760
 so we will get that the trap is 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.200
 in the air it after 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.329
 patches and updates that had 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.070
 since it no longer worked in any 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.170
 of the above methods to raise the 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.570
 trap then this is the new method worth 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.630
 I give you a brief summary is simply 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.000
 catch the giant give him alcohol and when 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.300
 run towards us that we 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.980
 we have to do is corner us post 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.890
 and as he starts to run towards 

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.240
 what we have to do is 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.700
 start shooting him so that he 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.220
 slow down to fix and then what 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.710
 make us corner but it will not kill us 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.930
 because it usually killed us 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.060
 well with alcohol then by encouraging 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.830
 slow down with the paralyzer 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.780
 we're going to make sure that he does not get cornered and 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.020
 when jumping and placing the trap will stay 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.640
 It is high or is a new method for 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.740
 raise the trap after all the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.600
 patches we have done in this 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.940
 trick that was patched is at fault 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.530
 of the trap patch but with this 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.660
 new method to notice that we have returned it 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.570
 to get to the war and I left your 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.789
 face in the description and that trick already 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.619
 you know you can paint the weapon that 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.979
 you want then you have ammunition 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.660
 infinite in this case from the n-ii from 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.820
 here you can take bonuses without 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.899
 kill the zombies very easily so 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.910
 that nothing I hope you liked this 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.560
 new method you deis life favorites
