kind of being top-heavy it kind of puts

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:54.039 
kind of being top-heavy it kind of puts
more<00:00:49.110> weight<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.400> front<00:00:50.820> of<00:00:51.089> the<00:00:51.449> Hat<00:00:52.280> and

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
Canon this is one of the downfalls and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.310 
Canon this is one of the downfalls and
another<00:01:07.260> thing<00:01:08.450> that<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.479> didn't<00:01:09.960> really<00:01:10.170> like

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
another thing that I didn't really like

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.320 
another thing that I didn't really like
about<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> is<00:01:11.159> it's<00:01:11.640> got<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.090> USB<00:01:14.000> plug<00:01:15.000> here

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
about it is it's got this USB plug here

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.860 
about it is it's got this USB plug here
that<00:01:15.540> comes<00:01:15.780> out<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.170> bottom<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.570> it's<00:01:18.570> kind

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:18.870 
that comes out the bottom so it's kind

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.430 
that comes out the bottom so it's kind
of<00:01:18.960> in<00:01:19.050> the<00:01:19.110> way<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.560> putting<00:01:20.550> it<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.970> Hat

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
but at least it's it stays out of the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.290 
but at least it's it stays out of the
way

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300

and for some reason here all of a sudden
the<00:01:59.490> camera<00:02:00.030> will<00:02:00.180> turn<00:02:00.450> itself<00:02:00.870> on<00:02:01.940> why<00:02:02.940> I

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:02.970 
the camera will turn itself on why I

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.719 
the camera will turn itself on why I
don't<00:02:03.480> know<00:02:03.630> so<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.560> got<00:02:04.800> to<00:02:04.920> keep<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.280> battery

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729

out<00:02:05.760> of<00:02:05.880> it<00:02:06.560> just<00:02:07.560> so<00:02:07.740> it<00:02:07.830> don't<00:02:07.979> drain<00:02:08.310> itself

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
out of it just so it don't drain itself

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:14.540 
out of it just so it don't drain itself
and<00:02:12.019> it<00:02:13.019> don't<00:02:13.290> be<00:02:13.769> as<00:02:13.860> far<00:02:14.099> as<00:02:14.220> they<00:02:14.310> know<00:02:14.519> it

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
and it don't be as far as they know it

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.199 
and it don't be as far as they know it
don't<00:02:15.000> take<00:02:15.269> pictures<00:02:15.540> it's<00:02:16.200> just<00:02:16.409> videos<00:02:17.209> so

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
don't take pictures it's just videos so

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.239 
don't take pictures it's just videos so
you'll<00:02:18.599> have<00:02:18.689> to<00:02:18.840> do<00:02:18.989> a<00:02:19.019> screen<00:02:19.560> capture<00:02:19.590> from

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:20.249 
you'll have to do a screen capture from

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:21.770 
you'll have to do a screen capture from
a<00:02:20.639> video<00:02:21.060> that<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.389> make

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
a video that you make

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.449 
a video that you make
you<00:02:21.840> want<00:02:22.020> to<00:02:22.110> get<00:02:22.200> any<00:02:22.319> pictures<00:02:22.830> out<00:02:23.190> of<00:02:23.220> it

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
you want to get any pictures out of it

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.280 
you want to get any pictures out of it
but<00:02:24.090> the<00:02:24.209> picture<00:02:24.569> is<00:02:24.750> clear<00:02:25.760> so<00:02:27.050> that's<00:02:28.050> all<00:02:28.260> I

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
but the picture is clear so that's all I

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.530 
but the picture is clear so that's all I
got<00:02:28.560> to<00:02:28.709> see<00:02:28.920> about<00:02:29.190> it<00:02:29.250> I'm<00:02:29.819> not<00:02:29.880> using<00:02:30.330> it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
got to see about it I'm not using it

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.380 
got to see about it I'm not using it
anymore<00:02:30.630> because<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.650> audio<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.340> the<00:02:33.180> main

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
anymore because of the audio is the main

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.620 
anymore because of the audio is the main
reason<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:34.230> the<00:02:34.470> fact<00:02:34.740> that<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.940> turns<00:02:36.270> itself

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
reason and the fact that it turns itself

a 3400 HD both these cameras are high

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.210 
a 3400 HD both these cameras are high
definition<00:03:06.290> 740<00:03:08.269> they're<00:03:09.269> not<00:03:09.420> the<00:03:09.600> 1080<00:03:10.220> but

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
definition 740 they're not the 1080 but

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.330 
definition 740 they're not the 1080 but
I<00:03:11.720> both<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:13.019> them<00:03:13.200> adjusted<00:03:13.800> for<00:03:14.220> this

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
I both have them adjusted for this

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.729 
I both have them adjusted for this
review<00:03:14.819> down<00:03:15.150> to<00:03:15.330> 640<00:03:15.959> just<00:03:16.170> to<00:03:16.290> try<00:03:16.440> to<00:03:16.470> save

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:16.739 
review down to 640 just to try to save

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:23.509 
review down to 640 just to try to save
file<00:03:17.040> size<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:18.140> but<00:03:21.590> can<00:03:22.590> was<00:03:22.800> pretty<00:03:23.040> nice<00:03:23.250> I

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
file size so but can was pretty nice I

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:30.289 
file size so but can was pretty nice I
like<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.760> better<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:27.030> screen<00:03:29.299> the

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
like it better and the screen the

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.660 
like it better and the screen the
display<00:03:30.780> is<00:03:30.989> much<00:03:31.200> better<00:03:31.440> I'm<00:03:32.040> bigger<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.549> mean

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
display is much better I'm bigger I mean

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.880 
display is much better I'm bigger I mean
it's<00:03:33.000> it's<00:03:33.390> like<00:03:33.660> twice<00:03:33.930> as<00:03:34.170> big<00:03:34.380> as<00:03:34.530> what<00:03:34.739> the

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
it's it's like twice as big as what the

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.280 
it's it's like twice as big as what the
model<00:03:35.459> is<00:03:36.769> but<00:03:37.850> this<00:03:38.850> one<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.299> a<00:03:39.329> 5<00:03:39.810> power

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
model is but this one is a 5 power

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.600 
model is but this one is a 5 power
optical<00:03:41.010> zoom<00:03:41.209> and<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:43.890> part<00:03:44.220> I<00:03:44.280> don't<00:03:44.340> like

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
optical zoom and that part I don't like

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.900 
optical zoom and that part I don't like
about<00:03:44.820> it<00:03:45.150> because<00:03:45.600> when<00:03:45.959> you<00:03:46.049> zoom<00:03:46.910> it's

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
about it because when you zoom it's

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.390 
about it because when you zoom it's
really<00:03:48.209> pixelated<00:03:48.709> it's<00:03:49.709> not<00:03:49.950> as<00:03:50.100> clear

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
really pixelated it's not as clear

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.930 
really pixelated it's not as clear
anymore<00:03:50.850> I<00:03:52.370> don't<00:03:53.370> know<00:03:53.430> what<00:03:53.579> else<00:03:53.730> to<00:03:53.850> say

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
anymore I don't know what else to say

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.020 
anymore I don't know what else to say
about<00:03:54.269> it<00:03:54.450> there's<00:03:54.750> there's<00:03:55.680> more<00:03:56.070> features

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
about it there's there's more features

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.300 
about it there's there's more features
on<00:03:57.390> this<00:03:57.540> camera<00:03:57.810> as<00:03:58.200> far<00:03:58.410> as<00:03:58.530> adjustments<00:03:59.160> and

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
on this camera as far as adjustments and

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.220 
on this camera as far as adjustments and
stuff<00:03:59.489> go<00:03:59.730> but<00:04:00.650> this<00:04:01.650> one<00:04:01.859> only<00:04:01.980> has<00:04:03.230> boosted

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230 
stuff go but this one only has boosted

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:09.490 
stuff go but this one only has boosted
IC<00:04:05.359> 747<00:04:06.359> 20<00:04:06.660> it<00:04:07.019> was<00:04:07.230> why<00:04:07.410> it<00:04:07.470> was<00:04:07.769> meant<00:04:08.070> to<00:04:08.130> say

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
IC 747 20 it was why it was meant to say

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.009 
IC 747 20 it was why it was meant to say
it's<00:04:10.500> got<00:04:10.769> either<00:04:11.160> that<00:04:11.519> or<00:04:11.760> 640<00:04:12.660> so<00:04:12.840> this

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:13.019 
it's got either that or 640 so this

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:15.110 
it's got either that or 640 so this
one's<00:04:13.230> only<00:04:13.380> got<00:04:13.470> 2<00:04:13.739> adjustments<00:04:14.459> and<00:04:14.700> the

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
one's only got 2 adjustments and the

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.779 
one's only got 2 adjustments and the
bottle<00:04:16.079> I'm<00:04:16.650> taking<00:04:16.979> this<00:04:17.070> video<00:04:17.430> with<00:04:17.609> has

00:04:17.779 --> 00:04:17.789 
bottle I'm taking this video with has

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:22.130 
bottle I'm taking this video with has
got<00:04:18.000> three<00:04:19.010> but<00:04:20.010> at<00:04:20.370> the<00:04:20.519> bottom<00:04:21.019> where<00:04:22.019> you

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
got three but at the bottom where you

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:25.070 
got three but at the bottom where you
hook<00:04:22.350> it<00:04:22.590> up<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.039> cam<00:04:23.430> or<00:04:24.000> the<00:04:24.300> Hat<00:04:24.570> cam<00:04:24.840> is

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
hook it up to the cam or the Hat cam is

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:30.320 
hook it up to the cam or the Hat cam is
on<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.380> bottom<00:04:25.740> so<00:04:26.490> this<00:04:27.240> stays<00:04:28.310> more<00:04:29.330> center

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
on the bottom so this stays more center

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.089 
on the bottom so this stays more center
of<00:04:30.450> gravity<00:04:30.990> instead<00:04:31.289> of<00:04:31.380> up<00:04:31.560> like<00:04:31.800> this<00:04:32.039> like

00:04:32.089 --> 00:04:32.099 
of gravity instead of up like this like

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:33.550 
of gravity instead of up like this like
the<00:04:32.490> vato<00:04:32.729> is

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:33.560 
the vato is

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.280 
the vato is
have<00:04:33.710> it<00:04:33.860> on<00:04:33.980> my<00:04:34.160> hat<00:04:34.400> so<00:04:34.810> even<00:04:35.810> though<00:04:35.930> this<00:04:36.110> is

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
have it on my hat so even though this is

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.740 
have it on my hat so even though this is
a<00:04:36.350> little<00:04:36.470> bit<00:04:36.710> heavier<00:04:37.040> than<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.400> bottle<00:04:37.790> it

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:38.750 
a little bit heavier than the bottle it

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.820 
a little bit heavier than the bottle it
seeped<00:04:39.139> this<00:04:39.380> seat<00:04:40.310> can<00:04:41.230> and<00:04:42.230> seems<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.590> little

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
seeped this seat can and seems a little

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
seeped this seat can and seems a little
more<00:04:43.010> stable<00:04:43.400> on<00:04:43.730> my<00:04:43.880> hat

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
more stable on my hat

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.480 
more stable on my hat
but<00:04:46.850> I<00:04:47.360> had<00:04:47.840> to<00:04:47.960> recharge<00:04:48.350> this<00:04:48.650> battery<00:04:49.070> again

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
but I had to recharge this battery again

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.770 
but I had to recharge this battery again
before<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.270> made<00:04:50.540> this<00:04:50.720> video<00:04:51.460> and<00:04:52.460> I<00:04:53.060> think<00:04:53.690> the

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:53.780 
before I made this video and I think the

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:56.230 
before I made this video and I think the
battery's<00:04:54.230> already<00:04:54.500> gone<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:55.760> only<00:04:55.940> lasts

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
battery's already gone it only lasts

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.930 
battery's already gone it only lasts
like<00:04:56.480> about<00:04:56.780> but<00:04:57.380> doesn't<00:04:57.800> recharges<00:04:58.430> I<00:04:58.550> it

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
like about but doesn't recharges I it

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.530 
like about but doesn't recharges I it
seems<00:04:59.180> like<00:04:59.540> and<00:04:59.810> and<00:05:01.270> probably<00:05:02.270> have<00:05:02.360> to<00:05:02.419> get

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
seems like and and probably have to get

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.690 
seems like and and probably have to get
a<00:05:02.570> new<00:05:02.720> battery<00:05:02.990> but<00:05:03.410> yeah<00:05:04.010> this<00:05:04.250> is<00:05:04.400> a<00:05:04.430> much

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:04.700 
a new battery but yeah this is a much

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.450 
a new battery but yeah this is a much
better<00:05:05.030> by<00:05:05.270> the<00:05:05.630> Canon<00:05:06.080> and<00:05:06.320> you'll<00:05:07.250> probably

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
better by the Canon and you'll probably

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.180 
better by the Canon and you'll probably
notice<00:05:07.820> the<00:05:08.419> audio<00:05:08.630> is<00:05:09.229> much<00:05:09.560> better<00:05:09.800> on<00:05:09.950> the

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.190 
notice the audio is much better on the

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.090 
notice the audio is much better on the
Canon<00:05:10.580> to<00:05:10.880> you<00:05:11.840> you<00:05:12.320> probably<00:05:12.650> had<00:05:12.830> to<00:05:12.950> turn

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
Canon to you you probably had to turn

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.740 
Canon to you you probably had to turn
the<00:05:13.250> volume<00:05:13.400> up<00:05:13.790> to<00:05:14.000> hear<00:05:14.180> this<00:05:14.330> part<00:05:14.600> of<00:05:14.690> the
