hi<00:00:01.319> there<00:00:01.560> I<00:00:01.920> was<00:00:02.280> checking<00:00:02.850> out<00:00:03.090> YouTube<00:00:03.870> and

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
hi there I was checking out YouTube and

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.089 
hi there I was checking out YouTube and
I<00:00:04.650> saw<00:00:05.190> a<00:00:05.400> lot<00:00:05.940> of<00:00:06.410> tutorials<00:00:07.410> how<00:00:07.680> to<00:00:07.710> cool

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
I saw a lot of tutorials how to cool

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.850 
I saw a lot of tutorials how to cool
your<00:00:08.250> MacBook<00:00:08.730> Pro<00:00:09.000> down<00:00:09.269> but<00:00:10.110> also<00:00:10.290> extend

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
your MacBook Pro down but also extend

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.570 
your MacBook Pro down but also extend
your<00:00:10.950> battery<00:00:11.160> life<00:00:11.370> and<00:00:12.139> I<00:00:13.160> thought<00:00:14.160> maybe<00:00:14.400> I

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
your battery life and I thought maybe I

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.849 
your battery life and I thought maybe I
could<00:00:14.730> help<00:00:14.969> with<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.570> little<00:00:15.900> program<00:00:16.350> cause<00:00:16.590> I

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
could help with a little program cause I

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.730 
could help with a little program cause I
couldn't<00:00:17.310> found<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:17.910> program<00:00:18.510> on<00:00:18.740> YouTube

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
couldn't found that program on YouTube

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.960 
couldn't found that program on YouTube
by<00:00:20.430> tutorials<00:00:21.050> so<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.439> called<00:00:23.189> cool<00:00:23.670> book

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
by tutorials so it's called cool book

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.679 
by tutorials so it's called cool book
cool<00:00:24.600> book<00:00:24.869> controller<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:26.119> what<00:00:27.119> it<00:00:27.210> does<00:00:27.420> it

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
cool book controller and what it does it

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.950 
cool book controller and what it does it
you<00:00:28.560> can<00:00:28.730> change<00:00:29.730> your<00:00:29.939> voltage<00:00:30.390> for<00:00:30.779> your

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
you can change your voltage for your

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.299 
you can change your voltage for your
processor<00:00:31.920> and<00:00:32.690> standard<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.010> one<00:00:35.010> point

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
processor and standard it is one point

point six six gigahertz by a MacBook Pro
unibody<00:00:42.000> and<00:00:43.219> I<00:00:45.829> loaded<00:00:46.860> -<00:00:47.160> like<00:00:48.559> 1.05<00:00:49.559> voltage

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
unibody and I loaded - like 1.05 voltage

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.290 
unibody and I loaded - like 1.05 voltage
and<00:00:50.340> that<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:52.250> temperature<00:00:53.250> really<00:00:53.610> big<00:00:53.969> like

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
and that is temperature really big like

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.689 
and that is temperature really big like
10<00:00:54.660> degrees<00:00:55.309> Celsius<00:00:56.309> difference<00:00:57.180> and

10 degrees Celsius difference and

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.279 
10 degrees Celsius difference and
battery<00:00:59.699> life<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.210> should<00:01:00.449> also<00:01:00.660> extend<00:01:01.079> your

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
battery life it should also extend your

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:04.460 
battery life it should also extend your
battery<00:01:01.469> life<00:01:01.829> of<00:01:02.070> course<00:01:02.280> because<00:01:02.789> the<00:01:03.470> CPU

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
battery life of course because the CPU

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.810 
battery life of course because the CPU
needs<00:01:05.129> less<00:01:05.700> power<00:01:06.920> but<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:07.950> check<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.640> you

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
needs less power but to check it you

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.480 
needs less power but to check it you
also<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.659> stress<00:01:10.080> your<00:01:11.570> CPU<00:01:12.710> to<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:14.310> if

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
also have to stress your CPU to see if

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.020 
also have to stress your CPU to see if
it's<00:01:14.670> stable<00:01:14.880> or<00:01:15.180> not<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.250> that's<00:01:17.250> why<00:01:17.490> I<00:01:17.549> have

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
it's stable or not and that's why I have

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.600 
it's stable or not and that's why I have
CPU<00:01:18.540> test<00:01:18.840> it's<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.350> free<00:01:19.590> program<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.369> can

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
CPU test it's a free program you can

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.340 
CPU test it's a free program you can
find<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.939> on<00:01:21.060> the<00:01:21.180> internet<00:01:21.570> search<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.229> in

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
find it on the internet search it in

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.749 
find it on the internet search it in
Google<00:01:23.750> it<00:01:24.750> works<00:01:25.590> really<00:01:25.830> well<00:01:26.100> I<00:01:26.340> did<00:01:26.640> it

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
Google it works really well I did it

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.480 
Google it works really well I did it
yesterday<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.299> two<00:01:28.080> hours<00:01:28.470> three<00:01:28.770> hours<00:01:28.799> and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
yesterday for two hours three hours and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.719 
yesterday for two hours three hours and
then<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:30.450> resulted<00:01:31.049> really<00:01:31.350> good<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:31.829> for<00:01:32.610> now

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
then it resulted really good and for now

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.920 
then it resulted really good and for now
it's<00:01:33.090> stable<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:33.990> don't<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.439> any<00:01:34.590> crashes<00:01:35.930> so

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
it's stable I don't have any crashes so

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.399 
it's stable I don't have any crashes so
this<00:01:36.960> is<00:01:37.380> perfect<00:01:37.860> voltage<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.520> this<00:01:39.409> this

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
this is perfect voltage and this this

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.020 
this is perfect voltage and this this
like<00:01:41.899> 0.1<00:01:42.899> voltage<00:01:43.890> in<00:01:44.159> difference<00:01:45.979> so<00:01:47.030> it

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
like 0.1 voltage in difference so it

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.219 
like 0.1 voltage in difference so it
extends<00:01:48.720> your<00:01:48.780> CPU<00:01:49.470> life<00:01:49.740> your<00:01:50.340> fans<00:01:51.240> in<00:01:51.720> the

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
extends your CPU life your fans in the

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.090 
extends your CPU life your fans in the
laptop<00:01:53.329> those<00:01:54.329> will<00:01:54.600> last<00:01:55.049> longer<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.680> your

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
laptop those will last longer and your

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.289 
laptop those will last longer and your
battery<00:01:56.399> life<00:01:56.640> will<00:01:56.939> be<00:01:57.119> extended<00:01:57.659> -<00:01:58.700> so<00:01:59.700> all

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
battery life will be extended - so all

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:03.870 
battery life will be extended - so all
very<00:02:00.899> positive<00:02:01.850> and

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
very positive and

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.779 
very positive and
for<00:02:04.240> fan<00:02:04.600> control<00:02:05.020> I<00:02:05.259> use<00:02:05.500> the<00:02:06.250> program<00:02:06.610> fan

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:06.789 
for fan control I use the program fan

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.900 
for fan control I use the program fan
control<00:02:07.470> most<00:02:08.470> Mac<00:02:08.770> users<00:02:08.800> already<00:02:09.580> know<00:02:09.759> the

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
control most Mac users already know the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.470 
control most Mac users already know the
program<00:02:10.390> it's<00:02:10.720> really<00:02:11.020> easy<00:02:11.200> you<00:02:11.849> put<00:02:12.849> on<00:02:13.000> a

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
program it's really easy you put on a

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.790 
program it's really easy you put on a
base<00:02:14.170> speed<00:02:14.500> I<00:02:14.769> put<00:02:15.130> on<00:02:15.569> 1900<00:02:16.569> maybe<00:02:16.930> 2000<00:02:17.709> you

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
base speed I put on 1900 maybe 2000 you

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.540 
base speed I put on 1900 maybe 2000 you
can<00:02:17.980> try

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
can try

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.640 
can try
the<00:02:22.380> fans<00:02:23.380> will<00:02:24.220> go<00:02:24.430> up<00:02:24.610> higher<00:02:24.880> from<00:02:25.720> 42

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
the fans will go up higher from 42

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.479 
the fans will go up higher from 42
degrees<00:02:27.010> and<00:02:27.810> then<00:02:28.810> they<00:02:29.200> will<00:02:29.800> go<00:02:30.160> to<00:02:30.220> the

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
degrees and then they will go to the

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.880 
degrees and then they will go to the
highest<00:02:30.730> point<00:02:31.090> 70<00:02:31.660> degrees<00:02:31.989> that<00:02:32.380> that's

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
highest point 70 degrees that that's

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:39.030 
highest point 70 degrees that that's
their<00:02:33.640> fastest<00:02:34.209> point<00:02:34.510> they<00:02:34.870> spin<00:02:35.230> and<00:02:38.040> yeah

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
their fastest point they spin and yeah

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.039 
their fastest point they spin and yeah
that's<00:02:39.370> it<00:02:39.610> you<00:02:39.849> should<00:02:40.090> try<00:02:40.330> those<00:02:40.540> programs

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.049 
that's it you should try those programs

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:43.440 
that's it you should try those programs
this<00:02:41.319> is<00:02:41.799> a<00:02:41.860> full<00:02:42.400> version<00:02:42.610> by<00:02:42.910> the<00:02:42.970> way<00:02:43.150> and

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
this is a full version by the way and

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.000 
this is a full version by the way and
you<00:02:44.349> will<00:02:45.250> not<00:02:45.549> be<00:02:45.819> able<00:02:46.030> to<00:02:46.269> do<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.110> same<00:02:47.410> on<00:02:47.769> a

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
you will not be able to do the same on a

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:54.449 
you will not be able to do the same on a
demo<00:02:48.700> version<00:02:49.830> but<00:02:51.450> our<00:02:52.450> really<00:02:53.459> recommend

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459
