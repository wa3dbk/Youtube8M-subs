00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.320 

well<00:01:08.760> why<00:01:08.970> this<00:01:09.030> video<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.049> blurry<00:01:11.000> but<00:01:14.330> I'm

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
well why this video is so blurry but I'm

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.630 
well why this video is so blurry but I'm
loving<00:01:15.750> my<00:01:15.930> Dungeness<00:01:16.590> crab<00:01:16.830> seems<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.549> be

loving my Dungeness crab seems to be

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.060 
loving my Dungeness crab seems to be
easy<00:01:17.850> enough<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:21.600> don't<00:01:22.200> think<00:01:22.380> I'd<00:01:22.860> be

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
easy enough and I don't think I'd be

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.609 
easy enough and I don't think I'd be
able<00:01:23.220> to<00:01:23.280> keep<00:01:23.430> them<00:01:23.610> for<00:01:23.820> a<00:01:24.119> long<00:01:25.080> time<00:01:25.380> but

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
able to keep them for a long time but

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.850 
able to keep them for a long time but
two<00:01:26.580> three<00:01:26.759> weeks<00:01:27.030> no<00:01:27.299> problem<00:01:27.810> just<00:01:28.470> keep<00:01:28.710> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
two three weeks no problem just keep the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
two three weeks no problem just keep the
water<00:01:29.100> below<00:01:29.540> sixty<00:01:30.540> five<00:01:31.460> right<00:01:32.460> now<00:01:32.670> it's

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
water below sixty five right now it's

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
water below sixty five right now it's
probably<00:01:33.090> about<00:01:33.479> 70<00:01:35.360> about<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.390> ninety<00:01:36.780> degree

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
probably about 70 about a ninety degree

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.039 
probably about 70 about a ninety degree
day<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.320> day<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:40.970> keep<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.119> water<00:01:42.270> cooler

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
day to day and keep the water cooler

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.880 
day to day and keep the water cooler
they<00:01:43.590> probably<00:01:43.890> prefer<00:01:44.159> it<00:01:44.610> if<00:01:44.790> it's<00:01:45.000> about<00:01:45.180> 45

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
they probably prefer it if it's about 45

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.910 
they probably prefer it if it's about 45
