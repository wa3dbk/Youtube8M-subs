00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:04.710
 the gattuso fish in this case that is 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.650
 super healthy economic with a 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:11.580
 romesco sauce that is spectacular and some 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.380
 plants starting with the 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.960
 ingredients that Diego talked about 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.960
 before they start like putting 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:33.270
 debate 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.800
 to see all the ingredients of those that 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.200
 I spoke before one afternoon 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.059
 and that we returned them in aluminum foil and 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.520
 We send it to the medium oven to be 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.620
 cook and go xavier nice is not quiet 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.320
 we have a lot of gas in this 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.720
 sauce that we remember young people who 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.190
 criticized meat especially and that 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.409
 I liked to continue putting the arrival great 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.869
 Cooked Cooked Check that you are a 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.790
 puree of what I am I liked what we 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.030
 said diego before very narrow alec 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.460
 arctic that garlic can be cooked or 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.220
 raw always one has this doubt if not 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.560
 I cook loses everything I do not know in three that 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.000
 he signed here I have two laces 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.539
 blots that we are also going to cook 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.350
 along with the garlic in for him here 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:33.270
 we save the skin 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.160
 obviously the bug seems to be a 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.110
 little bit the stone seeds seems to have 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.789
 a little bit of this I have to have a pan 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.729
 where are we going to put a little bit of oil 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:44.009
 of olive alone the olive oil and 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.720
 please look at olive oil 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.530
 has a characteristic similar to what 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.120
 which would be the 39 and is very similar without 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.380
 However, food was not known 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:57.720
 Pretty is perfect but it has the 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.610
 Navarre good ones and other benefits 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.070
 exactly good let's talk 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.650
 folding the little bread in olive oil 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.120
 the sticks and study that we're going to 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.220
 put some tomatoes there so that 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.830
 kidnap us in the oven 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.570
 let's get the garlic the smudges and some of 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:18.110
 what Diego also spoke is a 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.110
 Delight that they are almonds and hazelnuts 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.890
 together with three we also had the 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:28.590
 arginine that was what you're going to incorporate 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.870
 vitamin c for skin coloring 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.760
 carotenoids for life performance of 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.920
 the option arteries and ticos and omega 3 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.920
 as meaning we also have 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:48.010
 can be accompanied with any path 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.260
 to accompany any constant 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.750
 more or less 12 almonds 12 hazels and 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.550
 it's not so little we peel them 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.959
 almonds the peels submerging them in 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.880
 boiling water for a minute and after 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.709
 remove the skin and hazelnuts when the 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.170
 things you take out of the oven and the fruits 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:04.150
 with a dishtowel plenty of sunshine with which 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.860
 we are peeling them where was the 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.440
 bread to delve into the tomatoes of 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.510
 neurology in a little lunch while I go 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.730
 processing this with that with oil 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.560
 olive a little more if you 're 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:16.480
 caring you can add a little bit of 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.549
 water lie a little bit to add 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.120
 and I'll stay in the water and wine vinegar that 

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.120
 forget me 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.660
 the air came to Ivan I'm going to process this 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.640
 once it is toasted from the bread and that 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.930
 is also cost the tomatito I'm going to 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.390
