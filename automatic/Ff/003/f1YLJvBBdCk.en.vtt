in a quick video to answer some

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.640 
in a quick video to answer some
questions<00:00:11.100> about<00:00:11.900> RC<00:00:12.900> helicopter<00:00:13.410> swash

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
questions about RC helicopter swash

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.220 
questions about RC helicopter swash
plates<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.160> how<00:00:14.280> the<00:00:14.340> system<00:00:14.790> works<00:00:15.080> this<00:00:16.080> is

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
plates and how the system works this is

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.010 
plates and how the system works this is
my<00:00:16.439> king<00:00:17.040> to<00:00:17.310> collective<00:00:18.180> pitch<00:00:18.330> helicopter

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
my king to collective pitch helicopter

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.580 
my king to collective pitch helicopter
and<00:00:19.230> real<00:00:20.220> quick<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:21.779> question<00:00:22.110> was<00:00:22.230> how<00:00:22.560> does

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
and real quick the question was how does

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.410 
and real quick the question was how does
the<00:00:23.070> helicopter<00:00:23.640> move<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.119> head<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.359> the

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the helicopter move and head of the

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.620 
the helicopter move and head of the
blades<00:00:24.690> pitch<00:00:25.020> if<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:26.100> look<00:00:26.430> here<00:00:26.880> this<00:00:27.420> is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
blades pitch if you look here this is

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.450 
blades pitch if you look here this is
the<00:00:27.660> swash<00:00:28.080> plate<00:00:28.320> which<00:00:28.949> was<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> question

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
the swash plate which was the question

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.730 
the swash plate which was the question
this<00:00:30.000> is<00:00:30.180> the<00:00:30.330> main<00:00:30.570> control<00:00:31.140> for<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.500> head

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
this is the main control for the head

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.160 
this is the main control for the head
and<00:00:32.010> what<00:00:32.610> this<00:00:32.760> does<00:00:32.820> is<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:33.330> moves<00:00:33.809> up<00:00:34.019> and

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and what this does is this moves up and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.170 
and what this does is this moves up and
down<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.379> tilts<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.250> gives<00:00:35.879> you<00:00:36.000> two

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
down and tilts and gives you two

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.880 
down and tilts and gives you two
different<00:00:36.510> things<00:00:36.659> that<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.080> does<00:00:37.110> it<00:00:37.680> will

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
different things that it does it will

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.369 
different things that it does it will
pitch<00:00:38.190> the<00:00:38.430> blades<00:00:38.729> and<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.870> will<00:00:39.989> also

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
pitch the blades and it will also

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.219 
pitch the blades and it will also
increase<00:00:40.979> as<00:00:41.280> an<00:00:41.460> RPM<00:00:41.879> increases<00:00:42.420> and<00:00:42.629> then

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:43.229 
increase as an RPM increases and then

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:46.430 
increase as an RPM increases and then
when<00:00:43.610> several<00:00:44.610> of<00:00:44.790> these<00:00:44.879> servos<00:00:45.479> move<00:00:45.839> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
when several of these servos move the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.860 
when several of these servos move the
fly<00:00:46.739> bar<00:00:47.070> moves<00:00:47.400> and<00:00:47.729> that<00:00:47.850> gives<00:00:48.120> forward<00:00:48.750> and

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
fly bar moves and that gives forward and

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.930 
fly bar moves and that gives forward and
back<00:00:49.049> and<00:00:49.320> left<00:00:49.470> and<00:00:49.680> right<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.640> what<00:00:50.820> I'm

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
back and left and right so what I'm

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.289 
back and left and right so what I'm
going<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.150> do<00:00:51.330> here<00:00:51.360> is<00:00:52.320> I'm<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.769> plant

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
going to do here is I'm going to plant

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:57.969 
going to do here is I'm going to plant
my<00:00:54.559> controller<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:56.059> I'm<00:00:57.059> going<00:00:57.269> to<00:00:57.330> do<00:00:57.540> it<00:00:57.659> as

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
my controller and I'm going to do it as

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:01.100 
my controller and I'm going to do it as
pushing<00:00:58.979> the<00:00:59.100> throttle<00:00:59.129> up<00:00:59.699> so<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.570> I<00:01:00.720> push<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
pushing the throttle up so as I push the

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.500 
pushing the throttle up so as I push the
throttle<00:01:01.260> up<00:01:01.710> the<00:01:02.489> three<00:01:02.790> servers<00:01:03.059> in

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
throttle up the three servers in

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.609 
throttle up the three servers in
conjunction<00:01:03.989> move<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:05.220> head<00:01:06.210> moves<00:01:06.510> now<00:01:07.260> if

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
conjunction move and head moves now if

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.730 
conjunction move and head moves now if
you<00:01:07.740> watch<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.280> blade<00:01:08.780> I'm<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:10.200> to<00:01:10.350> bottom

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
you watch the blade I'm down to bottom

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.560 
you watch the blade I'm down to bottom
stick<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.490> I'm<00:01:11.909> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.090> go<00:01:12.180> up<00:01:12.270> to<00:01:12.390> full

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
stick and I'm going to go up to full

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.779 
stick and I'm going to go up to full
stick<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.140> there's<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.920> blade<00:01:14.159> tilting<00:01:14.670> and

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
stick and there's the blade tilting and

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.090 
stick and there's the blade tilting and
that<00:01:14.969> gives<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.329> your<00:01:15.509> list<00:01:15.810> so<00:01:16.619> that's<00:01:16.829> where

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
that gives you your list so that's where

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.249 
that gives you your list so that's where
the<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.880> collective<00:01:18.420> pitch<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.810> this<00:01:18.960> and

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
the the collective pitch in this and

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.649 
the the collective pitch in this and
this<00:01:19.770> works<00:01:20.159> and<00:01:20.640> it's<00:01:21.149> kind<00:01:21.179> of<00:01:21.329> hard<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.509> do

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
this works and it's kind of hard to do

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:24.429 
this works and it's kind of hard to do
with<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:21.960> hand<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.469> if<00:01:22.859> i<00:01:22.979> hold<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.280> fly<00:01:23.579> bar

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:24.439 
with one hand but if i hold the fly bar

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:28.249 
with one hand but if i hold the fly bar
steady<00:01:25.439> and<00:01:25.710> i<00:01:26.520> move<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.060> stick<00:01:27.299> up<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:28.020> see

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
steady and i move the stick up you see

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.980 
steady and i move the stick up you see
both<00:01:28.590> blades<00:01:28.950> move<00:01:29.450> and<00:01:30.450> now<00:01:30.659> they're<00:01:30.869> at

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
both blades move and now they're at

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.349 
both blades move and now they're at
positive<00:01:31.500> pitch<00:01:31.759> so<00:01:32.759> that's<00:01:32.969> how<00:01:33.149> this

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:33.359 
positive pitch so that's how this

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:36.349 
positive pitch so that's how this
helicopter<00:01:33.869> gets<00:01:34.380> lift<00:01:34.740> as<00:01:35.070> you're<00:01:35.939> giving<00:01:36.270> it

00:01:36.349 --> 00:01:36.359 
helicopter gets lift as you're giving it

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:40.520 
helicopter gets lift as you're giving it
throttle<00:01:38.450> you're<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.659> watch<00:01:39.840> as<00:01:40.170> you

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
throttle you're going to watch as you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.649 
throttle you're going to watch as you
push<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.890> up<00:01:41.039> and<00:01:41.429> watch<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.969> blades<00:01:42.210> pitch

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
push it up and watch the blades pitch

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.709 
push it up and watch the blades pitch
and<00:01:42.990> give<00:01:43.259> you<00:01:43.409> give<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:43.890> lift<00:01:44.130> now<00:01:44.939> for<00:01:45.570> the

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
and give you give you lift now for the

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:47.840 
and give you give you lift now for the
aileron<00:01:46.289> and<00:01:46.590> elevator<00:01:47.159> control<00:01:47.579> which<00:01:47.729> is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
aileron and elevator control which is

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.370 
aileron and elevator control which is
basically<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.270> helicopter<00:01:48.749> moving<00:01:49.049> back<00:01:49.200> and

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
basically the helicopter moving back and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.859 
basically the helicopter moving back and
forth<00:01:49.469> you<00:01:50.340> have<00:01:50.520> your<00:01:50.700> forward<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.359> back<00:01:51.569> and

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
forth you have your forward and back and

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.169 
forth you have your forward and back and
your<00:01:52.319> left<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.740> right<00:01:53.009> and<00:01:53.280> basically<00:01:53.999> what

00:01:54.169 --> 00:01:54.179 
your left and right and basically what

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:55.819 
your left and right and basically what
this<00:01:54.299> does<00:01:54.539> in<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> RC<00:01:55.140> helicopters<00:01:55.799> that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
this does in the RC helicopters that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.639 
this does in the RC helicopters that
controls<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.700> fly<00:01:57.450> bar<00:01:57.749> and<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.020> fly<00:01:58.259> bar<00:01:58.530> is

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
controls the fly bar and the fly bar is

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.349 
controls the fly bar and the fly bar is
responsible<00:01:59.219> for<00:01:59.429> the<00:01:59.490> helicopter<00:02:00.060> moving

00:02:00.349 --> 00:02:00.359 
responsible for the helicopter moving

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.429 
responsible for the helicopter moving
back<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:00.719> forth<00:02:00.810> so<00:02:01.740> I'm<00:02:02.189> going<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.549> push<00:02:02.759> the

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
back and forth so I'm going to push the

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.889 
back and forth so I'm going to push the
the<00:02:04.439> control<00:02:04.799> forward<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.509> that's<00:02:06.509> the

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
the control forward and that's the

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.980 
the control forward and that's the
swashplate<00:02:07.499> moving<00:02:08.220> forward<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.600> what<00:02:09.960> that

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
swashplate moving forward so what that

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.830 
swashplate moving forward so what that
is<00:02:10.259> that<00:02:10.440> there's<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.710> center<00:02:11.069> bearing<00:02:11.310> and

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
is that there's a center bearing and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.330 
is that there's a center bearing and
different<00:02:12.840> levers<00:02:13.019> that<00:02:13.200> act<00:02:13.590> on<00:02:13.799> it

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
different levers that act on it

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.280 
different levers that act on it
and<00:02:14.430> allow<00:02:14.910> to<00:02:14.970> move<00:02:15.390> so<00:02:15.599> that's<00:02:15.780> forward

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
and allow to move so that's forward

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:20.390 
and allow to move so that's forward
that's<00:02:16.920> back<00:02:17.420> that's<00:02:18.420> right<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.290> that's<00:02:20.069> left

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
that's back that's right and that's left

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.729 
that's back that's right and that's left
and<00:02:20.760> what<00:02:21.540> that's<00:02:21.750> doing<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.230> that's<00:02:22.470> moving

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
and what that's doing is that's moving

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.940 
and what that's doing is that's moving
you<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.459> see<00:02:23.610> the<00:02:23.700> flood<00:02:23.940> bar<00:02:24.209> moving<00:02:24.629> and<00:02:24.950> the

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
you can see the flood bar moving and the

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.710 
you can see the flood bar moving and the
fly<00:02:26.190> bar<00:02:26.459> is<00:02:26.580> really<00:02:26.819> responsible<00:02:26.970> for<00:02:27.629> the

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
fly bar is really responsible for the

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.990 
fly bar is really responsible for the
helicopters<00:02:28.379> movement<00:02:28.920> and<00:02:29.099> when<00:02:29.489> this<00:02:29.700> moves

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
helicopters movement and when this moves

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.300 
helicopters movement and when this moves
one<00:02:30.269> way<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:31.140> whole<00:02:31.290> head<00:02:31.560> kind<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:31.980> follows

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
one way the whole head kind of follows

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.680 
one way the whole head kind of follows
it<00:02:32.489> and<00:02:32.670> that's<00:02:32.819> how<00:02:32.940> you<00:02:33.000> get<00:02:33.180> forward<00:02:33.599> and

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
it and that's how you get forward and

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.380 
it and that's how you get forward and
back<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:33.900> left<00:02:34.650> and<00:02:34.860> right<00:02:35.010> flight<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:36.030> a

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
back and left and right flight so a

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.759 
back and left and right flight so a
combination<00:02:36.900> of<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.590> two<00:02:38.750> you<00:02:39.750> get<00:02:39.959> you<00:02:40.650> know

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:40.769 
combination of the two you get you know

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.210 
combination of the two you get you know
lift<00:02:41.760> or<00:02:42.599> blade<00:02:42.840> pitch<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.440> then<00:02:44.010> you<00:02:44.099> get

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
lift or blade pitch and then you get

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.339 
lift or blade pitch and then you get
swashplate<00:02:44.549> movement<00:02:45.299> to<00:02:45.720> make<00:02:45.870> that<00:02:46.049> look<00:02:46.170> up

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
swashplate movement to make that look up

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.080 
swashplate movement to make that look up
to<00:02:46.470> go<00:02:46.620> which<00:02:46.739> way<00:02:46.860> you<00:02:46.920> want<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.310> go<00:02:47.459> so

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
to go which way you want to go so

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.420 
to go which way you want to go so
there's<00:02:48.269> two<00:02:48.510> separate<00:02:49.110> independent<00:02:49.829> moving

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
there's two separate independent moving

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.660 
there's two separate independent moving
systems<00:02:50.880> here<00:02:51.269> you<00:02:51.870> can<00:02:52.049> see<00:02:52.319> you<00:02:53.280> can<00:02:53.400> see<00:02:53.549> the

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
systems here you can see you can see the

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.100 
systems here you can see you can see the
fly<00:02:53.910> bar<00:02:54.209> system<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.810> moving<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:56.040> head

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110 
fly bar system is moving that the head

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.690 
fly bar system is moving that the head
left<00:02:58.110> and<00:02:58.260> right<00:02:58.470> up<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:58.739> down<00:02:58.980> but<00:02:59.430> when<00:02:59.610> you

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
left and right up and down but when you

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.640 
left and right up and down but when you
do<00:02:59.819> throttle<00:03:00.329> the<00:03:00.660> whole<00:03:00.870> system<00:03:01.110> moves<00:03:01.500> up

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
do throttle the whole system moves up

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.020 
do throttle the whole system moves up
and<00:03:01.799> down<00:03:01.890> when<00:03:02.129> the<00:03:02.190> whole<00:03:02.310> system<00:03:02.519> moves<00:03:02.879> up

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
and down when the whole system moves up

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.860 
and down when the whole system moves up
and<00:03:03.209> down<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:04.290> get<00:03:04.500> blade<00:03:04.799> pitch<00:03:05.569> so<00:03:06.569> both

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
and down you get blade pitch so both

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.930 
and down you get blade pitch so both
work<00:03:07.140> together<00:03:07.319> so<00:03:08.069> hope<00:03:08.430> this<00:03:08.610> answer<00:03:08.910> is

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
work together so hope this answer is

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.580 
work together so hope this answer is
that<00:03:09.269> some<00:03:09.660> of<00:03:09.750> the<00:03:09.810> questions<00:03:10.140> on<00:03:10.290> how<00:03:10.440> this

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
that some of the questions on how this

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.229 
that some of the questions on how this
work<00:03:10.769> it's<00:03:10.980> complicated<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.090> works

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
work it's complicated but it works

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.510 
work it's complicated but it works
pretty<00:03:12.390> well
