00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 helau alaaf where to be at this carnevals 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.930
 you can not even talk about that topic 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.859
 welcome directly without anyone 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.599
 to make enemies 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.630
 I think it's easier to talk about 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.420
 Israel the US and Russia at the same time 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.550
 Talk about carnival without someone 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.930
 to pee on the leg so not so 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.820
 literally pee on the leg 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.650
 I think in this time will be like that 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.480
 Many people peed on the leg 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.789
 but I try it one must 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.609
 explain so dear extraterrestrial 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.260
 fellow citizens and fellow citizens and like 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.600
 many of them are always involved 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.920
 where are you actually annoying 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.309
 no fellow citizens you are still alive 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.879
 not here so long are you still 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:44.040
 citizen citizens without citizens 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.079
 Anyway, if you are in the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.910
 the next day, the earth plans to 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.579
 watch and that in just 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.379
 score points like Cologne or Mainz want to do 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.710
 then you have to be very precise now 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.579
 listen what you see is not 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.739
 the apocalypse 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.840
 you might think that's that if 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.730
 not worse but that is not 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.530
 apocalypse apocalypse is the first 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.000
 if it goes longer than three days and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.920
 the people foam in front of the mouth 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.080
 no, what happened there is a complete one 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.909
 normal cultural phenomenon and names 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.830
 carnival or carnival 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.060
 that goes back to prehistoric times 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.009
 just one other part, many great 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.470
 eaten cherries and then it was on 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.659
 once tradition for nonsense but it 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.100
 would be more logical and easier to explain 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.350
 Well at least that's right with the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.430
 Tradition once a year behave yourself 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.380
 the people in some cities 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.290
 Germany so that I myself no 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.119
 words for it find it strange it hits 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.220
 I do not think so because it is not rare 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.530
 rather strange not because the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.939
 do not notice it scary either 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.189
 because I am more afraid of a tree 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.439
 as with a drunken pirate 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:45.840
 Painted bath so we take that 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.880
 Word the young girl use if she 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.970
 Celebrating yourself as being like 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.960
 they are totally crazy you want 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.860
 probably examples 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.990
 That may not be so bad 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.229
 to prepare you for that ok so 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.540
 a policeman and a bee are making out 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.219
 until you have a spongebob in front of your feet 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.770
 pisses completely normal 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.930
 crowds are standing in the city and 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.940
 cheers in a car on the the 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.979
 Chancellor oversized and in 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.530
 degrading pose is presented and 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.600
 from which is leckerlis raining happened 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.520
 if you ask yourself where from this 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.230
 Tradition does not come then 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.270
 be sure to ask someone who they are 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.280
 that lives that does not matter 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.600
 but I'll explain that to you 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.970
 Carnival was only there for a long time 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.500
 to scare away ghosts important doctrine 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.530
 if you do not understand something then 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.090
 is mostly based on superstition or 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.620
 tax law well and eventually have 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.480
 the people started then too 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.120
 elite with it for a bit 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.989
 that's why there is something like 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.030
 carnival sessions there's the 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.830
 a board is elected and then 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.450
 speak people and then become a table 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.320
 played and then they all know that 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.450
 have to laugh 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:51.300
 that's a similarly complicated one 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.310
 procedures like a wedding or that 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.650
 legislative procedure or the 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.760
 women's carnival 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.709
 men wear their neckties 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.620
 So I really do that, I'll tie that up 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.540
 is not a flowery description for such 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.470
 was the feminism the way out before he 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.510
 has degenerated 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.830
 and then there are quite a few 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.480
 other customs I can tell you but 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.370
 Not all explain because I like them 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.230
 do not understand yourself and you have to 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.940
 do not even look over it 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.100
 It does not even try to get away 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.170
 the historians will understand that 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.850
 Not even 100 years, but if you can 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:22.620
 wants to come over then while 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.329
 The carnival time there will be no one 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.739
 on the contrary, you will wonder 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:27.720
 constantly because of her costume one 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.459
 but only get issued 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.079
 kÃ¶lsch so I think that's the 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.180
 not worth the trip but be honest 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.590
 Do you have something like that? You have to 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.910
 do not be ashamed or are there such 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.470
 states with you only during the 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.380
 Christmas party in psychiatry 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:42.209
 and if you know it 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:43.530
 the best way to do that is to send me the message 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.290
 but please answer as soon as possible 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.290
 by fax or like her favorite 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.290
 communicates
