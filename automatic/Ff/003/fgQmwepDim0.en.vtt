00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.720 

so<00:02:36.530> that<00:02:36.680> we<00:02:36.770> call<00:02:36.890> them<00:02:37.069> that's<00:02:37.370> a<00:02:37.490> bit<00:02:37.640> the

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
so that we call them that's a bit the

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:39.730 
so that we call them that's a bit the
music<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.240> a<00:02:38.300> couple<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.630> the<00:02:38.750> normal<00:02:39.319> mode<00:02:39.500> so

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:39.740 
music and a couple of the normal mode so

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.990 
music and a couple of the normal mode so
obviously<00:02:40.100> you<00:02:40.190> have<00:02:40.220> to<00:02:40.400> collect<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.760> balls

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 
obviously you have to collect the balls

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.370 
obviously you have to collect the balls
and<00:02:41.240> you<00:02:41.330> have<00:02:41.420> to<00:02:41.569> kill<00:02:41.840> people

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
and you have to kill people

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.840 
and you have to kill people
this<00:02:42.740> is<00:02:42.860> one<00:02:43.010> of<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.160> challenges<00:02:43.370> where

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
this is one of the challenges where

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:45.490 
this is one of the challenges where
basically<00:02:44.330> you<00:02:44.510> have<00:02:44.600> to<00:02:44.750> collect<00:02:44.930> all<00:02:45.230> of<00:02:45.290> the

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
basically you have to collect all of the

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.830 
basically you have to collect all of the
balls<00:02:45.709> in<00:02:46.010> the<00:02:46.130> time<00:02:46.370> limit<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.880> then<00:02:47.270> love

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:47.840 
balls in the time limit and then love

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.000 
balls in the time limit and then love
that<00:02:48.050> then<00:02:48.200> if<00:02:48.319> you<00:02:48.410> collect<00:02:48.739> them<00:02:48.830> all<00:02:48.980> and

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
that then if you collect them all and

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.860 
that then if you collect them all and
put<00:02:49.190> them<00:02:49.280> in<00:02:49.340> the<00:02:49.430> goal<00:02:49.610> then<00:02:49.790> you<00:02:49.850> win<00:02:50.000> so

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
put them in the goal then you win so

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.110 
put them in the goal then you win so
pretty<00:02:51.440> standard<00:02:51.830> challenge<00:02:52.160> mode<00:02:52.340> but<00:02:52.730> now

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
pretty standard challenge mode but now

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.220 
pretty standard challenge mode but now
I'm<00:02:53.209> gonna<00:02:53.360> go<00:02:53.510> on<00:02:53.569> to<00:02:53.630> the<00:02:53.720> one<00:02:53.930> that<00:02:54.110> is

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
I'm gonna go on to the one that is

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.830 
I'm gonna go on to the one that is
basically<00:02:54.920> like<00:02:55.160> snick<00:02:55.489> where<00:02:55.850> you<00:02:56.000> like<00:02:56.600> have

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
basically like snick where you like have

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.449 
basically like snick where you like have
no<00:02:57.020> goal<00:02:57.260> you<00:02:57.560> just<00:02:57.590> have<00:02:57.860> them<00:02:57.980> all<00:02:58.130> dragging

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
no goal you just have them all dragging

00:02:58.459 --> 00:02:59.920 
no goal you just have them all dragging
behind<00:02:58.520> it<00:02:58.850> and<00:02:58.970> the<00:02:59.030> whole<00:02:59.150> point<00:02:59.300> is<00:02:59.450> don't

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
behind it and the whole point is don't

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:13.809 
behind it and the whole point is don't
crash<00:03:11.530> so<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.680> golden<00:03:12.950> this<00:03:13.250> is<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.519> snick

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
crash so the golden this is the snick

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.699 
crash so the golden this is the snick
mode<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.450> as<00:03:14.780> I<00:03:14.900> say<00:03:15.080> it<00:03:15.140> is<00:03:15.290> basically<00:03:15.620> like

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
mode and as I say it is basically like

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.890 
mode and as I say it is basically like
cynical<00:03:16.370> point<00:03:16.550> issued<00:03:16.880> on<00:03:17.030> crush<00:03:17.360> and<00:03:17.690> the

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:17.900 
cynical point issued on crush and the

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.210 
cynical point issued on crush and the
balls<00:03:18.110> behind<00:03:18.319> you<00:03:18.650> have<00:03:18.769> moved<00:03:19.010> from<00:03:19.100> the

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
balls behind you have moved from the

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.100 
balls behind you have moved from the
same<00:03:19.550> apartment<00:03:19.760> units<00:03:20.360> so<00:03:20.540> if<00:03:20.630> you<00:03:20.750> do<00:03:20.930> a

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
same apartment units so if you do a

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.750 
same apartment units so if you do a
snake<00:03:21.500> line<00:03:21.739> like<00:03:21.950> that<00:03:22.160> then<00:03:22.400> all<00:03:22.550> of<00:03:22.580> the

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
snake line like that then all of the

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.460 
snake line like that then all of the
balls<00:03:22.940> behind<00:03:23.269> you<00:03:23.450> will<00:03:23.900> eventually<00:03:24.110> go

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
balls behind you will eventually go

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.740 
balls behind you will eventually go
through<00:03:24.500> that<00:03:24.830> snake<00:03:25.100> line<00:03:25.340> so<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.300> gets<00:03:26.540> the

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
through that snake line so it gets the

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.150 
through that snake line so it gets the
point<00:03:26.930> well<00:03:27.200> when<00:03:27.350> you've<00:03:27.440> got<00:03:27.590> nearly<00:03:27.890> a

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
point well when you've got nearly a

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.040 
point well when you've got nearly a
thousand<00:03:28.610> behind<00:03:28.850> you<00:03:29.060> because<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.870> whole

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
thousand behind you because the whole

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:31.539 
thousand behind you because the whole
point<00:03:30.260> is<00:03:30.410> to<00:03:30.440> collect<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.920> thousand<00:03:31.280> on<00:03:31.370> some

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
point is to collect a thousand on some

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.160 
point is to collect a thousand on some
of<00:03:31.640> the<00:03:31.700> wards<00:03:31.970> this<00:03:32.540> one<00:03:32.720> here<00:03:32.900> there's<00:03:33.110> a

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
of the wards this one here there's a

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.259 
of the wards this one here there's a
thousand<00:03:33.560> collect<00:03:33.860> basically<00:03:34.700> it<00:03:34.970> can<00:03:35.150> get

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
thousand collect basically it can get

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:36.880 
thousand collect basically it can get
very<00:03:35.329> tight<00:03:35.870> very<00:03:36.079> cramped<00:03:36.470> in<00:03:36.680> the<00:03:36.739> whole

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
very tight very cramped in the whole

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.900 
very tight very cramped in the whole
point<00:03:37.100> is<00:03:37.220> you<00:03:37.340> have<00:03:37.459> to<00:03:37.579> pretty<00:03:37.730> much<00:03:37.850> just

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
point is you have to pretty much just

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.370 
point is you have to pretty much just
keep<00:03:38.239> double<00:03:38.600> backing<00:03:38.930> on<00:03:39.019> yourself<00:03:39.320> like

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
keep double backing on yourself like

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.860 
keep double backing on yourself like
this<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:40.160> try<00:03:40.360> eventually<00:03:41.360> not<00:03:41.510> to<00:03:41.630> crush<00:03:41.840> it

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
this to try eventually not to crush it

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.350 
this to try eventually not to crush it
basically<00:03:42.230> so<00:03:43.040> that's<00:03:43.579> happened<00:03:44.030> first

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
basically so that's happened first

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.720 
basically so that's happened first
