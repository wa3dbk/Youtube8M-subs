system<00:04:08.040> like<00:04:08.340> the<00:04:08.460> NT<00:04:08.850> six<00:04:09.150> comes<00:04:09.450> into<00:04:09.690> play

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
system like the NT six comes into play

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.440 
system like the NT six comes into play
the<00:04:10.560> MT<00:04:10.860> six<00:04:11.190> is<00:04:11.370> specifically<00:04:11.880> designed<00:04:12.150> for

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
the MT six is specifically designed for

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.210 
the MT six is specifically designed for
difficult<00:04:12.990> mounting<00:04:13.320> applications<00:04:14.040> and

places<00:04:19.320> now<00:04:20.010> let's<00:04:20.250> make<00:04:20.459> this<00:04:20.670> car<00:04:20.970> up<00:04:21.120> and

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
places now let's make this car up and

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:29.240 
places now let's make this car up and

so let's recap microphone selection is

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.710 
so let's recap microphone selection is
just<00:05:09.860> as<00:05:09.980> critical<00:05:10.430> as<00:05:10.520> mic<00:05:10.730> placement<00:05:11.000> when

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:11.720 
just as critical as mic placement when

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.390 
just as critical as mic placement when
you<00:05:11.810> arrive<00:05:12.110> at<00:05:12.140> a<00:05:12.320> location<00:05:12.680> you<00:05:13.040> should<00:05:13.190> pay

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
you arrive at a location you should pay

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.100 
you arrive at a location you should pay

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
attention to how the environment sounds

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.600 
attention to how the environment sounds
and<00:05:15.260> be<00:05:15.380> sure<00:05:15.530> to<00:05:15.560> ask<00:05:15.710> what<00:05:16.070> shots<00:05:16.340> should<00:05:16.490> be

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:16.610 
and be sure to ask what shots should be
