00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.400

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.210
 you have seen is a new car design 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.430
 completely you already know in the video of 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.829
 yesterday that I was going to upload on a video in 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.960
 the forza 5 on the new designs 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:33.610
 about how to make the designs and good 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.920
 you have seen a part now I will put 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.020
 the camera so you can see the car 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.400
 complete and I will go explaining what 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.050
 length of the video how they are doing 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.970
 all these stickers all these 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.590
 car designs so that good for 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.170
 that you do not have strength 5 so that you can 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:49.180
 there can be and there it's going to look like 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.070
 little screen that you will have the greatest 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.870
 part of the time there the little screen 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.820
 right there you see the design for 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:57.460
 what but for you to see it better 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.770
 Sorry, I put the little window in there 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.090
 the different parts of the car I think 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.580
 that the ugliest good there I come from 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.560
 youtuber that I loved and most 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.479
 ugly that is as I say now you will see 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.860
 it's the back that you're good at 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:10.990
 watching in the video that is the shield 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.790
 I wanted to put the shield and I did not know where 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.560
 I did not know whether to put it on the roof 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.939
 of the car but good at the end what 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.070
 It does not matter much behind 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.780
 because good is a design that is not 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.060
 final was simply to teach 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.799
 and well I saw there in that view that 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.390
 I'm not good at driving with that 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.520
 seen then I change it once 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.470
 that you have seen the design of the car 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.330
 Well, you have seen the XV Uruguay 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.729
 on the roof that I love 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:35.590
 I also wanted something to appear 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.170
 xbox one and well that 's nothing an adhesive 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.420
 that now I will explain that since it is coming 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.070
 done and nothing now you are going to see again 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.530
 the little screen and we're going to explain 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.619
 well how do you go doing everything not there 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.619
 you see the menu apply adhesive you see create 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:53.560
 vinyl painting my designs look good 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.320
 look for designs and we go to the first thing 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.600
 to apply adhesives to explain 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.729
 little by little how I've been doing there 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.710
 you see the different layers good there in 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.789
 the side part on one of the sides 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.280
 of the car and beige 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.679
 You see how I've done what youtuber 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.630
 with different layers and others on top of 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.220
 xbox one that now I will tell you but good 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.040
 that is already a sticker that is made for you 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.959
 on the other side the same youtuber with and to 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.550
 side comes the forza 5 that also 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.739
 I wanted him to show up in the car and 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.030
 well what I tell you the shield that 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.860
 it says there good as you see in the 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.990
 different layers does not convince me either 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.760
 a lot but good 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.890
 You see how they are creating themselves 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.990
 different possibilities that you have 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.880
 can create there are stickers that has 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:35.940
 created the people as you see on the left 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.470
 the author comes to you the popularity and they are 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.940
 stickers that you can go 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.980
 applying to your car but good as 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.960
 you see the amount of layers of drawings of 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.190
 things that can be done or are people 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.630
 who is good at this can make a 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.740
 number of drawings in the car that 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.930
 good 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:53.820
 incredible that now now I will teach you 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.350
 know that designs come out and that for 

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:58.390
 to see and well there you see the types of 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.190
 sources that are also many types 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.230
 from sources and there I remove the little window 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.300
 because I wanted to talk about a part 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.980
 Video is this part of me that good 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.500
 it's a little funny because you see there 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.600
 the green car in front what good is 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.120
 a hard nut to crack because it's going to 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.340
 cost a lot to overtake him and as you see 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.020
 here comes the game what dry will tie 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.800
 the different personalities of the 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.540
 cars as you see there in straight wins me and 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.310
 you will see how aggressive this car is 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.110
 I like that also, not that they are 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:28.000
 aggressive as you see there I tried to strain 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.290
 on the inside as it is without hitting the 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.170
 car in front because as you know 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.870
 I have the simulator Damage 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:37.239
 and it hit me even if it was a blow 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:38.530
 I can not smash 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:40.989
 any part of the car and even 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:43.390
 Brake steering good any part 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.130
 she is a stronger blow the engine 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.630
 good if you see me get out of the curve 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:48.819
 because I was already a little desperate 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.430
 to go after him all the time and here 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:53.230
 You see how good I can do better 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.910
 traced and I'm still winning in speed 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.890
 but I say I do not brake or I'm going to 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.450
 stop the last thing already and as you can see there already 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:00.160
 he starts to give me the car from behind 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.860
 green so you can see the different 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.959
 personalities and you see that the super brake 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.239
 super late and I say is that she is already 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.980
 something I have to rewind again and not 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.170
 I have no choice but to let him pass 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.450
 now rewound again and as you see then 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.389
 I have gone before, I let you pass and 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.090
 I'll already pass you either here or in the next 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.070
 curve and good you'll see that you 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.110
 ended up happening here I try to put a 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.330
 little inside but as you see 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.610
 he advances us to another and good above all 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.050
 we needed patience and we will continue 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:30.550
 with the designs not that for that 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.740
 we have uploaded this video there you see that 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.450
 I gave him an advance and what I was saying 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.220
 Uruguay are stickers that come to you 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.500
 done since you come from the game and there 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:41.470
 you are going to see all that come out bmw 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.270
 forza 5 comes out forza 4 there is also to the 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.980
 the right of the xbox appears or is 

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.140
 many designs are many stickers the 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.940
 that you can put in the car and we passed 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.920
 to the next section the vinyl this 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.450
 it's much much more complex since creating 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.220
 vinyl as you have seen for good 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.260
 and then upload them and use them 

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.240
 other users but I have played a lot 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.950
 is that section of vinyl because good 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.110
 I do not have so much patience to create 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.520
 and I'm not completely good and good 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.260
 next section is the painting as 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.060
 You can paint all the parts of the 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:09.340
 car there is the general painting and 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:11.080
 well I show you the different ones 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.360
 different colors and not just colors 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:15.250
 now you will see the different designs that 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.960
 you can give the car in terms of 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:18.700
 painting I have put one pretty 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.350
 classic just so you can see well 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.640
 the drawings the different stickers that 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.620
 I have made but good as you see it 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:25.180
 you can put there are a lot there as if 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.419
 If camouflage could be given 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:31.450
 lots of paint to the car and also 

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:34.240
 as you can see the capo that if the spoiler 

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.919
 that if the windows if the tires or 

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.960
 you can paint everything you want 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.110
 and well all this is also have a 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.640
 I like some patience tells you there 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.650
 it's just a little bit for them to see 

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.600
 the adhesives there you see the different 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.490
 designs that I have 

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.170
 the urban team design I have seen or 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:50.700
 the uncle goes to the left and the 

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:52.890
 popularity that it has is an expertise that 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.600
 had to have that boy to do 

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:55.860
 that piece of design that I love 

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.290
 you know I've put it in all 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.000
 all the videos and well there already appear 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.270
 the designs of the people those who have 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.270
 I imagine that more popularity 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:09.000
 Some of them are the truth that the 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.880
 people do it very hard, not what 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.580
 to create designs and I imagine 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.130
 that little by little I will be improving my design 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:19.620
 and then putting more things safely 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:21.810
 the shield changes it from there but now 

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.030
 I say that I put the shield there just 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:26.100
 to seeing him and for him to see the 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.770
 different layers that used and so on and 

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:31.800
 I want the design to be something like that 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.600
 not something in youtuber plan and so on and 

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:36.000
 nothing since the video is ending as 

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.590
 you see there fourth I wanted to finish in 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.270
 podium and now you see in the last 

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:40.860
 curves that I'm a bit more aggressive 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:43.050
 but good luckily it does not destroy me 

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:44.520
 nothing of the car yes it is true that 

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:46.470
 hit the car in front here but 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:48.570
 how do you see that they are the last 

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:50.640
 curves we are already arriving and good if 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.720
 Now I get in. I say, I have to get in. Yes 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:54.360
 or yes 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.010
 I was the last corner and I get in the 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.120
 inside if I give you if I destroyed the 

00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.790
 good car so be what God 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:07:01.800
 I want no but good luckily I do not 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:03.450
 it destroyed nothing and nothing this was 

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.580
 mainly the video I wanted to show you 

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:08.490
 everything that has to do with the subject of 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:10.680
 designs since it is a world sincerely 

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.360
 because the people who know the people that 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.760
 he knows how to create designs that he knows how to do 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:17.430
 drawings with the different layers then 

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.200
 It can be incredible, not good 

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:20.700

 next video that goes up then 

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.590

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:27.330
