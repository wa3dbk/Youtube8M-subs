in<00:00:04.760> geometry<00:00:05.210> it's<00:00:05.660> imperative<00:00:06.290> that<00:00:06.620> you<00:00:07.040> can

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 
in geometry it's imperative that you can

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.700 
in geometry it's imperative that you can
write<00:00:07.340> a<00:00:07.370> good<00:00:07.580> definition<00:00:08.290> because<00:00:09.290> then<00:00:09.590> it

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
write a good definition because then it

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.259 
write a good definition because then it
will<00:00:09.830> help<00:00:09.950> you<00:00:10.099> understand<00:00:10.639> the<00:00:10.730> properties

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:11.269 
will help you understand the properties

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.940 
will help you understand the properties
of<00:00:11.420> whatever<00:00:11.870> it<00:00:12.110> is<00:00:12.169> you're<00:00:12.349> talking<00:00:12.530> about

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
of whatever it is you're talking about

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.009 
of whatever it is you're talking about
the<00:00:13.639> three<00:00:13.940> key<00:00:14.120> components<00:00:14.690> of<00:00:14.749> a<00:00:14.839> good

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:15.019 
the three key components of a good

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.440 
the three key components of a good
definition<00:00:15.230> the<00:00:16.129> first<00:00:16.430> one<00:00:16.640> it<00:00:17.150> uses

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:17.450 
definition the first one it uses

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.960 
definition the first one it uses
previously<00:00:18.230> defined<00:00:18.560> terms<00:00:18.920> so<00:00:19.730> if<00:00:19.820> you've

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:19.970 
previously defined terms so if you've

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.240 
previously defined terms so if you've
already<00:00:20.120> defined<00:00:20.840> what<00:00:21.170> parallel<00:00:21.770> lines<00:00:22.010> are

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
already defined what parallel lines are

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.710 
already defined what parallel lines are
you<00:00:22.820> can<00:00:22.940> use<00:00:23.090> that<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.390> define<00:00:23.660> a

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
you can use that to define a

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.010 
you can use that to define a
parallelogram<00:00:24.940> secondly<00:00:25.940> it<00:00:26.120> classifies<00:00:26.810> and

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
parallelogram secondly it classifies and

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.610 
parallelogram secondly it classifies and
quantifies<00:00:27.980> that<00:00:28.280> is<00:00:29.060> by<00:00:29.360> classifying<00:00:30.020> it<00:00:30.260> is

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:30.620 
quantifies that is by classifying it is

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.580 
quantifies that is by classifying it is
that<00:00:30.830> a<00:00:30.890> polygon<00:00:31.370> is<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:32.210> line<00:00:32.480> what<00:00:33.140> is<00:00:33.170> it

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:33.590 
that a polygon is the line what is it

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.369 
that a polygon is the line what is it
and<00:00:33.820> quantifies<00:00:34.820> how<00:00:35.059> many<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.199> if<00:00:36.260> you're

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:36.379 
and quantifies how many so if you're

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:37.959 
and quantifies how many so if you're
talking<00:00:36.469> about<00:00:36.679> a<00:00:36.769> polygon<00:00:37.280> you're<00:00:37.789> going<00:00:37.910> to

00:00:37.959 --> 00:00:37.969 
talking about a polygon you're going to

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:40.900 
talking about a polygon you're going to
want<00:00:38.120> to<00:00:38.210> say<00:00:38.390> how<00:00:38.780> many<00:00:38.839> sides<00:00:39.289> and<00:00:39.699> last<00:00:40.699> it

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
want to say how many sides and last it

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.149 
want to say how many sides and last it
has<00:00:41.089> no<00:00:41.480> counter<00:00:41.929> example<00:00:42.350> but<00:00:42.800> what<00:00:42.980> is<00:00:43.129> a

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:43.159 
has no counter example but what is a

00:00:43.159 --> 00:00:45.130 
has no counter example but what is a
counter<00:00:43.579> example<00:00:43.670> well<00:00:44.629> a<00:00:44.659> counter<00:00:45.019> example

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
counter example well a counter example

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.919 
counter example well a counter example
is<00:00:45.589> something<00:00:46.070> an<00:00:46.460> example<00:00:47.120> that<00:00:47.629> will<00:00:47.749> make<00:00:47.899> a

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
is something an example that will make a

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:50.860 
is something an example that will make a
definition<00:00:48.440> or<00:00:48.800> conjecture<00:00:49.249> incorrect<00:00:50.089> so<00:00:50.749> if

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
definition or conjecture incorrect so if

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.239 
definition or conjecture incorrect so if
you<00:00:50.960> can<00:00:51.079> find<00:00:51.199> a<00:00:51.319> counter<00:00:51.589> example<00:00:52.039> to<00:00:52.069> your

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:52.249 
you can find a counter example to your

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:54.189 
you can find a counter example to your
definition<00:00:52.429> you<00:00:53.269> haven't<00:00:53.719> written<00:00:53.839> a<00:00:54.019> good

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
definition you haven't written a good

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.549 
definition you haven't written a good
one<00:00:54.379> so<00:00:55.159> a<00:00:55.190> short<00:00:55.789> example<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.809> let's<00:00:57.109> say<00:00:57.319> I

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:57.559 
one so a short example is let's say I

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.599 
one so a short example is let's say I
had<00:00:58.129> a<00:00:58.159> square<00:00:58.699> and<00:00:59.469> I<00:01:00.469> said<00:01:00.710> that<00:01:00.859> a<00:01:00.890> square<00:01:01.370> is

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:01.609 
had a square and I said that a square is

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:09.219 
had a square and I said that a square is
a<00:01:02.239> quadrilateral<00:01:07.600> which<00:01:08.600> means<00:01:08.840> that<00:01:09.079> it<00:01:09.200> has

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
a quadrilateral which means that it has

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:11.859 
a quadrilateral which means that it has
four<00:01:09.740> sides<00:01:10.040> and<00:01:10.340> I<00:01:10.820> just<00:01:11.060> left<00:01:11.180> my<00:01:11.360> definition

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:11.869 
four sides and I just left my definition

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.230 
four sides and I just left my definition
like<00:01:11.990> that<00:01:12.200> turned<00:01:12.770> it<00:01:12.860> into<00:01:12.979> mr.<00:01:13.250> McCaul<00:01:13.549> well

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
like that turned it into mr. McCaul well

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.240 
like that turned it into mr. McCaul well
I'm<00:01:14.329> gonna<00:01:14.420> say<00:01:14.630> a<00:01:14.869> quadrilateral<00:01:15.770> well<00:01:16.100> that

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
I'm gonna say a quadrilateral well that

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.999 
I'm gonna say a quadrilateral well that
could<00:01:16.430> be<00:01:16.549> on<00:01:16.939> trapezoid<00:01:17.619> where<00:01:18.619> I<00:01:18.680> could<00:01:18.860> draw

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
could be on trapezoid where I could draw

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.219 
could be on trapezoid where I could draw
in<00:01:19.070> one<00:01:19.549> pair<00:01:19.789> of<00:01:19.850> parallel<00:01:20.090> sides<00:01:20.240> now<00:01:21.170> it

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:21.229 
in one pair of parallel sides now it

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.219 
in one pair of parallel sides now it
could<00:01:21.350> be<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.500> kite<00:01:21.860> where<00:01:22.310> we<00:01:22.430> have<00:01:22.960> two<00:01:23.960> pairs

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
could be a kite where we have two pairs

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.920 
could be a kite where we have two pairs
of<00:01:24.350> congruent<00:01:24.880> consecutive<00:01:25.880> sides<00:01:26.119> I<00:01:26.390> could

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
of congruent consecutive sides I could

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.359 
of congruent consecutive sides I could
draw<00:01:27.079> in<00:01:27.140> a<00:01:27.259> rhombus<00:01:27.680> I<00:01:27.860> could<00:01:28.009> draw<00:01:28.189> in<00:01:28.310> a

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:28.369 
draw in a rhombus I could draw in a

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.639 
draw in a rhombus I could draw in a
parallelogram<00:01:28.880> either<00:01:29.810> drawing<00:01:30.140> lots<00:01:30.409> of

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
parallelogram either drawing lots of

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:33.010 
parallelogram either drawing lots of
counter<00:01:31.070> examples<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:32.570> would<00:01:32.659> make<00:01:32.840> this

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
counter examples that would make this

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.560 
counter examples that would make this
definition<00:01:33.469> not<00:01:34.009> true<00:01:34.399> or<00:01:34.640> wouldn't<00:01:35.240> make<00:01:35.420> it

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
definition not true or wouldn't make it

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.679 
definition not true or wouldn't make it
specific<00:01:36.109> enough<00:01:36.619> for<00:01:36.859> just<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.490> square<00:01:37.789> so

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:38.689 
specific enough for just a square so

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.929 
specific enough for just a square so
I'll<00:01:38.750> get<00:01:38.899> to<00:01:38.930> other<00:01:39.200> ones<00:01:39.789> let's<00:01:40.789> say

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
I'll get to other ones let's say

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.810 
I'll get to other ones let's say
something<00:01:41.149> that's<00:01:41.329> now<00:01:41.509> related<00:01:41.960> to<00:01:42.020> geometry

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:42.820 
something that's now related to geometry
