 of those most affected by the conditions 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.580
 of the sea and had to paralyze the work 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.330

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.280
 structure below are you are 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.619
 loosening breasts by the blows of 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.539
 big waves that burst like the 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.159
 new construction that was made for the 

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:54.979
 part of here 

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.409
 from esplanade 9 where there are some 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.590
 new wooden supports but the 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:04.159
 destruction you see as much the majority 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:06.319
 it's already loose we have damage and a boat of 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.850
 he wins them and others who won two more 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.519
 but they are not without damage there is one with 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.560
 damage and then the shocks that 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:14.840
 have stuck with the engines but it's not 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.870
 both the damage 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.720
 in the north if you throw one that went down 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:24.590
 at this time another vessel arrived 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:27.080
 mothers and try to save is the most 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.319
 big gay after here there were two 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:32.690
 that they did not totally strip and there's 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.150
 several that have some let's say 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.129
 scratch the effects of strong waves 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.379
 They also affected entrepreneurs from 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:42.860
 import sector as happened in the 

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:44.400
 route to the unknown sailor came very 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.939
 strong water 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:51.239
 very dangerous sea â€‹â€‹today and I eat here 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:53.909
 I live 14 years but I think the second 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:57.319
 month I have seen this water was bundled to race 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:00.599
 but very strong not anti came out like now 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:04.650
 and as news says that afternoon like 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:07.349
 more brave wave but I have to give a 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.400
 message for all people who please 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.200
 take care to save lives however 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.390
 nautical sportsmen appreciate the 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.730
 show what the big ones mean 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.750
 beautiful waves I like sports are 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:25.600
 unique opportunities 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:29.400
 The same is fire because you can not 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.900
 surfing like that but some parts that are 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.310
 the bass that are the big ones that 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.820
 they run with the same boat so they are 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.040
 good together with the measures to help the 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:40.930
 the victims transit cuts 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.940
 armada and carabineros also have 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.020

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.020

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.940

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.310
