got like a little photograph there's
there's<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.670> much<00:01:53.790> you<00:01:53.850> can<00:01:54.000> get<00:01:54.150> from<00:01:54.240> this

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
there's so much you can get from this

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
kind of over analyzing it but looking at

this straight away you can the even the
photograph<00:02:00.750> itself<00:02:00.900> but<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.259> paper<00:02:01.530> is<00:02:01.650> made

about that definitely hints that we

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.029 
about that definitely hints that we

zombie<00:04:37.319> that<00:04:37.830> is<00:04:37.979> a<00:04:38.009> German<00:04:38.669> Nazi<00:04:39.180> said<00:04:39.449> you

00:04:39.739 --> 00:04:39.749 
zombie that is a German Nazi said you

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:42.170 
zombie that is a German Nazi said you

know World War two and it just seems

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:43.100 
know World War two and it just seems
everything's<00:04:42.599> pointed<00:04:42.930> in<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.020> direction

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
everything's pointed in that direction

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:44.809 
everything's pointed in that direction
right<00:04:43.589> now<00:04:43.710> i'll<00:04:43.889> do<00:04:44.069> a<00:04:44.099> video<00:04:44.309> all<00:04:44.610> the

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:44.819 
right now i'll do a video all the

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:45.679 
right now i'll do a video all the
different<00:04:45.059> things<00:04:45.089> but<00:04:45.300> this<00:04:45.419> definitely

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:45.689 
different things but this definitely

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.189 
different things but this definitely
seems<00:04:45.990> like<00:04:46.169> the<00:04:46.650> most<00:04:47.210> did<00:04:48.210> you<00:04:48.659> know<00:04:48.779> add<00:04:49.020> the

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:49.199 
seems like the most did you know add the

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:50.779 
seems like the most did you know add the
most<00:04:49.379> prominent<00:04:49.650> thing<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.249> only<00:04:50.400> thing<00:04:50.550> that

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:50.789 
most prominent thing the only thing that

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:52.249 
most prominent thing the only thing that
puts<00:04:50.969> me<00:04:51.120> off<00:04:51.150> is<00:04:51.449> the<00:04:51.719> weapon<00:04:52.020> because<00:04:52.229> it

00:04:52.249 --> 00:04:52.259 
puts me off is the weapon because it

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:53.839 
puts me off is the weapon because it
looks<00:04:52.499> at<00:04:52.650> like<00:04:52.770> a<00:04:52.800> futuristic<00:04:53.189> weapon<00:04:53.669> so

00:04:53.839 --> 00:04:53.849 
looks at like a futuristic weapon so

00:04:53.849 --> 00:04:55.579 
looks at like a futuristic weapon so
that<00:04:53.999> can't<00:04:54.300> be<00:04:54.389> you<00:04:54.749> can't<00:04:54.960> have<00:04:55.080> futuristic

War 2 zombies in a different era game so

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:11.239 
War 2 zombies in a different era game so
like<00:05:09.870> for<00:05:10.409> instance<00:05:10.469> we<00:05:10.830> could<00:05:11.039> have<00:05:11.219> a

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:11.249 
like for instance we could have a

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:14.360 
like for instance we could have a
futuristic<00:05:12.089> game<00:05:12.659> but<00:05:13.259> with<00:05:13.409> zombies<00:05:13.860> in<00:05:14.069> the

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:14.370 
futuristic game but with zombies in the

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.739 
futuristic game but with zombies in the
past<00:05:14.580> because<00:05:14.759> you<00:05:15.120> know<00:05:15.210> we<00:05:15.330> have<00:05:15.449> black<00:05:15.599> ops

00:05:15.739 --> 00:05:15.749 
past because you know we have black ops

00:05:15.749 --> 00:05:17.869 
past because you know we have black ops
2<00:05:15.990> which<00:05:16.139> is<00:05:16.289> you<00:05:17.009> know<00:05:17.039> 25<00:05:17.490> years<00:05:17.669> in<00:05:17.819> the

00:05:17.869 --> 00:05:17.879 
2 which is you know 25 years in the

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:21.189 
2 which is you know 25 years in the
future<00:05:17.999> so<00:05:18.659> not<00:05:18.839> 25<00:05:19.169> a<00:05:19.680> bit<00:05:20.159> in<00:05:20.219> the<00:05:20.309> future<00:05:20.610> and

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
future so not 25 a bit in the future and

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.529 
future so not 25 a bit in the future and
we<00:05:22.199> still<00:05:22.469> had<00:05:22.620> World<00:05:22.830> War<00:05:23.129> one<00:05:23.550> zombies

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
we still had World War one zombies

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:26.749 
we still had World War one zombies
alright<00:05:25.259> but<00:05:25.439> I<00:05:25.469> think<00:05:25.680> that<00:05:25.800> re<00:05:25.919> set<00:05:26.189> up<00:05:26.370> for

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
alright but I think that re set up for

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:27.860 
alright but I think that re set up for
the<00:05:26.819> next<00:05:26.849> guy<00:05:27.089> I<00:05:27.120> think<00:05:27.300> that<00:05:27.419> really<00:05:27.449> hinted

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
the next guy I think that really hinted

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:29.360 
the next guy I think that really hinted
for<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.050> next<00:05:28.229> game<00:05:28.349> which<00:05:28.800> we're<00:05:28.979> seeing<00:05:29.219> in

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
for the next game which we're seeing in

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.100 
for the next game which we're seeing in
this<00:05:29.520> image<00:05:29.729> here<00:05:29.849> so<00:05:29.999> this<00:05:30.120> is<00:05:30.270> a<00:05:30.300> teaser<00:05:30.539> the

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:31.110 
this image here so this is a teaser the

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.200 
this image here so this is a teaser the
paper<00:05:31.649> itself<00:05:31.979> definitely<00:05:32.490> seems<00:05:32.729> like<00:05:32.909> the

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:33.210 
paper itself definitely seems like the

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:34.519 
paper itself definitely seems like the
old<00:05:33.389> kind<00:05:33.599> of<00:05:33.749> photographic<00:05:34.169> paper<00:05:34.259> that<00:05:34.499> you

question mark on it you know is kind of
hinting<00:05:38.639> and<00:05:38.849> saying<00:05:39.120> this<00:05:39.479> is<00:05:39.629> a<00:05:39.659> tease<00:05:39.930> you

the main one and it's really exciting to

00:05:46.949 --> 00:05:47.959 
the main one and it's really exciting to

two as one of the ears and that might

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:59.329 
two as one of the ears and that might
not<00:05:58.110> be<00:05:58.169> the<00:05:58.319> main<00:05:58.620> area<00:05:58.919> that<00:05:58.949> the<00:05:59.189> whole

00:05:59.329 --> 00:05:59.339 
not be the main area that the whole

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:06.529 
surrounded by but it definitely seems
like<00:06:05.639> this<00:06:05.759> is<00:06:05.819> happening<00:06:06.180> for<00:06:06.300> zombies

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
like this is happening for zombies

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:08.420 
like this is happening for zombies
because<00:06:06.629> it<00:06:06.809> looks<00:06:07.020> like<00:06:07.169> an<00:06:07.259> unusual<00:06:07.709> map<00:06:07.860> the

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:08.430 
because it looks like an unusual map the

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:10.189 
because it looks like an unusual map the
only<00:06:08.789> map<00:06:08.969> that<00:06:09.120> this<00:06:09.240> could<00:06:09.509> be<00:06:09.629> as<00:06:09.749> origins

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
only map that this could be as origins

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.709 
only map that this could be as origins
but<00:06:10.349> we've<00:06:10.499> never<00:06:10.709> seen<00:06:10.979> that<00:06:11.039> weapon<00:06:11.490> and<00:06:12.419> so

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:12.719 
but we've never seen that weapon and so

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:15.949 
but we've never seen that weapon and so
is<00:06:13.050> that<00:06:13.770> weapon<00:06:14.550> has<00:06:14.789> it's<00:06:15.599> not<00:06:15.749> a<00:06:15.779> weapon

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:15.959 
is that weapon has it's not a weapon

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:19.040 
is that weapon has it's not a weapon
we've<00:06:16.169> seen<00:06:16.349> in<00:06:16.559> zombies<00:06:17.009> before<00:06:17.569> it<00:06:18.569> some

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:19.050 
we've seen in zombies before it some

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:21.049 
we've seen in zombies before it some
people<00:06:19.289> think<00:06:19.379> it<00:06:19.499> could<00:06:19.620> be<00:06:19.709> the<00:06:19.770> PDW<00:06:20.669> but<00:06:20.909> it

00:06:21.049 --> 00:06:21.059 
people think it could be the PDW but it

00:06:21.059 --> 00:06:23.540 
people think it could be the PDW but it
does<00:06:21.419> look<00:06:21.569> like<00:06:21.599> the<00:06:22.050> PDW<00:06:22.680> but<00:06:22.889> the<00:06:23.069> barrel<00:06:23.430> is

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
does look like the PDW but the barrel is

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.399 
does look like the PDW but the barrel is
way<00:06:23.699> too<00:06:23.759> long<00:06:24.059> the<00:06:24.629> other<00:06:24.899> one<00:06:25.050> it<00:06:25.139> could<00:06:25.349> be

00:06:25.399 --> 00:06:25.409 
way too long the other one it could be

00:06:25.409 --> 00:06:28.429 
way too long the other one it could be
is<00:06:25.740> the<00:06:26.009> STG<00:06:26.819> 44<00:06:27.180> I<00:06:27.539> think<00:06:27.749> was<00:06:27.839> cool<00:06:28.169> but<00:06:28.289> it's

00:06:28.429 --> 00:06:28.439 
is the STG 44 I think was cool but it's

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:30.799 
is the STG 44 I think was cool but it's
slightly<00:06:28.740> out<00:06:29.039> it's<00:06:29.249> not<00:06:29.430> out<00:06:29.729> the<00:06:30.479> normal

00:06:30.799 --> 00:06:30.809 
slightly out it's not out the normal

00:06:30.809 --> 00:06:32.320 
slightly out it's not out the normal
shape<00:06:30.990> so<00:06:31.199> it<00:06:31.229> probably<00:06:31.649> isn't<00:06:31.860> that<00:06:32.039> either

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
shape so it probably isn't that either

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:34.549 
shape so it probably isn't that either
so<00:06:33.330> I<00:06:33.360> don't<00:06:33.539> know<00:06:33.749> what<00:06:33.899> weapon<00:06:34.259> the<00:06:34.379> only

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:34.559 
so I don't know what weapon the only

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:36.079 
so I don't know what weapon the only
thing<00:06:34.680> throws<00:06:34.889> me<00:06:35.069> off<00:06:35.159> Alexia's<00:06:35.759> weapon

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:36.089 
thing throws me off Alexia's weapon

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:37.369 
thing throws me off Alexia's weapon
apart<00:06:36.449> from<00:06:36.569> that<00:06:36.599> it<00:06:36.749> definitely<00:06:36.930> looks<00:06:37.259> like

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:37.379 
apart from that it definitely looks like

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:38.809 
apart from that it definitely looks like
it's<00:06:37.499> going<00:06:37.589> to<00:06:37.680> be<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:37.770> world<00:06:38.129> war<00:06:38.219> 2<00:06:38.430> setting

00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 
it's going to be a world war 2 setting

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:40.189 
it's going to be a world war 2 setting
kiri<00:06:39.149> world<00:06:39.360> will<00:06:39.509> run<00:06:39.629> setting<00:06:39.959> but<00:06:40.080> they've

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:40.199 
kiri world will run setting but they've

00:06:40.199 --> 00:06:42.019 
kiri world will run setting but they've
already<00:06:40.349> done<00:06:40.589> that<00:06:40.770> for<00:06:41.009> origins<00:06:41.520> so<00:06:41.879> I<00:06:41.909> don't

00:06:42.019 --> 00:06:42.029 
already done that for origins so I don't

00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:43.070 
already done that for origins so I don't
think<00:06:42.270> they<00:06:42.330> go<00:06:42.509> back<00:06:42.689> to<00:06:42.719> that<00:06:42.959> I<00:06:43.020> think

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:43.080 
think they go back to that I think

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.319 
think they go back to that I think
they'd<00:06:43.469> carry<00:06:43.800> on<00:06:43.979> and<00:06:44.219> go<00:06:44.579> on<00:06:44.729> to<00:06:44.879> World<00:06:45.060> War<00:06:45.089> 2

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:45.329 
they'd carry on and go on to World War 2

00:06:45.329 --> 00:06:46.730 
they'd carry on and go on to World War 2
so<00:06:45.509> let<00:06:45.659> me<00:06:45.719> guys<00:06:45.839> know<00:06:45.899> what<00:06:45.990> you<00:06:46.079> think<00:06:46.289> hope
