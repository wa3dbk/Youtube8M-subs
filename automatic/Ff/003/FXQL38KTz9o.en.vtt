00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
the specs and and how much they okay we

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.230 
the specs and and how much they okay we
hold<00:02:03.810> it<00:02:03.960> up<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.200> our<00:02:04.369> big<00:02:05.369> monitor<00:02:05.759> over<00:02:06.000> here

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
hold it up to our big monitor over here

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.630 
hold it up to our big monitor over here
so<00:02:06.540> basically<00:02:07.049> one<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.619> the<00:02:07.710> things<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.160> we

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
so basically one of the things that we

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.669 
so basically one of the things that we
read<00:02:08.879> about<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.239> order<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.539> 6<00:02:09.720> plus<00:02:09.929> is<00:02:10.200> it<00:02:10.590> to

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
read about the order of 6 plus is it to

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.110 
read about the order of 6 plus is it to
do<00:02:10.830> all<00:02:10.950> camera<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:11.520> tell<00:02:11.700> us<00:02:11.730> something<00:02:12.060> about

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
do all camera so tell us something about

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.440 
do all camera so tell us something about
that

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
that

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.430 
that
well<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.870> has

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
well it has

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.950 
well it has
so<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.460> got<00:02:14.580> instead<00:02:15.150> of<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.450> one<00:02:15.630> camera<00:02:15.810> in

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
so you got instead of just one camera in

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.290 
so you got instead of just one camera in
the<00:02:16.020> back<00:02:16.170> you<00:02:16.440> have<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.830> win<00:02:17.040> two<00:02:17.670> to<00:02:18.180> eight

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
the back you have to win two to eight

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.790 
the back you have to win two to eight
megapixel<00:02:18.870> ones<00:02:19.050> which<00:02:19.260> allows<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.650> to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
faster focusing better highlights and

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.470 
faster focusing better highlights and
shadows<00:02:21.930> and<00:02:22.710> you<00:02:22.920> get<00:02:23.040> way<00:02:23.610> way<00:02:23.820> way<00:02:23.970> better

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
shadows and you get way way way better

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.560 
shadows and you get way way way better
HDR<00:02:24.840> compared<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.380> any<00:02:25.500> other<00:02:26.030> smartphone<00:02:27.030> so

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
openings which will allow for more

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.180 
openings which will allow for more
longer<00:03:21.120> light<00:03:21.300> exposures<00:03:21.810> as<00:03:22.620> well<00:03:22.830> as<00:03:22.950> the

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
longer light exposures as well as the

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.930 
longer light exposures as well as the
ability<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.820> shoot<00:03:24.440> in<00:03:25.440> larger<00:03:25.980> file<00:03:26.459> formats

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940
