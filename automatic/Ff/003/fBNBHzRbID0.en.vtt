in addition being thin in life this TV

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.299 
in addition being thin in life this TV
also<00:00:45.719> has<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.350> thin<00:00:46.620> bezel<00:00:46.980> around<00:00:47.070> the

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.040 
also has a really thin bezel around the
screen<00:00:47.370> so<00:00:47.789> it's<00:00:47.940> incredibly<00:00:48.329> compact<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:49.020> a

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050
