00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
these and then I'm going to open end 5/8

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.560 
these and then I'm going to open end 5/8
and<00:00:45.170> a<00:00:46.670> 5/8<00:00:47.670> inch<00:00:48.260> socket<00:00:49.879> the<00:00:50.879> Polaris

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
and a 5/8 inch socket the Polaris

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.799 
and a 5/8 inch socket the Polaris
actually<00:00:52.110> most<00:00:52.289> Polaris<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:53.030> use<00:00:54.030> American

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
actually most Polaris is use American

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:58.849 
actually most Polaris is use American
standard<00:00:55.530> sizes<00:00:56.460> surprisingly<00:00:57.680> most<00:00:58.680> other

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
standard sizes surprisingly most other

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.650 
standard sizes surprisingly most other
quads<00:00:59.160> use<00:00:59.399> metric<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.000> think<00:01:00.210> every<00:01:00.539> other

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
quads use metric I think every other

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.460 
quads use metric I think every other
company's<00:01:01.410> metric<00:01:02.750> so<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.840> just<00:01:03.960> a<00:01:04.019> good<00:01:04.199> tip

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
company's metric so it's just a good tip

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.710 
company's metric so it's just a good tip
if<00:01:04.830> you're<00:01:05.060> if<00:01:06.060> you're<00:01:06.210> trying<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.450> figure<00:01:06.689> out

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
if you're if you're trying to figure out

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.649 
if you're if you're trying to figure out
how<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:06.960> work<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.470> your<00:01:07.560> Polaris<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.479> you<00:01:09.479> keep

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
how to work on your Polaris and you keep

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.800 
how to work on your Polaris and you keep
going<00:01:09.780> through<00:01:10.049> every<00:01:10.619> single<00:01:10.920> type<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.810> every

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
going through every single type of every

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.690 
going through every single type of every
single<00:01:13.049> size<00:01:13.260> of<00:01:13.590> socket<00:01:14.010> that<00:01:14.159> you<00:01:14.250> have<00:01:14.400> and

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
single size of socket that you have and

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.880 
single size of socket that you have and
you<00:01:14.760> can't<00:01:14.970> figure<00:01:15.119> out<00:01:15.270> which<00:01:15.720> one<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.200> to<00:01:16.500> fit

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
you can't figure out which one is to fit

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.820 
you can't figure out which one is to fit
on<00:01:17.040> you<00:01:17.610> probably<00:01:17.990> don't<00:01:18.990> have<00:01:19.020> American

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
on you probably don't have American

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.620 
on you probably don't have American
standard<00:01:20.189> sizes<00:01:20.580> I've<00:01:20.970> done<00:01:21.180> that<00:01:21.270> so<00:01:21.479> many

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
standard sizes I've done that so many

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.320 
standard sizes I've done that so many
times<00:01:21.750> or<00:01:22.229> I'll<00:01:22.680> just<00:01:22.920> grab<00:01:23.100> my<00:01:23.640> toolbox<00:01:23.880> which

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
times or I'll just grab my toolbox which

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.480 
times or I'll just grab my toolbox which
has<00:01:24.479> mostly<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.200> metric<00:01:25.710> size<00:01:26.270> tools<00:01:27.270> and

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
has mostly just metric size tools and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.920 
has mostly just metric size tools and
then<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.579> figure<00:01:29.880> out<00:01:29.970> oh<00:01:30.000> yeah<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.390> got<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.869> go

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
then I figure out oh yeah I got to go

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.380 
then I figure out oh yeah I got to go
get<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> American<00:01:31.560> standard<00:01:31.950> sizes<00:01:32.369> so<00:01:32.549> just

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
get the American standard sizes so just

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.219 
get the American standard sizes so just
remember<00:01:33.840> 5/8<00:01:34.470> that's<00:01:34.829> all<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.040> need<00:01:35.220> and

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
chain you have to pull it back towards

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.440 
chain you have to pull it back towards
yourself<00:02:22.740> just<00:02:23.740> I'm<00:02:24.130> just<00:02:24.160> uh<00:02:24.370> you<00:02:25.060> know<00:02:25.150> tell

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
it when I'm actually working on it

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.480 
it when I'm actually working on it
it's<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.170> pretty<00:02:29.530> simple<00:02:29.740> all<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.040> gotta<00:02:30.190> do<00:02:30.370> is

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
it's a pretty simple all you gotta do is

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.699 
it's a pretty simple all you gotta do is
just<00:02:30.610> Jack<00:02:30.940> it<00:02:31.090> up<00:02:31.240> and<00:02:31.510> then<00:02:32.050> loosen<00:02:32.620> those

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
just Jack it up and then loosen those

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.980 
just Jack it up and then loosen those
bolts<00:02:33.130> and<00:02:33.340> then<00:02:33.690> tighten<00:02:34.690> it<00:02:34.750> you're<00:02:34.930> just

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
bolts and then tighten it you're just

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.510 
bolts and then tighten it you're just
going<00:02:35.170> to<00:02:35.230> tighten<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.500> forward<00:02:35.890> and<00:02:36.130> then

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
going to tighten it forward and then

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.180 
going to tighten it forward and then
what<00:02:37.030> I<00:02:37.060> do<00:02:37.180> is<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:37.810> just<00:02:38.320> I<00:02:40.920> basically<00:02:41.920> just

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
what I do is I just I basically just

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.780 
what I do is I just I basically just
tighten<00:02:42.520> it<00:02:42.580> as<00:02:42.730> far<00:02:43.000> as<00:02:43.120> it'll<00:02:43.300> go<00:02:43.330> and<00:02:43.950> then<00:02:44.950> I

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
tighten it as far as it'll go and then I

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:50.780 
tighten it as far as it'll go and then I
won't<00:02:46.660> press<00:02:47.170> it<00:02:47.380> to<00:02:47.590> tighten<00:02:48.220> it<00:02:48.310> any<00:02:48.430> further

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.729 

it<00:02:51.790> seems<00:02:52.450> like<00:02:52.720> once<00:02:53.110> I<00:02:53.230> tighten<00:02:53.530> it<00:02:53.620> all<00:02:53.709> the

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
it seems like once I tighten it all the

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.150 
it seems like once I tighten it all the
way<00:02:53.980> I'll<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:56.260> know<00:02:56.290> tighten<00:02:56.620> the<00:02:56.709> bolts<00:02:56.950> back

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
way I'll you know tighten the bolts back

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.690 
way I'll you know tighten the bolts back
up<00:02:57.370> and<00:02:57.640> then<00:02:58.120> once<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:59.010> get<00:03:00.010> the<00:03:00.130> quad<00:03:00.310> back<00:03:00.520> on

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
up and then once I get the quad back on

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.140 
up and then once I get the quad back on
the<00:03:00.820> ground<00:03:01.090> it<00:03:01.450> has<00:03:02.140> enough<00:03:03.000> flexibility<00:03:04.000> in

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
the ground it has enough flexibility in

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.060 
the ground it has enough flexibility in
the<00:03:04.239> chain<00:03:04.480> it<00:03:04.690> moves<00:03:05.260> up<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.620> down<00:03:05.680> just

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:06.070 
the chain it moves up and down just

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.850 
the chain it moves up and down just
enough<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:08.140> that's<00:03:08.290> just<00:03:08.410> a<00:03:08.530> little<00:03:08.770> that's

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
enough so that's just a little that's

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.510 
enough so that's just a little that's
just<00:03:09.040> what<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:09.190> do<00:03:09.840> you<00:03:10.840> might<00:03:11.220> do<00:03:12.220> things<00:03:12.459> a

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:12.520 
just what I do you might do things a

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.770 
just what I do you might do things a
little<00:03:12.580> bit<00:03:12.760> differently<00:03:13.120> but<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.540> just

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
little bit differently but I just

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.000 
little bit differently but I just
tighten<00:03:14.020> it<00:03:14.050> as<00:03:14.170> far<00:03:14.350> as<00:03:14.380> it'll<00:03:14.620> go

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
tighten it as far as it'll go

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.690 
tighten it as far as it'll go
without<00:03:15.700> over-tightening<00:03:16.060> it<00:03:16.570> so<00:03:17.410> on<00:03:17.950> to<00:03:18.640> the

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
without over-tightening it so on to the

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:24.000

loosen these up you don't have to take
them<00:05:33.820> all<00:05:33.940> the<00:05:34.030> way<00:05:34.120> off<00:05:34.270> if<00:05:35.200> you<00:05:35.350> do<00:05:35.500> take<00:05:35.710> them

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:35.860 
them all the way off if you do take them

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.510 
them all the way off if you do take them
all<00:05:35.980> off<00:05:36.250> I<00:05:36.460> recommend<00:05:37.390> you<00:05:38.350> just<00:05:38.680> put<00:05:39.310> never

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
all off I recommend you just put never

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
seize on the threads that way you can

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:44.820 
seize on the threads that way you can
you<00:05:43.360> know<00:05:43.480> make<00:05:43.690> a<00:05:43.720> lot<00:05:44.050> easier<00:05:44.350> the<00:05:44.470> next<00:05:44.680> time

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
you know make a lot easier the next time

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.790 
you know make a lot easier the next time
you<00:05:44.920> do<00:05:45.040> it<00:05:45.220> they'll<00:05:46.120> keep<00:05:46.360> any<00:05:46.630> rust<00:05:47.560> from

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 
you do it they'll keep any rust from

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.290 
you do it they'll keep any rust from
forming<00:05:47.860> and<00:05:48.490> it'll<00:05:48.700> just<00:05:48.910> be<00:05:49.030> a<00:05:49.060> whole<00:05:49.270> lot

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
forming and it'll just be a whole lot

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.780 
forming and it'll just be a whole lot
easier<00:05:51.240> alright<00:05:52.240> that's<00:05:52.450> pretty<00:05:52.600> loose<00:05:53.790> now

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:54.790 
easier alright that's pretty loose now

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.970 
easier alright that's pretty loose now
next<00:05:55.180> we<00:05:55.390> have<00:05:55.660> to<00:05:55.810> just<00:05:56.440> tighten<00:05:56.650> the<00:05:56.800> chain

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
next we have to just tighten the chain

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:08.260 
next we have to just tighten the chain
up

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:08.270 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.620

I<00:06:20.780> found<00:06:20.990> is<00:06:21.500> that<00:06:21.910> I'm<00:06:22.910> gonna<00:06:23.120> have<00:06:23.300> to<00:06:23.389> make<00:06:23.509> a

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:23.539 
I found is that I'm gonna have to make a

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.460 
I found is that I'm gonna have to make a
video<00:06:23.840> of<00:06:23.870> this<00:06:24.050> to<00:06:24.289> probably<00:06:24.860> is<00:06:25.039> that<00:06:25.699> the

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
video of this to probably is that the

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.839 
video of this to probably is that the
bearings<00:06:27.470> that<00:06:27.680> sit<00:06:28.069> right<00:06:28.430> inside<00:06:28.610> here

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
bearings that sit right inside here

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:31.409 
bearings that sit right inside here
right<00:06:29.630> right<00:06:29.960> where<00:06:30.139> the<00:06:30.199> axle<00:06:30.560> slides<00:06:30.770> in

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
right right where the axle slides in

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:34.150 
right right where the axle slides in
there<00:06:32.419> definitely<00:06:32.660> bad<00:06:33.169> I<00:06:33.199> can<00:06:33.500> I<00:06:33.770> can<00:06:33.979> shake

00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.160 
there definitely bad I can I can shake

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.290 
there definitely bad I can I can shake
the<00:06:34.340> axle<00:06:34.699> up<00:06:34.819> and<00:06:35.000> down<00:06:36.069> so<00:06:37.069> it<00:06:37.910> was<00:06:38.060> very

00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:38.300 
the axle up and down so it was very

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.270 
the axle up and down so it was very
difficult<00:06:38.539> turning<00:06:39.169> this<00:06:39.349> this<00:06:40.069> is<00:06:40.190> this

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 
difficult turning this this is this

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:43.960 
difficult turning this this is this
outside<00:06:40.490> housing<00:06:41.120> here<00:06:42.550> remember<00:06:43.550> just<00:06:43.759> you

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
outside housing here remember just you

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.050 
outside housing here remember just you
put<00:06:44.120> that<00:06:45.009> that<00:06:46.009> rubber<00:06:46.190> strap<00:06:46.520> around<00:06:46.699> here

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:47.060 
put that that rubber strap around here

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:49.480 
put that that rubber strap around here
and<00:06:47.300> then<00:06:47.449> you<00:06:47.539> just<00:06:47.720> push<00:06:48.139> it<00:06:48.320> forward<00:06:48.830> and<00:06:49.099> it

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490 
and then you just push it forward and it

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.730 
and then you just push it forward and it
will<00:06:49.520> tighten<00:06:49.729> the<00:06:49.910> chain<00:06:50.090> up<00:06:50.470> so<00:06:51.470> that's<00:06:51.620> what

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:51.740 
will tighten the chain up so that's what

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.610 
will tighten the chain up so that's what
I<00:06:51.770> did<00:06:51.860> and<00:06:52.190> it's<00:06:52.430> all<00:06:52.610> tightened<00:06:52.880> up<00:06:53.030> now<00:06:53.620> but

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
I did and it's all tightened up now but

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.469 
I did and it's all tightened up now but
yeah<00:06:54.710> if<00:06:55.039> for<00:06:55.580> some<00:06:55.610> reason<00:06:55.970> you<00:06:56.060> can't<00:06:56.240> it<00:06:56.389> was

00:06:56.469 --> 00:06:56.479 
yeah if for some reason you can't it was

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:57.879 
yeah if for some reason you can't it was
it<00:06:56.630> was<00:06:56.720> really<00:06:56.990> hard<00:06:57.229> to<00:06:57.289> turn<00:06:57.530> this<00:06:57.680> that's

00:06:57.879 --> 00:06:57.889 
it was really hard to turn this that's

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.399 
it was really hard to turn this that's
why<00:06:57.979> I<00:06:58.039> didn't<00:06:58.280> film<00:06:58.610> it<00:06:58.789> because<00:06:59.479> I'm<00:07:00.080> sure

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:00.409 
why I didn't film it because I'm sure

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:02.529 
why I didn't film it because I'm sure
all<00:07:00.919> the<00:07:01.310> bearings<00:07:01.639> in<00:07:01.820> here<00:07:02.000> probably<00:07:02.389> filled

00:07:02.529 --> 00:07:02.539 
all the bearings in here probably filled

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:06.249 
all the bearings in here probably filled
up<00:07:02.690> with<00:07:02.780> mud<00:07:03.050> and<00:07:03.080> just<00:07:03.289> destroyed<00:07:03.830> so<00:07:04.780> is<00:07:05.780> it

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:06.259 
up with mud and just destroyed so is it

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:08.110 
up with mud and just destroyed so is it
was<00:07:06.409> hard<00:07:06.680> to<00:07:06.770> turn<00:07:07.009> that<00:07:07.190> thing

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:08.120 
was hard to turn that thing

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.240 
was hard to turn that thing
it<00:07:08.750> took<00:07:08.900> took<00:07:09.440> a<00:07:09.500> while<00:07:09.710> um<00:07:11.560> but<00:07:12.560> at<00:07:12.889> least<00:07:13.009> now

00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:13.250 
it took took a while um but at least now

00:07:13.250 --> 00:07:15.249 
it took took a while um but at least now
you<00:07:13.310> guys<00:07:13.610> know<00:07:13.909> how<00:07:14.419> to<00:07:14.479> do<00:07:14.690> this<00:07:14.840> you<00:07:15.110> have
