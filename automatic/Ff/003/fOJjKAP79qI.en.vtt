strategy<00:02:01.450> let's<00:02:02.079> see<00:02:02.200> how<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.439> would<00:02:02.560> work<00:02:02.590> if

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
strategy let's see how it would work if

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.740 
strategy let's see how it would work if
we<00:02:02.920> did<00:02:03.130> it<00:02:03.220> a<00:02:03.310> perfect<00:02:03.670> walk<00:02:03.789> is<00:02:04.390> everybody

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
we did it a perfect walk is everybody

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.139 
we did it a perfect walk is everybody
ready<00:02:04.840> you<00:02:05.649> see<00:02:05.920> the<00:02:06.159> point<00:02:06.460> is<00:02:06.789> for<00:02:07.000> the

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
ready you see the point is for the

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.449 
ready you see the point is for the
jammers<00:02:07.720> to<00:02:07.990> break<00:02:08.259> through<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:09.009> the<00:02:09.039> front<00:02:09.369> of

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
jammers to break through to the front of

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.339 
jammers to break through to the front of
the<00:02:09.550> pack<00:02:09.759> she's<00:02:10.750> got<00:02:10.869> her<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.050> hold<00:02:11.230> that

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
the pack she's got her to hold that

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:12.780 
the pack she's got her to hold that
inside<00:02:11.680> line<00:02:11.860> it's<00:02:12.069> like<00:02:12.160> another<00:02:12.340> blocker<00:02:12.640> as

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
inside line it's like another blocker as

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.460 
inside line it's like another blocker as
close<00:02:13.000> as<00:02:13.150> you<00:02:13.239> can<00:02:13.330> get<00:02:13.480> through<00:02:13.690> it<00:02:13.750> if<00:02:14.260> you

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470
